00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,866
"Oh, Osiris, the king departed
but that returns."

3
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,203
You fell asleep but awake.

4
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:31,164
You will die but rise again.

5
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:34,332
The vault is open, his tomb more
no longer sealed.

6
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:39,858
The gates of heaven are open "
text of the Pyramid of Unas, Egypt.

7
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:45,491
There long ago in the early stages of humanity

8
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:51,490
Sky came the visitors were called osiris

9
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:55,490
These gods gave us unimaginable gifts

10
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,489
samples that we still had not dreamed

11
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,490
Astronomy,
architecture, culture

12
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,489
But everything has a price.

13
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:13,487
The osiris wanted to own earth.

14
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:18,486
Pharaoh, the most powerful man
, and the sun god Ra

15
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:22,486
fought together against this threat.

16
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:26,485
When visitors were coming
to bring his people to Earth

17
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,486
became an opportunity like that will happen only
here 5000 years ago.

18
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:34,484
When the stars are aligned to one another
.

19
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:38,484
Pharaoh stole their lights
and subjugated the osiris...

20
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:42,483
And left them in a dungeon

21
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:46,483
maze on the bottom of your pyramid.

22
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,482
But some visitors still believed

23
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:54,482
and awaited his return.
The Princess Amanphur was one.

24
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:05,481
Flees with the child
He ​​is the last of the dynasty.

25
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,732
Give thanks to the gods.

26
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:13,165
The cult of Osiris
return to earth.

27
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,478
Exalt his journey to the next world.

28
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,558
She starts
rest in the glory of Ra.

29
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:26,067
Pharaoh knowing that placed the princess under

30
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,764
your pyramid. It was a portal built...

31
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:32,278
For when the stars were aligned again...

32
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:37,810
Visitors would welcome the
a legitimate descendant of the princess...

33
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:43,698
Pharaoh doubted the princess
was really dead.

34
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,757
He made a key
- The Key of Heaven.

35
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,422
Blocking the secrets that were there.

36
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:55,473
A guardian was created to protect the tomb.

37
00:02:58,473 --> 00:03:03,471
He assured that no one talked about the secrets
Tomb

38
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:07,471
so that Osiris could never return.

39
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:11,470
If they returned was
his terrible revenge.

40
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,458
Fire could destroy the Earth for all

41
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,469
Men, women and children died
.

42
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:24,469
The osiris would be rewarded
becoming gods.

43
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,467
The stars are near
are again aligned.

44
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:34,467
But missing The Key of Heaven, and the lost royal descendants

45
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:38,467
for this day... UNTIL NOW.

46
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:43,066
Prisoners of the Sun

47
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:13,387
You're late. Traffic
filled again, huh?

48
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:16,256
I mean, it was terrible.

49
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,110
You are beautiful!

50
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,750
I'm dusty
depots so many hours that should be here, Mr. Adler...

51
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:25,227
- Where is he?
- Inside the tent.

52
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:26,405
Check this out...

53
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,172
Is... gorgeous!

54
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,260
You are amazing!

55
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,868
With all the risks...

56
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:49,839
7 days.

57
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:56,419
The builders of the pyramids did
an exact mirror of the heavens...

58
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:59,946
This image was created
5000 years ago...

59
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:06,453
Seven Days
only one configuration is complete again.

60
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:10,514
I asked Mendella
again yesterday evening. Nothing was found.

61
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,390
Tell him to expand
search warrants.

62
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:14,484
Money is nothing before that.

63
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:15,670
We're wasting time.

64
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,153
No one here plays.

65
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:20,034
I'm dealing with idiots...
Kids...

66
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,047
Take direction.

67
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:27,450
Here  Masterton.
No, I do not.

68
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:34,298
I want tomorrow
Not next week or next month. Tomorrow!

69
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,912
Masterton confirmed to date.
Exactly one week.

70
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,447
Input must be found.

71
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:49,447
I do not understand why
tomb has not been found.

72
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:53,447
He has to be here.
It is my intuition.

73
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:58,446
Increase  excavations.
Night Lights?

74
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:04,445
They come today. Unfortunately there's a storm coming
.

75
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:09,445
- This is great.
- Let's get?

76
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:25,443
You look tired, teacher.
Have you eaten?

77
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:30,442
Very hot.

78
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:41,439
- That's it... -
Not want to know how.

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,439
Why do people
museum are so damn boring?

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,471
They care for relics as if they were
watchdogs...

81
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:58,836
- Noted that. -
Do not look like a spaceship?

82
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:05,437
Could be a symbol of a flying god.

83
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:11,436
Egypt evolved so quickly.
As a human being could not.

84
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:17,434
The change was very fast today...

85
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:21,434
You won the award today.

86
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:27,434
There is something very strange going on here.

87
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:25,425
- Looking for something specific?
- The Key of Heaven.

88
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:34,423
Is very special.

89
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:39,423
Are you and I want it.
We do business?

90
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:47,421
Other
someone is ready to pay for it in abundance.

91
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:51,420
Tonight,
get a good buyer...

92
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,421
I am a very serious man.

93
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:57,420
And who are you?

94
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,905
Mr. Levitz, come with me.
I hope that has not been followed.

95
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,187
No one came near me.

96
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,416
You know the legend
Key of Heaven?

97
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:26,415
An Egyptian sect would have kept the
key guarded by priests...

98
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:31,414
Vanished in the mists of time, Mr.
Levitz.

99
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:35,414
It is said to be a link with
Princess Amanphur.

100
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:38,414
How do I know it is genuine?

101
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,414
How
I know you can pay this treasure?

102
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:13,409
Masterpiece carved.
Miraculously preserved.

103
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,409
Hitler sent archaeologists searching for him.

104
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,408
But remained hidden until now.

105
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:24,175
Test Results of Carbon 14

106
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:28,095
This willing to pay the price, Mr. Levitz
?

107
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:34,406
- What do you think? -
I'll be the first to see it.

108
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:48,404
Twice worth the money.
You will surely agree.

109
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,402
I was thinking of an exchange.

110
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:58,403
This stick is 1800.

111
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:05,402
You're kidding.

112
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:13,401
I'm not kidding.
I am a very serious man.

113
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,079
Mr Khalfani?

114
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,393
Oh, my God!

115
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:12,391
Masterton. - It seems that
looking for a key. - Levitz?

116
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:16,390
- It just changed hands. -
You are a murdering bastard.

117
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,390
Tell me where,
'll send the police after you.

118
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:23,389
Police
is already going to there in a minute.

119
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,389
He was killed with a cane.
Full of a certain fingerprint.

120
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,388
- Clear evidence, Professor.
- You bastard.

121
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,268
What do you want? Money?

122
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:42,209
Money? Would underestimate me.
I want a percentage.

123
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:49,284
- Otherwise, the police will have the
cane. - You will not get away with it.

124
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,116
What do we do?

125
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:01,385
Claire,
I need your advice.

126
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,959
You have to leave.
The storm is coming.

127
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,641
We've come on!

128
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:27,381
A huge storm is coming.
See for yourselves!

129
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:32,785
Everything has to be dismantled.
I will help you!

130
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:33,857
OK, let's go!

131
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,379
For the love of God!

132
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,376
Stay in the car.

133
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:22,373
Someone close to you died recently?

134
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:27,371
This is what I came to talk to you
.

135
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:31,372
The storm did not come about by chance.

136
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:37,371
The secret is revealed.

137
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,369
You will gain something.

138
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,369
A key.

139
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:53,368
Will complete its mission in the coming days.

140
00:14:57,368 --> 00:15:02,366
Powerful Bird Sophus...
Floating in human blood...

141
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:05,366
Not be celebrated.

142
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,365
- The fire comes again.
- What is it, Claire?

143
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:13,364
Signs of Osiris rise up...
Osiris died...

144
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:16,365
- I need to know.
- Not!

145
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:28,363
What is it, Claire...
I need to know.

146
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,362
None. Only a bad view...

147
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:40,362
I'm leaving now.
You were a big help.

148
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,358
Of course, I told him.
He ​​is coming.

149
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:01,357
- What was it? - Professor
insists on seeing it.

150
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:04,313
Let's take a look then.

151
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:22,355
What is it? - What I can not believe supposedly
?

152
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:26,355
What you got for me?

153
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:30,354
Look what the storm revealed.

154
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:37,353
We thought we had lost the game.

155
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:47,352
I knew.

156
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:55,350
Old friend, can get
input for me?

157
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:59,350
My friend is already there.

158
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,348
Invite the rest of the team,
call Sarah, in London.

159
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,349
Tell him that his father
needs her.

160
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:17,321
Masterton! Professor
I would ask...

161
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,862
He has not slept in weeks.

162
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:23,779
Can the quest to wait until later?
He ​​needs a rest.

163
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,384
Dr. Adler! This pyramid is one Astronomical Observatory

164
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:35,344
devoted to celestial events
last 5000 years, repeated every event.

165
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:41,343
The next time will be at 12:37,
Thursday, the 12th of that month.

166
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:45,342
Three days from now, Dr. Adler.

167
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:50,343
I will be within the pyramid in three days!

168
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:20,338
Look at this. Translate
about what I could.

169
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:25,336
Party is destroyed,
some are missing.

170
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,337
Are you okay?
I am here to take you home.

171
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:36,262
- Need to prepare for tomorrow.
- Finished for today.

172
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,560
I'm not very well.

173
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:04,650
Maybe you should convince him to open
only in a few days...

174
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:12,801
Would be nice, but he did
astrological calculations.

175
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,341
He does not change his mind.

176
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,659
Okay then.

177
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,329
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

178
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,323
Your customer came.

179
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:08,322
Have you seen the new pyramid?

180
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:13,321
It's amazing, is not it?

181
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,394
Do you want me to applaud me?

182
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,135
Want an enigmatic advice...
Should...

183
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:26,319
Marry an Egyptian beautiful.
People have a bad habit of disappearing.

184
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,108
- I protect my investments only.
- I wonder what's the investment?

185
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,319
Ici (here)...

186
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:40,318
Au revoir.

187
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:46,316
The Key of Heaven.
You can not enter the tomb without it.

188
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:50,315
I also studied the messages of the gods
the sun for many years...

189
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:54,315
- Tell your price. -
I do not need your money.

190
00:20:54,316 --> 00:21:01,314
If the legend is true, this pyramid has untold riches...

191
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:06,313
- This is my job. -
I'm going with you like it or not.

192
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:12,312
Depots
more than 5000 years, written instructions.

193
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,311
- There is no place for you.
- Okay.

194
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:21,311
A walking stick with their fingerprints is the way to the station.

195
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:27,310
If I do not call
Apurilleni within three minutes...

196
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:30,310
- You get to say goodbye to the pyramid.
- You're bluffing.

197
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,219
Khalfani not think so.

198
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,824
The only camera you can
will visit Cairo is a cell.

199
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,308
Is not a nice place.

200
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:51,306
Take
Key to my office tomorrow and can go...

201
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:57,305
You get the key when we go
to the camera... together.

202
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:02,212
I consider myself dangerous,
suspend delivery.

203
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:15,318


204
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,303
Teacher?

205
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:28,443
Teacher?

206
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,520
Teacher!

207
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,037
Teacher.

208
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,298
- Come on.
- Do not worry.

209
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:57,298
Nothing to worry about.

210
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:05,659
- I'm fine.
- Is not.

211
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:12,295
Listen to Doug, there are 4
years in research with me.

212
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:16,835
- You need to go there. -
I have no experience.

213
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:23,294
- You underestimate yourself. -
Do you have the talent for this work.

214
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:31,314
Use your potential.
You will be able to interpret it.

215
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:37,291
- I'm calling it. - You
what happens tomorrow.

216
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:42,290
You know what
Masterton said the location of the Earth...

217
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,290
The pyramid is more than it seems.

218
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:52,290
Not only is the tomb of the princess.
Is only part of the puzzle.

219
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,289
Look.

220
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,288
Symbols refer to Osiris.

221
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:05,086
You have to go.

222
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,928
Do not worry... 'll survive.
I promise.

223
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:15,286
Would be better.

224
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:20,097
- I think you're Sarah?
- Yes

225
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:23,570
I am Ahmed, his father warned that
office is temporarily closed.

226
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,169
- And the rest of the team?
- Are there tonight.

227
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:42,958
Sarah...

228
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:50,203
- Was passed so long...
- You knew where I was.

229
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:56,280

've Been busy since the death of his mother.

230
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,279
I like to visit the tomb
before we start.

231
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,279
Welcome.

232
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:38,274
Mother, I'm here.

233
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:45,272
You used to sing it when I could not sleep.

234
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,273
Do you remember?

235
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:56,271
Princess Amanphur and his wonderful kingdom.

236
00:25:56,272 --> 00:26:01,271
One day, the rain had turned into
fire.

237
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,269
Princess of innocent
not have to worry about anything.

238
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,269
You called me princess.
I loved.

239
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:20,268
Now I'll find out what happened to you
. I promise.

240
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:35,184
Hey, where the conference is being held
?

241
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,392
- Yes, I will check myself.
- Thanks

242
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,280
Dr. Adler...

243
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:57,262
I am Miss. Masterton I can not find
Teacher Mendella.

244
00:26:57,263 --> 00:27:01,262
My father invited him to his house
. You can contact him?

245
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:06,257
Teacher tired.
Rest for a few hours.

246
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:10,260
Non flew here to
wait for their naps.

247
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,260
Be there in half an hour.

248
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,269
Dr. Adler.

249
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,898
- Hi ..
- I was being harsh.

250
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:36,666
I thought about apologizing for what
told me. Where is Dr. Mendella?

251
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:42,255
Can we talk? -
My father is waiting for me soon.

252
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:47,255
Professor is in the hospital.
His condition is critical.

253
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:51,125
He had a heart attack,
and asked me to come on their behalf.

254
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:56,253
With all due respect, Dr. Adler,
but you are not qualified.

255
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:59,253
Mendella worked with my father for many years.

256
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:05,227
It is unique in its field. You
resembles him in that?

257
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,252
He ​​does not think you should know.

258
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,574
Sarah, this is Adam.
He ​​works with us.

259
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:29,249
Came collaborate.

260
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:36,247
I've heard a lot about you.
And of course, his mother.

261
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:41,882
- Really? - Should I go to
the hotel to others.

262
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:49,245
- Who is he? -
I'll say it again.

263
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:53,018
- Found Mendella?
- He will not come.

264
00:28:53,019 --> 00:29:00,011
He had a heart attack.
He ​​sent his assistant, Dr. Adler.

265
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:03,503
- Where is he?
- I think I pissed him off.

266
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:07,278
Does this man know anything?

267
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,052
He was beside Mendella
the last 4 years...

268
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:16,129
Mendella never had the assistance of fools.

269
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:19,242
This can destroy everything.

270
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:30,240
I was upset at being very cranky...
- Do not want to fight with you.

271
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,413
No doubt about it, Dr. Adler.

272
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:38,238
Can you come to the Sphinx Hotel bar?

273
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:42,106
I apologize for my rudeness.

274
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:45,800
I. ..

275
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,576
- I'll be there.
- Excellent.

276
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:14,179
The sky is beautiful today,
and you even look at me.

277
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,114
I am Professor Rohit Singh of India.

278
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:26,896
And you must be... - Doug Adler.
You're the expert in antiques.

279
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:31,911
Antiques is the future.
Mendella, Where is he?

280
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,230
The last part of the game
is located.

281
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:40,229
- Rohit.
- Teacher Masterton.

282
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,230
Welcome.

283
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,494
Everything is correct.

284
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:49,228
Not only Mendella who can not attend.

285
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:53,227
- Teacher Mendella... sorry...
- Where is he?

286
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,330
He had a heart attack.

287
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:04,226
Your ability to interpret the symbols
must have been a great help.

288
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:12,224
However his assistant, Dr. Adler
promised to do his task.

289
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:19,223
I'm sorry, but Mendella
is the best in its field.

290
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:24,233
For this you need a great
specialist.

291
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:27,222
We'll have to be satisfied with what we have.

292
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:32,221
Dr. Adler has worked with Professor
Mendella the last 4 years...

293
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:37,202
He is much more qualified than
a novice historian.

294
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,539
That's right.

295
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:43,221
Must be nice to take all the information in his head
.

296
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:49,219
Do you think too much data in a
head weigh?

297
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,218
The only credentials without
chi is you, Mr Levitz...

298
00:31:54,219 --> 00:32:01,217
Can I be so brazen to ask
what you do on this journey?

299
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:05,217
The story of desecration
requires more than just knowledge.

300
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:09,216
The excavation of the tomb of Queen Victoria
was a desecration.

301
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:13,216
Depends on what you will do with it.

302
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:20,215
Friends, this expedition
needs us all.

303
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:24,214
Each of you.

304
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:31,213
Let's delve into history like never before.

305
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:36,213
I believe that what we find
can change history.

306
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:41,212
- A Toast to Egypt.
- Cheers.

307
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:09,849
- Is there anything wrong?
- Military.

308
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:12,725
Were not here yesterday...

309
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:31,324
Wonderful, is not it?

310
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:34,474
Shrouded in secrecy.

311
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:37,284
My father searched for life.

312
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,113
Told with your help.

313
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:43,202
I just now included .
My mother raised me alone.

314
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:49,259
- You chose the same profession.
- Searching for lost items.

315
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:53,492
Psychiatrists have much work with us.

316
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:02,200
Sahid is the representative of the Egyptian government.

317
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:08,199
He wants
confirm who did this puzzle back again.

318
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,198
Teacher tells of a miracle, though
get closer to becoming a disaster.

319
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,197
You would have more confidence in
old gods of Egypt.

320
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:21,241
This was to have convinced him.

321
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:28,196
Most reveleção that sandstorms brought

322
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:35,195
is a place of rest,
believe to be the tomb of Princess Amanphur.

323
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:40,194
When the rest of the world
lived in caves, it already existed.

324
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:44,193
When Christ was crucified it was covered with sand.

325
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:50,193
When Columbus sailed the seas
he was hiding and waiting.

326
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:54,192
Waiting for us.

327
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:59,192
Come to the tomb at dawn.

328
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,766
- Are you okay?
- Yes I'm fine.

329
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:28,089
Do you want some tea?

330
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:45,775
Here I am, and I do not even know how
is my own father.

331
00:35:47,185 --> 00:35:51,184
This could be your chance.
He ​​called you here.

332
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:55,184
Not because I wanted to, but
because he needs me.

333
00:35:57,184 --> 00:36:02,799
- I never liked him. - We can not choose our parents
, Sarah.

334
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:05,186
Simply find them.

335
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,327
Professor
is more my father than me...

336
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,181
Where is your mother?

337
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:24,180
Died ten years ago.
One night left of the pyramids.

338
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,178
His body was found the next morning.

339
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:34,753
Police said she was robbed and killed
.

340
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,578
You do not believe?

341
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:43,176
I do not know what to believe.

342
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:48,176
My mother was strong and intuitive.

343
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,175
Probably there was

344
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,175
but not allowed to be burglarized.

345
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,174
I think you are like him.

346
00:37:03,174 --> 00:37:06,173
Thank you for your words.

347
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:11,173
I'm sorry.
I would like to be able to help her.

348
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:15,172
You helped hearing.

349
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:24,171
- Do not worry about me, okay?
- Okay.

350
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:45,168
Be careful with that.

351
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,166
There are exceptions.

352
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:06,164
Two soldiers, Major and
I'll go with you. Right?

353
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:08,498
Okay.

354
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:09,566
Anything else?

355
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:13,785
No one goes to the chamber and back alive.

356
00:38:14,164 --> 00:38:18,163
Only the chosen of the gods
can do it.

357
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,241
He's right.
There is a single access.

358
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:33,466
Nothing like a good curse.

359
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:22,154
Can munch.

360
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:30,153
They violate  hieroglyphics.

361
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:36,151
Are you ready?

362
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:39,151
The entrance is sealed.
Is the only way to go.

363
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,150
This is enough.

364
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:34,143
Wasps.

365
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:44,488
Nests are new. Really.

366
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:49,550
Alright, let's go back.

367
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:54,140
Fall back.

368
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
Calm down.

369
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,137
Sarah...

370
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:18,137
- Do not move. -
I can not move.

371
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:02,130
Oh, my God!

372
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:31,126
We have to help him.

373
00:42:35,126 --> 00:42:38,125
's Too late.

374
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:45,124
Clean Way!

375
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:53,123
Great.

376
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:56,123
Come on!

377
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:02,121
- I was hoping for traps.
- These are the ones.

378
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:06,121
Here is a set of containers for food
. - Come back.

379
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:10,120
I can understand.

380
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:27,117
Is precisely these places, traps.

381
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:29,614
I do not think that they will no longer function
.

382
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:34,877
Tombs were found with the skeletons of thieves.

383
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:40,362
They warn that criminals should leave.

384
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:41,570
Levitz, stop!

385
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:46,169
Levitz!

386
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:52,114
Do not move.

387
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:56,854
Stay right where you are.

388
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,819
Exactly.

389
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:05,112
Mr Levitz,
put the statue back.

390
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:27,109
- Stay where you are. - The camera is unfortunately
armed.

391
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:34,107
Mr Singh, take a look
the floor.

392
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:37,107
The stone floor is definitely
a surprise for us.

393
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:41,106
- There is a map of it.
- We have to leave.

394
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:46,105
How? What do you say?
We are stuck here!

395
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:51,106
- What do you mean?
- We're locked in here.

396
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:57,104
- You just have to find a way out.
- We are looking for the tomb.

397
00:44:57,105 --> 00:45:03,103
And what is behind it.
Gather your courage.

398
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:09,103
We can do it over and over.
Claire knows, is not it?

399
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:15,101
- There are other options.
- I think I have one.

400
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:19,101
Suppose they believed in symmetry.

401
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:22,101
Two left.

402
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,099
Stop!

403
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,099
Take the weight of the stone.

404
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,099
Take the backpack.

405
00:45:55,096 --> 00:46:00,095
- Rohit, the secret is on the rocks.
- Yes

406
00:46:00,096 --> 00:46:04,094
- The right order would be from zero to ten?
- Yes!

407
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,250
The zero was invented much later.

408
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,995
Good observation.

409
00:46:10,094 --> 00:46:12,094
Let's start with a...

410
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:18,093
Two right. A front
for two to the right.

411
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:21,093
A forward
two to the right.

412
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:32,353
- Good work, Mr. Rohit.
- Thank you.

413
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:41,089
forward and two to the right.

414
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:48,089
A forward two to the right.
Be careful, one by one slowly.

415
00:46:57,087 --> 00:47:00,087
Thank you.

416
00:47:07,086 --> 00:47:11,085
Another dead end.

417
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:16,084
- There is a passage. -
Must be locked from the inside.

418
00:47:16,085 --> 00:47:22,083
- What did you say, Adler?
- No, he knows nothing.

419
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:27,082
- Will die if he's wrong.
- Shut up, Levitz.

420
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:32,082
- I go to the hallway.
- I'm going along with it.

421
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:38,081
Let's take a look.
Have you lost something?

422
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,078
These symbols, this place...

423
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,077
- You know the feeling?
- Déjà vu.

424
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:03,078
Happens to me all day since childhood.

425
00:48:07,077 --> 00:48:12,076
- Some wanted to be here.
- Ask your friends this.

426
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:16,076
I'd really like to know.

427
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:38,073
What do you know about
Masterton and my mother?

428
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:44,071
- Everyone has skeletons in the closet.
- What do you mean?

429
00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:48,070
Everything here will not compromise
pianos from his father.

430
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:53,070
And nothing will stop him.
Whatever the cost.

431
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:59,070
- What do you mean? -
I can not say anything more.

432
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:23,065
- Very strange. - It's a man.
Maybe worker.

433
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:27,065
For all that we
can not be ignored.

434
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:34,063
A classic example of this.
See how man is described.

435
00:49:34,064 --> 00:49:36,064
The gods and pharaohs were mummified

436
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:41,063
because they believed knowing the secret of eternal life.

437
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:46,062
So we know the mummification process.

438
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:50,061
This is not common knowledge.
That came from somewhere else.

439
00:49:50,062 --> 00:49:53,061
Look at this.

440
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:58,060
Some kind of device.

441
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:02,059
Find the same in Mexico and India.

442
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,060
How did they get there?

443
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,059
Sleeping up to agree.

444
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:17,058
The sleeper awakens.
The earth trembles underfoot.

445
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:23,057
- Claire? -
Floating on human blood.

446
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:29,055
Osiris rises.
Osiris was dead.

447
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:34,056
The path to the
current rulers and the gods will be opened.

448
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:37,437
What do you think?

449
00:50:37,975 --> 00:50:39,056
I think there's a door here.

450
00:50:39,057 --> 00:50:42,053
"I think"? I think... go fuck yourself!
Are our lives!

451
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:46,054
Come help.

452
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:08,050
Ladies and gentlemen...
Now starts happening.

453
00:51:08,051 --> 00:51:12,050
Good work, Doctor.

454
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:23,047
Ancient Egyptians not spared
distances.

455
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:27,048
Be careful on the stairs.

456
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:16,041
How lovely!

457
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:35,038
The Amanphur Princess.

458
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:39,036
Masterton
spoke my mother was related to Osiris.

459
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:40,764
She had.

460
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:44,834
Apparently, more secrets.

461
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:48,035
And we're all in trouble.

462
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:50,882
Help everyone.

463
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,149
Get the coffin, let's go.

464
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:15,332
Princess  Amanphur,
finally her face!

465
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:17,612
Depots 5000 years.

466
00:53:17,613 --> 00:53:20,216
Princess Amanphur...

467
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:23,541
Was the whore of the Pharaoh!

468
00:53:26,031 --> 00:53:32,029
This is just smoke and mirrors,
mode not to reveal the tomb.

469
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:38,028
- This is a historic tomb! -
The History was written by kings.

470
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:41,663
- And by the gods.
- Mr Levitz.

471
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,566
The time has come. The key!

472
00:53:57,254 --> 00:53:59,026
The Key of Heaven.

473
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,461
The key?

474
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:07,025
To Mendella this was the sacred Holy Grail.

475
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:12,023
We knew it was there.
Some thought it was a myth.

476
00:54:12,024 --> 00:54:16,023
Hitler asked for it.

477
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:22,022
But eventually stopped in my hands.

478
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:51,018
We did not come here to get
gold or trinkets.

479
00:54:52,018 --> 00:54:58,599
The true treasures are buried
with this shimmering facade below.

480
00:55:29,013 --> 00:55:32,012
- Are you okay?
- I am.

481
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:35,208
There is something here .

482
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:38,937
will find us where ever we are.

483
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:41,953
Be careful.

484
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:45,010
- OK?
- OK.

485
00:55:54,009 --> 00:55:57,008
The place is like a maze.

486
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:03,007
Do not "like a maze."
This is the maze.

487
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:07,006
A maze of traps.
Where is the treasure?

488
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:12,005
It is found in the deepest part of the labyrinth and
more dangerous.

489
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:17,005
A treasure trove of over 5,000 years forgotten.
The lost temple of Osiris.

490
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:22,004
- Just a myth.
- This does not look good.

491
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:26,003
I go first, you follow me and you
, Levitz, the last.

492
00:56:26,004 --> 00:56:30,003
You already have enough problems.

493
00:56:30,004 --> 00:56:33,003
Careful now.

494
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,999
Masterton! Stop this nonsense!

495
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Levitz!

496
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,997
Were trapped inside.

497
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:10,997
- Doug! - Can you hear us?
Oh, my God!

498
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:14,996
I need all .
You're expendable!

499
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:17,468
Calm down, for now.

500
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:19,212
What we look for?

501
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:22,995
Symbols, hieroglyphs.
Something light inside.

502
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:26,995
Back  can not.

503
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:33,994
Returning the same way and look the other way.

504
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,993
Right here. Let's get going.

505
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:45,993
Hold.
Many times slaves were building trails.

506
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,218
Masterton.

507
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:11,989
We must continue down.

508
00:59:01,981 --> 00:59:07,733
- What happened? -
He ​​fell and broke his neck.

509
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,980
- Can we go up? -
We do not know where we fall.

510
00:59:15,979 --> 00:59:18,978
What is this?

511
00:59:18,979 --> 00:59:21,979
Who's there?

512
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,978
Do what you must.

513
00:59:30,977 --> 00:59:33,977
Come on.

514
00:59:34,977 --> 00:59:37,976
Slowly now.

515
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:44,975
Grasp the handle.

516
00:59:45,975 --> 00:59:47,975
- Beware.
- Do not worry.

517
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:53,974
Imagine that this is an elevator.

518
00:59:54,974 --> 00:59:57,973
- Are you okay?
- Yes

519
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,970
- Doug!
- What happened?

520
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:26,969
The soldier...

521
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:46,965
Listen, Levitz, you
is a corrupt, evil character.

522
01:00:46,966 --> 01:00:51,964
The Egyptian civilization is the beginning of a
of the biggest puzzles of history.

523
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:54,964
How suddenly started
bloom along the Nile.

524
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:58,963
Maybe its origin was elsewhere.

525
01:00:58,964 --> 01:01:02,964
We are looking for an answer to this
.

526
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:18,960
I do not like this place.

527
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:21,961
"Sleepers, wake up."

528
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:25,656
"In human blood, floating."

529
01:01:25,657 --> 01:01:28,070
- What is it?
- I do not know.

530
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:31,301
Came just try it?
As important as the key?

531
01:01:31,302 --> 01:01:33,362
Want to play with me?

532
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,924
Who are you?

533
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:41,958
I'm just a canal...

534
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:48,957
The messages from the other side pass me by.

535
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,956
Something is wrong!
Very wrong!

536
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:04,954
- Doug, are you? -
What the hell are you doing?

537
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:08,954
Sorry.
Sought one way out.

538
01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:12,954
Found a soldier.
He ​​had fallen.

539
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:23,952
You're still alive. This way.

540
01:03:06,946 --> 01:03:10,944
- So many dead...
- Protected from light.

541
01:03:10,945 --> 01:03:16,943
- What did they see?
- Are victims of the Sun

542
01:03:16,944 --> 01:03:19,944
They are not people.

543
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,939
- What is it? -
I heard something.

544
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:03,936
- What was that?
- Mouse.

545
01:04:03,937 --> 01:04:06,936
Do not get hysterical, Levitz.

546
01:04:06,937 --> 01:04:09,936
It was just a mouse.

547
01:04:21,935 --> 01:04:26,933
You're like a frightened child
college in the cemetery.

548
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:29,933
No wonder I'm nervous.

549
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:32,619
Some of us are dead, Levitz.

550
01:04:33,755 --> 01:04:35,329
Could be you.

551
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:39,932
You bring bad luck.

552
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:04,928
She was attacked .

553
01:05:09,928 --> 01:05:11,927
What is this?

554
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:18,926
What the hell?

555
01:05:46,922 --> 01:05:49,921
You need to find the exit.

556
01:05:49,922 --> 01:05:53,921
I am watching others.
You'll be fine. Go!

557
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:31,916
You! Follow me!

558
01:06:39,915 --> 01:06:42,914
I found a portal front!

559
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,913
Come on!

560
01:06:49,913 --> 01:06:51,913
Not!

561
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,909
Come on!

562
01:07:52,904 --> 01:07:55,903
Sahid is dead.

563
01:07:57,903 --> 01:08:00,902
Is fascinating.

564
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:06,901
Fascinating? Sahid is dead,
Levitz almost too... how can?

565
01:08:06,902 --> 01:08:09,901
You're not listening!

566
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:14,900
- Son of a bitch!
- Hear Me!

567
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:20,899
I wonder how Levitz has the key.
He ​​murdered Khalfani. A killer!

568
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:25,899
The murder weapon was in a police station.
With their fingerprints on it!

569
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:31,897
What creature was what is there?

570
01:08:31,898 --> 01:08:33,623
What was it?

571
01:08:33,624 --> 01:08:36,362
That... is...

572
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:44,363
The former guardian  inside the pyramid.
Protecting against intruders in the tomb.

573
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:49,896
But that will not stop me!

574
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:56,895
- I will not stop! - Will kill you
as did my mother?

575
01:09:15,892 --> 01:09:17,891
Look.

576
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,891
Look!

577
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:32,889
Is not here.

578
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:37,889
And all these years
theories have been ridiculed.

579
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:40,888
See!

580
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:46,381
Doug. Find a way
I go.

581
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:50,887
Is the only way to get out of here alive
Sarah.

582
01:10:00,885 --> 01:10:04,885
No one should look for the obvious.

583
01:10:05,884 --> 01:10:08,883
This means Osiris.

584
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:13,882
Osiris rises.
Osiris was dead.

585
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:17,883
The name of the oldest form of a
name written with two characters.

586
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,881
The name is represented by a throne and an eye.

587
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:27,880
God opens the eyelids of the eye.

588
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:30,880
The wonderful bird, Sothis.

589
01:10:30,881 --> 01:10:33,879
On the other  name is Sirius, the star of Ham

590
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,868
Sirius was a bright star that can be seen

591
01:10:36,881 --> 01:10:39,879
in the sky when the pyramids were built
.

592
01:10:41,879 --> 01:10:43,879
Here.

593
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,878
Doug, hurry up, please.

594
01:11:02,876 --> 01:11:07,110
Sarah! Remember:
you are the key!

595
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,870
Come on!

596
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,870
Go through the door!

597
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,860
Adam!

598
01:12:56,859 --> 01:13:00,859
This is some kind of ancient generator.

599
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:06,858
Come on, cowboy.
Not need you anymore.

600
01:13:07,858 --> 01:13:09,858
No, Doug.

601
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:13,857
What are you doing?

602
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:22,855
The genetic code
Amanphur only exists intact in female offspring.

603
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:27,855
You are a direct descendant of Princess Amanphur
.

604
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,854
- We need your blood.
- Not!

605
01:13:41,853 --> 01:13:45,852
I'm fine.

606
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:51,851
Rohit...

607
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:08,848
If your mother had agreed to
cooperate, he would be here now

608
01:14:08,849 --> 01:14:11,847
witnessed this resurrection.

609
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:15,847
- "Refused to cooperate"?
- He was by my side

610
01:14:15,848 --> 01:14:20,847
and to get involved with a new historical era.
But she refused.

611
01:14:23,847 --> 01:14:28,846
Let the sleeping agree.

612
01:15:20,838 --> 01:15:26,838
This knowledge has passed through countless generations.

613
01:15:27,837 --> 01:15:31,837
- You can prevent this from happening.
- No, Rohit.

614
01:15:32,837 --> 01:15:34,835
You are welcome back...

615
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:38,836
Stay with us.

616
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:43,834
E come from death to life.

617
01:15:43,835 --> 01:15:51,834
In the end, the human race will
reach their full potential!

618
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:36,827
Look at the Suns!

619
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:45,826
Your blood will connect us all.
Too late!

620
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:37,818
Give me that.

621
01:17:43,818 --> 01:17:46,817
This is over!

622
01:18:39,809 --> 01:18:42,809
Oh, my God!

623
01:19:17,804 --> 01:19:19,804
We're here.

624
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:24,802
You were very brave.

625
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:27,802
You saved my life, thank you.

626
01:19:29,049 --> 01:19:30,767
No, thank you.

627
01:19:39,801 --> 01:19:42,800
They are there... somewhere.

628
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,800
Hoping to return here.

629
