1
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:38,361
I am the supervisor.

2
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,405
I was originally a human.

3
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,441
I see it all.

4
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,242
Coming from the year 2518.

5
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,306
I can keep track of all sides of the galaxy.

6
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,476
It's 200 years after the rise of the group.

7
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,282
Evidence from genetic experiments.

8
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,289
Evidence of an unknown technology.

9
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,349
Evidence of human DNA
inserted DNA is not known.

10
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,487
Source, the outside world and everything.

11
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,290
Pieces voice believed to be the supervisor.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,336
Evidence about the
supervisor prior to modification.

13
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,464
The discovery that is was
highly sensitive information.

14
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,245
Recording history has risen.

15
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,381
Complex life is rare in the universe.

16
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,352
It is believed that intelligent life begins
on earth.

17
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:31,413
But I find that advanced technology
more than a million a year earlier.

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,287
Creatures of this world,

19
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,357
Master who visited Earth in the past

20
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,301
and accelerate our evolution.

21
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,502
Unfortunately, the human empire rose.

22
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,553
Wise enough to do
space travel.

23
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,409
This is the first foundation of the federation.

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,277
The world discovered that the earth

25
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:07,349
and capable of changing the world
be thousands of copies of the earth.

26
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,330
Unofficially, the machine
intelligence becomes dominant

27
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,424
and we tackle them all.

28
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:20,361
We fight and we win
at twenty-eight billion lives.

29
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,310
I was born in the midst of this terrible war.

30
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,436
When you can stop it in three million.

31
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,252
Through the blood of a master, I became immortal.

32
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,348
I have been given a vision and I
have found two great federations.

33
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,453
I have chosen my preferred program.

34
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,459
I have made the earth as much force
and some other colonies.

35
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,462
But someone must be responsible for
the future of the human race.

36
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,408
As long as we fix,
restore, and breathing.

37
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,275
Mankind will be back on the victory.

38
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,472
The kindness of the Master has given me
extension of lives.

39
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,384
But now I have to bring myself
for further modification.

40
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,288
If Masters is embedded in my DNA.

41
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,257
I will live and will be returned.

42
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,261
If this fails, it will
take my life experiments.

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,494
If I survived, I claimed the throne and
supervisor immortal.

44
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,298
And control the entire galaxy.

45
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,377
Those who oppose me must die.

46
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,318
200 YEARS LATER

47
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,391
Terminus.

48
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,351
The capital of the world.

49
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,253
Great empire has fallen.

50
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,401
I grew up in the twilight of a great empire.

51
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,267
It starts from cleaning the entire
empire crumbling

52
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,432
and construction of something new.

53
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,277
Even as a boy,
I can feel the damage.

54
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,246
Handcuff. Only a matter of time.

55
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:21,384
We oppose dumb wars
Terranostra this fight.

56
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,230
We asked supervisors galaxy

57
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,325
started to provide funding for the war
and to help its own people.

58
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,368
Puppet federation.

59
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,372
We ask you to think about ...

60
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,475
My father,

61
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,402
Revolutionary famous local,

62
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,470
brave, strong and assertive.

63
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:46,341
Overnight campaign watchdog agency.

64
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,253
- 18 YEARS LATER.
- This is the beginning of many things.

65
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,446
I survived in 5.3 minutes

66
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,253
I can take the exam.

67
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,290
One chance in a thousand.

68
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,372
Federation rushed.

69
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,305
And those censored.

70
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,502
My dream grows in silence.

71
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,307
Flight lieutenant, Chaplain.

72
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,343
Lt. flight, Worthy.

73
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,516
Worthy?

74
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,318
General, do we know
someone with the name Worthy?

75
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,315
Yes, there are people who do not agree,
I believe.

76
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,419
But he's been killed.

77
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,527
Oh, yes.

78
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,386
There is a relationship?

79
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,397
There is no relationship, the Supreme Commander.

80
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,467
I understand.

81
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,231
Flight lieutenant, Trapper.

82
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,337
Flight lieutenant, Cathrine.

83
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,501
Pilots typically lasts
for 3 minutes in battle.

84
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,305
Jet fighter through federation
as much credit 180000 per year.

85
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,407
If you're crashing and survived,
you're not going to fly anymore.

86
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,420
I hope I said it clearly.

87
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,390
Any one of these?

88
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,483
Oversupply. inventory vessel
got this all.

89
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,261
Is this legal?

90
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,296
Maybe, do not know.

91
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,460
Do you think our riches
should be used for charity?

92
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,301
This concentration of space ...
Space will last for ...

93
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,438
six months.

94
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,374
Wealth is not used for charitable federations.

95
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,340
No, Captain.

96
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,402
By the way, I was promoted.

97
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,344
Flight lieutenant.

98
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,474
- Oh, good.
- Yes, no more misery.

99
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,313
Why did you join the federation?

100
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:26,328
I want to fly.

101
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,673
- Do you want to fly?
- Yes, Captain.

102
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:32,349
Hey, are you sure?

103
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:52,227
Fear, anger becomes a punishment.

104
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,499
Storm clouds gathered, and
The new command will appear soon.

105
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,254
We find something there.

106
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:18,260
A 2000 years old warehouses.

107
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:23,291
What do you believe are the descendants
horrible creatures?

108
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,426
His master?

109
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,371
Yes, master.

110
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,243
Everything came together to prove
our relationship with God.

111
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,276
I am the Lord.

112
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,347
Of course you, dear.

113
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,253
- You are the king.
- There are more ...

114
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,516
It is the former warehouse of DNA.

115
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,495
It has been abandoned.

116
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,494
We can take it all.

117
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,787
I'll miss you when you go.

118
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,537
I will.

119
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,476
Terranostra

120
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,385
was sent to prison for the federation.

121
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,416
Controlled by some religious populations

122
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,459
who all love to hate.

123
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,421
You could say there is a cancer that grows
in their rankings.

124
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:30,333
The new weapon could threaten Terra supervisor
and the evil federation.

125
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,405
It is the prototype of a battle star.

126
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,499
The fastest, emotionless, and rough
in the federation.

127
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,371
Bringing thousands of missile destroyers.

128
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:46,248
Each missile can destroy
each lives in the world 9.

129
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:51,483
I, supreme king Terranostra
declared war against the federation

130
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,424
and to keep the peace.

131
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,419
Stay with us.

132
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,391
You'll be safe.

133
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,493
You'll be fine.

134
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,570
We've all experienced it.

135
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,515
Earth.

136
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,342
A set of radiation.

137
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,418
Battle wounds.

138
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:30,354
The ghosts of our ancestors still
haunt this hallowed ground.

139
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,371
Terranostra plane surface.

140
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,279
Tumbangkan them.

141
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,248
Aye, Captain.

142
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,525
All hands prepare for battle.
Maximum shielding.

143
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,325
Oh, no, no, no.
Not now.

144
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,525
Arms control, filling
battery on the target machine.

145
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,423
Weapons loaded, locked, Captain.

146
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,335
- Locked.
- Shoot!

147
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,318
- Two more came around, Captain.
- They saw it.

148
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,254
Captain, I recommend not involved.

149
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,809
- Shielding electro unstable.
- If so, make it stable.

150
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,296
Lost his shield, Captain.

151
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,425
If you want to shield,
I recommend ...

152
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,366
- 3 missiles again.
- Take a shot.

153
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,268
Pilot, 28000 miles and comes around ...

154
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,442
Communication dead.

155
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,511
Are the missiles ready?

156
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,312
Briefly.

157
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,373
The weapon is ready.

158
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,483
Come around.

159
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,419
Turbo at 76.28 on 79.

160
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,284
- Aye, Captain. 79.
- Shoot!

161
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,360
Oh, no. No. No.

162
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,382
Good job.

163
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,438
You deserve it.

164
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,307
Thank you.

165
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,336
We need to talk later.

166
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,346
About us?

167
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,445
It was always about us.

168
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,416
We are under the federation.

169
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,429
Leave us.

170
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,471
How many men did you kill?

171
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,312
6o.

172
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,352
I would give sufficient numbers.
I want you to play in this operation.

173
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,482
Justice.

174
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,489
- Remove the rope.
- Fuck you!

175
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,294
Very good, suffered in the violence.

176
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:15,245
- Execution you will be suffering.
- We will rise up.

177
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,252
Fuck, rebellion come!

178
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,229
There is no fight pilots
who was on the bridge with you.

179
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,290
Yes, the captain.
Watch and learn, captain.

180
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,369
Ah ..

181
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,364
Remember all the people. You are
man in the service of ..

182
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:48,276
You are an important part of the machine
known by the federation.

183
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,475
If one of us Flater.
We all Flater.

184
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,477
Our first mission as an battleship crew 1,
is visited Earth long.

185
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,484
Stupid name for a planet.

186
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,437
- Did you take the antibiotic pills I?
- Not.

187
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,242
- Do you want one?
- I do not need.

188
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,360
Protective layer on the ship early aktivasikan.

189
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,474
Take expert.

190
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:30,372
No. All existing robot
The core will pull the federation.

191
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,509
100 tax, we become slaves federation.

192
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,793
And you say this with guns blazing
leads to us.

193
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,352
We watched a bit of disagreement
you're up there. Weapon without a protector,

194
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,291
- There is no communication.
- Hi, honey. You do not realize ...

195
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,388
They will shoot on the planet
This, as we were in the service.

196
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,331
Crummy became a federation.

197
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,429
Hi, dear, you're not aware they would shoot
on this planet as we are still in service.

198
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,371
Re-connected remote communication.

199
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,306
Get the bastard back here.

200
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,277
- Yes, sir.
- Put me to the General Gustav.

201
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,438
I think we are pursuing Teronosta.

202
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,219
Do you really want to question me,
General?

203
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,233
I know, but we should have a definition ..

204
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,484
Mother's disappointment. Order has been
so steeped in history.

205
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,330
Following command. Supreme commander.

206
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,457
Nice. Disbanded.

207
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,267
Between putting yourself
under federal regulations ...

208
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:32,344
Or forced to eat meat and drink tiruanmu
artificial food using mind control.

209
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,311
We have to go.
I'm so sorry.

210
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:58,359
Tell a civilian mechanic was that their lives will
lost if he could not get rid of protector.

211
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,302
- Yes, the captain.
- Tim lander deck.

212
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,397
Parameters of about 10,000 km,
safe distance.

213
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,377
At the climax 2.

214
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,286
- I do not like this job.
- You are both to the bridge now.

215
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,252
Yes, we know. We know.

216
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,449
- Where did you go?
- I obey. Get out of my way!

217
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,427
- You fucking whore!
- Fuck you, dirt toilet.

218
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,457
Asshole!

219
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,441
Please.

220
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,336
I've been consulting directly
with the high command.

221
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,350
Order to be removed, in charge
conspiracy with Teronosta.

222
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,479
Provide them with
robot class 4.

223
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,487
- Do you understand the command, captain?
- Understand, general.

224
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,228
- Negotiation failed.
- They want to shoot the ship.

225
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,357
Reamer, Reamer!

226
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,401
Climax 2. At the target and ready.

227
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,303
Target. Earth.

228
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,341
- What we have to do it again?
- Doubt me anymore, warrior Togras.

229
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,500
Yes, captain!

230
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,279
- Got a problem locking ...
- Do it.

231
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,241
What a damn?

232
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,469
The command delay, abort!

233
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,303
Marta! I will protect you!

234
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,247
- Are you fucking Muni?
- Worty?

235
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:57,448
- You take the oath of legium.
- Did you know legium will lock out the air?

236
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,353
Do it!

237
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,467
Vehicles approaching!

238
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,344
Defense guns connected.

239
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,243
Shoot!

240
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,253
Fucking asshole!

241
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,285
Let's drop this bird!

242
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,398
I supreme commander warship, we
fought with Muni Teronosta!

243
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,393
We do not Teronosta!

244
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,335
Bring to the atmosphere,
their weapons will be damaged.

245
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,303
It was a bad idea.

246
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,500
- Do it!
- Not!

247
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,302
I fly a better ship.

248
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,312
- I'm getting one.
- Stay focused.

249
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,495
Do not shoot, do not shoot!
My bullet discharged.

250
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:27,344
I'm with you. Command on the right side.

251
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,505
Back to the engine room.

252
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,397
- Fall!
- Marta, skip Tetoren!

253
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,228
- I will ..
- Use the maneuvering process.

254
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,393
- Not an option!
- Tell me!

255
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,333
We're going to hit!

256
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,267
Escape pod!

257
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,465
- There is only one self-rescuer pod!
- That's it?

258
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,367
We are prototypes.

259
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,474
Glacial tactics. If we turn the gas from
machines and we use blow slowed.

260
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,447
- It will blow up the ship.
- Not in this speed.

261
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,316
- The window will explode in touch.
- Do it, Torgass as claimed.

262
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,411
I hope you're better Munti planet!

263
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,322
Take one to silver!

264
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,289
Silver one another.

265
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,487
Do that, to the bridge.

266
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,301
Jason!

267
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,473
- It worked!
- It does not work!

268
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,243
Bring another puff.
Preparing to blow!

269
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,470
You're a fucking idiot!

270
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:48,315
You want motivated people into war?
Give them a reason to fight!

271
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,260
Feed their anger.

272
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,457
302, received orders the commander in chief.
We need permission to go.

273
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,261
- 039 932.
- At confirm.

274
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:10,475
- The ship will never fly again.
- Oh, he's strong, dear. He will fly.

275
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,307
After some repairs.

276
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,481
- Continue to build better ships.
- That the tax dollars of hard work, it's there.

277
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,333
All federal departments are already in execution
sabagai called the exclusion of Terra Nostar.

278
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,682
It is estimated at least 30 women
already in execution in the underground network.

279
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,274
Denied by the government in the civil war
the damage on the road.

280
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,470
Expected that high consultant Terra Nostar
will make a formal conference against the federation.

281
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,515
In a few hours, the question
was where the protectors?

282
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,251
And why is the government silent?

283
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:51,311
Missionary, I need now to
Bring in the population.

284
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,484
And they like a declaration of war,
we will have the first win.

285
00:24:56,294 --> 00:25:01,254
With a large army of Terra Nostar.
Calista 2 already fallen.

286
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:05,402
Missionary, I need now to
bring justice in the republic's population.

287
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,404
- It's ready?
- Set the time machine.

288
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,408
- I've given it was issued. Immediately.
- How fast?

289
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,410
Office!

290
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,339
You're both, to the protection now.

291
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,336
I do not see why I
The bay bridge?

292
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,318
- What is it?
- Calista 2.

293
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,353
Oh my god.

294
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,253
Son.

295
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,223
And many others.

296
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,399
I fully grieve.

297
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,305
I met Terra agent Nostar
The warship 1.

298
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,437
Yes.

299
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,438
That's why I'm here, General.

300
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,390
TERRA NOSTAR
HARBOR FREIGHT

301
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,498
Greetings ladies.

302
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,510
I never expected this.

303
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,441
We have an order that the warship
already included in the issue.

304
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,418
- Terra Nostar?
- We do not know.

305
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,422
We lost contact of them.

306
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,480
You give us the name?

307
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,363
Which one of you is Ustobor?

308
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,325
He was gone yesterday.

309
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,400
We have 528 legium ready for action
but none of them lead.

310
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,415
You know what it's worth, we sell
missile climax, and we buy boats rover.

311
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,255
No, we can not allow missile
are in the black market.

312
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,523
What level of warships?

313
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,458
Level of thing?

314
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,495
- Are you good?
- Yes, I need a reliever me.

315
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,296
You got it?

316
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,240
Yes, I had trouble last week.

317
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,502
If the power back, it
fine. One other thing.

318
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,442
Where is he, captain?

319
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,311
He was already dead.

320
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,449
This is for 4 days.

321
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,351
You're already discussing it.

322
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,266
Do you need help ...

323
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,509
And ...

324
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,364
He has been born again.

325
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,395
First 3 years, I do not want him.

326
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,274
I told you to love him.

327
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,479
I could not breathe with the weight,
without the breakup.

328
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,514
Already paid your son's life.

329
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,421
There is no guarantee ...

330
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:30,334
In death.

331
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,402
In death.

332
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,554
We do this because of one thing.

333
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,276
- Okay ...
- You join the rebellion.

334
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,514
What rebellion?

335
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,471
I have to show you.

336
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,249
- No, we can not discuss ...
- Jolli.

337
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,414
Come here.

338
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:02,525
So, he lived here, with a special weapon
for all classes.

339
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,496
Some are already emerging.

340
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:12,499
- Terrific.
- Federation had a period of 200 million people.

341
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:16,438
Class 2, which is in the middle.

342
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,315
They were looking for something.

343
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,477
- The scared because ...
- You guys, it's nothing, but it is not like that.

344
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,454
Young man, I appreciate your idealism.

345
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,483
But you can feel it all.

346
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,457
Only 2 sides again.

347
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,203
When they are in a federation.

348
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,372
The same size as you.

349
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,498
Engaged in a different way.

350
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,504
You have the energy of existing federation.

351
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,347
And you've come here.

352
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,486
We want to see this.

353
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:08,494
[WHISPERS]

354
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,303
We need young leaders to control
that.

355
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,339
Are you prepared?

356

375
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,364

377

00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,841

00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,320
Listen, you want a revolution? Back to the car.

386
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,289
Who said anything about a revolution?

387
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,488
I build it back.

388
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,426
I do not like this, oh great.

00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,534

00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,642
I want to bring my son to you.

394
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,422
No.

395
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:32,258
He will be the biggest asset in your life.

396
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,464
He had to stop it.

397
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,497
I'm not fine.

398
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:42,311
You have to move past the target
large.

399
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,415
It is better for you.

400
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,572
You did good, kid.

401
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,516
What are you doing?

402
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,459
I consider it gone.

403
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,228
Move there.

404
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,298
Without my gear, captain.

405
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,471
We will be back.

406
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,469

00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,469
Very royal?

408
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,510
Everything is empty but worthy.

409
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,284
The second room there.

410
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,452
Look at her.

00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,321
I locked.

419
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,486
For the agents, all wars with agents,
not with you.

420
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,422
Surrender now or you're not
executed.

421
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,293
Under federal law, and the politicians.

422
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,339
We are in a lot of trouble.

423
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:21,309
Listen, the commander of the entire aircraft.

424
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:32,421
Can you do this? In an announcement?

425
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,764
Give me, I could hack it.

426
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:42,324
You know a component like this?

427
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:48,267
Damn, if you follow me, your son
will be executed.

428
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,238
All right sir.

429
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,337

To the whole world.

00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,494
I require both sides to open negotiations.

442
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,371
And this firing.

443
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,237
It comes from the earth system.

We, the orbit of the section, I was able to
take this war dream.

- Now you should be here ...
- No, I'm coming.

447

They begin to open fire.

450
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,960
Are we able to shoot back?

451
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,374
We have no prisai.

452
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,288
They fired into the air.

453
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,238

00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,296
I've definitely nervous.

538
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,265
The worst pilot I've ever seen.

539
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,274
I know what you're gonna say,
I'll get right to work.

540
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,273
Who do you side with?

541
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,246
Oh, general very good to me.

542
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:10,345
I remember when you were a baby,
I see you're almost like a dead silence.

543
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,447
I can read through your eyes
to reveal your soul to me.

544
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,360
You can not hide anything from me.

545
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,362
As soon as you're done, come back.

546
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,332
Understandable.

547
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,460
My artificial humans will look for you.

548
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:31,237
Chaos brought confusion,
able to occupy the impending war.

549
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,276
It will be over soon dear.

550
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,503
As soon as the starter in hand,
back to Dominic.

551
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,373
I'm surprised you guys are still intact
after landing it.

552
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,510
This is Diana and I Terina. Hai.

553
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,561
They are all ready for you.

554
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:49,292
Yes ladies. You may break,
boss in town for a business.

555
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:54,521
Sword huh?

556
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,357
Aha.

557
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:02,301
PRIME GRUDA
WORLD unmapped: WEST outer ring.

558
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:12,372
Robot 2 has completed scanning,
DNA in the sector.

559
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,314
Make sure nothing is disturbed.

560
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,453
What is left should stay that way.

561
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,285
Yes sir, overseer. We understand.

562
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,422
D robot control work.

563
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,456
What did he test?

564
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,301
Investigate evidence of their location.
Do they live.

565
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,155
Maybe they just moved to another planet.

566
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,337
I have given the order to move
remaining goods to the ark.

567
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:49,411
No one shall be woken,
done with great care.

568
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,388
POL MARIS MONTH NOT LISTED

569
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:15,240
Federation could use the system
the electric shield ridiculous.

570
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,966
I know all the shields are the best.

571
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,448
Do you agree dear?

572
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,511
Fuck you.

573
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:25,379
Set trajectory towards earth.
There are soldiers we have to wake up.

574
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:35,522
- Music?
- Hey.

575
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,294
Complicated encryption, surely the secret word
valuable to be stored.

576
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,263
We know they are looking for some kind of DNA decoder.

577
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,622
It should be relatively easy.

578
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:50,436
It is more complicated than a simple thread,
The 12 zetabit.

579
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,278
Wow.

580
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:58,413
I will create a tracking alert
so he returned to the source

581
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,353
and we can see what they are looking for.

582
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,458
[ALARM BLARING]

583
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,994
Sounds like they've arrived.

584
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,325
- They were in a hurry but they sure ...
- What?

585
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,385
Total destruction of all major cities
with radiation bomb.

586
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,390
- Not.
- I'm sorry.

587
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,401
In fact the whole army in the mountains
waiting to be activated.

588
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,497
John Worthy?

589
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,342
Do you know me?

590
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,275
The whole galaxy shipper.

591
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:57,490
Oh yes.

592
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:02,281
Diana charge of 500 and 28 legions
in Teranostra.

593
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:06,480
We are authorized for the robot wars purchased
and paid by insurgents.

594
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,492
I understand.

595
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,256
You take care of the federation and we will
Teranostra care of.

596
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,349
Where have you been?

597
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,644
He was on earth, why we have not met
he or intercept?

598
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,807
I know I've got a plan, calm down.

599
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,245
Oh really you have a plan?

600
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,316
- I have a special vehicle.
- I'm sick of the damn plan

601
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,361
- I need results.
- Terina calm.

602
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,430
- Everything is under control.
- Do not touch me or

603
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,362
I'll send someone to shoot.

604
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,229
You understand Gustav?

605
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,232
Give me a chance,
You have to trust me.

606
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:24,322
The rest of the fleet ... has been intercepted.

607
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,496
Jolli.

608
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,382
I do not feel anything.

609
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,360
This is not my own anymore.

610
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,399
Let's make them suffer.

611
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:38,237
[BEEP] General.
Courier plane has arrived.

612
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,267
Nice. You know what to do.

613
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,367
How much?

614
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,337
30 aircraft, probably more.

615
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,431
- Arm missiles.
- Messages entered.

616
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,370
Did he answer?

617
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,840
- Not. I just expect it.
- Jatlus.

618
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,215
- Lieutenant flight.
- I'm the captain.

619
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,417
Bring them here.

620
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,287
- What are you ...?
- Mom and sister would die

621
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,416
one by one unless you surrender
plane of the star.

622
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,483
Wow, wow, wow.

623
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,491
Give it up, there's no time
for discussion!

624
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,458
Work bagusjenderal.

625
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,291
How do I do the swap?

626
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,394
Submit yourself and your family will be released.

627
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,465
And you will be arrested.

628
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,302
Syaratku as follows ...

629
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,442
Not!

630
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,219
Not!
Fuck you!

631
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,489
Not!

632
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,348
It was his friend.

633
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:07,261
How does it feel, motherfucker?
How does it feel?

634
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,229
No.

635
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,433
Signus Alpha neutral zone.

636
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,411
Need to turn, just one ship.

637
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:29,246
There are games, we started shooting
each federation that pass us.

638
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,233
We have enough gun,
we will not need a knife collection.

639
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,398
- The gun is the weapon of cowards.
- We'll see.

640
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:55,376
Make sure the protocol is in turn the robot arms.
Supplies are limited gun.

641
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,326
DNA began to make replekasi.

642
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:23,405
Tiberius, you've become a good friend.

643
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,469
But I do not believe you.

644
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,446
Rise.

645
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,356
Tiberius?

646
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,363
- Yes, my lord.
- Throw yourself there.

647
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,295
Yes, my lord.

648
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Nice.

649
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,311
I told you, it worked.
I never doubted it.

650
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,289
I do not believe,
I set foot into this planet.

651
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,390
Legion is ready, give words.

652
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,396
The word has been given.

653
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:36,444
Each of you will bring
a platoon and assigned its own sector.

654
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,407
23:00 Saatjam we attack.

655
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,243
Stay away from the front row,
the territorial unity of the class.

656
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,381
We fought side by side with you
to each stud Teranus dead.

657
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,454
We're membuatjebakan.

658
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,460
- Where the star ship?
- It could be under us, we do not even know.

659
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,429
I do not like this.

660
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,507
We use this planet
Cornasus robot to try.

661
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,509
- It was a bold move but ...
- An attack.

662
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,492
Come on, do not remain hidden.
Where's the fun?

663
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,460
Get rid of her.

664
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,331
Come on.

665
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:42,369
How are you?
I'm embarrassed we serve in the same flag.

666
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,312
- Trenosus bastard.
- I'm not Trenosus.

667
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,440
Of course, you were.

668
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,513
A nice diversion.

669
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,480
Let's move.

670
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,294
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

671
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,309
Get down.

672
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,470
No. Not! Star Ship!

673
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,481
- Do not move at all.
- Star Ship!

674
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,382
Do not do it! Do not do it!

675
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,255
- Damn!
- Not!

676
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,450
- Come on, Whorty. Take it!
- I can not, sir!

677
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,485
Fuck you!

678
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:37,358
- No, no! Do not follow!
- I will hunt you down! I'll kill you!

679
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,271
Not! Out, Jolli!

680
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,412
- It should not do like that.
- All this is just a trap.

681
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:01,353
There's nothing we can do.

682
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,450
Wait, wait.

683
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:13,366
Aolist 14 Umbra.
Help needed at the meeting point.

684
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,237
Damn!

685
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,514
Come on, let's go.

686
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,337
- Let's kill the bastard.
- Hey, do not be too hasty.

687
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,238
Damn, the northern part.

688
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,413
Hidden inside! Move, move, move!

689
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,451
All units to the west, enable snuper cel.

690
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,261
- That whole kompani.
- Come on, go! Go, go, go!

691
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,454
- I do not like this.
- Get used.

692
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,298
- More high.
- You need help.

693
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,495
- No, I do not need.
- Ten enemy came.

694
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,238
We move away from the storm.
Prepare weapons and keys.

695
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,793
- Like this?
- You keep doing that, the system will burn.

696
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:08,507
General, we've got 20 friget, 12 bombs,
2 gravermet and 1 as a bio weapon inventory.

697
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,379
Began to bomb after us away from here.

698
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,354
General, we can not lock from this distance.

699
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,516
- Refer to the circular, do.
- Yes, sir.

700
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,521
- Wrap, shoot immediately.
- Yes, sir.

701
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,335
- 20 ready to do so.
- Not in this altitude.

702
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,397
- We're headed to the eye of the storm.
- Perfect.

703
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,431
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I'm crazy.

704
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,287
Against the wind,
Do not fight the wind.

705
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,449
- It's an idea?
- Trust me.

706
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,288
We do not do this,
not in the star ship.

707
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:58,231
- Pressure at 20 PSI.
- Stay with him.

708
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:01,336
- He's emotional, he will make mistakes.
- Yes, General.

709
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,342
- Too fast!
- Drive the storm!

You're stupid, Whorty. This is not ...

711
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,338

712
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,254
Damn!

713
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,257
We are going to explode!

714
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,261
- Faster!
- Not!

715
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,456
- We can do it!
- Up to the top, 20 degrees.

716
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,465
Eliminate driving levels!

717
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,429
All right, all right! Pull ride!

718
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,272
Pull us out of here!

719

720
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,441
Shit.

721
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:53,354
When we pull up to 28,000 rise.
Use the momentum to escape.

722
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:55,517
- Damn, Whorty.
- It's a stupid idea.

723
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,474
- It works!
- You're in luck.

724
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:26,249
- To the penyelamatanku place.
- Now a street fighter.

725
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,322
Let's do it.

726
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,278
We will not go into the silver speed immediately.

727
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,284
What are they?

728
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:59,311
Part shield generator,
we are trapped in a gravitational field!

729
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,497
All units to the palace.
Meet us at the meeting point.

730
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,329
- Do not ...
- We were attacked!

731
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,274
Let's go!

732
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,223
Okay, okay, okay.

733
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,420
Drayson, how waves of heat shield?

734
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,328
Calvin 70,000 degrees.

735
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,527
- And the federation ship?
- Maybe 3000 but the ship commander is 6.

736
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,362
- What is the distance to the missile?
- Understand, I know you're going.

737
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:25,238
- What is it?
- Six to 15,000.

738
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,242
- If we are at the end of the explosion?
- True.

739
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:28,470
- Or we will die.
- Do it.

740
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,241
- Yes, the captain.
- Yes, the captain.

741
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,247
- Tell me about the missiles.
- It's ready.

742
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,254
- Launch.
- He will not pull back.

743
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,321
No.

744
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,321
- How long?
- 30 seconds.

745
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,265
The gravity and the star.

746
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,236
Rotating, wait until the shock wave.
And dive in between them.

747
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,497
- The shock wave.
- Damn!

748
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,369
- Shield!
- Do it!

749
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,244
Not!

750
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,476
Glad to know you.

751
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,322
Drayson, turn off the power!

752
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:28,360
- Know 1.2 is ready.
- Understand.

753
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:31,237
I need a robot again
for diversion at the east gate.

754
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,433
So Diana could bring in his team.

755
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:36,309
Well, we will immediately provide it.

756
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,346
I've never been this close
with death over the years.

757
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,323
- Do you feel old?
- One day.

758
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,393
Alright. Reset manually.

759
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,491
Okay, limonal super dead.

760
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,548
Pusher switcher is gone.

761
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,328
Weapons are not active.

762
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,497
Well, the good news,
food service is still functioning.

763
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,237
So basically we are wretched.

764
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,711
- Maybe it could be worse.
- True.

765
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,347
Captain!

766
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,397

01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,292

769
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,381
What is it?

770
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,287
Diana. You're coming of the enemy.

771
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,225
Get out! Get out!

772
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,328

- They suck a lot of power.
- Gosh.

775
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:35,321
Deck 3 and 4 were damaged, need
your orders to abandon ship.

776
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,296
Reject.

777

781
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,380

Do not interfere.

- Of course.

Drayson, trash anything would be good.

785
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,533
- Restock safety assistance.
- Torgus, online.

- You must be kidding!

01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,326

- Drayson, no!
- We do not have time.

801
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:29,335
It's my fault, Joey. It's my fault.

802

805
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,278
We have to go.

806
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:46,427

waiting for my 15 minutes.

807
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,293

810
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,368
I would go to another ship
to steal the rescue boats.

811
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,464
- But ...
- Hey, you said 15 minutes, is not it?

812
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,274
It was already finished.

813
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,412

01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,289
Gosh, what if
they send a missile here?

815
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,348

he will not succeed.

- We need to get out of here!

Not if you take me to them.

829
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,500

889
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,493
System, alert.

890
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,368
Why long?

891
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:21,273
We had a problem integrating
Alien DNA delivery into modified.

892
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:25,406
DNA capable of mastering
matching the entire planet.

893
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,314
Never bound, all free.

894
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,282
Nice.

895
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,252
You know what happened? I
've been waiting for you a few hours.

896
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:33,481
Come and sit down.

897
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:41,488
I admire you.

898
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,357
But you have to listen, and listen well.

899
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,462
Overseer on the way home now.

900
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:50,438
And we must act, we
have to do something now!

901
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,372
What he found what he was looking for?

902
01:21:53,341 --> 01:22:00,474
Rimmer, did you ever suspect anything?

903
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,252
Nice.

904
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:14,394
Overseer is my half brother.

905
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:20,393
When I was 15 she got
the course with me.

906
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:26,305
He does not remember because she chose something
stupid. He does not remember anything.

907
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,266
But I'm young and I told him,

908
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:34,281
that the ambassador Thelonostra
who actually raped me.

909
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:44,449
It was that he was not forgotten, and
he will never be allowed to know.

910
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,451
Because this is my fault.

911
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:50,261
Listen to me.

912
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:56,464
Throne of right under your overseer.

913
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:59,405
It's yours.

914
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:05,504
You're raping me.
It's yours.

915
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,450
It belonged to my father.

916
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,298
Great uprising failed.

917
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:04,370
Heroes moment.

918
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,497
I am the enemy of all.

919
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:10,273
My mother and my sisters
still alive.

920
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:12,480
General only human.

921
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,409
And played me like a deck of cards.

922
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:21,286
High population of Therenostra
and federations under the overseer.

923
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,290
100 people are safe.

924
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:27,260
That's right. I'm sure your mother knows.

925
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:30,396
How bombings in Kalisto, too?

926
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,528
I hope you are
giving orders.

927
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,533
I told you ...

928
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:44,239
Give me the information.

929
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,393
So you're here to bring
exit command execution?

930
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,486
It seems you're right.

931
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:06,491
Yes.

932
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:10,337
I pull you from here.

933
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:14,240
We have a war to fight, friend.

934
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:40,300
Terenostra fallen, and
federation is not far behind.

935
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:44,496
Valley that I use.

936
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,434
Will be my curse.

937
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:49,401
And also there is hope.
