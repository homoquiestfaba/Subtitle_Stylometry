00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,529
<i>When</i>
<i>a polar bear gives birth,</i>

2
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>she typically has two cubs.</i>

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,332
<i>To keep them safe</i>
<i>from the dangers of the world,</i>

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,468
<i>she'll stay with them,</i>
<i>in the den,</i>

5
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:37,137
<i>until they can survive</i>
<i>on their own.</i>

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,139
<i>It's a sacrifice she makes.</i>

7
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,676
<i>Because if something</i>
<i>were to happen to her,</i>

8
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,612
<i>then her cubs</i>
<i>would surely die.</i>

9
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:48,382
<i>But if something</i>
<i>were to happen to her cubs,</i>

10
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,784
<i>what would become</i>
<i>of the mother?</i>

11
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,219
<i>Could she live with it?</i>

12
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,187
Ah! I can't! I can't!

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,857
- Almost there!
- I can't!

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,457
- I can see the head.
- I can't!

15
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,159
I love you, okay?
We're a team--

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,295
You can do it, baby. Come on!

17
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,396
That's it!

18
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,685
[distorted noises

19
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,604
<i>Elizabeth Aaron Bolland,</i>

20
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:53,875
<i>born at 6:36 p.m.,</i>
<i>two weeks ahead of schedule.</i>

21
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,711
<i>Six pounds, eight ounces.</i>

22
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:01,348
<i>That doesn't sound like much,</i>
<i>but to me, it's everything.</i>

23
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,919
<i>And now</i>
<i>you're my whole world.</i>

24
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,487
<i>I would do anything</i>
<i>to protect you.</i>

25
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,658
<i>My perfect baby girl.</i>

26
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:13,861
<i>I'm gonna be the kind of mother</i>
<i>for you that I never had.</i>

27
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,831
<i>You're going to have</i>
<i>a great childhood.</i>

28
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,702
<i>You have two parents</i>
<i>who love you very much.</i>

29
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:24,939
<i>When I met your father,</i>
<i>it was love at first sight.</i>

30
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,742
<i>A year later,</i>
<i>we had the perfect wedding,</i>

31
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,311
<i>and found the perfect house,</i>

32
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,816
<i>in the perfect neighborhood,</i>
<i>in the perfect town.</i>

33
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:38,920
<i>And now we have you.</i>

34
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:43,323
<i>I just didn't know</i>
<i>how exhausted I would be.</i>

35
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,674
You did it.

36
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,843
Sit down.

37
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,044
I'm gonna
get you some water, okay?

38
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,946
Actually, I just...

39
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,881
think I'm gonna
go lay down upstairs.

40
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,616
Of course.
Whatever you want.

41
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,853
-I'm sorry.
-Mm-mm. Don't be.

42
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:14,387
You go rest. Okay?
I'll take care of everything.

43
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,625
You go on.
I'll be right up.

44
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,660
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

45
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,564
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

46
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,429
<i>All I wanna do is sleep.</i>

47
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,567
<i>Life used to be brunches</i>
<i>and selfies on the beach.</i>

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,004
<i>I just need to find</i>
<i>a new normal.</i>

49
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,472
<i>A new perfect.</i>

50
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,041
<i>Right after</i>
<i>I get some sleep.</i>

51
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,557
<i>I don't know how people</i>
<i>can do this every two hours.</i>

52
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,725
Bill?

53
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,828
<i>I guess I'm lucky that</i>
<i>I don't have to do it alone.</i>

54
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,835
<i>While I spent</i>
<i>the last eight and a half months</i>

55
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:36,571
<i>suffering from mood swings,</i>
<i>bizarre cravings,</i>

56
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,806
<i>and constant discomfort,</i>

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,775
<i>Bill was nothing</i>
<i>but attentive.</i>

58
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,845
<i>I guess</i>
<i>he's earned a break.</i>

59
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:46,080
<i>From what I hear,</i>
<i>we won't get another one</i>

60
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,516
<i>until our kid grows up</i>
<i>and moves out.</i>

61
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,806
<i>I haven't taken my medicine</i>
<i>for a year,</i>

62
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,908
<i>so now I can get</i>

63
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,777
<i>a little obsessive</i>
<i>about things.</i>

64
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,680
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>who doesn't, right?</i>

65
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,049
<i>Who doesn't?</i>

66
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,619
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>it's the little things.</i>

67
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,020
You gotta be shitting me.

68
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,025
<i>I check the locks.</i>

69
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,094
<i>Sometimes a lot.</i>

70
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,697
<i>And I'm sure to close</i>
<i>every single door in the house.</i>

71
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,200
<i>Setting the TV volume</i>
<i>to an even number,</i>

72
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,970
<i>or rearranging ornaments</i>
<i>and place settings.</i>

73
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,906
<i>God, don't get me started</i>
<i>on making sure</i>

74
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,674
<i>all the photos in the house</i>
<i>are level.</i>

75
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,213
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>it's a little more than that.</i>

76
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,916
<i>Sometimes I get</i>
<i>this irrational fear</i>

77
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,017
<i>that someone is watching me.</i>

78
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,654
<i>Or stalking me.</i>

79
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,489
<i>I know</i>
<i>it's an irrational fear, but...</i>

80
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,993
<i>doesn't stop me</i>
<i>from checking everything.</i>

81
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,163
<i>I don't know what an extreme</i>
<i>case would look like for me,</i>

82
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,498
<i>but God,</i>
<i>I hope I never find out.</i>

83
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,868
<i>I haven't taken my medicine.</i>

84
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,766
<i>It's only when I know</i>
<i>that everything's perfect</i>

85
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,168
<i>that I can finally be calm.</i>

86
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,471
<i>But when is anything</i>
<i>ever perfect?</i>

87
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,241
<i>Doesn't stop me</i>
<i>from trying, though.</i>

88
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,561
<i>Everyone told me</i>
<i>that having a child</i>

89
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,895
<i>would change my life forever.</i>

90
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,965
<i>I guess I didn't realize</i>

91
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,166
<i>how much Elizabeth</i>
<i>would change mine.</i>

92
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,262
Oh...

93
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,799
<i>I just woke up</i>

94
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,068
<i>from the worst nightmare</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

95
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,237
<i>God, it felt so real.</i>

96
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,006
<i>I could hear her crying,</i>
<i>but something wasn't right.</i>

97
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,375
<i>I didn't feel</i>
<i>connected to her at all.</i>

98
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,413
<i>But I can't think</i>
<i>about that now.</i>

99
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,049
<i>Back to real life.</i>

100
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,186
<i>My cub needs her mother.</i>

101
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,288
What?

102
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,259
Nothing.
It's just, we did it.

103
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:00,895
We have a baby.

104
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,874
So, uh, did you get
some sleep last night?

105
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,110
I slept like a baby.

106
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:18,812
As in up every two hours,

107
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,416
crabby,
kinda wanting my mommy.

108
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,719
I feel like I just woke up
after a college bender.

109
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,724
Mm...

110
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:34,361
So, uh,
start your meds yet?

111
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,965
Uh, not yet.

112
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,702
I just, um-- I'm not sure,
after last time.

113
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,971
Well, the new pills
should be okay,

114
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,472
it's the, uh, blue ones.

115
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,810
They're in my purse.
I keep forgetting I have 'em.

116
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,980
Those ones
are a little different.

117
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,182
They should kick in--
in about ten to 15 minutes.

118
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,920
You know, I, uh--

119
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,956
I can withdraw
from this conference.

120
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,057
Bill, no.

121
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,925
This conference
is too important.

122
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,162
If I need anything,
I'll call Cici.

123
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,798
Okay? We're good here.

124
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,967
So you are going.

125
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,502
You sure?

126
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:17,771
Yeah.

127
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:20,941
It's only a week.

128
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,777
We won't even...

129
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,113
notice you're gone.

130
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,282
Plus I, um...

131
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,518
I was thinking about

132
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,886
doing some painting
this weekend.

133
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,988
Yeah?

134
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,889
Hmm. You inspired?

135
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,027
-I have some ideas.
-Hmm.

136
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:44,164
You, uh, been checking
the locks again.

137
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,434
Sometimes.

138
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,803
Heard you counting, too,
Adalynn.

139
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,507
Bill, I'm perfect.

140
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,877
Okay,
but if you need anything,

141
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,246
anything at all,
you call me or Cici.

142
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,149
-Or heaven forbid your mother.
-Mm.

143
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:05,886
- Things will never be that bad.
- Thank God.

144
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:09,790
Um, is that the new crib?

145
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,060
No, it's no--
hasn't arrived yet,

146
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,461
it's on back order.

147
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,197
So I pulled the old one
outta storage.

148
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,475
Oh, shit!

149
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,944
Babe,
I meant to take that off.

150
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:34,815
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,523
Babe, I'm sorry about earlier
with the crib

152
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,357
and you going
into labor, it's...

153
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,294
Just-- just slipped my mind,
like an idiot.

154
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,497
It's fine.

155
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:51,865
You just caused
a little freak-out.

156
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,168
But I got through it.

157
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,871
Do you want to talk
about it?

158
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,977
-Adalynn? Adalynn?
-Huh?

159
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,347
Oh, um...

160
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:09,149
I'm okay.

161
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,454
Spent a little quality time
with the stress ball earlier,

162
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,322
so I'm okay.

163
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,358
Really.

164
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,562
Do you wanna talk
about it?

165
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:24,965
That's my ride.

166
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,601
Okay.

167
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:28,969
-Love you.
-Love you.

168
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:30,904
Bill.

169
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,008
Don't you wanna give
your newborn daughter

170
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,343
- a kiss goodbye?
- Of course.

171
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,079
Bye.

172
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:40,648
Hey.

173
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,518
What's wrong?

174
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,555
I don't wanna
leave you alone.

175
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,291
I know.

176
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,062
But Elizabeth and I
will be okay.

177
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,298
Have a safe trip.

178
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:00,901
-Bye.
-Bye.

179
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,554
<i>And here come the waterworks.</i>

180
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,658
<i>"Baby blues"</i>
<i>is what they call it.</i>

181
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,160
<i>Add that</i>
<i>to my list of problems.</i>

182
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,530
<i>I just hope</i>
<i>this is the worst of it</i>

183
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,697
<i>and it passes soon.</i>

184
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:41,643
Hello?

185
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:08,368
What do...

186
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,347
- Hello?
<i>- Hey,</i>

187
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,683
<i>I've been calling you, girl.</i>

188
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,551
I know.

189
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:27,087
I'm sorry,
I'm just still...

190
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,291
-adjusting.
<i>-I forgive you.</i>

191
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,727
<i>And I'm so sorry</i>
<i>I didn't make it back</i>

192
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,529
<i>in time to be there.</i>

193
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:35,663
<i>You were supposed to wait</i>
<i>'til I got back.</i>

194
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,568
<i>-Hey, how was it?</i>
-Childbirth?

195
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,571
About like I expected.

196
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,475
Only 100 times
more painful.

197
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,645
<i>Hey.</i>

198
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:54,147
<i>You know, my hormones were</i>
<i>really outta control, remember?</i>

199
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,818
<i>And I could not have gotten</i>
<i>through that without you.</i>

200
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:58,252
<i>And I'm here for you, too.</i>

201
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,593
-Thank you.
<i>-Okay.</i>

202
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:08,362
<i>Well, sweetie,</i>
<i>what are you doing today?</i>

203
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,831
<i>I was thinking that</i>
<i>we could get takeout</i>

204
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:11,833
<i>from Croso's</i>
<i>and catch up.</i>

205
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,801
<i>I'm dying to meet the baby.</i>

206
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,537
Oh, um,

207
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,105
we're not really up
for visitors just yet.

208
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:23,611
<i>-You sure you're okay?</i>
-Yeah.

209
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,814
I'm fine.
Uh, everything's perfect.

210
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,651
<i>Well, i-- if you're not,</i>
<i>there's no shame in it.</i>

211
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:33,320
<i>I mean, nobody's really</i>
<i>perfect, you know?</i>

212
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,456
We'll be fine.

213
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,427
As long as we can survive
until Bill gets home,

214
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,865
-everything will be perfect.
<i>-Survive?</i>

215
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:45,667
<i>Hey, Adalynn,</i>
<i>what do you mean?</i>

216
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,770
I have to go
pump now, Cici.

217
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,838
Thank you for calling.

218
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:19,299
"Nobody's really
perfect, you know?"

219
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,401
Who does she think she is?

220
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,189
Ow.

221
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:14,421
<i>I am aching for a nap.</i>

222
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,391
<i>That sure would be easier</i>
<i>with Bill around.</i>

223
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,494
<i>But his career is riding</i>
<i>on this conference.</i>

224
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,868
<i>It's not his fault</i>
<i>Elizabeth came early.</i>

225
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,642
Oh, Bill,
what did you do?

226
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:35,910
<i>Bill told me</i>
<i>he'd ordered some things</i>

227
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,745
<i>for the baby,</i>

228
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,814
<i>but he didn't tell me</i>
<i>he went overboard.</i>

229
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,684
<i>My sweet husband told me</i>
<i>to put all the packages aside</i>

230
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,585
<i>and that he'd deal with them</i>
<i>when he gets home.</i>

231
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>I am so tired</i>

232
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:02,335
<i>and this baby</i>
<i>won't shut up!</i>

233
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,339
<i>God, shut up.</i>

234
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,976
<i>Shut up, shut up,</i>
<i>shut up, shut up, shut up!</i>

235
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,807
<i>I could use something</i>
<i>to take the edge off.</i>

236
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,476
<i>A glass of wine,</i>
<i>maybe two.</i>

237
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,612
<i>Hell, why not the whole</i>
<i>fucking bottle?</i>

238
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,515
<i>But I won't.</i>

239
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,551
<i>I won't contaminate my milk.</i>

240
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,553
<i>No meds and no wine.</i>

241
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:43,370
<i>I guess I just need to find</i>
<i>other ways to relax</i>

242
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,906
<i>and feel like my old self.</i>

243
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,440
<i>However briefly.</i>

244
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,409
<i>I still have painting,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

245
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,605
<i>As obsessed</i>
<i>as I can be with even numbers,</i>

246
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:20,473
<i>locked doors,</i>
<i>and symmetrical designs,</i>

247
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,677
<i>painting</i>
<i>is the only outlet I have</i>

248
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,512
<i>to break all my own rules.</i>

249
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:32,485
<i>I can be free</i>

250
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,856
<i>and express myself in ways</i>
<i>that I can't otherwise.</i>

251
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:35,990
<i>Not even while journaling.</i>

252
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,993
<i>It's my true therapy.</i>

253
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,510
<i>I can create a world</i>
<i>where things can be perfect,</i>

254
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,478
<i>just as they should be.</i>

255
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:00,915
<i>Perfection may be out of reach</i>
<i>in my daily life,</i>

256
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,984
<i>but not for my subjects.</i>

257
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,155
<i>It scares me sometimes</i>

258
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,157
<i>how easily I can get lost</i>
<i>in my own fantasy.</i>

259
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,460
<i>I get so lost sometimes</i>

260
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,630
<i>that I fear</i>
<i>I'll never find my way back.</i>

261
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:17,832
<i>Sometimes.</i>

262
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,935
It's fine, Adalynn.
It's just in your head.

263
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:41,208
It's just you. Nobody's here.
Nobody's here.

264
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:27,788
<i>God,</i>
<i>none of this feels normal.</i>

265
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,191
<i>Why aren't we bonding?</i>

266
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:34,829
<i>What's wrong with you, Adalynn?</i>

267
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,631
<i>She's just a baby.</i>

268
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:41,102
<i>Come on, you can do it.</i>
<i>Just fall asleep, Elizabeth.</i>

269
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,738
<i>I can't take</i>
<i>any more crying.</i>

270
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:47,708
<i>It's been over</i>
<i>an hour now.</i>

271
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,177
<i>Please,</i>
<i>just go to bed for Mama.</i>

272
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,279
<i>Just go to bed.</i>

273
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:56,083
<i>I wonder if other new mothers</i>
<i>feel like this.</i>

274
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:59,720
<i>I just can't take</i>
<i>the screaming anymore.</i>

275
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,862
<i>Please, please tell me</i>
<i>this is gonna end one day.</i>

276
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:09,663
<i>It can't always</i>
<i>be like this.</i>

277
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:13,134
How's my little angel?

278
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,337
<i>Fussy as hell, so is the baby.</i>

279
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,638
<i>How's the conference?</i>

280
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:19,974
It's a little
overwhelming, to be honest.

281
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,744
I never have an issue speaking
in front of large crowds.

282
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:27,281
I mean, even I get, you know,
stage fright sometimes.

283
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:30,117
<i>Apparently so.</i>

284
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,219
<i>So, uh, you doing okay?</i>

285
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,355
Yes, Bill, I'm fine.

286
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:35,656
I'm a tough...

287
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:39,660
-girl.
<i>-I know you are.</i>

288
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,430
<i>Oh, you know, uh--</i>
<i>you won't believe this.</i>

289
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:44,765
<i>Walter Fishman is</i>

290
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:46,167
finally retiring.

291
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,002
- <i>What? Why now?</i>
- Yeah.

292
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,803
<i>I mean, he's only 100.</i>

293
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,339
He's probably got what,
50 more good years in him?

294
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,808
<i>He's 75, Adalynn.</i>
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

295
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,411
Don't you ever let me go
that long, you promise?

296
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,847
I promise. 70 tops.

297
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,050
Ugh, that's the doorbell.

298
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,752
Probably more
of your impulse buys.

299
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,320
<i>Probably.</i>

300
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,755
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>when the pack and play comes,</i>

301
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:09,223
<i>just let it-- set it aside.</i>

302
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,925
I'll handle it when I get home.
All right?

303
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,726
We'll see,
I have a list of other things

304
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,195
for you to do first.

305
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,095
- I love you.
<i>- I love you.</i>

306
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,985
Shh! Shh!

307
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:12,987
Shh.

308
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:19,760
Oh, my God.

309
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:09,143
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

310
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,411
<i>Sometimes nothing works.</i>

311
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,989
<i>And when the pain</i>
<i>doesn't go away,</i>

312
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,192
<i>I feel helpless.</i>

313
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:03,497
<i>Like I'm all out of options.</i>

314
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:15,677
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>it's more than just my brain.</i>

315
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,046
<i>The headaches are back</i>
<i>and something else seems off.</i>

316
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,383
<i>This really is a lot for me.</i>

317
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,152
<i>I feel like I'm heading</i>
<i>into a downward spiral.</i>

318
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:27,689
<i>Meanwhile, Bill's probably</i>
<i>rubbing elbows with millionaires</i>

319
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,289
<i>over champagne and caviar.</i>

320
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:34,995
<i>Okay, that's not fair.</i>
<i>He did offer to stay.</i>

321
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,599
<i>He really wanted to.</i>

322
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,033
<i>I could see it in his eyes</i>
<i>when he left.</i>

323
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:43,638
<i>His concern.</i>
<i>And sadness, perhaps.</i>

324
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,509
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>I pushed him to go.</i>

325
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:51,178
<i>Maybe I needed to prove to him</i>
<i>that I could handle this.</i>

326
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:52,714
<i>Maybe I needed</i>
<i>to prove to myself</i>

327
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,081
<i>that I could handle this.</i>

328
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:58,051
"'Anything could be in there,'
said the playful puffin.

329
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:01,054
'It could be a slippery fish,
or a wisecracking walrus,

330
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,123
or even
a water-wading whale.'

331
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,227
The happy little harp seal

332
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,597
pulled himself closer to the ice
for a better look.

333
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,966
'If I could use a last wish
for anything,

334
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,335
anything in the world,'
said the pup.

335
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,672
'I know exactly
who I would wish to--'"

336
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,153
Come on.

337
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,155
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

338
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:36,691
Come on.

339
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:42,196
Breathe. Come on.

340
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:11,526
Now, try to relax.

341
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,374
A little higher than normal,
but nothing too bad.

342
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,111
Is this really necessary?

343
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,547
I-- I only called
about the baby.

344
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:36,049
This is true.
But the baby's fine.

345
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:39,386
And true fact,
the well-being of a baby

346
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,523
often depends
on the well-being of its mother.

347
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,525
Right,
but are you sure, though?

348
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:44,592
About the choking?

349
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,761
Oh, yes.
It's very common.

350
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:50,230
Um, infants are born
with a hyper gag reflex.

351
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:53,768
Um, when it happens,
just let it pass.

352
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:56,203
Um, adjust
the baby's position,

353
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:59,072
maybe your own,
and resume feeding.

354
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:02,309
Yeah, I-- I knew that,
I just, um...

355
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:04,612
I just forgot.

356
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:06,413
Uh...

357
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,818
It just--
it all happened so fast,

358
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:13,153
you know, like,
in that instant, it all--

359
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:14,254
it all could've just--

360
00:34:16,591 --> 00:34:18,560
I'm sorry,
you probably think I'm crazy.

361
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,663
I could tell you stories
about what lengths

362
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:24,097
I've seen mothers go to
to protect their young.

363
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:26,568
It happens in nature,
you know.

364
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:30,805
Um, polar bears,
for example.

365
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:34,207
The moms
usually have two cubs

366
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,343
and they'd sacrifice anything
to keep 'em alive.

367
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,516
So, how are you feeling?

368
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,483
Are-- are you getting
enough sleep?

369
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:46,854
- I mean, does any parent?
- Touché.

370
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,727
Are you eating,
exercising, meditating?

371
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,096
Uh, I did start writing
in my journal again.

372
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:57,799
It helps.

373
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:58,900
I think.

374
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:00,602
Good, good.

375
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:03,571
And you're staying off
the prescriptions?

376
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,276
Uh, yeah. Yes.
I-- I haven't taken any.

377
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,378
Um, I don-- I don't want to.

378
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:14,348
You know, a-- after last time.

379
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:19,687
Adalynn, that was a completely
different situation.

380
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:21,789
Yeah.

381
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:23,791
Because I aborted him.

382
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,862
It wasn't your fault.
The-- the-- the-- the fetus--

383
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,364
It's Miles.
His name was Miles.

384
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:36,571
Miles had
severe cardiac abnormalities.

385
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,674
It was no longer
a viable pregnancy.

386
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,543
You know, we--
we took the best option.

387
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,277
It wasn't your fault.

388
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:48,916
I know. I know.

389
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:51,819
I'm sorry, I just...

390
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:54,789
I think about it...

391
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,191
a lot.

392
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,596
Everything was so perfect.

393
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:05,399
I don't understand.

394
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,237
Why him?

395
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,908
Was it the meds?

396
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:15,877
Was it me?

397
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,613
Was it something
that I did?

398
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:21,716
There wasn't anything
that anyone could have done.

399
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,422
He, uh...

400
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:32,459
he would've been due
six years ago last week.

401
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,196
He would've been six.

402
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,637
I sometimes wonder wha--
what my life would've been like

403
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,771
if he would've lived.

404
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,240
I think about it every day.

405
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,614
You shouldn't do that
to yourself.

406
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:55,983
Besides,
if he'd lived,

407
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:59,219
who knows how
it would've affected your life?

408
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,322
You could have missed out on

409
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:04,959
this beautiful bundle of joy
right here.

410
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,632
Sure, but...

411
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,235
it's not all
I think about.

412
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:20,007
I also wonder what my life
would've been like...

413
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,710
without either of them.

414
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,346
And then I get to thinking,

415
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,316
"Did I will that to happen?"

416
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,953
No. Ab-- absolutely not.

417
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,286
What if I did?

418
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,492
Stop!
You loved your baby.

419
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:39,727
Miles.

420
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:42,295
You love
both your children.

421
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,600
Uh, you're just having
an episode.

422
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:50,972
It is just so much harder
without the pills.

423
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:52,907
You know, I--

424
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,543
I wish I could just take one.

425
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:59,412
At least just one, Doctor.

426
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:02,650
That-- that's not in your best
interest right now.

427
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:03,718
All right?

428
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:08,388
I know it's hard,
but this will pass.

429
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:12,292
I'm just so afraid
that something might happen.

430
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:16,597
- Like what?
- I don't know.

431
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,600
Sometimes things just happen,
you know?

432
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:25,039
Or--
or what if I do something?

433
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,645
Are you afraid you may harm
yourself or your baby?

434
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:34,081
No. No, no.

435
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,786
Have you been seeing things?

436
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,527
You would tell me, right?

437
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:48,729
Yes, yeah.

438
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:53,400
Yes, of course, Doctor.
I just wondered, is all.

439
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,368
Okay.

440
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,708
Well, remember that
there's a after-hours number

441
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,777
you can call,
uh, if you need to.

442
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:06,479
And in the meantime,
I can assure you

443
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,516
that your baby
is in perfect health.

444
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,787
And you have nothing to fear
but fear itself.

445
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,102
Drink the whole bottle
for Mommy

446
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:29,904
without scaring her
half to death, all right?

447
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,974
No more scares for Mommy.

448
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:09,710
Oh, no.
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. Oh, no.

449
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:09,837
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I'm starting to unravel.</i>

450
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:14,108
<i>I'm seeing things.</i>
<i>The worst things.</i>

451
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:17,712
<i>I've read about this,</i>
<i>it's not uncommon.</i>

452
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:20,748
<i>God, I wish I had someone</i>
<i>to talk to about this.</i>

453
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:22,950
<i>But if I can just make it</i>
<i>a few more days,</i>

454
00:41:22,984 --> 00:41:24,719
<i>Bill will be home</i>

455
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:26,587
<i>and we can deal with this</i>
<i>together.</i>

456
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,889
<i>Just hold on, Adalynn.</i>
<i>We can get through this.</i>

457
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:31,692
<i>Just a little bit longer.</i>

458
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,180
One, two, three,

459
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,315
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

460
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,869
Fucking toy!

461
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:02,443
<i>It was</i>
<i>probably just a nightmare, babe.</i>

462
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:04,845
It wasn't a nightmare, Bill.

463
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:08,182
I'm just saying
it's 3:30 in the morning.

464
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,084
Di-- Somebody was trying
to break into our house,

465
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:11,986
it happened.

466
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,320
Otherwise, how do you explain
the broken wine glass?

467
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:15,156
<i>I didn't dream that.</i>

468
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:18,058
-I don't know.
<i>-I'm calling the police.</i>

469
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:20,094
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

470
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:21,829
Let's just take a minute,
all right?

471
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,063
Let's think about this.

472
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:24,765
There has to be--

473
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:26,400
has to be
a logical explanation, right?

474
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,402
<i>You said</i>
<i>the doors were unlocked.</i>

475
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,204
Yes. And it was opened.

476
00:44:30,237 --> 00:44:31,739
And no one entered
the house, right?

477
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:34,041
No.
I mean, I don't think so.

478
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:35,276
But I heard--

479
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,444
I-- I thought I heard--

480
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,848
Adalynn?

481
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,485
I didn't see anyo--
anybody come in, but--

482
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,987
<i>-they could have.</i>
-How?

483
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:48,255
<i>What?</i>

484
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,990
What difference
does that make?

485
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:53,260
You're checking locks again.

486
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:55,162
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you checked before that?</i>

487
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:56,263
I don't know.

488
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:57,965
<i>1:00, 1:30, why?</i>

489
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,300
And were they locked?

490
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:03,904
<i>-And they were locked?</i>
-Yes.

491
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,974
Exactly.

492
00:45:11,312 --> 00:45:12,379
You're saying

493
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,315
they were locked.

494
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,917
How could they be unlocked?

495
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:18,352
<i>They couldn't be, right?</i>

496
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:23,991
<i>Adalynn?</i>

497
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:24,925
Maybe they picked the locks
or something.

498
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,460
I don't know.

499
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:27,995
<i>And what about</i>
<i>the animals downstairs?</i>

500
00:45:28,963 --> 00:45:30,397
What animals, Adalynn?

501
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:32,066
The-- the--
the ceramic animals, Bill.

502
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,168
The-- the-- the penguins,
the polar bears.

503
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,070
They were all mixed up
and facing different ways.

504
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,339
<i>And I thought</i>
<i>maybe I imagined it, but--</i>

505
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:40,908
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

506
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:43,110
Hold on. You imagined it?

507
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,079
<i>After tonight--</i>

508
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,981
<i>Somebody has been</i>
<i>in our house, Bill.</i>

509
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,385
Look, I saw what I saw.
Okay?

510
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,220
<i>Why don't you believe me?</i>

511
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:55,456
Listen, I do believe you.

512
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,291
I believe you heard something,
but I don't believe--

513
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:58,959
<i>That is not what I meant.</i>

514
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,097
<i>Listen, I'm coming home.</i>

515
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,032
<i>All right?</i>
<i>I'll come home.</i>

516
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,969
<i>-I'll catch the next flight out.</i>
-Bill.

517
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:10,170
No.

518
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:13,474
Well, then tell me,

519
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,310
what the fuck am I supposed
to do, Adalynn?

520
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:18,245
<i>Please, please.</i>
<i>I'm out-- I'm outta answers.</i>

521
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:20,881
You have to finish.

522
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:23,450
I'm sorry.

523
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:27,054
Just haven't gotten
any sleep and--

524
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:29,089
<i>I just-- I guess</i>
<i>I'm just preaching to the choir.</i>

525
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,826
Okay, listen.

526
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:35,095
I'm gonna call security.

527
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:36,897
I'm gonna have him come by,
check on things.

528
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,566
If anything else happens,

529
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,933
<i>you call the police.</i>

530
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:43,137
Yeah.

531
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,508
Okay. Sure.

532
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,009
Okay. Good.

533
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:53,847
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

534
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:57,951
Good. Yeah.
Get some rest.

535
00:46:58,586 --> 00:47:01,155
Oh, and please take your pills
if you haven't yet.

536
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:04,391
All right?

537
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:07,194
<i>-I love you.</i>
-I love you, too.

538
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,109
Hello?

539
00:47:55,142 --> 00:47:57,144
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

540
00:47:57,177 --> 00:47:59,947
<i>I just got off the phone</i>
<i>with, uh, the security office.</i>

541
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,148
What'd they say?

542
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,416
<i>They didn't find anything.</i>

543
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,688
<i>The manager said there were</i>
<i>some new kids in the complex.</i>

544
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,455
<i>They were probably</i>
<i>just screwing around.</i>

545
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:11,258
Screwing around?

546
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,961
<i>They're gonna do extra patrol</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

547
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:15,697
<i>That was the best</i>
<i>they can do.</i>

548
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,632
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>didn't have any better news.</i>

549
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,568
Whatever, Bill.

550
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,639
I'll call you later.
Love you.

551
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:27,174
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I'm losing my mind.</i>

552
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:29,176
<i>I'm starting to lose grip</i>
<i>on reality.</i>

553
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,011
<i>God, maybe Bill was right.</i>

554
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:32,647
<i>Maybe this is all in my head</i>

555
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,047
<i>and I should just</i>
<i>get back on the meds.</i>

556
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:38,318
<i>But I can't. Not yet.</i>

557
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:40,954
<i>If I do I-- I don't know</i>
<i>what they'll do to me.</i>

558
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,439
Please, no...

559
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:23,343
<i>Wait, wait, go back.</i>

560
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:24,779
<i>The gun safe was open?</i>

561
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:29,817
I must have left it unlocked
when I opened it the other day.

562
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:31,853
- Opened for what?
<i>- I just...</i>

563
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,889
wanted to see it.

564
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:37,324
You know, make sure
it was there, in case--

565
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,760
<i>Damn it, Adalynn.</i>

566
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:40,494
Thank God--
thank God you're okay.

567
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,496
But, I mean, did you at least
call the police?

568
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,665
<i>Yeah, they're on their way.</i>

569
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:47,735
Okay. That's good.

570
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:49,737
- <i>You sorry?</i>
- What?

571
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,606
Are you sorry
that you didn't believe me?

572
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:59,647
I never said
I didn't believe you.

573
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:02,382
<i>I'll see</i>
<i>if I can catch a red-eye.</i>

574
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:05,452
No, Bill,
you're almost done.

575
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:07,855
Everything's perfect.

576
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:11,592
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- Yes, I'm sure.

577
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:15,863
Okay. Well, I'm gonna call
that security office.

578
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:18,633
I'm gonna rip them
a fucking new one.

579
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,802
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>I want you to call the maid</i>

580
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:22,937
<i>and-- and see</i>
<i>if she can make a special trip.</i>

581
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,540
I gave her the week off.

582
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:26,406
<i>Her daughter</i>
<i>has the flu, remember?</i>

583
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,675
Oh, shit!

584
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,545
That's right.
Okay. How about this?

585
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:32,479
Go ahead and call my mom
and she'll stay with you

586
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,749
- 'til I get back, all right?
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

587
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:36,784
I said I'm fine. Okay?

588
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,787
<i>Adalynn...</i>

589
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:42,890
I'm perfectly capable
of handling this by myself.

590
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:44,892
<i>I know how</i>
<i>to take care of my baby.</i>

591
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:46,326
Our baby.

592
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:48,328
I'm gonna finish cleaning.

593
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,464
Maybe give the baby a bath.

594
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,567
-I'll see you Sunday.
-No, Adalynn.

595
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,801
Adalynn, stay on the phone.
Adalynn?

596
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,388
Bill, I said
I don't wanna talk right--

597
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,959
Hello?

598
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:19,927
<i>You're all gonna die.</i>

599
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:36,711
Look, I'll put in the report,

600
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:39,379
but without a description
and no forced entry,

601
00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:41,414
there's not a whole lot
we can do right now.

602
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,950
Okay, but what about
the phone calls?

603
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:45,052
-We'll run the number.
-So that's it?

604
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:48,288
I'm sorry. I-- I wish
there was more we could do.

605
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,925
Look,
if you can think of anything,

606
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,593
give us a call, okay?

607
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:08,009
<i>The best thing</i>
<i>about picking up the pieces</i>

608
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,944
<i>after completely falling apart</i>

609
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,747
<i>is that it gives you</i>
<i>a sense of control again.</i>

610
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,916
<i>You can rebuild things</i>
<i>however you want them.</i>

611
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:19,486
<i>I spent the last few days</i>
<i>losing my shit,</i>

612
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,023
<i>but I knew</i>
<i>I couldn't stay there.</i>

613
00:55:22,056 --> 00:55:23,758
<i>And look,</i>

614
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,827
<i>this terrible thing</i>
<i>that happened,</i>

615
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,896
<i>I survived it,</i>
<i>and I will continue to.</i>

616
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,465
<i>I have to keep it together</i>
<i>for my family.</i>

617
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,969
<i>So, we're starting over.</i>

618
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,538
<i>Everything can feel like</i>
<i>new again.</i>

619
00:55:37,572 --> 00:55:39,807
<i>Good. Great, even.</i>

620
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:42,009
<i>In a word,</i>
<i>well, you know...</i>

621
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:44,612
<i>perfect.</i>

622
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:48,015
<i>Except...</i>

623
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:49,416
<i>it's not perfect,</i>
<i>is it?</i>

624
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:55,089
<i>You can never put things</i>
<i>back together like they were.</i>

625
00:55:57,124 --> 00:56:00,393
<i>And it can happen again.</i>

626
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:02,930
<i>I can't keep this up forever.</i>

627
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:04,899
<i>I know</i>
<i>I'm not fooling anybody.</i>

628
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:07,668
<i>I'm losing it.</i>

629
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:26,787
<i>Kill them all!</i>

630
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,961
<i>Do it.</i>

631
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:10,031
I'm sorry.

632
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,170
I have to.

633
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:32,653
No!

634
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,023
No.

635
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,862
No! No, no!

636
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:45,166
No!

637
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:49,136
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

638
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,193
You can't have us.

639
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:04,705
<i>Cici.</i>

640
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:07,808
Shit! No!

641
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:15,983
It's okay. It's okay.

642
01:00:16,016 --> 01:00:21,822
One, two, three,
four, five...

643
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:33,868
One, two, three,
four, five...

644
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,244
<i>Mommy!</i>

645
01:00:45,246 --> 01:00:47,381
<i>Wake up, Mommy. Wake up.</i>

646
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:06,867
Who's there?

647
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:08,903
Huh?

648
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:19,480
- How'd you get into my house?
<i>- Silly, Mommy.</i>

649
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:22,750
<i>Stop playing.</i>
<i>Come cuddle with me.</i>

650
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:37,965
Miles?

651
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:49,376
Hello?

652
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:08,195
You're not my son.

653
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:11,098
Miles, he...

654
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:14,034
...he wasn't born.

655
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:17,438
<i>And yet, here I am.</i>

656
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:20,207
No.

657
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,409
We lost you.

658
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:24,411
<i>You didn't lose me, Mommy.</i>

659
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:31,919
<i>I wasn't perfect,</i>
<i>so you killed me.</i>

660
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,487
- No!
<i>- Remember?</i>

661
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:35,422
No!

662
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:37,091
<i>Just like</i>
<i>you killed all your family.</i>

663
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:49,937
<i>The pills?</i>

664
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:53,474
<i>These are the new ones.</i>

665
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:56,277
<i>They were in my purse.</i>

666
01:02:57,878 --> 01:02:59,179
<i>But I-- I moved them,</i>
<i>didn't I?</i>

667
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:06,521
Sorry I couldn't save you.

668
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,459
<i>They should kick in</i>
<i>in about ten to 15 minutes.</i>

669
01:03:46,427 --> 01:03:47,494
No, you're not...

670
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:49,564
You're all right.

671
01:03:50,197 --> 01:03:51,265
You're fine.

672
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:03,877
It's okay.

673
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,385
Elizabeth.

674
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:38,238
<i>It worked.</i>

675
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:40,508
<i>We made it, my love.</i>

676
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:53,353
Ready to see the world,
sunshine?

677
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,227
Bill!

678
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:49,537
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.

679
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:51,171
Put the gun down, babe.

680
01:07:52,472 --> 01:07:53,808
Bill?

681
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:55,342
Put the gun down.
Come here.

682
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:58,846
What happened here, Adalynn?
Adalynn, let go.

683
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:01,783
-What happened?
-What?

684
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:04,284
Adalynn,
what did you do?

685
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:11,358
No. No, I--
It wa-- it wasn't like this.

686
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,594
-I-- I-- I cleaned.
-What the fuck!

687
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:13,861
-Have you been drinking?
-No, no.

688
01:08:13,895 --> 01:08:15,563
It was the break-in, Bill.

689
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:17,799
-It wa--
-Look at this shit.

690
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:19,834
Baby powder
fucking everywhere.

691
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,736
Where--
What's Elizabeth eating, huh?

692
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:24,806
Look at me. Look at me.

693
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,441
You're not even taking
your pills, are you?

694
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:28,643
-No.
-What?

695
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:31,411
The-- the doctor
told me not to, Bill.

696
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,313
What are you talking about,
Adalynn?

697
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,282
The doctor, he came
to check on Elizabeth

698
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,484
and he told me not to so that
I wouldn't hurt her.

699
01:08:37,518 --> 01:08:39,386
Adalynn,
I am your doctor.

700
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,589
You fucking insisted on it.

701
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:43,858
What the fuck is this shit!

702
01:08:43,891 --> 01:08:46,694
It's a fucking mess.

703
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:49,262
Fuck.

704
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:51,365
Fuck.

705
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,535
Adalynn, you knew--

706
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:57,237
you knew having the baby
would exacerbate your condition.

707
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,338
You knew this.

708
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,943
Look at me.
You're dehydrated.

709
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:03,878
- When was the last time you ate?
- Stop. Stop!

710
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,613
When was the last time
you had water besides this--

711
01:09:05,647 --> 01:09:07,548
I don't know.
I don't know!

712
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:10,450
You promised you'd tell me.

713
01:09:11,019 --> 01:09:13,420
You promised me and Elizabeth.

714
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,389
-You promised us.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

715
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:18,893
It's okay.
It's okay. I'm sorry.

716
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:21,562
It's okay. It's okay.

717
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,431
Where's Elizabeth,
Ad-- Adalynn?

718
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,333
-What?
-Our kid?

719
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:27,935
-Where's our kid at?
-No, no, no, no.

720
01:09:27,969 --> 01:09:29,804
-Bill. Bill, please come here.
-Stop it!

721
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,673
- Come here, please. It's fine.
- Stop it!

722
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:39,814
Don't go in there.

723
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,722
- Oh, no!
- No!

724
01:09:47,755 --> 01:09:48,956
Oh, God, no.

725
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:52,560
No, not our baby.

726
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:05,338
-No.
-I'm sorry.

727
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,507
No!

728
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:15,282
<i>Another delusion.</i>
<i>And the worst one yet.</i>

729
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:17,417
<i>I went right over the edge.</i>

730
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,020
<i>When thoughts</i>
<i>of harming my daughter evolved</i>

731
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:21,288
<i>to harming myself,</i>

732
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:23,891
<i>I realized that losing her</i>
<i>and Miles would be too much.</i>

733
01:10:24,926 --> 01:10:26,928
<i>I couldn't bear that.</i>

734
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:29,296
<i>But I think it's over.</i>

735
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:31,833
<i>I think the pill--</i>

736
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,668
<i>I hope it worked.</i>

737
01:10:37,772 --> 01:10:41,509
<i>I guess I never really</i>
<i>dealt with my grief before.</i>

738
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:43,410
<i>I didn't know how.</i>

739
01:10:43,443 --> 01:10:45,713
<i>It just became easier</i>
<i>for me to take pills,</i>

740
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:50,818
<i>fixate on obsessive behaviors,</i>
<i>and let reality fade away.</i>

741
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:54,254
<i>But I think I can finally</i>
<i>just let things be.</i>

742
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:57,290
"Oh, colored leaves
are on the ground."

743
01:10:57,324 --> 01:11:00,528
<i>I see now how</i>
<i>unsustainable perfection</i> is.

744
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:02,429
<i>I was never perfect.</i>

745
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:04,464
<i>There's no such thing.</i>

746
01:11:04,498 --> 01:11:06,299
<i>There's just life.</i>

747
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:09,336
<i>And when living it,</i>
<i>shit happens sometimes.</i>

748
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:11,539
<i>Whether pointless and mundane,</i>

749
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:13,841
<i>or in a way that's cruel</i>
<i>and earth-shattering.</i>

750
01:11:17,344 --> 01:11:19,580
<i>And when you're dealt</i>
<i>a hand like that,</i>

751
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:21,749
<i>I think</i>
<i>you're left with a choice.</i>

752
01:11:21,783 --> 01:11:24,051
<i>You can find a way</i>
<i>to live with it,</i>

753
01:11:24,085 --> 01:11:26,453
<i>or you can let it</i>
<i>destroy you.</i>

754
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:30,490
<i>Rather, you can destroy yourself</i>
<i>and everything about you.</i>

755
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,727
<i>Everything in your life.</i>

756
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:43,070
<i>It sounds like an easy choice,</i>
<i>but sometimes it's not.</i>

757
01:11:43,104 --> 01:11:46,406
<i>I, like many others,</i>
<i>couldn't trust my brain</i>

758
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:47,508
<i>to tell me the truth.</i>

759
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:50,443
<i>And what's worse...</i>

760
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:53,346
<i>I couldn't tell anyone</i>
<i>what I was going through.</i>

761
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,415
<i>What would people say,</i>

762
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:58,519
<i>if I told them</i>
<i>what I saw and felt?</i>

763
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:01,354
<i>They'd say I was crazy.</i>

764
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:04,357
<i>They'd call me a monster.</i>

765
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:05,927
<i>Maybe they'd even try</i>
<i>and take Elizabeth.</i>

766
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:09,063
<i>But I'm not a monster.</i>

767
01:12:09,096 --> 01:12:11,732
<i>I'm a mother,</i>
<i>like so many others,</i>

768
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:14,068
<i>who went through</i>
<i>some serious postpartum shit</i>

769
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,070
<i>and can't even talk about it.</i>

770
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:18,539
<i>We keep our mouths shut</i>
<i>to avoid judgment.</i>

771
01:12:18,573 --> 01:12:20,842
<i>So we won't be labeled unfit.</i>

772
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:24,679
<i>We ignore our own health</i>
<i>to keep this deadly secret.</i>

773
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:27,582
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>people need help, too.</i>

774
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:29,617
<i>And, God, do I wish</i>

775
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,853
<i>it was easier to ask for.</i>

776
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:33,486
<i>Talk about a perfect world.</i>

777
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:34,922
Hey, girl.

778
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,858
<i>But we have to try.</i>

779
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:40,493
<i>We have to open up</i>
<i>to the people who care about us.</i>

780
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:42,997
<i>And try and make the best</i>
<i>of the world that we live in.</i>

781
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,903
<i>We find ways to cope.</i>

782
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:50,972
<i>We take it day by day.</i>

783
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:54,407
<i>And in time, we improve.</i>

784
01:12:54,441 --> 01:12:57,745
<i>We heal, and we live on</i>
<i>to fight another day.</i>

785
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:00,815
<i>We do it for our cubs,</i>

786
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:02,650
<i>like the great mother</i>
<i>polar bear.</i>

787
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:05,820
<i>So, I'll paint.</i>

788
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:08,689
<i>I'll leave all my pain</i>
<i>and my anger</i>

789
01:13:08,723 --> 01:13:11,491
<i>and my broken heart</i>
<i>on the canvas.</i>

790
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:15,029
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>with every cathartic stroke</i>

791
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:17,031
<i>and every drop</i>
<i>of pigment squeezed</i>

792
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:20,001
<i>out of my very soul,</i>
<i>I'm set free.</i>

793
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:23,971
<i>Does that mean I'm cured?</i>

794
01:13:24,005 --> 01:13:26,173
<i>No. I'm just...</i>

795
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,876
<i>managing.</i>

796
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:31,879
<i>I'm getting by,</i>
<i>maybe even improving a little.</i>

797
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:35,716
<i>I mean, Bill's prescriptions</i>
<i>help, too, obviously.</i>

798
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,019
<i>I read that</i>
<i>they don't work for everyone.</i>

799
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:39,620
<i>But Bill was right.</i>

800
01:13:39,654 --> 01:13:41,222
<i>After 15 minutes,</i>

801
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:42,757
<i>these little blue pills</i>
<i>gave me something</i>

802
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:45,226
<i>I haven't had for weeks.</i>

803
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:46,961
<i>Maybe not since we lost Miles.</i>

804
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:49,429
<i>They gave me hope.</i>

805
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:14,555
<i>And hope is just what I needed</i>
<i>to save my family...</i>

806
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:18,826
<i>and save my life.</i>

807
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:26,834
Adalynn, I'm home.

808
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:29,737
Found this on the porch.

809
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:32,940
I just ordered this.

810
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:37,044
Oh.

811
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,147
Hi.

812
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:45,186
Adalynn.

813
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,687
And Elizabeth.

814
01:14:47,455 --> 01:14:50,057
I was so worried, so worried.

815
01:14:51,258 --> 01:14:52,560
I'm so sorry.

816
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:55,730
-It's okay.
-You okay?

817
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:57,231
I'm per--

818
01:14:58,065 --> 01:14:59,133
I'm good.

819
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:02,903
Hi.

820
01:15:06,574 --> 01:15:08,309
<i>Daddy!</i>

821
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:22,757
- This isn't right.
<i>- Daddy!</i>

822
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:23,858
No!

823
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,261
This isn't right.

824
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,568
This isn't right.
This isn't right.

825
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:41,208
<i>Mommy!</i>

826
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:49,350
This isn't right.
This isn't right.

827
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:52,586
<i>What's the matter, Mommy?</i>

828
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:56,757
Adalynn. Adalynn.

829
01:16:04,065 --> 01:16:05,132
You're okay.

830
01:16:05,499 --> 01:16:06,934
You're having another episode.

831
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:10,871
Focus on my voice
and do your counting.

832
01:16:12,073 --> 01:16:14,075
No, this isn't right.

833
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:16,977
- Adalynn.
- You're not real.

834
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:18,813
None of this is real.

835
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:20,848
Leave us alone.

836
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,787
I'm afraid
this is worse than I thought.

837
01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:31,992
Remember, Adalynn.
Remember how you got here.

838
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:36,730
No. No, this isn't real.

839
01:16:37,364 --> 01:16:39,066
This isn't real.

840
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,702
You've had some trouble
discerning what's real

841
01:16:41,735 --> 01:16:43,637
from what's imaginary
for a while now.

842
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:45,172
No, no.

843
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:49,410
You created an elaborate fantasy
for yourself

844
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,645
to escape the fact that you--

845
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:56,050
It wasn't your fault,
Adalynn.

846
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:58,018
Now, please...

847
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,688
give it here.

848
01:17:01,188 --> 01:17:02,256
No.

849
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,925
No, she's my baby.

850
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:10,197
Go on. Look for yourself.

851
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:16,403
No.

852
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,118
Where is she?

853
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:33,988
Where's Elizabeth?

854
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:36,123
Where's Elizabeth?

855
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,726
Please tell me.

856
01:17:40,227 --> 01:17:41,428
Maybe
you should have a seat.

857
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:43,831
No, doctor,
please tell me.

858
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:48,102
I'm sorry.

859
01:17:48,135 --> 01:17:49,904
Your baby died, Adalynn.

860
01:17:53,374 --> 01:17:54,475
-No.

861
01:17:54,509 --> 01:18:00,047
No, no, no, no, no!

862
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,916
- No, no!
<i>- Daddy!</i>

863
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:04,785
No, God, no!

864
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:07,121
Oh, no, no, no, no.

865
01:20:03,504 --> 01:20:05,239
<i>Cici.</i>

866
01:20:31,465 --> 01:20:34,636
Adalynn, I'm so glad
that you picked up your phone.

867
01:20:34,669 --> 01:20:36,370
I have been trying
to get in touch with you

868
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:38,238
for a few days.

869
01:20:38,272 --> 01:20:39,607
There was a nursery incident,
I was gonna stop by.

870
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,443
It was a whole thing.
Addy?

871
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:45,946
Cici?

872
01:20:47,147 --> 01:20:49,183
You okay?

873
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:50,384
<i>It won't stop.</i>

874
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:52,319
What won't stop?

875
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:56,156
It won't stop
until I do it.

876
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:58,560
<i>Do what?</i>

877
01:21:04,965 --> 01:21:06,166
Adalynn?

878
01:21:06,668 --> 01:21:10,070
Hey, I can't help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

879
01:21:10,104 --> 01:21:13,474
Okay?
Hey, talk to me.

880
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:15,376
<i>I lost them both.</i>

881
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,144
<i>I can't live with that.</i>

882
01:21:17,177 --> 01:21:18,312
<i>Adalynn, I</i>
<i>want you to remember</i>

883
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:19,380
<i>your breathing, okay?</i>

884
01:21:20,414 --> 01:21:21,982
<i>Okay, deep breaths.</i>

885
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:25,285
Can you put the baby
somewhere safe?

886
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:27,888
I gave her
two milligrams of Lorazepam.

887
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:30,224
It's best
to just let her rest.

888
01:21:32,527 --> 01:21:34,529
I have to say goodbye.

889
01:21:34,562 --> 01:21:36,430
<i>Adalynn!</i>

890
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:38,098
Adalynn, I want you
to stay on the phone with me.

891
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:39,534
Okay? Adalynn?

892
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:44,037
Adalynn,
I'm coming for you, okay?

893
01:21:47,975 --> 01:21:50,077
Hi, um, Dr. Bolland.

894
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:55,215
<i>Addy! Addy, stop it!</i>

895
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:57,050
<i>Whatever you're doing,</i>
<i>I want you to sit down.</i>

896
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,452
<i>Addy, can you hear me?</i>

897
01:21:58,485 --> 01:22:00,154
Sweetheart,
I'm coming to get you.

898
01:22:00,187 --> 01:22:01,623
Okay? I'm gonna come.

899
01:22:01,656 --> 01:22:03,257
I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get the baby.

900
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:05,092
Addy!

901
01:22:05,627 --> 01:22:07,261
Addy!

902
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:08,530
I'm Mary Stewart,
the grief counselor

903
01:22:08,563 --> 01:22:10,130
here at St. Patrick's.

904
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,468
<i>How is Adalynn?</i>

905
01:22:15,235 --> 01:22:16,470
She's devastated.

906
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:19,072
She keeps asking
to see the baby.

907
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:21,008
Pick the phone up.
Can you say something for me?

908
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:22,309
Addy, please!

909
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:24,211
I need to be with her
right now.

910
01:22:24,244 --> 01:22:26,013
Okay, Bill, Bill--

911
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:29,149
here.

912
01:22:29,183 --> 01:22:30,752
I'm almost here, okay?

913
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:32,986
Let's have a seat,
please.

914
01:22:34,388 --> 01:22:36,323
Addy,
pick up your phone!

915
01:22:36,356 --> 01:22:38,125
This wasn't supposed
to happen, you know?

916
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,596
We did everything right

917
01:22:41,629 --> 01:22:43,130
this time, everything.

918
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:48,168
Well, for starters,

919
01:22:48,202 --> 01:22:49,637
she's gonna need
comprehensive therapy.

920
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:57,377
That's gonna
fucking break her.

921
01:22:58,078 --> 01:22:59,213
Adalynn!

922
01:23:26,106 --> 01:23:28,075
<i>She insists</i>
<i>Elizabeth's still alive.</i>

923
01:23:28,108 --> 01:23:30,344
I know what you're gonna say,
but I think

924
01:23:30,377 --> 01:23:32,680
Adalynn could really
benefit from a reborn doll.

925
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:39,687
What the fuck?

926
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:41,388
<i>I'm dying to meet the baby.</i>

927
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:42,790
Oh, um...

928
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:47,060
we're not really up
for visitors just yet.

929
01:24:01,543 --> 01:24:02,677
It wasn't your fault.

930
01:24:05,445 --> 01:24:06,548
<i>As far as I'm concerned...</i>

931
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:08,683
It wasn't anybody's fault.

932
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:13,655
<i>If something</i>
<i>were to happen to mama bear,</i>

933
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:16,724
<i>then her cubs</i>
<i>would surely die.</i>

934
01:24:16,758 --> 01:24:19,661
<i>But if something</i>
<i>were to happen to her cubs...</i>

935
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:22,396
<i>what would become</i>
<i>of the mother?</i>

936
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:24,364
<i>Would she have</i>
<i>the strength to survive?</i>

937
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:28,736
Adalynn! Adalynn!

938
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:31,138
Absolutely certain
you wanna do this?

939
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:33,708
Yeah.

940
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:55,329
<i>And in time,</i>

941
01:24:55,897 --> 01:24:57,899
<i>we heal.</i>

942
01:24:57,932 --> 01:25:01,134
<i>And we live on to fight</i>
<i>our battles again another day.</i>

943
01:25:04,772 --> 01:25:08,208
<i>Unfortunately, I don't think</i>
<i>we'll ever win the war.</i>

944
01:25:09,476 --> 01:25:11,779
<i>But we can still fight.</i>

945
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:15,482
<i>Protect our families.</i>

946
01:25:15,516 --> 01:25:18,352
<i>Even at great sacrifice</i>
<i>to ourselves,</i>

947
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:20,320
<i>we fight.</i>

948
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:22,924
<i>We fight to the bitter end.</i>
