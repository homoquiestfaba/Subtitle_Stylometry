1
00:00:56,014 --> 00:01:00,018
<i>We reap what we sow.
That's what the Bible says.</i>

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,980
<i>Payback's a motherfucker.</i>

3
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,982
<i>I think James Brown said that.</i>

4
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,986
<i>Same shit.
We all know the story...</i>

5
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,989
<i>or at least we pretend we do.</i>

6
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,993
<i>The Hindus have
a word for it--karma.</i>

7
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,995
<i>They believe in reincarnation--</i>

8
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>that a man pays in the next life for all
the shit he's done in the previous one.</i>

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,004
<i>Keeps on payin'too,
till he gets it right.</i>

10
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>Now, if I had to do it
all over again...</i>

11
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,176
<i>well--</i>

12
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,989
<i>Responsibility. Redemption.</i>

13
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:58,994
<i>In order to be truly redeemed, a man
has to own up to his responsibilities.</i>

14
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,999
Hey, sweet thing,
what's your name?

15
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:09,004
Bitch.

16
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,007
<i>"Makin' amends."</i>

17
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,010
The cats out in Cali
like to use that one a lot...

18
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,012
especially when they get back
from a stint in rehab.

19
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,014
Of course, those be
the same motherfuckers...

20
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:24,019
sky-pagin' my ass in the middle
of the night a week after they got out.

21
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,024
Ain't that a bitch?
Still, they had a point.

22
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,988
I been away too long.

23
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,991
Runnin', hidin'.

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,994
Today's the day
I stop runnin'from my past.

25
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,998
Today's the day...
set shit straight.

26
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,876
End of chapter 12.

27
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,004
Quit it.
Damn pervert.

28
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,008
Quit what?

29
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,429
Oh, shit. Check it out.

30
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,015
The wolf
is the motherfuckin' mack.

31
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,481
Enter the motherfuckin'
dragon.

32
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,991
- Why you still here?
- We were just kickin' it.

33
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,743
Just kickin' it.

34
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,996
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you don't get yourself to school.

35
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,999
- Damn, dog--
- Stay the fuck outta this, Blue.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,004
- It just don't concern you.
- Wh-What?

37
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,507
Come on. I ain't gonna ask you again.

38
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,805
Hey.

39
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:30,020
- I'll pick you up after school, all right?
- Whatever.

40
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,773
Damn, dog. I thought
my moms was tough.

41
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,612
I wouldn't know.

42
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,574
- Moon give you that address?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,995
<i>This is what the fuck will
happen every time you don't pay me.!</i>

44
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:54,002
That's the fuck I'm talkin' about! You told
Moon you was gonna have his two grand.

45
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,005
- Where the fuck is the money at? I'm sorry.
- I'm trying to get it.

46
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,008
I really can't hear you, man.
Why don't you repeat that for me, huh?

47
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,399
This really ain't the time to be playin'
that Bruce Willis bullshit.

48
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,278
- Put your motherfuckin' hands where I can see 'em at!
- Okay, I'll--

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,363
Fuckin' deadbeat!

50
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,993
This what I'm talkin' about
right here. Hey, don't worry.

51
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,662
I'll leave you enough
to buy you a pack of Newports.

52
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,373
 That's for a new shirt, nigger!
Fucked up my boots!

53
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,001
- Please!
- Stupid motherfucker.!

54
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,549
You make your point?

55
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,843
That for sure.

56
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:48,056
- Got you a little bonus.
- That belongs to Moon, man.

57
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,019
Fuck Moon, man.
He gettin' his. This interest.

58
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,398
Then give it to him. Shit, you know
I don't play him like that.

59
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,984
So now you about to give me
this big-ass speech...

60
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,820
about what a great future we got
if we trust in Moon.

61
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,323
And they ain't gonna
do fuck about you, man.

62
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,481
After 10 long years...

63
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,694
the King has returned to reclaim
his rightful home, sweet home.

64
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,614
And goddamn,
if it don't feel good!

65
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,161
What else can I say?

66
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,980
Enter the motherfuckin' dragon.

67
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,997
- Lookee here, lookee here.
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

68
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,541
You're still uglier
than a motherfucker.

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,129
- You miss me?
- Nigger, are you insane?

70
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,257
Ain't nobody never missed
a rattlesnake.

71
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,010
How the hell could somebody
possibly miss you?

72
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,679
Oh, baby, you ain't gots
to be that cold.

73
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,015
Why don't you fix me a drink.

74
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,018
Gin and Squirt?
Still drinkin' that shit?

75
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:01,023
You don't forget shit, do you?

76
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,986
- Keep the change.
- You gonna have to do a hell of a lot better than this...

77
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,988
if you want to keep
my ass from callin' Moon...

78
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,992
and tellin' him what kind of suicidal
fool just walked into his bar.

79
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,994
- Is that so?
- That's right.

80
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,997
You just saved me some money.
I was about to give you $1 00...

81
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,000
to get him on the horn for me,
but you fucked that up.

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,004
Go on. Get him on the horn.
Go on now.

83
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,015
Sorry to disturb you, boss, but there's
somebody here you might wanna talk to.

84
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,018
Where's somewhere private
I can talk?

85
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,979
You see a champagne room
in this motherfucker?

86
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,981
Go to the toilet,
you want some privacy.

87
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:47,986
Bitch.

88
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:55,994
Well, if it ain't Hemingway.
A little early for you, isn't it, hon?

89
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,998
- One of those days. Know what I'm sayin'?
- Try this on.

90
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,999
Thank you.

91
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,002
King.

92
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,004
Nigger,
I thought you were dead.

93
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,007
You gonna be dead, motherfucker,
if you ain't got my goddamn money.

94
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,010
Well, today's your lucky day.

95
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,014
I'm here to make good, you know,
put things right between us.

96
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,017
Nigger, things ain't never
gonna be right between us.

97
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,019
<i>But I'm gonna be out
a whole lotta paper if you kick it.</i>

98
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,981
Give me a second and let me calculate
how much you into me for.

99
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,608
Bring me my book, goddamn it.

100
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,989
"See Snake."

101
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,991
It's rare you see a fuckin' snake.

102
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,993
Says here 1 5,000.

103
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,996
That's not takin' into account
interest and all that other shit.

104
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:44,418
That sounds fair. Thirty. Call it 30.
But you call off the wolves.

105
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,005
Look, nigger, my word is bond.
It always has been...

106
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,008
unlike some other shiftless
motherfuckers I know.

107
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:54,011
Yeah, nigger,
I'm talkin' about you.

108
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,013
If anything happens to you,
it ain't gonna be because of me.

109
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,016
- I can promise you that.
- I know I can count on you.

110
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:04,021
I'll see your boys, right? Maybe we'll
grab a drink, catch up on old times.

111
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:08,984
- Don't push your luck, nigger.
- Yeah.

112
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,987
''Catch up on old times.''
Ain't that some shit?

113
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,991
Jasper, give everybody
in this motherfucker a drink on me.

114
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,993
Today, I'm a free man.

115
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:22,998
I ain't never known you
to be so generous before, King.

116
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:29,004
Yeah. Keep the change and,
uh, buy yourself a dick.

117
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:35,010
So I'm, like, cool.
Back to the room, right?

118
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,020
- I'm ready to do the thang.
- What's the password?

119
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,983
Fuck your mama, bitch.
Stop playin'. Open the door, nigger.

120
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,987
Anyway--

121
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,991
Hey, Blue, why you wanna talk
to poor Rockie like that?

122
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,993
You need to learn
some manners like Mike.

123
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,996
- Ain't that right, Mike?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,999
Rock, we cool, right?
The hell with you then.

125
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,002
- You got my money?
- Damn, is that all you care about?

126
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,006
What else is there? Money...

127
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,008
pussy and money.

128
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,012
It's all there, plus the interest.

129
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,016
Cool. Always know
I can count on you, Mike.

130
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,020
- Damn, what about me?
- What about you, motherfucker?

131
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,983
I got another job for y'all.
You really gonna like this one, Mike.

132
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:35,988
You'll never believe in a million years
who suddenly came back from the dead.

133
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:40,701
- Tupac?
- You're a funny motherfucker, boy.

134
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,996
Who?

135
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:49,001
Somebody you been waitin' for
for a long time.

136
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:54,006
- D-David.
- You know, you never cease to amaze me.

137
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,010
Aren't I always telling you
how smart this motherfuckin'boy is?

138
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,015
All the time.

139
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,017
- Where is he?
- Hold on, Mike.

140
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,020
You want me to keep thinkin'
you're smart, you gotta act smart.

141
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,982
King David already made an arrangement
to pay back the money he owes me.

142
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,984
In return, I promised him
he'd be in the clear...

143
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,986
and you know I always
keep my promise.

144
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,990
You know that about me, Mike.

145
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,993
I want you and Blue to make the pickup
and bring me back my 30 G's.

146
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,996
- End of story.
- That's fucked up, man.

147
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,998
Why don't you send Rockie
to collect it, or somebody else?

148
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,001
'Cause I don't wanna send
no-fuckin'-body else.

149
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,003
You keep fuckin' with me, Blue--

150
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:36,006
Now, I want you
to view this as a test--

151
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,008
see how you handle yourself
under pressure.

152
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:43,013
Don't fuck this up. I don't want it
traced back to me. Understand?

153
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,016
- Where?
- Blue Room. 6:00.

154
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,019
You'll recognize the car
when you see it.

155
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,980
Mike.

156
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,983
Don't make me regret this.

157
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,987
That's bullshit.

158
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,994
- Ella, let's go.
- Hold up a second.

159
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:13,001
- Ow!
- I gotta do somethin' before we go home.

160
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,003
- Get in the car!
- Damn!

161
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,005
What the hell
crawled up his ass?

162
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,009
Yo, just be quiet and do
as you're told, a'ight?

163
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,019
You want a refill, college boy?

164
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,981
I do have a name, you know?
It's Paul.

165
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:38,986
Whatever. You want another drink,
or what? It's paid for.

166
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,992
- What's that guy's story anyway?
- Who, King David?

167
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,994
Shit.

168
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,998
Just look up ''back-stabbin' cocksucker''
in the dictionary.

169
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:55,002
It'll tell ya everything
you need to know.

170
00:13:55,002 --> 00:14:00,007
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

171
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,988
Let me handle this. You ain't in the right
state of mind to deal with this.

172
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:27,993
No. We gonna handle this. We gonna
do this just like Moon said we gonna do it.

173
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,995
No. We gonna do this like
I'm sayin' we gonna do this.

174
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,998
Just stay in the car and let me
take care of this, a'ight?

175
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,000
- Mike, tell me what's goin' on.
- Yo, Ella, this ain't the time right now.

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,004
- I wasn't askin' you, Blue.
- Don't get fuckin' smart!

177
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,007
Man, what the hell is wrong with you?

178
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,426
That's it, man. You stayin'.

179
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,983
I'm sorry. All right?

180
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,527
I'm sorry.

181
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,992
- You King?
- Do I look like Prince, motherfucker?

182
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,579
Let's get this shit over with, man.

183
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,999
- Here it is. 1 5,000.
- Moon said you owe 30, man.

184
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:20,003
He did? Ha!
I'm just fuckin' with you.

185
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,589
Never can be too sure.

186
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,011
- You ain't gotta count it. I said it's all there.
- Don't tell me what to do.

187
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,015
You stiffed Moon, not me. Lucky
he even takin' your motherfuckin' money.

188
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,017
Most niggers cross him
won't even get that chance.

189
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,936
At least count it in the car, man.

190
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,984
- What, you goin' campin' or somethin'?
- Excuse me?

191
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,986
You see a brother in that getup,
look like he's goin' campin'.

192
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,990
That's the problem with you young motherfuckers
nowadays. You don't know how to dress.

193
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,993
What you need to do is take some
of that money that you're gettin'...

194
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,996
go down to Canal Street, get you
a chink tailor, make you a nice suit.

195
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:58,000
'Cause, see, the women, they appreciate
a man who knows how to dress.

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,003
Thanks for the tip, man.
I'm gonna give you one though.

197
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:04,006
I advise you get the fuck outta Dodge
and stay that way.

198
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:08,010
- Unless you want more trouble. Understand what I'm sayin'?
- I'm not in the habit...

199
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,012
of takin' advice from Grizzly
Adams-lookin' motherfuckers.

200
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,891
Take your ass back to the motherfuckin'
woods and start a campfire or somethin'.

201
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:20,022
Go on now.
Excuse my back.

202
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:29,990
You still wanna wax this motherfucker,
man? 'Cause I got a plan.

203
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:44,004
Hey, girlfriend.
Where you headed?

204
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,594
Whassup?
Where you headed?

205
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,642
- How old are you anyway?
- Old enough.

206
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,561
So, uh, where you headed?

207
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,980
Heaven, baby.

208
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,609
- Do you wanna go?
- Maybe.

209
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,987
Get out the fuckin' car.!
Get out the motherfuckin'car.!

210
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,990
- Shit, Grizzly! What the fuck you go and do that for?
- Get out the motherfuckin' car!

211
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,785
- Shut up.! Get out the car.!
- All right. Hold your horses.

212
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:22,000
Look at this shit. You know
what this gonna cost to fix?

213
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,005
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey,yo, man.!

214
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,009
Hey, Scarface.
Tell your boy to chill.

215
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,011
- I'm sure we can work this out.
- What'd you call me?

216
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,014
I'm just admirin'
your beauty mark, boy.

217
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,350
You're a regular Tony Montana,
ain't you?

218
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:42,521
- Do you know who I am?
- If that was your bitch, she came on to me.

219
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:46,984
I'm askin' you a question.
Do you know who the fuck I am?

220
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,777
Nigger, do you?

221
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,996
- Gotcha, motherfucker! Gotcha!
- Let's go, Mike! We got company, man.

222
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,423
What the fu--

223
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,385
Get in! Come on!

224
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,722
Open the door.! Open the door.!

225
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:17,973
Hey!

00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,994
Hey. Somebody call 91 1 !

227
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,747
Don't let me die alone, mister.

228
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,000
I got money. I can pay you.

229
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,377
Just don't let me die in the gutter.

230
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,013
Shit!

231
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:02,017

00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,979
All right.Jasper--
No. No, no, no, no. I appreciate it.

233
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,734
I apologize to you right now for
any heat that might come down on you.

234
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,071
Now tell me. What about David?
What about David?

235
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,407
Where the fuck is he?
Who seen him?

236
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,744
What the fuck did they do
when they went there?

237
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,996
- Huh? Hold on, hold on.
- Mike's on the line.

238
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,998
- Who's this?
- Mike's on the line?

239
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,000
Jasper, let me hit you right back.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,003
- Fuck! Mike!
- It-It's Blue, a'ight?

241
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,005
He's hurt real bad.
Real bad.

242
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,009
- Fuck!
- I fucked up. I know. But we gotta get him to a doctor.

243
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,012
- Stupid motherfuck!
- Moon! Moon, you still there?

244
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,014
- Moon!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,892
Listen to me, Mike.
We can't take any more chances.

246
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,603
Where are you right now?

247
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,651
Uh, 1 1 8 and, uh--
1 1 8 and Third.

248
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,987
There's a parking garage
on 1 27 th.

249
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,989
Tell the owner that I sent you.

250
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,741
Drive in the back,
park your car in the back.

251
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,160
- You got that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

252
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,996
I'm-a have some of my boys
bring over a clean car...

253
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,998
and-and we gonna take Blue
to the hospital.

254
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,001
- Are you clear on that, Mike?
- Yes. Yes.

255
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,462
Is there anybody else
in the car with you besides Blue?

256
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,009
- No.
- Mike, listen to me.

257
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,012
You did good, baby.
You did good. Shit like this happens.

258
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:24,016
You know how I take care
of our family, take care of my own.

259
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,018
I'm just glad you came to me first.

260
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:29,980
- Calm down and get to the garage.
- All right. Thanks.

261
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,691
Mike? Are you sure
you can trust him?

262
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,694
He's all we got right now,
all right? Just drive.

263
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,696
Jesus Christ.

264
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,994
Shit.
Goddamn Mike.

265
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,997
Now I gotta worry about
the fuckin' cops again.

266
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,957
Hit the fuckin' button.
Hit the button.

267
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,839
- Red, Alvin.
- Yo, boss. What's up?

268
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,342
I got a job for ya.

269
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:10,020
It's not fair...
after all I've been through...

270
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,149
everything I've done.

271
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,987
- It can't end like this.
- Save your strength.

272
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:24,952
Talkin;
It helps ease the pain.

273
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,955
It's all I have left.

274
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,708
I'm not gonna make it.

275
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:36,004
- Just leave me here.
- You're gonna be okay.

276
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,006
I'm gonna take you to the hospital,
and I'm gonna stay there...

277
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,467
as long as I need to
until I'm sure you're okay.

278
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:43,804
Brothers see each others
buying it every day in the street.

279
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,015
No one lifts a finger.

280
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:52,020
White boy like you comes along,
saves my life.

281
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,397
It's crazy.

282
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:08,996
Help! Help! I've got a man
hurt real bad in here!

283
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,123
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
- Come on, help!

284
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,004
I got a son, you know,
I never knew.

285
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,839
Maybe you could find him.

286
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,091
Tell him his old man
was a warrior.

287
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,010
- Sir, you can't go any further.

288
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,013
Oh, my God.

289
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:49,012
- You should take off.
- I'm not leaving you.

290
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,517
<i>Oh, God.</i>

291
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,522
Hold on, dog, all right?

292
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,110
Here they come.

293
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,622
Stay with him.

294
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,899
No!

295
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:51,009
Baby, girl.
Oh, God! Jesus!

296
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:54,471
Oh, God. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

297
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,642
Shh. I got you.
Oh,Jes-- I got you.

298
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,687
I got you. I got you.

299
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,982
You gonna be all right.
You gonna be all right. I got you.

300
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,818
I got-- I ain't goin' nowhere.

301
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,987
Don't leave me. No, don't--

302
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,989
Don't leave. Don't leave! No!

303
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,995
Oh! No!

304
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,997
Ella.

305
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:21,999
Ella, don't leave me.

306
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,918
Don't leave me! Oh, God!

307
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:57,868
- Mr. Paskoff?
- Yeah.

308
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,996
He didn't make it.
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,005
Well, uh, I guess we... tried.

310
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,007
That should be worth somethin'.

311
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:15,010
Yes. Look, if you'll come with me, sir.

312
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,013
There are some formalities
we have to go over.

313
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,642
- ''Formalities''?
- Yeah.Just a couple of questions we have.

314
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,979
Like I told you before,
I didn't know the man.

315
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:30,984
- I just gave him a ride.
- Really? Come with me.

316
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,987
Do you know if he had
any immediate family?

317
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,448
He did mention that he had a son.

318
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,992
Well, he decided to make you
his beneficiary.

319
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:41,662
What's up?

320
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:46,250
I admit it seems strange to me too,
but he was insistent on this point.

321
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,586
- I didn't know this man, so--
- Don't get too upset.

322
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:54,591
It would appear to me that you've
made out very well in this transaction.

323
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,013
Pink slip to his car.
He signed it over to you.

324
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,933
- He left me his car?
- And that's not all.

325
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:08,981
He asked only one thing-- that you
take care of the expenses of his burial.

326
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:12,985
Of course, you'll be notified
when we release the body.

327
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,989
Now, ordinarily, in a homicide...

328
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,992
we're supposed to fill out
a police report...

329
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,994
turn over personal effects
to the authorities.

330
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,997
But, you know, that--
that can get complicated.

331
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,167
Of course.

332
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:34,214
Very well. I'm glad we got this
straightened out.

333
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,988
What do we say if someone
gives us a present?

334
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,490
- Thank you, daddy.
- That's right, baby.

335
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,995
All right, sugar.
Now it's your turn.

336
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,581
Yeah, you like that, huh?

337
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,542
Don't give you no cavities either.

338
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,211
Save some money on those dentist bills.

339
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,548
You know what I'm sayin'?

340
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,179
Daddy got somethin' hard
for both of y'all, but it ain't candy.

341
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,638
You wanna see?

342
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:52,269
- Who the fuck is that?
- This important.

343
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,189
Shit.
It better be important.

344
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,274
Be right back, baby.

345
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:06,742
- Rockie, what's up, man?
- I just got word from the hospital.

346
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:11,455
- David passed 1 0 past 7:00.
- That's good.

347
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:15,000
Somebody took him there,
left him in the car.

348
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,294
Now, what if David talked?

349
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:21,006
- Who?
- A white kid.

350
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,133
White kid.

351
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,011
Well, make some calls
and handle it for me.

352
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,985
<i>It's Mom. How'd your big job interview go?</i>

353
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,570
<i>Did you get it?</i>

354
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,990
<i>It's Nancy.
We're still on for tonight, right?</i>

355
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,618
<i>Give me a call, okay? Bye.</i>

356
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:53,163
<i>Mr. Paskoff,
this is Phillip Waters, Sun-Telegram.</i>

357
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,999
<i>I hope I didn't give you the wrong
impression in our meeting today.</i>

358
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,211
<i>Your writing samples are top-notch...</i>

359
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:03,590
<i>and I'm genuinely interested in seeing what
kind of story you can come up with for us.</i>

360
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,510
<i>I'll see you on Friday.</i>

361
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,001
<i>The Autobiography of a King.</i>

362
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:42,004
<i>Chapter One. "The Getaway."</i>

363
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:46,133
<i>Today
is the first day of the rest of my life.</i>

364
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:51,763
<i>I copped my stash from Moon. Now it's time
to wave good-bye to that motherfucker.</i>

365
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,309
<i>I was gonna stick around
till Mother's Day.</i>

366
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,688
<i>I figured some of my bitches would have
some extra cash for a nigger, you know...</i>

367
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,191
<i>along with those government checks.</i>

368
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,527
<i>But that stupid bitch Edna
fucked that up.</i>

369
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:10,991
<i>Had to make the phone call,
screaming her fuckin' head off.</i>

370
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:15,329
<i>Well, you know, shit happens.</i>

371
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:22,002
<i>Anyway, plan's still on track.</i>

372
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:27,007
<i>Been long months of footwork for Moon,
slowly gainin' his trust.</i>

373
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:32,846
<i>It finally paid off. Had him front me
a half a brick on consignment.</i>

374
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,306
<i>Dummy.</i>

375
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,018
<i>What the fuck
was that nigger thinkin'?</i>

376
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,562
<i>Definitely not
what I was thinkin;</i>

377
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:41,980
<i>- You know--
- Hold-- Hold it!</i>

378
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,983
- I got it. I got it.
- Moon will be lookin' for a nigger.

379
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,988
<i>No doubt about that. And I'm sure
the pigs is gonna be on my ass too...</i>

380
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,992
<i>thanks to my little, uh,
misunderstanding with Edna.</i>

381
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:58,372
<i>But fuck you, and good luck
tryin'to find me.</i>

382
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,047
<i>Everything's been
buildin'up to this point--</i>

383
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:12,010
<i>gettin' outta this hellhole
and reinventin' myself.</i>

384
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,223
<i>L.A., here I come.</i>

385
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:22,896
<i>Whoever said there was no such thing
as a second chance in life...</i>

386
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,565
<i>was a stupid motherfucker.</i>

387
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,650
<i>This is America.</i>

388
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:31,446
<i>All you need is a dream
and the will to make it happen.</i>

389
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,993
<i>It feels good havin' a clean slate.</i>

390
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:39,371
<i>Got the world on the half-shell
with lemon and hot sauce.</i>

391
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:43,125
<i>Folks out here better get ready,
'cause they ain't gonna know what the fu--</i>

392
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,755
- Hello. Nancy.
- You're still there? Do you know what tonight is?

393
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,301
I know it's our anniversary. You are not
gonna believe what I experienced today.

394
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,011
You're still at work.
You don't hear me complaining.

395
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,263
<i>Because I'm waiting for you
to fuckin' pick me up!</i>

396
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:59,016
<i>- You know what? I don't wanna hear it.
- I'm sorry.</i>

397
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,059
I'll explain it all when I get there. Plea--

398
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,813
<i>Good-bye!</i>

399
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:09,985
- Rockie, you heard anything?
- Not a word.

400
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:14,990
Jesus Christ.
Ain't this a bitch? Goddamn!

401
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,993
This shit--
This shit is fucked up.

402
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:22,998
I got plans, me and the twins, to go hear
this singer I'm thinkin'about signing...

403
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,000
and all this shit with Mike--

404
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,003
- So how you wanna play it, boss?
- If that bastard Mike...

405
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:31,006
is breathin' out there anywhere...

406
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,008
I want him taken care of.

407
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:37,012
And the white boy witness motherfucker--
I want him taken care of too.

408
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:41,016
I cannot have this shit come back
and bite me in my goddamn ass.

409
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:46,021
Everything I've worked for-- everything--
can come tumblin' down on our fuckin' heads.

410
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:51,527
Shit. You runnin' shit. Handle it.

411
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,982
<i>This is Mike.
Leave a message. I'll get back to you.</i>

412
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:41,220
- You didn't go to the police?
- Please, Nancy, keep it down.

413
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,014
No, I will not keep it down.

414
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:48,018
A pimp bled to death
in that-- that thing...

415
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,020
and you're acting like everything's
just fine and dandy.

416
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,272
I can't explain it.

417
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:58,111
If you just could've been there.
He had this... nobility.

418
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,699
- ''Nobility''?
- I need to find out why this man died.

419
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:06,119
- For my story.
- Your story.

420
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,997
Do-- Do you even hear
what you're saying?

421
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:13,335
This is not a rap video
or a Quentin Tarantino movie, Paul.

422
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,255
This is real life, your life.

423
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,467
Your whole slumming thing,
you staying uptown in that hellhole...

424
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,302
when you could be living
down here with me--

425
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,013
- I've put up with it.
- That's a cheap shot, Nancy.

426
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:28,767
What? ''Slumming''?
I'm sorry. I forgot.

427
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,729
You're a serious artist injecting
yourself into an exotic milieu...

428
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,858
for research purposes.
Isn't that how you once put it?

429
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:41,488
So, what, is, um--
Is dating me a part of your research?

430
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,081
Call me when you get a life.

431
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:15,272
<i>Snatched up a little crib near the beach.</i>

432
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,780
<i>Figured I'd check shit out for a few days...</i>

433
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:27,868
<i>before settin'up shop,
see if I could make some connections.</i>

434
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,892
<i>I made a connection, all right.</i>

435
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,907
So, you ready to go again?

436
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,618
Are you?

437
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,329
Yeah.

438
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,832
<i>Her name was Janet.</i>

439
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,002
<i>I ain't been in Cali but 24 hours...</i>

440
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:04,339
<i>and already copped me a white broad
look like a motherfuckin' movie star...</i>

441
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,425
<i>or TV anyway.</i>

442
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,804
The show is called Surf Beat.

443
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:13,015
My character's Pepper.

444
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:17,019
She's the scatterbrained
but lovable associate...

445
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,980
at the Zuma Beach Detective Agency.

446
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,648
Gotta be serious money in that.

447
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,985
Oh, it's not as good as it sounds, sweetie.

448
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:29,364
It's just cable and...
it's only reoccurring.

449
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,658
Oh! Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

450
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:35,204
- Those are the new shoes you got.
- I know.

451
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,290
Can we go back to the hotel
and do some more blow?

452
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,925
Oh, damn, David.

453
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,678
This is strong.
Maybe you oughta cut it.

454
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,389
<i>The stupid bitch
ain't even know the difference...</i>

455
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,058
<i>between coke and heroin.</i>

456
00:41:56,266 --> 00:42:00,437
<i>Fuck. It's all I had, and I didn't
have the heart to tell her.</i>

457
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:04,399
<i>Oh, well, she'd find out eventually.</i>

458
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,693
<i>They always do.</i>

459
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:11,698
<i>Within a few weeks,
business was boomin!</i>

460
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,452
<i>Everybody wanted what I had to offer.</i>

461
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:20,457
<i>I ain't even have to act
like it was coke no more. As for Janet--</i>

462
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,881
Cut! Cut, cut, cut. Geez!

463
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:31,718
<i>- Let's do another one.
- She wasn't doin' too hot.</i>

464
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:35,889
What's the matter, honey? You just
can't seem to get any energy goin' here.

465
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,018
Hey! We need you for the shot.

466
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:43,188
<i>- She still had her job though.
- Asshole.</i>

467
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:50,904
<i>Yo. Janet had it bad,
but I took care of her.</i>

468
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:55,909
<i>After all, she was really good about
hookin' me up with her coworkers.</i>

469
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:06,837
<i>Sometimes I'd get
a kick out of just watchin' the show...</i>

470
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:11,341
<i>and wonderin' if the rest of the world
could tell which members of the cast were strung out.</i>

471
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:14,011
<i>Just lookin' at the motherfuckers
made me laugh...</i>

472
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:17,514
<i>'cause I knew I could bring
their whole world crumblin' down...</i>

473
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:20,017
<i>whenever I felt like pullin' the string.</i>

474
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:25,981
- You're a fuckin' asshole.
- Yeah, but you can't live without me.

475
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,650
Oh, really?

476
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:34,072
I used to think that you livin' in L.A.
for too long would give you a big head.

477
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:37,618
- Thank God, I was wrong.
- But what would you do without me?

478
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,120
Whatever.

479
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,125
You'll see.

480
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:48,879
<i>Oh, yeah. She'd definitely see.</i>

481
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,520
- We're closed, man.
- Come on, man. My window's busted.

482
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,231
- You're the only garage around.
- Sorry.

483
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,985
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Okay.

484
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:14,112
I'll get you a ticket.

485
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:13,190
What's the password?

486
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,988
Put that thing down, man.
Mike, Moon's not here.

487
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:22,991
- Where is he?
- Don't go out like that, my brother.

488
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:24,993
Mike, me and you'll
work somethin' out.

489
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,371
What we gonna work out, Rock?

490
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:31,750
Ella's gone.

491
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:35,087
She's gone?

492
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,008
Where is he?

493
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,471
<i>I pretty much burned through
the stash I copped from Moon.</i>

494
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:50,018
<i>Those entertainment types
in L.A. are fiends. Who knew?</i>

495
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,187
<i>It was a good ride.</i>

496
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,982
<i>I cleared 25 G's easy.</i>

497
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:58,735
<i>But if I was to keep this shit goin;
I needed to do some re-in'up...</i>

498
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:00,863
<i>make myself
a West Coast connection.</i>

499
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,866
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

500
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,830
<i>Who could've guessed that
a two-bit chump like Moon...</i>

501
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,999
<i>would have better dope
than anybody in L.A.?</i>

502
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:17,838
<i>I guess the real junkies-- the ones
who know their shit--are all back East.</i>

503
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,757
<i>They scared of the sunshine.
Way I see it, though...</i>

504
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:24,011
<i>that means a golden opportunity
for anybody out here...</i>

505
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:27,431
<i>who could provide some quality shit.</i>

506
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,810
<i>Yep. Ain't no doubt about it.</i>

507
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:35,772
<i>Heroin is definitely an industry
with some serious growth potential...</i>

508
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,692
<i>and I planned to invest heavily.</i>

509
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:43,280
<i>Eventually I hooked up with some
Vietnamese cats out in Alhambra.</i>

510
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,742
<i>I hear brothers screamin' all the time
about ''dirty gook motherfuckers. ''</i>

511
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:50,370
<i>Say what you want, them motherfuckers
know how to conduct business.</i>

512
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:57,002
<i>Janet could've learned a thing or two
about a thing or two from them.</i>

513
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,295
<i>For real.</i>

514
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:04,009
<i>- Just a minute.
- No. Now!</i>

515
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,642
<i>This is David. Leave it.</i>

516
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:14,895
David, it's me. I don't
give a fuck where you are.

517
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,855
Please. I--
It's a fucking emergency.

518
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,525
I ran out, okay?
So, please--

519
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,236
I really need you, okay?

520
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,571
So call me back.

521
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:30,994
<i>- You know the bitch lost her job...
- Sorry.</i>

522
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:32,704
<i>right before the third season.</i>

523
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:37,000
<i>Had the nerve to blame me, like
I had somethin' to do with that shit.</i>

524
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:40,838
<i>And me, I wound up losin' interest.</i>

525
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:48,971
<i>She found herself a new job.
Paid the bills.</i>

526
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,858
<i>Left me with time to focus...
on other things.</i>

527
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:23,005
I'd offer to buy you a drink,
but you probably get 'em on the house.

528
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:26,300
Gee, I, uh-- I've never
heard that one before.

529
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:32,014
- So, what's your name, girl?
- Busy.

530
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:36,018
- Oh! I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

531
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:38,604
It's only vodka. It won't stain.

532
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:42,357
- So, what's your name?
- Look, I'm sorry. I'm really busy.

533
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:45,903
Lookin' as good as you do,
I just wanna know your name.

534
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:49,239
- Juanita.
- Pretty name.

535
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,992
I'm David.
Friends call me ''King.''

536
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:54,995
Oh, well, let me guess.
You're lookin' for a queen?

537
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:57,581
You don't cut a brother no slack, do you?

538
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,709
Well, you know, we meet
a lot of creeps in here.

539
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,212
Look, sorry again about your drink.

540
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,840
How about you make it up to me by letting
me take you out to dinner this weekend?

541
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,009
I can't. I'm studyin'.

542
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,012
Oh, college girl.
Should've guessed.

543
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:14,473
You don't really fit in
with this crowd.

544
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:17,809
- How about next weekend?
- Midterms.

545
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,772
- Can I call?
- I'll tell you what.

546
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,068
I'm workin' next Thursday. Come back
and ask me then, and we'll see.

547
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,986
- Okay?
- I'll do that.

548
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,531
Now, if you'll excuse me.

549
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,118
<i>She was everything a man could want--</i>

550
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:39,414
<i>beautiful, intelligent, uncorrupted.</i>

551
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:43,001
<i>I promised myself right then and there...</i>

552
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,711
<i>she'd be mine.</i>

553
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:58,892
I'll be right back.
I gotta hit the head.

554
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,184
Shit.

555
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,105
Who the fuck is this?

556
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,984
No. It's okay,Jasper.
You didn't know.

557
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,611
What's goin' on?

558
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:53,363
Now slow down.
Slow down.

559
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:55,199
Give it to me again.

560
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:59,536
I'm on it. It's all good.

561
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:01,455
Okay.

562
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:06,043
Give me a second.
This is business, okay?

563
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:12,090
Yeah.

564
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,010
<i>- Yo, Larry. You at Mike's?
- Uh-huh.</i>

565
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,012
<i>- Did he show?
- No. No sign of him.</i>

566
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:20,057
Go down to the Blue Room. That
white boy's there. Make him disappear.

567
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:22,017
<i>- The Blue Room?
- Yeah.</i>

568
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:23,560
A'ight.

569
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:46,416
Daddy, take this cold wind
from me.

570
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:12,776
This is on the house, honey.

571
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,653
Don't go nowhere.
I'll be right back.

572
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,162
Wait.! Wait.!

573
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,834
- There she is!
- Hi!

574
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,984
Hmm! You already missed him.
Nice goin'.

575
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,361
- Where the fuck did he go?
- How the hell should I know?

576
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:59,281
But considerin' he's the only
white boy around here...

577
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,991
and he's drivin' around
in a pimped-out Stutz...

578
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,660
he shouldn't be
that fuckin' hard to find.

579
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:21,011
<i>Thursday came...</i>

580
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,680
<i>and not a moment too soon.</i>

581
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:28,060
<i>Operation Juanita was in full effect.</i>

582
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:37,653
Again? Girl, who they from?

583
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:40,572
- Shh!
- What does it say?

584
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:47,663
After I finish this semester,
I plan to stay on...

585
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:52,000
and get my graduate's degree in social work--
you know, help out disadvantaged children.

586
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,170
It's important to give back,
you know?

587
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,006
I think we should check the car.

588
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:02,886
- You might have left your halo in the backseat.
- Are you makin' fun of me now?

589
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:05,389
You're not like any other girl
I've ever dated before.

590
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,934
You're a strong sister.
Ambitious.

591
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:12,980
- But I know what your weakness is.
- Really?

592
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,190
Okay, well, I'm all ears.

593
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:18,944
Same thing make you laugh
will make you cry.

594
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:23,782
Your strength...
is your weakness.

595
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:27,786
<i>Turns out
that wasn't her only one.</i>

596
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:29,997
Shit.

597
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:34,918
David!

598
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:42,009
- Can I try some?
- Sure.

599
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,760
<i>Guess they ain't a bitch alive...</i>

600
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,429
<i>who don't like a little coke
every now and then.</i>

601
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:48,348
<i>Makes 'em kinda freaky too.</i>

602
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:53,145
<i>Truth be told,
they were freaks to begin with.</i>

603
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:10,097
- What's this?
- I think it's about time you got your own place.

604
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,936
You're breakin' up with me?

605
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,107
David--

606
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:23,443
You gonna help, or you gonna stand
here talkin' about ''David, David.''

607
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:31,994
- What's her name?
- Does it matter?

608
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,288
She movin' in here with you?

609
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:39,084
You know, I haven't asked her yet,
but I'm hopin' she will.

610
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:49,928
You must really like her.

611
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:57,019
Guess I can't say
I didn't see this coming.

612
00:57:57,436 --> 00:58:00,981
Look, it's not like I'm firing you.

613
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:04,943
You're a smart girl
and a damned good worker.

614
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:07,237
You got a job as long as you want.

615
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,200
Great.

616
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,162
You're a real motherfuckin' saint.

617
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:26,423
- Oh, Mom doesn't drink.
- Sorry about that.

618
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:33,722
To the most beautiful member
of the graduating class.

619
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:41,021
So what line of work did you say
you were in again, Mr., uh--

620
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,106
David. My friends call me David.

621
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,277
Um, various investments
around town.

622
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:51,406
I'd have to say my primary source
of income would be exporting.

623
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,576
- Hmm.
- I have to go to the little girls' room.

624
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,662
Excuse me.

625
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,015
I think we should move in together.

626
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,810
You're kidding, right?

627
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,729
Do I sound like I'm kidding?

628
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:25,983
I can't move in with you, David.

629
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:27,109
Why not?

630
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:32,322
I don't approve of your lifestyle.

631
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:37,327
I don't recall you complaining when you were
snorting up everything in front of you.

632
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:40,581
- You're missing the point.
- Check it.

633
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:43,000
I got, like, 150 grand saved up.

634
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:46,003
Pump it up to, like, 250,
get a house in the country...

635
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:48,589
just get away from all this shit.

636
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:51,925
Baby, you're small-time,
and you always will be.

637
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:57,556
You think a quarter of a mil
is enough to retire on?

638
00:59:57,848 --> 01:00:00,267
A quarter of a mil ain't shit!

639
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,689
Did I hurt your feelings?

640
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:09,443
Look. I'm just tryin'
to be honest with you.

641
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:12,988
Baby, look at me.

642
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:14,990
Look at me.

643
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,993
Now, I like partying with you...

644
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:20,996
and I love fucking you.

645
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,998
But that's where it ends.

646
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:25,709
Now, why turn it into
something that it's not?

647
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:30,297
Let's just have fun while it lasts.

648
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:31,965
Okay?

649
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,890
Yeah, we'll do that...

650
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,558
while it lasts.

651
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:45,312
<i>She had me wrapped
around her little finger, and she knew it.</i>

652
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:48,649
<i>I used to laugh when I heard
niggers talk about bein' in love.</i>

653
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:52,820
<i>Even writin' the word makes me
feel helpless, but it's true.</i>

654
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,990
<i>I'd never felt this way about another
person in my life, except my mother.</i>

655
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,994
<i>And I didn't like it. I mean this
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

656
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:04,498
<i>I hated this feeling
that I had for Juanita.</i>

657
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:09,711
<i>It made me feel like I was--
like I was weak.</i>

658
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:14,091
<i>We couldn't have that.</i>

659
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:27,020
<i>They say revenge
is a dish best served cold.</i>

660
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,982
<i>I was about to take my shit
right out the motherfuckin' freezer.</i>

661
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,651
<i>Bitch thought she was gonna
get by without me...</i>

662
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,779
<i>she'd be thinking again real soon.</i>

663
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:39,783
<i>Might as well call me
a broken-down trick.</i>

664
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:42,995
<i>Using me for my money, then telling me
a quarter mil ain't good enough.</i>

665
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:45,581
<i>A quarter mil's always good.!</i>

666
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:50,586
<i>It was good then, and it's
sure in hell still good now.</i>

667
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:58,010
<i>It was good then,
and it's sure in hell still good now.</i>

668
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:02,890
<i>It was good then,
and it's sure in hell still good now.</i>

669
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,060
<i>Still good now.
Still good now. Still good now.</i>

670
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:20,824
- Don't shoot. I give you--
- Shut up. Shut up. All I need is a ride.

671
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,825
Get in.

672
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,492
Just keep drivin'.

673
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:52,583
Whoa. Stop the car.
Stop the car.

674
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,251
Back up.

675
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:57,379
Slowly.

676
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,887
Right here, right here,
right here.

677
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:43,175
<i>- Why was the tiger scared of the movie?
- Why?</i>

678
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:45,010
<i>It was rated ''R-R-R-R.''</i>

679
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,638
<i>- That's some funny shit.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

680
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:49,515
<i>Come here.</i>

681
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,396
- What do you say?
- Thank you, daddy.

682
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:59,107
That's right, baby.
Now give your sister some.

683
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:03,070
Come on, baby.

684
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,990
But don't drop it. What the fuck?

685
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,992
What the fuck did you do?
Goddamn it!

686
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:11,411
Oh, shit. Get my phone.

687
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,748
Shit.

688
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,005
Hello?

689
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:24,341
Motherfuckers hung up.

690
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,010
A'ight, bitch.
Tell me another joke.

691
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:32,683
Mike. Son.

692
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:19,605
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Moon.</i>

693
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,733
<i>We spotted the white boy
at the garage.</i>

694
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,069
<i>We followed him north
on Fifth Street.</i>

695
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:32,743
<i>Responsibility. Redemption.</i>

696
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:37,748
<i>In order to be truly redeemed, a man
has to own up to his responsibilities.</i>

697
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,630
<i>Tuesday. Moving day.</i>

698
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:47,966
<i>It didn't have to come to this,
but the bitch left me no choice.</i>

699
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:52,012
<i>Three months
of planning had finally paid off.</i>

700
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:55,265
<i>Unfortunately, a little too well.</i>

701
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:02,773
You bastard! Why haven't you
been returning my calls?

702
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:04,983
I went out of town, man.
I didn't tell you?

703
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:08,987
No, you didn't tell me.
Aren't you gonna open the door?

704
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:12,991
- Not if you continue in that tone of voice, I won't.
- Open the fucking door!

705
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:16,745
- Try asking nicely.
- Please.

706
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:25,504
So what seems to be the problem?

707
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:29,716
You know damn well what the problem is.
You did this to me.

708
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:33,846
I did this to you? I didn't put a gun
to your head and make you sniff no coke.

709
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:37,808
You didn't give me coke,
you fucker. You gave me heroin!

710
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:40,727
That's right. I did.

711
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:45,732
So what do you want me to do?

712
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:49,987
Baby, I just need a fix.

713
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:54,158
Look, just for the day, okay? You know,
just to get me through it. Please?

714
01:07:54,158 --> 01:07:55,993
- Right.
- Just one, okay?

715
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:58,662
Yeah. But you know
us small-timers.

716
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:01,832
You know, we gots
to watch every penny...

717
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:05,961
and, um, it don't look
like you have a penny.

718
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,340
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

719
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,015
<i>She was right.</i>

720
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:23,020
<i>I did do this to her,
and I was enjoying it.</i>

721
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:27,441
<i>Funny shit was,
I still loved her.</i>

722
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:30,986
<i>Maybe more now than ever...</i>

723
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:33,989
<i>because I finally
felt needed, appreciated.</i>

724
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,712
Come on back. Anytime.

725
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,760
<i>Juanita got more
strung out than I ever could have imagined.</i>

726
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:57,679
<i>Bitch started shooting right away.</i>

727
01:08:57,763 --> 01:09:01,642
<i>Most girls are scared of needles.
Keeps 'em from getting out of control.</i>

728
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,395
<i>Not Juanita.
Turns out she was diabetic.</i>

729
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:10,984
<i>For her, sticking herself was like brushing
her teeth or going to the bathroom.</i>

730
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:16,990
<i>Don't take a rocket scientist
to figure out that eventually...</i>

731
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:19,993
<i>something had to give.</i>

732
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,005
They bought two.

733
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:42,015
- Yeah?
- I-- I need help.

734
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,853
<i>Look, there's a clinic up north.
It's the best in the state...</i>

735
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:48,355
<i>and I wanna check myself in.</i>

736
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:52,943
But it's expensive.
It's 1 0,000 a month.

737
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:57,990
And I know it's a lot of money,
but I need this.

738
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:02,995
You have to help me.
If you don't, I'll go to the police.

739
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:05,455
<i>One thing bitches don't realize...</i>

740
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:07,541
<i>is that they should never
joke about the police.</i>

741
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:11,587
<i>Breaking a man's heart is one thing, but
fucking with his livelihood is something else.</i>

742
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:15,007
I knew you'd see things my way.
I'll meet you at 8:00.

743
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:20,471
<i>I wonder how she
felt inside after hanging up that phone.</i>

744
01:10:20,471 --> 01:10:24,016
<i>What was on her mind?
Like the sunset that day.</i>

745
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,769
<i>Do you think it occurred to her
for a split second...</i>

746
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:31,315
<i>that it was the last one
she was ever gonna see?</i>

747
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,320
<i>You know that thing
Yogi Berra used to say..</i>

748
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,988
<i>"Dja vu all over again."</i>

749
01:10:38,697 --> 01:10:40,991
<i>Might as well
have been talking about me.</i>

750
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:41,992
<i>Here I am trying to resolve
things with Juanita...</i>

751
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:42,993
<i>Here I am trying to resolve
things with Juanita...</i>

752
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:45,496
<i>and it's just like the mess
I'd gotten myself into...</i>

753
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:48,832
<i>the day I left the East Coast--
that shit with Edna.</i>

754
01:10:48,832 --> 01:10:51,752
I mean it, King. I need money.

755
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:54,254
For what? So you can shoot it
in your fucking veins?

756
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:56,757
I told you. I-I'm clean now.

757
01:10:57,007 --> 01:11:00,511
- Six weeks.
- I've heard that one before.

758
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:03,013
No, you think I like
asking you for money?

759
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,016
There's no food in the house.

760
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:09,019
The kids need clothes for school.

761
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:14,274
You know, you owe this to me.

762
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,781
I-- I'll go to the police.

763
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:23,450
Oh, wait a minute, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

764
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:26,370
Don't do that.

765
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:30,999
I'll be right over.

766
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:33,252
<i>Edna.</i>

767
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:36,380
<i>Yeah, I used to run around
with her back in the day.</i>

768
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:39,007
<i>Bad-ass bitch 'fore that junk
got hold of her.</i>

769
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:42,427
<i>Somehow she got it in her head
that I was the father of her boy...</i>

770
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:46,390
<i>and conveniently waited till now,
10 motherfuckin' years after the fact...</i>

771
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:48,600
<i>to break the news to me.</i>

772
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,812
<i>Maybe I was. Maybe I wasn't.</i>

773
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:54,982
<i>But she wasn't gonna do her kids
any good if she was still usin;..</i>

774
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:58,986
<i>and I sure in hell wasn't gonna
do 'em any good rottin' in a jail cell.</i>

775
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:03,991
<i>So I decided to give her a test
to see if she was on the level.</i>

776
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:09,997
Well, aren't you gonna let me in?

777
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:13,000
- I'm glad you came.
- So am I.

778
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,837
I'm sure we can, uh,
work this thing out.

779
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:23,302
- Got somethin' to drink?
- Go ahead. Help yourself.

780
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:28,724
Ain't got nothin' to eat
in this motherfucker.

781
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:35,606
Do you mind? I don't want
to eat you out of house and home.

782
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,779
Damn!

783
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:46,450
It's hotter'n
a motherfucker out there.

784
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:50,204
David, I need help.

785
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,003
Come on, baby.
You ain't gots to be like that with me.

786
01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:01,048
Come here.

787
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:04,885
Come here.

788
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:10,641
What the fuck is wrong with you,
threatening to call the police on me, bitch?

789
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:14,186
Must be out your motherfuckin' mind!

790
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,104
Leave her alone!

791
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:18,982
Get the fuck outta here!

792
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,692
Leave him alone!

793
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:24,404
Look at you.

794
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:29,159
This what you want
the money for?

795
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,538
You better enjoy it.

796
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:35,666
It's the last thing
you're gettin' from me, boo.

797
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,626
Get the fuck outta my way!

798
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:49,012
<i>Didn't stick around long enough
to see if she ever did pass that test.</i>

799
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:53,600
<i>What I did was hit the airport.
Got me a one-way to L.A.</i>

800
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:22,796
Mom!

801
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:29,011
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

802
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:34,266
Mommy.! Mommy.! Mommy.!

803
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:42,816
Aren't you gonna let me in?

804
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:51,783
<i>Dja vu all over again.</i>

805
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:12,638
<i>I drifted around
for a while, duckin' the law.</i>

806
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:16,016
<i>Worked my way east
from small town to small town.</i>

807
01:15:16,016 --> 01:15:19,853
<i>Something was calling me back.
I missed my home.</i>

808
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:23,690
<i>Plus it's hard livin' on the run,
especially when you realize it's your fault...</i>

809
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:28,487
<i>gettin' yourself stuck in the same sort of
fucked-up situation you ran away from 10 years ago.</i>

810
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:32,991
<i>The Lord takes care of fools and babies,
and I've never been either one.</i>

811
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,746
<i>So I'm back, and it's time for King to put
things right, face up to my responsibilities--</i>

812
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,999
<i>to Moon, to Edna's boy, to myself.</i>

813
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:44,002
<i>Responsibility. Redemption.</i>

814
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:47,005
<i>In order to be truly redeemed,
a man has to--</i>

815
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:50,008
Get out the car.!
Get out the motherfuckin' car, white boy.!

816
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:53,720
Get out the motherfuckin' car!
Get out the car now!

817
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,014
- Okay.
- Do it now.!

818
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:59,017
- Get out the car!
- Please don't kill me!

819
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:02,980
Motherfucker, I'm gonna count to three.

820
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:06,984
One, two, three.

821
01:16:14,658 --> 01:16:17,494
Don't come near me!
I'll kill you! I mean it!

822
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:29,006
You.

823
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:33,260
If you're worried about me
goin' to the police, I didn't. I swear.

824
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,013
I don't care about that.
Now put the gun down.

825
01:16:37,848 --> 01:16:40,434
I won't hurt you.

826
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,567
- What's your name?
- Paul.

827
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:53,071
Fuck is a white boy like you doin'
uptown in a dead man's car, Paul?

828
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:57,743
He gave it to me before he died.

829
01:16:57,868 --> 01:17:01,079
He give you that ring too?

830
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:06,001
Take your ass home, man.
You don't belong here.

831
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:09,630
I need to know why.

832
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:17,012
- Why what?
- Why did you kill him?

833
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:21,308
- He deserved it.
- Believe me, I know.

834
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:25,479
But why did you kill him?

835
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:36,949
He killed my mother.

836
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:40,494
Edna?

837
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:50,087
The man that you killed...
was your father.

838
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:58,428
You see, he has these tapes of--

839
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:01,765
I've been listening to 'em.

840
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:07,354
See, when he was dying, he--
he asked me to bury him.

841
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:08,438
He--

842
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:20,325
He begged for a decent burial.

843
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:22,828
Hallowed ground.

844
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:28,625
Oh. Man.

845
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:31,003
Hurry. Come on.

846
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:34,715
You gotta get outta here.
Take the car.

847
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:36,800
There's a quarter million
dollars in the trunk.

848
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,014
It's yours. You're free.
Go! Get outta here! Go!

849
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:49,104
Go.

850
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:24,014
An amazing story.

851
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:26,016
Truly amazing.

852
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:28,811
- But I can't print it.
- Why not?

853
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:31,021
This is a newspaper,
not a fiction magazine.

854
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:34,149
But it's true, all of it--
the stabbing, the hospital.

855
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:36,777
I had a gun pointed at my head!

856
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,282
You're a great writer.
If it's a job you want, you're hired.

857
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:43,951
But that--

858
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:51,333
Unfortunately,
I don't believe a word of it.

859
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,002
<i>Tell you the truth...</i>

860
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:57,005
<i>I probably wouldn't
have believed it either.</i>

861
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:02,010
<i>After all, I did live
a pretty extraordinary life.</i>

862
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:06,890
<i>It's too bad it had to catch up
with me when it did...</i>

863
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:10,352
<i>before I had a chance
to turn the corner...</i>

864
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:16,275
<i>and write the final chapter.</i>

865
01:20:36,295 --> 01:20:40,007
<i>Fate's a funny thing
when you think about it.</i>

866
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:49,183
<i>How everything is interconnected,
like a game of dominoes.</i>

867
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:01,320
<i>How one man's life can have
such a powerful effect...</i>

868
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,282
<i>however inadvertent,
on the lives of so many others.</i>

869
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:14,458
<i>How it can transform itself into
a gift that keeps on giving.</i>

870
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:30,015
<i>Like I said, I guess my life
was pretty extraordinary.</i>

871
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:36,355
<i>In the end, I suppose it all comes back
to the whole karma thing.</i>

872
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:38,982
<i>Who knows.</i>

873
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:41,985
<i>If it's half as real as the Hindus say...</i>

874
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:46,365
<i>I may just get a second chance after all.</i>

875
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:52,412
<i>I wonder, what lies ahead
for me on the other side?</i>
