1
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,315
Access the footage from Wesley.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,236
We got to the temple this morning,

3
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,205
and sent the unit advisors away
right after lunch.

4
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,866
Funny the way things work out sometimes.

5
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,876
The only reason we found this place

6
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,505
is because they were looking for weapons
of mass destruction that didn't exist.

7
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,550
God definitely has a master plan.

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,689
The tomb was undisturbed,

9
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,221
but it'll probably take
another couple of days to get to them.

10
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,610
Dr. Chandler completed his assignment
this morning.

11
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,806
He was ready.

12
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:30,946
We all know the sacrifices we have to make.
Never seems to get any easier.

13
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,016
I miss Moray.

14
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,269
This could be a chance
to change things forever.

15
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,325
Fulton says I'm crazy,
but I want to get closer.

16
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,692
I need to get closer.

17
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,446
I stopped Fulton and the others
from leaving.

18
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,012
They scared them in.

19
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,210
It always starts with hallucinations.

20
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,482
Then what could happen?

21
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,025
I can't believe it's come to this.

22
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,852
No one can leave.

23
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,910
Get it out, get it out of my head.

24
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,887
Who do we send?

25
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,057
I know the perfect person.

26
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,448
All my life, I've been a soldier of fortune.

27
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,284
Did what I had to do to get the job done

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,950
and get my team out alive.

29
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,894
This mission shouldn't have been
any different.

30
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,771
But it turns out,
some things can't be killed with a bullet.

31
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,946
Dr. Cardell is on the ground.
I repeat, Dr. Cardell is on the ground.

32
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,883
Thunderbird 307
heading back to civilization.

33
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,620
Have fun, boys and girls.

34
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,536
I could put you out of your misery, rookie.

35
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,662
-You ever flown combat before?
-Yeah, a bunch of times.

36
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,268
-Videogames don't count, man.
-screw you all. All you all.

37
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,039
Elite unit, my ass.

38
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,082
-Target practice, Hammer?
-lt ain't loaded, boss.

39
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,621
Give me that.

40
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,022
All right, listen up. You've all been briefed
about where we're going.

41
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,789
This is Dr. Cardell,
she's here to tell us why we're going.

42
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,126
Meet the Angels.

43
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,395
Yoshi, Hicks,
this is our medic, sergeant Harrington.

44
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,266
-You can call me Doc.
-Nickels.

45
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,231
-Com tech.
-You can call me Nickels.

46
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,470
This is our computer specialist, Click.

47
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,535
-And the big guy is...
-sergeant Diego Garcia.

48
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,606
-I've been briefed on your unit, Captain.
-ClA puke.

49
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,978
As you know,
the research station at shabaka

50
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,353
was hit by a seismic event 36 hours ago.

51
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,052
All attempts to reestablish contact
since then have failed.

52
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,754
And what kind of research are they doing
in the middle of the desert?

53
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,822
-The work is classified.
-That's all right, we can keep a secret.

54
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,968
It's an archeological site.

55
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,766
Its previous owners used it
as a storage facility,

56
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,399
but when we acquired it,
we found something.

57
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,033
something that cannot be moved,

58
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,045
something that my superiors say
we don't need to know about.

59
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,048
-Yeah, same shit, different day.
-What do we get to blow up?

60
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,812
Actually, sergeant, it's an extraction.

61
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,145
This is a fucking joke, right, boss?

62
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,986
With all due respect, honey,

63
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:04,519
but you don't need this hurricane of pain
to dig a bunch of scientists out of the sand.

64
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,465
He's right, Mack, we're shake and bake, man,
not search and rescue.

65
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,867
We're not here to rescue
a bunch of scientists. Just one.

66
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,838
Who? King Tut?

67
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,233
Dr. Lee Wesley.
Can you pass that around, please?

68
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:24,147
Nothing else is to be removed
from that station. Is that clear, sergeant?

69
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,144
Wouldn't he have contacted somebody
by now if he was still alive?

70
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,244
There is a safe room.

71
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,448
But if the quake knocked out their uplink,
there's no way that...

72
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,287
Getting a signal,
that would be impossible. Yeah.

73
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,451
Anything else we need to know

74
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,258
before we get this stupid mother-fucker
out on his ass?

75
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,825
-Actually, there is one other thing, sergeant.
-Oh, yeah? What's that?

76
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,599
That stupid mother-fucker is my father.

77
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,810
It's getting pretty nasty on the horizon.
Let's load up.

78
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,300
-I'm hit. I'm shot.
-Hicks.

79
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,607
-Hey, don't you let him die.
-Fuck!

80
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,670
What the fuck happened?

81
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,441
It's another ClA cluster-fuck, sir.
The locals aren't getting the message.

82
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,279
Well, next time remind me
to get a translator.

83
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,751
-You look like shit.
-sorry, boss.

84
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,216
-Can you move him?
-I'm working on it.

85
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,660
-Wilcox?
-He's dead, sir.

86
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,420
-You want this?
-Get the fucking thing away from me.

87
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,125
Goddamn heathen.

88
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,664
Mack!

89
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,185
Buckle up and finish your smokes, ladies.
It's going to be a rough one.

90
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,937
-What's the forecast?
-Look for yourself.

91
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,305
We going to be able to find the beacon?

92
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,781
Fortunately, we got a strong signal.

93
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,684
Probably wouldn't be able to see anything
in that shit storm.

94
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,315
synch on my mark. Now.

95
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,849
Better be ready in six hours,
or you're marching out.

96
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,837
This wind will bore in your skin
like a blowtorch. so stay tight.

97
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,490
-Move out. Go, go, go, go.
-Go, go, go.

98
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,764
Move it, rookie. soldier up.

99
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,410
I got to go, Mack. The wind's too strong.
See you in six hours.

100
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,680
-Base camp's been totally blown away.
-stick together and find the hatch. Hooah?

101
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,554
Move out.

102
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,401
Eye on the prize, Captain.

103
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,676
On my mark. Three, two, one.

104
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,348
Clear.

105
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,820
Let's move it.

106
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,900
Hustle up.

107
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,884
Yoshi, clear the perimeter.
Hicks, two-by-two formation.

108
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,764
Damn, it's hot in here.

109
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,961
Quit bitching, rook.
It can't be no more than 80 degrees in here.

110
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,368
Feels like fucking Cancun to me.

111
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,416
-Clear.
-Clear.

112
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,054
Clear.

113
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,484
Down!

114
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,493
-ls he all right?
-Yeah.

115
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,801
-Give me some room.
-Jeez.

116
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,777
-What's wrong with him? Is he contagious?
-I don't know.

117
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,382
Hey, you know, l, I really don't want
to spend a month in quarantine

118
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,315
when we hit stateside.

119
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,778
He's not febrile, all right?

120
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,688
If I had to guess, I mean, this looks like...
Like radiation poisoning.

121
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,385
But I don't know.

122
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,260
Well, I got nothing on the Geiger counter.

123
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,765
What is a priest doing here?

124
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,411
Alfeo Jacoby. He's from The Vatican.

125
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,449
-I thought you were a doctor.
-My doctorate's in anthropology.

126
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,798
Man, that's some sick-ass shit, bro.

127
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,924
It's like when Blakeley and l
were in the swamp for two days.

128
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,593
-Blakeley?
-Our last CO.

129
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,969
Yeah, we came out, our whole bodies
were covered in two-inch leeches.

130
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
Feel good, having something that big
in your pants, Nickels?

131
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,201
You want to take a little peek, huh? Kiss it?

132
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,872
-Mack.
-All right, guys, come on.

133
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,848
Let Doc work her magic.

134
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,120
Didn't mean to hit on your girlfriend, Doc.

135
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,418
-You okay?
-Yes. I mean, no.

136
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,086
-Well, which is it?
-someone's in the safe room.

137
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,194
-ls it Wesley?
-I can't tell.

138
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,097
There's people wandering
around everywhere.

139
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,494
And the bad news?

140
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,161
Look, lady, I ain't got time
for bullshit games.

141
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,706
If you know something, you need to spill it.

142
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,237
Well, the whole base is locked down.

143
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,509
We can't go any further
without an override code.

144
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,849
Or a really good hacker.

145
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,081
-Click.
-Yo.

146
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,679
Get over here.

147
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,587
We need you to get into that network
and get the elevator working.

148
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,026
I'm on it.

149
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:39,494
Listen up, we're going down in five.
Get your gear in order.

150
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,741
-Hey. What's up?
-Cardell was wrong.

151
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,681
The quake didn't knock out
this com system.

152
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,244
They got torn to shreds from the inside.

153
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,258
How long is it going to take for you
to get it working?

154
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:05,593
Patch this up, about an hour.
There's no power running to this thing.

155
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,098
Could be a blown relay downstairs.

156
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,668
Boy got skills, or what?

157
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,905
I can see
why The Pentagon didn't cut you loose

158
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,969
after you hacked into their database.

159
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:25,983
Oh, yeah, you company men.
Know all, see all, hear all.

160
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,882
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

161
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,252
Hell of a first step.

162
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,950
You're not going to piss yourself,
are you, Click?

163
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,822
How deep did you say this hole was,
Dr. Cardell?

164
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,420
-A thousand feet?
-Just ignore them.

165
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,457
Yeah l...
I'm not worried about them. It's this.

166
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,471
What's the Gehenna Project?

167
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,497
I don't know.

168
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:53,306
Yeah, it looks like a bunch
of encrypted data files.

169
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,007
But they won't be encrypted for long.

170
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,984
Come on, come on, breathe.
Breathe, God damn it, breathe.

171
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,122
Breathe.

172
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,661
Breathe, breathe, come on, Nate, breathe.

173
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,034
-You look like shit.
-sorry, boss.

174
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,937
Mack.

175
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,841
We'll get you out of here, son.

176
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,318
-Can you move him?
-I'm working on it.

177
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,159
-We got to pull rank, Captain.
-I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

178
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,320
That's what happens
when you get a chest wound.

179
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,359
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,228
-I'm cleaning out his airways.
-That's disgusting.

181
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,172
-Give me that.
-Here you go, boss.

182
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,175
-You okay?
-I'm trying to get this guy stable,

183
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,074
but his vitals are for shit.

184
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,639
-Maybe he's got allergies or just bad acne.
-Would you shut the fuck up?

185
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,482
-Mack, we got to get him out of here.
-Well, can we call the chopper back?

186
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,886
Not in this storm, not without the uplink.

187
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:15,359
May I remind everyone,
nothing is to be removed from this station.

188
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,088
That includes him.

189
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,062
You know what? That's bullshit.

190
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,466
No, Doctor, that's a direct order.

191
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,733
You know, this is exactly
what you said wouldn't happen.

192
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,569
I'm not leaving him.

193
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,905
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not. Mack, he's a priest. Okay?

194
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,347
That may not mean anything to you,
but it does to me.

195
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,115
Well, set Nickels up with what he needs
to do and pack your gear.

196
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,553
-Him?
-Me?

197
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,219
Cardell's right. Our orders are no souvenirs.
so pack your gear.

198
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,525
No, no, no, no, l... I ain't touching him.

199
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,590
-Yes, you are.
-Yes, I am.

200
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,932
We'll plug the power back in downstairs.

201
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,768
I want that uplink fixed
by the time we're back. Hooah?

202
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,000
Hooah.

203
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,477
It's like Tal Afar all over again.
Asses flapping in the wind.

204
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,207
You're up, Hicks.

205
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,195
-Fuck.
I want this to go by the book.

206
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,430
We get Wesley, we get the hell out of here.

207
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,963
-Ready?
-This badass was born ready, boss.

208
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,202
Let's move.

209
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,298
I love this shit.

210
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,343
-No grab ass, you two. Get in here.
-Come on.

211
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,538
Dr. Cardell, you reset your transponder.

212
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,244
Hicks, rig the rookie, would you?

213
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,645
Happy hunting.

214
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,271
Keep your safeties on.

215
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,543
Hey, this ain't so bad.

216
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,902
Welcome to hell.

217
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,207
You want something for that?

218
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,774
Lock and load.

219
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,563
You know, in our line of work,

220
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,839
nothing gets you killed quicker
than dragging civvies into a hot zone.

221
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:23,278
Especially those wearing panties.
stay with us, lady.

222
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,323
Earthquake.

223
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,799
-Hold it.
-ls everyone okay?

224
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,777
What the hell?
This place is coming down on our asses.

225
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,047
Where do these leads go?

226
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,018
When Wesley's team found this place
it was booby-trapped.

227
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,453
They hauled out enough C-4
to blow it up two times.

228
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,686
-Who's maintaining this place?
-Dr. Wesley's team.

229
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,217
Enough chatter. Hammer, Yoshi, take lead.

230
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,059
-Let's move.
-Okay.

231
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,496
stay sharp.

232
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,713
How many people did you say
were down here?

233
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,688
Twenty scientists, some security personnel.

234
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,889
It's up ahead.

235
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,481
What the hell is that?

236
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,984
For God so loved the world...

237
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,287
Over here, boss. What is that?

238
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,153
Who's that?

239
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,960
Now why would God make such a bad deal?

240
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,830
-ls that Wesley?
-I can't tell.

241
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,034
Identify yourself.

242
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,778
We've been called many things
throughout the millennia.

243
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,905
-But Wesley isn't one of them.
-son of a bitch.

244
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,682
Where do you turn for the answers you seek,
Dr. sarah Harrington?

245
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,456
The Authentic, the Barclay,
the Contemporary, the New American,

246
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:53,157
the New English, the New Evangelical,
the Revised, the Restored, the Worrell?

247
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,330
Have you ever wondered
why there are so many

248
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,995
if only one truly showed the way?

249
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,136
I'll bet you have, Doc.

250
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,504
We got no time for this shit, Mack.

251
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,534
Without the shedding of blood,
there can be no remission of sin.

252
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,214
Let me help you repent.

253
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,450
Doc, get over here.

254
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,359
Doc? Doc, what's wrong with you?

255
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,362
He knew my... He knew my name, Mackie.
He just said my whole name.

256
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,924
shit.

257
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:35,439
-That son of a bitch is spitting battery acid.
-All right, just hang on. Let me help you.

258
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,305
-How'd he know my name?
-What was he talking about?

259
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,335
-scripture, Old Testament. Hebrews 9:.22.
-What does it mean?

260
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,872
It means all her friends has gone loco,
that's what it means, Mack.

261
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:46,940
shit.

262
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,047
sedate him, Doc. I don't want
this guy wandering around down here.

263
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,749
Hey, soldier up.

264
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,091
Knock him out, Doc.

265
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,762
If we have to, we'll lock him in the elevator.

266
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,644
Okay, now just keep it open, all right?

267
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,694
Captain.

268
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:46,243
I don't think you got anything
to worry about with this guy there, Click.

269
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,171
shit.

270
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,881
Good thing the bullet didn't hit the tank,

271
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,386
or none of this shit
wouldn't be here anymore.

272
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,362
-You're the only one who can help me.
-What?

273
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,842
-Why didn't you get it out of me, sarah?
-I'm sorry.

274
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,680
Why did you let me die, you bitch?

275
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,044
I don't...

276
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,217
You're the only one who understands.

277
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,320
It says, "Welcome to hell."

278
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:43,833
-You can read that?
-Yeah. I speak a bunch of languages.

279
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,494
What? You can't?

280
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,803
How we doing, Doc?

281
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,578
sergeant Harrington?

282
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,983
Harrington, do you copy? Doc?

283
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,252
-Click!
-Yeah?

284
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,759
Get up here.

285
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:15,231
-Where is she, Click?
-shit, I barely have a signal.

286
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,324
Find her.

287
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,393
straight ahead a hundred yards.
Moving fast.

288
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,961
Then so do we.

289
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,249
Dr. Cardell, what's down here?

290
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,910
-Engineering.
-Hicks, Yoshi.

291
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,078
-sir.
-sir.

292
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,951
Get to communications relay
and get the power back on,

293
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,888
-so Nickels can get us out of here.
-Yes, sir.

294
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,119
-Click, you go with them.
-Yeah.

295
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,957
Don't forget your gun, rookie.
And don't screw up.

296
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,362
-Hammer, take point.
-You got it.

297
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,458
Nickels, do you copy?

298
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,011
Nickels, do you copy?

299
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,207
Hey, yeah, yeah. Barely, you're cracking up.

300
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,105
How's the priest doing?

301
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:13,182
Priest? The priest is...
No change. still passed out and creepy.

302
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,649
Watch out for him.

303
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,993
No, he, he's not supposed to get tranqued
for another 15 minutes.

304
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,257
That's not what I mean.

305
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,958
Yeah, but you're breaking...
You're breaking up.

306
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,728
stay clear of him and get the uplink fixed.

307
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,966
Go... Go again. You're... You're breaking up.

308
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,937
Hammer, do you copy?

309
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,606
-Can we move him?
-Yeah.

310
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,201
Let's get him out of here.

311
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,509
We got to pull back, Captain.

312
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,542
-Don't you let him die.
-I can't breathe.

313
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,586
That's what happens
when you get a chest wound.

314
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,220
Incoming.

315
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,494
-Hammer blew the shit out of them fuckers.
-Get him up.

316
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,840
Keep moving, Dr. Cardell.

317
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,954
All right, stay sharp. Let's find that relay
and get the hell out of here.

318
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,076
Go that way.

319
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:24,188
-Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.
-I will shoot you. Get down here.

320
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,120
-What was that?
-I don't know.

321
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,493
Come on.

322
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,098
It's coming from in there. Click, open it.

323
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,540
All right.

324
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,511
-This is it.
-Open it. Fast.

325
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,521
You ever stop to think
that maybe it's locked for a reason?

326
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,495
You're not here for your opinions. Open it.

327
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,697
-All right, here we go.
-Move.

328
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,000
-Here we go.
-Move.

329
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,563
Yeah, move it.

330
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,475
What is that fucking smell?

331
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,384
Oh, fuck.

332
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,692
Mack. Mack.

333
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,803
-What the hell happened here?
-Keep moving.

334
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,419
Who are they trying to keep out, boss?

335
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,788
Or who are they trying to keep in?

336
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,700
Cut him down, Hammer.

337
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,778
There are those devoid of divinity.

338
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,875
Mack, listen. That's Dr. Wesley.

339
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,185
Dr. Cardell.

340
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,055
Hospitals cramped with the mentally ill.

341
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,495
Those who see clearly the truth.

342
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:28,630
This cosmic game of good cop, bad cop.
We all fell for it.

343
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,535
It's a recording.

344
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,311
And God looked upon the earth,

345
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,345
and, behold, it was corrupt.

346
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,487
Hammer, it's me. It's me.

347
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,358
-What's going on with the power?
-Low-level transformer's fried.

348
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,456
One of the locals grabbed a main bus.
Both hands.

349
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,557
Was it Wesley?

350
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,364
Have you seen what 299,999 volts
does to your complexion?

351
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,531
-sir, what the fuck is going on down here?
-Yeah, what she said.

352
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,905
And nobody said nothing about crawling
through a bunch of dead bodies

353
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,910
-and barbed wire.
-Mack!

354
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,107
-Doc's signal. It stopped moving.
-How far?

355
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,545
Give me that.

356
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,345
About 199 feet that way. storage room.

357
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:23,326
All right, go, go, go. You two, stay here.
Anybody gets passed us...

358
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,353
-Take them out.
-That's right. Let's go. Come on.

359
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,033
Yeah, something's getting past him. Right.

360
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,173
Way too many rat holes in here.

361
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,147
Let's keep moving.

362
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:51,348
-Click, position.
-Twenty feet ahead, down the stairwell.

363
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,084
You sure you're reading that thing right?

364
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,457
Yeah, we should see her
at the bottom of the stairs.

365
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,341
They move about the earth with such ease.

366
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,906
Hospitals cramped with the mentally ill.

367
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,917
Those who see clearly the truth.

368
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,118
What is this bullshit?

369
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,293
-ls it Doc?
-No.

370
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,751
No one.

371
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,097
-We bounce topside and wait for the cavalry.
-Quiet.

372
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,404
-Hey.
-Oh, it's you again.

373
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,110
Where's my soldier?

374
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,220
she's not your soldier anymore.

375
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,285
You blind fools.

376
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:14,928
We offer the same salvation,
just without the rule book.

377
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:20,103
-Where's sarah?
-Come with me. I'll show you the way.

378
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:25,411
Together we will dine on the afterbirth
of her new becoming.

379
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,822
-What's that?
-I don't know.

380
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,259
The coms aren't working. Mack?

381
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,318
stay here.

382
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:49,968
Hey, get over here.
We did our part, now you do yours.

383
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,267
Dr. Wesley?

384
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,270
This cosmic game of good cop, bad cop.
We all fell for it.

385
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,179
Some of us harder than others.

386
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:04,548
Slaughter one another,
and anoint ourselves with ash.

387
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,315
Mommy?

388
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:13,156
-We got some C-4 that can help you, Doctor.
-Just hurry up.

389
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,291
This is Dr. Elissa Cardell,
is anyone in there?

390
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,727
Yoshi?

391
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,429
Yoshi?

392
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,464
What the fuck?

393
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,878
Look at your conflict.

394
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,813
You try to convince yourselves
your existence on this ball of dirt

395
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,850
is not a dead end.

396
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:46,755
Then I show you the truth of your faith,
and you don't accept it.

397
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,628
Make up your mind!

398
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,575
I think you got him.

399
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,350
How the hell is this bitch still wiggling?

400
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,310
Nickels.

401
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,853
Nickels, do you copy? Nickels? Nickels?

402
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,457
I want you to tell me
what the hell's going on.

403
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,964
-I don't know.
-Bullshit.

404
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,696
-What are they doing down here?
-I told you, I don't know.

405
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,970
I'm done risking my team
for some Agency jerk-off.

406
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,441
-This isn't a ClA project.
-But covering up is?

407
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,573
Fuck this. Let's move.

408
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,444
You don't have the authority
to make that call, Captain.

409
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,541
I think he just did, lady.

410
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:48,116
You want to stay? Be my guest.
I have no problem leaving your ass.

411
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,094
some kind of biohazard down here
that I wasn't briefed on.

412
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,825
It's not your job
to worry about what's down here.

413
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,163
-It's your job...
-What the fuck do you know about my job?

414
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,134
My job is to get my team out alive.

415
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:03,697
When I shoot somebody and they don't die,
makes it hard for me to do my fucking job.

416
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,242
You can't do this.

417
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,003
I told you we'd get you down here.
I didn't say anything about staying.

418
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,310
Captain!

419
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,265
Dr. Cardell. It is you.

420
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,499
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

421
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,667
Who is this, Doctor?

422
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,769
This is Father Jacob Fulton.
He's part of Wesley's team.

423
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,940
-What's going on down here?
-He wouldn't understand.

424
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:49,076
I just saw a dead man
quoting chapter and verse. Try me.

425
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,021
I want my soldier back.

426
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,556
Is my father still alive?

427
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,084
The last time I saw him,
he was in the temple.

428
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,530
That's where your friend
would have been taken.

429
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,932
How did you know she was taken?

430
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,968
How did you know she was taken?

431
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,877
Mommy?

432
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,750
Yoshi.

433
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,115
Where are you?

434
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,969
Hi, Mommy.

435
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,371
-Hey, baby.
-Look what I found, your bear.

436
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,012
My mommy gave me that bear
on my fifth birthday.

437
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,888
My mommy never gave me anything.

438
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,658
No bears, no birthdays. Nothing.

439
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,897
Except a place in hell!

440
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,568
I asked you a question, Father.
How did you know she was taken?

441
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,769
God wiped us out once before.
It's all part of his design.

442
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,870
I don't give a damn
what game God wants to play,

443
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,677
-I just want my soldier back.
-Your soldier is going to die.

444
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,341
We're all going to die if we stay here.

445
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,352
And you know the way
to this temple you spoke of?

446
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,651
-Yes. But... No...
-Let's go, come here.

447
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,521
-I want to go back.
-Lead the way, Father.

448
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,085
Go.

449
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,882
-What the hell are we shooting at?
-What are we shooting at?

450
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,287
-What's wrong with you?
-she was here.

451
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:17,431
-Yoshi.
-I saw her, I swear to God, Marcus.

452
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:25,204
-someone talk to me.
-It's Yoshi, she's seeing things, boss.

453
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,712
Hallucinations.
It always starts with hallucinations.

454
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,447
-What did you see, Yoshi?
-I don't know.

455
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,962
I didn't see shit, boss.

456
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,290
It didn't just look real, Mack, it felt real.

457
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,803
To the temple now.

458
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,501
she can't come with us.
They use visions to tempt us.

459
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,572
Wesley thought he could contain it.

460
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,944
I tried to convince him
it's down here for a reason.

461
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,914
I don't give a damn
what you think is down here.

462
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,957
You take us to the temple right now

463
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,618
or I put a bullet through your head
right now.

464
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,527
stop. He'll take us.

465
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,390
All right? Please.

466
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,876
We got to pull back, Captain.

467
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,547
Incoming.

468
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,393
Get him up.

469
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,629
Let's go.

470
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,473
-What the hell happened?
-Bad day at the office. We lost Wilcox.

471
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,203
Everybody outside.

472
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,847
You okay, boss?

473
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,986
Never better.

474
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,771
I hate this horror crap.

475
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,826
I can't go, I can't let it happen. Not to me.

476
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,591
You fools don't understand.

477
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,467
All you're going to find in the temple
is despair.

478
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:13,272
-You're going to find despair, old man.
-Wait. I got a better idea.

479
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,869
Is this really necessary?

480
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,151
Absolutely.

481
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:35,327
You appeared. Oh. Wow.

482
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,950
Blasphemous.

483
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,430
shit.

484
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,377
Hey.

485
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,649
Captain, Captain.

486
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,303
-Doc.
-Open the door.

487
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,000
-I don't know.
-I promise I won't tell.

488
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:34,579
Look, you need to listen to me, okay?
You can't trust them.

489
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:38,985
Especially that bitch, Cardell. All right?
I know what's going on here.

490
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,786
It's not good.
I can get us out of here, come on.

491
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:48,295
Open the goddamn door, Click,
get me out of here.

492
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,501
Captain...

493
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,932
No, get off me.

494
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,343
Let me give you your penance.

495
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:08,476
Then you can be beautiful, just like me.

496
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,523
Come on.

497
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,802
-Come on.
-Be right with you, boss.

498
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,765
-What the hell was that?
-Nothing like your videogames.

499
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,273
Eat this.

500
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:57,533
-What happened?
-Fed Click's new friend some C-4.

501
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,501
Blew a 599-pound shit bag into next year.

502
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,733
The blast caved in the passage.
There's no going back that way.

503
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:08,005
Oh, that's great. That's just great.
Now what are we supposed to do?

504
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:12,344
-Man, how could you be so stupid?
-Oh, yeah? I just saved your ass, didn't l?

505
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,543
And what the hell you were doing
back there anyway, huh?

506
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,213
There's an access tunnel
that runs parallel to this corridor.

507
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,813
-We can use that.
-You heard the lady, Click.

508
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,223
-Get the door open.
-Yeah, yeah.

509
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,354
Okay.

510
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,269
That's going to have to do.
Hicks, get him inside.

511
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,207
Yoshi, Hammer,
burn anybody that isn't Doc.

512
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,213
Come on. Go.

513
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,622
-What about Wesley?
-Fuck Wesley.

514
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,068
Where is she?

515
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:15,309
-You told me my soldier was here.
-I told you we had to leave.

516
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,604
Mack, look at this.

517
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,879
It's like a bunch of
ancient-fire-and-brimstone shit.

518
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,853
There's stuff here from all over the world,
different religions.

519
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,219
Hebrew, Christianity, Buddhism.

520
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,123
-Click.
-Yo.

521
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,683
What's it say?

522
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,796
I can't read spanish.

523
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,397
You can read Latin,
but you can't read spanish?

524
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,030
-Hammer, get in here.
-Yes, sir, boss.

525
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,138
-What is it, boss?
-What does this say?

526
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,812
Let's see.

527
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,618
It's a testament from a farmer.

528
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:01,680
He said he saw an angel cast from heaven,
2,999 years ago.

529
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:10,989
What the fuck?

530
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,432
It moved. Mack, it... It moved.

531
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,910
Look, look, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

532
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,842
I'm telling you, it moved.
What the fuck is that thing?

533
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,446
Huh?

534
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:37,991
Doctor Chandler sacrificed himself
to stop it from spreading.

535
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,457
All right, I want to get out of here.
Yeah, I want... I want to go.

536
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,499
I... I'm cold, I'm hungry,

537
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,631
and I'm tired of you gung-ho mother-fuckers
pretending you got this shit under control.

538
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,039
Quit acting like a little bitch.

539
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,404
-He's right.
-What?

540
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,879
It is cold.

541
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,480
It's coming from somewhere over here.
Behind this door.

542
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,782
-It's freezing.
-Go on.

543
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,321
scream if he moves, rookie.

544
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,624
Mommy?

545
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,799
Over here.

546
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,495
This way, Mommy.

547
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,318
Doc. Where have you been?

548
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,789
Do you believe, Yoshi?

549
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:21,755
-Do I believe what?
-What you see, what you feel.

550
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,796
sometimes our faith changes who we are.

551
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,140
sometimes who we are changes our faith.

552
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,178
What are you doing?

553
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,417
Come in. Look.

554
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:03,236
-You can see her?
-Of course I see your unborn child.

555
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,766
she's beautiful.

556
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,581
I told you it was cold.

557
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,481
-What am I looking at?
-The wrath of God.

558
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,331
You might not believe this, Father,
but you are expendable.

559
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,490
And I'm about two seconds away

560
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,056
from expending your brains
all over this floor

561
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,068
if you don't tell me what the hell that is.

562
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,468
-A nephilim.
-A what?

563
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,334
A nephilim.
Go on, Father, tell him where it's from.

564
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,741
Was he down here studying spacemen?

565
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,451
It's not from space.

566
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,658
-Yeah? What is it, then?
-An angel.

567
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,623
Not an angel from heaven,
an angel cast from heaven.

568
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,292
An angel at war with God.

569
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,979
Nephilim are present
in almost every religion.

570
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,918
In the Bible, the Torah.

571
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,219
Even obscure scriptures
make reference to them.

572
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:33,661
Genesis speaks of the sons of God
coming to earth and assuming human form.

573
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,292
They corrupted mankind.

574
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,766
Ignored the boundaries
of their own domain,

575
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,498
until God passed his judgment
and wiped the slate clean.

576
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:46,804
started over.
Imprisoned them in tombs like this.

577
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:53,914
That's not ice. It's the hand of God.
That's why the adjurists are here.

578
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:58,450
-The what?
-The adjurists. A group with one purpose.

579
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:03,054
To find the fallen angels
and exorcise their evil.

580
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,785
They sacrifice themselves
to absorb the nephilim spirit,

581
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,855
to make sure that they never escape again.

582
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,198
-Like that?
-Exactly. But we were too late.

583
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:17,433
We found dozens of them down here.
But not like this one. It's evil.

584
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,732
He's in Wesley.

585
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,243
Why didn't you tell me any of this before?

586
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:27,977
You are on the front line of the biggest
battle mankind has ever fought, Captain.

587
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:33,187
-Besides, would you have believed me?
-Bullshit.

588
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:50,071
-ls this a dream?
-It's a gift.

589
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,279
It's a chance to make things better.

590
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:02,148
I didn't have a choice.
Not if I wanted to stay with the team.

591
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,416
-With Marcus.
-With me.

592
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,630
seeing her hurts.

593
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,904
I know. But you don't have to hurt anymore.

594
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,917
You don't have to hide your pain.

595
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,585
Or your desires.

596
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,531
What are you doing?

597
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,425
Why'd you drag us down here?

598
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,560
Why couldn't you just bring this thing up
to the surface and pick it apart up there?

599
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:59,074
You're not listening. That's what they want.
To be free from the tomb that God created.

600
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,609
The fools never listen.

601
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,611
They'll come to you in ways
you can't imagine,

602
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,977
Iike a wife, a lover, a child.

603
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,140
Child? Yoshi.

604
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,414
Yoshi?

605
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,657
-she's gone, Mack.
-Click. Click.

606
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,295
Get Yoshi back here AsAP. Hammer.

607
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,772
I know your pain, Yoshi.

608
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:41,783
My sister, she trusted me.

609
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:50,359
The tumor on her spine, it was so small,
but I didn't get it all.

610
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,821
And the cancer ate her up
from the inside out.

611
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,801
I won't let that happen again.

612
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,992
Is this the way out?

613
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,125
-ls this the way out?
-Yes.

614
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,035
-What's on the other side of this door?
-The possessed.

615
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,007
Besides the possessed,
you simple son of a...

616
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,671
-I have no idea.
-How come I don't believe that?

617
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,475
-Click.
-Yeah?

618
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:49,245
-Get this door open, we're leaving.
-Thank God.

619
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:09,099
-What the hell happened?
-Bad day at the office. We lost Wilcox.

620
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,833
Everybody outside.

621
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,904
-How much longer?
-Just another couple of seconds.

622
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:40,394
It's clear?

623
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,454
-so we can go now, man.
-Easy.

624
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,798
-We leave when I say we leave.
-Man, we got to get out of here.

625
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,337
Where the fuck is Hammer, you know?
Hammer.

626
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,033
Yoshi.

627
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,905
Yoshi.

628
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,715
Mary, Mother of God.

629
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,352
Hammer.

630
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:14,930
-Hicks, what the fuck are you doing, man?
-Don't let him hurt me, Marcus.

631
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,356
I know where Yoshi is. she needs you.

632
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,398
-she's one of them.
-she's one of us.

633
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,101
Don't you get it?
This is what the priest said.

634
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,405
she's fucking with your head.

635
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:36,077
Put your weapon down, that's an order.

636
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,284
-I can't do that.
-No!

637
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,751
Doc?

638
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,225
-What are you doing?
-I'm not checking out

639
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,266
unless I got proof
of what you people are doing down here.

640
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,029
Nothing can leave from here.

641
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,070
Lady, quit holding him up, okay?

642
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,127
I mean, I'm not waiting here

643
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,470
for more of these moaning mother-fuckers
to bust in.

644
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,768
Fuck. Hammer...

645
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,213
Get her off of me!

646
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,649
Move!

647
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,430
Come on, Click.

648
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,410
-Hey, Captain.
-What happened?

649
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,504
It's Hicks. He's gone completely loco.

650
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,209
-He just shot at me.
-Why?

651
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:46,051
I saw Doc. she looked like one of them.
It doesn't look good, boss.

652
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,420
-It's not much better here.
-shit.

653
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:53,121
There's more fuckers out there, Mack,
and they're probably coming this way.

654
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,857
Are you all right?

655
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,635
Look at me. Does it look like I'm all right?

656
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,069
I mean, this is some shit-covered,
marshmallow kind of evil

657
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,936
that I did not sign on for.

658
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,568
-Take a seat, soldier.
-I ain't no fucking soldier, okay?

659
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,246
I mean, I shouldn't even be here.

660
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,780
Click, sit.

661
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:23,850
You know, I got you down here,
and I opened up your Gehenna files.

662
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,121
You told me I'd be safe,
I don't feel fucking safe anymore.

663
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,826
Oh, God. Oh, God, you did it, didn't you?

664
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:36,104
Holy Jesus,
now I understand why you're here.

665
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,265
To access Gehenna.

666
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,310
Hey, hey, Father! Hey, Father!

667
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,217
What was he talking about?

668
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,578
Yoshi.

669
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,984
-Yoshi.
-Marcus.

670
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,531
Marcus.

671
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,139
-Jesus.
-Help me.

672
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,647
Come here.

673
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:31,856
I found her.
I found our baby, and I held her in my arms.

674
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,320
-What?
-she has your smile.

675
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:43,235
Calm down, baby.
Everything's going to be okay. I'm here now.

676
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,000
-Who did this to you?
-Doc.

677
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,105
she's helping me.

678
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,514
Well, I'm here now,
I'm going to take you, okay?

679
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,880
Okay. It's my back.

680
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,219
I... I don't know if I can walk.

681
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,932
Is it bad?

682
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,535
sorry, Marcus.

683
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,988
Do you want some help with that?

684
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,537
I asked you a question.
What was he talking about?

685
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,671
-The explosive rigs by the elevator.
-What about them?

686
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,510
Wesley's team didn't disarm them.

687
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:08,489
They installed them,
in case something like this happened.

688
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:13,384
-Come again?
-To incinerate everything.

689
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,896
-so you pushed a button?
-How long?

690
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,524
Hey, how long?

691
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:24,834
Twenty-nine minutes, 32 seconds.
It's counting down.

692
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,706
I don't get it, why would you...

693
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,506
Why would you detonate it
before the shuttle's due back?

694
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,274
How are we supposed to get out of here?

695
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,515
We weren't.

696
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:39,553
This never was about getting Wesley out,
was it?

697
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,820
You were sent here to make sure
that he doesn't. That none of us do.

698
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,987
You sick bitch.

699
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:53,063
We should waste you right here, pendeja.

700
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:58,835
-Why not blow this place from the surface?
-I couldn't. Wesley changed the code.

701
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:03,106
-Then how did you activate it?
-I didn't. He did.

702
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,807
No, no, no, you did not just say that.

703
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,946
I needed a really good hacker
to pull the trigger.

704
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,146
I didn't know. I didn't know.

705
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,058
You used us.

706
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,194
I did what I had to do. Did what I was told.

707
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,836
If anyone should understand that, it's you.

708
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,837
How do we shut it off?

709
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,800
Only from the surface,
and only with the code.

710
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,742
What's the code, lady?

711
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:44,284
Weren't you guys listening?
Wesley is all Four Horsemen rolled into one.

712
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,315
He hits the surface,

713
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,380
what's happening down here
will be happening everywhere,

714
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,790
and there will not be any way to stop it.

715
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:56,059
-Give me the code.
-Get that thing out of my face.

716
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,123
Give me the goddamn code!

717
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:06,970
It's not going to work.
she's not afraid to die. Are you?

718
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,034
-I've been ready for this since I was born.
-Fuck.

719
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,878
My father trained me.

720
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,423
so this whole ClA thing was just a cover?

721
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,856
More like a means to an end.

722
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,702
You completed your mission
before we even got in the elevator.

723
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:41,140
Why still go looking for Wesley?

724
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:47,508
shit.

725
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,877
so what do we do
if we can't find our way back?

726
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,082
One problem at a time.

727
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,160
If anyone can hear this,
you got 15 minutes to get the elevator

728
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,430
before you're a permanent resident
in this hell hole.

729
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,170
-Come on, go!
-Let's move.

730
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,607
-Let's move.
-Come on.

731
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:18,044
-Mack, I can't hold it.
-Come on! Come on!

732
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:19,137
I can't hold it.

733
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,876
-Come on!
-Come on!

734
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:24,644
Go!

735
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:28,079
-You're a soldier now, man.
-Come on, Captain!

736
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,920
It's an honor, boss.

737
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,724
We got to go, sir. We got to go!

738
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,197
Go, go, go, go, go!

739
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,257
Come on!

740
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:18,265
Father, let me help you.

741
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:31,985
Bye, Father.

742
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,829
Which way? Which...

743
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,225
-Don't tempt me.
-This way, Captain, this way.

744
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:06,543
shit. Eyes on me, Click.
We're almost out of here.

745
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,290
Elissa.

746
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,272
-Dad.
-shit.

747
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:30,134
What little is left of your father
is very sorry to see you here.

748
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,481
You look just like your mother.

749
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:42,382
I'm surprised they sent you.
You're not ready. I thought I was ready.

750
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:49,594
But I was just a child as you are now.

751
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,661
What's happening to him?
Why doesn't he look like the others?

752
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:58,468
The nephilim is inside of him.
We can't let him leave, Mack.

753
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,866
Why is he still here?

754
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:05,778
I'm waiting for you
to follow your orders, Mack.

755
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,681
My time in this skin suit is almost over.

756
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:14,114
I need for you to bring me
a new set of clothes.

757
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,747
Yeah, right.

758
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:18,952
Remember what you said when you arrived?

759
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:24,590
You told your friends, "You find Wesley
and we get the hell out of here."

760
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,607
Well, you have no idea how right you were.

761
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:37,980
Hey.

762
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,112
Nickels.

763
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:51,558
I got your message, man,
and I'm ready to roll.

764
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,725
-Don't you fucking move.
-Click, lock and load.

765
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:03,897
Now.

766
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:20,119
Click! Click!

767
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,484
-Click!
-Captain!

768
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,554
Click.

769
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,628
Click, Click, Click?

770
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:54,317
You look like shit.

771
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,088
I never felt better.

772
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,657
You know,
you and I aren't that different, really.

773
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,794
Both of us bred
to do the dirty work of bosses

774
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,396
who will never truly appreciate our skills.

775
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,373
You'd make a great angel.

776
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,776
I am ready.

777
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:23,808
Baby, you're a very, very naughty girl.

778
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,200
-Jesus.
-stop name-dropping, Mack.

779
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:55,544
Well, if you won't let me in,
how about someone you actually care for?

780
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:03,250
We could try your ex-wife,
the one who left you.

781
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,597
Or maybe the daughter
you never got to see grow up.

782
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,503
Or how about someone special,
like your best friend?

783
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,243
-How you doing, Mack?
-Blakeley.

784
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:28,848
I heard you ended up with the angels.
That's a pretty good tradeoff.

785
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,715
But I got to be honest with you,

786
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:35,154
I'm not too impressed
with your leadership skills.

787
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:38,715
Pretend to be whoever you want to be,
I know you're not real.

788
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:44,994
Really? You've had a memory of me,
of what you did, for the past five years.

789
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,894
If that don't make me real, you're crazy.

790
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:53,675
Mack, do you know the seven deadly sins?

791
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,507
Man's roadmap to his failures.

792
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:02,847
Guilt isn't a sin,
but in your case maybe it should be.

793
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,446
It wasn't my call.

794
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,685
You don't remember what happened. Why?

795
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,559
You never did answer that question, Mack.

796
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,777
What are you doing?

797
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:54,492
-Why did you do it, Mack?
-I did what I was told.

798
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,035
What a good little soldier.

799
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,341
You ever stop to think they might be wrong?

800
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,071
Did you really have to do me in
to shut me up?

801
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,313
I did what I was told to do.

802
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:14,480
What makes you think
one more would make a difference?

803
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:17,616
Do you know how many millions have died
in these deserts

804
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,786
in the name of the Father and the son?

805
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:23,888
But they couldn't do it without
people like us to carry out their plans.

806
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:27,530
People who blindly trust their actions
to others.

807
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,070
Lie, deceive.

808
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,005
I never believed in the Father or the son.

809
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,670
You weren't chosen by chance.

810
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:39,043
We knew you'd do what you were told.
And do it well.

811
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:43,783
You are on the front line...

812
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,683
We can't let him leave, Mack.

813
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:50,018
Why did you do it, Mack?

814
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,157
All right, maybe I am going crazy.

815
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,699
Let me show you the way, Mack.

816
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:15,877
I knew you wouldn't let me down again.
I knew it.

817
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,818
-Maybe God does have a plan.
-God?

818
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,423
Don't talk to me about God.

819
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:35,800
He gives you pathetic creatures
the gift of choice, and what do you do?

820
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:40,531
You use it to turn your back on him
first chance you get.

821
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:45,278
You chose to take this mission.
You chose to kill your best friend.

822
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,139
You chose to seek me out.

823
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,845
Thank God for free will.

824
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:59,792
Yeah. Thank God.

825
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,068
Dad?

826
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:56,202
-We have to go. Now.
-I can't go.

827
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:06,451
-What have you done?
-What I was trained to do.

828
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,448
To free my father's soul,
that was my mission.

829
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,588
You have to leave.

830
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:25,303
-I'm not going to leave you like this.
-You have to leave me like this.

831
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,770
You understand.

832
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:40,619
No. But I believe you.

833
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,482
For the first time, I know my purpose.

834
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:00,226
My place in the world.

835
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:06,356
I have a new mission, bigger than myself.

836
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:12,563
I'm a new soldier in a very old war.
