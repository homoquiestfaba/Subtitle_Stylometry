1
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:31,635
"Financial Times"
was a small two-piece thing -

2
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,600
That humans may cause
bunch of extinction.

3
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,367
The story was buried in page six.

4
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:46,836
This is how people take care of the problem.

5
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,320
Not at all.

6
00:00:55,512 --> 00:01:00,363
Check your cell phone.
The signal is interfered with here.

7
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:06,004
How you doing, Louie?
-How Many cameras do you have?

8
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:09,458
Pöydällänikö?
-No, But stick to you.

9
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,644
Less than seven, more than two.

10
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:19,936
I make an order: one hat camera,
two buttonhole camera -

11
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:25,677
Sports bras,
one bottle camera, tactical shirt.

12
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:33,166
Now it describes.
Make sure that the buckles are correct.

13
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,519
Booking is
10 minutes.

14
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,364
We are sitting at the table

15
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:53,805
Is the recording site?
-There is.

16
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,445
Shrimps.

17
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:05,882
How do I know much about sushi?

18
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,207
He brought me here last year.
-You Have an exotic flavor.

19
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:19,646
Subscribe oath, when you're ready.

20
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,011
Just the point. Minutes.

21
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:36,042
Here comes the whale.

22
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:44,687
Yep. Three return.

23
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,881
Bingo!

24
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,045
The trend of the restaurant owners and chef
-

25
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:58,248
May be charged with
tarjoiltuaan endangered animals.

26
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:03,323
Case revealed the filmmakers took
stuck.

27
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,719
Gobi Desert, Mongolia

28
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,576
We make the road by yourself.

29
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:20,366
The skull is big.

30
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:26,284
I did a "National Geographic"
four extinction story.

31
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,289
I went to beautiful places.

32
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:37,961
Dinosaurs was
eye can see.

33
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:43,686
It happened a long time ago.

34
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:49,089
What if that happens currently,
and we do not notice it?

35
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:59,002
In Nature extinction die
one in a million species each year.

36
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,488
Over the next few decades -

37
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,685
We drive species extinct
one thousand times normal speed.

38
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,175
It is difficult to estimate exactly how many species we lose
.

39
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:14,167
Hundred years -

40
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,878
We may lose
50 percent of all species.

41
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:26,369
I remember thinking,
that this is the world's the biggest thing.

42
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:31,497
When we lived in the time of dinosaurs,
but we can do something about it.

43
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:05,965
Blue whale is the largest animal the earth,
larger than any dinosaur.

44
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:09,210
Sinivalaatkin
are in danger of extinction.

45
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:14,652
It swam towards!
-Look!

46
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,050
Blue Whales were asked
brink of extinction.

47
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,328
Remaining was about two per cent of capital.

48
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:26,365
Now, they reduce the frequency of ship traffic.

49
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:30,332
Go! It swims about you right.

50
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:36,887
I hope that when people see the blue whale
beauty -

51
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,965
They can be saved.

52
00:05:56,799 --> 00:06:03,009
Blue Whale song is
animal kovaäänisintä.

53
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:09,325
People do not hear it,
because it is too shallow for us.

54
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:19,247
We look at the world with their own senses
and we think we are seeing it all.

55
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:26,652
But there is a secret world.

56
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:31,245
I want people to see it.

57
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:03,295
When we left the ship,
fisherman came to his interpreter -

58
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:07,809
And asked for a $ 500 finder's fee
finds on the buoy -

59
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:10,653
Which must be returned to the United States.

60
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:14,807
I glanced at the buoy.

61
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:20,974
Return address points at the Chris Clark, Cornell
bioakustinen laboratory.

62
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,370
A familiar man!

63
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:33,649
Chris had created new ways of record
whales for 30 years.

64
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:39,643
He testified that the whales hear
each other across the oceans.

65
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,966
Finding the buoy was the
I had found a bottle of mail.

66
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:52,212
We built recording systems,
we dropped them into the sea -

67
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,133
And record and without interruption.

68
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,806
Whales, dolphins -

69
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,810
, And any day in the sea.

70
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:09,005
The first time I knew that the nearby
singing blue whale -

71
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:13,614
This song screen,
but I heard it.

72
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,209
What to do? The song must be speeded up.

73
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,133
Niskavillat rise up even more.

74
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,411
Pretty damn great!

75
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:39,370
When we listen to the sounds of
from all over the globe...

76
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:45,682
Whether
frozen Arctic Ocean -

77
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,964
Or the Central African jungle -

78
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,489
Whole world sing.

79
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:58,650
Clicks on,
screech, whistle, jyskettä.

80
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:01,653
We only stopped to listen.

81
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:14,854
Cornell bioakustisen laboratory
animal sound storage is the largest in the world.

82
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:19,618
Votes have been collected since the 1930s.

83
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,646
It's like a museum. On the walls could be
bird skins or beetles.

84
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:33,259
Stock is the sounds of the world's biggest
animals votes -

85
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,651
Smallest insect sounds.

86
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:46,405
This is
male oun singing Kauailta.

87
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:55,062
Out mate for life. The male
singing duets with their partner.

88
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,651
This singing male.
It does not respond.

89
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:05,101
The male continues.

90
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:13,420
In the last of its kind in the male singing
females, which never comes.

91
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,488
The male is all alone.

92
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:24,013
Now the noise has stopped.

93
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:31,528
Collection short lifetime,
a period of about 70 years -

94
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:36,614
Many recorded
species are extinct.

95
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:40,851
Sound Inventory is living proof -

96
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:45,247
Extinction fierce pace.

97
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,813
In the history has been made
five major extinction:

98
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:04,656
Ordovikikaudella,
Devonian -

99
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,936
Permikaudella  -

100
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,648
Trias and / Jurassic.

101
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:16,412
Chalk / Tertiary destroyed
killed the dinosaurs.

102
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:21,657
The deep perception of time
is very difficult.

103
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,890
Earth's history
comprising 4.6 billion years.

104
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,975
If the Earth's history
seal least 24 hours -

105
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:35,053
When a person comes into the picture?

106
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,252
Was only a few seconds before midnight.

107
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,894
We are a new entrant.

108
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:46,855
We are currently anthropocene,
a new era.

109
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,944
Antropos means
people's time.

110
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:57,656
People leave their mark on
impact on the future of the fossil record.

111
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:04,413
65 million years ago an asteroid hit
-

112
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:07,049
And caused the dinosaur extinction.

113
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,615
September the sixth extinction
is easy to name.

114
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,257
Mankind has a new asteroid.

115
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:29,217
This is a turning point,
whereby it is either too late -

116
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,009
Or popular movement gets started.

117
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:40,898
We knew
the Hump restaurant sold whale meat.

118
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,372
At issue is something isompaakin.

119
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:51,532
We heard about the Obama administration
negotiating with the Japanese -

120
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,736
Commercial whaling
initiation of a review.

121
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,813
If we could prove -

122
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:01,734
The endangered whales served in the US Coast -

123
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,236
Negotiations would end short.

124
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:07,995
12 November 2010
Four days after ravintolaratsian

125
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,690
Animal rights organizations intervened
-

126
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:14,197
But the restaurant did not close its doors.

127
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:20,598
There were Ady Gil,
which I had not heard before.

128
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,458
He brought kamansa in front of the restaurant,
and guests saw them.

129
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,977
What are you doing?
Es my mind.

130
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:33,048
Yesterday there was 200 people
demonstrating.

131
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:36,657
I thought that someone must continue to exert pressure
.

132
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:41,859
Ady screens and projections
sees Oscar and Golden Globe Award Gala.

133
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:46,221
He parked the Ferrari
minivan next.

134
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:50,418
The owner came out to ask how long the
Ady will continue.

135
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,903
He held me hippinä,
which would continue a day or two.

136
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,744
I said I will continue to
months or even years.

137
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,941
"How long will you survive my presence?"

138
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:05,253
Restaurant closed its doors
10 days later.

139
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,656
It was a great moment.

140
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:15,859
All the others had gone home.
One man held the spotlight.

141
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:36,627
There are thousands of people -

142
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:41,712
Who will do everything to save the species.

143
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:50,349
They go to the Earth's darkest,
to insecure corners.

144
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:56,870
In the past decade has died
more than 800 environmental activists.

145
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:03,114
They make tough ropes
and are not well-known names.

146
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:09,350
Shawn Heinrichs. Colorado Boulder
is so inside the country as can be.

147
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:15,867
I heard that pretty neighbor
live in an ocean activist -

148
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,986
Who gave up work
technology in the enterprise -

149
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:22,182
Order to save endangered species.

150
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:28,583
Shawn doing pioneering work.

151
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:36,071
Isla Mujeres was the east coast of Mexico
's largest shark fishing island.

152
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:41,551
From there, set off at least
20 shark fishing platform on a daily basis.

153
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:47,390
Shawn help the island was
haituristien top destination.

154
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:53,034
Now the former hainpyytäjät
earn much more -

155
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:58,067
By taking tourists to swim with the whale sharks.

156
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:02,228
Simple economics.

157
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:08,547
Shawn's partner is often
investigative photojournalist Paul Hilton.

158
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:11,668
They end up always
dangerous situations.

159
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:18,432
Paul is a photo journalist. He, too,
focus on endangered species.

160
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:20,666
He has a great work.

161
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:27,115
Paul and Shawn are trying to catch
the endangered species selling rinkejä.

162
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,871
Making it a place in the package.

163
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:32,911
Shawn is a great eager.

164
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:37,554
He speaks gigs always too much
and I have to restrain him.

165
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,227
Americanism shine through.

166
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,669
A couple is a joy in many situations.

167
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:52,033
I may forget to describe something -

168
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,516
No one Watch my back.

169
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:58,989
, Paul and Shawn has a habit of
onto the camera around your neck.

170
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:02,917
Many imagine that the camera needs to look describing
-

171
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:06,356
But it's a video camera,
which describes all the time.

172
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:11,836
What a lot of these!
Are these jaws?

173
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:14,156
Jaws...

174
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:17,075
Do not overdo it.

175
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:23,828
How did you find the place? -Facebookin,
Colleagues and friends to help.

176
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,715
In walks a negligently.

177
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,392
How long were you there?
- 10 - 15 minutes.

178
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:33,670
Picture Then all of this in that time.

179
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:39,398
Are we soon be there?
-It's In the next block.

180
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:43,993
I did not know the illegal wildlife trade
to be so open.

181
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:51,875
Every second shop
was endangered animals.

182
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:59,637
Not only shark fins
but all possible endangered.

183
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,361
When the demand for shark fin soup in China rose
-

184
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:12,034
Daily asked
estimated 250,000 sharks due to the fin.

185
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:19,236
Hai may be the best type of
to describe the situation of the oceans.

186
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,275
Haiti from the period before the dinosaurs.

187
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:25,388
They have survived
four Holocaust.

188
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:33,798
Stocks of sharks has declined 90 per cent
in my generation.

189
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:42,275
I followed in Indonesia evänpyytäjiä,
which were transferred from the camp to the other.

190
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:48,921
One morning
shallow coral reefs reflected something.

191
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,227
The sight was horrible.

192
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,444
Beautiful ruosteviiksihai,
which the fins were cut off.

193
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:06,627
It tried to swim but could not.
It was heartbreaking.

194
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:10,115
This is a fact which no one realizing.

195
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:24,644
Behind, about 200 meters away,
is the biggest evänkäsittelylaitos.

196
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,551
I called one type.

197
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,397
Can we get inside the factory?
-I Have contact.

198
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:35,638
Shawn has an interpreter.

199
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:42,153
He has covered work in China
decades.

200
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:48,156
First, he took us to a place,
which they reached for the first time.

201
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:52,308
It was like a Hong Kong
supermarket endangered species.

202
00:19:55,735 --> 00:20:01,352
Me and Paul have done a lot of work
get to the factory.

203
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:04,872
We have received
only our feet in the door.

204
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:10,919
Hello! Why are you still here?
I told the filming!

205
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,754
The staff pushing us out of
and threatened to call the cops.

206
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:19,463
Hands, Machete...
We were kicked out.

207
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:30,234
According
I took a couple of colleagues Hump-raid.

208
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,800
Heather Rally
makes us a cover job.

209
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:36,628
Charles Hambleton
lead to mask my mission.

210
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:43,120
We came up with the cover story. We put ourselves
kulinaristimatkalla.

211
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,193
We are looking for exotic products.

212
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:51,124
We are gourmets study visit.
We take pictures of food.

213
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:56,434
With buttonhole camera
may have to rat trap in China.

214
00:20:56,545 --> 00:21:02,758
If you come up against the authorities,
tear off all the equipment.

215
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:05,436
Let's go in!

216
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,640
What business
you are practicing marine living?

217
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:31,478
We base our company,
which sells seafood. -As?

218
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:38,277
We Conversely, sold tuna,
marlin and swordfish.

219
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:41,117
They want to see something exciting.

220
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,286
Aasialaisturistit are a big target group, more than 50 per cent.

221
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:53,078
Should we leave?
-Tulkaa Only. I will present locations.

222
00:21:57,381 --> 00:22:00,283
A great entrance.

223
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:08,206
Should go to the toilet. Thanks.

224
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:19,201
Hain Begging is difficult.

225
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,564
If it is successful,
shark each part can be sold.

226
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:27,038
We do not throw away
a single piece of meat.

227
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:31,887
Many ekoihmiset
realize our right.

228
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:40,364
They think that we fin
and leave the shark to sink into the pain.

229
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,522
That's not true.

230
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:46,127
This video has been made by ekoihmisten.

231
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:52,403
This is the worm.
It is very expensive.

232
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:56,443
Price per kilogram is $ 44800.

233
00:22:56,747 --> 00:23:02,805
Of $ 44800,
but it is the wholesale price.

234
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:07,678
They believe that it improves
cancer.

235
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:10,601
The Chinese have a lot of beliefs.

236
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:16,642
We ended up with another
hongkongilaisvarastoon.

237
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,650
Evia were guaranteed 10 - 20000.

238
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:26,517
The plant was one of the largest in the world.

239
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:31,638
It was insanely big.
I have not seen anything like it.

240
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:34,924
Jesus...

241
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:46,243
The world is a crazy place.

242
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:29,884
I remember diving trip to the Galapagos
northernmost islands.

243
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,965
Darwin and Wolf islands are,
where Darwin was not the case.

244
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:43,804
It is a place BC,
before human arrival.

245
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:54,875
A huge whale shark swam up to me,
and followed by dolphins.

246
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:58,168
It was a film camera time.

247
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,195
The screen was filled with animals.

248
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:09,970
Dolphin circled in front of the whale shark, the tuna was caught
-

249
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:16,009
Brought it to me, shook it
and swallowed its tail above.

250
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:21,688
It was a moment when I wished that
36-exposure roll of 37 images.

251
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:27,045
It was magical.

252
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:33,205
Underwater photographer,
or photojournalists -

253
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:38,442
Document the time and place -

254
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:42,607
Which is not in the future may not exist.

255
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:45,880
The clock is ticking.

256
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:52,077
When I described the "National Geographic"
for the first time in 1960, -

257
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:59,166
I took seven or eight squares
6 x 6 Ektachrome film.

258
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:06,685
Connector them together, and I made my first
color panoramic photo of reefs.

259
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:13,164
When I returned to the scene in 1989,
beautiful reef was gone.

260
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:18,882
Often contribute to the extinction of the human toimet-

261
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:22,847
Such as the destruction of the habitat
or overfishing.

262
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:27,245
Then there is global climate change.

263
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:32,640
It is, therefore, the human direct actions -

264
00:26:33,636 --> 00:26:37,332
And indirect actions
climate change in the form.

265
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:42,846
The oceans regulate the climate.
The oceans are the boss.

266
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,001
Now, the oceans are slow to change.

267
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,169
It is a threat to the modern era.

268
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:56,365
Environmental Change
to promote joukkosukupuuttoa.

269
00:26:56,474 --> 00:27:00,963
We are changing the environment in such a manner exactly
-

270
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:03,849
That can trigger a disaster.

271
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,325
Joukkosukupuuttoja has occurred
five. The reasons are varied.

272
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,203
All have been
one thing in common:

273
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:20,771
A huge increase in the amount of carbon dioxide.

274
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:26,207
Current carbon dioxide spike
is the largest in history.

275
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:30,967
We burn fossil fuels -

276
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:35,455
Which has accumulated hundreds of millions of years.

277
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,209
Translate geological history
direction of travel of a blazing pace.

278
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:50,851
Gulf of Mexico oil accident year
about 4.9 million barrels of oil.

279
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:56,607
It is a quarter of the quantity of oil,
which the USA is used on a daily basis.

280
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:05,524
Gulf of Mexico accident was US
of history's worst environmental disaster.

281
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:12,250
It is nothing alongside the devastation
that we achieve every day.

282
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:17,924
I have the worst culprit.

283
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:21,729
Shooting is the worst,
things you can do to the environment.

284
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:25,932
We estimate two years of filming
carbon footprint.

285
00:28:26,027 --> 00:28:33,007
Horrified it,
how much energy consuming job.

286
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:39,448
We are making our lives even better
ourselves thinking -

287
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,721
But we do it at the expense of the future.

288
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:50,491
The problem can be solved in many ways.

289
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,970
We living what we fast enough?

290
00:28:57,033 --> 00:29:00,294
Homma has gone out of control.

291
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,931
The chemical composition of the seas
becomes frighteningly fast.

292
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,055
When we
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it stays there.

293
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,807
One-third or even half of
is absorbed by the oceans.

294
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,524
Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid with water.

295
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:24,856
Sea acidified year by year.

296
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:33,172
If you want to know what it causes,
drop the shell etikkalasiin.

297
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:41,053
Numerous species can -

298
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:46,532
Simply dissolve in the human acidifying the sea.

299
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:49,851
Northwest Pacific Ocean

300
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,487
Mass Death has already begun in the seas.

301
00:29:57,277 --> 00:30:00,051
It is well under way.

302
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:06,451
Are those maggots?
Those brown stains.

303
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:12,332
We collect annually
7 to 10 billion osterintoukkaa.

304
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:15,456
Send them to breeders
northwestern Pacific Ocean.

305
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:22,208
I remember the day when all
toukkamme were bottom of the tanks.

306
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,489
Six billion larvae
died in one day.

307
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:36,889
Washington and Oregon represent
deep seawater flowing breeding -

308
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:39,527
And oysters
unable to increase its bark.

309
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:42,445
The shell dissolves more quickly than
grow.

310
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:49,804
It seems kind of crazy to think
that the sea can be so sour.

311
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:54,815
It seems the future Threat
and current problems.

312
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:59,089
Change in the rate of Mer -

313
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:02,810
And the change it causes food chain
-

314
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,645
Is dramatic and takes place
in our lifetime.

315
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:10,919
Some foods are no longer available -

316
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,127
And we may need to eat
even jellyfish.

317
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,570
It will be a new trend.

318
00:31:23,192 --> 00:31:28,526
It sounds funny that
diet change would save the planet -

319
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:34,803
But if people undertake now
vegetarians, the change would be enormous.

320
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:43,165
Contribute to the extinction of most is
destroying habitats -

321
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,569
Or we will apply
in order to get food.

322
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:51,125
What's more, we use
meat, milk and eggs -

323
00:31:51,231 --> 00:31:55,166
Generates increased
carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

324
00:31:56,788 --> 00:32:03,045
Livestock and all ruminants
produce methane -

325
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:09,164
Hay and other food digestion
-product.

326
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:17,646
Contractions push the gas out of the abdomen.

327
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:22,565
The gas passes through here.
-And We collect the bag.

328
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:26,920
How long will the bag is collected gas?
-just Two hours.

329
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:33,169
Methane impact on climate change
is a 22-fold -

330
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:37,767
Compared to carbon dioxide, so
even a small amount of methane affected.

331
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:45,171
Cow to fill a 200-liter garbage bags
methane every day.

332
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:50,210
One cow is not a problem, but they must
1.5 billion.

333
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:54,128
Very inefficient food production.

334
00:32:56,718 --> 00:33:00,933
75 percent of cropland is
is used to feed livestock.

335
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:06,484
Land cleared for livestock pastures,
for the food and transporting.

336
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:09,289
Cattle
cause more greenhouse gases -

337
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:13,249
As the transport sector in total.

338
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:19,451
There is one problem is not another bigger.
The same is like asking -

339
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,010
Whether global warming worse
as ocean acidification -

340
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:27,680
Or large fish fishing
worse than the pollution of the sea.

341
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:33,571
It would be silly
solve only one problem.

342
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,811
Contact to solve all of them.

343
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,080
Illegal animal market
Guangzhou, China

344
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,373
Rodents.

345
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,406
Home Cats.

346
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:59,007
That's still alive.

347
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,850
The doors will be closed.
Lights go out.

348
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:08,325
Frightening. We do not welcome.

349
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:13,332
The Board of Directors closed the
animal markets in southern China in 2002.

350
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:19,527
Trade began to visit
secretly in the early hours. Horrible thing.

351
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:25,928
Square closed.
-Animals Hidden.

352
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:30,611
Oh my God!

353
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:35,048
This market changed seats twice
within a year.

354
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:40,808
They know it to be wrong.

355
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:53,578
What is dangerous and illegal,
it syrjempään activity is hidden.

356
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:03,289
I'll show you one thing, Louie.

357
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:08,890
Bags must
ten giant manta rays.

358
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,880
Ray gets one chick
every couple of years.

359
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:26,449
A few years ago
streets began to appear stingrays -

360
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:31,523
Areas, which were sold before the sharks.

361
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:35,219
Stingrays can not make shark fin soup
-

362
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:38,727
And their meat is tangy tasting.

363
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:43,170
Why heavy stingrays
being dragged countries?

364
00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:50,452
I did not believe my eyes,
when I saw a long line of big stingrays.

365
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:56,083
I was wondering what it is about. Thus,
How to Skates and rays cut from the gills.

366
00:35:56,193 --> 00:36:00,288
Gills is removed.
Where do they leave?

367
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:07,331
It turned out that it was a folk medicine
South China coastal city -

368
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:09,366
More than 50 years ago.

369
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:14,773
The drug was somewhat lost,
but after the outbreak of SARS -

370
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,486
Someone came up with,
that sharks are running out.

371
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:20,577
What else can we offer?

372
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:24,491
Administration published
years ago in a book -

373
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:29,058
Chinese medicine
use of animals.

374
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,700
It was told how to skate
gills can be treated diseases.

375
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:38,087
Gills ended
Chinese shops -

376
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,770
With the sale of medicines
or dried seafood.

377
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,927
Gills were believed to improve blood circulation
, treating bruises and vammat-

378
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:49,484
Healing and cancer.

379
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,175
Deviated folklore.

380
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:20,759
I'll never forget the first
my encounter with the skate.

381
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:28,443
I sat in the water, the ray
suddenly swam over me.

382
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,764
It disappeared on their way.

383
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,561
I was left gasping for breath.

384
00:37:42,824 --> 00:37:49,081
Some time ago we were in Bali.
The end of the last dive -

385
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:56,370
Rays swim beneath and missed
place five meters.

386
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:59,846
I wonder why it did not move.

387
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:08,320
In the body fluttered fishing line.

388
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:14,763
I swam over to it and switch to the line
above the hook.

389
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:24,558
I swam to the surface.

390
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:30,762
It did not go off
but remained below me.

391
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:43,525
I went back over to its
and stretched out my hand toward the hook.

392
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:49,088
I took off the hook slowly
of its upper jaw.

393
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:57,562
That's it.
I thought it would leave on their way.

394
00:38:57,678 --> 00:39:00,487
It circled beneath my feet.

395
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:07,172
I returned once more to join
and I put my hand next to a wound site.

396
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,806
I patted it like to speak,
that there is nothing to worry about.

397
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:19,529
I put my head next to the eye.
Its eyes moved back and forth.

398
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:26,483
It knew that I was trying to help.

399
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:39,810
People often ask,
what one person can do.

400
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:43,813
What if you could see how
shark fin soup is done?

401
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:51,409
If you could see how 70 million sharks are killed because of
soup each year?

402
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:53,440
Would you eat the soup yet?

403
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:58,011
I gave the footage in Indonesia
what I saw the shark Wild mother -

404
00:39:58,117 --> 00:40:01,171
To protect sharks in China.

405
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:03,936
More than a billion people saw the film.

406
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:08,520
Of them, 80 percent said
vacating shark fin soup -

407
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:11,363
Or reduce the eating
a minimum.

408
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:15,447
When buying stops, the killing can end
.

409
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,691
Still portraying this image of power.
It made a difference.

410
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,647
Need to take care of future generations
's in our genes.

411
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:40,562
If we find the right bus -

412
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,763
Reach people in an instant.

413
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,655
We will change them.

414
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:53,400
The human eye sees a small strip
electromagnetic spectrum.

415
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:58,370
Like home would be a grand piano,
but hear only one note.

416
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,440
The human eye does not see carbon dioxide.

417
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:09,211
Carbon dioxide and methane absorb infrared
certain wavelengths.

418
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,294
This camera has a color filter -

419
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:18,331
Which allow us to see from the nose and mouth
future carbon dioxide.

420
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:26,124
We have two cameras.
One camera sees the same as the eye.

421
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,614
Another what fossiilipolttoaine-
companies do not want people to see.

422
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:33,568
Carbon World.

423
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,767
Horrific but beautiful.

424
00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:56,606
Turn left.
Dial to the left? Slowly.

425
00:42:10,644 --> 00:42:14,739
About all we do
cause carbon dioxide emissions.

426
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:17,966
Houses the heating and air conditioning -

427
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:22,935
Passage of airplanes, trains and cars.

428
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,328
All produce huge amounts of carbon dioxide.

429
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,728
You can not see.

430
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,490
Secret world Seeing
seemed like a magic trick disclosure.

431
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:44,370
Magic trick that will kill the planet.

432
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:50,610
Like a big parade's trash.
-Save.

433
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:05,570
What are doing?
-I show. Translate from evidence.

434
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:08,573
The camera shoots carbon dioxide.

435
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:13,854
Government commissioned or your own project?
-My Science project.

436
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:29,168
Our generation is the last
a hand to twist the throttle lever.

437
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:36,135
atmosphere so much carbon dioxide and methane
-

438
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:42,892
The baby boomers generation
may well be -

439
00:43:43,004 --> 00:43:47,572
The most important mammal generation
Earth's history.

440
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:53,899
During Antroposeenin everything changes.

441
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:59,094
Earth's geology,
chemical composition of the oceans.

442
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:05,376
Antropos means that the country
ball's fate is in our own hands.

443
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:17,486
When you take a drop of ocean water
and looks at it under a microscope -

444
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:23,055
It contains a huge amount of
beauty, pienoisarkkitehtuuria -

445
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:25,581
A view I will never tire of.

446
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:32,569
Boris Worm published important
controversial writings -

447
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:35,977
Reduction in phytoplankton.

448
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:40,694
When I speak of plankton, I call on the first
pull twice persons.

449
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,858
The second breath
comes from the sea.

450
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:48,739
Phytoplankton produce half of the oxygen we breathe
.

451
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:56,459
Man sea change in many ways -

452
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:59,811
Fishing on climate change and acidification.

453
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,329
No part of the sea is not left
from human activities.

454
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:08,126
Satellite images and research data on the basis of
-

455
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:12,370
Worm fell that we have completed
lose 40% of the phytoplankton -

456
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:14,286
During the last 50 years.

457
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:18,616
It is mainly the result of climate change.

458
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,415
It's a big thing,
which involves a lot of controversy.

459
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:26,576
If the plankton will be reduced so dramatically as we believe -

460
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:29,094
It is a big deal.

461
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,177
Our lives are dependent on the oceans
breathe.

462
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,449
Animals were able to live on land only after
-

463
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:46,495
The marine plankton was produced by
enough oxygen for them to live on.

464
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:57,141
Imagine that
the big environmental issues are important.

465
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:04,537
But if we lose the small things,
all else fails.

466
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,857
We have a fabulous tangle with
all of which are connected to each other.

467
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:40,381
If you remove one small part of
even plankton -

468
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:44,376
Whole tangle of collapse.

469
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:50,607
Like to listen to the symphony -

470
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:59,343
Where the orchestra is removed
player at a time.

471
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,060
Even the sounds of the past.

472
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,703
And then it's gone.

473
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:34,228
Most of the world is fighting for the preservation of the species
-

474
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,310
, And he will destroy
, at least 600 individuals a year.

475
00:47:38,419 --> 00:47:40,269
That's treatment.

476
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:45,903
Paul found a man,
who smuggle endangered sharks.

477
00:47:46,015 --> 00:47:51,431
Basking shark and whale sharks
.

478
00:47:51,531 --> 00:47:56,309
We can get to rub shops
omega 3 oils.

479
00:47:56,414 --> 00:48:01,864
What should I know about fish oil?
-We Want to ensure the quality.

480
00:48:01,974 --> 00:48:08,749
Ask for samples. -I Am angry
and pushy. You calming.

481
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:13,150
We are from Brooklyn by hand.
-You Decide on the place itself.

482
00:48:15,378 --> 00:48:18,306
Haiöljystä made
omega 3 products, -

483
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:21,272
But these sharks are threatened with extinction -

484
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:24,431
And are protected by
China and elsewhere.

485
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:29,876
CITES is the only law,
that protects endangered species.

486
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:33,594
Meeting decides
Trade in Endangered Species.

487
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,385
The menu is only a few hundred animals.

488
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:44,303
It is partly explained by the fact that the
people who päättävät-

489
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:49,432
Selling living animals.

490
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:53,507
... A new decision-making body,
which is developing the system -

491
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:57,753
International trade in ivory
to start after the break.

492
00:49:19,094 --> 00:49:24,509
The economy has been in the doldrums
and interested people few and far between.

493
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:27,271
Mr. Sawyer is interested.

494
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,512
He said that the basking shark oil
is the highest quality.

495
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:38,629
Will we, the small sample?

496
00:49:38,744 --> 00:49:44,079
Recently I received a small amount.
-I My people not tested it.

497
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:48,037
I am using their own lab.

498
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:56,197
Vien Louie aside for the moment.

499
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:59,954
Asked with just a...

500
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:05,423
Replace button Up button closed.
Microphone and tape are displayed.

501
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,392
Oh, Jesus...

502
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:11,193
Did he see it?
-I do not know.

503
00:50:22,055 --> 00:50:27,828
After all, five years, say,
that fished all whale sharks?

504
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:31,389
In this area is the future,
that's for sure.

505
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:37,355
Now we sell
ten metric tons to Italy every year.

506
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:39,269
Shark Meat.

507
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:48,347
Smuggle shark meat
out of the country.

508
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,350
I can show you.

509
00:50:57,101 --> 00:51:01,556
One hundred percent whale sharks.

510
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,831
We went to look at the processing plant.

511
00:51:08,656 --> 00:51:12,280
Flooring was a whale shark fragments.

512
00:51:12,374 --> 00:51:14,988
We started to describe.

513
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,275
We published a global press release.

514
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:32,559
Story captured the National Geographic,
Time, BBC, all possible media.

515
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:39,356
Chinese administration takes a lot of work
for the benefit of endangered species.

516
00:51:39,457 --> 00:51:41,196
Ivory burned -

517
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:45,311
Official banquets
does not offer shark fin soup.

518
00:51:45,414 --> 00:51:48,152
Things are going in the right direction.

519
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:57,630
I hope that they will go to stop the action
Mr. Lee.

520
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,592
Pahaltahan it seems, but the
end of the tunnel may be light.

521
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:09,638
People change. The direction is the right one.
Do not be so depressed.

522
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,638
If things change a little bit
our lifetime, this is worth.

523
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:20,964
It is easy to point an accusing finger at China
.

524
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:25,651
It destroys the earth, contaminates
and kill the species from extinction.

525
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:29,732
Equally, the West makes the splendor of the work -

526
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:36,352
Damage the environment and destroy endangered species.

527
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:44,005
China is experiencing similar growing pains
as we aikoinamme.

528
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:48,796
Our growing pains
time on Earth was one billion people.

529
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:54,081
Now China alone has 1.3 billion people.

530
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,799
We've driven many species to the brink of
and the destruction of the environment.

531
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:07,793
We can not afford
repeat the same mistakes -

532
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,667
Because soon there is nothing left.

533
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:21,673
The container has
rare amphibians.

534
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:29,721
More than half of amphibian species could disappear over the
next 20 years.

535
00:53:30,616 --> 00:53:36,675
Frog species reside 7000.
All of them are endangered.

536
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:42,083
PhotoArk is my business to describe
all living species in captivity.

537
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:47,556
It is one man's desperate
attempt to get people to forward.

538
00:53:48,622 --> 00:53:53,955
There it is.
Our final Ecnomiohyla rabborum -lehtisammakko.

539
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:57,278
The fungus killed them in Panama.
It is the last of its kind.

540
00:53:57,379 --> 00:54:00,521
As a result, the species will become extinct.

541
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:04,399
You lift the chin a little bit?
Well done.

542
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:07,636
This is a great moment.

543
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:15,558
Many animals get my help, nation-wide visibility
before the extinction.

544
00:54:15,664 --> 00:54:18,160
This is their last opportunity.

545
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,995
I hope that PhotoArk work
only as an archive of lost animals.

546
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:30,526
I hope that people will be attracted
and fall in love with these animals.

547
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:39,395
Turtle species is only 330 - 340.
Half of them are endangered.

548
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:48,394
If the Earth's temperature rises even slightly
-

549
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:50,920
Them are threatened with extinction.

550
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,602
This is a last resort.

551
00:54:56,706 --> 00:55:02,007
Keeping
endangered animals in captivity.

552
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:06,923
Such an animal or wildlife in general -

553
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:10,114
Can compare the world's finest works of art.

554
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:15,152
It outperforms by Picasso, Matisse and Warhol
even the best works.

555
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:24,475
Life wants to flourish.
DNA wants to continue.

556
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:27,284
We have to be part of it.

557
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:35,362
Why would we want to destroy the thing, which
evolution took billions of years?

558
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:48,302
Trees fall into the lake -

559
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:52,633
Because the permafrost is melting.

560
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:59,581
Earth's Arctic regions
below the lakes and oceans -

561
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:04,318
Massive amounts of frozen methane.

562
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:06,877
It has been there for millions of years.

563
00:56:08,193 --> 00:56:11,967
This is bubbling in the lake
a lot of methane.

564
00:56:12,062 --> 00:56:14,923
Bubbles can be set on fire.

565
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:19,512
The pupils are aware of the destruction,
that killed the dinosaurs.

566
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:25,241
Paleontologists investigating
permikauden destruction.

567
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:30,399
It is the worst of earth's history, destroyed,
which destroyed almost all life.

568
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:35,998
It's called a big death.

569
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:41,764
The meteor caused the Cretaceous-destruction -

570
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:46,879
But what killed
land and sea animals permikaudella?

571
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:54,168
Now begins, it seems that the culprit was
methane.

572
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:03,356
The Arctic region is warming up. Methane
has been under the ice for millions of years.

573
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:05,364
It's starting to emerge.

574
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:13,802
When the process starts,
the effect is uncontrolled.

575
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:18,838
Unmanaged climate change,
which can not be stopped.

576
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:28,901
Methane problem can only control
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

577
00:57:29,026 --> 00:57:32,885
They warm the Arctic
and release methane.

578
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:43,359
Oil companies like ice melting
opportunity to drill more holes.

579
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:47,082
We do not realize, that the
under the ice lurking threat.

580
00:57:48,226 --> 00:57:53,889
Rapid climate change
was even before humanity arise.

581
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:58,524
They did not go for millions of years
but three to four years.

582
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:03,679
Payment of the Mortgage will take longer.
Children's college will take longer.

583
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:08,116
What if the temperature rises
about three degrees in three years?

584
00:58:09,145 --> 00:58:12,996
As a result, the oceans will die.

585
00:58:13,106 --> 00:58:19,239
When the oceans begin to die, the Earth
can not conduct business as usual.

586
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:25,082
When that happens, all life dies.

587
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,758
This is a mass.

588
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:54,049
Indonesia is one of the most remote island.

589
00:58:54,147 --> 00:58:58,647
It is located at the point where the sea
becomes narrow canals.

590
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:03,567
Whales, dolphins and all kinds of
animals pass down the aisle.

591
00:59:07,634 --> 00:59:10,407
End of the island is
village called Lama Kera.

592
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:16,720
In the world there is no other seats -

593
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:21,043
Which killed as many stingrays
than that in one village.

594
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:30,242
Rauskuongelma had to solve
skull's seat.

595
00:59:32,956 --> 00:59:35,089
Manta rays.

596
00:59:35,191 --> 00:59:39,403
The package is 20 - 40.
The package costs about $ 20.

597
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:42,324
One gets a pair of skates package.

598
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:45,492
Gills get 500 - $ 600.

599
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:49,243
There's gills.

600
00:59:49,344 --> 00:59:55,488
Cartilage is sent to China,
where they are crushed pills.

601
00:59:56,427 --> 01:00:01,369
Glyseriinisulfaattitabletteja view of joint pain.

602
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:06,126
We met the master.

603
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:13,494
Fishermen believe that the coming
prohibit rauskunkalastuksen.

604
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:19,280
If you came Lamakeraan
animal protection matters -

605
01:00:19,397 --> 01:00:24,616
Community hopes that you offer
alternative solutions.

606
01:00:25,428 --> 01:00:32,762
Rauskunkalastus is the main source of income,
which we pay for our children's education.

607
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:39,721
We can not engage in agriculture.
We can not grow anything.

608
01:00:42,157 --> 01:00:45,929
They did not take us
warmly received.

609
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:52,162
We had talked ourselves
fishing vessel.

610
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:01,608
Ask them how they got the skate.

611
01:01:14,072 --> 01:01:20,526
After a couple of hours trip
reflected on the surface of the black character.

612
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,297
The blood colored the water.

613
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,409
Ray was fighting killed
hours.

614
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:28,572
I watched it and wondered
I can not watch.

615
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:34,169
He hit the skate blade to the brain.

616
01:02:40,117 --> 01:02:45,410
Its soul disappeared before my eyes
and its body went limp.

617
01:02:55,512 --> 01:02:59,893
Come on, Paul. There is nothing to panic.

618
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:10,769
When we returned to the village,
drove past us many boats.

619
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:18,811
Boats surrounded the rauskuparven,
villagers who had come to the field.

620
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:35,135
They began to beat off the gills.

621
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:43,773
Merchants offered to them
diesel engines -

622
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,423
And to the sales chain in China -

623
01:03:47,627 --> 01:03:51,840
And the village developed into a powerful business enterprise.

624
01:03:55,942 --> 01:03:59,538
Manta rays disappear in a few years.

625
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,246
They know that the rays are reduced.

626
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:13,731
They tajuaisivat without us,
that change is needed.

627
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,331
What their children are doing?

628
01:04:22,594 --> 01:04:24,412
There's nothing left.

629
01:04:32,762 --> 01:04:39,052
A touch of magic will disappear.
Without these species in the world is empty.

630
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:01,496
200 years from now -

631
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:07,208
Sounding out people this period -

632
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:11,609
And are wondering how to
this time people-

633
01:05:11,722 --> 01:05:16,576
Gave their
magnificent animals disappear.

634
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:29,372
I or anyone else is in vain to save
unspoiled places -

635
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:34,017
If people are not taught to be better stewards
-

636
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:36,661
Than we have been.

637
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:47,612
If we lose hope,
hope is lost.

638
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,458
Without hope, people will sink into apathy.

639
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:57,889
Things that are worth fighting
is still a lot.

640
01:06:02,445 --> 01:06:08,096
Chinese River Dolphin was disappearing
twenty years ago.

641
01:06:08,203 --> 01:06:10,497
They had left a few hundred.

642
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:15,656
I thought that someone is doing something to save eläimet-

643
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:20,530
Who had both of its kind
sect that last.

644
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:26,536
Surely someone, somewhere, to save them!
It is mandatory that they do not die out.

645
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:32,287
Now they are gone. They died
extinct in my lifetime.

646
01:06:39,845 --> 01:06:45,254
Always think that someone else
to save endangered species.

647
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:57,299
Protected Kissimmee Prairie region

648
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:02,576
This field is one of the last places,
where you can see heinäsirkkusen.

649
01:07:03,205 --> 01:07:06,658
Sing in males is
from year to year less.

650
01:07:06,764 --> 01:07:10,501
We now
sirkkusta about 20 years.

651
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:16,497
Before the 150, now 20.
Finding Sirkkunen more difficult.

652
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:21,100
Did you hear?
-That Is heinäsirkkunen.

653
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,059
Zoos spoken
phasing out.

654
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,981
When a species is no longer viable
captivity -

655
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,702
It will be removed in stages.

656
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:35,931
Let it sink into extinction.

657
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:40,576
There it is.
-Kiinni Stayed.

658
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:49,019
Elephants, pandas and rhinos
will not be deleted.

659
01:07:49,879 --> 01:07:56,541
But how do people get excited
small, brown bird?

660
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:05,101
Sirkkuskuvani ended
"Audubon" action.

661
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:09,698
When the US Fish and Wildlife agency
saw it -

662
01:08:09,806 --> 01:08:15,218
Heinäsirkkusen
a $ 30,000 annual grant -

663
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:19,130
Rose this year to 1.3 million.

664
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:23,861
Money is carrying out research
and try to turn the stem growth.

665
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:41,493
For me, photography is not intended to
not only to introduce some beauty.

666
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:47,567
It is a weapon.

667
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:56,451
How do you think the Ady Gil got the time
one of the projector.

668
01:08:58,515 --> 01:09:02,056
I wonder how us to extend the pattern.

669
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:10,853
When we see a dream,
we stay within certain limits.

670
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:13,019
In the dream, there are different worlds.

671
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:17,326
Early photographs were round,
as televisions.

672
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:23,213
Media wanted more out of
and it was decided to make a box.

673
01:09:24,882 --> 01:09:27,733
Box determines our way of thinking.

674
01:09:30,193 --> 01:09:35,732
I have always increased the instrument
million parts.

675
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,684
It has become something else.

676
01:09:38,914 --> 01:09:41,534
Grand Mosque United Arab Emirates

677
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:46,338
Sydney Opera House

678
01:09:46,845 --> 01:09:51,061
Travis has made projections
the world's most famous buildings.

679
01:09:51,155 --> 01:09:56,087
My dream is to get the "National Geographic
'photographers pictures -

680
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:59,055
And to bring their message to
a completely different order of magnitude.

681
01:10:01,357 --> 01:10:04,092
The whale could swim in the bypass

682
01:10:04,197 --> 01:10:06,937
And jump to the next building.

683
01:10:07,031 --> 01:10:11,213
Haiti on Wall Street
is a great idea.

684
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:15,571
What do you say?
-Onnistuu.

685
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:21,090
Cities and non-residential buildings
cause 80% of greenhouse gases.

686
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,216
Tony Malkin owns all know,
the Empire State Building.

687
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:31,903
He has made it ecological.
Building in was considered outdated.

688
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:37,776
Renewed the 650 window,
switched to LED lights valoiksi -

689
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:40,698
Renew the heating and cooling systems.

690
01:10:40,795 --> 01:10:45,090
Saving EUR 4.4 million per year.

691
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:51,500
The benefit is the best incentive
eco-friendliness.

692
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:56,817
I would like to project into the woods.

693
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,495
Full rakennusko?
-Yes.

694
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:06,130
We can also draw projectors
moving cars.

695
01:11:07,324 --> 01:11:11,618
Travis drew a picture of the car,
which the projector paid.

696
01:11:11,715 --> 01:11:15,256
Plan opened up entirely new opportunities.

697
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:22,502
Environmental Activists
may not be the only ones -

698
01:11:22,598 --> 01:11:26,333
Who want to get rid of
fossil fuels.

699
01:11:26,442 --> 01:11:28,612
All need to be involved.

700
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,538
I heard on behalf of the environment speaking
racing car drivers.

701
01:11:32,636 --> 01:11:36,176
The sport not traditionally
transmitted to the environment.

702
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:39,209
He proves the claim to be false.

703
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:43,777
When I ask the PR firms
to look for sponsors for myself -

704
01:11:43,877 --> 01:11:48,497
And I did not want to advertise
fossil fuels, oil -

705
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,544
Coal, meat, animal testing
factors, furs, leather -

706
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:57,298
I considered to be wondering.

707
01:11:57,843 --> 01:12:03,699
Leilani Münter overtook five cars
During the one and a half lap.

708
01:12:04,442 --> 01:12:06,543
I have been told -

709
01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:10,373
The correct environmentalist
devout would compete in cycling.

710
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:14,255
When my species is not interested
75 million viewers.

711
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:24,739
Tesla factory in Fremont, California

712
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:28,493
Elon Musk rebuild
rockets used -

713
01:12:28,606 --> 01:12:31,100
Who visit space stations.

714
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,424
She is America's largest
solar cells installer -

715
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:37,380
And he built the world's best
ranked car that is fully electric car.

716
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:41,066
Leilani felt Elon Musks.

717
01:12:41,165 --> 01:12:45,145
The ongoing trial is silly -

718
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:51,418
How much carbon dioxide
marine atmosphere lasts.

719
01:12:51,525 --> 01:12:53,419
In order to get future -

720
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,488
That does not end up environmental disaster
and economic collapse -

721
01:12:58,597 --> 01:13:01,331
As can be seen, if we do not give up on oil -

722
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:03,662
Need for electric vehicles.

723
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:07,494
Hereby order the car to pull.
-Otamme Against it.

724
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:13,381
Obscura Workshop
Oakland, California

725
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:24,899
It's fast.
What about when the weight is 47 pounds?

726
01:13:31,526 --> 01:13:35,698
The focal length is huge.
Image was really far.

727
01:13:35,795 --> 01:13:39,690
It can zoom
even 300 meters away.

728
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:43,893
Hundreds of meters away?
-Yes.

729
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:50,053
How far these projecting?
-1600 Meters.

730
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:54,897
I build you
three times louder machine.

731
01:13:58,766 --> 01:14:04,057
Suddenly a great sound.
Do you not hear it?

732
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:13,225
We were inspired by plankton and cuttlefish -

733
01:14:13,326 --> 01:14:16,861
Communication using light or maastoutumiskeinona
.

734
01:14:16,971 --> 01:14:20,540
We used loistevalomaalia.

735
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:28,180
We can take over to a mobile projector you
, buildings, streets.

736
01:14:28,926 --> 01:14:35,348
We projected carbon dioxide emissions in real time.

737
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:41,304
That is legal,
until you press this button.

738
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:47,984
Is it because legal.
-All Ready, boss.

739
01:14:48,242 --> 01:14:53,136
When we export our natural town -

740
01:14:53,244 --> 01:14:57,944
Inspire hope that people
rescue the animals.

741
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:12,964
Bangkok, Thailand

742
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:18,050
A number of species in need of protection.

743
01:15:18,141 --> 01:15:21,201
Most people do not end up in the protection list.

744
01:15:23,113 --> 01:15:25,491
After four years of campaigning -

745
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:31,683
Brought the giant manta rays
CITES on the agenda in 2013.

746
01:15:31,787 --> 01:15:34,643
I'll show you the video of our work.

747
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:42,085
Hope and inspiration are reportedly
doing for money and policy.

748
01:15:45,595 --> 01:15:48,732
We live in a visual world.

749
01:15:48,828 --> 01:15:51,202
The figures show a lot of strength.

750
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:56,642
The room may be to talk to
fifteen different languages -

751
01:15:56,747 --> 01:15:59,885
But everyone understands
a photo message.

752
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:02,596
"Protection sipped the soup."

753
01:16:02,706 --> 01:16:06,043
That's the hongkongilaiskatto.

754
01:16:06,741 --> 01:16:10,206
Go to the next initiative -

755
01:16:10,306 --> 01:16:14,557
Who would take second annex
paholaisrauskulajit according to the listing.

756
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:20,410
The EU supports the initiative of
giant manta rays inclusion.

757
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:23,920
Also, South Africa supports the initiative.

758
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:28,210
China does not support the initiative.

759
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:34,687
Copy that. Let's get moving.

760
01:16:37,068 --> 01:16:40,324
Is the seat belt catch?
-There is.

761
01:16:43,105 --> 01:16:46,638
Turn right.

762
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,286
Run forward.

763
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:56,964
Good.

764
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:06,803
Why are you up with the car?
-Car On the roof is really light.

765
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:11,080
What image do you suggest?
-Otamme Images in industrial areas.

766
01:17:11,187 --> 01:17:15,002
Why?
-Heijastukset Seem nätimmiltä.

767
01:17:16,872 --> 01:17:20,602
Can we describe the smoke you?
-There Will not smoke.

768
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,963
But what?
Vapor.

769
01:17:23,067 --> 01:17:26,646
Can we describe the höyryänne?
-Ette.

770
01:17:26,985 --> 01:17:34,164
People have to understand that this generation
have to save the animals.

771
01:17:34,834 --> 01:17:38,606
We can not leave the task
future generations.

772
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:41,443
We have to do it.

773
01:17:41,913 --> 01:17:47,286
Matter there is no consensus.
Can I get results displayed?

774
01:18:08,154 --> 01:18:11,963
The only way to bring about change
Lamakeran such as the remoteness of the village -

775
01:18:12,072 --> 01:18:15,768
Is to offer alternatives.

776
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:21,251
When CITES lifted mantas
protection list -

777
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:26,570
Indonesia banned the rauskunpyytämisen
all over the country.

778
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:31,531
Stingrays can not even hurt.
It can get a year in prison.

779
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:34,569
The Act provides new opportunities.

780
01:18:34,672 --> 01:18:37,204
This is our theater.

781
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:42,567
The projector is here where electricity?

782
01:18:43,187 --> 01:18:49,884
Conservation
small world events, opening doors -

783
01:18:49,994 --> 01:18:53,725
Often lead to breakthroughs.

784
01:18:57,671 --> 01:19:01,290
Does it work? It is seen as soon as possible.

785
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:39,082
I am a fisherman.

786
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:45,328
If we continue with the current style,
rays will soon no longer exist.

787
01:19:45,433 --> 01:19:51,447
They may even become extinct.

788
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:55,655
We do not want to happen.

789
01:19:57,553 --> 01:20:00,608
Requests for skates and rays should be limited to
-

790
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:07,129
So that future generations would know what the rays look like.

791
01:20:14,471 --> 01:20:17,121
Lama Kera!

792
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:23,450
We need our village!

793
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:44,972
We want them to see
rays in a new light.

794
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:48,369
They are far more valuable alive.

795
01:20:52,032 --> 01:20:56,322
Changing the fishing culture
turismikulttuuriksi -

796
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,810
Feel scary thought.

797
01:20:59,315 --> 01:21:05,047
We show them success stories elsewhere.

798
01:21:05,242 --> 01:21:09,570
The poor places,
which were to flourish.

799
01:21:18,478 --> 01:21:23,451
The film makes the effect of
children and they are the future mentors.

800
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:32,207
We care about the message that they choose.

801
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:41,336
THIS IS A Antropos,
"THE AGE HUMAN"

802
01:22:12,312 --> 01:22:16,094
We make a difference.

803
01:22:16,194 --> 01:22:20,245
Dying extinction of species
is increasing -

804
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:25,055
So we need more and more
such undaunted souls.

805
01:22:27,597 --> 01:22:32,775
People have to understand
that the fight is worth.

806
01:22:36,761 --> 01:22:43,654
As a result of the small choices can be a world in which we all want.

807
01:22:56,476 --> 01:22:59,213
UN headquarters in New York

808
01:23:14,754 --> 01:23:17,055
THE WORLD SINGING...

809
01:23:23,717 --> 01:23:26,253
BUT WE ARE NOT LISTENING

810
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:20,893
Japan was a pastor,
whose words remained in my mind:

811
01:24:22,277 --> 01:24:27,087
"It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness
."

812
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:35,894
Many people said that the game is lost.
Why is good reason to make the effort?

813
01:24:40,045 --> 01:24:44,339
But as one candle
counts.

814
01:24:46,595 --> 01:24:51,377
Another candle ignited
may find you -

815
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:56,533
And the way
movements originate.

816
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:13,944
The task sounds impossible,
but if you start with one thing -

817
01:25:14,044 --> 01:25:15,618
Movement gets started.

818
01:25:31,321 --> 01:25:35,059
If we do not buy endangered species products
made, they can not sell.

819
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:39,461
Campaign against shark fins in China
decreased demand for the fins of 70%.

820
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:52,138
Deny the endangered
MADE OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS -

821
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:54,257
IN THE US AND ABROAD

822
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:11,100
One  meat free and juustoton day
week for a year in the USA -

823
01:26:11,211 --> 01:26:14,259
Correspond 7600000 The car
elimination of you.

824
01:26:18,003 --> 01:26:21,701
EAT MORE VEGETABLES!

825
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:29,618
CARBON DIOXIDE spike is
HIGHER THAN EVER

826
01:26:32,966 --> 01:26:36,258
Home solar panels
saving fuel -

827
01:26:36,361 --> 01:26:39,532
Driving a car around the side of the Earth
every year.

828
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:44,021
USE ELECTRICITY USE SOLAR POWER

829
01:27:03,643 --> 01:27:06,817
Investing in renewable energy
can turn the state economy to rise.

830
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:09,538
Germany gets 30% of its electricity from renewable energy
.

831
01:27:09,648 --> 01:27:12,543
By 2050
figure is 80%.

832
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:15,335
