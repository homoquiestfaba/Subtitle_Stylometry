2
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,007
I'm sorry, I'm
waiting for someone.

3
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,669
You are.

4
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,178
Uh, under normal
circumstances,

5
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,475
I'd never
turn you away,

6
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,571
but this is a
business meeting.

7
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,173
What kind of
business are you in?

8
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,583
Um, I work in real estate
corporate real estate.

9
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,619
What's your name?

10
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,485
Look, I don't
mean to be rude

11
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,488
I swear if you knew me

12
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,024
I'm the last guy to say no
to a beautiful--

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,923
Wow, you can't even
tell me your name?

14
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,019
<i>- Dennis.
- I don't believe you</i>

15
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,189
<i>- Pardon me?
- Let's start over</i>

16
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:04,099
<i>No, let's not--
I'm not-- Ican't--</i>

17
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:09,334
I, I-- is this like, uh...

18
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,102
You're-- are you a
professional?

19
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,802
A professional what?

20
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,436
- I don't--
- I'll tell you my name.

21
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,310
My name is Driver.

22
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,370
You're kidding me.

23
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,007
No, I don't have a
sense of humor.

24
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,211
- You're Driver?
- Yes.

25
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,584
- Frank didn't mention that--
- I had a vagina?

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,554
It's not his job to talk
about my genitals, Nick.

27
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,354
Jesus.

28
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,757
I don't know how I
feel about this.

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,954
Oh, if it changes
things for you.

30
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,257
Well, yeah, it
changes things

31
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,561
By all means, pay
attention to that.

32
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,158
How do I know for
sure it's you?

33
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,032
You have a dental practice on
Wilshire and Doheny,

34
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,935
you've been married
two and a half years to Karen

35
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,439
second marriage for you

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,372
Your dog is named Hendrix
you drive a Land Cruiser,

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,534
you hired Frank eight
weeks ago.

38
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,838
Okay. Okay.

39
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,706
You're not a cop
are you?

40
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,873
Do I look like a cop?

41
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,712
No.

42
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,809
Frankly you look like a
Playmate of the month

43
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,945
Want to frisk me?

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,216
What?

45
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,189
Do you Want to
pat me down?

46
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,452
Are you messing with me
I can't tell.

47
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,959
I already told you,
I have no sense of humor

48
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,689
- Are you wired?
- What?

49
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,129
Are you wearing a wire right now
recording our conversation?

50
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,257
- Of course not.
- Open your shirt.

51
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,265
Here?

52
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,767
You go to the gym three
times a week,

53
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,767
what's the problem?

54
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,210
My tum.

55
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,108
Jesus Christ, what
are you doing?

56
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,843
It's LA, Nick, nobody notices
some chick lifting her shirt.

57
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:32,016
So how do we, uh...

58
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,250
how does this work?

59
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,417
Frank didn't
walk you through it?

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,618
He said the less I knew
the better

61
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,888
and it'd be done within
the week.

62
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,429
That's pretty much
all there is to it.

63
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,989
If you knew
me, you'd realize

64
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,796
I'm really the most
harmless guy.

65
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,302
We're all pretty harmless
until we're cornered, Nick

66
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,703
Sometimes we find ourselves in
an unbearable situation,

67
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,866
options dry up and we
resort to drastic measures

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,034
It's called survival

69
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,577
I'm not a shrink, I'm not
a priest,

70
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,112
you don't need to justify
yourself to me.

71
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,704
But I'm no idiot,
I realize these things

72
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,180
go south more often
than not

73
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
Well, not exactly more
often than not, but yes

74
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,785
there's always a risk

75
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,548
Thing to remember with
cops regardless of what you read

76
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,146
in detective novels or
watch on TV,

77
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,155
they're pretty dumb

78
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,452
Until they're not

79
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,186
If you feel so strongly
about it,

80
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,694
maybe you
should get up, walk away

81
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,093
and we never had this
conversation.

82
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,529
I'm passed that point

83
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,362
and Frank says you're
the best

84
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,629
Well, I don't like
to brag,

85
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,170
but you're welcome
to ask around.

86
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,068
How did you learn
to do this?

87
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,201
Why, you writing a book?

88
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,746
No, I'm sorry
I'm just--

89
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,474
It helps me to talk
this through.

90
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,106
The less you know about
me, the better all around

91
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,309
Yeah.

92
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,986
I helped liberate Kuwait.

93
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,354
I learned on the job exactly
how to be all that I can be.

94
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,818
Strange world

95
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,626
Safer for you trust me.

96
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,564
How do you mean?

97
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,533
In this line of work, you can't
imagine the amount of guys

98
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,229
who fall for their targets
and then you've bought yourself

99
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,670
a world-class headache.

100
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,831
No kidding?

101
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:56,839
Most men see themselves
as saviors,

102
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,137
they want
to fix things

103
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,677
Main problem between men
and women right there,

104
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,076
women like to talk about
their problems in detail

105
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,478
ad nauseam.

106
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,674
Men just want to fix them

107
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,943
and move onto
something more stimulating.

108
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,952
- Yeah.
- Like blow jobs, sure.

109
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,715
Why did you
say that out loud?

110
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,018
A lot of guys don't
have the ovaries for this job

111
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,990
Now, what's it
gonna be?

112
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,656
( Whispered )
Do it.

113
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,598
That's 20K

114
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,828
But half before
Frank said.

115
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,461
I remember what
Frank said.

116
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,028
Well, I don't
have it on me

117
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,437
I can go, I can get it

118
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,272
I can be back
within two hours

119
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,246
I'll be here.

120
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,838
Ah so that's H then?

121
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,178
Until you bring me
the first half and I give you

122
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,876
instructions on how to get me
the second half.

123
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,647
Frank will handle that

124
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,552
After tonight, you'll
never see me again

125
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,749
and your
wife will be dead

126
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,190
No misunderstandings, let
me hear you say it.

127
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,364
No misunderstandings

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,403
I want her dead

129
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,999
<i>Nick: No misunderstandings</i>

130
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,472

131

135
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,312
Just hold on to that tape, let's
see where he goes.

136
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,877
Right, he said he'd be
back here in a couple of hours

137
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,217
Perfect.

138
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,222

139
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,281

a drink on me.</i>

141
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,786
Two even.

142
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,794
Talk to you soon.

143
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,435
Hey sorry about that.

144
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,732
Oh, no problem.

145
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,864
I'd like to make
it up to you.

146
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,963
No need.

147
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,133
Here you go.

148
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,777
I see you're the kind
of guy that takes initiative

149
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,779
Is that bad?

150
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,042
No, it'll serve
you well.

151
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,378
Don't they
card people anymore?

152
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm older than I look

153
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,747
- 12?
- Cheers.

154
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,415
- Henry.
- Francine

155
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,752
Can I ask you a
question, Francine?

156
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,087
It depends.

157
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,319
By some miracle of
circumstance,

158
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,452
I happened
to look over there

159
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,893
and you were lifting your
shirt for that guy.

160
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,929
Hmm, that's not
a question.

161
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,591
My question, and call me
a hopeless romantic,

162
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,797
is about the extraordinary
possibility of those being real

163
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,271
Could they be?

164
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,069
You need a girlfriend.

165
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,404
I have a girlfriend.

166
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,570
- Where is she?
- Stood me up.

167
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,614
Aw, a tale of woe, playing
on my sympathy.

168
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,705
Good luck with that

169
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,452
Are you waiting
for someone?

170
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,512
Nope, just gonna sit here
and watch you shoot some pool

171
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,080
Pm not very good

172
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,092
Hmm, what would a pool
shark say?

173
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,364
I could teach you

174
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,899
How do you know
I'm not one?

175
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,593
That's a good point

176
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,533
Maybe you flash guys and
take them for all they're worth

177
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,071
You'll never know

178
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,838
But what I love most of
all is photography.

179
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,404
Some of my teachers say
I have a real knack for it.

180
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,972
I get myself
into dangerous situations

181
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,780
and document them

182
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,343
People seem to trust me

183
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,049
Like gang bangers and bikers
weird-ass freaks

184
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,955
who by all means should be
kicking the crap out of me.

185
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,789
They don't
find me threatening

186
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,227
They tell me stuff

187
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,593
It's a weird talent

188
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,130
What?

189
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,635
You remind me
of my ex-husband

190
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,829
Ouch

191
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,804
No, he had some
good qualities.

192
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,238
Okay, he's a son of
a bitch,

193
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,708
but he once
had a great ass

194
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,439
Wow, I feel
objectified here

195
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,344
Tell me the truth

196
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,713
did you pick the bathroom
lock earlier?

197
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,343
Because I know for a fact
that I locked it.

198
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,582
That sounds all wrong

199
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,319
Truth is I was just
looking for an excuse

200
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,883
to talk to you

201
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,428
You weren't trying to get
into the bathroom with me?

202
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,828
No, that's not very
gentleman-like.

203
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,559
Not to mention unhygienic

204
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,259
On that note, I'll
be right back.

205
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,458
Which way did
he go?

206
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,189
I don't know

207
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,958
She just walked
out on her bill.

208
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,231
- Is he a regular?
- No.

209
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,598
Hey, your friend said
you'd settle it.

210
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,636
He is not my friend

211
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,865
Well you looked pretty
friendly to me.

212
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,997
Yeah, well, he stole my
wallet with my keys, everything

213
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,234
Jesus, do you want
me to call the cops?

214
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,331
No, no cops.

215
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,341
You have never
seen him before?

216
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,376
No.

217
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,605
I have.

218
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,943
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple weeks ago,

219
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,473
I saw him hitting on this
little hottie at the Tonga Hut

220
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,110
Okay do you
know her name?

221
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,849
No, but she has a tattoo
on her shoulder.

222
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,549
It says “Lucky you. “

223
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,786
Listen, here is
my number,

224
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,260
you hear
anything, you call me.

225
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,024
And the tab?

226
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,224
I just told you he
stole my wallet.

227
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,630
Yeah so you say

228
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,894
- What, you think this is some
elaborate routine

229
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,957
to not
pay you, I'm a cop

230
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,526
- You're a cop?
- Ex-cop.

231
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,627
And he
stole your wallet

232
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,468
Save it, I'll find him,
I'll be back in an hour

233
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,138
<i>♪♪</i>

234
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,784
<i>♪♪</i>

235
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,495
Teri: The roaming eye
alights a solitary, young woman

236
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,235
walking through a den
of ill repute.

237
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,767
You know this place or
surely know one like it.

238
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,575
These so-called palaces
of sin

239
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,345
where young women in flimsy
underwear gyrate robotically

240
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,011
while male
patrons with an otherwise

241
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,921
catastrophically moldy grasp of
male-female communication skills

242
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,391
try out
their studliest one-liners

243
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,018
amidst a barrage
of staring

244
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,587
and drooling
and wagging of tongues

245
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,566
The clientele at these places is
fairly interchangeable.

246
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,695
You've met one peeler bar
customer, you've met them all

247
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,763
These guys seem to only listen
to Motley Crue or maybe Zeppelin

248
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,070
and love to play golf.

249
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,577
They usually vote for
the most conservative politician

250
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,706
as long as he looks and sounds
like a jock.

251
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,446
Now that we've
established our setting

252
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,851
let me take this opportunity
to introduce the young woman

253
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,514
with what the consensus
of the day,

254
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,559
would surely deem
an extraordinary behind

255
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,821
and a practiced strut

256
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,659
That would be me
stage name... Trix

257
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,462
Catholic name...
Teresa Augustina

258
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,729
preferred name Terr

259
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,762
One look at me, all supple youth
and feline affectation,

260
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,436
you'd correctly assess I
neither stand out nor blend in

261
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,274
Appearing by all
conventional notions

262
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,941
to simply be one more apathetic
skin-trade participant.

263
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,211
The type of girl
with little or no connection

264
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,220
to the bra burning activists
of yesteryear.

265
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,552
Lucky you,
says dare number one.

266
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,559
Dare number two occupies
a more private place.

267
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,959
Although here
the term private is relative

268
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,861
like all my lucid revelations
are relative,

269
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,366
like my loathing for
gentlemen such as this one

270
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,232
is relative.

271
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,271
What do you say I take you
far away from all these creeps

272
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,173
and I show you a dozen
tricks I can do with my tongue?

273
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,404
Loathsome because, well

274
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,447
it's just hideous how he assumes
everybody else is a creep

275
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,347
but not him and his
horrifying invitation

276
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,683
And relative because I'm pretty
sure he's my second cousin.

277
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,848
However, none of
this occupies my thoughts

278
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,358
as I apply my war paint
and tuck and cover

279
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,860
all my fetishized bits

280
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,658
those parts
deemed the most exciting

281
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,289
in the fashion of
the moment.

282
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,857
No, what occupies my thoughts
is the reminder

283
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,834
that I'm not
a woman of action

284
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,462
I'm a woman of will

285
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,371
but I can't believe in my will
unless I act from it.

286
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,070
Onstage is where I truly
come alive, where I shine

287
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,845
where I kick serious ass

288
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,113
You're coming for
drinks after, right?

289
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,621
I can't tonight, sorry

290
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,849
This is the highlight
of my day.

291
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,448
The rest is paste

292
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,288
When their eyes
and crotches are hot-wired

293
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,794
to my every tiniest
single move,

294
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,262
that's when I stop time

295
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,563
and I become myself
the real me.

296
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,968
Theresa the Astonishing!

297
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,836
But you already
knew that.

298
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,705
Cunning feats of mentalism
and supernatural amusements

299
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,507
performed with
the drop of a hat.

300
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,275
Theresa the Astonishing
can tell

301
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,940
with the blink
of an eye

302
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,780
that Ricky here is obsessed
with his neighbor Collette

303
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,617
and that her complete dismissal
of his pathetic advances

304
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,183
has caused him to purchase
some gamma hydroxyl butyrate

305
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,091
to slip into her drink
later tonight.

306
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,856
That Jimmy is secretly
deeply in love

307
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,867
with his best friend Roger

308
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,062
even though he's
assisted his sociopathic friend

309
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,299
more than once in bashing what
Roger here so sweetly calls,

310
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,241
“Dumb-ass homo pussies “

311
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,315
That Emir Horsain beats
his mistress.

312
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,716
That Regis Blackburn Senior
raped his wife repeatedly.

313
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,778
That Marko Castillano is
deep-down a sensitive man

314
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,290
who could potentially learn
to respect women,

315
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,520
but then he does that and
you realize

316
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,425
he's got a way to go.

317
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,964
Maybe he doesn't need all
this trust fund cash.

318
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,364
That in his longing for
female companionship

319
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,892
Nestor "Needle Dick"
Molina, has been harassing

320
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,405
a mute, young clerk at the
public library,

321
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:01,172
humiliating her
with his dirty insinuations.

322
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,213
- Are you sorry?
- Sorry?

323
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,271
I'm doing her a favor

324
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,338
What's the problem?

325
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,611
No problem, Needle Dick

326
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,651
Let me see it.

327
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,018
See what--
Hey, what are you--

328
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,819
Sometimes Teresa feels
mischievous.

329
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,757
Sometimes she
can go too far.

330
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,989
But that's why she's called
astonishing, people.

331
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,569
Hmm, three inches

332
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,467
I suppose he could
be a grower.

333
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,798
Sensitive question, Nelson

334
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,672
are you a grower
or a show-er?

335
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,541
Don't lie
now, this is vital

336
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,171
Pm a grower

337
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,340
You lyin'.

338
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,145
Too bad

339
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,412
The whole game is
rigged against us.

340
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,455
Somebody's gotta tip the
scales once in a while.

341
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,390
Pow, pow, pow

342
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,087
Die, little douche bags

343
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,223
The women of the world
sleep a little cozier tonight

344
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,563
( applauding )

345
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,505
They are such world-class
jerks tonight.

346
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,009
I don't know how
you do it.

347
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,012
Gotta lighten up, babe

348
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,706
I hate this job

349
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,942
( phone ring tone)

350
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,007
Hey baby cakes

351
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,884
No, perfect timing
I just finished.

352
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,354
<i>Okay celosita.</i>

353
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,446
Bye

354
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,660
A wife wants to take her
husband to a strip club

355
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,829
for his birthday,
all right?

356
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,202
So they go to the
strip club,

357
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,797
doorman sees the guy

358
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,776
he says “Hey Dave
how you been?“

359
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,506
Walking in,
the wife says

360
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,377
How did he know
your name?

361
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,074
You been to
this strip club before?

362
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,744
He says, "No, no, no, that guy's
on the bowling team.

363
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,481
We bowl every
Thursday night together," right

364
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,456
Sit down at the table, waitress
comes over and says,

365
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,459
"Hey, Dave,
you want the usual?"

366
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,223
She brings him over
a Budweiser.

367
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,422
She says, "Wait a minute

368
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,488
how did that woman know
you drink Budweiser?"

369
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,125
He says, "Well, she's on
the ladies bowling team,

370
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,726
they all know what
I drink.

371
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,362
Come on, relax

372
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,566
Next thing you know, a stripper
comes over,

373
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,438
jumps right
on his lap and says

374
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,105
"Hi, Davey, you want
the usual lap dance?"

375
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,944
That's it, the wife picks
up her bag, leaves the place

376
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,950
Dave runs after her
he goes outside.

377
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,849
She's just
jumping into a cab

378
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,286
He opens the door, he jumps
in behind her, he says,

379
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,982
Look,honey,honey
I'm telling you,

380
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,289
that-- that woman must have
thought I was somebody else.

381
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,726
She's not having it
the wife,

382
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,525
she's screaming
at the top of her lungs

383
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,997
calling him every name
in the book.

384
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,160
The cab driver turns
around at that moment and says

385
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,171
"Looks like you picked
up a real bitch tonight, Dave

386
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,207
( men laughing )

387
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,583
Bill-- Billy, Billy
can't you see

388
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,811
we're playing
cards, you know?

389
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,216
This guy's giving
me a headache.

390
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,778
He said it's urgent

391
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,448
Aw, Billy

392
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,356
All right, be
right back.

393
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,826
Don't look at my cards

394
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,996
Hey.

395
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,733
Mr. Aldo, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to interrupt you

396
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,172
I know you?

397
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,573
Yo, it's Nick.

398
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,076
Nick.

399
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,374
Nicholas, your dentist

400
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,812
My dentist?

401
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,009
Nick, you almost gave
me a heart attack.

402
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,312
I'm in
the middle of a game.

403
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,250
My mind is elsewhere

404
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,982
What are you doing here?

405
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:37,426
Um, actually it's
about the funds.

406
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,520
The funds?

407
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,327
Yeah, you know, the money I gave
you to hold for me to invest.

408
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,197
The-- remember the 20 grand?

409
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,759
Yeah, I remember

410
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,101
- You need it?
- I do.

411
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,105
Right now?

412
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,937
Yeah, sorry for
the late notice.

413
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,408
I tried to get in touch
with you, I left you

414
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,776
- a couple of messages, but--
- You called my house?

415
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,973
Yeah.

416
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,845
You speak to my wife?

417
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,976
Yes.

418
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,986
How did she sound?

419
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,318
Did she sound
out of breath?

420
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,755
( Panting )

421
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,121
What?

422
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,717
I'm just kidding you.

423
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,559
I trust my wife implicitly
on all matters.

424
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,157
Give me ten minutes, I'm
finishing this hand,

425
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,701
I'll get you your money.

426
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,792
See I'm in a
little bit of a hur--

427
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,701
No, no, no,
just have a drink

428
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,899
Tommy, give my dentist
a drink.

429
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,205
There's a singer coming
up, really good voice, relax

430
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,451
man: Tress.

431
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,583
Excuse me?

432
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,458
Tress, mess.

433
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,488
Uh, I got no idea what
you're talking about.

434
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,330
Down with the manners
up with the dress.

435
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,735
Johnny sweet-talked
Alice into this mess.

436
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,433
Is that some
kind of a rhyme?

437
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,339
Into duress

438
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,742
You some kind of poet?

439
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,541
Now, now she's depressed

440
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,172
<i>- Now who's depressed?
- That could work.</i>

441
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,409
Down with the manners
up with the dress.

442
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,816
Johnny sweet-talked Alice
now who's depressed?

443
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,548
It's ambiguous

444
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,884
Could be Johnny's the
one who's depressed.

445
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:17,018
I get it, you're
the singer here

446
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,152
Teddy Wright.

447
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,356
Nick.

448
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,023
Nick.

449
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,931
Are you in some
sort of trouble?

450
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,298
Why do you say that?

451
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,100
You just got a puzzling
way about you.

452
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,868
You know, you should mind
your own business.

453
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,465
Well, I didn't mean
to antagonize you.

454
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,374
I was just under the impression
that a bar is like a church,

455
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,470
a place where a guy can go
to be left alone

456
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,809
and think in peace

457
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,904
One would think so

458
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,450
Yeah, one would be
wrong, wouldn't one?

459
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,416
Don't get all
riled up now

460
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,851
I'm just saying

461
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,685
man: One more time
Teddy Wright.

462
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,986
Farewell, my sinking ship

463
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,162

Dentist, I got the good
news and I got the bad news

486
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,333
The good news, I have your
money, don't worry,

487
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,201
but I can't give it
to you tonight.

488
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,570
I don't see how that's
good news for me.

489
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,700
No that's the bad news

490
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,336
Um, okay,
I just really-

491
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,244
I need that money tonight

492
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:55,445
I-- I know,
but I don't have it here.

493
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,111
- Where is it?
-It's not here.

494
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,246
I can't get
it until tomorrow

495
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,984
But I-- I just-

496
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,582
I need it, I really need
it tonight.

497
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,990
I understand

498
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,928
That's why when Billy
told me his idea,

499
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,056
I said, "Ah-ha!

500
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,591
We kill two birds, one
stone, everybody's happy."

501
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,000
What idea?

502
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,266
Billy has to go pick something
up for me tonight,

503
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,171
but he
can't go alone

504
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,609
So he said, why don't
you go with him?

505
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,203
This way
you can get your money

506
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,771
What does he
have to pick up?

507
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,283
- Money.
- Money... for you.

508
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,514
Yeah, money for me.

509
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,886
Look, Mr. Aldo, I mean,
all due respect here,

510
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:40,294
I don't want to get
involved in your business

511
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,093
What business is that?

512
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,326
It's none
of my business

513
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,265
Don't get cute with me
what business is that?

514
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,495
I don't
know, I'm a dentist.

515
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,334
Oh, oh, so that--
okay, you're a dentist

516
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,102
That means you're not
accountable for what you say?

517
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,302
What business?

518
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:58,314
Look, all I'm saying is,
you know, you know some guys

519
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,872
I know some guys?

520
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,111
Yeah, sure, I know
some guys.

521
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,881
Billy knows some guys

522
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,751
Everybody knows
some guys

523
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,291
Well, for example
I don't.

524
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,417
I don't know any guys
that's all I'm saying.

525
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,517
All you're saying

526
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,030
Yeah

527
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:20,001
But it's how you're
saying, is a little...

528
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,731
I don't know

529
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,206
A more sensitive man might think
you might be insulting him.

530
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,140
No no no no-- no no

531
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,179
That is
the last thing I want to do.

532
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,373
Good, then the quicker you
go with Billy,

533
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,814
the quicker
you get your 20Gs

534
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,252
( exhaling )

537
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,436
What can I get you?

538
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,912
I'm looking for a girl
I here comes here,

539
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,108
she's got a tattoo on her
shoulder that says, Lucky you

540
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,242
Oh, well, lots of
people come here

541
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,980
I can't check out
every tattoo.

542
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,283
Is that her?

543
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,415
No.

544
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,583
How can you be sure?

545
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,183
I'm not,
I don't know

546
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,694
Why pick her and not her?

547
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,286
You didn't look surreptitiously
in her direction

548
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,127
when I
mentioned the tattoo

549
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,427
You want a drink or what?

550
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,126
Look, she's not in any trouble
but a guy she knows is

551
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,692
and I don't have
a lot of time to find him

552
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,260
I just serve
drinks, you know?

553
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,805
Help me out?

554
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,266
Some of the girls from Chick
Planet come here after work.

555
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,642
I think maybe I've
seen Lucky eat with those two

556
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,510
You are a princess

557
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,776
What are they drinking?

558
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,215
Uh, Tonga Lei
and a Zombie.

559
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,445
Let's do
two more of those

560
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,990
I'm looking for a friend of
yours with a tattoo

561
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,119
that says “Lucky you “

562
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,719
She's not in trouble, but
a guy she knows is,

563
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,095
and I need to find him
right away.

564
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,997
What did he do?

565
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,797
He stole my wallet

566
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,269
(laughing)

567
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,999
but that's not What
Pm after

568
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,405
<i>- Sorry that's not funny
- Yeah Sorry</i>

569
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,465
He took evidence from a
case I'm working on.

570
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,809
(laughing)

571
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,212
Friggin' Henry, man

572
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,374
That's him

573
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,712
- Did you do him?
- Excuse me?

574
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,185
- He's really suave.
- He's not a bad kid

575
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,482
Are you gonna
arrest him?

576
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,817
He just loves
himself the ladies

577
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,983
I don't care about him except
to get back what he took.

578
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,549
I don't
know where he is

579
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,889
Well, what
about his girlfriend?

580
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,122
What girlfriend?

581
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,128
The one with the tattoo

582
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,858
- Teri?
- That's his sister.

583
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,898
Can you call her?

584
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,434
She should
be here any minute

585
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,366
but I don't know that she
knows where he is.

586
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,200
Okay, this is a
life-or-death situation

587
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,943
Henry's secret is that he's a
really talented photographer

588
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,505
So he said.

589
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,811
He did?

590
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:51,718
That's unlike him, he's usually
very modest about that stuff.

591
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,347
I think it's because he
really cares about it.

592
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,948
What are you good at?

593
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,516
What do you mean?

594
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,425
You look like you're
really good at something

595
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,658
and I can't figure
out what it is.

596
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,895
Me, I prefer to be amused
than to be amusing,

597
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,565
but this weed is making
me so paranoid.

598
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,108
I'm usually really
articulate.

599
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,642
No problem.

600
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,838
It all goes back to my
fear of being buried alive

601
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,936
You're afraid of that?

602
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,279
I think about it a lot

603
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,783
That's a pretty
bad way to go

604
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,719
Yeah yeah
second Worst

605
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,119
What's worse?

606
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,747
Dying in your sleep

607
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,450
Why... that seems like
the best way.

608
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,494
That's what they
want you to think

609
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,187
- Who?
- Grown-ups.

610
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:37,666
The people running things
and the church, you know?

611
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,032
They don't really want you
to stop and think about it.

612
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,934
How so?

613
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,372
Well, everybody thinks
that dying in your sleep

614
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,242
is the best way to go, but
it scares the hell out of me

615
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,405
I mean, what if you're
having a nightmare

616
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,642
and you're being chased
by someone

617
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,241
or you're about to jump
off a cliff

618
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,786
and then you have a
heart attack and cite?

619
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,652
I mean, everybody
just thinks,

620
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,022
"Oh, they went
peacefully, it's so great

621
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,617
You know, they're lucky
they didn't suffer."

622
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,685
Blah blah blah

623
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,731
It is the worse
way to go.

624
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,391
I just left her
a message and I texted her

625
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,059
so we just gotta wait

626
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,933
Thank you

627
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,031
No friggin' way, look
who just walked in.

628
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,575
Oh, no.

629
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,803
Who is it?

630
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,003
A real creep from
Chick Planet,

631
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,375
he must
have followed us

632
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,812
He's in love with Teri

633
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,143
Don't look over
don't look.

634
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,649
Is he coming over?

635
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,151
He's coming over.

636
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,114
Ladies...

637
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,317
hey, do you know what
winks and screws like a tiger?

638
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,450
No.

639
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,022
I'm Ralph

640
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,757
Detective Francine Driver

641
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,858
Okay, pirate captain Ralph
expert at pillaging booty.

642
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,199
We're off work, man,
give us a break.

643
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,328
It's a free
country, right?

644
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,497
We didn't ask you
to sit down.

645
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,006
Now if I told you that you
had a beautiful body,

646
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,336
would you hold
it against me?

647
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,172
Those are the worst
pick-up lines I've ever heard

648
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,540
You're bothering
my friends.

649
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,635
But not you?

650
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,874
Me, oh no, I'm
enjoying this.

651
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,109
See, I could tell from
across the room

652
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,048
that you
were a woman of taste

653
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,085
I'm Ralph

654
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,085
You already said that

655
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,120
Did I?

656
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,519
Well it is so hard
to concentrate

657
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,682
with the three of you

658
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,249
you're like a club
sandwich from heaven

659
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,420
Maybe this is the time

660
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,897
Maybe I should introduce
a more personal note.

661
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,331
You married, Ralph?

662
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,773
Yeah,you love
your wife?

663
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,606
You got kids?

664
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,612
You carry their pictures
around in your wallet?

665
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,079
You Want to see 'em?

666
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,913
No, what I want is for you to
apologize to my friends...

667
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,111
I'm sorry.

668
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,676
and never see
them again.

669
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,621
I won't

670
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,215
- Not even at the dub?
- Not even at the club.

671
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,090
See, one loser
approaches them

672
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,426
pretty soon all losers assume
they can waltz right on over

673
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,759
and strike up
a conversation

674
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,731
It's a slippery slope, and
they can't afford to lose

675
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,359
that kind
of credibility

676
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,926
So no more
Chick Planet for you

677
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,097
But I'm a VIP there.

678
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,004
Not anymore, stop living
in the past, Ralph.

679
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,235
It's time to go.

680
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,743
Okay.

681
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,677
Get up now

682
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,873
Okay.

683
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,341
All the way to your car, yeah
keep walking.

684
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,020
You just blew my mind

685
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,293
Detective!

686
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,231
I love you

687
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,203
I just remembered where
Teri was going tonight.

688
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,636
Just came to you huh?

689
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,504
Okay, I have a problem
with authority, I admit it

690
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,872
Don't tell her I'm
a detective,

691
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:34,876
just let me talk to her

692
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,241
Okay.

it's your birthday?

709
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,523
Coming out party

710
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,155
You're gay.

Oh you're a tough guy

713
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,929
Let's not put
labels on a man

714
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,238
Life is unfriendly

718
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,542
Nothing

719
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,449
You were on
the phone earlier

720
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,647
What was that
all about?

721
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,884
You eavesdropping on me?

722
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,119
I read lips real good

723
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,287
little talent you
develop inside.

724
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,024
You're bluffing

725
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,360
Are we playing cards?

726
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,266
Bluffing to try to get me to
reveal something about myself

727
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,828
Emmit, it's me again.

728
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,464
I don't
mean to be a pest

729
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,271
Now first of all, a woman like
you could never be a pest.

730
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,539
You don't have the tone
of voice for it.

731
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,481
You know, you gotta have a
certain screechiness, you know?

732
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,075
How did you hear that?

733
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,621
I meant it when I said I don't
need a commitment,

734
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,156

being played

735

738
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,363

739
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,460
You're having a fling
with your neighbor?

740
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,833
Is he married?

741
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,702
Divorced

742
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,002
I gotta get back
to work.

743
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,133
What work?

744
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,177
How long you
been dating this guy?

745
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,645
Weeks months?

746
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,773
It's been seven
eight months.

747
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,544
He's not your
upstairs neighbor?

748
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,778
What if he is?

749
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,820
Bedroom isn't
just above yours?

750
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,116
It is.

751
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,781
That's your trouble
right there.

752
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,054
So, when you're not out
with him, he says he's at home

753
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,857
you hear his
bed springs creaking

754
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,889
He's got some other
broad up there?

755
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,629
So what do I do?

756
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,693
- You have to move...
( laughing )

757
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,434

put up a couple more of those

758

my kids are about
to show up.

How do you know?

760
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,080
I can feel them

761
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,547
Teri: All words
have double meanings

762
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,347
even the small words all bundled
up in death and sex and--

763
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,751
What is this?

764
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,811
Just take
a deep breath

765
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,821
You're an asshole

766
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,152
Teri!

767
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,489
Let her go!

768
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,029
Do yourself a favor and
never have a daughter.

769
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,656
Cuddliest little things
until about the age of 12

770
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,964
then be prepared to be
banished forever.

771
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,936
I once dodged
a bullet from her

772
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,337
True story, not a figure
of speech.

773
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,411

Ah, Tatiana, Annabel?

777
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,991
This is my kid

778
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,866
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm

779
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,675
I've been dreaming

780
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,910
that I can't sleep

781
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:46,683
I wake up exhausted
every morning.

782
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,587
I got this bag for you

783
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,690
Yeah.

784
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,940

even the littlest of ones

786
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,005
That's why you can't
trust words, Henry.

787
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,600
I got this for you, too

788
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,196
It's Spanish, antique

789
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,782
It's for food.

want to a woman,

and maintain her respect

794
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:26,378
You can forget a
romantic anniversary

795
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,687
you can cheat on her
with her best friend.

796
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,489
You can pop her in the
rear once in a while

797
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,021
just to change the
pace of things.

798

I spent all Christmas with
him watching soccer on TV

European League

826
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,992
He had no idea who
was playing.

827
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,396
He'd start rooting
for a team

and then
ask me who it was.

829
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,263
I'd leave the room and
walk back in

830
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:58,501
and he'd greet me with
this huge smile.

831
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,769
Ask me all sorts
of questions.

832

Soon enough he didn't know
who I was, what anything was

00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,249
You know, you've been through
this before, Mr. Trombone.

890
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:05,021
That son of a bitch beats
my horse out by a nose

891
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,993
in a photo finish

892
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,053
Muriel almost
crapped her pants

893
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,066
30 to 1 odds on
Huffy Banana

894
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,763
I mean, how could I put
money on a horse like that?

895
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:19,638
Aw, I'm sorry,
Mr. Trombone

896
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,439
Ah, anyway, you
know Muriel.

897
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,773
I'm getting the treatment

898
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,075
Yeah, she'll come around

899
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,080
She always does

900
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,582
At least the house
is quiet.

901
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,947
I got that to look
forward to,

902
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,283
and I, you know
I got my health.

903
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,617
Have you lost weight?

904
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,715
Yeah, maybe, I mean she hasn't
fed me since that happened.

905
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,488
But, you know, I'll
probably put it back on

906
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,893
Don't Worry

907
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,487
<i>Pm not</i>

908
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,055
Have fun tonight

909
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,862
You too sweetheart

910
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,700
( doorbell buzzing )

911
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,433
You should probably
wear this.

912
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,104
Hey, guys, it's
members-only night

913
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,304
Well, that's a
good thing,

914
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,540
because this is a
members-only hold-up

915
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,081
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ!

916
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,016
Wallets, purses,
jewelry, go, go, go!

917
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,212
Hey, you should probably
put that on

918
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,949
or she's gonna pick you
out in a line-up.

919
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,389
It takes an average
of 15 seconds

920
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,722
to form a personal picture
of someone in a crisis.

921
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,125
Or would you rather
I just shoot her?

922
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,321
Jesus Christ, put
it on!

923
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,762
No, no, no,
don't, don't, don't

924
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,059
I'll put it on, you don't have
to do that-- w-w-why--

925
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,158
Shut up, why don't you
just go watch the door, okay?

926
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,668
Right

927
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,831
Hey, fill up this bag, fill it
up, watches, watches, okay?

928
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:25,839
Here

929
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,375
No, not that one
the gold one.

930
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,569
Okay.

931
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,838
Okay there you go

932
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,311
What the hell would I want
to do with a plastic watch?

933
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,279
I don't know

934
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,647
Hey,hey,
what are you doing?

935
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,912
I told you to go watch
the door.

936
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,385
I don't want
to have to kill this bitch

937
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:39,614
No, no, don't-- don't
don't kill her.

938
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,123
Not that door, go park your ass
in front of the curtain,

939
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,385
make sure nobody
is peeking in.

940
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,119
Ah,phones,too,
the phones?

941
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,131
Oh here

942
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,259
Great, great, you're
doing great.

943
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:57,794
You've got
great eyes, by the way.

944
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,603
Yeah, they just hit
you like, bam!

945
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,406
Spring-loaded glove
to the face, ha-ha-ha!

946
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,276
Pm sure you've heard
that before though

947
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,643
Please don't hurt
me, okay?

948
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,183
I just
work here part-time

949
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,184
Well, what do you
want to be?

950
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,413
I'm studying to be a
dental hygienist.

951
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,012
What are the chances
he's a dentist.

952
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,318
I'm a dentist

953
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,357
Hey, by the way, how are
we looking in there?

954
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,517
L-- I don't know

955
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:18,753
Why don't you
check, Einstein?

956
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,159
Make sure nobody's
peeking in, okay?

957
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,999
( Ping-pong game sounds )

958
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,914
What?

959
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,827
Can you
believe these perverts?

960
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,762
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking?

961
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,163
I doubt it

962
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,826
Aldo always says I don't
see the big picture,

963
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,131
well, now I see it
and it's panoramic

964
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,432
What's panoramic?

965
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,132
You know, like a wide-screen TV
with the black bars

966
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,435
at the
top and the bottom

967
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,033
Yeah, I know what
the word means.

968
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,305
All right, then let's take
some pictures of these yahoos

969
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,812
We already have their
names and addresses.

970
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,815
I will bet they would pay
beaucoup bucks to make sure

971
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,782
those pictures don't get to
their kids' schools,

972
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,149
thew bosses and whatnot

973
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,245
Why don't you
just let them be, okay?

974
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,290
Because blackmail
never works.

975
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,484
What do you
know about it?

976
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,958
Because I tried it
once in high school

977
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,688
You should
listen to her

978
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,730
- Take your clothes off.
- What?

979
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,730
- Get in there.
- What are you doing?

980
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,289
This is a
robbery, people!

981
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,595
( Nick )
What are you doing?

982
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,539
All right, get in there
take 'em off.

983
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,631
She just works here, why
does she have to

984
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:41,869
take off her domes?

985
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,502
Because I want to see
what she looks like.

986
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,171
I am not taking off
my clothes.

987
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,146
Okay, look,
listen, just--

988
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,912
All right, leave her be,
I'll take my clothes off

989
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,977
Why would I want you to
take off your clothes?

990
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,181
True

991
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,723
Well, if you're gonna pick
on somebody,

992
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,122
pick on
that guy over there

993
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,319
Why mm?

994
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,884
He looks mean

995
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,989
No,see,
I like his girlfriend

996
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,397
That is not his
girlfriend.

997
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,026
Hey you come here'

998
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,662
- Me?
- Yes, you

999
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,304
- Let's be gentlemen about-- - -
- Hey, shut up--

1000
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,472
Yes you come here
come on sugar his

1001
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,038
We don't have all day

1002
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,515
Don't call her
sugar tits!

1003
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,456
You think that's loaded?

1004
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,718
What am I, stupid?

1005
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,192
You're just saying that

1006
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,388
That one's for show
this one's loaded.

1007
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,795
So if I squeeze this
trigger, nothing happens?

1008
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,492
Squeeze away, compadre.

1009
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,069
( Clicking )

1010
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,232
Damn it.

1011
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,668
All right, doll face,
let's see what you got

1012
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,114
Leave her alone!

1013
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,583
( Screaming )

1014
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,348
Get out of here run
everybody run'

1015
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,124
Oh, my God
is that you?

1016
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,559
No, no, shh.

1017
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,894
So you know about Otis?

1018
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,523
Is that really you?

1019
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,761
<i>No no Karen no
that's not me</i>

1020
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,031
This isn't me

1021
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,699
It's not what
it looks like.

1022
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,332
I am so ashamed

1023
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,001
No, no, don't
cry, Karen--

1024
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,738
No, no, no, not here

1025
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,007
But when those guys came
into the bar,

1026
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,071
before I
realized it was you.

1027
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,879
A single thought
came into my head

1028
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,180
First I thought terrorists

1029
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,312
but then it just hit me
like a hammer,

1030
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,323
and everything became clear

1031
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,917
I have been so misguided
and so selfish,

1032
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,861
telling myself that I need
something more from life

1033
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,128
something dangerous
something exciting,

1034
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,896
and you are the most
exciting thing

1035
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,370
that's ever happened to me

1036
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,405
Oh!

1037
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,668
(screaming. gun firing)

1038
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,910
<i>♪♪</i>

1039
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,387
Okay, I'm here
you big baby.

1040
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,951
You set me up?

1041
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,356
I didn't know she
was gonna do that

1042
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,361
Now get off him

1043
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,896
- Oh, shit, she's a cop.
- Ex-cop.

1044
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,896
- You ripped off a cop?
- Ex-cop.

1045
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,261
I didn't know

1046
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,925
How stupid
could you be?

1047
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,525
Can I just say you look
really great from this angle?

1048
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,126
See where your hand is
that's a felony.

1049
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,637
I was right, though: real

1050
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:24,900
This better be intact

1051
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,566
I swear, I didn't
touch it.

1052
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,700
The cash I did spend

1053
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:29,903
It was an emergency,
I'm so sorry.

1054
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,674
You spent
her cash on Dodge?

1055
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,839
Hit him again

1056
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:33,973
Hey, stop trying to
help me, honestly.

1057
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,914
( Cell phone vibrating )
Is that me, where is it?

1058
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,544
Yeah, it's right there

1059
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,680
Sam, hold on one sec

1060
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:42,883
Oh, really?

1061
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,186
Sta?'

1062
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,521
He fessed up to

<i>No. he fessed up
to his wife.</i>

00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,859
How do you know?

1066
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,369
He came clean, soup to
nuts, and she forgave him

1067

1068

That's not all.

1069
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,798

went off,

1070
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,604

with the bullet?

1071
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,609

Bingo

1073
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,872
Okay, so we got him
on manslaughter.

1074
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,175
No. an accident.

1075

Oh. come on.

1076

naked witnesses

Wait until you get

There is a nudist
ping-pong club in Silver Lake

1081
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,282
The shooting
was at the Cracker Shack?

1082

You've been there?

1083

No, I've just seen the

1084
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,224
There is no sign,
it's members-only

1085
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,356
What can I tell you
I love ping-pong.

1086

won't give back

00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,771
Actually make it two

1241
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,907
So, you had some more
questions for me?

1242
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,815
Yes, basic stuff

1243
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,616
I just don't want to miss
anything on my report.

1244
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,587
It's so lucky you were
right outside

1245
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,352
when that gun Went off

1246
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,860
Not just luck,
I was there on a case, June.

1247
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,452
I was following one
of the perps.

1248
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:02,519
Do you mind if
I call you June?

1249
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,861
What I don't understand is
why he wanted me

1250
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,594
to take off my clothes

1251
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,431
I mean, you're right
in the middle of a robbery

1252
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:11,938
adrenaline pumping
violence, greed.

1253
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:16,307
Do you really have time to stop
and admire a girl's cha-cha?

1254
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,677
These guys they're
psychopaths

1255
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:20,942
Yeah

1256
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,381
They get off
on fear and entry

1257
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,975
What I don't understand is
the coincidence

1258
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,316
of Nick's ex being there

1259
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,220
Uh, who are you
talking about, Silas?

1260
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,815
Salazar

1261
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,881
Never heard of him

1262
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,791
No, I'm Salazar
Samuel Salazar

1263
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,329
The perp's name is Billy

1264
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,490
Karen is
the other perp's wife, Nick

1265
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,966
Oh yeah Karen

1266
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,331
She's his ex?

1267
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,597
They're still married

1268
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:43,729
Have you seen them
there before?

1269
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,794
Never

1270
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,841
Otis seems to have a lot
of luck bringing women

1271
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,706
there on thew
first date

1272
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,712
It takes a certain kind
of, I don't know,

1273
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,612
je ne sais quoi to bring
a first date

1274
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,049
to a nudist ping-pong bar

1275
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,312
Would you?

1276
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,944
I'm not
much of a player.

1277
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,615
Unless he couldn't
help himself.

1278
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,885
Otis?

1279
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,085
Billy, the perp.

1280
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,991
Maybe he just couldn't
help himself

1281
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,961
and that's why he was
willing to throw away

1282
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,964
all that careful planning

1283
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,263
just to get a peek at me
in my birthday suit.

1284
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,170
It's kind of like a
Greek myth, you know?

1285
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,435
I think you're
romanticizing it a little,

1286
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,000
which is perfectly
natural.

1287
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,672
I don't think that he
planned it all that thoroughly

1288
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,681
I hear the words
coming out of my mouth

1289
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,148
and I want to cry

1290
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,276
but I can't
remember the last time I cried

1291
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,412
I make eye contact and not when
I'm supposed to,

1292
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,080
spewing platitudes
plausible enough

1293
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,714
mmm
WW

1294
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,588
but what I really want
to say to her is--

1295
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,992
Did I mention you set my
heart a-flutter

1296
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,929
and make me
feel all funny inside?

1297
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,466
Heaven forbid I go
through with it.

1298
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,798
I'm the kind of guy who
always bets on the wrong horse

1299
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,861
Me, Samuel Salazar, at your
service.

1300
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,271
They say women forget
the physical pain of childbirth

1301
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,036
right after the
baby is born.

1302
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,634
That's how come they can
start all over again,

1303
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,076
have another child

1304
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,579
I guess I'm not like a
woman at all,

1305
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,377
because I have a crystal
clear memory

1306
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,508
of every heartbreak I've
suffered since the age of nine

1307
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:05,484
I was only
conversational then

1308
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,489
Still, I can't help but
wonder if this could be

1309
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,456
a true happy ending

1310
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:14,017
or one more false hope

1311
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,494
It's like a
traffic accident

1312
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,293
I know I shouldn't look, but
I can't turn away,

1313
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,594
because in my heart of
hearts, wherever that is

1314
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:23,194
I know the answer
does not lie within words

1315
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,863
but within her eyes

1316
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:27,101
The world is made up
of a billion little mysteries

1317
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,870
but it's not words that
explain them.

1318
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,411
Of this, I'm sure

1319
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,672
Do you think I could
have developed

1320
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,940
Stockholm Syndrome
that quickly?

1321
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,913
No.

1322
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,417
I've always wanted
to go to Stockholm

1323
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,885
I've never been anywhere

1324
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,650
Have you traveled
a lot?

1325
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,692
A little, mostly in
the United States

1326
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,488
I want to go to Europe

1327
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:49,428
and Egypt and those
raves in Greece

1328
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:52,625
where the music is really
bad and everyone is on ecstasy

1329
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,535
and they're all so super
tanned that it doesn't matter

1330
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,402
Have you been?

1331
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,872
No.

1332
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,374
My friend went once
and she said

1333
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,206
that nobody spoke the same
language,

1334
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,643
but no one had anything
to say anyways,

1335
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,739
so the DJ played the music so
loud that even your eyes hurt.

1336
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,750
Thank you for saving
my life, Samuel.

1337
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:17,883
I wouldn't
go that far

1338
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,056
Is it true that Mexican
men love cunnilingus?

1339
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,563
Um

1340
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,764
Oh, I'm sorry, that came
off really forward.

1341
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,932
I just suddenly feel like
I have this

1342
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,566
new lease
on things, you know?

1343
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,373
And there's just no time for
pleasantries and being polite

1344
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,935
I mean, there's barely
enough time to go out there

1345
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,379
and get What
you Want

1346
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:41,676
My grandfather was
Mexican,

1347
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,240
I was born here

1348
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,583
Oh, I guess it'd be an
awkward question to ask him

1349
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,386
Yeah he's-- he passed
away anyway

1350
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,052
Took the secret
with him.

1351
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,527
Do you Want to dance?

1352
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,795
Not just yet

1353
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:01,831
I'll be right back

1354
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,398
<i>Mmmm!</i>

1355
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,145
Ready for another one?

1356
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,273
Probably

1357
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,180
So how's it
going, officer?

1358
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,949
Detective

1359
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,785
Not going so
well, actually

1360
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,347
You seem a little uptight

1361
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:25,859
if you don't
mind me saying so

1362
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,293
Actually, I do mind, I'm trying
to figure some stuff out.

1363
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,389
- What stuff?
- Personal stuff

1364
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:35,834
about courage

1365
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,099
and what makes us special

1366
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,572
Oh.

1367
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,768
I thought it was
about the girl.

1368
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,174
Her too

1369
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,438
What's wrong with her?

1370
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,207
She's sending me
mixed signals.

1371
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,647
Hey, Officer Salazar?

1372
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,275
Detective

1373
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,081
I'm not
wearing any underwear.

1374
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:00,720
I wouldn't read between
the lines so much.

1375
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:16,169
You are unique.

1376
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,303
There are, I'm sure
uncommon things

1377
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,314
that you
are particularly good at

1378
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,907
Play to your strong
suits, shine.

1379
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,611
Don't concentrate
on things

1380
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:28,747
that other people have
told you you're no good at

1381
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,587
Relish the talents
you have.

1382
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,560
And always

1383
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:37,689
always surround yourself
with people who appreciate you

1384
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,295
Sam?

1385
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:50,171
<i>♪♪</i>

1386
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,454
<i>♪♪</i>

1387
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:08,087
(whirring)

1388
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:20,933
But if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you

1389
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:23,603
I haven't had a real piece
of ass since El Paso.

1390
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,169
That was one hot, little
lady you had there.

1391
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,942
Jewel

1392
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,745
I suppose you banged her
too, after I left.

1393
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,252
Well, I was with my wife
at the time, remember?

1394
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,788
She gets manicures, doesn't she,
she goes shopping?

1395
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,517
All wives do

1396
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,081
Just saying, where there's
a will there's a way.

1397
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,558
Point is I didn't
do anything.

1398
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:42,289
Yeah, you wanted
to, I can tell.

1399
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,921
Empty again

1400
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,964
You ready for another?

1401
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,432
No, still working
on this.

1402
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:49,835
Mikey did, though

1403
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,997
Chafes me to this day
you know why?

1404
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,870
Because if I hadn't
told him she was hooking

1405
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,740
he never would have had the
balls to ask her up to his room

1406
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,439
Guy is a complete pussy when it
comes to talking to women,

1407
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,176
especially women with
cans like those.

1408
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,478
I don't know what
you're talking about

1409
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,382
You never noticed how
intimidated he gets around women

1410
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,613
who got a great rack?

1411
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,246
Never noticed

1412
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:12,589
He-he-he can't talk, he
st-st-st-stutters.

1413
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,956
It must be something
in his past.

1414
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,723
Mother, I don't know

1415
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,333
You remember how he could
never talk to your ex?

1416
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,766
No disrespect

1417
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,065
None taken

1418
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:28,006
Guy can't see past a
decent-sized double barrel

1419
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,475
Great looking girl, though

1420
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,534
We're talking about
Francine now?

1421
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,377
No, I mean, her, too, but,
no, Jewel.

1422
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,212
What was her real name?

1423
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,013
Nice Jewish name

1424
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,054
Oh, man, let me tell you, that
is a lethal combination.

1425
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,589
Nice Jewish girl drops
out of school, starts hooking

1426
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,283
Unstoppable

1427
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,384
Night you saw her,
what was she wearing?

1428
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:50,192
To be honest, I don't
remember what she had on

1429
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,789
More the shape underneath

1430
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,357
didn't leave so much to
the imagination.

1431
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,870
She had me up like a
rock for five days.

1432
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,134
Blue steel, I don't
mind telling you.

1433
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,903
That's a lot of information

1434
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,500
Yeah, I'm
not kidding you, man.

1435
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,977
We've known each other
ten years?

1436
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,945
Six

1437
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,448
- A long time
- Long time.

1438
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,211
- Long time
- Long time.

1439
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,809
At least among the
guys on the force,

1440
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,581
I consider you a fairly
knowledgeable

1441
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,316
connoisseur of ass

1442
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,789
I don't know where you're
going with this.

1443
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:20,851
Look, after the divorce

1444
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,261
you've had your fair
share of tail.

1445
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,663
You know, I'm just going
by the red head with the boots

1446
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,031
and the cousins down
Cucharacha Way?

1447
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,536
Who was that chick you
were with the other night?

1448
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,834
Camilla, she's my neighbor

1449
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,602
What did you do, ring
her doorbell,

1450
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,904
ask her for sugar
or something?

1451
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,103
She's a good gm

1452
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,372
She's got some issues

1453
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,141
I'm just trying to loosen
her up a little.

1454
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,705
Point is, you like it

1455
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,807
What?

1456
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:44,977
Ass!

1457
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,511
You mean the actual
buttocks or the general region?

1458
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:49,715
What?

1459
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,487
The royal ass, women
dames, skirts.

1460
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:53,993
Sure, I like them

1461
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,586
Yeah, well, see, these
guys today,

1462
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,959
young guys on the force

1463
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,896
they don't seem to
think about it all that much

1464
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,957
Maybe it's a
generational shift

1465
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:06,069
Porn on the Internet
I don't know.

1466
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,698
You know, maybe I didn't
think about it as much

1467
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,367
when I was younger

1468
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,605
One day it just
hit me: wham!

1469
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,944
Full-blown epiphany

1470
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,211
Went from being a hobby to
a full-time occupation.

1471
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,479
Chasing skirts

1472
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,215
Yeah, I don't know
when it happened.

1473
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:24,087
I don't know why
it happened.

1474
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,286
At first, it was because
things were terrible

1475
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,296
with me and Eileen

1476
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:32,993
Terrible

1477
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:36,434
and then it
was because she found out

1478
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,995
things between us
got worse.

1479
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:43,305
If you want ass, there is
no ass in the whole wide world

1480
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:48,509
like Jewel Kazinsky
El Paso.

1481
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,812
I'll keep that in mind

1482
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,615
I gotta go

1483
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,848
Ooh!

1484
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,254
- You gonna be all right?
- Sure.

1485
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,293
We should call you
a cab, Captain.

1486
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,522
Speak of the dew

1487
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,261
That your ex-wife?

1488
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,533
Yes, it is

1489
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,165
You still got that photo?

1490
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,141
The photograph you
showed me?

1491
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,404
Yes, sir

1492
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,968
- You got it?
- Excuse me.

1493
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,479
What are you doing here?

1494
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,678
I was thirsty

1495
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:27,778
A thousand bars in this
county, you gotta come here

1496
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,481
Yeah, I like the way
they mix their drinks

1497
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,956
You're something else

1498
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,253
Bar is big enough
for both of us,

1499
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,258
so why don't you go back
to your corner

1500
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,350
and I'll
be right over here.

1501
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,452
You checking up on me?

1502
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,724
What is there
to check up on?

1503
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:37,890
What is it, you like
the aggravation?

1504
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,330
Why are you so
aggravated, Emmit?

1505
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,458
What is it you're
not telling me?

1506
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,002
I'm not telling you
anything, don't have to anymore

1507
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,470
I know you, you're here,
it's because you want something

1508
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,507
Well, rest assured
it isn't you.

1509
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,274
Hi.

1510
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,578
Emmit

1511
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,314
Yeah, I'm not really
a prick, I--

1512
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:04,085
We just have a really bad
history of horrible chemistry

1513
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,090
What's your name?

1514
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,091
Teresa.

1515
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,422
- You?
- Henry

1516
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,053
Hi, could
you do me a favor?

1517
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,597
Could you convince her to
go somewhere else?

1518
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:13,634
We're not so good when
we're around each other

1519
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,795
Okay, if I back you up,
what do I get for my trouble?

1520
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:17,894
What do you want?

1521
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,497
We're hoping to score
some back rubs.

1522
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,304
Funny, keep it
up, Junior.

1523
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,243
Now what?

1524
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,680
Now I got him

1525
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:29,943
You don't have anything

1526
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:33,009
He's on high alert, he
hates your guts and he's a cop

1527
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,487
Watch and learn

1528
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,217
Get us a dark booth

1529
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,587
Hey, man, where do you get off
calling me junior, huh?

1530
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:41,821
<i>Get your hands off me</i>

1531
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,022
How would you like it if I
called you senior

1532
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,029
in front of
your lady friends?

1533
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,156
Let go of my arm

1534
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,825
Why are you so
jumpy man?

1535
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,665
What part of this are you
not understanding, punk?

1536
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,932
You come into this bar
again, I will kick your ass

1537
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,377
How'd it go?

1538
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,887
We're even.

1539
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,617
Not until
you put this back

1540
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,683
I said pick his wallet
not steal it.

1541
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,490
Such a sweet sweet man

1542
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,224
Why would you
ever divorce him?

1543
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,232
H's not here

1544
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,162
This a bad time?

1545
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,399
I was out of line

1546
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:27,463
It's no big deal

1547
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,941
It's a pretty big
deal, let me finish

1548
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,534
As Francine may
or may not have told you

1549
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,943
I've been battling anger
management issues

1550
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,004
for quite
a chunk of time

1551
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,208
Emmit, this is not the time

1552
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,808
I respectfully disagree

1553
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,750
Now I jumped on your
friend here

1554
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,185
and made
an ass out of myself

1555
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,052
and I like to think that we're
all grown up enough

1556
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,386
that I can rectify it

1557
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,448
and we can all enjoy our
evenings at the same location

1558
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,586
without it being awkward

1559
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:49,629
How's everyone doing
over here?

1560
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:50,925
- Another round?
- No.

1561
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:51,930
- No
- No

1562
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:52,931
Sure, my treat.

1563
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,331
Emmit, you really don't
have to do that.

1564
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,926
I'm sorry I
insulted you, man

1565
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,129
Hey. it happens

1566
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,906
Have We met?

1567
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:05,343
Uh, I
don't know, maybe

1568
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,937
- You a dancer?
- Here We go.

1569
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,481
- Yes.
- Exotic.

1570
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,073
Yes

1571
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,050
I think I've gotten
lapped by you.

1572
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,747
Emmit has a photographic
memory of every exotic dancer

1573
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,187
east of the 405

1574
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,249
Now, now, now, let's
not exaggerate.

1575
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,658
Welcome to paradise

1576
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,491
Emmit, Teri's going
through some stuff right now

1577
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,395
and I really, as much as I
appreciate the gesture,

1578
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:29,129
I need some alone time with
her and her brother.

1579
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,434
<i>Her brother?</i>

1580
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,667
No disrespect

1581
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,041
All righty, that'll
be $16 even.

1582
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,807
Okay, let me get this

1583
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,006
Why don't I get this?

1584
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,209
No, no, no, no
I insist.

1585
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,856
Okay.

1586
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,054
You can.... keep it.

1587
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,357
Thank you

1588
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,863
You know, we gotta
get going anyways.

1589
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,366
No no stay

1590
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:01,833
I'll get
out of your hair

1591
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:04,234
You guys drink in peace

1592
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,569
I said
what I came to say

1593
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,345
You look like a million
bucks, Detective Driver

1594
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:24,214
I guess that's that

1595
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,157
That is that

1596
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,229
You guys can go

1597
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,632
Why don't you come
with us?

1598
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,533
Where?

1599
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,266
There's an after hours
starts in a few minutes

1600
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:43,037
Ah, no, I'm done for
the night.

1601
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:44,839
The night hasn't
even started.

1602
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,716
You guys are really going
somewhere else right now?

1603
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,650
We haven't even
danced yet.

1604
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,881
Can't call it a night
out without a little dancing

1605
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,980
What do you
say, Francine?

1606
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,889
Let's get out of here

1607
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:02,087
This place is
crawling with cops

I have something

1613

What?

1614
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,237
- You are a son of a bitch
- I didn't look at it.

1615
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,569
- Right.
- I swear to God.

1616
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,505
You look like an atheist to me.

1617
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,008
Oh, no, I'm a believer.

1618
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,305
I knew what it was right
away, but I figured

1619
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:05,845
if I looked at it,
it would wreck my chances.

1620
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,403
Of What?

1621
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:10,814
I've been trying to get
the nerve to ask you all night.

1622
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:14,480
I want you to pose for
me, for a portrait.

1623
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,920
Why me?

1624
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,356
You have this
intangible quality.

1625
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,619
Try harder.

1626
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,662
I'm cursed by the blossoming
knowledge of my feminine ideal

1627
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,528
and she looks
suspiciously like you.

1628
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,533
That's not bad.

1629
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,660
H's pretty
good you mean.

1630
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:30,965
Not a total waste?

1631
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,562
How about the truth?

1632
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,437
The truth is you're
not my usual type.

1633
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,840
And what's your
usual type?

1634
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:37,934
Gaunt, fashionable and dumb

1635
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,741
with a big, square
Appalachian ass

1636
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,747
and obsessed with
country music.

1637
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:43,305
Jesus.

1638
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,515
Will you at least
consider it?
