2
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,948
You're still alive.

3
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,715
English, Tortuga.

4
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,461
You know where we are?

5
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,141
You're here. Across the border.

6
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,975
From El Fronteras.

7
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,918
El Fronteras.
- Uh-huh.

8
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,111
Is it far?

9
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,046
- Quick walk.
- How long?

10
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,251
Ten, 15 minutes.

11
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,698
You'll like it... Aah! Un.

12
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,133
You'll like it there.

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,265
People are very friendly. Heh, heh.

14
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,908
Why'd you have to start shooting, Tortuga?

15
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,312
I didn't want to be taken alive.

16
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,622
Huh?

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,073
A man is only responsible to himself.

18
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,977
<i>Remember that, perro.</i>

19
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,587
Where will you go?

20
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,255
Acapulco.

21
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,934
Heh. Acapulco?
What are you, on spring break?

22
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,130
That's for tourists.

23
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,074
You want to go someplace nice.

24
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,309
Go to...

25
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,250
...Akumal.

26
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,093
Take care of that bag, amigo.

27
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,192
It carries the blood of many men.

28
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,807
Adiós, Tortuga.

29
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,384
Adiós.

30
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,379
Come on.

31
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,465
Hey.

32
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,935
Leave the dog alone.

33
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,579
Gringo.

34
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,825
Shit.

35
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,699
Hey, girl. How you doing?

36
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,802
You're a good girl, huh?

37
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,112
Go on. Get out of here.

38
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,949
I said, go on.

39
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,286
Whatever.

40
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,652
Give me your bag.

41
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,533
Excuse me?

42
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,993
The bag.

43
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,984
I'm not giving you the bag, kid.

44
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,599
You're holding the knife wrong, honey.

45
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,404
You're supposed to hold the knife
blade down.

46
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,308
Someone comes at you blade up...

47
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,883
...that means they don't know how
to handle a knife.

48
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,552
And give me your shirt.

49
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,614
<i>- What?
- Your camisa. Give it to me.</i>

50
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,364
That's it. Come on.

51
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,592
Thattagirl.

52
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,879
Have a nice day.

53
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,576
Bottle of water, please.

54
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,976
- No water, sorry.
- No water?

55
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,010
Excuse me, miss... Miss?

56
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,214
Excuse me, sir?

57
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,018
- No, I don't want your money. Please go.
- Please, ma'am, I'm very thirsty.

58
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,856
Excuse me.

59
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,594
Some water, please?

60
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,440
We are closed.

61
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,378
Come on, just one glass.

62
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,352
Wow.

63
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,877
Mm. Do you have any money?

64
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,243
What, you don't take American money?

65
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,447
I don't take fake money, hmm?

66
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,880
- Fake?
- Mm.

67
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,782
Come back here
when you have some real money.

68
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,733
Two hundred dollars
for a glass of water. Ahem.

69
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,063
Nope.

70
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,968
Five hundred dollars for a glass of water.
That is my final offer.

71
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
Mm.

72
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,656
You can't drink that.

73
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,426
You're a gringo.

74
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,831
You ever hear of Montezuma's revenge?

75
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,600
Mm.

76
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,862
- You just killed your first man.
- Heh.

77
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,737
Welcome to La M.

78
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,408
Shh, shh.

79
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,173
What's up, Flaca?

80
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,256
<i>I jacked that vato that came into town.</i>

81
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,264
What did you get?

82
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,267
He broke your nose?

83
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,175
What happened to your shirt?

84
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,777
He took it.

85
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,458
He stole the shirt off your back.

86
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,358
<i>Shut the fuck up, putos.</i>

87
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,704
Do you want to get jumped in?

88
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,035
Hmm?

89
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,909
You're going to have to do
better than that, flaquita.

90
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,675
Hmm.

91
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,564
Stray dogs.
They're the scourge of this town.

92
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,360
Spreading disease and vermin.

93
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:48,031
Ahh. If I do only one thing as chief,
it'll be to rid El Fronteras of these...

94
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,241
...miserable, useless creatures.

95
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,242
<i>And you pendejos are no better.</i>

96
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,350
Shit.

97
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,453
You heard the boss.

98
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,015
Adiós, Fronteras.

99
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,915
I'd like to take the next bus to Acapulco.

100
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,517
Acapulco.

101
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,152
<i>Sí, Acapulco.</i>

102
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,414
Why you want to go there? Spring break?

103
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,418
Look, can I just get a ticket
for the next bus, please?

104
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,156
No.

105
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,826
Why not?

106
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,693
No bus to Acapulco.

107
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,100
- No bus to Acapulco?
- Mm-hm.

108
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,261
Okay, so...

109
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,698
How do I get there? You tell me.

110
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,570
No bus.

111
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,545
Try tomorrow.

112
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,349
Try tomorrow? Is there gonna be
a bus here tomorrow or not?

113
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,875
Try tomorrow.

114
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,543
Fuck!

115
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,322
Okay, ma'am, I'm sorry. I apologize.

116
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,366
But do you know where
I can get a glass of water?

117
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,935
- Bus leaves at 2.
- No, there is no bus today.

118
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,947
Of course there is.

119
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,178
They only told you that so you could
stay in town longer and spend your money.

120
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,854
- I gotta go.
- It's too late now.

121
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,927
The bus leaves at 2:00 sharp.
You've missed it.

122
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,434
Spend my money? On what?

123
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,933
I can't even buy a glass of water.

124
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,671
Where are you headed?

125
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,342
<i>Acapulco.
Heh.</i>

126
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,607
- Acapulco? That tourist trap?
- Yeah.

127
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:49,743
Look, if you wanna go somewhere nice,
go to Tulum or Akumal.

128
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,580
Acapulco.

129
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,926
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a room upstairs I could spend the night?

130
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,292
This seems to be the only place in town
that'll take my money.

131
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,930
You can stay in the attic.

132
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,796
For one night.

133
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,171
Fronteras is not for tourists.

134
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:16,041
You should leave here,
even if it is for Acapulco.

135
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,714
You got a name?

136
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,649
Come on, you can tell me your name.

137
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,452
Anna.

138
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,750
- Anna.
- Mm-hm.

139
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,625
Well, Anna, you know
what I really want right now?

140
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,399
What?

141
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,463
A margarita.

142
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,400
- A margarita?
- Yeah.

143
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,272
We only have straight tequila.

144
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,804
Just tequila.

145
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,972
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

146
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,117
Welcome to El Fronteras.

147
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,282
Mm.

148
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,203
No, this ain't right.

149
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,699
I don't like this.

150
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,305
I'm getting the shotgun.

151
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,730
Connors?

152
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,332
Sullivan?

153
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,264
Bill?

154
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,962
Everybody's here.
Where's the other one?

155
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,894
I don't know. I don't see him.

156
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,193
<i>Check the trunk, pendejo.</i>

157
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,363
Get out.

158
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,436
- What are you doing?
- You're a drug dealer.

159
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,637
- No, I'm not.
- You're a bank robber.

160
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,279
No, I'm not.

161
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,778
Get out of my bar.

162
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,541
Why don't you just calm down?

163
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,880
- Get out.
- Just let me explain. I can explain.

164
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,023
- Where did you get all this money?
- You went through my stuff?

165
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,420
I have a right to know
who is living in my house.

166
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,584
You don't have a right
to go through people's stuff.

167
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,991
Where did you get this money, huh?

168
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,799
Hey, no, no, wait!

169
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,025
Get out.

170
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,042
Hey! Wait!

171
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,842
Hey!

172
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,695
Flaca.

173
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,236
Oh, fuck.
- Move!

174
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,311
Give me the bag.

175
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,737
Flaca...

176
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,147
<i>...is this the gabacho
who bloodied your nose?</i>

177
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,573
Yes.

178
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,876
Are you sure?

179
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,932
He's too fast for you.

180
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:41,168
Maybe you should try
to make love, not war.

181
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,782
Quiet!

182
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,351
Who are you?

183
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,195
Nobody.

184
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,858
Just passing through.

185
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,865
What are you doing here?

186
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,803
On my way to Acapulco.

187
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,575
Acapulco?

188
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,309
What, for spring break?

189
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,713
Look, amigo...

190
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,185
...I don't care where you go.

191
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,555
Just get out of El Fronteras.

192
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,630
- Bus doesn't leave till tomorrow.
- Ah.

193
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,777
Make sure you're on it.

194
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,805
Hmm?

195
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,449
Oh, you were a big help.

196
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,168
Get the Predator B airborne.

197
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,672
What do you need a drone for?

198
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,970
They sent four men on that raid.
There's only three in the car.

199
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,814
These tracks mean
there's a car with a flat tire...

200
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,509
...somewhere between here
and the Mexican border.

201
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,881
And I wanna find it.

202
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,325
Suspects heading south on 286.

203
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,256
<i>Copy. Stop and search them.</i>

204
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,261
- Copy that.
- Shit.

205
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,733
Lieutenant,
they're on their way back from the buy.

206
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,098
The only evidence they can have is money.
We can't hold them on that.

207
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,034
<i>Wanna get Section 33'd again?</i>

208
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,540
<i>You search those bums
and report in when you are done.</i>

209
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,909
This is bullshit.
- Copy that.

210
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,607
- Come on, it's called doing yourjob.
- No, it's called wasting your time.

211
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:44,244
How many scumbags are we supposed to
put in jail? They'll just keep coming back.

212
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,525
You come back to finish the job?

213
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,129
Hmm.

214
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,039
Must be late.

215
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,683
I couldn't sleep.

216
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,551
Oh, you were worried about me?

217
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,780
I was worried about the dog.

218
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,082
How do you like our little town?

219
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,923
It's an acquired taste.

220
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:39,567
El Fronteras was once a very nice place.

221
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,643
The Americans used to come here
for the festivals.

222
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:48,050
That's when my father built the bar.

223
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,756
Then the violence came.

224
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,555
The Americans left, the jobs left.

225
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,632
The drug can'tels
needed this town empty, so...

226
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:09,931
They chased everyone away.

227
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,540
The others who stay here
are not allowed to talk to outsiders.

228
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:18,580
They are paid to keep quiet.

229
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,616
Well, that explains why
I can't get a glass of water in this town.

230
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,187
So why'd you stay in El Fronteras?

231
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,223
My grandmother taught me...

232
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:41,832
...a person who stands up
never stands alone.

233
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,474
You believe that?

234
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,808
Don't you?

235
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,846
Not anymore.

236
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,719
One man can't make a difference, honey.

237
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,186
Trust me.

238
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,427
I'm sorry you feel that way.

239
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,900
This town is not safe for you.

240
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,775
Make sure you get on the bus tomorrow.

241
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,540
Anna.

242
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,013
Can't I just come back inside?

243
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,195
Where did you get that money?

244
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,933
Guess it's just you and me.

245
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,901
Hola, Tortuga.

246
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,668
Shit.

247
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,118
Get your head in the game.

248
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,035
Shit!

249
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,531
Thanks a lot, kid.

250
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,999
<i>Two-twenty-two, do you copy?</i>

251
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,864
Lieutenant West.

252
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,268
<i>Lieutenant,
the drone spotted your Cadillac...</i>

253
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,035
<i>...at Mile Marker 63 on the border fence.</i>

254
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,408
Copy that.

255
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,230
Scourge of this town.

256
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,338
Chief.

257
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,848
I'll get the next one.

258
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,684
One by one, I'm gonna clean up this town
till there's no more interference.

259
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,928
Then I will feel
like I have done something.

260
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,566
Chief, the gringo.

261
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,969
He carries a black satchel full of money.

262
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,133
- In dollars?
- Yes.

263
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,268
The coyotes didn't come in yesterday.

264
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:20,247
<i>Instead we get the pinche guerro.</i>

265
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,381
- New plan.
Yes?

266
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:35,630
Make sure he does not get the 2:00 bus.

267
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,398
Cover the bus station.

268
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,601
You tell the others,
and spread out from there.

269
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,553
Shit.

270
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,252
Let me cross the border.
That's all I wanna do.

271
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,826
You ain't got no jurisdiction.

272
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,429
Don't give me this
"no jurisdiction" bullshit.

273
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,591
These motherfuckers killed
three of my men. Three.

274
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,871
<i>Border patrol, DEA
mobile enforcement are already on this.</i>

275
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,312
They'll find the bastards who killed them.

276
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:26,108
So, what are we supposed to do
in the meantime? Sit on our ass? Is that it?

277
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,055
<i>We are going to observe jurisdiction.</i>

278
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,623
And you are going to follow orders.

279
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,410
That's too easy.

280
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,079
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

281
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,491
Do we?

282
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,574
Yes, sir.

283
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,817
How much vacation time do I have?

284
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,983
<i>The bus leaves at 2:00 sharp.</i>

285
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,035
<i>Agua, please?</i>

286
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,967
Miss, come on, I'm dying of thirst here.

287
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,633
Two hundred bucks.

288
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,138
Two hundred bucks. Just take it.

289
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,281
Thank you.

290
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,148
Give me the bag.

291
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,181
Take it easy, kid.

292
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,320
Give me the bag.

293
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:53,190
You know you're supposed
to cock it first, right?

294
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,496
What's your name, kid?

295
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,836
Naco.
Okay, Naco.

296
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,810
We can both just walk away quietly...

297
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,006
...pretend like none of this
ever happened.

298
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,541
We got a deal, amigo?

299
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:27,828
Sneaky little bastard.

300
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,316
Armor-piercing bullets.

301
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,577
Shit.

302
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,259
It's 2:00.

303
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,455
Fuck!

304
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,595
Wait! Stop the bus! Stop the bus!

305
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,144
Shit!

306
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,585
What time is the next bus?

307
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,450
No English.

308
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,292
I said, what time is the next bus?

309
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,126
Tomorrow, 2:00.

310
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,163
Thank you.

311
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,727
Find the American.

312
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,196
Finish this.

313
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,848
No, Flaca!

314
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,860
Fuck.

315
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:22,862
Flaca.

316
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,408
Just listen to me.

317
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,308
Just give me the bag.

318
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,510
Hey, wait.

319
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,545
They're gonna kill you for that money.

320
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,482
Better they find it with me
than with you, right?

321
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,648
<i>Fuck you, puta.</i>

322
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:48,222
<i>We don't have time for pendejadas.</i>

323
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,982
You said one man
can't make a difference.

324
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,185
How about a woman?

325
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,455
I am a police officer.

326
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,555
A policeman.

327
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,563
Border crossing is in Nogales.

328
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:35,101
I'm with La Paz.
New Mexico Police Department.

329
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,272
Now, if you don't open this gate...

330
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:41,740
...I'm gonna report you to the DEA
and Homeland Security.

331
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,177
Nogales is east of here.

332
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,947
<i>You've got a long drive, migra.</i>

333
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,678
Better get started.

334
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,619
Let's think this through.

335
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,260
If Homeland Security
shuts down this fence...

336
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,023
...your bosses are gonna have to find
another place to conduct their affairs.

337
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,326
Now, that is a lot of lost business
on your head.

338
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,636
So why don't you just let me through?

339
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,941
All right, it's your funeral.

340
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:32,821
Oh. Which way to El Fronteras?

341
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,395
Don't.

342
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,670
Why you helping me?
You still think I'm a bad guy?

343
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,470
How many men did you kill today? Hmm?

344
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,072
I didn't really wanna kill any of them.

345
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,410
Oh. Do you get shot every day?

346
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:58,110
You have to tourniquet the wounds
to stop the bleeding.

347
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,448
You need to tie it off with something.

348
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,749
Hurry.

349
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,235
Oh, yeah. Mm.

350
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,043
It was almost won'th getting shot.

351
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,880
Okay. Okay.

352
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:48,530
Heh. Kind of wish he'd shot me
a few more times.

353
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,874
So, uh, what are you gonna use
to bandage me with?

354
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,580
Probably your tongue.

355
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,085
<i>I told you to stay away
from that guerro pinche, Flaca.</i>

356
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,955
While you, you tried to kill me.

357
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,130
That money belongs to us.

358
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,297
<i>- Huh? You have to choose your side, mija.
I know.</i>

359
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:29,639
And I thought if I stole that bag,
you would jump me into the gang.

360
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:38,582
The only way to join La M
is to kill a man.

361
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,623
You got that? Huh?

362
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,792
Now...

363
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,647
You lost this.

364
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,821
I wish I could do something
to help you, Anna.

365
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,651
Still, I'm concerned about your safety.

366
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,001
Did you hear about the man
who shot up a womars bar?

367
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:59,345
That's where I would stay.

368
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:03,079
A bunch of guys came
to a womars bar...

369
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,413
...and they just started
shooting up the place.

370
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:07,549
And why did they shoot up her place?

371
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,352
Because the town was getting
out of control.

372
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,726
And they needed to clean things up.

373
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:26,370
I hear they gave her until midnight
to leave town.

374
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,072
And when she didn't leave...

375
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:33,941
...they kill her.

376
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,394
Oh, shit.

377
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,805
Three cops dead.

378
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,600
Three good cops.

379
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,307
And you take the money...

380
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:06,111
...drug money, and you run?

381
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,086
You are a disgrace.

382
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,350
Yeah, you're right. I fucked up.

383
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:21,529
But you tell me, lieutenant,
what's the point?

384
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,795
You send us out on some bullshit job
to pick up some mutts...

385
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:28,334
...who'll only bounce out on bail
or extradition. That's all we ever do.

386
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,631
We never build a case.
We never solve anything.

387
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,969
And the good cops die
and the bad guys get away. It's bullshit.

388
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:37,135
You gotta think of the big picture.
Take responsibility.

389
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:42,310
You are just one man.
One man cannot change the world.

390
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,846
So, what, are you bringing me in?

391
01:08:56,198 --> 01:09:00,464
I am Lieutenant West
of the New Mexico Police Department.

392
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,236
This man is now under my supervision.

393
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,633
What do you want with the gringo?

394
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,075
He's a wanted man in the United States.

395
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:15,574
I'll be escorting him out of this town.
He is no longer your concern.

396
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,888
What about the money?

397
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:24,551
This money? Are you...?
You making a claim on this money?

398
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,251
Yeah.

399
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,057
This money is now state's evidence.

400
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,564
Maybe that money belongs to us. Huh?

401
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,372
Let me explain something to you,
Skeletor.

402
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,406
You make a claim on this money...

403
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,908
...I'm gonna have the DEA in here
to investigate.

404
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:47,674
Something happens to me,
the DEA will be here to investigate.

405
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,375
Either way, the DEA is gonna be here...

406
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,080
...in your small little town, to investigate.

407
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:59,193
So the smart play is
lower your weapons...

408
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:03,593
...allow us to pass, and salute me as I do.

409
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,099
Come on.

410
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,272
What did he do?

411
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,243
He stole money from a drug dealer...

412
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,248
...and he left three of his fellow
police officers to die.

413
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,484
Come on.

414
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,402
You got until midnight. That's it.

415
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,009
- They're gonna make her pay for helping me.
- Shut up.

416
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,976
- You can't just leave her.
- Shut up. It's not my problem.

417
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:53,944
Come on. Just keep moving.

418
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,318
Is this more of your handiwork?

419
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:05,951
You been a busy boy.

420
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:08,753
Come on.

421
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,465
You got ajail cell in here?

422
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:21,535
Oh, we've got better than that.

423
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:40,553
<i>- Here's your dinero.
- You son of a bitch.</i>

424
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,907
Good work, lieutenant. That's for you.

425
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:03,340
Now, this money was supposed to be
delivered two days ago in La Paz.

426
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,544
Do you know where it was headed?

427
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:06,881
Ah.

428
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,156
See that it gets there.

429
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,827
No problemo.

430
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,467
<i>Apparently, I can trust you more
than any of these incompetent pendejos.</i>

431
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,000
<i>Bunch of pendejos!</i>

432
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,898
<i>You hear that? You're all pendejos.</i>

433
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,375
Yeah, you.

434
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:34,875
So it was you that set us up in the desert.
Huh? That phony stop and search.

435
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:38,042
- You ordered those mooks to kill us.
- Yep.

436
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,254
They were good cops.

437
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,790
This had nothing to do with them.

438
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,960
What the hell are you talking about?

439
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:53,924
This was all about you.
You're too damn good at yourjob.

440
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,189
Do you trust that cop
to deliver the money?

441
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,158
He'll do it.

442
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,923
He just saw what happens to cops
that steal our money.

443
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,191
Hmm.

444
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,362
<i>And what should we do
with the pinche gringo?</i>

445
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,506
Kill him.

446
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,768
Slowly.

447
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:04,789
Come on.

448
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,226
Son of a...

449
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,601
Yes.

450
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,681
Hey, what's the problem?

451
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:26,747
- I'm talking to you, asshole.
It's the fucking gringo.

452
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,459
- He got away.
- Son of a bitch.

453
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:29,776
Motherfucker.

454
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:42,921
Shit.

455
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:53,004
Son of a bitch.

456
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,217
Motherfucker.

457
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,899
Come on, West.

458
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,409
Son of a bitch.

459
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,252
Shit!

460
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,731
Come on!

461
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,368
Fucking kill you, West.

462
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,877
Let's get the fuck out of here.

463
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,973
Shit. My gun.

464
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,915
Fuck. Come on.

465
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,197
Come on. Come on. Come on.

466
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:04,265
Fuck.

467
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,271
Okay.

468
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:32,043
Three good cops dead.

469
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,663
You got me.

470
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,268
Four cops' lives ruined.

471
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:54,273
And you take the money and you run,
you son of a bitch.

472
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,641
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

473
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,414
Look...

474
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:06,153
I'm just trying to get out of this war.

475
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,488
Same as you.

476
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:13,418
No. Same war, different sides.

477
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:16,361
You think you're different from me?

478
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,323
Not at all.

479
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,796
You betrayed your brothers
the moment you took this money.

480
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,277
You gonna arrest me?

481
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,157
Attaboy.

482
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:26,991
No.

483
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,298
No!

484
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,079
You had your chance. Huh?

485
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,918
- No! No! No!
- Shh, shh.

486
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,225
No!

487
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,098
No!

488
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:17,642
Hmm?

489
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:25,183
Hmm?

490
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:46,272
Anita.

491
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:50,077
It didn't have to end like this, Anita.

492
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:53,978
You could have just taken the money.

493
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:56,256
Like all of these people.

494
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,123
You are more stubborn
than your father was.

495
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:25,514
We're gonna have to kill you. Huh?

496
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,112
You already have.

497
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,450
Shut the fuck up. Hmm?

498
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,300
Come on! Do it!

499
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,663
The man is here.

500
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:14,392
Where is he?

501
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,161
There.

502
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,262
Where the fuck is he?

503
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:33,014
Shoot him. Come on. Shoot him.

504
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:37,248
Come on, shoot him.

505
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,922
Shoot him. Come on.

506
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,959
Come on, shoot him.

507
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,752
Come on, shoot him.

508
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:05,740
Fuck you and fuck La M.

509
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:11,442
Thanks, kid.

510
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:32,063
Come into my town.

511
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,370
Steal my money.

512
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:39,370
Kill my men.

513
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:05,597
Scourge of this town.

514
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,758
This is a heroin highway.

515
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:35,092
You're just a man.

516
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:42,165
There's nothing you can do to stop this.

517
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,311
You can kill everyone in El Fronteras...

518
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,609
...but you can't kill every gangster
in Mexico.

519
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:51,251
We'll just keep coming
and coming and coming.

520
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,747
Shut the hell up.

521
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:58,620
Nobody's listening.

522
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,736
Anna.

523
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,160
Shit.

524
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,029
Nice.

525
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:40,387
Your father would be very proud of you.

526
01:31:59,881 --> 01:32:01,781
I'm sorry about the bar, Anna.

527
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,119
It's okay.

528
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,859
I'll build a new one.

529
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,497
So, uh...

530
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:23,830
...this is a lot of money.

531
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:26,197
What will you do with it?

532
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:30,906
I was thinking about buying
a really big glass of water.

533
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:49,089
You can keep the change.

534
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:11,016
- There you go, ladies.
Thank you.

535
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:37,202
How about a margarita on the house?

536
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,211
I didn't think they served margaritas
around here.

537
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:46,649
Can we get another round
over here, please?

538
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:48,721
Of course. I'll be right there.

539
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,379
The tourists request them.

540
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,523
A margarita sounds pretty good
right about now.

541
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:59,228
What happened to Acapulco?

542
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:03,170
- Acapulco?
