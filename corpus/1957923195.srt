00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,034
where people that
don't have a fireplace,

359
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,842
they like to put up
a video of a fire?

360
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,109
Yeah.

361
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,311
I make those. I put
them on YouTube.

362
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,579
Oh, no kidding?

363
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,181
Hey, we use that
down at the station.

364
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,249
Yeah. It's got
Christmas music on.

365
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,586
Yeah, my daughter uses
one, too, to study.

366
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:33,192
She's got ADHD.

367
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,324
Well, uh, I did one
last year in Bali.

368
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:39,562
It was a, uh... Like a
beach bonfire situation.

369
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,029
Pretty cool.

370
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:45,300
Huh. Is that like a
job or just a hobby?

371
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,070
Um, I make some
money at it, yeah.

372
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:51,406
He has at least a million views.

373
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:53,675
I'm in the wrong
business. [ Chuckles ]

374
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:58,380
Well, If you recorded that log,
I would definitely erase it.

375
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:01,116
Anyway, we'll let
you nice people

376
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:03,146
get back to your vacation.

377
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,355
But if you need anything,
anything at all,

378
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,892
here's my card.

379
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,526
Absolutely.

380
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:15,497
Yep, we will be in touch.

381
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:18,333
Have a good night, Sheriff.

382
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:21,937
Deputy. Ohh, watch your step.

383
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:23,706
Appreciate all you guys do.

384
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,775
Protecting and serving.

385
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:27,009
Your tax dollars at
work, by the way.

386
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:28,776
Like, what was that?
[ Guns clicking ]

387
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:31,446
Zoe: That is so
disturbing. Yeah, I know!

388
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,627
It's like I hate it when these
men in positions of power

389
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:37,252
just believe all this,
like, superstitious shit.

390
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,387
I'm talking about the killing.

391
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:40,767
There's a killer
on the loose, Alex!

392
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,358
Right, yes, I know
about, yeah, that.

393
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:44,659
But, you know, honestly,

394
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,362
I wouldn't really
worry about that, babe.

395
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,332
I mean, most murders
are family disputes,

396
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,067
statistically speaking.

397
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:54,069
Right?

398
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,770
And if it is a serial killer,

399
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,539
which, despite all the
true-crime documentaries

400
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:02,577
would have you believe,
is super, super rare,

401
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:06,514
he's probably very
far away from here.

402
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,483
Babe, it can't be that rare.

403
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:10,452
There's many true-crime
shows about them.

404
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:12,399
You really need to stop watching
that shit before you go to bed

405
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:13,588
with as anxious as you are.

406
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:16,191
Ugh, God. I have to
be prepared, Alex.

407
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,693
Always be prepared, right,

408
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:20,028
my little... My
little Boy Scout.

409
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:21,766
Come here.

410
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:30,706
What do you say I
relight that log?

411
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,273
Or... Or...

412
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:35,271
Or pick a different one?

413
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,479
The sheriff said don't.
The sheriff said don't?

414
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:41,422
The sheriff said don't, Alex. Okay, alright,
listen, I'm going to ask you something.

415
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,853
I'm going to ask you
something. Be honest with me.

416
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:48,757
Do you believe that
that log is cursed?

417
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:50,325
Hmm?

418
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,260
I don't know what
to believe. Okay?

419
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,795
I-I-I think the sheriff
might be watching.

420
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,599
He might see the smoke. Okay,
alright. Well, fuck me, then right?

light a fire in a cabin

423
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,411
Yeah.

424
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:14,216
You never answered
me, by the way.

425
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,955
Answered what?

Can we... Can we just
talk about that later?

428
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:25,360
What does that mean?
What does that mean, Zo?

429
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,006
I'm just... I mean,
like, do you want to?

430

Do you not want to? Do you
want to think about it?

00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,265
Babe, I'm just
freaked out right now!

432
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:31,566
You're freaked out by who?

433
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:34,035
By... By Sheriff Bumfuck
and Deputy Cletus?

434
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:36,872
What? What? Are
you... A-Are you mad?

00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:40,041
No. No. No.

439
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:53,656
I love you and I
want to marry you.

440
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:55,891
I do, but I'm just scared.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

442
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,788
I'm... I'm fucking scared right
now. Look, I-I'm scared, too!

443
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,997
It's a huge step. I know that.

I-I-I know.

00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,836
Alex, no! It's...
It's not that.

00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:10,939
Okay? You're... You're always
so just happy-go-lucky.

And... And I have my shit.

00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,675
What if it gets worse, huh?

449
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:17,077
What if it gets
worse like my mom?

450
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:19,693
What if I grind you down the way my mom did my
dad? Okay, you're not... you're not like your mom.

You're not like your mother!
You're nothing like your mother.

not your dad, Zoe.

I'm not.

454
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:28,652
Look at me.

455
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,721
Look at me.

456
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,730
You're not going
to grind me down.

457
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:37,066
You might... You
might polish me, huh?

458
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:39,434
Polish each other.

459
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:42,371
Like... Like little diamonds.

460

Don't you... Don't you just feel

461
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,541
like you should be
with someone happier?

462
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,289
No. No. No. Wouldn't that make you
happy, to be with someone happier?

463
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:52,014
Huh? I want... I want you.

right things to say.

00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:05,927
I feel cursed.

468
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:08,396
Yes, like our friend the
log in the fireplace.

469
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:10,866
Don't joke. Don't
joke about that.

470
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,935
Okay.

471
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:15,670
It's... It's like
a... It's like, um...

472
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,072
It's like a sense of doom.

473
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,541
Like I'm always waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

474

Like, what if...

at a certain location
at a certain time

477
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:25,981
and then a tree
happens to fall on us

478
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,294
and had you not
been married to me,

479
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,494
none of this would
have happened.

480
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:30,552
You would have never died, Alex.

481
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:33,088
Zoe, that is so
completely off the rails.

482
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,089
I-I-I'm going to ask
you something right now

483
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:39,761
and I really, really don't
want you to get angry at me.

484
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,263
Can you promise to try?
I-I'm going to try.

485
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:45,434
But you prefaced it really
strongly. Do you think...

486
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:48,536
that maybe...

487
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,542
we should up your medication?

It's not about my meds,
Alex! Okay. Alright.

491
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:09,858
It's not about my meds. Okay.

492
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,426

Alright. Look, I'm sorry.

494
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,730
A lot of fucked-up shit
has happened to you

in your life, babe.

you to be happy.

The planet is dying, Alex.

502

Go pick out china patterns?

Do you have it in lilac?
Do you have it in blue?"

a child in this hellhole?

Okay. Alright.

507
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,004
How do you... How do you
even plan for the future

508
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:58,651
when there is none? Alright,
listen, listen! Everything...

509
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,654
How do you plan for the
future when there isn't one?

510
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,310
Every era of time...
Nothing matters!

511
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:05,447
Every era of time seems shitty
when you're in it, okay?

512
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:06,959
That's just an
objective point of fact.

513
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:09,917
Everybody believes that
about their era, right?

514
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:12,287
Okay, just imagine, like,
living in World War I or II.

515
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:14,088
Oh! Ooh! Pick an era!

516
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:16,336
As a black woman during the Civil
War. Oh! As a black woman, huh?

517
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,971
Don't... Don't do that.
Don't do that! Okay.

518
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:20,095
I'm making a very cogent
point right now, okay.

519
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:22,463
Ohh. Cogent.

520
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:23,964
I just think that we are living

521
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:27,469
at a pretty good little
pocket of time in history.

522
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:31,640
You know, uh,
comparatively speaking.

523
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:35,377
I guess my point is that
there's always going to be

524
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:36,845
shitty aspects of life, babe.

525
00:24:36,914 --> 00:24:38,480
No matter what era you live in.

526
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:41,549
And you just gotta... You
just gotta find the good.

527
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,719
You know, you got to
lean into the good.

528
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,686
