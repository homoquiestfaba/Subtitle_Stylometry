1
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,664
(gunshots )

2
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,529
Man: Stop!

3
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,504
He's running towards--

4
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,069
( tires screech )

5
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,589
Stop!

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,330
On the ground!

7
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,583
( man screaming )

8
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,216
What happened?

9
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,773
( heart beating )

10
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,809
Here on the remote island of Kuttyhunk

11
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,016
globally famed as a hotbed
for scientific research...

12
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,321
Proverbial gold has been found
in a new breed of pearl,

13
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,693
genetically engineered
by the innovative scientific community

14
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,789
that lives and runs
this tiny island.

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,199
Scientists from around the world
moved here after World War ll

16
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,726
as a meeting ground
for inventive minds.

17
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,705
Mason, famous for
controlling his image,

18
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,231
refused to comment
on this groundbreaking achievement.

19
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,335
Man:...Ieaving this reporter wondering,

20
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,711
if they can produce this,
what else are they capable of?

21
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,977
( heart monitor beeping )

22
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,448
Today is day one

23
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,482
of the Human Growth Project.

24
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,790
We believe that through
continued development

25
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,489
of parasitic research

26
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,464
we can provide humanity with a tool

27
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,467
that will remove the limitations

28
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,492
placed on us by our DNA.

29
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,835
Some people thought this
to be impossible until now.

30
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,369
This is important.

31
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,403
This is monumental.

32
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,176
And we have distribution

33
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,684
in six out of the eight major
territories--

34
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,515
quite an achievement.

35
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,279
We need to think even bigger.

36
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,019
We need to think global.

37
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,050
We need to think evolution.

38
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,652
Look at where we started

39
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,529
and look how far we have come.

40
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,466
I should acknowledge my niece
Amanda Lane,

41
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,834
without whom this would not
have been possible.

42
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,133
Behind this curtain--

43
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,164
( crash )

44
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,904
( screaming )

45
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,938
Run! Run!

46
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,577
We've managed to control
the outbreak.

47
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,883
There have been fewer
than two dozen deaths.

48
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,287
- ( screaming )
- In the pan is a layer of ocean water.

49
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,291
And since the island is
surrounded by salt water,

50
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,849
I think the mainland

51
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,918
will remain safe for quite some time.

52
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,935
But we are so close.

53
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,631
Amanda has the antidote.

54
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,004
We can reverse-engineer--

55
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,101
I can make this work.

56
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,135
This is sadly

57
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,170
part of the process.

58
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,206
Man: Oh my God!
Oh my God!

59
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,275
Get out of here!

60
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,990
Let me in! Let me in!

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,258
Oh, Jesus.

62
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,343
( screaming )

63
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,629
- Sarah, hey.
- Hey.

64
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,335
- It's nice to put a face with the name.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

65
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,345
Hi. How's everything
at the camp?

66
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,279
Fine, I guess.

67
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,646
- It's not that bad.
- What's not?

68
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,116
He's landsick.

69
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,948
Things are still moving.

70
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,580
Yeah, I don't feel too well either.

71
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,146
It is a little choppy out there.

72
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,125
You don't have to make
excuses for me.

73
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,059
- I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.

74
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,636
( quiet rock music playing )

75
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,134
Weird being back, huh?

76
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,871
A little.

77
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,469
I told you I'd take care of it.

78
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,447
No, it's good to get closure.

79
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,451
I'm glad you called. The compound's
kind of fallen apart over the years.

80
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,885
That's why I brought
my cleaning crew.

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,785
- Oh my God.
- How do you guys know each other?

82
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,383
Boyfriend, stepbrother, friend.

83
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,417
- Best friend.
- Best friend.

84
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,588
Should we show them
how we make out sometimes?

85
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,532
What? Like you guys don't want
to see us making out.

86
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,864
And you're Mason's niece?

87
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,234
He was my great uncle, yeah.

88
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,637
He and your mom are pretty famous
here on the island.

89
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,732
Jamie: Actually, my mom died here
when I was a kid.

90
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,007
But Marco got a call that Mason
had passed away and left his property.

91
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,536
So we're just here to clean it
and sell it.

92
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,675
- Is it worth a lot?
- It's worth $2 million, actually.

93
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,242
- No way.
- But the weirdest part is

94
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,778
that last month I was paying their rent
and this month they're millionaires.

95
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,188
- You're gonna let that go?
- I'm not saying you have to pay me--

96
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,714
- It's my fault.
- Justin.

97
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,626
No. I got sick
and they paid for me again.

98
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,323
He has low immunity.

99
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,389
I should be paying you back.

100
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,459
Don't worry about it, bro.
It'll work out.

101
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,767
And we're gonna pay back
your trust fund with interest.

102
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,240
Awesome.

103
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,059
( child whispering )

104
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,320
Do you hear that?

105
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,968
She's fine, baby.
Go to sleep.

106
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,718
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm fine.

107
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,817
I'm not worried, sweetie.
Come here.

108
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:20,231
( giggling )

109
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,394
They're awake.

110
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,394
Robert.

111
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,430
Honey, get up.

112
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,499
Robert: What?

113
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,540
Emily.

114
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,075
Emily, it's gonna be okay, baby.

115
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,712
We're gonna get you some help.

116
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,848
We're fine, Dad.

117
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,265
( screaming )

118
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,596
Daddy.

119
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,246
This place is worth $2 million?

120
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,683
Okay, well, I stayed up all night
making the CD

121
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,345
so that when we clean we could--

122
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,480
Wait, you said tonight was
chill time.

123
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,513
But it's French '80s disco.

124
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,186
French '80s disco?
Jamie, I'm gonna go to my room

125
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,752
take off my shoes,
tickle my accordion and go to bed.

126
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,787
- And tomorrow we can do--
- Kristin.

127
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,731
Tomorrow we can do it, Jamie.

128
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,732
Am I right?

129
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,638
- No.
- I deem this weekend

130
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,112
you shall be with a mustache.

131
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,842
- No.
- It's a mustache weekend, Justin.

132
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,749
- Kristin.
- And it looks so perfect.

133
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,843
You look like a man.

134
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,152
Oh, do you think you could grab
my accordion?

135
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,317
It's too heavy for me.

136
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,657
Thank you.
But be careful with it.

137
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,686
It means a lot.

138
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,702
Why did you even invite her?

139
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,706
Because that chick would
body-block a bus for me,

140
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,731
and she hates
public transportation.

141
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,005
Come on, baby, this is me.

142
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,775
I just--
I want to sell this place, you know,

143
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,511
and have it be done.

144
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,882
You are in luck,

145
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,979
'cause I am here--
the fixer of all things.

146
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,546
Yeah, after you break them.

147
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,388
Yeah, but I fix them though.

148
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,326
Did you hear anything?

149
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,421
No, sorry, babe.

150
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,464
- Slimy Toads.
- Huh?

151
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,163
Slimy Toads--
it's the name of our bunk.

152
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,195
So why don't you make your call

153
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,799
and then meet me there...

154
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,469
naked?

155
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,138
I like Slimy Toads.

156
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,603
( applause )

157
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,549
- Mommy.
- Jamie.

158
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,259
I'm so proud of you.

159
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,621
I like it.

160
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,533
How is this any different
from the last room?

161
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,266
Well, you're here, for one.

162
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,206
So?

163
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,643
So I'm scared to be alone, Justin.

164
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,806
I don't want to get hurt again.

165
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,316
I don't know. I get scared.

166
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,649
- ( screams )
- What?

167
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,177
I totally got you.

168
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,190
Bottom or top?

169
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,817
I like it on top.

170
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,885
Good. It's all yours.

171
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,864
No, Justin, I said
that I like it on top--

172
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,390
Justin: Could you not--?
I came here to get some quiet,

173
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,894
not to be told what to do
by some bossy boss lady.

174
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,336
You know, some people think
I'm fun.

175
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,367
Good.

176
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,209
Fuck.

177
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,249
( car engine starts )

178
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,023
Hey, excuse me.
How are you?

179
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,691
Do you happen to know
where a local pay phone is?

180
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,299
What the hell?

181
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,115
( Marco snoring )

182
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,472
Moron.

183
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:56,053
On the TV I saw a man
selling second chance

184
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,684
I thought, "What kind of sucker
needs to buy self-confidence?"

185
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:05,390
I sit alone on a Friday night
in boxer briefs

186
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,490
Saying I realize--

187
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,434
( group singing )

188
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,959
Oh, this is incredible.

189
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,161
Gina.

190
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,432
No, I mean you told me
about them but--

191
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,564
We've got to figure out
how this is happening again

192
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,166
so we can stop it. Listen.

193
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,202
Infection, cellular lymphomatosis
fusion, reproduction.

194
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,441
Gina, these things infect.
They ingest.

195
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,883
They multiply and destroy.
There's no middle ground here.

196
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,547
Maybe it's some kind of mutation
gestating in a plant or a bug.

197
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,353
I mean, parasites live
just about anywhere.

198
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,552
A fish maybe?

199
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,562
No, probably not a fish,
at least not saltwater anyway.

200
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,827
Watch.
Watch what happens.

201
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,927
Here. Salt kills parasites--
their chief vulnerability.

202
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,404
Well, handy that we're surrounded
by salt water.

203
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,374
Talk to me about
the first outbreak then.

204
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,401
Well, parasites have been
used in science

205
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,276
for hundreds of years now.

206
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,611
Tapeworms are utilized
to keep people thin.

207
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,446
Maggots are used
for exfoliation.

208
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,918
Parasites-- microscopic parasites

209
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,421
can be given a simple
set of instructions.

210
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:42,018
They then burrow into their host
and they can manipulate their DNA.

211
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,359
We started with shellfish,

212
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,591
engineering oysters
that produced

213
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,192
perfect, lustrous
and round pearls.

214
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,464
And money from the pearls
funded further research.

215
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,994
We set out to make
the perfect human.

216
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,837
And at first we were successful.
They became strong,

217
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:01,710
their senses heightened.
The subjects became intuitive.

218
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,773
But we made one major
miscalculation.

219
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,650
The parasites needed to feed

220
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,280
and consumed the host
from the inside.

221
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,313
( knocks )

222
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,290
Okay, you can't tell me that
and then leave me alone in here.

223
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,127
Gina, it'll be fine.
I'll just be a minute. You're okay.

224
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,530
But--

225
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,264
( door closes )

226
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,152
I'm not gonna be able to keep this
a secret much longer.

227
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,684
People are gonna think--

228
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,822
People will think
what I tell them to think.

229
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,834
- Things have changed, Larkin.
- You forget who you're talking to.

230
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,768
Are you questioning
my loyalty here, Jake?

231
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,862
Oh, I'm questioning
a lot more than that, Doc.

232
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,068
How dare you bring Jamie onto the island
without consulting me?

233
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,541
If there's even a chance

234
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,669
that she can bring us
to the antidote, we've got to try.

235
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,407
You still believe that fairy tale?

236
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,075
No, this is our burden, Macavire.

237
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,584
We said that coming in
and I'm saying it now.

238
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,712
Bringing innocents into this
is madness.

239
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,483
No, not bringing them would be.

240
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,320
We have a larger responsibility.

241
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,657
I wouldn't be lecturing anybody
on responsibility, Doc.

242
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,094
( men continue arguing )

243
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,268
Stanley, please.

244
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,362
It's over.
It was a freak incident.

245
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,134
It's been 20 years.

246
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,007
That's what concerns me.

247
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,068
You'll do as you're told.

248
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,443
Jamie leaves now.

249
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,508
Wouldn't be the first time
you've been wrong, Larkin.

250
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,781
Mm-hmm.

251
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,923
( Gina screams )
Help me!

252
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,351
( straining )

253
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,855
Help me!

254
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,092
Help me!

255
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,128
( cocks gun )

256
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,650
Justin!

257
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,622
- What?
- You're not very good at that.

258
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,489
You try it.

259
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,221
I saw some townspeople today.

260
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,424
Oh, yeah? Did you paint mustaches
on their faces too?

261
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,762
- No, actually it was really creepy--
- I don't care.

262
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,030
Are you still mad about that?

263
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,297
Beginner's luck.

264
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,537
And I'm not mad.

265
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,805
Why do you need
to be alone so bad?

266
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,848
Why can't you be?

267
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,386
We have orders.

268
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,482
Goody.

269
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,939
This can't be done.

270
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,206
You've already done it.

271
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,612
Amanda: On shellfish.

272
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,242
What you're talking about
is something completely different.

273
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,774
Mason: I have faith.

274
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,083
Well, I have doubts, Mason.

275
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,750
It's too big. It's too dangerous.
And there's no time for--

276
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,317
Mason: Necessity is
the mother of invention.

277
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,226
Right?

278
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,460
Jamie, stand up.
Let me see how big you've gotten.

279
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,896
Okay, look.

280
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,406
( knocks on door )

281
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,504
Coming.

282
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,410
- Jamie Ackerman?
- Yes.

283
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,681
My name is Larkin Holberman
from the city council.

284
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,951
We know of your
great uncle's passing

285
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,049
and we wanted to extend
our most heartfelt condolences.

286
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,426
Mason was a friend.

287
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,657
Thank you.

288
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,995
So I'm pleased to inform you

289
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,059
the City of Kuttyhunk
has agreed to offer you

290
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,504
$75,000 for the rights
to this land.

291
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,667
No, thank you.
We have more substantial offers.

292
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,937
From other islanders?

293
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,501
No, from the mainland.

294
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,446
But Miss Ackerman, you only have
the rights to this property.

295
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,509
Ownership can only be exchanged
between islanders.

296
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,543
No.

297
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,988
I actually have this.

298
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,491
Uh, let's see...

299
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,589
Okay, right here, actually.
In the state of Maine--

300
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,897
I'm afraid the local statute
takes precedence in cases like this.

301
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,766
Have you discussed this
with a lawyer?

302
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,237
No, I talked to a real estate agent.

303
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,173
I suggest that you talk
to a lawyer.

304
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,803
Are you saying that I have
no course of action?

305
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:37,076
Well, you could take it up
with the head of the city council.

306
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,811
- Great. Who is that?
- That would be me.

307
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,116
This land is worth $2 million.

308
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,249
- I'm afraid my hands are tied.
- Are they?

309
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,522
But we do have $75,000 for you.

310
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,097
This won't even cover our debt.

311
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,258
It's better than nothing,
Miss Ackerman.

312
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,927
Think it over.

313
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,698
And I am truly sorry.

314
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,104
Enjoy the ham.

315
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:20,318
I was thinking about it,
and I think we should just spend it all.

316
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,053
Marco--

317
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,890
Humor me.
How would you spend it?

318
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:35,103
A 50-day 50-state shopping spree.

319
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,937
Ooh, reckless spending.

320
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,966
I like it.

321
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,343
What is that?

322
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,185
( indistinct conversation )

323
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,319
( coughing )

324
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,331
Hey, did you bring
your medicine with you?

325
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,627
I'm fine.

326
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,365
Dude, you know we're alone
on this island.

327
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,201
I'm really sorry if I pissed you off
or something,

328
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,674
but we should probably
try to make the best of it.

329
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,636
We can play bullsnit.

330
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,044
Bullsnit?

331
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,072
It's this game
where I say something,

332
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,016
and if you think it's fake
you say "bullsnit."

333
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,315
And if it is fake,
then I'll make a funny face.

334
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,618
And if it's not fake, they you'll
make a funny face.

335
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:29,093
Okay, I think this game
sounds dumb.

336
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,152
How about this one?

337
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,131
I had a thing with Marco
before Jamie did.

338
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,725
Bullsnit.

339
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,635
- Oh my God.
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,104
Face.

341
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,401
Kristin: Good.

342
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,206
Justin: What happened?

343
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,406
I can't tell you because that's not
the rules of the game.

344
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,914
Your turn.

345
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,646
Okay, this is--
this is kind of messed up,

346
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,881
but when me and Jamie
were kids--

347
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,720
Wait, your dad married her mom?

348
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,419
- Yeah.
- Okay.

349
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,290
After she left the island

350
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,558
she came to live with us
for three months.

351
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,964
And we used to

352
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,764
experiment sexually

353
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,033
a little bit.

354
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,973
Oh my God.

355
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,498
Face.

356
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,705
Oh my God,
that was pretty good.

357
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,448
In all seriousness though,

358
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:32,354
I know I've been
kind of aggressive with you,

359
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,518
and it's because I like you.

360
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,790
And we only have
two days left, so...

361
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,319
Kristin--

362
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,025
And I'm snitting.

363
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,502
It's just I'm not the kind of guy
that gets together with girls,

364
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:48,233
you know, just for--
you know, that--

365
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,501
For fun?

366
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,202
Yeah. It's not you.

367
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,678
It's just, you know, 48 hours just--

368
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,705
I don't think, you know, probably--

369
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,444
Is that cool?

370
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,475
Totally.

371
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,395
Bullsnit.

372
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,829
You know, I would say like,

373
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,734
if I can drive six miles
without pushing the brake,

374
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,295
then Johnny Dexter
will ask me out.

375
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,897
And?

376
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,876
I mean, it works usually.
Like I would say,

377
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,311
if I can hold my breath
until I see a blue Prius

378
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,645
then I would lose five pounds.

379
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,378
And you did?

380
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,648
No, not every time.

381
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,383
- I wouldn't always see a blue Prius.
- ( laughs )

382
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,654
Okay, so you're saying
if I could swim across that lake,

383
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,025
then I'll get whatever I want?

384
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,428
No, that's not what I'm saying.

385
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,557
There has to be an aspect
of randomness to it,

386
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,060
Iike if you could tread water
until you see a bird--

387
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,698
--then I'll get whatever I want.

388
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,539
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,841
Well, okay then.

390
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,780
Ohh-hh.

391
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,942
- I'm doing it.
- ( laughs )

392
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,255
Holy Christ, it is cold.

393
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,789
Holy what?

394
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,700
Watch out for sharks.

395
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,297
What?

396
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,638
Jamie: Mason and I used to
play this game all the time.

397
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,234
He called it "the hunt."

398
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,008
It reminds me--
my uncle used to distract me.

399
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,174
He used to stick up his left hand.

400
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,081
And if you focus
on the left hand,

401
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,416
you don't see what
the right hand is doing.

402
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,888
That's fascinating.

403
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,948
We're missing something.

404
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,471
Kristin: Maybe it's not meant to be.

405
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:14,349
No, I got a few more hours in me.

406
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,579
Really?

407
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,087
No, I'm giving up right now.

408
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,147
Kristin: I'm getting hungry.

409
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,884
Look!

410
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,191
Justin: What? Oh.

411
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,663
What does that mean?

412
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,598
I don't know.
It had to be while treading water.

413
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,965
Really?

414
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,867
Yeah, I don't know.
It's how l--

415
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,166
Really?

416
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,237
( chuckles )
Come here. You're shivering.

417
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,644
No, I'm fine.

418
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,739
Here. Is that better?

419
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,011
Yeah, thanks.

420
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,177
- Does that help?
- Yeah, I think so.

421
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,655
Oh, I forgot that you don't
hook up with girls just for fun.

422
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,686
Screw it.

423
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,308
I'm quick.

424
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,213
Yeah, me too.

425
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,257
( exclaims )

426
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,434
Justin.

427
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,405
Come here.

428
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,006
Put your hand on my neck?

429
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,430
That's anticlimactic.

430
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,272
Is there anything fun?

431
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,175
This is kind of fun.

432
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,613
Wow, it's beautiful.

433
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,316
( voices whispering )

434
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,490
Hmm.

435
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,738
What's in there?

436
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,675
Pictures.

437
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,111
Oh, wow.

438
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,139
I got it.

439
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,853
And now I'd like to introduce

440
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,878
the man of the hour

441
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,824
and someone I am proud
to call my friend,

442
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,157
Mason Lane.

443
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,219
I know this.

444
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,755
- Mason: Thank you.
- This is important.

445
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,098
Mason: Before we continue,

446
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,196
I should acknowledge my niece
Amanda Lane,

447
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,571
without whom this would not
have been possible.

448
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,177
Jamie, you guys,
something's wrong with Justin.

449
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,848
Now in order for lntercorps
to continue to expand

450
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,448
at its desired rate,

451
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,425
we need to think bigger.

452
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,724
We need to think global.

453
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,322
We need to think evolution.

454
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,559
Behind this curtain--

455
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,159
( crash )

456
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,331
( screaming )

457
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,704
( all shouting )

458
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,841
Mason: We need to think
evolution.

459
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,716
Parasites feed on adrenalin.

460
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,983
And once they acquire the taste,

461
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,958
they grow, consuming it
from the host.

462
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,894
This perfect strand

463
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,056
will be ready in months;,

464
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,261
not years, not decades--
in months.

465
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,395
It is the key

466
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,701
to our continued evolution.

467
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,231
Intercorps can bring this
to the world.

468
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,641
Imagine the possibilities.

469
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,671
I beg you not to stop us
from completing our task.

470
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,515
It is Adam's rib.

471
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,315
Was he breathing?

472
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,582
I don't know.
He was scared.

473
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,147
He just started shaking,
so I came to get you guys.

474
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,624
Where were you?

475
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,354
It was right here.

476
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,863
Justin!
Justin!

477
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,060
Justin! Justin!

478
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,869
What's going on, buddy?
Can you talk?

479
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,738
I'm so cold.
It's ripping me.

480
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,367
( screams )

481
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,344
- What was that?
- We gotta get him to camp, come on.

482
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,846
- What the fuck was that?
- You're scaring him. Help me out.

483
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,280
( coughing )

484
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,747
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

485
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,344
Don't be sorry.
We're gonna get you help.

486
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,184
Marco: Help me out.
Help me out.

487
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,890
Tell me exactly what happened.

488
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,623
We were near the water
and then he went into the water.

489
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,893
- Maybe the lake's contaminated.
- Did you see that thing in his stomach?

490
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,332
- I saw it too, maybe a muscle spasm.
- Is he getting sick again?

491
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,063
- Let's not think that.
- Did you see any signs?

492
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,968
- I don't know what to look for.
- Where are his pills?

493
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,734
- Jamie: He gets shots now.
- Marco: He needs a doctor.

494
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,967
I'm getting help.

495
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,943
( grunting )

496
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,945
( Jamie knocking ) Sarah,
there's something wrong with Justin.

497
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,652
I'm gonna run down to the dock,
see if I get any service.

498
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,289
I should clean off maybe.

499
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,526
Yeah, it's fine.
He's not going anywhere.

500
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,932
I'll be back soon.

501
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,697
Hang in there, buddy.

502
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,366
( door closes )

503
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,847
Are we being followed?

504
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,333
Jamie: This is the closest place
with a phone?

505
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,236
Sarah: Yeah.

506
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,298
I'll be right back.

507
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,579
( knocking )
Hello?

508
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,419
Hello, is anyone there?
Please, my brother is sick.

509
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,688
Can I just use your phone?

510
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,921
Please.

511
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,122
( knocking )
I can see you.

512
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,065
Please, I just need your help.
My brother is sick.

513
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,534
Hello?

514
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,103
I can see you.

515
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,767
Please, my brother is sick.

516
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,119
( humming a tune )

517
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,483
( Justin wheezes )

518
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,893
- Jamie: Should we go to the cops?
- Sarah: They're idiots.

519
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,490
We're not going to the cops.
Dr. Mac will know what to do.

520
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,441
( playing accordion )

521
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,843
( man breathing deeply )

522
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,928
( stops playing )

523
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,261
( air hissing )

524
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,798
( man breathing deeply )

525
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,302
( water running )

526
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,782
Nam myoho renge kyo.

527
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,685
Nam myoho
renge kyo.

528
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,485
Nam myoho renge kyo.

529
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,219
Nam myoho
renge kyo.

530
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,189
( continues chanting )

531
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,067
( continues chanting )

532
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,848
( door squeaks )

533
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,351
( screams )

534
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,511
Are you okay?

535
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,546
You're better now.

536
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,786
Me?

537
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,885
I'm fine.

538
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,294
Did you break the door?

539
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,323
Uh...

540
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,267
( chuckles )

541
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,636
- You got a little--
- What?

542
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,336
- A little something.
- Oh.

543
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,345
I don't think you finished,
but I'll do it for you.

544
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,475
A little mustache.

545
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,685
A mustache.

546
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,650
( woman speaks indistinctly )

547
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,720
Really?

548
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,560
Kristin: What?

549
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,761
Well, round two?

550
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,762
The shower's ready.

551
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,880
Jamie: Dr. Mac's house, right?

552
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,679
Sarah: Yeah.

553
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,982
- Wait.
- What?

554
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,011
Look.

555
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,820
Kristin over walkie-talkie:
Hello?

556
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,884
Hey, it's Jamie.

557
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,726
Kristin: Thank God. I've been trying
to reach you for, like, five minutes.

558
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,664
Justin is okay.

559
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,996
What happened?

560
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,969
I don't know.
He just-- he got better.

561
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,904
Really? That's great.
We're headed home.

562
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,324
( walkie-talkie hisses )

563
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,692
Hello, is anybody out there?
Can you hear me?

564
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,124
Hello, is anybody out there?

565
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,567
Can you read me?

566
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,842
( clock ticking )

567
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,982
( clock ticking louder )

568
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,536
( ticking loudly )

569
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,293
( ticking quieter )

570
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,781
( muffled voice speaks )

571
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,292
( dog barking )

572
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,535
- Man: Oh, yeah.
- ( wood creaking )

573
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,673
( man and woman moaning )

574
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:17,896
( Kristin breathing deeply )

575
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,130
( clock ticking quietly )

576
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:33,939
( heart beating )

577
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,283
( noises stop )

578
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,121
I'm sleeping.

579
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,715
( rock music playing,
people chattering )

580
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,512
What can I do you for?

581
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,177
Whiskey.

582
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,732
Excuse me.

583
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,368
I'm sorry to interrupt,

584
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,401
but can I talk to you for a second?

585
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,880
I'm busy here.

586
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,408
I've never really
done this before,

587
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,284
but I see you with your friends,

588
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,085
surrounded by all this stuff,

589
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,150
these people, and I don't know,

590
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,061
you seem interesting.

591
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,088
Really?

592
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,123
I could be totally wrong,

593
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,465
but I see someone who's stuck,

594
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,494
wanting,

595
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,371
waiting to get away from here,

596
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,138
to be something,

597
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,772
someone whom you forgot to be.

598
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,544
This guy, man.

599
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,144
He's treating you poorly.

600
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,589
You should leave him.

601
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,456
I'm not saying that I can
help you get there or anything.

602
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,488
I just feel like maybe
we're the same, you know?

603
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,830
Two little people

604
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,735
wanting a chance to be different.

605
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,339
Yeah, you got me all figured out.

606
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,172
No. No.

607
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,973
Please, this is ridiculous.

608
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:27,211
- Really?
- Yeah.

609
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,412
Then why is your heart racing?

610
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,051
( rapid heartbeat )

611
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,558
Is there a problem?

612
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:38,390
Only if you want one.

613
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,953
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Andy.

614
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,365
Yeah? I don't think so. I saw this guy
physically grabbing on you.

615
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,892
As if there's any other way.

616
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,600
What did you say?

617
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:56,204
I said you're a small-town boy
who should be moving on now.

618
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,407
You're the one
who needs moving,

619
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,848
pussy.

620
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,444
I sure as shit ain't gonna
let you sit here

621
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,682
and put your filthy hands
all over my girl.

622
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,555
Well, I'm sorry.

623
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,655
You're right.

624
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,994
Goddamn right I'm right.

625
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,398
We should go outside.

626
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,270
You guys, this is so stupid.

627
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:22,829
Shut up.

628
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,569
This asshole can't just walk in here
with his stupid-ass sunglasses

629
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,440
and act like
he owns the place, no.

630
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,910
You can walk away from this.

631
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,938
( chuckles )
You sure do talk tough.

632
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,540
Why don't you show me
what you got?

633
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,747
But that's not how it works.

634
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,448
You have to come to me.

635
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,547
'Cause you're scared?

636
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,393
( laughs )

637
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,523
That's what I thought.

638
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,603
Hey!

639
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,637
No harm no foul.
Have a drink on me.

640
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:28,763
Seriously, guys,
I don't want to hurt you.

641
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,509
All right.

642
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,316
This has been fun.

643
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,344
That was incredible.

644
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,307
No no.

645
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,438
He's drunk.

646
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,641
Come on, let's go, okay?

647
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,791
Wait wait, let me see your eyes.

648
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,006
- You're freezing.
- I'm fine.

649
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,769
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

650
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,657
What is this?

651
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,221
- It's nothing.
- ( straining )

652
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,145
( knocks on door )

653
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,555
Just a second.

654
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,990
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

655
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,758
You didn't have to do that.

656
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,737
Oh, yes, I did.
You had us worried there for a minute.

657
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,899
Yeah.

658
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,100
But you're better.

659
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:48,077
Much.

660
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,739
Here you go.

661
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,612
Your mom used to make my dad
breakfast in bed.

662
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,380
What?

663
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,415
Yes, she would--

664
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,859
she would cut a flower
and put it in a vase

665
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,557
and surround it with
salt and pepper shakers

666
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:11,089
and make egg in the hole.

667
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:14,160
Yeah, egg in the hole.

668
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,905
I remember

669
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:23,879
that she did that
the day that they talked.

670
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,781
She didn't know
that I was there.

671
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,308
I was just playing
by the side of the bed and--

672
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,415
And she said that every time
she looked at me

673
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,448
she thought about my mom

674
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:38,120
and how much he loved her.

675
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,392
And then--

676
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,093
and then she said
that she couldn't stand it anymore.

677
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,568
And a few days later they--

678
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,970
they came to pick me up.

679
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,703
And-- yeah.

680
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:58,477
You know, you should be glad
you didn't grow up in that house.

681
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,881
It was

682
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,477
not good.

683
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,486
Justin, we're not getting money.

684
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,959
What?

685
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,292
I thought I could handle it, but--

686
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,890
I wanted to get you that treatment.

687
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,400
It's stupid, I know.

688
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,903
No. No, it's not stupid.

689
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,929
Jamie, you're my sister.

690
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,669
Step-sister.

691
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,542
But you're my blood.

692
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,549
Are you okay?

693
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,351
( panting )

694
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,154
Are you okay?

695
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,031
Yeah.

696
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,592
I guess I'm not 100% yet.

697
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,411
Where's Kristin?

698
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,280
Okay.

699
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,017
Thanks.

700
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,003
( screaming )

701
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,978
( footsteps )

702
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,328
- How's it going?
- Good.

703
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,308
Just chopping away.

704
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:20,832
Looking good.

705
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,038
Thanks.

706
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,537
I, uh...

707
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,118
This is awkward.

708
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,418
You're Jamie's only family and--

709
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,018
( screeching )

710
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,495
My God, why is this so hard?

711
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,521
Um...

712
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,556
I--

713
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,297
what I was asking is--

714
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,631
I was asking
for Jamie's hand in marriage.

715
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,437
Wow.

716
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,175
Yeah, it's--

717
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,046
this isn't easy for me.

718
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,984
Look at me. I'm a mess.

719
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,281
Relax.

720
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,381
- I mean, I brought the ring.
- ( screeching )

721
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,485
You know, I wasn't gonna ask,

722
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,019
but everything's been so tense
around here

723
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,327
that I thought, you know,
maybe I would, you know--

724
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:21,201
Listen, I'm late for meeting Kristin
by the lake,

725
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,535
but I'm happy to be brothers.

726
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,137
( exhales )

727
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,332
( screams )

728
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,600
( whispering ) Hello, Jamie?

729
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:03,970
Anybody? Hello?

730
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,945
Kristin over walkie-talkie:
Jamie, hello? Jamie?

731
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,387
( turns off sound )

732
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,220
Can you hear me?

733
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,460
( twig snaps )

734
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,570
( screaming )

735
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,820
- Hey.
- Hey.

736
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,198
Do you want to open
a military supply shop?

737
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,275
- We're not getting the money.
- Huh?

738
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,972
There was some ordinance.
And I tried to fix it,

739
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,573
but it got all messed up.
And there weren't any phones.

740
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,584
God, Marco.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

741
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,518
That's okay.

742
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,922
Listen, we can open a flea market.

743
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:07,487
- I want you to relax.
- Really?

744
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,556
Yeah, as long as you handle
the fleas.

745
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,000
I don't like bugs.

746
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:15,971
I was so nervous to tell you.

747
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:21,002
Well, speaking of nerves...

748
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,478
- ( knocks on door )
- Yes?

749
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,277
Excuse me.
Is someone here sick?

750
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,250
- Who wants to know?
- I found this note on my door.

751
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,877
Dr. Macavire.

752
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,286
Jamie Ackerman.
I used to play with your granddaughter.

753
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,882
Oh, yes, absolutely, of course.
It's great to see you again.

754
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,190
The note says that your brother
is unwell. Are you he?

755
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,628
No, he just left a minute ago.

756
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,360
- Hmm, that's a speedy recovery.
- Yeah, it was, actually.

757
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,858
Muscle spasms, shortness of breath,
disorientation, complaints of cold?

758
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:49,701
- How did you know?
- He just left, you say?

759
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:51,206
- Yeah.
- Where? How long ago?

760
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,004
To the lake, about five minutes ago.
We can catch up to him--

761
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,874
He's on foot
on the trail to the lake.

762
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,177
- What are you doing?
- Jamie, are these his sunglasses?

763
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,979
Jamie, he's diseased.
He's very sick.

764
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,009
And I need to see him
right away.

765
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,714
For what?

766
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,484
- To help him, of course.
- ( footsteps )

767
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,184
What's with all
the heavy artillery?

768
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,886
He already attacked one woman,
killed her.

769
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:14,021
She was last seen with him. Those
glasses were found next to the body.

770
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,088
- That doesn't prove anything.
- No, of course not,

771
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,396
but it does raise suspicions.

772
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:21,062
- Come on.
- Jamie.

773
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,014
Kristin!

774
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,645
Kristin!

775
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,198
( men chattering )

776
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,908
( Jamie exclaims )

777
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,333
( grunts )

778
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,939
( muffled screaming )

779
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,739
- Gun!
- ( two gunshots )

780
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,081
You're gonna kill us all.

781
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,986
No, man, just you.

782
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,454
Look at him.
He's sick.

783
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,757
( muffled scream )

784
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,769
( cocks gun )

785
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,601
( screams )

786
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,758
( screams )

787
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:21,375
( muffled screaming )

788
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,772
I'm sorry.

789
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,079
Oh my God.

790
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,752
Darren Francis Roberts,
Mary's son,

791
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,593
three kids, a good man.

792
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,892
( gunshot )

793
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,229
That he was.

794
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,600
How is this happening, Doc?

795
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:51,504
A half-life maybe.

796
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,030
I don't know.

797
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,737
Tape 'em.

798
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,918
Jake--

799
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,936
( water dripping )

800
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,313
Feeling better?

801
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,084
What is this place?

802
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:49,021
It's our sanctuary.

803
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,732
Who are you?

804
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:00,107
It's me, sweetheart.
Welcome home.

805
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,440
Oh my God.

806
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,504
Mason. Oh God.

807
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,983
You've grown.

808
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,455
Look.

809
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,870
One of God' overlooked
gifts to humanity,

810
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,501
Iike me.

811
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,347
( hissing, creature screeching )

812
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,712
This will keep you safe.

813
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:54,993
Mason, I can't do this anymore.

814
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,999
I know.

815
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,464
- What are you doing?
- What needs to be done.

816
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,167
Now she has to give us
the antidote.

817
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,307
You've lost it, Mason.

818
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:13,577
Tell me where the antidote is
so I can save you.

819
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:16,050
I destroyed it.

820
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,690
You killed her.

821
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,772
Mason: This solution

822
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:41,469
helps to keep the parasites at bay.

823
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,904
( Mason moans )

824
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,448
Your mother
had developed an antidote

825
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:53,216
that could have stopped
all of this.

826
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,815
But it doesn't matter now.

827
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,054
Even if you do know where it is,

828
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,222
you are the only one.

829
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,831
What's gonna happen to Justin?

830
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,634
I've been watching you.

831
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:14,109
I needed a diversion
to get you here alone.

832
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,843
This is the place

833
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,339
where your mother and I designed

834
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,876
to evolve mankind.

835
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,426
I have devoted my life

836
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,432
to that goal.

837
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,333
But I became old and ill.

838
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,803
I had to infect myself

839
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,306
in order to survive.

840
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:51,044
But I'm close.

841
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,480
Any day now

842
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:56,416
my work will be complete.

843
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,153
When I was stationed here

844
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:05,354
with the task of evolving mankind--

845
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,690
That's enough!

846
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,667
No!

847
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,741
( pounding )

848
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,179
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

849
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,615
( distant sirens wailing )

850
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,925
Go through sections 1, 3 and 6.

851
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,986
See if there are any survivors
and bring them here.

852
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,488
Sections 4, 8 and 11
have all been overrun.

853
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,865
Larkin, my father lives in 11.

854
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:48,369
- Jamie over walkie-talkie: Hello?
- No.

855
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,429
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

856
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,497
Jamie, is that you?

857
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,940
Thank God.

858
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,342
I'm trapped in a laboratory
with Mason Lane.

859
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,812
Whoever you are,
I need your help.

860
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,405
Jamie, listen,
I know where you are.

861
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,713
Get out and find someplace to hide.
I'm on my way.

862
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,345
You take care of them.
I'll deal with this.

863
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,407
( man screaming )

864
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,438
( crash )

865
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:09,849
( panting )

866
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:21,157
Man: Somebody help me!

867
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,032
( crash )

868
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,871
Man: Help!

869
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,387
( footsteps )

870
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,743
( keys jingle )

871
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,770
( lock rattles )

872
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,784
( light switch clicks )

873
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,992
It's over, Jamie.

874
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:34,301
Come out.

875
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:37,328
It's over.

876
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,703
Mason.

877
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:43,302
Ah, coming to touch
greatness again?

878
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:47,076
No, I came to see the man
who spoke of greatness

879
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:50,676
but never understood
what that meant.

880
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,018
Let's put an end to this.
I came unarmed.

881
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,786
That was a mistake.

882
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,818
Stop.

883
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,353
( moans )

884
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,398
- It's over.
- Yes.

885
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,432
No.

886
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,106
( screaming )

887
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:35,123
( coughing, grunting )

888
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,307
God damn it all,
it shouldn't have come to this.

889
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,785
We're in the business of helping
mankind, not killing innocent people.

890
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,448
And you shouldn't even be here.
God damn Macavire

891
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,924
Iuring you out here with some
made-up inheritance story.

892
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,790
Wait, why would he do that?

893
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,295
Because he wanted the antidote
to stop the outbreak

894
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,991
- and he thought you had it.
- What about you

895
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,829
trying to get rid of me
for 75 grand?

896
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,529
I was trying to save you,
to get you away from all this.

897
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,629
Save me?
You and Mason killed my mother.

898
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,607
No, sweetheart,
I came back for you.

899
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:22,041
It was me that got you
off the island.

900
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,739
Your mother died trying to stop
that lunatic.

901
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,010
She knew that the antidote
was the only thing

902
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,142
that could stop his master plan.

903
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:32,881
If you do have the antidote, this island
is the last place you should be.

904
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,149
Your mother--

905
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,781
( tires screech )

906
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,917
- ( car honking continuously )
- ( baby crying )

907
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,020
Is that Sarah's car?

908
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,621
( baby crying )

909
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:45,326
Okay.

910
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:50,198
Larkin: You got it?

911
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,100
Jamie: Yeah. Shh.

912
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:57,803
( honking stops )

913
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,643
Shh.

914
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:05,843
Let's get you out of here.

915
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,616
It's okay. Shh.

916
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,115
( screams )

917
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:16,528
( gagging )

918
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,078
( baby crying )

919
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:06,111
There should be a gas can
in here somewhere.

920
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,449
What is this place?

921
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:18,550
We preserve the pearls with salt
and ship them around the world.

922
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,654
Come on.

923
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,329
That's what all these people
are doing on the island.

924
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,239
We've got a ready-built--

925
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,903
Here, fill the engine.
I'll be right back.

926
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:37,434
Just go do it now. Go.

927
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,917
You don't have to do this.

928
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,955
( screeching )

929
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,612
Wait. Please.

930
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,984
( screams )

931
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:55,388
If you're looking at the left hand,
you don't see me.

932
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:32,183
Wait. Wait.

933
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:37,121
Wait.

934
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,866
Please.

935
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:43,063
Jamie, don't go.

936
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:46,096
Please don't leave me here.

937
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,133
Come back.

938
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,702
I don't want this.

939
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:53,577
Jamie.

940
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,073
Jamie!

941
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:54,837
( sneezes )

942
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,186
( exclaims )

943
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,767
( boat horn toots )

944
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,522
This will keep you safe.

945
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:31,429
( baby fussing )

946
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:53,525
Man over radio: Boat 0110,
abandoned boat off starboard bow.

947
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:56,826
It appears to have one infant passenger
onboard, no adults. Over.

948
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,266
Female dispatcher: 3249,
confirm sole infant onboard. Over.

949
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:02,826
Man: 0110, visual confirmation
of an infant onboard.

950
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,964
Request permission
to pursue rescue. Over.

951
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:42,832
( woman continues shouting )

952
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,930
( ominous music playing )

953
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,894
( waves crashing )
