THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.

BE IN JAMAICA BY NOW,

GO UP IN THIS WEATHER.

1064
01:02:58,657 --> 01:03:00,057
HA HA!

1065
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:04,245
AMAZING, DAD.

1066
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,547
DAD! TWO O'CLOCK! LOOK!

1067
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:12,069
ARE THEY GONNA
GO BOMB THE GLACIER?

1068
01:03:12,137 --> 01:03:15,089
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1069
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:19,544
Pilot: EVERYTHING PROCEEDING
PROPERLY, APPROACHING GLACIER.

1070
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:27,501
ROGER THAT. WE'RE AT
THE OBSERVATION LOCATION.

1071
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:31,239
WE'RE AT AN ALTITUDE
OF 3-500 FEET

1072
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:35,310
AND SIX MILES
FROM LOCATION IMPACT.

1073
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:38,429
WE NEED THE COORDINATES
TO PLANT THE EXPLOSIONS.

1074
01:03:38,496 --> 01:03:40,981
ROGER THAT.
SENDING THEM NOW.

1075
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,983
TEAMS FIVE AND SIX
HAVE LANDED,

1076
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,887
WAITING FOR SUPPLIES.

1077
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:49,056
ROGER THAT.
WE ARE DESCENDING NOW.

1078
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,449
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,

1079
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:17,801
AN HOUR TILL IMPACT.
AFFIRMATIVE?

1080
01:04:17,869 --> 01:04:20,605
63 MINUTES, MAJOR.

1081
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:22,807
ROGER THAT.

1082
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:27,612
COME ON, COME ON,
GET IT, GO, GO!

1083
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,379
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SINOR,

1084
01:05:01,447 --> 01:05:03,864
HOW LONG
UNTIL THE PAYLOAD DROP?

1085
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:05,216
ARRIVING NOW.

1086
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:06,651
ROGER THAT.

1087
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,429
COME ON. WE HAVE
TO FIND SHELTER.

1088
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,564
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS
I'M IN JERSEY.

1089
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:21,666
WE WILL.

1090
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:25,853
COME ON.

1091
01:05:27,188 --> 01:05:30,274
CAN WE JUST STOP?
I'M TIRED.

1092
01:05:30,342 --> 01:05:31,626
NOT YET.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.

1093
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,778
COME ON.

1094
01:05:33,845 --> 01:05:36,346
HEY! AAH! AAH!

1095
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:37,715
GIVE ME YOUR COAT!

1096
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:39,133
HEY, LET HER GO!

1097
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,784
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!

1098
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:41,885
LET HIM GO!

1099
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:44,688
GIVE ME YOUR COAT
OR I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

1100
01:05:44,756 --> 01:05:46,490
STOP! STOP!

1101
01:05:46,558 --> 01:05:48,175
Man: NATIONAL GUARD!
STOP!

1102
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:49,543
ARE YOU OKAY?

1103
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:50,745
STOP!

1104
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,498
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO
DOING OUT HERE?

1105
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:56,634
THIS CITY'S BEEN EVACUATED!

1106
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,819
TO WHERE?

1107
01:05:57,886 --> 01:05:58,552
TO SHELTERS.

1108
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,370
HELL, YOU GUYS
ARE LUCKY I FOUND YOU.

1109
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,356
I WAS ON MY LAST SWEEP.
LET'S GO!

1110
01:06:02,424 --> 01:06:03,858
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE GLACIER?

1111
01:06:03,925 --> 01:06:06,177
ISN'T IT HEADED
RIGHT FOR US?

1112
01:06:06,244 --> 01:06:07,961
NOT FOR LONG.

1113
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:11,432
THERE'S A COMBINED TASKFORCE
ON ITS WAY TO MEET IT.

1114
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,766
SO YOU'VE DECLARED WAR
ON A GLACIER?

1115
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,452
THAT'S RIGHT.

1116
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,769
IT'S THE LAST CHUNK
OF THE GLACIER,

1117
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:17,488
AND THEY'RE PUTTING
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE ON IT.

1118
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:21,358
NOW GET YOUR ASSES INSIDE
BEFORE I HAVE YOU ARRESTED!

1119
01:06:34,072 --> 01:06:36,474
GO! GO!

1120
01:06:40,261 --> 01:06:43,014
THAT'S THE LAST
OF THE EXPLOSIVES, MAJOR.

1121
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:44,215
GOOD, GOOD!

1122
01:06:44,283 --> 01:06:46,133
ALL EXPLOSIVES
HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED.

1123
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:47,401
ROGER THAT.

1124
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:49,753
THE CHARGES ARE IN PLACE!
TAKE US BACK HOME!

1125
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:52,874
COPY THAT.
PREPARE FOR EXTRACTION.

1126
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:56,577
ROGER THAT.

1127
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:23,120
HEY, NELSON.
GRAB THE COMPUTER.

1128
01:07:23,188 --> 01:07:24,538
I WANT TO FIND OUT

1129
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:28,075
IF WE CAN CONNECT
TO A SATELLITE
AT THIS ALTITUDE.

1130
01:07:28,143 --> 01:07:29,960
GOT IT.
SHOULD TAKE A SEC.

1131
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,380
RECEPTION BLOWS UP HERE.

1132
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:33,464
I GOT A SIGNAL.

1133
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:34,982
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

1134
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,735
OKAY, I WANT YOU
TO CONNECT UP
TO THE NOAA WEBSITE.

1135
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:42,373
I WANT TO FIND OUT
WHERE THAT GLACIER IS
RIGHT NOW.

1136
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,308
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE LOGIN?

1137
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:46,744
LOGIN IS USERNAME JULIA,

1138
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:50,298
PASSWORD, NELSON.

1139
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:52,133
DAD, THAT'S LAME.

1140
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,534
THAT IS SWEET.

1141
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,420
LAME OR NOT, OPEN UP
THE TRACKING PROGRAM.

1142
01:07:56,488 --> 01:07:58,823
NOW RUN THE SIMULATION
WITH THE SAME COORDINATES,

1143
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:02,126
BUT PUT IN OUR GPS
LOCATION RIGHT NOW.

1144
01:08:02,193 --> 01:08:03,561
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

1145
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:06,613
TRYING TO FIND OUT
HOW FAR AWAY WE ARE
FROM THAT GLACIER.

1146
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:11,418
OKAY, IT'S 50 MILES
BEHIND US.

1147
01:08:11,486 --> 01:08:13,838
IT'S MOVING AT
200 MILES AN HOUR.

1148
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:14,822
WHAT?

1149
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:18,025
HOW CAN A GLACIER MOVE
AT 200 MILES PER HOUR?

1150
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,343
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1151
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,996
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
ELSE DOES EITHER.

1152
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:22,913
CAN WE OUTRUN THAT?

1153
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,464
ARE WE GONNA
MAKE IT ON TIME?

1154
01:08:24,532 --> 01:08:27,818
LET'S FIND OUT.

1155
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:34,141
WHAT'S WRONG?

1156
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:37,294
WE'RE ICING UP.

1157
01:08:37,362 --> 01:08:39,764
DOESN'T THIS MODEL
HAVE DE-ICERS?

1158
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:43,467
NO. WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO FLY LOW
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

1159
01:08:43,535 --> 01:08:45,152
WE'RE BURNING FUEL
LIKE CRAZY.

1160
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,654
I NEED YOU GUYS
TO LOOK OUTSIDE

1161
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:49,323
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY KIND OF PRIVATE
AIRFIELD,

1162
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:53,544
A CROP DUSTING
OPERATION, ANYTHING.

1163
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,867
YOU GUYS FINDING
ANYTHING?

1164
01:08:59,934 --> 01:09:02,587
HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE
FROM NEW YORK?

1165
01:09:02,654 --> 01:09:05,673
CAN'T BE MORE
THAN 100 MILES.

1166
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,941
YOU GUYS SEEING
ANYTHING?

1167
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:09,727
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

1168
01:09:09,795 --> 01:09:12,162
THIS VISIBILITY
SUCKS BALLS.

1169
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,497
NELSON!

1170
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:16,017
OKAY, GUYS, HOLD ON.
WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.

1171
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,157
ANYTHING?

1172
01:09:23,224 --> 01:09:25,375
NOPE, NOTHING.

1173
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,065
WE'RE STILL COLLECTING
A LOT OF ICE.

1174
01:09:31,132 --> 01:09:33,768
I MAY HAVE
TO PUT HER DOWN
AT ANY TIME, GUYS.

1175
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:35,736
HOW MUCH MORE ICE
CAN THIS THING TAKE?

1176
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:36,804
NOT A LOT.

1177
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,238
THESE HEADWINDS
ARE KILLING US.

1178
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:40,107
WE COULD WALK THERE
FASTER.

1179
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:41,442
HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT?

1180
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:43,577
ABOUT ANOTHER
10 MINUTES.

1181
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:46,380
I'M GONNA TRY
TO LAND HER AT NEWARK
OR LA GUARDIA.

1182
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,516
WILL THEY ALLOW US TO LAND
WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN?

1183
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,451
WELL, I'LL JUST
RADIO AHEAD

1184
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,585
AND TELL THEM WE'RE
AN EMERGENCY.

1185
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:52,953
THEY HAVE
TO LET US LAND.

1186
01:09:53,021 --> 01:09:55,823
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE
THERE TO HEAR US?

1187
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,458
OH, CRAP!

1188
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,527
Teri: WHAT?

1189
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:02,796
WE JUST RAN OUT OF FUEL
IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK!

1190
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:05,899
OKAY, GUYS,
STRAP YOURSELVES IN.

1191
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:08,536
GET READY. WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO GO FOR
AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

1192
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:09,804
REALLY, BILL?

1193
01:10:09,871 --> 01:10:12,522
YES! GET READY!

1194
01:10:23,635 --> 01:10:26,436
GOD, LOOK AT ALL
OF THESE PEOPLE.

1195
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:55,115
WELL, AT LEAST
WE GET FREE COOKIES.

1196
01:10:55,183 --> 01:10:57,250
YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS
ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND US?

1197
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:58,586
I HOPE SO.

1198
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:00,921
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

1199
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:03,256
DAD'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE
NEAR OSLO.

1200
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:06,294
IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST HIT.

1201
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:08,328
IT'S OKAY.

1202
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:09,797
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.

1203
01:11:30,435 --> 01:11:31,852
OKAY, YOU GUYS.

1204
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,571
WE GOT TO GET
SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING
ANOTHER PLACE TO LAND,

1205
01:11:33,638 --> 01:11:35,139
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE IT TO NEWARK.

1206
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,808
WE'RE ENTERING
INTO THE NEW YORK
AIR CORRIDOR NOW.

1207
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:39,110
I'M GONNA GET
ON THE RADIO

1208
01:11:39,177 --> 01:11:40,677
AND SEE IF ANYBODY'S
THERE LISTENING.

1209
01:11:40,745 --> 01:11:42,546
GIVE ME THE RADIO
THERE, NELSON.

1210
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,470
NEWARK TOWER,
THIS IS CESSNA...

1211
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,205
WHERE'S
THE FLIGHT NUMBER?

1212
01:11:51,272 --> 01:11:52,740
GIVE ME THE FLIGHT
NUMBER.

1213
01:11:56,678 --> 01:12:01,749
THIS IS CESSNA
NUMBER NOVEMBER
NINER, NINER, 7-2-5.

1214
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,517
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.

1215
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,720
DO YOU COPY?

1216
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:07,554
CAN THEY EVEN HEAR US?

1217
01:12:07,622 --> 01:12:09,806
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1218
01:12:09,874 --> 01:12:11,975
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

1219
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:13,994
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND
A HOLE AND SLIP INTO IT.

1220
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:15,329
BUCKLE UP, GUYS.

1221
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,730
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
WE'RE GONNA BE
ON THE GROUND

1222
01:12:16,797 --> 01:12:19,683
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
SO HOLD ON.

1223
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,019
I NEED YOU GUYS
TO LOOK AROUND

1224
01:12:22,086 --> 01:12:24,087
TO SEE IF YOU CAN SEE
ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT

1225
01:12:24,155 --> 01:12:27,324
THAT MIGHT
BE LANDING WITHOUT TOWER
PERMISSION, OKAY?

1226
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:44,592
BRACE YOURSELVES!

1227
01:13:00,508 --> 01:13:02,376
TWO O'CLOCK! LOOK!

1228
01:13:19,477 --> 01:13:21,311
YOU OKAY?

1229
01:13:21,379 --> 01:13:22,980
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1230
01:13:23,048 --> 01:13:24,131
YOU OKAY?

1231
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:25,265
YEAH.
YEAH.

1232
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,901
YEAH? OKAY.

1233
01:13:33,508 --> 01:13:36,092
WE'RE DOWN.
OKAY, OKAY.

1234
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,361
LET'S GET OUT, GUYS.
COME ON.

1235
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,188
COME ON OUT.

1236
01:13:54,612 --> 01:13:56,947
COME ON, GUYS.
HERE WE GO.

1237
01:14:23,308 --> 01:14:24,975
YOU OKAY?

1238
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:26,577
YEAH.

1239
01:14:26,645 --> 01:14:30,313
WELL, I GUESS WE
GOT OUT JUST IN TIME.

1240
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:34,501
HEY, GUYS, LOOK.

1241
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:37,203
IT'S NEW YORK.
WE DID IT!

1242
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:39,273
ALMOST THERE.

1243
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,742
YEAH. [LAUGHS]

1244
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,546
DID YOU CRASH
THAT ONE EIGHTY?

1245
01:14:45,613 --> 01:14:48,348
YEAH. I'M REALLY SORRY.

1246
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,351
I GOT ALL THE INSURANCE
INFORMATION IF YOU NEED IT.

1247
01:14:51,419 --> 01:14:53,704
IF A CRASHED CESSNA
WAS ALL WE HAD
TO WORRY ABOUT,

1248
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:56,172
I'D CALL IT A GOOD DAY.

1249
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,057
COME WITH ME.

1250
01:14:57,124 --> 01:14:59,325
LET'S GET YOU
INTO SOMEPLACE SAFE.

1251
01:15:06,901 --> 01:15:08,168
COLONEL SINOR,
THIS IS COMMAND.

1252
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:10,620
WE ARE LESS THAN
30 SECONDS FROM DETONATION.

1253
01:15:10,688 --> 01:15:12,523
ROGER THAT.

1254
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,525
WE ARE ALL CLEAR
AND STANDING BY.

1255
01:15:14,592 --> 01:15:16,993
GIVE ME A LONG COUNT,
CAPTAIN.

1256
01:15:29,523 --> 01:15:31,057
FIRE!

1257
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:51,011
[LAUGHS]

1258
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:23,460
WE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

1259
01:16:40,144 --> 01:16:41,945
WERE YOU GUYS HEADED
INTO MANHATTAN?

1260
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:44,281
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING
TO GET OUR DAUGHTER.

1261
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,566
I'M SORRY.

1262
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:48,201
NO ONE'S GETTING IN
AND OUT OF NEW YORK ALIVE.

1263
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:51,070
JUST STAY HERE.
THE NATIONAL GUARD'S
GONNA BE HERE TO GET YOU.

1264
01:16:51,138 --> 01:16:53,523
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

1265
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:54,657
I'LL BE RIGHT--

1266
01:16:54,725 --> 01:16:56,576
OH!
OH!

1267
01:16:56,644 --> 01:16:59,196
COME ON, GET BACK!
GET BACK!

1268
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:02,115
WE JUST GOT TO STAY AWAY
FROM TALL BUILDINGS

1269
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:03,984
WITH LOTS OF GLASS,
GOT IT?

1270
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,820
DAD, WE'RE GOING
TO MANHATTAN.

1271
01:17:07,955 --> 01:17:09,556
POINT TAKEN.

1272
01:17:09,623 --> 01:17:12,125
SO HOW WE GONNA
GET THERE?

1273
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:13,626
WE GOT TO GET OURSELVES
ANOTHER CAR

1274
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:15,962
AND THEN JUST DRIVE
INTO THE CITY.

1275
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:18,298
AND GO WHERE?
TO THE DORM.

1276
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:21,168
THE DORM? SHE'S NOT AT
THE DORM AND YOU KNOW THAT.

1277
01:17:21,235 --> 01:17:23,536
WE CAN ONLY HOPE
SHE GOT OUR MESSAGE.

1278
01:17:23,604 --> 01:17:25,072
WHAT, TO GO TO FLORIDA?

1279
01:17:25,139 --> 01:17:27,107
LOOK, SHE MAY NOT
BE IN NEW YORK,

1280
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,809
BUT WE HAVE START THERE.

1281
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:30,177
FROM THERE, MAYBE
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND

1282
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:31,311
SOME SORT OF CLUE
WHERE SHE--

1283
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:33,780
ARE YOU WILLING
TO SACRIFICE?

1284
01:17:33,848 --> 01:17:35,182
HEY, GUYS!

1285
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,834
ARE WE GOING OR WHAT?

1286
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:40,520
WERE THE KEYS
IN THE IGNITION?

1287
01:17:40,588 --> 01:17:41,855
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

1288
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,024
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.
LET'S JUST GO.

1289
01:17:45,426 --> 01:17:47,227
I'M GONNA TRY AND
GET HOLD OF HER AGAIN.

1290
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,128
IF WE'RE IN JERSEY,
HOW FAR IS NEW YORK?

1291
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:50,630
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH LONGER.

1292
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:52,432
WE'RE COMING UP TO
THE GEORGE WASHINGTON
BRIDGE.

1293
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,434
NO SIGNAL.

1294
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:57,104
IT JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT
ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY NOW.

1295
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,406
IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH.

1296
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:04,244
WE JUST NEED TO GET
UNDER THE GW.

1297
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,247
I'LL TRY TO GET
THE GPS RUNNING.

1298
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,889
IS EVERYONE TRYING
TO GET TO NEW YORK?

1299
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:19,392
LOOK AT THAT MESS.

1300
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,679
NELSON, SEE IF YOU
CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO THE BRIDGE.

1301
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:46,352
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TURN YOUR CAR AROUND.

1302
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,720
YOU CAN'T
GET THROUGH HERE.

1303
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,356
WE HAVE TO GET TO MANHATTAN.

1304
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:51,308
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NO ONE'S GOING
OVER THERE.

1305
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:53,927
NO, OUR DAUGHTER IS THERE,
AND WE NEED TO PICK HER UP.

1306
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,128
I DON'T CARE IF
THE POPE'S OVER THERE.

1307
01:18:55,195 --> 01:18:58,215
NO ONE'S GOING
IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

1308
01:18:58,282 --> 01:19:02,085
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA
MATTER SOON ANYWAY.

1309
01:19:02,153 --> 01:19:03,786
PLEASE JUST LET US GO.

1310
01:19:03,855 --> 01:19:04,838
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.

1311
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:08,192
WASHINGTON BRIDGE,
IT'S OUT.

1312
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:14,231
WOW!

1313
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,602
THE AIR FORCE IS
COMING IN FOR THEIR
LAST AIR STRIKE.

1314
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,953
LET'S HOPE THAT DOES IT,

1315
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:23,240
OR MAYBE NONE OF US
WILL GET OUT OF HERE.

1316
01:19:25,043 --> 01:19:26,642
COME ON, LET'S GO!

1317
01:19:30,264 --> 01:19:31,814
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO NOW, BILL?

1318
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:34,034
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

1319
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,285
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1320
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,204
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
THINKING SOMETHING. WHAT?

1321
01:19:38,272 --> 01:19:41,074
OH, IT'S JUST THAT

1322
01:19:41,142 --> 01:19:43,409
REMEMBER
WHEN THE KIDS WERE
REALLY, REALLY YOUNG

1323
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:45,078
AND WE THOUGHT THAT
IF WE COULD PUT

1324
01:19:45,146 --> 01:19:47,430
SOME SORT OF TRACKING
DEVICE ON THEM,

1325
01:19:47,498 --> 01:19:49,349
WE'D ALWAYS KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE?

1326
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,585
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE
INVENTED THAT DEVICE.

1327
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,654
DAMN IT!

1328
01:19:57,091 --> 01:19:58,875
WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!

1329
01:19:59,077 --> 01:20:00,260
WE DO HAVE
A TRACKING DEVICE!

1330
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,028
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, NELSON?

1331
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:05,098
OH, OF COURSE!
OF COURSE WHAT?

1332
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,000
EVEN IF WE CAN'T TALK
TO HER ON HER PHONE,

1333
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,952
WE CAN TRACK HER PHONE.

1334
01:20:09,019 --> 01:20:10,737
REALLY?
WE CAN DO THAT?

1335
01:20:10,804 --> 01:20:11,888
YES.
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?

1336
01:20:11,739 --> 01:20:12,889
DON'T ASK.

1337
01:20:12,957 --> 01:20:14,541
I GOT IT!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!

1338
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,826
NEW JERSEY?

1339
01:20:15,893 --> 01:20:17,877
SHE'S HERE!
SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY!

1340
01:20:17,945 --> 01:20:19,012
OH, MY GOD, BILL.

1341
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,397
WHERE?

1342
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:22,415
UM...FOUR MILES THAT WAY.

1343
01:20:28,789 --> 01:20:30,440
TWO MORE MILES.

1344
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:35,178
HURRY, BILL!

1345
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:46,206
OKAY, PEOPLE, THIS IS IT!

1346
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:06,209
STAY BACK.

1347
01:21:25,296 --> 01:21:27,831
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!

1348
01:21:27,898 --> 01:21:30,099
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!

1349
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:31,835
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!

1350
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:34,504
JUDGMENT IS AT HAND!

1351
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:36,590
REPENT NOW, SINNERS!

1352
01:21:36,657 --> 01:21:37,857
JUDGMENT--

1353
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,977
HOW FAR ARE WE?

1354
01:21:41,044 --> 01:21:42,746
1.7 MILES.

1355
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:44,213
WHICH WAY DO WE GO?

1356
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:45,682
THERE'S GONNA BE A DEAD END
ON YOUR LEFT,

1357
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,468
SO WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT.

1358
01:21:48,535 --> 01:21:50,670
OKAY, GUYS, HERE WE GO.
HOLD ON A SECOND!

1359
01:21:57,478 --> 01:22:00,780
T MINUS 2 MINUTES
FOR LAUNCH.

1360
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:13,226
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE NOT
GETTING THROUGH THIS.

1361
01:22:13,293 --> 01:22:14,494
HOW FAR AWAY IS SHE?

1362
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:16,413
DAD, SHE'S JUST
TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

1363
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,880
OKAY, WE'RE GOING
ON FOOT, GUYS.

1364
01:22:17,948 --> 01:22:20,150
COME ON. LET'S GO.

1365
01:22:24,288 --> 01:22:26,689
WHAT'S THE GPS SAY?

1366
01:22:26,757 --> 01:22:28,625
SHE'S THAT WAY!

1367
01:22:33,197 --> 01:22:35,398
ONE MORE BLOCK THIS WAY!

1368
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,704
JUST OVER A BLOCK!

1369
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:46,659
OH! DAD, MY PHONE!

1370
01:22:46,727 --> 01:22:48,311
GOT TO GET MY PHONE
TO FIND HER!

1371
01:22:48,379 --> 01:22:50,831
NELSON, LISTEN TO ME.
WE'LL FIND HER.

1372
01:22:50,898 --> 01:22:52,332
FORGET IT, FORGET IT!

1373
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:54,050
WE DON'T HAVE TIME!
LET'S GO.

1374
01:22:54,118 --> 01:22:56,052
JULIA!

1375
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,353

JULIA!

1383
01:23:15,222 --> 01:23:19,159
JULIA! JULIA!

LOOK!

1392
01:23:39,964 --> 01:23:41,014
WHAT THE HELL?

1393
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:42,932
THAT'S MY DAD.

1394
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,984
JULIA!

1395
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:46,870
DAD!

1396
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:47,853
DAD!

1397
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:50,190

DADDY!

1399
01:23:51,492 --> 01:23:53,777
I GOT HER! LET'S GO!

1400
01:23:57,548 --> 01:23:59,266
DADDY!

1401
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:02,235
OH, JULIA, ARE YOU OKAY?

1402
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:03,369
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1403
01:24:03,437 --> 01:24:04,504
I'M FINE.

1404
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,140
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, MY GOD.

1405
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,875
OH, THANK GOD.

1406
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,710
OH, BABY.

1407
01:24:10,778 --> 01:24:11,845
HI, BABY.

1408
01:24:11,912 --> 01:24:13,813
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

1409
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,681
WE GOT HER.

1410
01:24:18,318 --> 01:24:20,386
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1411
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:22,339
LET ME SEE YOU.

1412
01:24:22,406 --> 01:24:23,473
YOU OKAY?

1413
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:26,660
YEAH. DAD,
THIS IS LOGAN.

1414
01:24:28,512 --> 01:24:30,180
HI, LOGAN.

1415
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:32,165
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

1416
01:24:32,232 --> 01:24:35,518
LET'S GET TO SAFETY,
GUYS. COME ON.

1417
01:24:51,101 --> 01:24:53,970
Nelson: DAD, DRIVE!

1418
01:24:54,038 --> 01:24:56,389
DAD, GET US OUT OF HERE!

1419
01:24:56,457 --> 01:24:59,208
THE BRIDGES ARE DOWN,
STREETS ARE BLOCKED,
THE RIVER'S FROZEN.

1420
01:24:59,276 --> 01:25:00,744
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

1421
01:25:00,811 --> 01:25:02,879
DADDY?

1422
01:25:06,183 --> 01:25:08,401
Logan: ARE YOU DRIVING
ON THE HUDSON RIVER?

1423
01:25:08,469 --> 01:25:09,585
IS IT GONNA HOLD?

1424
01:25:09,653 --> 01:25:11,021
Nelson:
IT DIDN'T LAST TIME.

1425
01:25:11,088 --> 01:25:12,688
Julia: LAST TIME? WHAT?

1426
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:20,680
Nelson: YOU SEE THAT?
THOSE ARE F-16s GOING IN!

1427
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:36,229
Teri: WHAT WAS THAT?

1428
01:25:36,296 --> 01:25:38,447
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
BIG JUST BLEW UP.

1429
01:25:39,817 --> 01:25:43,619
Teri: WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO OUTRUN IT!

1430
01:26:04,975 --> 01:26:07,827
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE CANNOT KEEP
GOING ON LIKE THIS!

1431
01:26:07,895 --> 01:26:10,413
I KNOW!
I'M TRYING TO FIND
A WAY OFF THE RIVER!

1432
01:26:14,835 --> 01:26:16,852
ANY IDEAS?

1433
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,839
HOW ABOUT THAT?

1434
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,661
OKAY, IF WE CAN MAKE IT.

1435
01:26:32,903 --> 01:26:34,888
GLACIER APPEARS
TO BE BREAKING UP.

1436
01:26:41,378 --> 01:26:42,979
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT!

1437
01:26:43,046 --> 01:26:44,647
LET'S GO!

1438
01:26:53,323 --> 01:26:56,125
OKAY, GO ON THROUGH!
COME ON THROUGH!

1439
01:26:57,862 --> 01:26:59,529
LET'S GO! NO, NO, NO,
FORGET IT. FORGET IT.

1440
01:26:59,596 --> 01:27:01,464
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS!

1441
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:15,494
KEEP GOING!

1442
01:27:15,562 --> 01:27:17,997
HURRY!

1443
01:27:20,834 --> 01:27:23,703
OKAY, GET DOWN.
GET DOWN.

1444
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,010
HONEY.

1445
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:56,586
HEAR ANYTHING?

1446
01:27:56,653 --> 01:27:58,755
NO. IS IT DONE?

1447
01:28:00,124 --> 01:28:03,226
HOLD ON. COME ON.

1448
01:28:03,293 --> 01:28:04,493
COME ON UP.

1449
01:28:04,561 --> 01:28:05,895
YOU OKAY?

1450
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:07,230
YEAH.

1451
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,271
OH.
