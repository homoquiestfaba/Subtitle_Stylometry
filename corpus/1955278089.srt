-No.
-Do you have food?

35
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,352
-I don't know. Maybe.
-Please?

36
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,919
Yoink!

37
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:36,522
-Help yourself.
-I cannot stop eating today.

I polished off a whole row of
Double Stuf this morning.

00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,861
It's ridiculous.

40
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,431
-Hey.
-Hey, Evan.

41
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,700
"Hey, Evan."

42
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,503
-I didn't say it like that.
-Yeah, you did, though.

43
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:51,675
Seriously, you better step it
up before you lose your, like,

44
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,444
-new girl glow.
-Really? How?

45
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:54,979
Well, like, show
some boob, like...

46
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:56,647
-I don't have any boobs.
-You don't.

47
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:59,083
Maybe's, like, an ass guy.
It's not that big of a deal.

48
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:01,754
We're gonna be late, come on.

49
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:04,558
God.

50
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,462
God...

51
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:12,134
Now, you supposed to be
Little Miss Biology.

52
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,868
Don't tell me you afraid
of a dead frog.

53
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,237
Get him, girl.

54
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,106
God.

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,308
It looks like it's throwing up

56
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,744
-from its neck.
-Come on.

57
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:24,148
<i>Em... do it.</i>

58
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,810
I can't do this.

59
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,118
<i>That is nasty.</i>

60
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,556
You know what helps me
when I'm feeling squeamish?

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,958
Gum.

62
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,460
I'll leave it right
there for you.

63
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:38,264
Thanks.

64
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,104
Gum.

65
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,603
Lucifer?

66
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:45,407
You and the devil
on a first-name basis?

67
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,607
Unfortunately, yes.

68
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,118
Hey.

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,886
Em...

70
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:57,589
Thanks for getting me
in trouble again.

71
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:58,957
Calm down.

72
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,658
Em, wait up.

73
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,128
What?

74
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,098
You're the bestest sister
in the world.

75
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,400
If that's the hand that just

76
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:07,633
touched your vag,
I'm gonna kill you.

77
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,634
It was this one.

78
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:09,903
Dude!

79
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,713
All right, I'll see you.

80
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:19,582
-Bye, Emma.
-Hey.

81
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,651
-So you're Stacey's sister.
-Yep.

82
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:22,918
I'm Emma.

83
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:25,722
So... I am CJ.

84
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,657
-I've heard about you.
-That's tight.

85
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:29,595
What happened to your foot?

86
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:30,962
Yeah.

87
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,163
I broke it.

88
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,432
How'd you break it?

89
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:34,900
Shark attack.

90
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,537
It looked a little something
like this.

91
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,046
Come over later?

92
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,680
-Yeah, I'll try.
-All right.

93
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:49,018
Emmalicious, stay vivacious.

94
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,019
Thank you.

95
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,055
Peace out.

96
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,259
Real class act.

97
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,627
Just mixing with the locals.

98
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,595
You should try it sometime.

99
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,410
-Hey! What's his name?
-Evan, why?

100
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,580
-Evan!
-What are you doing?

101
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,182
Be a good neighbor.
Offer him a ride home.

102
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,418
-Don't!
-You want a ride?

103
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,555
-Taking the bus.
-Yeah, 's taking the bus.

104
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,890
It's, like, the last
stop. It's gonna take forever.

105
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:23,293
We insist. Don't we, Em?

106
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,762
Yeah.

107
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,129
Of course.

108
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:29,534
Why are you being such a bitch?

109
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,302
'Cause you don't have balls.

110
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,670
I have balls.

111
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,309
-Hey, Dad.
-You guys ready?

112
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:38,745
-Shotgun.
-Hey.

113
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,012
-Hey.
-No way.

114
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:42,083
Dad, we're giving Evan
a ride home.

115
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,002
-Hey, honey, you're on speakerphone.
-Hi, kids!

116
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,237
-Hi, Mom!
-Hey, Mom.

117
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,239
When are you coming back?

118
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,342
I have a meeting
in Kansas City tomorrow.

119
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,911
-Hopefully, the day after.
-I thought we were gonna

120
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:06,246
finish unpacking this week.

121
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,779
Please, Michael,

122
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,983
let's not get
into this right now.

123
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,517
All right. Fine.

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,986
I love you.

125
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,855
-Gotta go.
-Bye, Mom.

126
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,824
Bye.

127
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,898
You liking it? Here?

128
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,366
Shadow Canyon?

129
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,368
Yeah, I guess. It's different.

130
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:27,169
From Berkeley? Yeah, I'll bet.

131
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:29,439
You know, they say that moving

132
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,243
is supposed to be the third
most stressful life event,

133
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:34,613
after death and divorce, so...

134
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:48,829
Hey, Evan...!

135
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:49,797
-Seriously?
-Girls, stop it.

136
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,333
-She kicked my seat.
-Stop being a jerk.

137
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,669
Well, mind your own business
and maybe I won't have

138
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,170
-to kick you.
-You guys just cut it out, please.

139
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,973
Seriously,
why are you being a jerk?

140
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:57,241
<i>She's being a jerk.</i>

141
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:58,609
<i>Just cut it out, all right?</i>

142
00:06:58,642 --> 00:06:59,811
<i>You are!
Just leave me alone!</i>

143
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:01,111
<i>Stacey...</i>

144
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,299
Hey, Mr. Toomey.

145
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,501
Hey, Stacey.

146
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:21,437
I'm Stacey; she's Emma.

147
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:23,439
Shoot.
It's gonna take me

148
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:25,141
a couple of minutes
to get all that down.

149
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:26,776
Well, it's easy to remember.
I'm the pretty one.

150
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:29,380
Mr. Drakeford,
thanks for the ride.

151
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:31,115
Any time, Ev. Take care, bud.
Bye, Emma.

152
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,216
Bye.

153
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:33,651
Hey, Evan?

154
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:35,554
Tell your dad I put
his pliers in the mailbox.

155
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:38,424
It's not my dad, but okay.

156
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:39,726
Alan?

157
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,563
I can't find my car keys.
Hey, there.

158
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,165
I better go
before she has a breakdown.

159
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,367
Have a good one.

160
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:47,769
-All right. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

161
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,970
Good luck.

162
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,420
Stacey...

163
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,523
what did I tell you
about texting at the table?

164
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,926
Do you see me typing?

165
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,596
I see you looking at your phone.

166
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:13,468
Okay, you want to play
"happy family"?

167
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:17,473
How are things with Mom going?

168
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,614
You're excused.

169
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,785
Thanks.

170
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:34,826
You okay?

171
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,197
No, my mom's been, like,
coughing in my face.

172
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,398
That sucks.

173
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,767
All right, you should have it.

174
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,772
Okay, lady in an elevator.

175
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,306
Watch.

176
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:51,614
This is some chinese shit.

177
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,217
My God. What's doing?

178
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,586
Just coughed blood on her.

179
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,987
Like, I feel like
that's super rude.

180
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,623
Is that real?

181
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,194
Hold on.

182
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:04,862
What are you doing?

183
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:06,531
Emma, did you really
just leave me

184
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:07,934
because I said I feel gross?

185
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,268
Hang on.

186
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:13,639
Emma!

187
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:15,741
-Don't be a jerk friend.
-I gotta go.

188
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:16,544
Emma!

189
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,770
Crap.

190
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,235
Where are you going?

191
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,404
I'll be back in a minute.

192
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,456
Why are you calling me
when I'm three feet away?

193
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:22,990
Your note said to call you.

194
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,559
-Okay.
-Could we make this quick?

195
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:26,228
I'm on a really
limited call plan.

196
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:28,931
Yeah. Sure.

197
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:30,500
Hello? Emma?

198
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,169
She hung up on me.

199
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,873
What have we got here?

200
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,444
Hey...

201
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:39,978
Bill, this is Emma.

202
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,314
She lives right here.

203
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,547
We just... we live right here.

204
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:44,551
It's nice to finally
meet you, Emma.

205
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,219
Likewise.

206
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:48,756
Now I can see why Evan's got
a little spring in his step.

207
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,059
Okay, Bill.
I'll be in in a minute.

208
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,194
Looks like
I'm getting the boot.

209
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:56,733
Hey, now don't go breaking
this little baby's heart, okay?

210
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,269
He is... Look at him,
he is sensitive.

211
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,143
-He is a...
-An asshole.

212
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:07,245
Yeah.

213
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,414
Kind of, yeah.

214
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,427
Good night.

215
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,101
Government officials
do not believe there is a threat

216
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:28,203
to the United States,
in spite of medical exp...

217
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:30,539
Good night, Dad.

218
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,042
Night, sweetie.

219
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,946
Can I ask you something?

220
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,615
Yeah.

221
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:39,184
Is everything okay
with you and Mom?

222
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,590
Things just seem
pretty weird lately.

223
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:52,901
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,770
I get laid off,

225
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,773
I go from teaching PhD
candidates to high school kids,

226
00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:58,940
and, no offense, it's just...

227
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:02,245
I know it hasn't been easy
on you and your sister.

228
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:03,813
Right?

229
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,451
New school, new friends,
new house.

230
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:12,591
Things will be fine,
sweetie, okay?

231
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,630
Yeah, I guess.

232
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:19,300
Come here.

233
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,302
I love you, kiddo.

234
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:24,205
I love you too.

235
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:25,907
Good night, sweetie.

236
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,744
Good night.

237
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,548
That does hurt!

238
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:33,216
Okay, what is it
on a scale?

239
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,418
-What is it on a scale?
-It's just a six.

240
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:41,694
-Nasty.
-Disgusting.

241
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,363
I'm sorry, guys.

242
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,868
The botfly larva is
a multicellular parasite.

243
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,703
It's fairly easily
removed, as you saw.

244
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,271
And you just cover
that breathing hole

245
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,474
with a piece of tape.

246
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,376
Pokes its head up for some air.

247
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:55,678
Pull it out.

248
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,613
Ecuador, 1987.

249
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,549
Pulled that little guy
out of my elbow.

250
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:05,021
Now, I don't know if any of you
are following the news.

251
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,024
If you're not, you should be.

252
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:09,093
There's something going around
that's making people sick.

253
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:12,164
Most are now speculating that
it's parasitic, like this guy.

254
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:14,667
Can anyone tell me
what a parasite is?

255
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,569
Yes, Evan.

256
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,439
It's, an organism

257
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,040
that lives in another organism.

258
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:23,044
<i>Or on another organism,
like head lice.</i>

259
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:24,846
Remember when you had
head lice, Emma?

260
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:27,015
Did just stay that?

261
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,118
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:30,719
-No.
-Anyway, look at this.

263
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,824
Parasites, all right?

264
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,660
These guys cannot survive
on their own, okay?

265
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:37,728
They need a host.

266
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:43,302
Now, sometimes they live
peacefully inside their hosts,

267
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,971
but sometimes... this is
what fascinates me, guys...

268
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,375
Sometimes they take control,

269
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,411
going so far as to manipulate
their behavior.

270
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,147
<i>Toxoplasma gondii.</i>

271
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,484
This is a parasite that gets
inside of a rat's brain

272
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:59,621
and makes the rat completely
fearless around cats.

273
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,824
Why?

274
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:08,567
<i>Because Toxo only reproduces
in a cat's intestines.</i>

275
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,334
So the cat eats the rat,

276
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,170
and the cycle then begins again.

277
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,373
Is it like how zombies
are always biting people

278
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,209
to turn them into more zombies?

279
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:20,881
Know what? It's kind of.

280
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:22,549
I mean, the question being...

281
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,352
When does a host stop
being an animal

282
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,722
and simply become a vehicle

283
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,024
Gracie.
For the parasite?

284
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:30,426
-Are you okay?
-A vehicle, mind you,

285
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,061
with about as much control

286
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:33,562
as an airplane over a pilot.

287
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,432
This is always for the greater good.
-Are you okay?

288
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,868
It's always in
the name of reproduction,

289
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:39,771
of-of proliferation.

290
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:44,743
Now, this parasite that

291
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:45,812
we're dealing with overseas

292
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,047
is most likely single-cell.

293
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:01,163
Gracie!

294
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,181
Hey, have you seen a girl?

295
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,553
Gracie!

296
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,722
Gracie?

297
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,340
Gracie?

298
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:40,177
Gracie?

299
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:53,794
Gracie?

300
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:00,268
Gracie...

301
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,269
Gracie.

302
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:02,505
My God.

303
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:04,773
Help!

304
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:06,777
Help me!

305
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,945
What happened?

306
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:08,980
I don't know.

307
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:10,513
-What's her name?
-Gracie.

308
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:11,482
Gracie, hey.

309
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,321
Gracie?

310
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,294
Gracie?

311
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,328
Get help.

312
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,997
Go get the nurse.

313
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:28,903
You're okay.

314
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,449
Somebody help!

315
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,418
Help!

316
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,891
Over here, straight.

317
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,425
Open your mouth.

318
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,929
Look up. Up.

319
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,499
Great.

320
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,301
And, Emma, do you know

321
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:57,338
if Gracie has been exposed
to any livestock?

322
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,175
I don't think so.

323
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,645
Do you know
if she's come into contact

324
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:05,080
with anyone who's
traveled internationally?

325
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:10,253
Her mom got back from
San Francisco this weekend.

326
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:14,426
Okay, and did Gracie mention
anything about not feeling well?

327
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:19,431
Last night, she said
that her throat hurt.

328
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:24,839
This morning, when I saw her,
she looked pretty sick.

329
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:28,509
Did she describe
any other symptoms?

330
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,314
Yesterday, she said
she was really hungry,

331
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:34,550
but I didn't think there was
anything weird about that.

332
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,352
Okay.

333
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,888
Did any of her discharge
enter your nose or mouth?

334
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:40,391
No.

335
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:42,093
The health department

336
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,096
has just instructed us
to cancel classes for today.

337
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:46,263
Now, this is just
a precaution...

338
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,135
No. No, it was one of
the other girls in the class.

339
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,002
-Where is she?
-Hang on.

340
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,339
She's fine.

341
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,207
Honey, she's fine,
I'm telling you.

342
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,408
Mom, I'm fine.

343
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,078
See? She's fine.

344
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,580
What about you?
What's going on?

345
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,618
Nothing?

346
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,651
There's no cabs?

347
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,322
Stacey.

348
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:07,323
That's sick.
We need one of those.

349
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,729
They're checking all
the cars that are leaving town.

350
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:13,731
All right, guys, look,
Mom's stuck at the airport.

351
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,601
She can't get a taxi.
I'm gonna go pick her up.

352
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:17,469
I want the two of you to go
straight home, you got it?

353
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,872
How are we supposed
to get there?

354
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,401
-Hey.
-Hey, Gracie...

355
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,103
Gotcha, you're
talking to a machine.

356
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:46,972
Leave a message. Bye.

357
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,644
Hey, Gracie,
it-it's me, it's Emma.

358
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:53,246
Look, I'm really
worried about you, okay?

359
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,715
So please just give me
a call back when you get this.

360
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:56,950
Bye.

361
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,885
Hi, Dad.

362
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,956
Girls, I can't
get back into town.

363
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,290
What?

364
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,624
They've closed
all the roads.

365
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,495
Well, where's Mom?
Is she with you?

366
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,497
No, she's not,
she's still at the airport

367
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,599
because they're not letting
people in the area, okay?

368
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,468
What's going on? Where are you?

369
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,004
I'm at the store
on route 26.

370
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,839
A bunch of us are waiting here.

371
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:40,376
Girls, listen to me,
this is important.

372
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,911
The whole county's
under quarantine.

373
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,746
What does that mean?

374
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,883
Means we're fucked.

375
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,216
Stacey.

376
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,585
It means that this thing
is serious enough

377
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,455
they don't want anybody
going in or out of town.

378
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,989
Now, I'm gonna head
back to the airport

379
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:51,991
and try and get your mom, okay?

380
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,525
We'll be back as soon as we can.

381
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,730
-Okay.
-Listen, promise me two things, okay?

382
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:58,533
Yeah. What?

383
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:00,867
No fighting
and no boys over.

384
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,402
Yeah.

385
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:03,671
Say it, promise.

386
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:04,673
Yes, promise.

387
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:05,573
Bye, Dad.

388
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:08,277
Okay, bye. I love you.

389
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,418
I can't order pizza.

390
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,752
The Web site's on crack.

391
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,521
Boy.

392
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,325
We could have
Great Grains cereal

393
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,062
mixed with meat-flavored
pasta sauce.

394
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:53,432
See, this is what happens
when Mom leaves us.

395
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:58,239
Mayonnaise could be useful.

396
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,340
Brownies?

397
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:02,210
For dinner?

398
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:05,246
Despite,
obviously, the extraordinary

399
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,715
pain and hardship,
of the families

400
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:08,785
and-and persons
who've been affected,

401
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:10,252
and despite the fact
that we have

402
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:11,755
to take this very seriously,

403
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,290
it is important
to remind ourselves

404
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:15,525
this is not an airborne disease.

405
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,897
This is one
that can be controlled

406
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,433
and contained very effectively,

407
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,268
if we use the right protocols.

408
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,938
What are you doing?
I was watching that.

409
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,605
It was boring and depressing.

410
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:44,728
Stacey, did you hear that?

411
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,998
Sta...?

412
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,387
Hello?

413
00:23:12,928 --> 00:23:15,365
Hello?

414
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:33,855
-Stacey!
-What?

415
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:35,789
-Someone's standing at the front door.
-Who?

416
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:37,592
I don't know!
Come on.

417
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,630
I'm telling you,
I saw someone out there.

418
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:47,705
Don't just open the door...

419
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:48,972
Stacey!

420
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:57,684
See? Nobody there.

421
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:07,395
My God!

422
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:08,964
I think you both just
shit your pants.

423
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,633
How did you even sneak
in here with crutches?

424
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:14,538
'Cause I'm a ninja
with the hide-a-key.

425
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,639
You know, there is a curfew.

426
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:19,176
I don't even know what
a curfew is.

427
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,313
-Stacey, Dad said that...
-Says a lot of things.

428
00:24:21,346 --> 00:24:22,513
Hi.

429
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:24,116
Okay.

430
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,617
That her...?

431
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,818
You want to get some of this,

432
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,321
you got to beat me upstairs.

433
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:31,391
That's so sad that
you can't walk like a human.

434
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,281
This whole worm flu thing

435
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,116
is worse than the president

436
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,485
and CDC are willing to admit.

437
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,288
Since when does the flu make you

438
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,788
want to attack people?

439
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:58,658
That doesn't sound
like the flu to me.

440
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:06,033
And plus, you can't
just quarantine

441
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:09,272
half the state of California
and not declare martial law.

442
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:10,839
That's unconstitutional.

443
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:13,441
Hey, Obama,
you can quarantine my...

444
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,812
What is all this?

445
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,785
Hey, Bill, what's going on?

446
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,169
Stacey!

447
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:18,755
Boring.

448
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:20,623
Band-Aid. Boring.

449
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:23,461
What's this?

450
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:24,996
That's a flare.
Be careful.

451
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:26,397
Okay.

452
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,768
My God.

453
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,802
If you come
in contact with someone

454
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:34,074
"who exhibits symptoms,
please notify the CDC

455
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:36,977
"or your local authorities
via the Web site listed below,

456
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,613
or contact the CDC hotline."

457
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:44,721
Are we supposed to wear these?

458
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,456
I think so.
Why are you doing The Robot?

459
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:47,790
Did you just kill yourself?

460
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,526
I am so Asian right now.

461
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,895
That's not racist at all.

462
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:53,231
You're so serious.
Lighten up.

463
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,266
It is serious, Stacey.
Look at this stuff.

464
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,403
-Look at this?
-It's a flashlight.

465
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:58,738
Yeah, but it winds up.

466
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,909
Hey, Mom.

467
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:04,377
Is that your mom?

468
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:05,979
No, no, no, we're okay.

469
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:07,414
-Tell her I say hi.
-Yeah, it's just us.

470
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:09,451
-Where is she?
-Where are you?

471
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:11,853
She's still at the airport.

472
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:15,091
We're fine.

473
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,297
-O-M-G.
-What?

474
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:23,167
Beef taco filling
in a box in a bag.

475
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:25,738
What's your IQ?

476
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,406
<i>...are saying,</i>

477
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,873
<i>"Don't worry, trust the CDC."</i>

478
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:30,709
<i>But, I mean,
patients are going missing.</i>

479
00:27:30,743 --> 00:27:32,345
<i>This is crazy! I...</i>

480
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:36,082
<i>Infected people, under hospital
care, were are just gone...</i>

481
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,556
This is delicious.

482
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,958
Good.

483
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,061
Try not to eat it all, okay?

484
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:48,096
It's all we've got.

485
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,503
This is very, very alarming...

486
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,607
Is that my phone?

487
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,743
You left it upstairs.

488
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,480
Why do you look so nice?

489
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,981
There's a party

490
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,850
-in Phase Two tonight.
-You do look nice.

491
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,986
-Thank you.
-We can't leave the house.

492
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,522
We're alone, Emma,
we can do whatever we want.

493
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,356
It's not cool, Stacey.
There's still a curfew.

494
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:11,091
What's not cool
is doing your homework

495
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,828
in dirty sweats when there's
no school tomorrow.

496
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,331
This is true.

497
00:28:15,363 --> 00:28:18,267
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

498
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:20,404
Well, have fun.

499
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:21,706
Thanks. You, too.

500
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:23,874
I will.

501
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:32,152
What?

502
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:36,423
My God, what a bitch.

503
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:52,209
Balls.

504
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:23,180
I'll see you around.

505
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,519
Hey!

506
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:29,921
Hi.

507
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:32,357
Are you wearing makeup?

508
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,095
Yeah, like,
a little bit, it's...

509
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,065
It was Stacey's, I...

510
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:42,003
Do I look like a hooker?

511
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:45,740
Yeah, but, like,
a really high-class hooker.

512
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:46,774
Okay.

513
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:49,445
Want to dance?

514
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:50,546
Cool.

515
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:00,926
You're a bad dancer!

516
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,612
Wha-what's in it?

517
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:18,813
Tequila.

518
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:19,883
And what else?

519
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,350
More tequila.

520
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,023
-Hey.
-Okay.

521
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,661
Where's CJ?

522
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,529
I don't know.

523
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,300
Asshole.

524
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,434
See ya!

525
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:12,379
I'm glad
one of us came prepared.

526
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:15,183
Shall we?

527
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:17,419
After you.

528
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,001
-I'm sorry, sorry!
-My God!

529
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:36,643
What a slut.

530
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,611
<i>...different room?</i>

531
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:42,483
-Anyone in here?
-Put your penis away.

532
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:44,019
-Okay.
-Okay.

533
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,994
Too bright.

534
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:53,662
Not pretty.

535
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,099
Better?

536
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:59,003
Yeah.

537
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:07,079
Cool.

538
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:16,158
Okeydokey.

539
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:27,105
What are we doing?

540
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:29,406
We're having a moment.

541
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:31,976
Why are you whispering?

542
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,378
I don't know. Why are you?

543
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:44,624
I like you.

544
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:53,435
What the hell is that?

545
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:55,605
-Stacey, wait!
-That ho bag!

546
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,374
-I thought that was you...
-Stay the hell away from me

547
00:32:57,406 --> 00:32:59,677
or I take that sweatshirt
and shove it so far up your ass.

548
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,313
-Stacey, Stacey.
-You don't even...

549
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,008
What the hell was that?

550
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:02,814
-Hey, hey!
-What was what?

551
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:04,584
-What happened to your bra?
-They're not worth it.

552
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,917
-They're not worth it.
-Delicious...

553
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,252
-Get off of me!
-All right.

554
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:10,257
-Piece of shit.
-Baby... B-Baby!

555
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,262
Stacey, wait, Stacey.

556
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,698
-I need a drink.
-Stacey, this is so lame.

557
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:18,767
I really don't think
you should care.

558
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,735
Emma?

559
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:27,678
Emma?

560
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:32,116
My God!

561
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:41,729
Hey!

562
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:44,031
Yo, I'm talking to you!

563
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:49,172
Dude, hello.

564
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:55,012
Let her go!

565
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:58,081
I'm talking to you!

566
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:00,551
Answer me!

567
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:06,892
I know's a piece of shit,
but for two seconds,

568
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:08,961
I thought she was
actually my...

569
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,566
's infected!

570
00:34:12,598 --> 00:34:13,801
Stacey!

571
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,303
Not in here. Come on.

572
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:21,076
-Get out of here! Come on!
-What's going on?

573
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,081
Stacey, what's wrong with him?

574
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:32,390
Okay.

575
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:45,806
My God.

576
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,685
Shit.

577
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:37,342
Is gone?

578
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:44,017
Stacey!

579
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:04,007
Stacey?

580
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,210
Did it get in your eyes?

581
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:06,210
Are you okay?

582
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:07,512
Okay.

583
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:09,282
Come on.

584
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:30,339
Hey, Stace, you okay?

585
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,511
Yeah.

586
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:37,782
I'll be out in a minute.

587
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:42,055
<i>Why isn't
anyone talking about the fact</i>

588
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:43,756
that all these infected attacks

589
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:46,526
started happening at the exact
same time, all over the world?

590
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,196
It's like the infected
are communicating

591
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:49,297
on some secret network

592
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,499
that only they can hear.

593
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:51,566
Now there are reports

594
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,401
of these gatherings of infected,

595
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:55,170
and these nests
across the country.

596
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,940
What I'd like to know is
what the hell are they up to

597
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,976
and why isn't the government
doing anything...

598
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:03,153
You had any contact

599
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:05,123
with an infected person?

600
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:09,127
No.

601
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,936
<i>Banished are
the sounds of children playing,</i>

602
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:47,073

00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:51,913

606
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:56,485
<i>and those which still
need to be inspected.</i>

607
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:57,991
<i>Streets so quiet...</i>

608
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,922
I keep getting his voicemail.
Mom's, too.

00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:01,890
<i>...the uninfected
cowering at home.</i>

610
00:40:01,924 --> 00:40:05,095
<i>An innocuous letter... an

611
00:40:05,128 --> 00:40:06,563
<i>-to the fate

612
00:40:06,597 --> 00:40:07,833

00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,101
<i>The number on the left</i>

614
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:11,269
<i>indicates the number

615
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,505
<i>The number on the right
indicates the members</i>

616
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:15,475
<i>of the household
who have been removed.</i>

617
00:40:15,507 --> 00:40:16,709
It's him.

618
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:18,112
Hey, Dad.

619
00:40:18,145 --> 00:40:20,447
<i>Girls, listen to me
very carefully.</i>

620
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:23,450
<i>Lock every window
and every door in that house.</i>

621
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:25,453
<i>Nobody in, nobody out.</i>

622
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:26,588
<i>Do you understand?</i>

623
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:27,623
<i>Stacey?</i>

624
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:28,824
I'm here.

625
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:30,860
<i>Do you remember where my gun is?</i>

626
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:33,929
-Yeah.
-I want you to find it

627
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:35,599
<i>and keep it on you at all times.</i>

628
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,268
<i>Do you understand?
Do you un...</i>

629
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,839
Dad?

630
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,206
There's no reception.

631
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,476
Try him again.

632
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,181
Dad, are you there?

633
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:51,684

-Dad?

638
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:02,900
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

639
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,405
The land line's out, too.

640
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:09,774
Power still works.

641
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,844
There's no Wi-Fi.

642
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,751
This is not a test.

643
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:19,285
<i>This emergency alert</i>

644

I know it's somewhere in here.

651
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:54,162
Can you please help me look?

652
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,166
What? It's a ring.

653
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:59,300
It's Mom's wedding ring...

654
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:01,137
that she never takes off.

655
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,407
She probably showered
and forgot to put it back on.

656
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,244
Will you please tell me
what's going on?

657
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:09,146
-Nothing is going on.
-Stacey, Mom and Dad...

658
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:11,350
There's nothing to talk about,
so let's drop it.

659
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:15,055
Fine.

660
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,244
Where did you learn
how to do that?

661
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:37,549
Dad used to take me
to the range.

662
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,327
Come on, come on.

663
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:34,016

What was that?

666
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,525
I don't know.

667
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,060
Stay back.

668
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:44,496
Stay right there.

669
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,702
-Get back.
-It's Mrs. Toomey.

670
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:51,038
Get down on the ground.

671
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:54,408
Get down on the ground now!
Get down!

672
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:56,344

Hold it! Hold it!

00:43:57,744 --> 00:43:59,347
-That's not a question!
-Don't move!

675
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:00,816
That's not a question!

676

-Turn around.

-Ma'am...

-Get back in the car! Stacey!
-Get back in your vehicle, now.

00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:06,701
-Sir, we're just trying to see our dad.
-Stop, now!

-Ma'am, get back in your vehicle!

00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:11,407
-Please, sir. We're not infected.
-What part of "get back in your vehicle"

688
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,043
-Please.
-do you not understand?

689
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:15,212
-Sir, it's just right there.
-Get back in your vehicle now!

690
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:17,261

-Get back in your vehicle now...

00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:30,099
Shit.

695
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,311

I need to tell you something.

707
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,413
Okay.

708
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,789
What?

709
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:46,698
Dad cheated on Mom.

710
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,668
What?

711
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:51,470
Last semester,

712
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:52,871
when I went to visit him
at work,

713
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:54,073
I walked in on him

714
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:56,910
with one of his grad students.

715
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:59,779
And I freaked out.

716
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:03,851
So I told Mom
and Mom freaked out.

717
00:49:07,122 --> 00:49:09,293
Well, why didn't
anyone tell me?

718
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,829
They didn't think
that you could handle it.

719
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:15,466
And they begged me
not to say anything.

720
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:18,436
That's why we moved out here;
to start over.

721
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:21,072
Looks like that
didn't go so well.

722
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,576
You should've told me sooner.

723
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:26,613
I'm sorry.

724
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:28,516
I didn't know what to do.

725
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,284
And that's why
I've been such a bitch,

726
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:32,254
I've just been so pissed.

727
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:35,957
And you could've handled it.

728
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,161
I can handle it, Stacey.

729
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:44,768
Stacey?

730
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,437
Emma!

731
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,806
Open the door!

732
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:49,807
Emma!

733
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:52,211
-Open the door!
-Emma, don't...

734
00:49:52,244 --> 00:49:54,173
-It's Evan, Stacey!
-You don't know if's infected or not!

735
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:55,646
Emma, don't...

736
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:58,618
What's wrong?

737
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,855
-He's infected.
-Who?

738
00:50:27,254 --> 00:50:29,623
I'm gonna get the masks.

739
00:50:32,293 --> 00:50:34,429
Is gone?

740
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,505
Emma... don't.

741
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:04,166
Get the lights.

742
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:07,603
It doesn't matter;
can't see anything anymore.

743
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:16,012
Don't move.

744
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:20,652
Put your masks on.

745
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:00,466
's right out there.

746
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:46,895
Are you...?

747
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,399
You're okay. You're okay.

748
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:50,134
It didn't get on you,
it didn't get on you.

749
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,002
You're okay.

750
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:57,410
Stacey, my God.

751
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,946
Stacey...

752
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:03,283
Stacey?

753
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:05,954
Stacey...

754
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:08,289
Stacey!

755
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:27,846
Emma!

756
00:54:30,082 --> 00:54:32,118
Emma!

757
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:34,121
This isn't gonna work.

758
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:36,123
What?
No, I won't feed her.

759
00:54:36,156 --> 00:54:38,126
You said it only grew
when ate.

760
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,061
Maybe you can slow it down,
but you can't stop this thing.

761
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:43,900
It takes over your body, and it
turns you into something else.

762
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:45,768
Emma!

763
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:47,271
Emma!

764
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:49,039
Look...

765
00:54:49,072 --> 00:54:50,574
you can go, if you want to.

766
00:54:50,606 --> 00:54:51,575
-It's okay.
-Emma!

767
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,779
I'm not gonna leave her.

768
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,858
How are we gonna make sure they
don't check the house again?

769
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:12,334
What if they thought
we were already gone?

770
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,504
Coordinates. This
is UF-6 entering sector five.

771
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:12,507
North 47-52-0-6 east...

772
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:16,511
Looks like there's no one here.

773
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,848
Emma!

774
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:24,721
Emma!

775
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:26,057
Emma, please!

776
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:27,592
I'm hungry, please!

777
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,594
Yeah, Stace, it's me.

778
00:56:29,628 --> 00:56:32,132
I'm so hungry.

779
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:33,800
So hungry.

780
00:56:33,832 --> 00:56:35,068
I know you are.

781
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,139
I can feel
it inside of me,

782
00:56:39,172 --> 00:56:41,142
behind my eyes,
telling me to do things.

783
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:42,811
You've got to fight it, Stace.

784
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:45,447
You have to leave.

785
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,850
Emma, please leave.

786
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:51,488
Leave.

787
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,057
No.

788
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:59,164
You remember,
when we were little,

789
00:56:59,197 --> 00:57:01,166
and I came home
from school crying

790
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:03,803
because Katie Moore cut off
one of my pigtails?

791
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,405
Remember?

792
00:57:05,437 --> 00:57:06,807
Yeah.

793
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:10,143
And the next day...

794
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,214
you made her eat her boogers
in front of everyone.

795
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:17,219
It seemed like an appropriate
punishment at the time.

796
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:25,930
That-that's what we do.

797
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:27,599
We protect each other.

798
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:30,369
'Cause... 'cause Dad's
gonna come home soon.

799
00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:31,838
Okay?

800
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:33,974
Okay.

801
00:58:34,246 --> 00:58:36,850
Hey. Anything?

802
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:42,690
How are you holding up?

803
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:48,598
Haven't seen anybody around
in a while.

804
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,408
I'm never gonna
see my dad again.

805
00:58:57,442 --> 00:58:59,210
My mom.

806
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:02,314
You don't know that.

807
00:59:02,347 --> 00:59:04,116
Yes, I do.

808
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,620
I have a feeling.

809
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:15,564
You know...

810
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:18,901
I lost my mom
a couple years ago.

811
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:20,871
She had cancer.

812
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:22,773
I watched her
turn into something

813
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:25,276
that I didn't even recognize,
you know?

814
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:28,211
It was like I was the parent
and she was the kid.

815
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:31,617
And Bill... checked out, so...

816
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,020
it was just me there.

817
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:37,757
Every day and every night.
And,

818
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:41,027
sometimes...

819
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,064
I wish I could see her...

820
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:46,668
Remember her...

821
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,439
More for what she was
instead of what she became.

822
00:59:50,471 --> 00:59:52,241
You know?

823
00:59:52,275 --> 00:59:55,878
I'm so sorry.

824
00:59:55,912 --> 00:59:57,482
I can't leave her.

825
00:59:57,515 --> 00:59:59,317
I know.

826
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:02,421
She's the only thing
that I have left now.

827
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:05,725
I can't leave her.
Please don't make me.

828
01:00:05,758 --> 01:00:07,993
-Please.
-I won't.

829
01:00:36,662 --> 01:00:38,732
Hello?

830
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:44,304
Yo!

831
01:01:00,558 --> 01:01:01,960
Stacey?

832
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:07,633
Stacey!

833
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,434
The Army split.

834
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:11,606
A bunch of us
are getting out of town.

835
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:15,544
Stacey!

836
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:26,690
<i>Help.</i>

837
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:28,660
Stacey?

838
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:33,132
The...

839
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,737
What... what happened?

840
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,439
They're infected.
They locked me in here.

841
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:42,709
-Why?
-I don't know.

842
01:01:42,743 --> 01:01:45,145
Please help me.
Please, I need you.

843
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:48,082
Please help me.

844
01:01:48,115 --> 01:01:49,650
I'm gonna get you out of here.

845
01:01:49,684 --> 01:01:51,853
-I'm so scared.
-I'll get you out of here.

846
01:01:51,886 --> 01:01:54,089
Please, please.

847
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:57,160
Please.

848
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:00,966
You really hurt me, CJ.

849
01:02:00,998 --> 01:02:02,232
Baby, I know.

850
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:03,634
I'm sorry. That's why I came.

851
01:02:26,362 --> 01:02:28,499
I'm sorry.

852
01:02:31,703 --> 01:02:34,773
I'm sorry.
It made me do it.

853
01:02:34,806 --> 01:02:38,711
I can't stop it
from changing me. Please.

854
01:02:38,744 --> 01:02:42,516
Please. Please.

855
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:07,780
Your sister's keeping me busy.

856
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:11,283
Emma, this is nuts.

857
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:12,919
It's a multicellular
parasite, Evan.

858
01:03:12,953 --> 01:03:14,755
That means it can be removed.

859
01:03:14,788 --> 01:03:16,956
Em, trust me,
somebody already tried this.

860
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:18,959
It won't work.

861
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:20,895
You're gonna kill her.

862
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:24,933
She's already dead.

863
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:27,771
I'm gonna save her.

864
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:19,034
Thank you.

865
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:27,009
Take my hand.

866
01:04:30,948 --> 01:04:33,618
No, it's gonna
make me hurt you.

867
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:35,186
You wouldn't hurt me, Stacey.

868
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:36,554
Take it.

869
01:05:14,466 --> 01:05:17,103
Em, promise me something.

870
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:18,740
Anything.

871
01:05:20,274 --> 01:05:23,345
If I don't make it,

872
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:27,317
you find Dad.

873
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:31,021
And tell him I'm sorry.

874
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,124
And I love him.

875
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,331
Listen to me.

876
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:42,468
You are gonna see him.

877
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:46,006
And you can tell him yourself.

878
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:49,009
<i>29, sir. Sector 76.</i>

879
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:51,778
<i>I have a setting
for reference one-zero.</i>

880
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:54,682
She's asleep.

881
01:05:54,716 --> 01:05:57,753
How much did you give her?

882
01:08:15,488 --> 01:08:16,623
It can't breathe.

883
01:08:27,035 --> 01:08:28,538
God!

884
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,912
No...

885
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,785
Stacey?

886
01:09:07,817 --> 01:09:09,019
Stacey, it's okay.

887
01:09:09,053 --> 01:09:10,654
Listen to me, it's gone.

888
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,123
Stacey?

889
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:16,762
It's gone.

890
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:18,765
Hey, it's okay.

891
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,537
It's gone, it's gone.

892
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:25,507

01:10:02,913 --> 01:10:06,684
All right. Got some
really gross soup for you.

903
01:10:06,717 --> 01:10:08,519
What is this? MRE shit?

904
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:10,254
It's all we've got. Sorry.

905
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:12,256
-Looks like piss.
-Yeah, well...

906
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:14,858
I'm sure it tastes
like it, too.

907
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:19,096
God,
it looks so much better.

908
01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:22,999
Are you sure it's okay to eat?

909
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:25,436
Yeah. It's gone.

910
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,747
You guys do it yet?

911
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:39,349
-What?
-You and Evan?

912
01:10:41,351 --> 01:10:43,620
We've been
a little preoccupied.

913
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:46,924
No, haven't really had time
to get naked.

914
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:51,462
Thank you.

915
01:10:52,529 --> 01:10:54,397
You're welcome.

916
01:10:54,431 --> 01:10:57,968
I couldn't have done
what you did.

917
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:03,440
You're my big sister.

918
01:11:14,418 --> 01:11:17,021
<i>Two residences in Sector 14</i>

919
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:19,190
<i>showing nest activity.</i>

920
01:11:19,222 --> 01:11:21,292
<i>Request permission to go hot.</i>

921
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,941
Emma, come here!

922
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:49,879
What?

923
01:12:49,913 --> 01:12:52,383
Everything is gone.

924
01:13:02,693 --> 01:13:03,660
Stacey!

925
01:13:03,694 --> 01:13:05,963
Stacey, wait!

926
01:13:06,763 --> 01:13:08,632
-Emma!
-Stacey!

927
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,967
Emma, she's gone!

928
01:13:19,176 --> 01:13:20,410
Stacey?

929
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:24,781
Please don't go in there.

930
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:27,618
I can't leave without her.

931
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:01,217
My God.

932
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:05,088
God...

933
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,426
Emma. Emma.

934
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:36,287
No.

935
01:15:17,261 --> 01:15:19,564
Stacey?

936
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:15,718
Run!

937
01:16:15,752 --> 01:16:17,053
Come on!

938
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:32,068
This way!

939
01:16:32,101 --> 01:16:34,070
Come on!

940
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:37,275
Shit.

941
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:40,677
Come on. In here.

942
01:16:44,914 --> 01:16:46,449
Shoot him!

943
01:16:53,056 --> 01:16:55,626
Stacey?

944
01:16:57,894 --> 01:16:59,195
Stacey.

945
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:02,499
I can hear them,

946
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:05,802
telling me what they want
to do to you.

947
01:17:05,836 --> 01:17:07,870
To everyone.

948
01:17:07,904 --> 01:17:10,975
-I can't make it stop.
-Emma. Emma!

949
01:17:11,007 --> 01:17:11,975
Please make it stop.

950
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:13,444
I can't.

951
01:17:13,476 --> 01:17:14,811
-Emma, please!
-Emma.

952
01:17:14,845 --> 01:17:17,780
-Stacey, I can't!
-Emma, kill me, please!

953
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:18,816
I can't hold them.

954
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:19,984
-Emma, please.
-No!

955
01:17:20,016 --> 01:17:21,684
-Please.
-Emma.

956
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:24,220
Please, I don't want
to hurt you. Please.

957
01:17:24,253 --> 01:17:28,158
-Emma, I need you to help me.
-Stacey...

958
01:17:30,194 --> 01:17:30,979
Emma!

959
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:33,262
Stacey.

960
01:17:34,303 --> 01:17:36,033
Stacey, stop...

961
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:38,868
<i>I can't hold it!</i>

962
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,300
No.

963
01:18:06,663 --> 01:18:07,789
Not Stacey.

964
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:10,167
Emma, let's go!

965
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:11,901
Stand up!

966
01:18:11,935 --> 01:18:14,504
Come on.

967
01:18:16,806 --> 01:18:18,508
Climb out. Climb out!

968
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:20,644
-Emma...
-I can't...

969
01:18:20,677 --> 01:18:23,047
-She's gone. Come on. Let's go.
-I can't!

970
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,314
Get up! This...

971
01:18:25,347 --> 01:18:28,818
Up, up, up, up.

972
01:18:34,891 --> 01:18:37,361
We gotta go.

973
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:50,641
Emma!

974
01:18:50,673 --> 01:18:52,877
Jump! Now! Get down here!

975
01:19:02,218 --> 01:19:03,587
Gotta jump. One...

976
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:06,622
two...

977
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:08,725
three!

978
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:59,269
Where is that?

979
01:20:59,302 --> 01:21:00,871
In Washington State.

980
01:21:00,904 --> 01:21:03,272
Let's do it.

981
01:21:24,026 --> 01:21:26,797
Hey.

982
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:28,164
Thanks.

983
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:30,133
For what?

984
01:21:31,635 --> 01:21:34,003
Just for being here.

985
01:21:35,338 --> 01:21:37,107
Of course.
