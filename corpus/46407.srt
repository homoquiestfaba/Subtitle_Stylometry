1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,080
Under Siege 1992, 25 fps

2
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,200
Pearl Harbor outer marker,
30 minutes.

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,240
Hey, Case!

4
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,400
What's happening?

5
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,560
Where's your whites?
The Prez is coming.

6
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,160
He won't miss me.

7
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,000
What's this? You're in the Navy,
you've got to look good.

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
-Cue Ball!
-Ryback, where's your whites?

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,920
-Poor boy doesn't have a dress uniform.
-I've got the dress, I forgot the pumps.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,040
Tell him not to worry.
Everything here is handled.

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,600
No, no, that's okay.
We'll take care of it.

13
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Well, it's going to be a zoo.

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Chief Ryback.

15
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Send him in.

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Get in your dress uniform.

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,480
You know how I feel about ceremonies.
I thought this time--

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,840
If I had your ribbons,
I'd wear them to bed.

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,000
Get in your whites.
I'll introduce you to the President.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,520
-I appreciate that, but--
-That's not a good idea.

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,880
For once, Commander Krill and I
are in total agreement.

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,480
I have 50 gallons of bouillabaisse
I need to prepare...

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
...by tomorrow.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
My birthday?

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
I could do the cheeseburger routine.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,680
It's not for me, it's the crew.
They really love that stuff.

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,120
Just don't show your face
till after the ceremony.

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,720
You're a sorry-looking sailor.

30
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,560
That I am. Thank you, sir.

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,720
Sir...

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,480
...why do you tolerate that clown?

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,320
I know he's a good cook--

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,920
He's more than a good cook. You have
no idea. Now let him be, XO.

35
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,640
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,160
Fifty years ago today...

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
...the infamous Japanese attack
destroyed the Pacific fleet...

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
...here in Pearl Harbor.

39
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,000
Today, in honor of those who died,
the USS Missouri returns.

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
Built to avenge Pearl Harbor,
she did.

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,160
Days after we dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima...

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,000
...Japan surrendered
on the Missouri's deck...

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
...ending World War ll.

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
The ship fired
the first shots of the Gulf War.

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,960
Her powerful 16-inch guns
destroyed lraqi bunkers.

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Her Tomahawk missiles rocketed deep
into the heart of Baghdad.

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,600
The fastest and most powerful
dreadnought ever to sail the seas....

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,200
Where's your tattoo?

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Where I got it, you don't want to see.

50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,760
Now the ship will be decommissioned.

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,800
President Bush is paying final tribute
to the ship...

52
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,400
...and her great history.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Did you hear the joke about Andre
and Beaudreau hunting on the bayou?

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
"Where're the guns, Druillet?"

55
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,360
That's about right.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,960
In the end...

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,480
...this unity of purpose....

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,200
These ceremonies not only remember war,
they celebrate peace.

59
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,080
The President ordered the removal
of all Tomahawk cruise missiles...

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,720
...from U. S. surface ships.

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Tomorrow the ship embarks for
San Francisco for her final voyage.

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,720
Her weaponry will be removed,
dismantled and never fired again.

63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,040
The vessel will then
take her place in naval history.

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,480
We will gain the inevitable triumph,
so help us God.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,320
Look at the money spent
on this photo opportunity.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
Ready to go, sir.

67
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,400
Very well, let's single up.

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Aye, sir.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,880
Single up all lines.

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,840
Captain, you have clear water to port.

71
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
Very well.

72
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,720
Krill ain't running this ship.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,800
The old man has to okay
all helicopter landings.

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,360
How's the captain going to authorize
a surprise party for himself?

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
We already stowed all the gear.

76
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,760
What's on this helicopter?

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
This little sweetheart.

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,800
-She's in the--
-Yeah, she's in the cake.

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,560
That is Miss July '89. Jordan Tate.

80
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
We'll be ready for her.

81
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,600
Good. Go ahead and keep that.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,960
Lieutenant, we don't have time
to talk about this now.

83
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,040
No time for the security
of nuclear weapons?

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Maybe I'm not being clear.

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,880
Any watches not crucial shall be
secured during the party...

86
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,960
...including the Marine roving patrol.

87
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,400
We're operating
on a skeleton crew.

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,760
This is an order.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,080
The log will show I consider this
unsafe, and obeyed under protest.

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
Fine.

91
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,240
Hey, Cue Ball.

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Cue Ball in the house.

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,160
Show me a move!

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,360
Turn up the tunes! Turn up the tunes!

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,320
Come on, show me some moves.
Come on!

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
Go, Cue Ball!

97
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,560
Go, Cue Ball, go! Go, Cue Ball, go!

98
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,680
That was cute.

99
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,920
Petty Officer Ryback?

100
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Ensign Taylor.

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
Sir.

102
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,920
You don't have to "sir" me.
We're casual in the galley.

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
I'd watch it.
We still have a week together.

104
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,480
So I won't get to see you
go through puberty.

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
What is it?

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,840
I have orders from the XO
on the captain's birthday.

107
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,560
We're having dinner flown in
from Hawaii.

108
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,040
This galley will be cleared by 17:00.

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,560
You are to report to the mess deck
prior to the helo's arrival.

110
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Negative.

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,040
Excuse me?

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,040
Only I cook for the captain.
You don't like that, talk to him.

113
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't believe you get it.

114
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,960
See, this is a surprise party.

115
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,800
No one is going to talk
to the captain about this.

116
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
You know something?

117
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
He don't like surprises.
Neither do l.

118
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,200
Then I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?

119
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,040
"l guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?"

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,440
Krill's going to skin you alive.

121
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,880
Why is it that I'm
starting to shake so bad...

122
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,000
...and there's this deep fear in me...

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,800
...thinking about Mr. Krill and
the horrible things he'll do to me?

124
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
Commander Krill.

125
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
Send him in.

126
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,440
You wanted to see me, Captain?

127
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
Commander Krill...

128
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,160
...how'd you expect to land
a helicopter without my authorization?

129
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,360
-It was a mistake to think--
-It was a mistake to try.

130
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,080
Your actions are
grossly insubordinate.

131
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,840
I want an explanation. Now.

132
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,480
Admiral Bates wants to thank you
for how smoothly things went.

133
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,080
He has a surprise for your birthday.

134
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
He's flying in from Hawaii.

135
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,520
I see. If the admiral wants
a party, I guess we'll have one.

136
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,640
Let's keep it simple.
Off-duty personnel can attend...

137
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,280
...but watches remain.

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,960
Yes, sir.

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,600
Captain...

140
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,240
...since he wants this to be
a surprise...

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,280
...if you could stay here
till we come for you...

142
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,560
I'll be engrossed in a novel.

143
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Very good, sir.

144
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,200
How's that bouillabaisse?
Heads up!

145
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,400
If I'm not mistaken...

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,440
...every one of you has orders
to report to the mess deck...

147
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
...for the party.

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,040
Stand fast.

149
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,240
Everyone else go! Now.

150
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,440
See you at the party.

151
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,800
You know...

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,680
...this does look delicious.

153
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,400
It smells like a lard omelet.

154
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,800
I put up with your shit...

155
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,400
...because the captain likes
your cooking.

156
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,400
But this time he won't be here
to save you.

157
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Really?

158
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,280
Little flavor.

159
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
You like that?

160
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,160
That's striking an officer!

161
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
It is not!

162
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
That's striking an officer!

163
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,320
-Okay! All right!
-Cuff him and throw him in the brig!

164
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,320
In the brig!

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,960
You need the old man's signature.

166
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
Good point.

167
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,600
Secure him in the meat locker.

168
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
Now!

169
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,160
Right now!

170
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,320
Let's go.

171
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,880
Now I know why you're a cook.
You hit like a faggot.

172
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Steel.

173
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,880
Private Nash...

174
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,560
-...you came on board in Hawaii?
-Yes, sir.

175
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,640
Then you don't know about Ryback?

176
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
He is an extreme psychopath.

177
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
He hates officers.

178
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,160
He hates America.

179
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,080
This is the captain's birthday.
I don't want him ruining it.

180
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,960
No one speaks to him
or lets him out.

181
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,360
If he tries to escape,
shoot him right here.

182
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,960
I'm counting on you.

183
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Let's go.

185
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Another cold day in hell.

186
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,600
It speaks well for the Navy
that we can entertain a crew at sea.

187
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,360
It's so human.

188
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,800
And I love that. Don't you?

189
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,320
I just hope I don't throw up.

190
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,440
You'll be fine.

191
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
I love it. I love it!

192
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,840
Welcome to the USS Missouri.

193
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,800
Fantastic!

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,280
We're looking forward
to a great time.

195
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I love this business!

196
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
My future wife.

197
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,640
She's landed.

198
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,600
The Bunny's landed. See you.

199
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
Private!

200
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,880
Doesn't it seem strange
that Krill put me in here?

201
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
I ain't listening to you.

202
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,960
Welcome aboard.

203
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,880
Guys, make a hole.

204
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,880
Don't let them bother you.
They've been at sea too long. You okay?

205
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,280
I still feel really queasy.

206
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,880
We'll go to the wardroom,
where you can change.

207
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,280
Let the lady through!

208
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,000
Be careful with the cake.
Make sure the wires are covered.

209
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
That's the way it goes.

210
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,920
-Are you lost?
-No, no. Where do you want us?

211
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
-Is the band ready?
-Ready.

212
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,720
You're over here.

213
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,800
Starboard side, right now.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You'll knock the captain
off his feet. You're beautiful.

215
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,440
For motion sickness. Take two.

216
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,360
Thanks.
What happened to your face?

217
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Cut myself shaving.
The cake's almost ready.

218
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,680
We have a room for you to change.
You'll be safe from my men.

219
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,240
I'm going to go put on
my party dress.

220
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,080
Don't worry. You can play
this with your eyes shut.

221
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,160
Private!

222
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,960
Let me out!

223
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,360
You follow Krill's orders, you'll
go to the brig! Use your head!

224
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,920
Go get my pies out of the oven!

225
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
I must be nuts.

226
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,280
Very sick.

227
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,920
We want to give you
a great big welcome...

228
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
...to the big,
beautiful Missouri lounge...

229
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,960
...out here in the middle
of the big, beautiful Pacific Ocean.

230
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I'm Bad Billy.

231
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,480
And these are
the fabulous Bail Jumpers!

232
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,680
I have orders not to talk to you.
Understand? Orders.

233
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,840
You could be held accountable...

234
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,360
...keeping me in here like this.

235
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,840
You have to think about that.

236
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,960
Private?

237
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,200
He didn't say
you can't talk to the captain.

238
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,840
Go ask him if he wants me in here.

239
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
You little E-1 prick.

240
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,960
Lieutenant,
this is absolutely beautiful.

241
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Old man says keep her level.

242
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,600
How about an hors d'oeuvre?

243
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,440
What have we here?

244
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,280
All right. There's the Twinkies.
Where's Miss July?

245
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,800
And there she is.

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,360
Miss July, 1989.

247
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,040
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

248
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,080
That's not Miss July.

249
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,840
My God, look at him.

250
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,960
Commander Krill.

251
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,680
Welcome to the revolution.

252
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,000
This party'll make history.
No wonder he wanted everyone here.

253
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,960
Maybe Krill isn't
such an asshole after all.

254
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,280
That's great. Go get the old man.
He's been waiting on you now.

255
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,000
All right.

256
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,160
Miss July!

257
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,680
We're going to surprise the captain now.

258
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,560
-Have a good party!
-Come on, dear.

259
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
Where's the chief?

260
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,440
In the meat locker
until after the party.

261
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,280
It's only like 40 degrees in there.

262
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,440
He'll be fine. He's got a guard.

263
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,840
Krill's a maniac.
Tell the captain...

264
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,400
...he spit in my soup.

265
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
You got a fire in here.

266
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,160
Get my pies out of the oven!

267
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
These pantyhose feel good!

268
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,800
It's okay. I'm here
to escort the captain to the party.

269
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,120
Aye, Commander.

270
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,240
Commander Krill.

271
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,960
Send him in.

272
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm your date tonight, Captain.

273
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,760
Wait.

274
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
Wait a minute!

275
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Who is the highest-
ranking officer here?

276
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,120
Who is the highest-ranking officer
in this room?

277
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,680
Stand up.

278
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,960
Stand up and be recognized.

279
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,680
Part the waves there.
Get out of the man's way.

280
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,600
Put a light on the man.

281
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,280
Now you, sir, are the highest-ranking
officer in this room?

282
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,280
Yes. Operations Officer.
Third in command.

283
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,520
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Commander Green.

284
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,840
Get down!

285
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
What's going on?

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,760
The party's just beginning.

287
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Captain!

288
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,000
Good shot.

289
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,880
Lay down! Hands up!

290
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Heads down!

291
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,160
What are you looking at?
On the floor!

292
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,560
Put your head down.

293
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,640
You want to be good now?

294
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,640
What is this, a joke?

295
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,160
No joke!

296
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,960
I hear gunfire. What's going on?

297
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,960
It's done.

298
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
Four minutes ahead of schedule.

299
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,080
Mother Goose,
the quails are in the nest.

300
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,680
It's just the music.

301
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,680
You got shit for brains.
That's gunfire. Call the bridge.

302
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,160
I don't know who you're talking to.
No one's listening.

303
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,800
I ain't asking you to listen to me.

304
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,360
Call the captain. Listen to him.

305
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,320
Seal it!

306
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,360
Eyes on the man in front of you!

307
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,640
Goddamn it,
that's the last time I'll tell you!

308
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Let this be a learning experience.

309
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,880
If you resist, we will
kill you and the man next to you.

310
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,160
Now move out of here
in an orderly fashion.

311
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Now!

312
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
Turn around. Hands on your head.

313
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Where is it?

314
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Here it is.

315
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,160
Listen to the shit
I've had to put up with.

316
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,600
"Commander Krill has become
increasingly hostile to the crew...

317
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,000
...possibly due to anger over
reviews of his performance.

318
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,120
I recommend psychological
evaluation before his next assignment."

319
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,080
Do I look like I need
a psychological evaluation?

320
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,600
Not at all.

321
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,560
I got to change.

322
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,920
Behind your head.

323
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,560
Up against the wall.

324
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,120
XO on the bridge.

325
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
Listen up.

326
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,480
Hands on your head and move
to the counter, right now.

327
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,280
Your destination is the fo'c's'le.
Cooperate and you won't be harmed.

328
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,400
Change of watch.

329
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,040
You've done a good job,
but you're relieved of duty.

330
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,800
Get your hand off that console.

331
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,160
You're a cheeky bastard. Move out!

332
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,200
My God!

333
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,280
Bunch of wussies.

334
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
The disk, Mr. Pitt.

335
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,600
Guard it with your life.

336
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
Of course.

337
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,400
Bring up the layout, if you will.

338
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,720
-We've overridden their systems.
-We control crypto, CIC...

339
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,520
...engine rooms, boiler rooms,
bridge and all open decks.

340
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,200
We've welded shut the hatches.

341
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,160
A few loose sailors may be berthing...

342
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,280
...or they're caught in nonessential
areas and can go nowhere.

343
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,560
The rest are in the fo'c's'le.

344
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,880
Excellent.

345
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,040
Reactivate the weapons systems,
Mr. Pitt.

346
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,240
Mr. Daumer...

347
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,160
...you may deploy the welding crews
and chop up broadway.

348
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,920
Commander Krill,
you're hereby promoted to captain.

349
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,520
Congratulations. The ship is yours.

350
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,360
The ship is mine.

351
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,960
Thank you, Billy.
All right!

352
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,120
Can we get something to eat in here?

353
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
Get some food!

354
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Krill warned me you were tricky.

355
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,600
I'm not tricky, I'm just freezing.
Something's going on here.

356
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,960
Call the bridge.
No one'll yell at you.

357
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,480
It's just your job.
Check right away.

358
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,160
All right.
All right, I'll check.

359
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,760
That's all.

360
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
Do that. And be careful.

361
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,200
'Tis a rare thing.

362
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,760
This is good. It'll work.

363
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,600
Got a call from Private Nash
on guard duty in the kitchen.

364
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Pitt, pull it up.

365
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,560
That's an unsecured area.
They can access the whole ship.

366
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,560
Ryback. A cook.
A pain-in-the-ass cook.

367
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,080
Give me that.

368
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,200
Private Nash.

369
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm glad you checked in.
I've been with the captain.

370
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,240
Keep Ryback under control,
and don't open the door.

371
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
Tell him you're sending relief.

372
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Tell him you are sending
somebody to relieve him.

373
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,840
Stand your station fast.
I'm sending someone to relieve you.

374
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,960
Is everything okay?
We heard what sounded like gunshots.

375
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Gunshots? Oh, that.

376
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,560
Those are party poppers. Firecrackers.

377
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Part of the party.

378
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,800
Stand firm until you're relieved.

379
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,440
-Yes, sir.
-Over and out.

380
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Anything else you didn't tell us?

381
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,560
Any further memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps?

382
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,840
No other memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps.

383
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,640
There's two men. One's locked up.
I'll take care of it.

384
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,120
We'll handle it. Secure the galley.
Send Cates and Ziggs.

385
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,720
This Marine's armed.

386
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,240
We need more. I'll go.

387
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Don't worry. They're professionals.

388
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,400
They can handle 20 Marines...

389
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,680
...and 100 cooks.

390
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,680
You're wrong, Ryback. You're wrong.

391
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,120
-They were party poppers.
-You got shit for brains.

392
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,760
I know they brainwashed you,
but you have to question authority.

393
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,640
Trust me, boy.

394
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,800
That's gunfire.
Free me and I'll take care of it.

395
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,560
I'll be relieved in a few minutes,
so just shut up and sit tight.

396
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,960
Something's going on.
Use your head this time.

397
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,960
Do what you got to do. Let me out.

398
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,760
Or when I'm out,
I'll shoot you myself.

399
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,240
Commander Krill?

400
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,080
Is that you?

401
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,120
Get your hands on your head.
Turn around.

402
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,120
Get down on your knees.

403
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,760
Cross your ankles.

404
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,920
Where's the cook?

405
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,560
In the reefer.

406
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,400
Which one?

407
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,840
Son of a bitch!

408
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,400
We've got an F-18.

409
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,400
They sent an F-18
to look for the chopper.

410
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Heading 315 miles, speed 430,
approximately 8000.

411
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
207, 61 miles now.

412
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,800
430. 5000 now, into descent.

413
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
We're going down now.

414
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,360
Looks like one helo on deck.

415
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Going in for a closer look.

416
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,960
31 to Missouri, over.

417
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,560
Goodbye!

418
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,560
Are you tracking me?

419
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,760
Negative.

420
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,480
He's locked me up! Mayday.

421
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,840
Welcome to the revolution.

422
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,880
Better call the office.

423
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,160
You're in deep kimchi, buddy.

424
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,880
Better have it all
in one sock for this one.

425
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,280
Claims he was a company man
who worked for you.

426
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,760
What's his name?

427
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,560
William Strannix.

428
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Jesus Christ!

429
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,680
Not good.

430
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,960
Not good.

431
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,600
Mr. Breaker...

432
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,160
...you better be candid
with us here tonight.

433
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,760
We need answers,
and we need them now.

434
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,520
Gentlemen, if any ships or aircraft
approach within 100 miles...

435
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,720
...we will kill the crew and
retaliate using the ship's arsenal.

436
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,600
Bill, this is Tom. What's going on?

437
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,280
I have 32 Tomahawks under my thumb...

438
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,000
...and all you can do
is alert the media.

439
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,120
You don't have the launch codes.

440
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
Let me guess.

441
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
5-6-6-0-4-9-9-7-8-0?

442
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
This is insane.

443
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,480
Be careful with that word, Tom.

444
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,520
This is Admiral Bates speaking.
Tell us why you're doing this.

445
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,680
Hi, Admiral!

446
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Six months ago, Tom Breaker
canceled Operation Cleopatra.

447
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,040
Shortly thereafter, two young men
from Langley tried to cancel me.

448
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,200
Didn't you receive
each man's forefinger in the mail?

449
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,880
Yes.

450
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,040
Did you expect us
to wait for you to try again?

451
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,840
I know things are a little...

452
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,680
-...chaotic for you right now.
-Chaotic!

453
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,520
Wake up!

454
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,960
You and I know that chaos and
bedlam are consuming the entire world.

455
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,440
UV rays are only the beginning.
We have an inch of topsoil left.

456
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,320
Topsoil?

457
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,160
Sexually transmitted diseases,
depletion of the gene pool.

458
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,760
It adds up to oblivion.

459
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,680
Governments will fall.
Anarchies will reign.

460
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,760
It's a brave new world.

461
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
What are you planning to do?

462
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,600
Do you realize that whatever I do
is inevitable? Can we agree on that?

463
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,760
Not necessarily.

464
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
There you go.

465
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,800
You can't argue with me
or negotiate or attempt a ploy.

466
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,600
You have to reconsider your philosophy.

467
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,720
All right, I'm sorry.
Whatever you decide to do is inevitable.

468
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,920
Look at my life.

469
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,240
The life you tried to take.
There was Annapolis, Vietnam, so on.

470
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,600
I missed the 60s,
and I believe if I had been there...

471
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
...to contribute,
everything would've been fine.

472
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,960
Bill, if this is about
reliving the 60s, you can forget it.

473
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,680
The movement is dead.

474
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,320
Hence the name.

475
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,040
It moves a certain distance,
then it stops.

476
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,360
Revolution gets its name by always
coming back around in your face.

477
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,560
You tried to kill me,
you son of a bitch.

478
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,080
So welcome to the revolution.

479
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,960
There's more to follow.
I'll stay in touch.

480
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,240
He's flipped.

481
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,960
He's completely flipped.

482
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,960
I want a list of everything
on that ship.

483
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,040
General, here's what we know.

484
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,960
The threat is verifiable. It is real.
I repeat, it is real.

485
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,800
Shit! You son of a bitch.

486
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,240
Think they believe you?

487
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,600
They believe I'm crazy, paranoid
or something.

488
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,480
I have a harpoon locked on.

489
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Fire when ready.

490
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,520
Pipe down, men!
Pipe down.

491
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,400
Missile away.

492
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,640
Missile away.

493
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,240
Oh, boy.

494
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,400
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

495
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,080
Bang! You're dead.

496
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,360
-He's taken out satellite relay.
-What doesn't he want us to see?

497
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,840
He wants to blind us.

498
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,320
It's illogical. We can
follow his movement from Pearl.

499
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,920
You can vector an AWACS.

500
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,320
Or send E-2C from Nimitz.

501
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,400
Do it.

502
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,280
Wake up the President.

503
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,120
Bring it in.

504
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,360
Keep it coming in.

505
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,800
Cut it fast.
Time is money on this deal.

506
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,200
They better be competent.

507
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,600
Get your ass up there!

508
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
Watch your heads.

509
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Glad I sent you the blueprints.

510
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,240
I have 4 sections this way,
7 sections this way.

511
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,840
I'll have it cut and up
within the hour.

512
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,680
Time is money, on this job!

513
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
Time is money.

514
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,480
This will cut them to the bone.

515
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
Right to the bone.

516
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,240
What's that noise?

517
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,200
That's my beloved crew.

518
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,400
Keep trying. Keep pounding.
Someone will hear us.

519
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,720
Shut the music off.

520
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
What the hell's going on?

521
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,360
What happened to them?

522
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,720
Who are you and why are you here?

523
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
My name is Jordan Tate.

524
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm Miss July '89.

525
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,840
I was hired to jump
out of the cake...

526
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,280
...but I got airsick
on the way here, and so...

527
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,880
...this guy gave me these pills.

528
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,240
-I guess I fell asleep.
-What kind of bullshit is this?!

529
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,000
I am an actress, okay?

530
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,840
I did a Hunter episode
and a Wet'n Wild video.

531
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,320
My agent said I was
going to jump out of the cake.

532
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,840
How many on the chopper?

533
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,800
I don't know.

534
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,280
It was full.
There was a band and caterers.

535
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,360
Where's the crew?

536
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,840
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

537
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,440
You didn't see or hear anything
and don't remember anything?

538
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,360
I've done stupid things in my life...

539
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,160
...but believe me,
I don't know anything.

540
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,960
All right, I believe you.

541
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,080
So who are you? Are you
a special forces guy or something?

542
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,920
I'm just a cook.

543
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,160
A cook?

544
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,640
Just a lowly, lowly cook.

545
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,520
My God, we're going to die.

546
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,400
The ship contains 40,000 rounds
of 20mm CWIZ.

547
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,760
Over 1000 16-inch projectiles.

548
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,560
We believe there's 15 harpoon
cruise missiles still aboard...

549
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,120
...and 32 Tomahawks.

550
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,320
What kind of Tomahawks?

551
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,240
It's all right. It's okay.

552
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,280
Eight of them are specials.

553
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,600
Nuclear-tipped. 220 kilotons each.

554
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,720
Mr. Breaker, would you explain how
this nut could hold a top position...

555
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,600
...in an intelligence agency?

556
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,560
Would you answer that?

557
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,520
High-level covert operatives
like Strannix are under great stress.

558
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,200
They're creative thinkers
who, by their very nature--

559
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,280
Tom trains everyone
in the CIA who's crazy.

560
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,160
All we want to know...

561
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,320
...is how he got our battleship.

562
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,040
That's his specialty.

563
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,160
North Korea was refitting a sub
to fire antiship missiles...

564
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,680
...so we sent Strannix in.

565
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,280
You've been financing
this maniac's private army?

566
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,800
You didn't think
it might be a problem?

567
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,320
Once we realized
we'd lost positive control...

568
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,360
...we tried to neutralize him.
We missed.

569
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,160
Excuse me.

570
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,640
This North Korean sub...

571
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,240
How do you know he sunk it?

572
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,440
Oh, we're positive he sunk it.

573
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,800
Positive.

574
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,880
Roadrunner to Tweety Bird.
Do you read me? Come in.

575
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,880
Tweety Bird to Roadrunner.
We're nearby.

576
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,600
-How's it going?
-Sub's up.

577
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,040
-It's all rock and roll to me.
-Any sign of Wile E. Coyote?

578
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,840
No. Meet at the birdcage.
Roadrunner out.

579
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,680
You're the Roadrunner?

580
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,440
Never been caught.

581
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,280
Problem. Cates and Ziggs are missing.

582
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,440
I radioed them repeatedly.
No response.

583
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,760
-The last location?
-The galley.

584
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I told you to send more men.
I told you.

585
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,480
Please don't leave me here alone.

586
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,000
Believe me, this is the
safest place you can be. Understand?

587
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,360
Let me out of here!

588
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,120
Let me out!

589
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,600
Do you understand what'll happen
if anybody hears you?

590
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,400
They'll try to kill us.

591
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,200
Now be quiet.

592
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,640
I hate being alone.

593
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,200
Do you hate being dead?

594
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,320
Clear!

595
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,480
Put those on.

596
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,360
You're coming with me,
you got to be invisible.

597
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,680
If you're by a hatch and
see the enemy, you become the hatch.

598
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,920
I'm giving you this rifle
with a selector switch on it.

599
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,360
One is fully automatic,
one is semiautomatic.

600
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,000
The definition of semiautomatic is,
when you depress the trigger...

601
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,840
...one round will go off.

602
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,280
That's what I want to give you.
Spend one round at a time.

603
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,160
Turn on the lights.

604
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,120
Check the breaker box.
It's happened before.

605
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,440
Man who did this is a professional.

606
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,640
-Who is he and why is he on my ship?
-Your ship?

607
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,920
You wouldn't be on this battleship
if not for me.

608
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,240
He's a cook, plain and simple.

609
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,920
A cook didn't do this.

610
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,360
He came with the captain.

611
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,400
I know his routine front and back.
He's good with cooking knives.

612
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,400
Cooking knives!

613
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,160
He got lucky.

614
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,080
In my professional opinion,
he is a military reject...

615
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,400
...in command of a galley.

616
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,800
Get down!

617
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,520
-What was that?
-A bomb, jackass.

618
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,120
He used the microwave as a detonator.

619
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,880
Secure everything
between here and the CIC.

620
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,120
You see anything, radio at once
for backup. Understand?

621
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,160
Put these fires out!

622
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,760
I'd like to see the personnel file
on this "simple cook."

623
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,800
Put out these goddamn fires!

624
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,320
SEAL Team 5 will launch from Nimitz
aboard a CH-53 Echo...

625
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,640
...with an Apache gunship in support.

626
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,400
At the objective area, the Apache
will take out the ship's radar...

627
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,800
...and her electronic warfare systems.

628
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,640
Then SEAL Team 5 will board
and retake the ship.

629
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,200
And the odds of success?

630
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,160
If it's a lunatic who only
partly controls the ship...

631
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,680
...the odds are good.

632
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,120
But if he's ready for us...

633
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,600
...if he's prepared to repel boarders...

634
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,720
...the odds are not good.

635
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,480
Bear in mind, the operators
from SEAL Team 5 are the best there are.

636
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,640
This is our only hope of saving
the crew and retaking the ship.

637
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,160
Let me make one thing
absolutely clear:

638
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,040
If the SEAL team fails...

639
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,160
...we will have no alternative
but to launch an air strike...

640
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,160
...and destroy the Missouri.

641
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,760
You know what that means.

642
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,400
We'll get her back for you.

643
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,120
Make it happen. Make it happen.

644
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,480
22... 12... perfect.

645
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,240
It's 44 feet from the weather deck
to the missile canisters.

646
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,960
It'll take a half-hour to assemble
that section of the crane.

647
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,520
Ryback's file was in the captain's
private cabinet.

648
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,920
Ryback is an ex-SEAL.

649
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,800
The goddamn cook's a SEAL?

650
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,920
Shut up and listen.
"Expert in martial arts...

651
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,280
...explosives, weapons, tactics.

652
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,720
Silver Star. Navy Cross.
Purple Heart with cluster.

653
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,920
Security revoked after Panama."
So he could only rate as a yeoman...

654
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,280
...or a cook. How little did I know.

655
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,120
We lost two more men in the engine room.

656
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,880
You were told to review
every crew member's file.

657
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,280
I know, but I didn't have access
to the captain's files!
