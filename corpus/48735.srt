1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Another day in the can.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Good night, Mrs Wonderbottom.

4
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ugliest hairdo I've ever seen.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold the elevator!
Aha!

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Express elevator.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Elevator with a view!

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now that's what I call
an express.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Good Godfrey! Earthquake!

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't panic, everyone.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We've got enough canned food here
to cover any emergency.

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's better.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Carry on, boys.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Parking lot. Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Whoopsie.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
By George, somebody fix the lights...

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
before anyone trips.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The escalator to the parking lot.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Such sophistication!

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Right turn only.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Road hog!

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Blasted potholes!

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The checkered flag?

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Magoo, you, you speed demon, you!

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You've still got it.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
El Nino's back.

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And tonight, Quincy Magoo,
the canned vegetable king...

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
will dedicate the new museum wing
he has donated to the city.

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The Magoo Rotunda will house
a travelling exhibit...

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
of the treasures of Kuristan...

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
including the rarest of all rubies,
the Star of Kuristan.

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Treat her gently, young fella.

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Check underneath. I think
there's something rattling there.

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yes, you dropped the keys, my boy.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's the most precious ruby
in the world.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Lovely.
- It's just gorgeous.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- It's exquisite.
- Exquisite.

40
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
No. Actually it's corundum.

41
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's an aluminum oxide.

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Okay, don't take my word for it.

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Exquisite is an adjective,
not an element.

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right. If you're so smart,
how come Mr Cloquet told me...

45
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
to watch you like a hawk?

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Cloquet said that?

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why is it that someone always seems
to burn the rumaki?

48
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Maybe you should see
another eye doctor.

49
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo, Hiram has been my optometrist
since I was a small boy in knee pants.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He's like 2,000 years old.
All his other patients are dead.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You can't hold that against him.

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But he's still making appointments
with them.

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Trust me, you need a second opinion.

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, my gosh!

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Would you, would you look at that!
- What?

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Wait, don't look. Don't look.

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- What?
- She's coming this way.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Mr Magoo?

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Stacey Sampanahoditra
of the Kuristani foreign office.

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh. This is my nephew Waldo.

61
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo Magoo. It is an honour.

62
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh.

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, you'll have to forgive him
sometimes.

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He gets like that, lost in thought.
Quite a scholar, you know.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Graduated with a large class.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Isn't that right, Waldo?
Waldo?

67
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo!

68
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yeah. L-l, I w-went there to college.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh.

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, Waldo, why don't you invite,
uh, Stacey to our opera tomorrow night?

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I would be most honoured, sir.

72
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stacey...

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
will you join us
for the opera tomorrow night?

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's a, uh, benefit performance.

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, we're doing excerpts
from the Norsemen saga.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I look forward to it.
Please excuse me.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I must greet diplomats.

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's a very attractive young lady.

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But I'm, I'm such a fool.
l-I tried to offer her a snack.

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Waldo, don't be so hard on yourself.
Cupid makes fools of us all.

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And now, as curator of this museum...

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
it is my pleasure
to present our benefactor...

83
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
a man of great vision,
Quincy Magoo.

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Step right this way, sir.
- Ah, well, thank you, thank you.

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, well, may, uh, may all
of the exhibits in this hall...

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
chime with the light
of human knowledge.

87
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
My dear, thank you.
Thank you.

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey!

89
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Look out! Watch out!

90
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, yes.

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!

92
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What is this, indoor fireworks?

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What a wonderful touch.

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Excuse me.

95
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Or a blackout.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I should inform the power company here.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Get that fixed,
and get these lights back on.

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hello down here.
Public telephone.

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, what... Excuse me, sir.
We have an emergency...

100
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!

101
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We have an injured man here.
Bandaged from head to foot.

102
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Help. Some assistance, please.

103
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And whoever did it
has stolen the telepho...

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
God! They gave me a bad mask.

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Okay. Go.

106
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I gotta watch her like a hawk.

107
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Morgan!

108
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You just, uh, you just hang on.
I'll get you some medical attention.

109
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You stay right here.
No, you're in no condition...

110
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, well.
How many times must I tell you?

111
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stay back in the booth, man.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll take care of him.

113
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll be back. I'll get some help
or maybe find a telephone.

114
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Freeze! Drop the gun.

115
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Turn around.

116
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yes, sure.
Must be a phone out there somewhere.

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, if you can't bring Mohammed
to the mountain...

118
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Morning, Angus.

119
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Avast, Angus.
Are you ready to cast off?

120
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo? What are you doing here?

121
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, just cleaning your windshield.

122
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Aha, my boy, you are a prince,
but I have a date with a flounder.

123
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Anchors aweigh.
- Anchors aweigh.

124
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, the windshield did need cleaning,
huh? Right, Angus?

125
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I don't think I've seen it
this clear since 1956.

126
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, now that you're here,
we'd better inform the police.

127
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Orders, U.S. State Department.

128
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This incident is to remain
completely under wraps.

129
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Which includes the crazy 9-1-1 call
about a bandaged man in the museum.

130
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We substitute a replica
of the jewel and...

131
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And we open the exhibit
as if nothing has happened.

132
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it. Who the hell are you?
And who told the State Department?

133
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I did. They said they would send two
of their very best operatives.

134
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Gustave Anders, CIA.

135
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

136
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Chuck Stupak, FBl, and
I'm in charge of this investigation.

137
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The CIA has no jurisdiction
on American soil.

138
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This could very well become
an international incident.

139
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Not if you don't get in my way,
fancy pants.

140
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hmm?

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh.

142
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I don't get it.
There's nothing in the papers.

143
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's a trap.

144
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
They're trying to lull us
into a false sense of security...

145
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
and then bust us
when we make a careless move.

146
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We'll never make it to Cloquet's.
They're onto us, Luanne.

147
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- I can feel it in my...
- Morgan, that's yesterday's paper.

148
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh.

149
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Nothing like the old sea air
to clean out the pipes.

150
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Huh? Right, Angus?

151
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The sun is a little hot.
Time to apply the old Ban de Soleil.

152
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There we go.

153
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh. A very refreshing,
minty fragrance.

154
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, the French.
They think of everything.

155
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What's that? The old fog
rolling in, thick as pea soup?

156
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Not my pea soup, mind you,
but maybe one of those other brands.

157
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Bob, why steal the Star for your boss,
Cloquet, and get peanuts for it...

158
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
when he can turn around
and auction it off for millions?

159
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why not auction it off ourselves?

160
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That way we get millions
and each other.

161
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Me and you?

162
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I could take you to places
you've never been before.

163
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I've never been to Toronto.

164
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I know a little cosy
bed-and-breakfast place in Toronto...

165
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
but we could skip the breakfast part.

166
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, Angus. We won't let
a little fog stop us, huh?

167
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You rotten seagulls!

168
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You con-sarned buzzards, you!

169
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uncivilized behaviour.
I'd never do anything like that to you.

170
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm gonna have to get this
dry-cleaned now.

171
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Blast your...

172
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ho-ho-ho. I've got a strike.

173
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, shiver my timbers!
It's a lunker!

174
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Just call me Ishmael.

175
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's Moby Dick!

176
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why, look at that... Look at...

177
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Look at that, Angus.
It's huge.

178
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He was a big one, Angus.

179
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Just look at the size
of those, uh, uh, pants.

180
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, I'd say we were in
the Bermuda Triangle...

181
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
but we're nowhere near Bermuda.

182
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll just play it safe
and head for shore.

183
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, Angus, here we are in safe harbour
once again.

184
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, an escalator to the top.

185
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
How swank.

186
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Must be a yacht club.

187
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus?

188
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus, where are you, boy?

189
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, hello, Angus.
Come on there, fella.

190
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We believe Magoo created a diversion
while his accomplices stole the jewel.

191
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But why? Mr Magoo
is a very wealthy man.

192
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Are you sure about that? People do eat
a lot more fresh food these days.

193
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Okay, we don't collar Magoo.
We put him under surveillance.

194
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But this is absurdity. I'm to be
his guest at the opera tonight.

195
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great! You can be our inside person.

196
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That is, if it's all right
with the FBI.

197
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
So, Magoo has the Star of Kuristan.

198
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But it was Luanne's fault!

199
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
She double-crossed us.

200
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I shouldn't have hired her.

201
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But she's the only one capable
of stealing the Star.

202
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
How could someone with such beauty...

203
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
be so treacherous?

204
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I worship all that is beautiful,
Morgan.

205
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The greatest sin is to destroy
a thing of beauty.

206
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I fear now we must destroy
the beautiful Miss Le Seur.

207
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Kill her.

208
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But first, get the stone, all right?

209
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Tomorrow buyers are arriving from
all over the world to bid on the ruby.

210
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Schmidt. Gosher. Havzinski.

211
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I hear there's a rumour
Ortega Peru might even show.

212
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The Piranha?
The king of the underworld?

213
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Morgan,
don't screw this up, hmm?

214
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm coming. On my way!

215
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Hello, sir.
- Um, oh, Stacey!

216
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

217
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I thought that Waldo was going to pick
you up, uh, on the way to the opera.

218
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, in my country, the invitee
always picks up the inviter.

219
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm sure that Waldo
would not have it any other way.

220
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, I need to borrow a tie.

221
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Oh, hi, Stacey.
- Hello, Waldo.

222
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, why don't you, uh, show Stacey
the garden before you leave?

223
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's quiet and, uh, and peaceful...

224
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
and, uh, intimate.

225
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
l, l, I don't think
she'd want to see the...

226
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'd love to see more
of your charming home.

227
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right. It's, uh...
It's right back here.

228
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The smell of rice is in the air.

229
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Love in bloom,
if ever I've seen it before.

230
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus? Come on, now.
How many times...

231
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
have I told you
to stay out of that closet?

232
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on in here, boy.
Help me with my scales.

233
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's my uncle's work.

234
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh.

235
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,518  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Never have I seen
such a plant sculpture.

236
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Topiary's kind of a hobby of his.

237
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And he specializes in the abstract.

238
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, no.
That's a bunny rabbit.

239
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey, well. What...
What is... What is that?

240
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh. So you want to play fetch again?
Is that it?

241
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, well, it's a dog's life.

242
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Here we go.
There it goes.

243
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Your uncle, do you think
he needs glasses?

244
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, and how!
Just don't try and tell him that.

245
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He will not spend the money?
I notice he drives a very old car.

246
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Is his business not healthy?

247
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, no. No.
He just loves that old car.

248
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And if Unc loves something,
he won't let it go.

249
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus! Stop terrorizing the squirrels.

250
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Stupak!
- Where are you?

251
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Right behind you.
Don't turn around.

252
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Just spotted a conspicuous white male.

253
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Dirty clothes,
needs a haircut.

254
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Sticks out like a sore thumb.
- Where is he? Can't see him. Over.

255
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Right behind you.
Turn around. Don't turn around.

256
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Walk backwards.
- What?

257
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Walk backwards.

258
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
More! More.

259
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
More. Stop.

260
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Where?
- Look to your left.

261
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Rolvaag

262
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
King of Norway

263
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Aha. Uh, one minute, please.

264
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, uh, may I help you?

265
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, that voice.

266
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The timbre! The tone!

267
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It belongs to the world,
but for the moment it's mine alone.

268
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And I tremble.

269
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella.

270
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Mr Magoo, I presume?
- Uh, yes.

271
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And, uh, you are, um...

272
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella. Prunella Pagliacci,
reporter for "The Opera News."

273
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella. I knew a young lady once
named Prunella.

274
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Mr Magoo, w-will you consent
to an interview?

275
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, why not? Uh, back here,
uh, tonight, after the show.

276
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh. No, l, I wouldn't want to share you
with all of your well-wishers.

277
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, well, uh, uh, uh,
a private, uh, rendezvous.

278
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, a walk on the beach
at, uh, Sandy Cove...

279
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
uh, shall we say, noon tomorrow?

280
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll be there early.

281
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Be wonderful tonight.

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, uh...

283
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!
Uh, did you hear that, Angus?

284
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
She doesn't want to share me
with anyone.

285
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Is it possible after all these years,
another duet at last?

286
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
"O Solo Mio" no more.

287
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stupak. Stupak!
Where are you?

288
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Rolvaag
king of Norway

289
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Rolvaag
king of Norway

290
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Break a leg, Mr Magoo.
- Ah, Rumford, yes.

291
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Thank you, uh, Sam.

292
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Rolvaag

293
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
King of Norway

294
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Where am I?
Oh, backstage.

295
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Let's go.

296
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stupak, where are you?

297
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What's going on in there?

298
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Rolvaag
king of Norway

299
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Go out there a nobody,
come back a star.

300
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Open the throat,
sing from the diaphragm.

301
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And remember, always sit down
whenever you can.

302
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That man's got a very big head.

303
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, stage, uh...
Stage, uh... Stage left.

304
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Time to warm up
for the old fight scene.

305
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Get over there and shut off that fan!

306
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Bravo!

307
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am a crusty
lusty Viking

308
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That was the note that brought a lump
to the judges' throats.

309
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
After that, I knew
the Van Cliburn award was mine.

310
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, the years have not dimmed
its beauty.

311
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, thank you.
Any, uh, more questions?

312
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, not that I want
this interview to end.

313
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, me, too. It's just,
just been such a thrill...

314
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
to hear the story of your life in song,
Mr Magoo, I mean real...

315
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, please, please, please, dear.
Call me Quincy.

316
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Quincy, I'm really happy
I got this chance to know you.

317
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'd like to get to know you better.

318
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, Prunella, could this be
a new beginning?

319
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Yes, of the end.
- Of the end?

320
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, the end of loneliness.

321
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The beginning of discovery.

322
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
How nice.

323
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- This is a very special day, Prunella.
- Oh, for me, too, Quincy.

324
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, then you know that this is
the opening of the carp fishing season?

325
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Of course!
- Oh, Great Scott!

326
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And I'm so happy
we're experiencing it together.

327
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
As am I. Eh, together, yes.
I learned that the hard way.

328
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
When you have something precious,
you must keep it in sight all the time.

329
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Something precious,
such as, say, a jewel?

330
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yes, indeed.
The most precious jewel of all.

331
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What does this jewel look like?

332
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
My jewel is luminous, sparkling.
A flaming red...

333
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Ruby?
- Ruby, yes!

334
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Where do you keep this ruby?
- Close to my heart.

335
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Quincy.

336
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, I'm sorry, Quincy,
but l, I want you to kiss me.

337
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, well, it's, uh...

338
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
No, b-but not here. Someplace.
Someplace private, like a, like a boat.

339
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Do you happen to have a boat?

340
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, in two words:
"Anchors aweigh."

341
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella. Uh...

342
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, my boat is just down here.

343
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh.

344
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Bingo!

345
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, no.
It's Luanne Le Seur.

346
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The Black Widow.

347
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
She kills all of her male accomplices.
No one has ever been able to finger her.

348
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Wow. Whoever brings her in
will get a big promotion.

349
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Maybe a book deal.
- Hey, where're you going?

350
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Nothing like the warm sea air.

351
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Huh? Lo... Look at that.

352
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The, the fish are jumping and...

353
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Look at that.
Isn't that wonderful?

354
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Dear me.
- Now, Quincy, there's an idea.

355
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why don't we do some fishing?
Where do you keep your tackle box?

356
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, my tackle box
is back at the house.

357
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, but this is wonderful.
The open sea, it's magnificent.

358
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And so inspirational.
Isn't it wonderful?

359
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh! Oh!

360
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- What? What? What is it?
- I think I sprained my ankle.

361
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, I'll call the emergency sea rescue.

362
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, no, no, no, no. L-lt'll be okay.
I just need to rest it.

363
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, well, you, you come on up front now.
Be careful.

364
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Okay.
- We'll take care of you, and...

365
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Just sit down, and I'll head
for the shore.

366
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Oh, could we go to your house?
- Ah!

367
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, I'll put the wheel to the keel
and the gas to the mast!

368
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am a rusty
crusty Viking

369
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I hope I'm to your liking

370
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well?

371
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- How do I look?
- Wow!

372
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo, we mustn't.

373
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, w-why not?
l-ls there someone else?

374
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- It's Mr Magoo.
- What?

375
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Your government thinks Mr Magoo
stole the Star of Kuristan.

376
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well...

377
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
A-And you?
Do you think he did it?

378
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo, I need your help.

379
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey, we don't have a warrant...

380
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
so be quick about it,
or we've both had it.

381
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
One, two, three.

382
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Testing. One, two, three.
- Got it, loud and clear.

383
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Mayday! Mayday!
Magoo! He's back.

384
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm a lusty
crusty Viking

385
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I hope I'm to your liking

386
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And I'm a Viking woman

387
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
A lusty, busty charmer

388
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Please let me pierce your armour
And together we'll find love

389
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- All right.
- Oh, no. Don't. Put me down.

390
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Here we go.
- My ankle's fine.

391
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Here we go.

392
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah. Well...

393
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
with a little more practise,
l, uh, could pop the question.

394
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Quincy.

395
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, your house is beautiful.
Do you mind if I look around?

396
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Look away. Look away.

397
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll just put my hat
in the closet here, and...

398
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
May I make you a cocktail?

399
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, I'm famished. Do you think
you could cook us something?

400
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Something hot?

401
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Can I cook?

402
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You may call me "Cordon Bleu" Magoo.

403
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, which way
to the little girls' room?

404
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, atop the stairs.
Let me light your way.

405
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, ah, your repast awaits you
down here, my dove.

406
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Next I want you to put some water
on to boil.

407
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And while we're waiting for that,
let's clean about, oh...

408
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
two or three sprigs of parsley.

409
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Water on to boil.

410
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Next, pat the chicken dry.

411
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, take some lemon
and rub it on the chicken.

412
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, make sure you get the whole
chicken. Lift the leg if you have to.

413
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, I hope you're not cheating
and using bottled lemon juice.

414
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
If you are,
it just won't taste as good.

415
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why? Well, no peel appeal.

416
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus, there you are, old friend.

417
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, I can't play right now.

418
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I don't have any time.

419
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And now, lift both legs
high into the air. Left and right.

420
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right, then. Just one last time,
then you take it upstairs.

421
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right.

422
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, don't be a slacker.
You can do it.

423
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Lift those legs!

424
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Left and right.
Back and forth.

425
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
One, and two, and three, and four.

426
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, you can do it.
Lift both legs high into the air.

427
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Lift them left and right.
And left and right.

428
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, you can do it.
Lift those legs high into the air.

429
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And dance!

430
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on.
Get your rear into gear.

431
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, don't stop
until you're ready to drop.

432
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now you're cookin'!

433
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Go get some sandpaper,
and sand that sucker smooth.

434
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You don't want any bumps
on the surface.

435
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I recommend a medium grade paper
because...

436
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
if you use a sandpaper that's too fine,
you're gonna be at it all day.

437
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, whatever you do,
do not use a metal file...

438
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
because that will shred the surface
to a pulp.

439
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Must be a Chinese recipe
to make the chicken tender.

440
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Either that, or it's German.

441
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Use short, light strokes,
and watch out for surface abrasions.

442
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't rush it.
These things take time.

443
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc?

444
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I want him.
Magoo is goin' down!

445
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You hear me?
- What?

446
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on!

447
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now...

448
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
after you finish drilling,
you want to make sure that
you squirt some caulk into those holes.

449
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc.

450
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There's something very important
we need to talk about.

451
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo, Waldo. How did you know?
I thought this was my little secret.

452
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Then it's true!

453
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yes, and a lot of people
are in for a big surprise.

454
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Have you gone insane?
- Yes! Yes, l...

455
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You have gone insane.
- Insane. Insane with passion.

456
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Their names are even the same:
Prunella.

457
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Prunella?
- Prunella.

458
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, oh, oh, you're talk...
You're talking... That's wonderful, Unc.

459
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's time that you met
this glorious thief...

460
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
who has stolen my heart.

461
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, I'll be right back.
Prunella!

462
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella!

463
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, my gosh!
He did do it.

464
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Aha! There you are,
my Viking princess.

465
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come. I want you to meet someone.

466
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Not now.

467
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I can't wait any longer, Quincy.
I'm gonna ask you once, and only once.

468
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, you're going to propose!

469
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, my precious bonbon.

470
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You read my mind.

471
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You know what I came here for.
You know what I want. Give it to me.

472
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, you modern women.
You're so direct.

473
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus.

474
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now what is this? Oh, we've been
playing fetch all day with this.

475
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right, boy, go ahead.

476
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it!

477
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, who is this?

478
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, Waldo Magoo, this is, uh,
Prunella Pagliacci.

479
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm FBI. That man just stole
the Star of Kuristan.

480
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stole? In this house?

481
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- He's heading for the driveway.
- Get up.

482
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- He stole the Studebaker.
- What?

483
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The eggplant mobile.

484
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What? Watch your head.
This way.

485
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it! Stop or I'll shoot.

486
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- Don't worry. He's not gonna get away.

487
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

488
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Unc, there he is.
- Ah, yeah, all right.

489
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- No, over there, over there.
- I see him. I see him.

490
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- He's turning left.
- Left it is.

491
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He's turning right.
Big truck! Big truck!

492
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold on!

493
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He's a crafty fella.
Taking evasive action. That won't work!

494
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You're not getting away.
- That's the wrong car.

495
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
He's back there.

496
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't worry, my boy.
We'll catch him on the turnaround.

497
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold on, Angus!

498
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey, look out!

499
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Stop!
- Look out!
- Stop!

500
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't panic, now.
We're only in some kind of tunnel.

501
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Brakes! Brakes, Unc!

502
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, hit the brake!

503
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!
Those speed bumps. I tell ya.

504
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll sue this city.

505
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, Prunella, uh, about the FBI.
You were saying?

506
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yeah, uh, uh, FBI.
l, I'm... I'm an undercover agent...

507
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
for the government.

508
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Does this mean no story
in "The Opera News"?

509
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm sorry I had to deceive you.

510
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
They think you stole
the Star of Kuristan.

511
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

512
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What? They, they what?

513
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That burglar in your house was really
a notorious jewel thief...

514
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
who works for a man
named Austin Cloquet.

515
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The bureau has learned that Cloquet
plans to sell the jewel...

516
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
tomorrow at a secret auction
up at a ski lodge.

517
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Every billionaire gangster
in the world is coming...

518
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
except the most powerful of them all:
Ortega Peru, The Piranha.

519
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
No one's ever seen him.
He never goes anywhere.

520
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
So if we could get someone
to impersonate Peru...

521
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
we could get close to the gem
and recover it.

522
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
But who?

523
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We lost him right here,
and Magoo didn't return home all night.

524
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why is he always
one step ahead of me?

525
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Kenyawa Tambe just charged some tickets
to a ski resort.

526
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yeah, so what?

527
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Kenyawa Tambe is one
of Luanne's aliases.

528
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I just found out.

529
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

530
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You know, we're supposed to be working
as a team here.

531
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You're going around behind my back.
- If the pressure's too much for you...

532
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You'll take over! You'll take over!
- Sirs!

533
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I shall go with you.

534
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
No. Young lady, this is strictly a job
for professionals.

535
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Then why are the two of you going?

536
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Welcome to the Rockies, gentlemen.

537
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
If you'll follow me to the limo,
I'll take you to Austin Cloquet.

538
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Who the hell are you?

539
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ortega Peru.
What's it to you?

540
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Mr Peru never goes anywhere.

541
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's right.
I never go anywhere.

542
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
So when I go somewhere,
everyone thinks I am nowhere...

543
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
when I'm really there.

544
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, let's put this show on the road.

545
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,798  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, sorry.
Mr Peru, uh, this way.

546
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There are no signs.

547
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
So you've been staking out my uncle
all this time.

548
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Is that right?

549
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's my job.

550
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And the way you say you feel about him,
is, is that part of your job, too?

551
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You all right, boy?

552
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You saw this man?

553
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yeah. He just went up the mountain.
Said his name was Ortega Peru.

554
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Magoo is Peru?

555
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Magoo, The Piranha.

556
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This is big.

557
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We're gonna need some backup.

558
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't you know how to open a door?

559
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

560
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We're especially honoured today
to have with us Mr Ortega Peru.

561
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I was going to kill someone
this morning...

562
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
but I did it last night
so that I could be here.

563
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, you're too kind.

564
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, when you've changed
your clothes, these lovely ladies...

565
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
are waiting to serve you
with chilled champagne in the solarium.

566
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Thank you.

567
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Not bad. What do they mean?

568
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Every time I kill a man...

569
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I tattoo his portrait
on my body.

570
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What do you do when you run out of room?
Stop killing people?

571
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey, I bet Peru's got
some pretty nice tattoos.

572
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You hombres, uh, go on ahead.

573
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I have got to use
the, uh, powder room.

574
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on!

575
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Let's go!

576
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Champagne?
- Oh, yes.

577
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

578
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Thank you.

579
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, now that we're all here,
may I have your attention, please.

580
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This is where
our little adventure began.

581
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Gentlemen, may I present...

582
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
the Star of Kuristan.

583
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The auction will commence
when you write down your opening bids.

584
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, I do not pass my cash...

585
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
until I get a close look
at the dingus.

586
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Give it to me in my hand.

587
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Mr Peru?

588
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Your frog is leaking.

589
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh. Well.

590
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Gentlemen.

591
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We have an impostor.
Mr Peru is Mr Magoo.

592
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Why would Peru disguise himself
as Magoo?

593
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Shut up, you idiot, and get him!

594
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Keep your distance!
This hepcat has a black belt in mayhem.

595
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it!

596
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Give me the Star of Kuristan.

597
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The Star is mine!

598
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella!

599
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The auction is off. Get out.

600
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, go!

601
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
My dear! By gum,
you almost had me fooled.

602
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, watch out.
She's got a gun.

603
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Of course she has, Waldo!
She's a federal agent.

604
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
She's not what you think!

605
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, Waldo, you're talking about
the woman who saved my life.

606
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

607
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, you can't tell me that yesterday
meant nothing to you.

608
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am a Viking
A lusty, trusty Viking

609
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yesterday sucked.

610
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And you kissed a carp.

611
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella.

612
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Give me the jewel!
- This is all you ever wanted?

613
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You're a true gentleman,
and there aren't many of those left.

614
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Too bad you had to go
and get in my way.

615
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right, I got the gun now.
Halt or I'll fire!

616
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't shoot!
It's me! Waldo!

617
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!
Waldo, she's bamboozled me!

618
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
She, she, she, she, she's a, a sneak.
Uh, after her!

619
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
W-Wait. That'll be easier
with your clothes on.

620
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, yeah, clothes.
Oh, yes, yes, clothes.

621
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This way.

622
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Police!
- Let's beat it!

623
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it!

624
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, let's go!

625
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Look out! Freeze!

626
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Hold it!
- Keep your hands up!

627
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- There!
- Come with me.

628
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Get that man!

629
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it!

630
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You'll just have to wait your turn.

631
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- She's over there!
- Where?

632
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There!

633
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- It's too late. It's all over.
- Balderdash, Waldo!

634
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It ain't over
until we've cleared our good name.

635
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Aha-ha! A snowboard.

636
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
After her, my boy!

637
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Wait, Unc, no!
- It's as easy as pie!

638
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's the wrong kind of board!

639
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold it!

640
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Hold on, Angus!
- Stupak, go after them!

641
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The women's boarder cross final
is about to begin.

642
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ready, set, go!

643
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Get back here, you Jezebel!

644
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll catch you, Prunella!

645
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And the winner of the women's
boarder cross final is a man!

646
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
A man? On an ironing board.

647
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey!

648
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Excuse me.
- Up there.

649
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Halt!
Hold it right there!

650
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, a detour.
I'll get you, Prunella!

651
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Freeze!

652
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Watch out!

653
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What?

654
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc?

655
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc! Unc!

656
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Are you all right?

657
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't take that detour, Waldo!

658
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stay right there.
We'll be right down.

659
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, buddy.

660
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Look! There's
some footprints down there!

661
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
They went that way!
Come on!

662
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This is a good idea, Waldo.
You're the real McCoy.

663
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
A true Magoo.

664
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I want Magoo.

665
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Who can imagine?
Luanne Le Seur and Mr Magoo.

666
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Yes, we're talking best-seller.

667
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- I can't believe they did it.
- That's it! That's the title!

668
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, we just have to check the airports
and search all the hotels...

669
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
and make sure
they don't get away.

670
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Senor Peru.

671
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
One moment, my darling.
Yes?

672
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The Star of Kuristan is ready
for delivery. You have 15 million?

673
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Of course. It will make
a fitting gift for my fiancee.

674
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- We are to be married this weekend.
- I'll be there tomorrow.

675
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Good.

676
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The Star of Kuristan.

677
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Uh, excuse me.

678
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Do you have a Luanne Le Seur
registered here?

679
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'll be with you in a moment.

680
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
If you'd just sign here.

681
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Now, who did you want?
- Luanne Le Seur. Is she registered here?

682
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
See, we got an airline
late-luggage delivery...

683
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
but the party's not staying
at our hotel, so we're checking.

684
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I see.

685
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What hotel are you with?

686
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The St. Paul.

687
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I see.

688
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It says "Fantasy World Costume Rental."

689
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Haven't they let you out
a little before Halloween?

690
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Madam.
- Oh, thank you, young man.

691
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Have a good afternoon, madam.

692
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus. Angus.
Now, stop that.

693
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, let's get out of here.
He's onto us.

694
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Let go.
- Angus, no!

695
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- He's attacking that old lady!
- Great Scott!

696
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unhand that woman, Angus.

697
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Let me see.

698
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Wow!

699
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey, lady,
you forgot your stuff.

700
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What's that?

701
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's an airline receipt
made out to "Prunella Pagliacci."

702
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Prunella Pagliacci?
That woman is an impostor.

703
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Unc, that was Luanne Le Seur.
- Well, there, you see?

704
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
That's why Angus went after her.

705
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!

706
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We had her within our grasp,
and she slipped through our fingers.

707
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Balls of fire!
Oh, good dog, Angus. Good dog.

708
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This receipt is for Brazil.
Why would she go to Brazil?

709
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- She's going to Peru.
- She'd go to Brazil to go to Peru?

710
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Exactly.
- But why?

711
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
To get more for the ruby.

712
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Peru?
- Exactly.

713
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- But then why go to Brazil?
- Peru is in Brazil.

714
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Peru is in Brazil?
- Ortega Peru is in Brazil.

715
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ortega Peru! Of course.

716
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And that's why we're going to Brazil.

717
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, Waldo.

718
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, l, I think this is the place.

719
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Attaboy, Waldo.
Ease up there, Angus.

720
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I like your badge.

721
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Angus.

722
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm going on ahead.
You stay here.

723
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm gonna eyeball the situation.

724
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, um, m-maybe I should do
the eyeballing.

725
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Father.

726
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Maybe we should leave out the bit
about "till death do us part."

727
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- She's nervous enough already.
- Jefe.

728
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Luanne Le Seur is here, Jefe.

729
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Javier, after Rosita and I go
to EuroDisney...

730
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
have the Le Seur woman killed,
but quietly.

731
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
If you disturb my guests,
I will be very disappointed.

732
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Monkey bars. Must be
a children's playground.

733
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh! Hello, little girl.

734
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Did I interrupt you
in your afternoon nappy?

735
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, now, we mustn't let
the grown-ups know that we're here.

736
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now here's something sweet,
a chocolate.

737
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You go ahead. That's it.

738
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, you go on back to sleep.

739
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There you are, honey.

740
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You're the ugliest child
I've ever seen.

741
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And needs a change of diaper, too.

742
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, oh, Waldo.
Hold on.

743
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The little angel is trying to sleep.
So, you know...

744
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, where did she go?
Kids. Can't sit still for a second.

745
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ah, well, I think
she's run off there...

746
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
where she can have
her chocolate in private.

747
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, Waldo, this is the plan.

748
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I will gain entry to the house
through a window.

749
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You keep an eye on the lawn party
and spot Luanne Le Seur if you can.

750
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo, you need to take some Tic-Tacs.

751
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Unc, it's not me.
- Please, please. L, l...

752
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am talking to someone here, Waldo.
Now, please.

753
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Now, what you have to do is...

754
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!

755
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Step on it, Unc!

756
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stop! Stop! Go back!

757
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, Angus! Come on!

758
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Good boy.

759
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, there's Luanne.

760
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right.
Now, I'll nab him.

761
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You keep your eye on Le Suer,
but don't forget:

762
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
She's smart, dangerous, ruthless,
soft, beautiful, a good kisser...

763
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Unc!
- Huh? Yeah, all right, all right.

764
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Keep your eye open for pitfalls.

765
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
How are you?

766
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Senorita Le Seur,
at last we meet.

767
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You have the Star?
- Do you have the 15 million?

768
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It may take them time to count.

769
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Please stay for the wedding. Afterwards,
I will have Javier take care of you.

770
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Thank you.

771
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Do it quietly
and don't disturb the guests...

772
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
or I'll be very disappointed.

773
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Kid, are you lost?

774
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I was looking for the pool.

775
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Wow! Oh, it's beautiful.
- Ooh, pretty, yes?

776
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- I'll go get the bridesmaids.
- Okay.

777
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hello?

778
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh!

779
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Time for a little Red Cross here,
Magoo.

780
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Let me see.

781
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, my dear child!

782
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You should have your dentist
file down those teeth.

783
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Rosita? Darling?

784
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Are you with no clothes on?

785
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Is everything all right?

786
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm crazy with the love, mi amor.

787
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I will see you soon,
my precious flower.

788
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Before we take our sacred vows,
precious one, I have a surprise.

789
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
So do I!
Adios, amor. Nuevo nacho.

790
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It wouldn't last.
I've never loved you.

791
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Get him!
- Out of the way!

792
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo?

793
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Unc, help! Over here!

794
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- This is no time for a rope exercise.
- Unc, that thing's down here.

795
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Good Lord!
- The rope, Unc, get the rope.

796
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- The rope?
- Magoo!

797
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
This is the rope
that can save the boy.

798
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
All right, let's have at it.

799
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I will exchange the ruby
for the rope.

800
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Of course, take it. Take it.
But help me with the boy.

801
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You know, I should have you killed,
but I admire a family man.

802
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- You'll be safe in a minute, Waldo.
- Ready?

803
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Ready.
- Good luck.

804
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hold on there, Waldo.

805
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Helicopter!
Magoo has brought police!

806
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's that way!

807
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Attaboy, Angus. Good boy.
- Whoa! Whoa!

808
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Higher! Pull!
- Good, Angus.

809
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Here we are. Police! Don't move
Stay there!

810
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ortega Peru!
He's escaping that way!

811
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
No one escapes Magoo.

812
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There goes the bride.

813
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, man! You'd think Peru
could've done better than that.

814
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Magoo's dog!
Let's get him!

815
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You weren't leaving without me,
were you?

816
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
There's the getaway limo.
Hold your horses!

817
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Unc!
- Arrest him!

818
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Call the chopper!
We have to stop him!

819
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Show me the ruby.

820
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Big nasty woman!
Get back!

821
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Thank you. Crime never pays, my boy.
Could you pull over?

822
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'd like to get off.

823
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Ortega Peru, you are under arrest!
Land your helicopter now!

824
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't panic.
We're dropping down a raft.

825
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Swim toward the raft.

826
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hurry up.
Swim toward the raft.

827
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We are dropping you a line.

828
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You'll have to hook it up
to the raft.

829
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Then we will pull you to safety.
- Got you now, missy.

830
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stay calm.

831
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hook it to the raft.

832
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:28,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Quincy, please, give me the jewel.
You and me together...

833
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Luanne Le Seur, you have
the heart of an artichoke.

834
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Stop wasting time!
You're headed for a waterfall.

835
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Great Scott!

836
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
We're safe now.

837
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's hooked to the raft.
Pull us up.

838
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, look at that rainbow, Magoo.
You just might be a leprechaun.

839
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
La Cascada de Muerte,
the Falls of Death...

840
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
where many a bride
left stranded at the alter...

841
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
has jumped to her final...

842
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, my goodness!
Another one! Aye!

843
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Are you all right, dear?
- W-Well, I'm, I'm all right.

844
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I'm, I'm fine.

845
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, that's the spirit, dear.
You'll find someone else.

846
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
It's inner beauty that counts.

847
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Words of wisdom, my dear.

848
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Words of wisdom.

849
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Magoo, you've done it again.
Have a good day.

850
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Whoa!

851
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Who are you?
What are you doing?

852
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I am Simone Deculaat,
the wedding caterer.

853
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, you'll love prison, Simone.
They make great "loaf de meat."

854
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
Get a picture.

855
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
How's my hair look?

856
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Well done.
- Very nice.

857
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Thank you.

858
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Waldo, thank you.

859
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, you're welcome.

860
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
What will you do now?

861
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, Uncle Quincy just created
a new position for me in his company.

862
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You're looking at
the head of security.

863
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And now that you have found
your path in life...

864
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I suppose you would not be willing
to return to Kuristan with me.

865
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
In a heartbeat.

866
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, you don't have to.

867
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
I like it here much better.

868
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
- Wow!
- Oh, Waldo!

869
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Mr Magoo. Um, sorry we, uh,
put you through all that.

870
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Would you autograph this for us?

871
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
By Jove! A-And a very good likeness
of me, too, I must say.

872
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
You boys certainly move fast.

873
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
The TV movie airs Friday.

874
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Quite right. Quite right.
Always keep moving.

875
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, Angus.

876
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Have a good day.

877
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Well, Angus, it looks like
it's just you and me now.

878
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't take this wrong, but I feel
that there's someone out there...

879
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
the perfect somebody just for me...

880
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
and someday Cupid is gonna fire
into the heart of the bull's-eye.

881
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
And this is one steep staircase.

882
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Good exercise
for an old dinosaur like me.

883
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Indeed! Oh, by Jupiter!

884
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again!

885
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh. Pardon me, madam.

886
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Oh, Magoo, you dog!

887
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:29,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
B-mark.

888
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, now. One and two. One and two.

889
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Higher! One and two. One and two.

890
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Don't stop until you're ready to drop.

891
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
Come on, left leg. Keep going.
One and two. One and two.

892
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:572
