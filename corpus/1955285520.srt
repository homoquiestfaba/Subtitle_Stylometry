Ooh.
That's Harsh.

184
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,507
But It Doesn't Come Close To My Record.

185
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,009
When I Was
In Ninth Grade,

186
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,478
He Tried Keeping Me After School For 4 Months...

187
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,280
Till I
Weaseled Out Of It.

188
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,980
How'd You Manage That,
Slick?

189
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,349
Oh, Put On My Best
"So Sorry" Face,

190
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:48,186
And Traded Detention For An Extracurricular Activity.

191
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,988
Sweet.

192
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,056
Yeah.

193
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,090
Kinda Like You.

194
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,904
Ok, Ms. Kim,
I Made My Corrections.

195
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,005
Would You Please
Type That Up?

196
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,641
No Problem.

197
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,641
Thank You.

198
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,846
Uh, Mr. Zavala,
It Says Ms. Bartlett Went To Juilliard--

199
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:16,013
You Know,
That Amazing Performing School In New York--

200
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,016
On A Dance Scholarship.

201
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:20,384
Are You Filing The Resumes Or Reading The Resumes,
Miss Reyna?

202
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,888
I Didn't Mean To, Sir,
But It Just Jumped Right Out.

203
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,823
I Mean, I've Been
Really Stressed

204
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,390
Since I Found Out
We Had No Dance Coach.

205
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,759
Do You Even Know If Ms. Bartlett Would Be Interested?

206
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,162
Well, Can't You
Force Her To Do It?

207
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,498
Well, Contrary To What I Try
To Make You Students Believe,

208
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,867
I Really Don't Have
That Kind Of Power.

209
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,168
All After-School Coaches
Are Volunteers.

210
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,403
But You'll Talk To Her,
Right?

211
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,272
Please?

212
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,876
I'll See What I Can Do.

213
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,744
<I>Gracias.

214
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,744
<I>De Nada.

215
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,881
Good Morning,
Ms. Bartlett.

216
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,548
Ooh, This Can't Be Good.

217
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:51,549
I Have A Favor
To Ask.

218
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:53,084
It's Been Brought
To My Attention

219
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,453
That You Have
A Background In Dance.

220
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,520
Well,
That Was A Long Time Ago.

221
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:57,788
It's Not Something
I've Kept Up With.

222
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,424
Did You Know We Have A Ninth-Grade Dance Team

223
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:01,525
Here At Marshall?

224
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,629
And Our Squad's Been
A Bit, Uh...

225
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,732
How Do I Say This?
[Chuckles]

226
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,566
Ok, We Have
A Statewide Reputation

227
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,734
For Being
A Perennial Disaster,

228
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,737
But These Girls
Are Counting On It.

229
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,537
They Have
The Enthusiasm.

230
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:14,473
All They're Lacking
Is A Coach.

231
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,640
I Don't Mean
To Be Rude, Sir,

232
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,909
But If You're Angling
To Get Me Involved,

233
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,543
Let Me Save You
The Breath.

234
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:20,745
Dancing's
A Part Of My Past.

235
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,413
All Right,
Then Let Me Try This Approach.

236
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:24,148
Studies Show
That Participating

237
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:25,484
In Extracurricular
Activities

238
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,585
Help Keep These Kids
Out Of Gangs

239
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,454
And Give Them
A Sense Of Self-Respect.

240
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,456
I Understand.
I'm Sure That's True,

241
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,792
But Considering The Way
Things Have Gone So Far,

242
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,826
I Think It's Gonna Take
All My Time And Energy

243
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,162
Just To Focus On Reaching
The Students In My Classroom.

244
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,397
Well, Do Me A Favor.

245
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:42,133
Please... Think About It.

246
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,103
Ok.

247
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:58,649
Yes, Esmeralda?

248
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:00,484
Um...

249
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,488
Well,
I Was Just Wondering

250
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,824
If Mr. Zavala Talked To You About Our Dance Team?

251
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:07,258
He Did.

252
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:10,262
So... Are You
Gonna Do It?

253
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:11,463
Are You
Gonna Coach Us?

254
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,998
Oh, Well...

255
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,367
I Really Think I Should
Become More Proficient

256
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,268
In What I Was
Actually <I>Hired To Do

257
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,003
Before I Take
Anything Else On.

258
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,672
Well, If You Want,
I Can Tell You How

259
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,508
Some Of The Really Popular
Teachers Around Here Do It.

260
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,377
Really?

261
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,611
Mm-Hmm.

262
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:28,312
I'd Like That.

263
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:29,513
Will You Coach
The Dance Team?

264
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,550
Oh, Was That The Condition

265
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,484
Under Which You're Going To Give Me Your Advice?

266
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:36,555
Well, Yeah.
You Help Us, I Help You.

267
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,992
Why Not Make It
So Everybody Wins.

268
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,662
May I Have Your Attention,
Please.

269
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:47,065
The Chess Club Will Meet
In The Library

270
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,532
Thursday At 3:30.

271
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:49,801
Bring Your Own Board.

272
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,503
Ninth-Grade Dance Team Tryouts

273
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,503
Shh!

274
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,239
Will Be Tomorrow At 3:30
In The Gym.

275
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:56,841
Be Sure To Bring
Your Own Music.

276
00:12:56,874 --> 00:13:00,077
Any Questions,
Please See Ms. Bartlett.

277
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,047
Yes! Good Job, Esme.
You Did It.

278
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,584
Hey... What's The Deal
With This Dance Team?

279
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,152
Oh, You Hate The Whole Idea, Remember?

280
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,488
Every Time I Ever
Brought It Up, It Was,

281
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,091
"Oh, That's Right.
Losers R Us."

282
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,897
Yeah, But Now I'm Thinkin'
It Could Have Its Upside.

283
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,901
Maybe Along The Way Develop
Some Ol' School Pride.

284
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,002
Check This Out.

285
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,171
Whoa, You Feelin' Ok,<I>
Chica?

286
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:28,172
[Sighs]

287
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,541
Principal Zavala...

288
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:34,413
I Was Out Of Line
Dancing In Class, Sir.

289
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't You Think
My Detention Time

290
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:38,383
Would Be Better Served In A School-Sponsored Activity?

291
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,852
That's Very Mature,
Miss Salinas.

292
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:43,287
Esmeralda?

293
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,526
Since You've Been Spearheading This Whole Endeavor,

294
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,394
Let Me Ask You.

295
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,430
Do You Think That Daisy
Would Make A Positive Addition

296
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,464
To The Dance Squad?

297
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,606
Well, You Definitely Gotta Give
Her Props On Her Dancing.

298
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:06,777
First Word Of Any Disrespect Or Lack Of Commitment

299
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,580
That I Hear
From Ms. Bartlett...

300
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,649
Back In Detention.

301
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:17,088
Slam Dunk.
Assist: Esmeralda.

302
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,093
[Bell Clangs]

303
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,327
You're Welcome, Daisy.

304
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,431
Whatever.

305
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,079
"Dance Team Try-Outs"?

306
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:43,482
<I>Â¿Audicones?

307
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,415
Ah.

308
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:47,752
"Tomorrow 3:30
In The Gymnasium."

309
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,354
<I>Perfecto.

310
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,623
Auditions.

311
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:53,625
That's The Same
In Any Language.

312
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,494
I'll See You There.

313
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,431
Man, Where Is She?

314
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,199
Like I Don't Have
Better Things To Be Doing.

315
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,434
I Knew This Was
Too Good To Be True.

316
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:05,137
She Can Bail,
So Can I.

317
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,205
Chuy's Waiting.

318
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,476
Heading Back To Detention,
Miss Salinas?

319
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,811
Good.
Then Please Sit Down.

320
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,682
All Of You,
Take A Seat.

321
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:20,951
I Cannot Dance
Sitting Down.

322
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:22,488
Rules First.
Then You'll Dance.

323
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,360
Every Team Member Is Required
To Wear Her Gym Uniform,

324
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,462
White Socks,
And Clean Tennis Shoes.

325
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:34,066
Like I'm Really Gonna Be
Scrubbing My Sneaks.

326
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,202
Thanks For Dropping By.

327
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,571
Laces Tied, Shirts Tucked In,
Hair Pulled Back

328
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:40,705
Into A Ponytail Or A Bun.

329
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:43,175
She's Worse
Than Zavala.

330
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,543
Seriously.
Is This Dance Team Or Boot Camp?

331
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,479
Girls Must Attend
Every Practice,

332
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:48,412
And You Must Be On Time.

333
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,917
Sorry. I'm Sorry.

334
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,985
I Had To Drop Off My Brother At My Aunt's House.

335
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,488
Tardiness Is Unacceptable.

336
00:15:56,521 --> 00:16:00,192
No Excuses.

337
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,661
No Team Member Is Allowed
To Have A Failing Grade.

338
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,429
A "D" Will Put You
On Probation.

339
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,063
That Leaves Us Out.

340
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,932
Come On, Joanna.
Let's Get Out Of Here.

341
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,403
<I>Adios.

342
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,038
No Jewelry.
No Dark Lipstick.

343
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:16,041
No Long Painted Fingernails.

344
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,412
Anybody Else Wanna Leave?

345
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,447
Ok, When I Call Your Name,

346
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,883
Come On Down
And Play Your Music.

347
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,551
Try And Keep Your Choreography
To Under A Minute.

348
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:31,089
Choreo--What?

349
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,258
She Means Show Us
Your Best Moves,

350
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,893
And Don't Hold Back,
Got It?

351

[Guys Yelling]

352
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,931
All Right, Let's Go!

[Whistles]

354
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,268
Excuse Me, Mr. Zavala,
Do You Mind?

355
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,736
We're Having
Our Tryouts.

356
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,571
We Practice In Here
Every Tuesday And Thursday.

357
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,873
Y-Y-You're
The Basketball Coach?

358
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:51,575

1026
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:50,719
From The Time I Was 4,

1027
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:53,822
All I Wanted
To Do Was Dance.

1028
00:54:53,855 --> 00:54:54,857
I Took Lessons,

1029
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:56,658
I Got A Lot
Of Positive Feedback,

1030
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:59,395
But Every Time I'd Perform

1031
00:54:59,427 --> 00:55:02,098
In A Recital,
Even At Home,

1032
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,933
My Parents Would Say
The Same Things.

1033
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,069
"That Was Good,
But You Can Do Better."

1034
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:08,770
"Don't Settle For Good.
Be Great."

1035
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:11,773
"We Expect You
To Be The Very Best."

1036
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:14,777
So, I Worked Harder,

1037
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,781
Kept Practicing,
Kept Taking Lessons.

1038
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:21,283

To Get Into Juilliard.

That You Graduated?

00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:36,933
She Read My Resume,
Which Says

1044
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:38,801
I Attended Juilliard.

1045
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:40,101
Daisy: Why?

1046
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:43,605
I Don't Get It.
Why Would You Quit?

1047
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,542
I Was Good.

1048
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,777
But--

1049
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,112
But Not Great.

1050
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,482
I Went To Those First Couple Of Weeks Of Classes,

1051
00:55:53,514 --> 00:55:57,587
And I Saw
The Other Students...

1052
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:00,889
Their Passion...

1053
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:02,958
And Their
Incredible Technique,

1054
00:56:02,991 --> 00:56:04,459
And I Thought--

1055
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,531
I Freaked Out.

1056
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:12,434
I Thought I Don't Belong Here,
I Can't Compete With This.

1057
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,569
I Felt Like Such A Fraud.

1058
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:18,574
So, I Packed My Bags
And Flew Home,

1059
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:23,512
Went To College, And...
Got An Internet Job.

1060
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:24,947

At Marshall?

1061
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,315

00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:34,657
Boom.

1065
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:40,763
When We Were
At Rolling Hills,

1066
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,331
Every Cold-Sweat Nightmare
I Had Ever Had

1067
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:45,266
Came Flooding Back To Me.

1068
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:46,801
When Everything
Fell Apart,

1069
00:56:46,835 --> 00:56:50,173
I Knew I'd Failed
You Guys.

1070
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:53,676
I Didn't Want You
To Compete Again,

1071
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,177
Because I Couldn't
Handle It.

1072
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:03,185
This Isn't At All
About Not Believing In You.

1073
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,788
I Hate That You
Thought That.

1074
00:57:06,822 --> 00:57:10,560
This Is Me.
It's My Stuff, My Fears.

1075
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:17,066
Hey...

1076
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:20,068
Whose Routine Do You Think
Got Us That Trophy Today?

1077
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:21,337
Daisy--

1078
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:24,507
We're Not So Dumb To Think
We Can Do This Without You.

1079
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,074
We Want
To Keep On Going.

1080
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,078
I Don't Know
About That.

1081
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:33,381
If We Pull Through
In The Next 3 Or 4 Weeks,

1082
00:57:33,415 --> 00:57:35,750
We Have A Chance
To Make It To Regionals.

1083
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:38,020
I Realize That.
I--I--

1084
00:57:38,052 --> 00:57:41,757
Ms. Bartlett,<I>
Si, Se Puede.

1085
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,359
What's That?

1086
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:45,493
It's Our Team Chant.

1087
00:57:45,527 --> 00:57:48,364
Marisol Taught It To Us
From Her Granny.

1088
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:49,398
<I>Si, Se Puede.

1089
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:51,266
It Means "Yes, I Can."

1090
00:57:54,469 --> 00:57:56,504
<I>Si, Se Puede.

1091
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:59,407
<I>Si, Se Puede.

1092
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,676
The Truth,
Mr. And Mrs. Cortez,

1093
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,078
Is That The Girls
Made Some Definite

1094
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,378
Errors In Judgment.

1095
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:05,781
But I Made
An Even Bigger One.

1096
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:08,116
I Didn't Show Nearly As Much Faith In Them

1097
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,485
As They Deserve.

1098
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,523
Well, We Appreciate You
Coming To Talk To Us Like This.

1099
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:16,224
Well, Alyssa's
A Terrific Girl.

1100
00:58:16,257 --> 00:58:17,225
And I Think
The Dance Team's

1101
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:18,494
Been Really Good
For Her.

1102
00:58:20,596 --> 00:58:22,965
For The First Time,
She Not Only Has Books,

1103
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:24,266
She Has Friends.

1104
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:26,569
Oh, That's Great.

1105
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:29,571
So, How Do You Think We Should Tell Mr. Zavala

1106
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:32,373
About This
Little Incident?

1107
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:34,442
He's A Busy Man.

1108
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:36,779
He Has Enough
To Be Worried About.

1109
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,080
Thank You.

1110
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:39,647
I Promise
From Here On Out,

1111
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:41,383
I Will Be With The Girls
Every Step Of The Way.

1112
00:58:41,415 --> 00:58:43,418
Every School Rule
Will Be Followed.

1113
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,886
<I>Gracias, Ms. Bartlett.

1114
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,389
No, Really,
Thank You.

1115
00:58:47,422 --> 00:58:49,492
Thanks.

1116
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:50,493
So We're Still On?

1117
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:51,527
We Can Compete Again?

From Your Tribes
And Send Them Down Front.

1125
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:18,320

00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:19,789

Don't Look Now,
But You Might Actually Be Getting Good At This.

1164
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:36,331
[Laughs] Well,
I Found It Works Better

1165
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,200
If You Let Them Be
A Little Hands-On.

1166
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:41,369
So How's The Dance Team Practice Going?

1167
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:44,239
Great! The Girls Are
Really Working Hard.

1168
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,411
Ms. Bartlett: Ok.
That's It For Today.

1169
01:00:50,612 --> 01:00:52,047
[Sighs]

1170
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,516
Hey, You Wanted
To See Me?

1171
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:55,717
Daisy...

1172
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,552
How Come You Didn't
Tell Me You Had An Offer

1173
01:00:57,585 --> 01:00:59,487
From Lynell Elliot?

1174
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:03,591
Oh, Come On!
The High School Of The Performing Arts.

1175
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,694
That's The Most
Incredible Place!

1176
01:01:05,726 --> 01:01:08,364
Yeah.
It's Also A Zillion Miles Across Town.

1177
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:11,065
So?

1178
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:11,065
So, It's Probably A Bunch Of Stuck-Up Rich Kids

1179
01:01:11,098 --> 01:01:13,301
With Mommies And Daddies In Show Business.

1180
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:14,302
How Am I Supposed
To Fit In?

1181
01:01:14,335 --> 01:01:15,638
What Happened
To <I>"Si, Se Puede"?

1182
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,205
[Laughs]

1183
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,474
Please.

1184
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:20,242
Chuy Thinks
It's A Stupid Idea.

1185
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:21,543
Chuy...

1186
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:22,478
Hmm.

1187
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:23,712
Is He The Boyfriend?

1188
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:25,413
Yeah.

1189
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:26,882
Plus, He's Bent
At Me Enough

1190
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:28,918
For Spending So Much Time With Dance,

1191
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:29,985
You Know?

1192
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,253
And He Thinks
I'm Being Set Up

1193
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:32,488
For Something I Can Never Achieve.

1194
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,821
Hmm...

1195
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:36,492
What Grade
Is This Chuy In?

1196
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:37,726
None.
He Dropped Out.

1197
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:40,829
He's A Mechanic
Over At Escobar's.

1198
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:44,133
Which Pretty Much Means His
Future's Been Decided For Him.

1199
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:46,301
Is That What You Want?

1200
01:01:48,536 --> 01:01:49,772
Daisy...

1201
01:01:49,804 --> 01:01:52,407
Listen, Take It From Somebody Who Has Been There.

1202
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,641
This Is The Time
In Your Life

1203
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:55,677
When You Should Be
Seizing Every Opportunity,

1204
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,812
Following Your Dream.

1205
01:01:57,846 --> 01:02:00,181
Don't Make The Same Mistake I Did, Ok?

1206
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:14,797
[Screaming Joyfully]

1207
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,931
We Did It!
We Did It!

1208
01:02:15,964 --> 01:02:17,666
We Came In Second!

1209
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:19,101
We're Going
To Regionals!

1210
01:02:19,134 --> 01:02:20,336
Ohh!

1211
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:22,603
We're Going All The Way
To San Diego!

1212
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:24,539
All Praise
Ms. Bartlett!

1213
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:26,607
Hail
Ms. Bartlett!

1214
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:28,510
Thank You, Ladies.
I Will See You On Monday,

1215
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:30,980
And Then--We Are On
To Regionals!

1216
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,214
All: Yay!

1217
01:02:40,855 --> 01:02:41,991
What?

1218
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:44,893
Regionals?

1219
01:02:44,926 --> 01:02:46,395
Does That Mean This Thing Isn't Over Yet?

1220
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:49,031
It Would Have Been If We Hadn't Placed Today.

1221
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:50,531
But You Did.

1222
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:51,633
Yeah!

1223
01:02:51,665 --> 01:02:53,501
Don't Sound
So Excited For Us.

1224
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:55,571
I'm Gettin' Really Sick Of This, Girl.

1225
01:02:56,538 --> 01:02:57,706
Oh, Yeah?

1226
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:59,942
You Never Have Any Time For Me Anymore!

1227
01:02:59,974 --> 01:03:02,011
You're Always Dancing
Or Practicing

1228
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:03,679
Or Too Busy
Or Too Tired!

1229
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:06,348
Chuy, Why Can't
You Understand?

1230
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,149
Dance Is Finally
Giving Me A Chance

1231
01:03:08,183 --> 01:03:09,418
To Do Something
With My Life!

1232
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:11,153
What About Our Life?

1233
01:03:11,185 --> 01:03:12,553
What About
All Our Plans?

1234
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:13,688
I'm Just A Kid!

1235
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:15,690
I Don't Wanna
Be All Settled!

1236
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:17,426
You Know, Who Knows
What's Gonna Happen?

1237
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:18,726
I Know!

1238
01:03:18,759 --> 01:03:21,229
You're Gonna Go To That Snotnose Actors School.

1239
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:22,598
They're Gonna Chew You Up And Spit You Out,

1240
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,333
And You're Gonna Come Limping Back Expecting Me

1241
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,400
To Be Waitin'
Here For You?

1242
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:27,069
Well, You Know What?
Bag That,

1243
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:28,369
'Cause I Have
A Life, Too,

1244
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:29,705
And If You Don't
Wanna Be A Part Of It,

1245
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:31,540
Then You're
Out Of It!

1246
01:03:33,474 --> 01:03:35,110
Chuy, Wait!

1247
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:41,917
You Know What
Ms. Bartlett Told Me?

1248
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:43,785
She Said That Ever Since
She Quit Juilliard,

1249
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:46,054
She Wondered Every Day
What Would've Happened

1250
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:48,223
If She Stuck It Out.

1251
01:03:48,255 --> 01:03:51,359
Every Day,
She Wonders, Chuy!

1252
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:53,529
I Don't Wanna Wonder!
I Wanna Know!

1253
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:55,563
Well, Good For You.

1254
01:03:55,596 --> 01:03:57,632
<I>Buena Suerte,
Chica. Â¿Eh?

1255
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,538
Chuy, Don't Do This!

1256
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:04,572
[Tires Screech]

1257
01:04:33,701 --> 01:04:34,936
Answering Machine:
This Is Lynell Elliot.

1258
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:36,404
Please Leave A Message
After The Beep.

1259
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:37,739
[Beeps]

1260
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:39,474
Hi.

1261
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:41,909
Miss Elliot?

1262
01:04:41,942 --> 01:04:46,013
This Is Daisy Salinas
From Marshall Middle School.

1263
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:50,018
I Met You At
The Hamilton Dance Meet.

1264
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:53,489
I'm Calling Because I Would Very Much Appreciate It

1265
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,458
If You Would Send Me An Application To Your School.

1266
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:57,726
Thanks.

1267
01:05:01,395 --> 01:05:03,398
[Crying]

1268
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:09,003
What Do You Mean
We Can't Go?

1269
01:05:09,036 --> 01:05:11,139
I Mean,
This Is Everything Those Girls Have Worked For.

1270
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:12,940
I Understand,
But There's Not A Single Dime

1271
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:13,975
Left In The Budget.

1272
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:16,177
Well, What Are We
Talking About, A Bus?

1273
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,612
One Bus For One Day?

1274
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:19,547
How Much Could That
Possibly Cost?

1275
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:21,116
Because We'd Be Going
To San Diego,

1276
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:22,183
Which Is Outside
Our District,

1277
01:05:22,217 --> 01:05:23,819
I Have To Get
A Liability Rider.

1278
01:05:23,851 --> 01:05:26,522
Then There's The Cost Of The Driver,
The Gas, The Bus Itself--

1279
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:28,389
But This Isn't The First Year You've Had A Dance Team.

1280
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:30,158
Why Wasn't This Put In The Budget From The Start?

1281
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,793
But This Is The First Year We've Had A Dance Team

1282
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:33,362
That's Even Come Close To Being In The Regionals.

1283
01:05:33,395 --> 01:05:35,163
Sir, What Am
I Supposed To Do?

1284
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,965
Punish These Girls
For Their Success,

1285
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:39,134
Tell Them If They'd
Only Gone And Failed,

1286
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,369
Everything
Would Be Fine?

1287
01:05:40,402 --> 01:05:42,137
I'm Very Sorry, Ms. Bartlett,
But I Don't Know

1288
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:44,740
Where I'm Gonna Get
My Hands On $1,200.

1289
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:47,543
Ohh. [Sighs]

1290
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,810
What If We Raise
The Money Ourselves?

1291
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:51,513
Yeah. Maybe We Could Even Raise
Enough To Get New Uniforms.

1292
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:52,714
We Could
Have A Car Wash.

1293
01:05:52,746 --> 01:05:55,750
Yeah. And We Can Sell Food And Stuff.
Like A Block Party!

1294
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,753
Guys, We Have To Do Whatever
It Takes To Get To Regionals.

1295
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:00,489
We Have A Lot To Do
In The Next 2 Weeks.

1296
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:02,224
Like Come Up With
A Whole New Routine.

1297
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:03,926
Actually, You Guys,
I Was Thinking About That.

1298
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:06,494
How Would You Feel If We Did
Something Really Innovative

1299
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:08,529
By Taking Advantage
Of Your Background?

1300
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:10,599
You Mean,
Something Like This?

1301
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:12,834
I Did It Since I Was
Old Enough To Walk.

1302
01:06:12,866 --> 01:06:14,835
My Mother Call It<I>
La Lavadora.

1303
01:06:14,868 --> 01:06:16,404
The Washing Machine.

1304
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:19,441
Yeah! A-And How 'Bout The Merengue,
Like This?

1305
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,512
That's Perfect!
That's It!

1306
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:24,413
That's It!
Who Else?

1307
01:06:24,446 --> 01:06:25,581
Anybody Else
Have Something?

1308
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,449
My Parents Do The Cha-Cha.
It's Like...

1309
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:31,520
â™ª Cha-Cha-Cha â™ª

1310
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:32,520
Ms. Bartlett:
Ok, Watch Daisy.

1311
01:06:32,554 --> 01:06:33,789
Do You See How
She Makes It Her Own?

1312
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:36,692
She's Going From Cha-Cha
To Hip-Hop, Back To Salsa...

1313
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:38,125
Flamenco...

1314
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:39,427
Mmm...

1315
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,929
Unh... Salsa.

1316
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:45,234
Cool. Now, How Do We
Turn It Into A Routine?

1317
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:47,535
Yeah, And How Are We Ever
Gonna Learn It On Time?

1318
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:48,536
Well, Let's
Figure That Out.

1319
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:49,537
Daisy,
What Do You Think?

1320
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:50,538
We Start Up Here,

1321
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:52,241
Bring It Down...

1322
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:53,275
And Hip,

1323
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:54,443
Salsa,

1324
01:06:54,476 --> 01:06:55,477
Pirouette...

1325
01:06:55,509 --> 01:06:57,245
Come On, Girls,
Try This With Us.

1326
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,380
Merengue...

1327
01:06:58,413 --> 01:06:59,815
And Do What You Were
Doing Before, Ok?

1328
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:00,815
And Cross Over.

1329
01:07:00,848 --> 01:07:01,917
Ok, Perfect.

1330
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:03,317
Spin Around, And...

1331
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:04,553
Shake, Shake, Shake!

1332
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:05,753
From The Top--Up!

1333
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:07,822
Arms Up, Bring It Down,

1334
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:10,391
And Pop
The Head--Salsa...

1335
01:07:10,424 --> 01:07:11,659
Pirouette...

1336
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:17,299
Oh! Alex!

1337
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:18,766
What Are You Doing Here?

1338
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,068
I Have To Tell You,
You Are Not The Easiest Person

1339
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:22,170
In The World
To Track Down.

1340
01:07:22,203 --> 01:07:24,139
Ohh! Come Here!

1341
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:25,641
Let's Go Inside.

1342
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:25,641
Ok.

1343
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,109
Get Some Tea.

1344
01:07:28,143 --> 01:07:30,579
Are The Rumors True?
Are You Teaching Now?

1345
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:32,080
Ninth-Grade Biology.

1346
01:07:32,112 --> 01:07:33,681
[Laughs]
Unbelievable!

1347
01:07:33,714 --> 01:07:34,949
And You're
Digging It?

1348
01:07:34,982 --> 01:07:38,419
Yeah. It Definitely
Has Its Challenges.

1349
01:07:38,453 --> 01:07:40,455
Well, You Know,
The Reason I'm Here--

1350
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:42,357
I Was, Uh, Talking
To Bob Humphrey.

1351
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:43,991
From Medico?

1352
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:43,991
Exactly.

1353
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:46,360
He's Now One Of The Hotshots On The Web.

1354
01:07:46,393 --> 01:07:48,362
His Web Site--
It's Huge!

1355
01:07:48,395 --> 01:07:51,032
It's Gossip, Advice,
Fashion Tips--

1356
01:07:51,065 --> 01:07:53,435
You Know, All The Stuff
For Preteen Girls

1357
01:07:53,467 --> 01:07:55,170
With Links To The Best Clothes, Cosmetic,

1358
01:07:55,203 --> 01:07:57,339
And Music Sites.
It's Unreal!

1359
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:58,540
And?

1360
01:07:58,572 --> 01:07:59,641
And They're
Looking For A Head

1361
01:07:59,674 --> 01:08:01,342
Of Customer Relations
And Marketing...

1362
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:04,345
Hmm.

1363
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:04,345
And I Told Them
About You.

1364
01:08:04,378 --> 01:08:05,547
Oh...

1365
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:08,449
Well, Alex, That's
Really Flattering, But...

1366
01:08:08,482 --> 01:08:10,685
I Think I'm Starting To Hit My
Stride With This Teaching Thing.

1367
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,887
How Much You Making?

1368
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,355
Enough.

1369
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:17,025
If I Never Wanna Take Another Decent Vacation Again.

1370
01:08:17,058 --> 01:08:17,993
Hey, Whatever
You're Pulling In,

1371
01:08:18,025 --> 01:08:19,994
Bobby'll
Double It--At Least!

1372
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:21,396
I Mean, He's Had
A Hundred Applicants,

1373
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:23,364
But No One With Your Skills Or Experience.

1374
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:26,134
Now With This Teaching Thing On Top Of It...

1375
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:28,969
Your Students Are
His Core Demographic.

1376
01:08:29,002 --> 01:08:30,471
I Don't Know, Alex.

1377
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:31,540
I Don't Know.

1378
01:08:31,573 --> 01:08:32,741
Give Him A Call.

1379
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:34,376
They Even Have
An Office In London.

1380
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:36,844
Hmm...

1381
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:36,844
Ahh, You'd Love
London.

1382
01:08:39,046 --> 01:08:40,081
Give Him A Call.

1383
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:42,451
Take An Interview.
What Can It Hurt?

1384
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:46,487
I Guess There's No Reason Not To Just Meet The Guy.

1385
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,589
Exactly.

1386
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,858
Right...

1387
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,292
Give Him A Call.

1388
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:55,831
Alyssa: How Can You
Be Failing Math?

1389
01:08:55,863 --> 01:08:57,765
It's Only The Term
Progress Report,

1390
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,835
Not An Actual
Report Card.

1391
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:02,603
Look, Mr. Zavala Is Totally Crazy About This Stuff.

1392
01:09:02,636 --> 01:09:05,172
Any Failing Grade Means You Can't
Be On An After-School Team.

1393
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:06,942
Yeah, But Even <I>He Wouldn't Kick Her Off

1394
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:08,377
Right Before
Regionals.

1395
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:09,411
Wanna Bet?

1396
01:09:09,443 --> 01:09:11,245
Stupid Math!

1397
01:09:11,278 --> 01:09:12,947
It's Always
Been A Pain!

1398
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,549
What Are
We Gonna Do?

1399
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:16,284
Well, Let's Just Talk To Ms. Bartlett.

1400
01:09:16,317 --> 01:09:18,185
I Mean,
Maybe She Can Pull Some Strings.

1401
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:20,522
<I>Chicas! Listen Up.
Bad News.

1402
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:22,023
What's Going On,
Marisol?

1403
01:09:22,055 --> 01:09:23,023
I Hear Ms. Bartlett
Talking

1404
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:24,525
On Her Cell Phone
About A New Job.

1405
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:25,860
That's Not Possible.

1406
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:27,529
Marisol, Are You
Sure You Heard That?

1407
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:30,799
<I>S!
I Know My English Will Not Be So Perfect,

1408
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,501
But My Ears,

Daisy, That's Not True, Ok?
I Don't Believe It!

1412
01:09:40,742 --> 01:09:42,377
Look, We Never Should Have Trusted Her!

1413

You're Wrong!
Ms. Bartlett Cares About Us--

1414
01:09:44,278 --> 01:09:45,246
A Lot!

1415
01:09:44,278 --> 01:09:45,246
Yeah, Right.

Here, Ok?

Anything.

This Can't
Be Happening!

1422
01:09:51,318 --> 01:09:53,455
Hello?

1423
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:55,056
So, Have You Come To Make Your Farewell Address

1424
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:56,056

1425
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,159

A Job Interview.

Confirm It.

Is It True?
Are You Leaving?

01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,667
You Can't!
What About Regionals?

1431
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:06,902
So, Did They Offer
You A Lot Of Money

1432
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:09,170
And Tell You That
You Were The Best?

1433
01:10:09,203 --> 01:10:11,439
Actually, It Was An Extremely Generous Offer,

1434
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,507
And They Asked Me
To Start On Monday.

1435
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:15,510
Bye. We're Really
Gonna Miss You.

1436
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:16,911
How Could You
Do This To Us?

1437
01:10:16,944 --> 01:10:18,279
I Thought We Mattered To You.

1438
01:10:18,313 --> 01:10:20,449
Mr. Zavala Won't Let Us Go Anywhere Near Regionals

Can I Get A Word In?

01:10:25,353 --> 01:10:26,822
Why Bother?

1444
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:30,591
Actually, The Truth Is,

1445
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,795
I Turned Them Down.

1446
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:37,900
You Really Did?

1447
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:43,171
So, You're Staying?

1448
01:10:43,203 --> 01:10:45,174

Ms. Bartlett: So...

1453

Are You Ready?
Are We Gonna Practice?

1454
01:10:57,885 --> 01:10:59,888
Um, Actually?

1455
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:01,590
We've Got Another
Problem To Figure Out.

1456
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:07,229
Well, What If We Considered This One,
Big Extra-Credit Project?

1457
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:09,997
Yolanda Can Collect All The Money
Tomorrow At The Car Wash,

1458
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:11,500
And I'll Check
Her Calculations.

1459
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:12,567
If She Gets It Right,

1460
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,169
Then You Can Talk
To Her Math Teacher,

1461
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:15,904
See If He'll Raise
Her Grade To A "D."

1462
01:11:15,936 --> 01:11:17,506
That Could Work.

1463
01:11:17,538 --> 01:11:19,707
But You Have To Get Her
To Take It Very Seriously.

1464
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:22,243
If Yolanda Doesn't Deliver An Accurate Tabulation,

1465
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:23,811
She's Off
The Dance Team.

1466

So How Are We Doing?

1478
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:34,815

It's The Counting

1479
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:37,452
And Adding That'll
Be The Tricky Part.
