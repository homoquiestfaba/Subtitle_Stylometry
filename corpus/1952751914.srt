00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,728
Why don't you tell me?

885
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:03,027
Why? Why would someone
embrace something

886
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,034
that they are so opposed to?

887
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,594
Unless it's strategy.

888
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,197
Fight fire with fire.

889
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,209
[Stammering]

890
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,212
That doesn't make sense.
That doesn't make any sense to me.

891
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,772
Look, I mean, look at all the good
that technology has done.

892
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:24,411
Breakthroughs in medicine,
instant communication all over the globe.

893
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,819
- Detective, you don't get it, do you?
- Helps save innocent lives.

894
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,720
They don't like technology.

895
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,557
It doesn't matter about
the result or the application.

896
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,097
They don't like technology.

897
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,257
That's it.
Please, do me a favor.

898
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,598
Allow me to take these photos
for a couple of days.

899
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,638
You know, I got one plaque
in my whole life,

900
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,263
and they spelled my name wrong.

901
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,467
Two G's, not one.

902
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,506
Hey, Michael, it's Jess.

903
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,914
I've been doing some research
on the chain letters.

904
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,179
Call me back when you get this.
I'm headed home now.

905
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,723
[Beeping]

906
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,938
How can someone do this?

907
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,153
Someone's tracking us.

908
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:22,601
[Beeps]

909
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,934
[beeping]

910
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,505
[line ringing]

911
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,914
[ringing continues]

912
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,776
[voices overlapping]

913
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,459
[Man]
Huh? Huh?

914
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,520
[Phone ringing]

915
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,151
[voices overlapping continues]

916
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,811
Hey.

917
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,851
[Muttering]

918
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,411
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

919
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,548
How do you think I'm doing?

920
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:01,192
- I miss her, too, Neil.
- Yeah.

921
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,198
Yeah.

922
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,893
So, uh--
[stammering]

923
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,765
You wanna tell me what
this meeting is about, guys?

924
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,829
I mean, you're not gonna stop
any of these killings, Jessie.

925
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,899
You send out five chain letters,
and then five pop up everywhere.

926
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,069
I know. I know.
Just listen to me, okay?

927
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:18,670
There's a person behind this,
and I think I know what he's doing.

928
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,182
- He's tracking us online.
- Tracking us how?

929
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,946
There's a virus that I found
in my phone and in the e-mail, okay?

930
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,954
The virus is a tracker.
We all have it.

931
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,217
That's how he knows whether
or not we pass it on.

932
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,691
That's fucking crazy.
How could he know where we live? How?

933
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,627
It's easy, okay? Everything you have
is connected to a bill you pay, right?

934
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,755
And all the companies who bill you
have your addresses.

935
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,093
It's not that hard.

936
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,100
I never even thought about that.

937
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,796
But why us, huh?
Why us out of everybody?

938
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,101
Because he's a fucking
psychopath, Michael!

939
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,107
Why did Jeffrey Dahmer kill people?

940
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,302
- Why did O.J. slash his wife?
- What are you saying?

941
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,777
- What do you think I'm saying?
- Guys, come on. Stop.

942
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,973
No. This is not
on you guys, all right?

943
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,574
- Who do you think got the first message?
- Who did he send it to then?

944
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,881
Me. He sent me
the message, all right?

945
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,478
I-- He said it was a game.

946
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,080
And I sent it to you guys.
You know how that feels?

947
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,217
You wanna know what that--
Fuck it. All right.

948
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,488
- I'll show you what that fucking feels like.
- What are you doing?

949
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:08,792
- Neil, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna show you.

950
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:11,128
I'm gonna fucking show you what it's like
to be in my fucking shoes.

951
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,565
What the fuck are you doing?

952
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,398
What are you doing?
Give me your phone.

953
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,233
- [Beeping]
- I sent you the message.

954
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,830
- You got it.
- [Ringing]

955
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,173
- [chimes]
- [muffled crying]

956
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,643
All right. It's fine.

957
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,710
You fucking shit.

958
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,788
[All yelling]

959
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,984
- Stop!
- Stop!

960
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,289
- You threaten my life?
- This isn't on you!

961
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:42,092
This is on me, all right?
This is on me!

962
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:45,099
Everybody's fucking dead,
and you pull a fucking gun out on us?

963
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,158
[Phone chimes]

964
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,840
- Oh, fuck.
- [Michael] What?

965
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,002
- He fucking sent me another chain letter.
- What?

966
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:59,570
Fucking break the chain,
and you will die, man.

967
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,881
Man, he's watching us.
He is watching us.

968
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,353
Fuck you, Neil.
What are you saying? Where is he?

969
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,323
- He's here. He's watching us.
- We gotta do something now.

970
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,225
Okay, so the way this works
is you die if you delete it, right?

971
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,388
The chain letter said
we had 24 hours.

972
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,694
I don't wanna die.

973
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,895
I'm just gonna send the fucking message
to people that I hate, right?

974
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,904
I mean, if they die,
big fucking deal.

975
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,667
- Too bad for them.
- You're fucking tripping right now.

976
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,004
- Just chill out for a second.
- Hey, I sent the message to you,

977
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,907
didn't l?

978
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,037
Fuck you guys, man.
I'm fucking outta here.

979
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,209
So listen to me. I know how
we can pass these on, okay?

980
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,753
And then once it's over,
we just have to get rid of our phones

981
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,220
and our e-mail addresses, okay?

982
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,587
Whatever.
[Scoffs]

983
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,718
What the fuck
does it matter now, huh?

984
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,658
[Sniffles]

985
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,400
[computer chimes]
You've received chain mail.

986
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,410
Why the fuck do you keep
sending these to me, man?

987
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,181
I'm doing everything you want me to do.
I keep sending them on.

988
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:14,987
Fucker!

989
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:22,453
[Chimes]
You've received chain mail.

990
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,022
What the fuck
you want me to do?

991
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,797
I've sent off these goddamn chain letters
to everyone I fucking know.

992
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,394
[Stammering]

993
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,235
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.

994
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:34,140
Fucking relax, man.
I just gotta take...

995
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,974
I gotta take a deep
fucking breath.

996
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,604
[Exhales forcefully]

997
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,273
I just gotta think
what I'm gonna do.

998
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,375
[Chimes]
You've received chain mail.

999
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,979
Fucking Rachael.

1000
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:50,321
[Mutters]

1001
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:51,950
[chimes]
You've received chain mail.

1002
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,621
[Sighs]
All right.

1003
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,962
[Stammering]
I gotta fucking--

1004
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:01,093
- You've received chain mail.
- I gotta fucking do something.

1005
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,797
- I gotta fucking do something.
- You've received chain mail.

1006
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,464
He wants to fucking
play games with me.

1007
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,405
That's what he fucking
wants to do, huh?

1008
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,942
- [Computer continues]
- You wanna fucking play games?

1009
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,944
You wanna fucking
play games with me!

1010
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,480
- Kill my goddamn sister!
- You've received chain mail.

1011
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:14,778
- Fucking delete this.
- [Beeps]

1012
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,650
Delete your fucking message, man.
Why don't you come and get me?

1013
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,417
Why don't you fucking
come and get me?

1014
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,152
[Grunts]

1015
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,818

1017
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,595
[screaming]

1018
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:32,592
[screaming continues]

1019
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,474
[yelling]

1020
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,171
[screaming]

1021
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,794
[phone ringing]

1022
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,626
[gasping]

1023
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,689
[ringing continues]

1024
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,807
- Jessie, what's going on?
- Just forward me the chain letter.

1025
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,208
Forward it to me,
and then change your number.

1026
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:19,076
Change your e-mail address,
and never use those old accounts again.

1027
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:21,343
Crenshaw has it set up so that
all the e-mails are going

1028
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,317
to some police computer
that tracks them.

1029
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,977
I don't feel good about this.
If it doesn't work,

1030
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,419
everything's gonna fall on you.

1031
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,046
Just trust me, okay?
Just send it.

1032
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,318
I'll be fine. I'll be okay.
Just send it.

1033
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,189
[Sighs]

1034
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:35,424

1036
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,328
Crenshaw.

1037
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,396
[Mr. Bradford]
Remember that link you were looking for?

1038
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,408
Oh, Mr. Bradford.

1039
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,501
I remembered.

1040
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:53,742
Used to be a place
out on Ramsey Road.

1041
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,250
Wilson. Dead now.

1042
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:59,947
One of his sons
went off to that war.

1043
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,616
Used to supply chains
to the meatpacking plant.

1044
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,250
Plant went out of business.

1045
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,761
So did they.

1046
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,581
[Thinking]
"They brand themselves with bar codes."

1047
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,210
Oh, my God.

1048
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,448
[Beeping]

1049
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,888
- [line ringing]
- Come on. Pick up.

1050
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,791
Crenshaw. Oh, shoot.

1051
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,795
Crenshaw, I know these are our guys.

1052

they dropped out of sight.

They brand themselves
with bar codes

1057

destroys individual identity.

Crenshaw,
where have you been?

turned out to be an imposter.

You're not gonna believe this,
but the actual Wiggins

1086
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,124
turned up deceased
less than an hour ago.
