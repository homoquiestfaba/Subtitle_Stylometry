1
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,695
 This is our Ouija board, okay.

2
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,363
        Rule number one-
      there's three of 'em.

3
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,366
 Number one, never ask a spirit
          how it died.

4
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,035
        Rule number two,

5
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,203
     don't ever ask a spirit
      how you're gonna die.

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,607
      Last rule, you never,
      ever leave the board

7
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,575
     without saying goodbye.

8
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,285
       This is a bad idea.

9
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,793
  Why don't you show yourself?
              Huh?

10
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,529
            B D R M.
     It's short for bedroom.

11
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,773
   How did we possibly forget
         to say goodbye?

12
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,375
      It's the first rule.

13
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,678
      LyNette, is that you?

14
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,616
       Get the damn camera
         out of my face!

15
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,219
       I don't understand.
       - It was the board.

16
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,696
     I don't need no little,
       weird spirit ghost

17
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,432
    runnin' around my house.

18
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,303
        Hey, who in here?

19
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,272
       Shane, is that you?

20
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,552
          Some believe
      that certain spirits

21
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,589
       remain on our plane
     and contact the living

22
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,325
   for the purpose of relaying
        certain messages.

23
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,327
 Those messages usually pertain

24
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:12,197
     to unresolved conflicts
           or issues.

25
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,477
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,185
All right, all right.
           Okay wait.

27
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:36,421
One, two, three, go.

28
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,303
          Where is it?

29
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,772
        It's right here.
     Do I just throw it in?

30
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,240
             - Yes!
             - Okay!

31
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,253
       Hey, good-lookin'.

32
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,322
      How you doin' today?

33
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,725
LyNette.

34
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,661
           Oh, Jesus.

35
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,433
            Holy sh--

36
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,436
   What the fuck is goin' on?

37
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,611
        What's goin' on?

38
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,219
               No.

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,944
      Well, my name is Ty,
    I am the theater manager

40
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,980
           and we have
   a special surprise for you

41
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,615
    here at the Ritz Theater.

42
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,784
         We have some of
 the cast members here with us.

43
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:16,488
Come up here, guys!

44
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,965
   So, how is everybody doing?

45
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,800
           Doing good?
           Doing good?

46
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,603
        All right, guys,
   my name is Justin Armstrong

47
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,473
      and I played Michael
    in<i> The Ouija Experiment</i> .

48
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,611
    Yo, what's up, everybody?

49
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,880
     My name is Eric Wendell
          and I played

50
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:47,352
C to the A, to the L,
          to the V I N,

51
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,755
             Calvin.

52
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,758
         Enough of that.

53
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,926
          Hi, everyone,
      my name is Swisyzinna

54
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,529
      and I played LyNette
          in the movie.

55
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,298
         Mm-hmm. Right.

56
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,402
     And I think that I can
       speak for all of us

57
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:07,372
   when I say a big thank you
 to the historical Ritz Theater

58
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,408
  for bein' such gracious hosts
              to us

59
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,543
         for premiering
     <i> The Ouija Experiment</i> ,

60
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,646
       and to Ty, you are
      a great host as well,

61
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,417
        and to all of you
     for being amazing fans.

62
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,619
       Thank you so much.
      Give yourself a hand.

63
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,555
        We love you all.
           Thank you.

64
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,726
    Anyone have any questions
     for any of the actors?

65
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,563
              Yeah.
      What's your question?

66
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,072
        I was wondering,
        uh, if... Zina...

67
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,941
   Zinna, it's Zinna, sweetie.

68
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,509
           Sorry, um.

69
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,746
   I was wondering if Zinna...

70
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,355
    Can you please speak up?
             Thanks.

71
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,827
Sorry, I was wondering
   if you were actually scared

72
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,396
          when you were
      shooting your scenes?

73
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,099
       You looked like you
       were really scared.

74
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,967
       Was that for real?

75
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,969
Yes, I was scared for real.

76
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,138
   That was not acting, okay?

77
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,108
        Zinna and LyNette
    are the same exact person

78
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,077
when it comes to that...

79
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,749
Thank you, thank you.

80
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,053
          Anyone else?

81
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,055
              Yeah?

82
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,959
       I was wondering if
       all of the stories

83
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,862
        about the theater
    being haunted were true.

84
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,631
- What do you mean exactly?
-  Did she say haunted?

85
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,868
This theater really
         isn't haunted.

86
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,938
   the story about the family
  who used to own the theater.

87
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,741
         They had a baby
    that was born a monster,

88
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,879
 and it fed upon humans as food?

89
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,616
   They say you can still hear
    its ghost after midnight,

90
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,751
   wandering around in chains,

91
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,987
      growling and moaning,

92
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,624
   looking to feed again upon
   unsuspecting theater-goers

93
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,460
      in these very aisles,

94
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,896
 not having a clue of the horror

95
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,165
          that could be
       in store for them.

96
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,699
            Boo! Oh!

97
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,104
Please welcome our monster
         of the evening,

98
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,473
      and your horror host
       for tomorrow night,

99
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,475
           Danny Gray!

100
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,746
         Hi, everybody!
    Welcome to Ouija Ouikend!

101
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:33,652
      I'm Danny and this is
  our lovely assistant, Elena.

102
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:37,823
      Okay, so, the scares
    do not just end tonight.

103
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,859
    Tomorrow we'll be having
         a haunted tour

104
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,994
      of the Ritz Theater.

105
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,897
    Now, you may wonder, hmm,

106
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,933
    do we have anything else
            in store?

107
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,067
           Yes we do.

108
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,737
       We placed a flyer-
         a winning flyer

109
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,006
  underneath one of your seats.

110
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,910
      So check now and see
      if you are a winner!

111
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,545
          Huh? Anybody?
           - I got it!

112
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,681
             - Hey!
       - What's your name?

113
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,650
          I'm Michelle.
  - Congratulations, Michelle.

114
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,788
   Michelle, you have just won
        two tickets extra

115
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,224
 for the overnight fright tour!

116
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,662
       You are going to be
     spending that night...

117
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,799
      ...with the cast from
     <i> The Ouija Experiment</i> !

118
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,705
    That night will be filled
          with chills,

119
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:30,175
     creepy noises, thrills,

120
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,179
         and, of course,
         bragging rights

121
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,982
    for you to tell everybody

122
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,918
     that you are the winner
        and they are not.

123
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,990
      All right everybody,
  there's tickets in the lobby

124
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,858
      for the haunted tour.

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,094
  I'll see everybody tomorrow.

126
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,272
   ...and you have a frightful
    Ouija Ouikend, everyone!

127
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,274
  Thank you so much for coming!

128
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,648
       So, you know you're
      going with me, right?

129
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,652
      I'd be kind of pissed
          if I wasn't,

130
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,921
          but who else
       are we gonna bring?

131
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,224
      Uh, I'm not sure yet.
      Um, who so you think?

132
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,294
         Um, let's see,
     we can maybe do Marcus.

133
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,930
       What about Tyrone?
          ooh, Israel.

134
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,899
        Ignacio. Ignacio.

135
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,002
     No, not another one of
   your two-day relationships.

136
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,771
    They're so cute, though.
       Like, really cute.

137
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,840
  Like, hella, totes, way cute.

138
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,242
 Okay, I'm gonna be right back.

139
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,116
               Hi.

140
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,820
      You're Margo, right?

141
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,121
            Uh, yeah.

142
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,124
  Um, I won the overnight thing
         tomorrow night,

143
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,126
        and I'm gonna go
      with my friend, Drew,

144
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,664
   and I was wondering if you
     wanted to come with us.

145
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,834
        Um, thanks, I'm-
     I'm all right, though.

146
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,102
           Thank you.

147
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,803
          Oh, why not ?

148
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,206
        Uh, just 'cause.

149
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,674
 I haven't lived here that long

150
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,243
     and I could really use
          a new friend.

151
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,848
 People think that I'm... weird.

152
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,282
         Well, who cares
        what they think.

153
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,818
   I don't think you're weird.

154
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,220
            Not yet.

155
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,855
     Sorry, what'd you say?

156
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,824
        Uh, nothing, uh.

157
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,028
   I can't go, but thank you.

158
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,199
           Um, Margo,

159
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,036
     you asked a really good
        question inside.

160
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,884
       Did you invite her?

161
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,919
    What's with the attitude?

162
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:31,189
       Yes, I invited her.
        She's not coming.

163
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,125
     You know, that might be
          for the best.

164
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,393
      Why do you say that?

165
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,829
    Uh, because she's weird.

166
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,267
   I dunno, she's like a total
      stoner, or something.

167
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,302
      She has these moments
        where she, like,

168
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,706
      completely zones out.

169
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,307
            I dunno,
     she's just kind of off.

170
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,210
       Well, Mr. Only Male
        in Home Ec class,

171
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,412
    people think you're weird
 and I still hang out with you.

172
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,047
            You know,
   that is totally different.

173
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,949
             - Why?
    - Because I'm totes fab.

174
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,318
  Ah, okay, let's get a pizza.

175
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,993
            Michelle.

176
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,729
            Oh, yeah?

177
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,397
     I'll go with you guys.

178
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,300
     Okay, see you tomorrow.

179
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,868
             See ya.

180
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,487
So, you and Justin can be here
       tomorrow at seven?

181
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,455
     Yeah, that sounds good.

182
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:41,226
       So, we'll be acting
         but not acting?

183
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,494
  I mean, we'll be improvising,
             right?

184
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,964
  but we're just gonna make it
 seem like it's really haunted,

185
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:50,502
   So, it the same outline and
   story from the post online?

186
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,004
    Yes, but hold on a second
            on that,

187
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,840
     because Danny's the one
   who knows all the details,

188
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,242
        and I think he's
        added some stuff.

189
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,977
      Let me check with him
       very quickly, okay?

190
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,378
          Okay, thanks.

191
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,981
Hell, Danny, you there?

192
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,383
     There is a story line?
    I did not get that email.

193
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,785
      Did you get an email?

194
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,520
     That's because it's not
        an actual email,

195
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,088
    it's on a group web page.

196
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,790
       There's a web page?

197
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,558
            Uh, yeah.

198
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,126
      The one that we were
        supposed to join

199
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,462
      so they could send us
      all the information?

200
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,098
       You didn't join it?

201
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,001
            Join it?
    Uh, Z, I never found it.

202
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,102
      I looked everywhere.

203
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,970
        I was on MySpace,
       I was on Facebook,

204
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,072
    I Grammed and Tweeted it,
        I InstaBooked it.

205
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,407
   I looked everywhere for it,
              okay?

206
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,277
          Ouija Weekend
       Wellington, Texas.

207
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,112
      I searched for hours.
        It doesn't exist.

208
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:38,850
  Uh, did you spell both words
           with O U I?

209
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,085
         Ouija Ouikend?

210
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,923
 You know, like those ghetto-ass
     shirts you just bought

211
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,558
     that say Ouija Ouikend?

212
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,992
    They're not that ghetto.

213
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,261
      - It's spray painted.
             - And?

214
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,063
          And leaking.

215
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,834
 Look, the studio gave you $500
        to make T-shirts

216
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,135
    and that's what you did?

217
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,102
  What'd you do with the money?

218
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,972
      Okay, you know, what?
  You're makin' this personal.

219
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,273
      This is not about me.

220
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,876
    I need you to just focus
        and move forward.

221
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,010
        Get it together.

222
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,313
         What matters is
        what do I do now?

223
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,381
     Uh, smart would tell me

224
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,984
   uh, that you should come in
   first thing in the morning

225
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,887
      and rehearse as much
           as you can.

226
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,324
  Look, you have a lot of lines
         with Eric too.

227
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,893
      Are you trying to get
    the studio top fire you?

228
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,962
           No, no, no.
        Okay, okay, okay.

229
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,631
 Do you think Eric would be open
      to rehearsing with me
     in the morning, early?

230
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,067
          I don't know.
           It's Eric.

231
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,903
       Speaking of which,
         where is Eric?

232
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,538
           Who knows?

233
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,035
         Sorry, it's me.

234
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,503
   Oh, my God, you scared me!

235
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,905
           Um, sorry.

236
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,940
    Ty told me that you guys
         wanted to know

237
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,141
  a little bit about tomorrow.

238
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,410
            He does.
        I'm headed home.

239
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,247
  Oh, and I- I have these props
      for you for tomorrow.

240
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,316
           Oh, sweet!
              Okay.

241
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,651
              Here.

242
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,453
         Oh, thank you.
       Oh, that's awesome.

243
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,489
      And which way is out?

244
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,691
 - Um, you know, just follow me.
             - Okay.

245
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:30,528
      Okay, so, the premise
   of everything is exactly--

246
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,430
         Wait a second.

247
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,499
         Both of you are
        on the home page?
         The group page?

248
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,134
             - Yes.
          - Of course.

249
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,504
  Okay, so, what's going on is
    we're changing things up.

250
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:42,006
    I don't want the normal,
            you know,
    where everybody is like,

251
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,410
 "Okay, let's go into this room
           and then--

252
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,945
               Ha!

253
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,646
  You know, I don't want that.
       I don't want that.

254
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,415
    We're gonna change it up.
       We're gonna make it
          even cooler.

255
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:54,152
      So, instead of going
        to the back room,

256
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,387
  or, no, actually, instead of
 going to the concession stand,

257
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,522
         we're gonna go
        to the back room.

258
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,556
             - Okay.
            - Got it.

259
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,159
              Yeah.
      No, wait, wait, wait.

260
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,661
       I have to know this
    before we go any further.

261
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,596
   What's your favorite part?

262
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,035
  Out of what I sent, you know,
   what's your favorite part?

263
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,104
         My- You want--
         My- Of course--

264
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,006
        - What's your...
             - Mine?

265
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,543
  - Justin, your favorite part.
             - Um...

266
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,412
      - From what he said.
      - From the home page?

267
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:25,683
 - So, I really liked that, uh-
  The one part when the guy...

268
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,585
          - Which part?
         - I'm tellin'.

269
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,721
        Um, when the guy,

270
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,724
  he's with those- those girls,
       and he scares them.

271
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,293
          You know what
       I'm talking' about.

272
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,261
       You're kidding me.

273
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,031
  That's my favorite part, too.

274
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,666
  You're gonna love this, then.
           - Awesome!

275
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,769
        this is actually-
 this is what you just gave me.

276
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,071
    It's called a ghost box.
            - Uh huh?

277
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,773
      You are shitting me.

278
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,648
Eric!

279
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,056
           Excuse me.

280
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,657
      Where have you been?

281
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,493
     I was over here talkin'
           to Selena.

282
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,494
             Elena.

283
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,596
    Elena, right, yes, Elena.

284
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:16,200
       Elena, meet Zinna,
        Justin and Danny.

285
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,568
        Hi, how ya doin'?

286
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,771
    Nice to meet you, Elena.

287
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,707
  Hey, listen I'm headed home,
              okay?

288
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,612
     I need you guys to know
          that we have
 a really big night tomorrow...

289
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:31,249
 ...and I want both of you guys
      to be there on time.

290
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,785
   Okay, Zinna, we'll be here.

291
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,754
           You got it.
       Whatever you need.

292
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,658
          Unbelievable.

293
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,597
If I remember right, this is
  supposed to be the basement.

294
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,433
Okay.

295
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,135
Hold on, it's a little--

296
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,471
  Okay, yeah, watch your step.

297
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,306
       It's a little funky
          right there.

298
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,643
 Watch your step over here, too.

299
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,378
All right.

300
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:05,483
Aw, man, this place is filthy!

301
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,753
Sorry, I thought you said
    you wanted it like that.

302
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,822
     No, leave it this way.

303
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,825
    Actually, you know what?
      What's gonna be great

304
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,593
 is we'll bring people in here,

305
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,428
     and this is where they
    have to stay over night.

306
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,264
      You know, they'll be
           over there.

307
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,234
    Heck, they can even sleep
           on the bed.

308
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:28,339
     we're just gonna scare
 the living bejesus out of 'em.

309
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,878
  Okay, so, I guess, you know,

310
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,279
      I'm getting a little
     hot and sticky in here,

311
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,583
   so I'm gonna take this off,
           and, uh...

312
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,485
              Okay.

313
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,359
  You're not like the character
     in the movie, are you?

314
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,660
        How do you mean?

315
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,898
  You know, like, a womanizer.
      A player, and stuff.

316
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,605
  Elena- see, I know your name.

317
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,740
         Look, trust me,
  it's just- it's just acting.

318
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,275
        I promise, baby.

319
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,811
      I'm nothing like that
          in real life.

320
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,180
  I'm a- I'm a big teddy bear.

321
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,849
        You know, gentle
         as a puppy dog.

322
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,420
             - Yeah?
             - Yeah.

323
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,762
      So what's in the bag?

324
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,265
          Hmm, I dunno.

325
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:31,302
      and some things Danny
   wanted for tomorrow night.

326
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,606
  Oh my God, is this the board
         from the movie?

327
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,608
        Yeah, I think so.

328
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,680
       No, I don't believe
    them things work at all.

329
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,384
       They're so creepy.

330
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,520
       Well, you know, uh,
      I believe it do work.

331
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,889
      Let me see this here.
         Let me find it.

332
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,859
           All right.
           Come here.

333
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,630
 So, you do know how this work,
             right?

334
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,898
           Not really.

335
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,601
     Okay, before we start,

336
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,636
    you gotta know the rules,
            remember?

337
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,939
       Like in the movie?
           - Exactly.

338
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:12,410
  Okay, the first rule is that
    you cannot ask the spirit

339
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,278
    how you're going to die.

340
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,880
         Okay, 'cause it
      could subconsciously-

341
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,382
    it could make it happen,
     and it could be crazy.

342
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,651
      And I don't want that
        to happen to you.

343
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,254
     Okay, rule number two,

344
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:27,358
    you never ask the spirit
          how it died.

345
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,827
 Oh, oh, right, because it might
         make them upset

346
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,462
     because they relive it,
      or something, right?

347
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,631
          Yes, and then
     the board'll freeze up

348
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,300
   and it won't work anymore.

349
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,669
 Now, you remember the last one,
             right?

350
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,906
  It's the most important one.

351
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,276
       Never stop playing
     without saying goodbye.

352
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,346
     Yeah, okay, so you were
     paying attention, huh?

353
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,948
           Okay, cool.

354
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,751
       So, can we try it?

355
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,388
            Why not?

356
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,590
          Yeah, I mean,
    you could sit next to me

357
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,860
     and protect me from all
    the mean spirits, right?

358
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,263
             Uuh...

359
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,465
         Well, since you
        put it that way,

360
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,501
          let's do it,
          but hold on.

361
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,807
        But, you know...

362
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,878
  ...I can thrill you more than
 any ghost would ever dare try.

363
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,415
Huh?

364
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,485
           All right,
   let's put our hands on it.

365
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,021
       Okay, I'm gonna put
         this one on it.

366
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,622
    Now, we gotta touch hands

367
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,624
   'cause that's the only way
        it's gonna work.

368
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,992
   I don't remember that part.

369
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,361
     Well, that's 'cause you
      wasn't in the movie.

370
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,829
              Okay?

371
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,798
        Is anybody there?

372
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,902
        Is anybody there?

373
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,573
        Is anybody there?
             Hello?

374
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,376
           Oh, my God.

375
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,781
           Well, see?
       What'd I tell you?

376
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,915
            It works.

377
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,784
 Let me ask the first question.

378
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,385
              Okay.

379
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,657
       Spirit, do I really

380
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,660
      like this lovely lady
   sittin' on the side of me?

381
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,062
     I mean, like, honestly.

382
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:14,432
       I'd be nothing but
   a perfect boyfriend, right?

383
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,070
        See, I told you.

384
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,339
 Now, why would the spirit lie?

385
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,807
     You're such a bastard.

386
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,674
             I know.

387
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,878
Elena!

388
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,350
    You're on theater hours.

389
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,885
             I know.
      Nothing was going on.

390
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,688
  I've been trying to close up
     for a few minutes now.

391
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,390
            Let's go.

392
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,460
        Okay, chill out.
           I'm coming.

393
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,897
         Hey, hey, hey.
    Did I get you in trouble?

394
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,066
      Oh, no, he likes me.

395
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:52,403
            Like you?
        What do you mean?

396
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,004
 We went out to dinner one time

397
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,907
  and I guess he's just kind of
 bitter that it didn't work out.

398
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,509
         Oh, that's it?

399
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,677
              Yeah.

400
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,912
      Wow, well, you know,

401
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,782
     an insecure boyfriend,
        or ex-boyfriend,

402
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:07,852
        or friend-friend
     in the picture with me

403
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,420
       is not a good mix.

404
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:13,557
      I mean, look at him,
      and then look at me.

405
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,427
Shut up.

406
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,597
       Come on, let's go.
        He's already mad.

407
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,795
            Perfect.

408
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,434
          Oh... shit...

409
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,969
         Oh, it's a bug.

410
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,672
        Where am I, Lord?

411
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,676
         What was that?

412
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,114
Okay.

413
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,688
          Oh, hell, no.

414
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,560
          Oh, hell, no.

415
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,129
       Did I just do that?

416
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,964
           I did that.

417
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,966
              Dang!

418
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,239
             Hello?

419
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,044
     I just dropped my keys
        down the stairs.

420
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,580
   Can someone get 'em for me?

421
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,816
             Hello?

422
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,122
           Hello, no.

423
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,824
              Dang!

424
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,003
            Dang it.

425
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,509
              Okay.

426
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,836
     Okay, get it together.

427
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,671
        You can do this.

428
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,778
         Really, Zinna?
             Really?

429
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,948
        Do you have to be
 the black girl that dies first
          in the movie?

430
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,787
 Ain't nobody got time for this.

431
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,673
Hey, um, I'm sorry
         about earlier.

432
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,042
 I really wasn't doing anything.

433
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,878
    Well, Elena, just because
          we're exes--

434
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,281
         We're not exes.

435
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,849
   What are you talking about?

436
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,085
     I mean, I took you out
      to a nice restaurant,

437
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,853
    I bought you decent food,
            you know.

438
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,089
   I was having a great time,
             I mean,

439
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,157
          weren't you?

440
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,095
   No, I was just being nice.

441
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,364
            Elena...

442
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,834
     ...I think I love you.

443
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,904
         Well, I don't.

444
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,942
             Hello?
       Is anyone up there?

445
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,216
     The theater is closed!

446
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,187
    The tour begins tomorrow!

447
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,871
               Ty?
          Are you here?

448
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,440
        I'm ready to go.

449
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,943
 You're not still mad, are you?

450
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,760
               Ty?
          Is that you?

451
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,473
Somebody help me! Please!

452
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,245
I ain't dyin' tonight.
    I die first in the movie.

453
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,613
     I mean, can't a brother
       survive somethin'?

454
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,515
       Dang, man, you know
        what I'm sayin'?

455
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,617
   I want- I want that ghost-
         I'm not joking,

456
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,954
     covered in blood, just,
        aah, rip me open.

457
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,456
   No, no, you can have that.

458
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,295
         What'd you do?

459
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,670
 Y'all both workin' that horror
 tour this evening, aren't you?

460
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:21,471
            Yes, sir.

461
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,206
           Well, uh...

462
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,476
         ...y'all better
        watch yourselves.

463
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,179
           Officer...

464
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,148
      ...I don't know what
      you're talking about.

465
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,360
             See...

466
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:46,596
       I don't appreciate
     any big city outsiders

467
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,067
    trying to bring evil into
  my peaceful little town here.

468
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:53,303
    I told you, I don't know
   what you're talkin' about.

469
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,238
        I'm telling' you
        about that movie,

470
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,975
     this haunted tour thing
    you've got here tonight.

471
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:02,579
      Yeah, it's just that
     this theater's haunted.

472
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,182
  Yeah, it's haunted for real.

473
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:09,653
        Now, I might not
      have believed it when
  I was a little bit younger...

474
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,655
 but bein' Sheriff in this town
       for so many years,

475
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,257
      I've seen some pretty
      crazy things go down.

476
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,695
     Inside that theater...

477
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,497
     ...there was a monster.

478
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,233
 And that monster killed people.

479
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,435
        He killed people,
      he like... ate 'em up

480
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,105
       and... he spit out
         all the bones.

481
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:31,341
   Look, now this here is just
          for fun, man.

482
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,610
          for the kids
    and promotin' our movie.

483
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,679
     Nothing else, Officer.

484
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,748
  Well, I understand all that,

485
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,317
        but when it comes
        to Ouija boards,

486
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,322
 and you don't know what they're
    capable of really doin'.

487
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,225
        I read about it.
           All right?

488
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,794
        I saw that movie
     of y'all's last night,

489
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,796
        and what was it,
      it was you that said

490
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,798
     that they could be used
         as a passageway

491
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,666
     between the ghost world
            and ours.

492
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:01,638
    Well, it was me, and with
  all due respect, sir, I mean,

493
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,073
       It's just a movie.

494
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,075
      I know it's a movie.
         I'm not stupid.

495
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,276
  I know it's fake, and stuff,

496
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:09,613
         but it's based
    on something that's real.

497
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,249
  Now these boards, they're not
     to be toyed around with

498
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:14,217
   like you're playin' a game
      of checkers and all.

499
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,719
        This is serious.

500
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,821
 And the fact that you're gonna
        have one in there

501
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,523
   you're gonna be playin' it,

502
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,558
   you're gonna be playin' it
   overnight in that theater,

503
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,361
   See, I don't- I don't think
          that's smart.

504
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,663
     You know, I just think
        that's a bad mix.

505
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,065
         You understand
      what I'm gettin' at?

506
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:33,537
Look, we'll be... super careful,
       all right, promise.

507
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,806
          Scouts honor.

508
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,611
     I'll be watchin' y'all
           tonight...

509
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:45,382
  ...and if anything gets outta
   hand, and I mean anything,

510
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:48,485
  especially after this meeting
          we just had,

511
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,620
        y'all gonna have
        me to deal with.

512
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,125
        Thanks, Sheriff.

513
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:58,195
        Yes, sir, master.
      Have a good day, sir.

514
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,396
             Crazy.

515
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,231
  That was- no, that was weird.

516
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,799
      That's what that was.

517
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,202
      He just wanted to win
       a pissing contest.

518
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,537
   I just say we just make him
          think he won.

519
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,639
      Whatever works, man.

520
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,212
        What time is it?

521
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,380
           It's 10:15.

522
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,748
          It's locked.

523
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,820
 We were supposed to meet, uh...
  that manager from yesterday.

524
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,256
       What was his name?
      - I don't know, man.

525
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,692
            Come on.

526
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:29,860
      Playin' around, man.

527
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,495
           Let us in.

528
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,166
       You guys like this?

529
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,734
      Hey, I made you one.

530
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,770
           - Oh, yeah.
   - You see the resemblance?

531
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,773
   And, now here's the thing,

532
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:49,479
     yours can be this or...
      this one right here.

533
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,815
            Look at--
    Oh, smile for me, smile.

534
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,283
        Ah, look, cheese!
           - That one.

535
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,219
      Yeah I like that one.
          Better teeth.

536
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,555
     You know, I'm sensitive
         about my teeth.

537
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:01,625
        Hey, oh, what was
         all that about?

538
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:06,730
 It was about some cop out there
    askin' us about tonight.

539
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:09,466
   He was being superstitious
        about something.

540
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,868
      That's not all he is.

541
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,538
        Wait, wait, wait,
        what do you mean?

542
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,606
       Okay, rumor has it,

543
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,575
            he, like,

544
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:22,445
   he, like, dated, like, his
  sister, dog, or like, cousin.

545
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,647
      One of those things.

546
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,448
      Sibling of some kind.

547
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,516
    Oh, I feel safer already.

548
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,185
       That's disgusting.

549
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,387
 Welcome to small town America.

550
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,355
 What's the population, anyway?

551
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,891
12.

552
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,626
      Everybody's related.

553
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,630
 No, there's about two or three
   of us that aren't related.

554
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,499
         - That's cool.
         - That is nice.

555
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,634
        Have you seen Ty?

556
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:48,505
          No, but, uh,
      have you seen Susie?

557
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,839
     Who the hell is Susie?

558
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:52,442
 - The girl I was on yesterday.
            - Elena.

559
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:56,813
   Oh, no, Elena was supposed
 to open the door for me today,

560
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,849
   and luckily I had the key,
            you know.

561
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,918
            So, yeah.
      - Let's go find her.

562
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,787
  Dude, they'll show up later.

563
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,290
     Yeah, she ain't tryin'
          to find you.

564
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,626
         You guys wanna-
     you guys wanna set up?

565
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,728
         Absolutely not.
  Hey, where's craft services?

566
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,530
          I'll find it.
 It's probably down here, right?

567
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:16,533
          Don't worry,
     I'll help you tomorrow.

568
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:18,501
        - But it's today.
       - I'm just playin'.

569
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,670
     Hey, where's the girls'
         dressing room?

570
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,906
   Oh, the little girls' room
          is this way.

571
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,244
              J, J.
              - Yo!

572
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,645
          - What's up?
        - Just chillin'.

573
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,313
  I got some ladies in the car,

574
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,648
         about to go get
        some drinks, man.

575
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,416
         You wanna roll?
          - Absolutely.

576
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,651
         Where we goin'?

577
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:37,721
     Some town about, what,
       15 miles from here?

578
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,522
            15 miles?

579
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,559
      You wanna go or what?

580
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:45,662
   Oh, that's Hollis Oklahoma.

581
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,297
        Let me fix this.

582
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:49,332
    Why you gonna go so far?

583
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,800
     It's a dry county, man.

584
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,469
   Like, they're in a drought?

585
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,638
          - No alcohol.
             - None?

586
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,406
              None.

587
00:37:56,408 --> 00:38:00,010
  I was thinking about getting
     a bottle of everything.

588
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:02,412
      Hey, I can come with.

589
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,547
     Hey, I can stay behind.

590
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,350
   That means he's not coming?

591
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,020
     No, I'm gonna hang out.
 Just text me when you get back.

592
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:12,622
    Okay, yeah, it'll just be
        one on one time.

593
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,325
         Together. Okay.
              - No.

594
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,294
          Just go, man.
 - I'm gonna be out in the car.

595
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,029
        J, I'll get you.

596
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,564
See you.

597
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,474
Oh, oh, oh, yeah,

598
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,778
      I made you this mask,
        it's, oh, scary.

599
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,391
         Ouija Ouikend.

600
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,093
      It's not that ghetto.

601
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,867
    Oh, sweet, video glasses.

602
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,583
     These are really cool.

603
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,505
   Are they, like 3D glasses,
             or-- ?

604
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,750
     Don't put 'em back on.

605
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,645
       These are Danny's.

606
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,050
           You got me.

607
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,919
             Danny!

608
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,961
  It's not even gonna be scary.

609
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,329
       Yeah, it's gonna be
          totally lame.

610
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,964
     Whatever, you're gonna
          be screaming

611
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,100
    and hanging onto my shirt
   before we even get inside.

612
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,235
               Hi.

613
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:00,837
            Whatever.

614
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,172
 So, I won the thing last night.
          I'm Michelle.

615
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,008
 I think there might be tickets.

616
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,109
       Yeah, sure, thanks.

617
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,977
 We should have brought Ignacio.

618
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,679
             Figure.

619
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,781
       Leave Margo alone.

620
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,885
     Oh, awesome, thank you.

621
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,954
Don't forget the movie!

622
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,990
           It's better
   than<i> Paranormal Activity</i> !

623
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:58,194
          Don't forget
      <i> The Ouija Experiment</i>
        before you leave!

624
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,762
       That works so well.
       They're loving it.

625
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:02,031
        That's cool, but,

626
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,933
      how am I supposed to
         sell the movie

627
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:06,869
   if they're running' past me
     at 100 miles per hour?

628
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:11,140
          Oh, uh, okay,
      here's what we'll do.

629
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,775
 I'm not gonna scare 'em as bad

630
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:15,878
    so, it'll be a slow ghost
        so they walk by.

631
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,346
           Oh, great,

632
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,782
 because I do not wanna be stuck
      with all these movies

633
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,818
    at the end of the night.

634
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,221
    Speaking of slow ghosts,
         where's Justin?

635
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,057
 I don't know, I thought he was
     being a ghost already.

636
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,327
         No, no I placed
      everybody everywhere.

637
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,930
     Uh, he hasn't shown up.

638
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,199
      I'm so sorry, I mean,
      that's not like him.

639
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,367
         I'll text him.
             - Okay.

640
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:41,404
  And, um, have you seen Eric?

641
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,772
             What?!

642
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:45,141
Yeah, he hasn't shown up either.

643
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,442
          Big surprise.

644
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:48,177
      Don't worry about it.
      I'll take care of it.

645
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,179
        Okay, ready to go
         for round two.

646
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,248
              Okay.

647
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,385
I played Calvin, remember?

648
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,822
      Yeah, I was that guy.

649
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,758
    You mean the player guy?

650
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,960
    The one that makes girls
         buy him things?

651
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,229
       Look, come on, now,

652
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,264
   see, I'm nothing like that.
        It's just acting.

653
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,333
              Eric!

654
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:11,868
      Eric, get over here!

655
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,402
  Look, so if you just let me--

656
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,538
      Eric, get over here!

657
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,307
 Look, I'm gonna be right back,
       ladies, all right?

658
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,880
              What?
     - Where have you been?

659
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,883
  I've been over there minglin'
     with those sexy ladies.

660
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,484
        - Mingling, huh?
             - Yeah.

661
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,453
  then why aren't you in there

662
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,321
       vein' a ghost like
     you're supposed to be?

663
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,924
       Oh, I'm up already?

664
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:37,126
        I didn't realize
       they needed me yet.

665
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:41,998
     You need to calm down,
     'cause I'm pretty sure
     Justin got it covered.

666
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,134
    No, he is not in there...
             either.

667
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,003
    Am I the only person here

668
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,405
    concerned about the level
       of professionalism

669
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,274
     that is expected of us?

670
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:54,143
    Look, I am professional.

671
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,146
        No... you're not!

672
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,415
     Okay, but what you are

673
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:04,153
 is working at the lowest level
    of the oldest profession.

674
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,522
          Uh, she means
      you're a prostitute.

675
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,560
         Well, at least
        I'm getting paid.

676
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:14,163
        Get... in there.

677
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,998
          Bye, ladies.

678
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,201
    She thinks she's my mama.

679
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,913
It was the wiggle
         when she walks.

680
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:38,287
The tour is now over.

681
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:41,424
       The overnight tour
        is about to begin

682
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:46,062
      for only the winners
    of last night's contest.

683
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,438
    You don't have to go home

684
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,908
    but you can't stay here.

685
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,277
       Have a great night.

686
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,092
              Um...

687
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,661
             Danny?

688
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:21,564
      Is this the backstage
           area place

689
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,100
   you were telling me to go?

690
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,542
           Let's see.

691
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,512
      "Zinna Death Scene."

692
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,981
      "Zinna greets guests

693
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:42,585
     then exits to backstage
      for her death scene."

694
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,154
        Yeah, just read.

695
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:47,123
              Um...

696
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,599
              What?

697
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:07,510
    "Danny leads guests into
     another haunted room."

698
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:09,178
              Okay.

699
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,447
              Hmm.

700
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,554
           Let's see.

701
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,525
     "Zinna grabs fake blood
      and pours it on her.

702
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:24,427
      Guests should arrive
        in five minutes.

703
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:28,364
    Zinna must hurry to make
      the death look real."

704
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:31,334
     Fake blood, fake blood.

705
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,637
     If I were fake blood...

706
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,306
      ...where would I be?

707
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:43,179
  If I was Danny, crazy person,
     placin' the fake blood,

708
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:45,381
      where would I put it?

709
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,456
          I don't know
      where this blood is.

710
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,391
  I'm gonna have to ask Danny.

711
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,627
     I'm never bona find it
           down here.

712
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,331
      This place is creepy.

713
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,073
               Oh!

714
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,575
    No, it's just me, Danny.

715
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:14,110
           Oh, my God.

716
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,012
   - Worked pretty good, huh?
             - Yeah.

717
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,446
Shh.

718
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,482
   They're on their way, okay.
    They're in the next room.

719
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:23,586
  You take the blood, and okay,
        after this scene,

720
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:24,687
       we're gonna head up
         to the balcony

721
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,222
       and get your audio
         on my recorder.

722
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,591
          Okay, got it.
       How do I put it on?

723
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:29,759
        What do you mean?

724
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,494
 Just put it all over your body.

725
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:33,362
       Especially get some
          in the mouth.

726
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,031
           Ew, really?

727
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:38,067
     Don't worry, it tastes-
     it tastes really good.

728
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,301
            It does?

729
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:42,405
    Yeah, it's just a mixture
         of Karo syrup,

730
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,640
          food coloring
       and some chocolate.

731
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,076
    It looks kind of chunky.

732
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,647
   That's just the strawberry
          I put in it.

733
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:54,784
 Mmm, it does taste pretty good.

734
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:58,120
              Okay.
          You hurry up.

735
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:59,655
           I got this.

736
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,524
              Okay.

737
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,693
           All right.

738
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,435
This is my favorite room.

739
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,705
         But, be careful
   when walking into this one.

740
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,707
         Because this...

741
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:58,114
     Many have died walking
       on this very floor.

742
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,348
        Anyone know how?

743
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,451
     Well, let me tell you.
   Come on in, all the way in.

744
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,121
   Get right around this area.

745
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,555
              Wait.

746
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:07,590
              Good.

747
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,592
          Did you know

748
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:13,529
            that when
   messing with a Ouija board

749
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:18,167
     if you forget to say...
           goodbye...

750
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:19,802
            ...hi...

751
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,705
      ...then what happens

752
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:26,475
   is the spirit is let loose.

753
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,778
       Yes, loose just to
         go all around.

754
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,748
       And what that does

755
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,717
             is it--
          no smiling--

756
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,319
       it allows a portal

757
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,356
 to be opened up into our world.

758
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,159
           And that...

759
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:46,695
     ...is when the spirit,
    they can grow stronger...

760
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,864
       ...and stronger...

761
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,500
 ...to where they are no longer
           a spirit...

762
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,637
  ...but something much more...

763
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,872
       ...like an evil...

764
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,440
            ...being.

765
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,611
 It's not moving little things.

766
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,246
               No.

767
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,949
     It's moving much more.

768
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,785
Did you hear that?

769
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,253
       It's getting angry.

770
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:13,689
   Quickly, we must outrun it!

771
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,724
        To the basement!

772
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,362
       You're not moving!
        To the basement!

773
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,865
...is the only one
       who's been scared.

774
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,267
Why do you keep
        calling me that?

775
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,904
     You guys, this is going
         to be so lame.

776
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:31,974
        Stop being a nob.
      Maybe it gets better.

777
00:53:31,976 --> 00:53:34,410
         You know what?
       At least it's free.

778
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:36,545
       Okay, yeah, thanks.

779
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,824
       Something's wrong.

780
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,932
             Oh no!

781
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:59,702
   The ghost has killed Zinna!

782
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:04,840
       Quickly, let's run!
       The ghost is here!

783
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:07,710
 Yeah, that's kid of impressive.

784
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:10,913
      Come! It was a ghost!
              Whoo!

785
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,014
               No.

786
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,484
Oh, for God's sake.

787
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,386
Be afraid.

788
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,425
Yeah. Right this way.

789
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,961
       All right, now this
       is a special room.

790
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,731
     Now, this was actually
         the first time

791
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,801
 anyone ever died of gonorrhea.

792
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:36,872
That was a good one.

793
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,440
          It's just me.

794
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,541
     You guys recognize him?

795
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:42,711
      It's the C to the A,
           to the L...

796
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,613
         No, Danny. No.

797
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,449
         This is Calvin
   from<i> The Ouija Experiment.</i>

798
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,817
              Eric.

799
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,388
        Come on, give him
      a round of applause.

800
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,589
          He did good.

801
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:56,825
       Well, hello again,
      Miss British Accent.

802
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,628
          Hello, Eric.
    You gonna behave yourself
           this time?

803
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,631
    Danny, would you tell her
        I'm a teddy bear?

804
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,034
     Not just a teddy bear,
      he's a grizzly bear!

805
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:06,902
      Ah, that's cold, man.
          That's cold.

806
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,370
           I'm sorry,
  I shouldn't be touching you.

807
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:09,838
       No, you shouldn't.

808
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,374
 All right, set down your stuff.

809
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,044
    You know, we're actually
   going to stay here tonight.

810
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:16,979
          Here? Really?

811
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,048
           This place?
             - Yes.

812
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,084
            - Gross.
             - Yeah.

813
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:24,320
  I thought it was pretty nice,
             though.

814
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,389
   Hey, is that a Ouija board?

815
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:30,626
     Oh, actually, it's not
      supposed to be here.

816
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:33,495
Oh, yeah, no one here
       set it up for you.

817
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,633
 I have brought an EVP recorder.

818
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,635
  Electronic Voice Phenomenon.

819
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:43,072
   What it does, is it records
     frequencies and sounds

820
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:46,041
      that you do not hear
        by the human ear.

821
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,510
         This is a mini
       cassette recorder.

822
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,012
        Whats a cassette?

823
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,680
             Really?
      you're gonna do this?

824
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,682
      I said it ironically.

825
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:57,820
 Uh, normally it records sounds
         that you're not
        supposed to hear,

826
00:55:57,822 --> 00:56:00,389
   but for some reason you can
 hear it when you play it back.

827
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,690
    I don't really get that.

828
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,760
        Wait, so, is this
 the Ouija board from the movie?

829
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:08,831
Yes, it is.

830
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,633
       So, can we play it?

831
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,136
       Guys, I don't think
    we should play with this.

832
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,706
  I have a really bad feeling.
    I felt it yesterday too.

833
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,007
       So you are scared.

834
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:22,411
       No, it's not that.
      It's something else.

835
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:24,513
           I'm getting
      a really weird vibe.

836
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,448
   Especially from this room.

837
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,883
         As you should,

838
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:31,553
      because this room is
     a paranormal hot spot.

839
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,389
    If you really wanna know
        what's going on,

840
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,090
     let's go to the source.

841
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:39,461
 So, you wanna summon a spirit,
      and record its voice?

842
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,796
            Exactly.

843
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,598
 Okay, gather around everybody.

844
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,433
 Okay, I'm sitting next to you.

845
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,735
    You know, for protection.

846
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:53,709
Okay, so maybe I need protection
        from a few things
          in this room.

847
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,144
      It's full of thrills.

848
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:57,179
 You know, I can thrill you more

849
00:56:57,181 --> 00:57:00,015
         than any ghost
      would ever dare try.

850
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,750
              Oh...

851
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,719
             Really?
  Michael Jackson, "Thriller?"

852
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:06,855
       That's all you got?
             - Damn.

853
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,091
        You're too smart
    for your own good, girl.

854
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:14,630
           But a large
      intellectual capacity
   isn't greater than wisdom.

855
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,198
           Say, what?

856
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,201
       Alanis Morissette.
     I can quote music too.

857
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:21,637
             Ah ha.
      That hurt. That hurt.

858
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:24,506
         Smart and sexy.

859
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:25,841
          I like that.

860
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,877
     - You guys wanna begin?
          - All right.

861
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,847
   - Put your hands over here.
    It's good if we overlap.

862
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,515
           - Hey, man.

863
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:34,616
    - I'm sorry, it's just--

864
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,785
      Just thought I'd help
          a little bit.

865
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,523
             Ready?

866
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:43,792
        Is anybody there?

867
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,527
        Is anybody there?

868
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,232
        Is anybody there?

869
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,870
        Is anybody there?

870
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,112
               B.

871
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,219
               L.

872
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,756
               C.

873
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,028
               N.

874
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:23,966
               Y.

875
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:27,769
     Is that where you are?
          The balcony?

876
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,179
              Yes.

877
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:41,583
     You're in the balcony.
       You guys wanna go?

878
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,085
             Really?

879
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,220
   Yeah, let's check this out.

880
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:47,122
       Come on, let's go.

881
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:48,590
         You guys ready?

882
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,259
              Okay.

883
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,565
            Michelle
             - Yeah?

884
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:58,300
   I don't have a good feeling
           about this.

885
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:01,737
 It's just all the spirit energy
    flying around in the air.

886
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:03,238
          Don't worry.

887
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,973
       Come on, let it go.
         Just have fun.

888
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:05,941
            Come on.

889
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:09,545
 I didn't give this free ticket
        to Debbie Downer.

890
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,213
       I gave it to Margo.

891
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,115
          I don't know.

892
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,284
  You wanna fit in more, right?

893
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,855
  Yeah, well, you gotta get out
      of your comfort zone.

894
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:23,158
   Come on. It's gonna be fun.
       You gotta open up.

895
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,760
              Okay.

896
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:26,929
             Ready?
       Come on. Let's go.

897
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:33,168
  Come upon the spooky balcony.

898
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,238
       I am going to do an
          EVP session.

899
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,607
  Don't mind the spooky lights.

900
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,809
          But let us...

901
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,010
            ...begin.

902
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,312
           All right?

903
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,017
     The spirit that haunts
      this establishment...

904
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:51,119
        ...are you here?

905
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,026
  Can you prove your existence?

906
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,028
      Yeah, show yourself!

907
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,264
     Stop, that's not funny.

908
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,834
         Where are you?

909
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,910
          Where's Eric?

910
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:16,912
            I dunno.
            Michelle?

911
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,715
    I don't know where he is.
     He was with us before.

912
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,950
      This is just part of
    the haunted house, right?

913
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,820
       Let's go find him.

914
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:26,388
            Come on.

915
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,896
Can't we turn the light on?

916
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:37,099
   We can in the control room.

917
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:39,968
        Uh, it's all set
     to automatic right now.

918
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,837
   But we can do it manually.

919
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:45,207
    But, uh, yeah this is all
        part of the show.

920
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:48,877
   So this is just all a part
          of the show?

921
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:55,851
   Okay, um, stay close to me.

922
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,287
              Eric?

923
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,057
         Eric, you okay?

924
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,159
      That thing isn't even
         doing anything.

925
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,995
   It says danger and caution.

926
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,263
    Don't worry, we're safe.

927
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,198
              Eric!

928
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,670
         Eric, you okay?

929
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,220
   We need to get out of here.

930
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,456
    We gotta call the police.

931
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:39,027
 It's downstairs in the basement
           in my pack.

932
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,962
      Shit, I'm not getting
         any reception.

933
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,764
         I've got a bar.

934
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,770
           911? Hello?

935
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,271
   We're at the Ritz theater.

936
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,240
       We need some help.

937
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,475
              Shit.

938
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,212
 Okay, we need to open the door.
   We've gotta open the door.

939
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:06,114
   If we open it for a second
 maybe we'll get some reception.

940
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,883
          No, we can't.

941
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:11,052
     We can't be those girls
        in horror movies
     that do stupid things.

942
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:12,921
          We have to do
      smart people things.

943
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:14,923
      Would a smart person
          stay in here?

944
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,492
       Smart people would
         call the poise.

945
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:19,261
 Yeah, we need to open the door.

946
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:21,429
         If you hold it
       from the other side

947
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:24,065
      then maybe it'll stop
       that jangle thing.

948
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,803
      It won't seeing open.
             - Okay.

949
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:29,805
             Slowly.

950
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,582
       I've got two bars.

951
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,085
              Okay.

952
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,224
              Okay.

953
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:54,229
<i> 911, what is your emergency?</i>

954
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:57,299
   Hi, I'm at the Ritz Theater
       in Wellington, TX,

955
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:59,167
  and I'm on the horror tour...

956
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:03,004
 No, actually, I heard gunshots.
         That means you
      have to come, right?

957
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,373
<i> Did you say you're</i>
      <i> at the horror tour?</i>

958
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,309
        Shit. Yes, I did.

959
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:08,877
     But there are actually
          people dying.

960
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:11,880
     There's a creature and
    it's trying to attack us.

961
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,548
<i> Is this some kind of joke?</i>

962
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,484
     No, this is not a joke.
     We're really in danger.

963
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:18,186
        Please, you have
        to send someone.

964
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,121
  There's something out there.
      It's hunting us down.

965
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:22,123
     It's trying to kill us.

966
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,026
<i> Look, ma'am,</i>
<i>making prank calls isn't funny.</i>

967
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,995
      <i> You costs taxpayers</i>
         <i> lots of money</i>

968
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:31,266
 <i> especially if they're based on</i>
     <i> ghosts and creatures.</i>

969
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:32,434
             Please.

970
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:34,436
    Please, I'm telling you.

971
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:37,405
   There are dead bodies here.
    You have to send someone.

972
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,908
       Blame it all on me.
    My name is Michelle Joy.

973
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,643
     I'm at the Ritz Theater
         in Wellington.

974
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:43,211
        Please, you have
        to send someone.

975
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,081
      You have to help us.

976
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,949
<i> Okay, I'll send someone.</i>

977
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:51,319
    <i> This better be for real.</i>
  <i> We have this call recorded.</i>

978
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:55,156
  Just send someone, you bitch.

979
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:57,292
      This is fucking nuts!

980
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,313
            Come on!

981
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,083
Where are you?!

982
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,919
         I'm over here!

983
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,486
     Oh, my God, it's light.

984
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,200
          Where is it?
  - How do we get out of here?!

985
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:47,202
 Who gives a shit where it is?!

986
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,408
    Oh, my God, are you okay?

987
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,612
             Margo!
    Margo, what's the matter?

988
01:06:57,614 --> 01:06:59,214
       There's a woman...

989
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:02,317
            She cap-
  she captured the thing and...

990
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,319
    ...she has it chained up.

991
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:08,189
    Margo, it doesn't matter,
         we've gotta go!

992
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,658
         Margo, come on!

993
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,329
    I'm so glad you're here.

994
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:16,231
     There's a thing inside
       trying to kill us.

995
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,471
       She's not a thing.
              - Oh.

996
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,409
Shit!

997
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,612
           Get inside!

998
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,057
        Y'all know where
   the downstairs basement is?

999
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:44,826
         You gotta take
    the old hallway this way.

1000
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,729
           Let's move.

1001
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,566
         Well, move it!

1002
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,081
     Walk down these stairs
           right here.

1003
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,401
 I told y'all not to be messin'
       with those boards.

1004
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:29,437
    They're real and they can
        bring back evil.

1005
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,341
 They can, and now you got your
   proof down here, don't you?

1006
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,678
   You kids are so headstrong.

1007
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,614
 You just think you're so smart.

1008
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,816
    But none of you listened.

1009
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:44,319
        We didn't do it.
          It was them.

1010
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,154
    We didn't even touch it.

1011
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:48,756
       Y'all had something
         to do with it.

1012
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:51,359
     You both had something
         to do with it.

1013
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:55,797
    You were all part of this
    ghost and spirit weekend.

1014
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,262
No.

1015
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,653
 Now, y'all just gonna be rude?

1016
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:56,791
   Or are you gonna say hello
        to my baby girl?

1017
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,741
   Let me ask y'all somethin'.

1018
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,514
   Do you know how hard it was
      for me to let her go

1019
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,349
         the first time?

1020
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,889
          I tell ya...

1021
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,261
         ...it was hell.

1022
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:36,764
   See, I didn't even want her
       in the first place.

1023
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:40,301
    She was a curse from God.

1024
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:48,376
 See, God cursed me and my wife
     for lovin' each other.

1025
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:52,380
     He didn't take it well,
            you know,

1026
01:10:52,382 --> 01:10:55,383
    kindred folk procreatin'.

1027
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,620
   So He doomed my wife to die

1028
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:01,656
    giving birth to that girl
          right there.

1029
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:06,394
And if that wasn't bad enough...

1030
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:10,865
      ...He cursed me again
     in an unimaginable way.

1031
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,437
     He brought forth to me

1032
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,907
  a foul, vile creature-child.

1033
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,678
       And then he made me
          feel for it.

1034
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,650
   And even though I tried...

1035
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,455
 ...my heart can't just seem to-

1036
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,725
 to hate or push away somethin'
      that's a part of it.

1037
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,762
    After all those years...

1038
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:46,467
          ...I finally-
   I couldn't take it anymore.

1039
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,770
      I couldn't live with
       the fact that I had

1040
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:53,908
  my daughter locked downstairs
         in a basement.

1041
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,811
      It was sheltered from
      the whole damn world.

1042
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,952
      I was ashamed of her.

1043
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,824
         She's a freak.

1044
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,993
       She was a creature.

1045
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,598
   She wasn't from this earth.
    She did not belong here.

1046
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,805
         And one day...

1047
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,611
        ...I walked in...

1048
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,849
   ...and I put this very gun
       to her forehead...

1049
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:42,423
        ...but I couldn't
        pull the trigger.

1050
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:45,126
  I tried but I couldn't do it.

1051
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:47,462
        I couldn't do it!

1052
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,700
     I didn't I didn't know
        what else to do.

1053
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,570
  I didn't know what else to do
    so I stopped feedin' her.

1054
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:58,039
   I stopped givin' her water.

1055
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,710
It was like three weeks later...

1056
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:07,782
        ...I walked in...

1057
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:11,386
         ...and she was
      just layin' there...

1058
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:13,054
            ...still.

1059
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:22,163
     I reached down to feel
         for a pulse...

1060
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,734
      That was when I knew
          she was dead.

1061
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:36,043
    And the strange thing is,
     I was relieved, right?

1062
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,948
    I was relieved because...

1063
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,885
        ...I didn't feel
    like a murderer anymore.

1064
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:45,753
     I felt this big weight
          off my back.

1065
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:49,023
       You know, the curse
    had finally been lifted.

1066
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,064
       That might sound...
        awful and cruel.

1067
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,037
  But what would you have done?

1068
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,639
              Huh?!

1069
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,948
    What would you have done?

1070
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,454
         Don't judge me!

1071
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,627
 Yeah, I did unspeakable things.

1072
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,062
             I did.

1073
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,699
 But here you both are right now

1074
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,068
  lookin' at me like I'm crazy!

1075
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:44,245
         You're the ones
    that brought her back...

1076
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,149
      ...using that board.

1077
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:52,787
   I'll tell you right now...

1078
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:55,756
        ...I can't do it
       all over again, no.

1079
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,627
             See...

1080
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:02,730
       ...God has given me
        a second chance.

1081
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,504
 This is my shot at redemption.

1082
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,908
 I'm gonna take good care of her
           this time.

1083
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,746
 I'm gonna take good care of her
           this time.

1084
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,657
        I know that look.

1085
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,661
 I know that look all too well.

1086
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,204
    I always hated that look.

1087
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,310
           I hate it!

1088
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:06,561
 Do either of you wanna tell me
 what you think that look means?

1089
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,935
    It means only one thing.

1090
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,779
       It means that she's
          ready to eat.

1091
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:35,189
      Please... please, no.

1092
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,092
          No, not you?

1093
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,632
          Either way...

1094
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:49,604
  ...there's gonna be a lot of
   bones for me to get rid of.

1095
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,142
  She likes the smell of blood.

1096
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,046
      It makes her hungry.

1097
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,113
           Let her go.

1098
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,853
       Margo, get the gun.

1099
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:47,955
       Margo, get the gun.

1100
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:59,366
   We're not just pretty girls
       in horror movies...

1101
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:02,136
    ...we make smart choices.

1102
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,844
            Kill it.

1103
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,549
     I don't know if I can.
            - Do it!

1104
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:52,119
        Pull the trigger!

1105
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:36,897
        Let me have that.

1106
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,436
     I'm sorry, I couldn't-

1107
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:44,238
        I couldn't do it.

1108
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,141
          I felt her--
       I felt it hurting.

1109
01:20:47,143 --> 01:20:49,376
          The thing...

1110
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,178
      ...I felt it's pain.

1111
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,147
     It doesn't matter what
     that thing looked like,

1112
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:55,182
      that thing was human.

1113
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,918
          Human or not,

1114
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,487
     it didn't belong here.

1115
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,490
      There are some things
      in this world that--
