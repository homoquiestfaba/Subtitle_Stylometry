1
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,325
My grandmother used to say...

2
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:11,525
if you want to make God laugh,
tell Him your plans.

3
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:54,370
Girls.

4
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:55,811
Girls.

5
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,167
Told you it was him.

6
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:58,833
What is this?

7
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,143
Nice ball.

8
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:02,739
Wow.

9
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,372
You guys play a lot, huh?

10
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:05,745
Where do you play?

11
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:06,840
In the street.

12
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,779
In the street?

13
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:10,855
What about the cars?

14
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,652
We have to move every time.

15
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,122
It stinks.

16
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:21,364
You over here.

17
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,228
You over here.

18
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,460
And you here.

19
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,365
What's your name?

20
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:25,060
Dave.

21
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,499
Huh?

22
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:26,536
David.

23
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,970
Are you ready, David?

24
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:33,968
He-..

25
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,138
What?

26
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,072
Where's the ball?

27
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,577
I guess I was sleeping, huh?

28
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,183
Francisco.

29
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:48,484
Hm.

30
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,357
My name looks pretty
lonely on this ball.

31
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,623
How about I get
a few more names on here for you?

32
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:53,857
Like...

33
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,260
Tomas Cordoba?

34
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,395
Uh-huh.

35
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:13,709
All right, guys.

36
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,442
I'll bring this one back to you.

37
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,918
I promise.

38
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:18,118
Okay.

39
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:18,848
See ya.

40
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:19,982
All right.

41
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,117
What are we gonna play
with until you get back?

42
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,690
Uh, Jasmine?

43
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,195
Could you get one of
those practice balls Fran-...

44
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,000
Call me if you need a manager, eh?

45
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,339
Thanks.

46
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,349
All right.

47
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,715
I'm ready.

48
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,316
Ola!

49
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,061
I'm a soccer player, man.

50
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,000
I hate interviews.

51
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,560
I told you,
I'm not a speaker.

52
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:22,014
I happy to have the opportunity and,
and to be here with all of you--

53
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,425
I am thrilled to be here
in the outstanding presence

54
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,298
of you beautiful people.

55
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:46,737
I am...uh, ecstatic to
be here in front

56
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,472
of all you beautiful people today.

57
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:51,243
I want to thank my wonderful
manager Francisco.

58
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,240
Morning.

59
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,209
Pepito.

60
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,485
Make sure you get
five cuts out of that.

61
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,290
Marco, remember,
not too many jalapenos.

62
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,558
Too spicy, they won't eat it.

63
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:15,729
They don't have
the stomach we have.

64
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:22,735
Morning, Manny.

65
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:23,832
Morning.

66
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,034
Henri...

67
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,246
have more than
enough fresh mint at the bar.

68
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:28,574
You bet.

69
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,339
And don't worry,
I have the mojitos down.

70
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:30,779
You better.

71
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:31,941
That's our signature drink.

72
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:35,646
And if they ask, say you're
Irish-Cuban, uh, Mexican-Cuban.

73
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,449
The whole place is
something Cuban for the week.

74
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:38,181
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,281
Try his new drink,
see how good it is.

76
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:41,789
Excuse me.

77
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,129
That's a good sauce.

78
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,825
Buenas, Amelia.

79
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,300
Buenos dias, senor.

80
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,411
Anybody seen Nina?

81
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,945
I can't believe this.

82
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,481
I think I left my wallet at home.

83
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:51,261
Can I come back and pay you later?

84
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,456
I live close by.

85
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:17,586
Jose, what's up with Nina?

86
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:18,919
She was late yesterday,

87
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,889
and today's she's,
uh, twenty minutes late.

88
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:21,754
That's two days in a row.

89
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,055
Plus calling in sick last week
at the last minute makes three.

90
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:26,187
And you know
what happens at three Jose.

91
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,164
She'll be here.

92
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:32,095
Can't run my business like this.

93
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,499
I just can't.

94
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,672
Jose try this.

95
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,378
Chili.

96
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:45,848
Oh, hey, Pepi let me try that.

97
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,720
Hm.

98
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,490
Just a little bit.

99
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:57,929
What's for family dinner?

100
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:58,827
It's almost ready, yes?

101
00:09:58,897 --> 00:09:59,454
Yep.

102
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:02,499
Chili Rellenos and
roasted quail en mole.

103
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,369
That's a pretty fancy
family dinner.

104
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,130
The chilies are going bad, man.

105
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,330
I'm talking about the quails.

106
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:10,635
They could have been a special.

107
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,004
Oh, I see how it works, eh?

108
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:14,739
You just make the fancy staff
orders and I pay for them, right?

109
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:15,538
Wrong.

110
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,775
We cook for the customers,
not the staff.

111
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,940
Next time you feed them

112
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,617
So what you got there in your hand?

113
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:58,916
Butterfly.

114
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,581
And what color is it?

115
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,627
- Pink
- No

116
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:03,557
Green.

117
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,528
Okay, now what
do butterflies do?

118
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,530
Yeah!

119
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:08,929
That's great.

120
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,467
Let's see if you could do it again.

121
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,000
To the cloud?

122
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,002
I'm ready, to the cloud.

123
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:14,935
Let's go.

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,473
Wow.

125
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,505
Okay, Luce,
are you ready to play again?

126
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,338
Yes.

127
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:20,877
Okay.

128
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:22,471
I'm gonna count.

129
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,276
Family dinner, everyone

130
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,324
You're ready, right?

131
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:40,598
Let's go!

132
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,156
Marco, andele, andele.

133
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,359
Pepi.

134
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,611
Today's special is pescado Siete Mares.

135
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,346
Shrimp and crab legs over
Mexican sweet black rice,

136
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,979
squash with a papaya lemon oil.

137
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:07,353
There are three boxes of shrimp
in the walk-in, people.

138
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:08,653
So push it, push it, push it.

139
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,594
By the end of the day this item
should be eighty-sixed in my kitchen.

140
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,153
The last special is scallops.

141
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,459
I think you've all
served this before

142
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:16,397
so I'm not gonna
say anything else about it.

143
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,627
I got a special treat, Pepito.

144
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:21,533
This coming Friday
the National Mexican soccer team,

145
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:24,836
along with the coach,
will be here for the Gold Cup.

146
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,207
They play the U.S.
out in Jersey next week.

147
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,075
I'm putting them
in on Kevin's section.

148
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,377
There will be no autographs.

149
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,788
I will ask them personally
and then, uh you can ask me.

150
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,601
Francisco made the reservations.

151
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,897
He asked for you.

152
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,007
Manny, I'm sorry.

153
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:00,941
I don't want to hear it.

154
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:01,670
Look, I have things--

155
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,769
Things?

156
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:06,542
Three kids and comes down here
from the Bronx everyday.

157
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,848
You wanna know how many days she's
been late in the last four years?

158
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:09,681
Zero Nina.

159
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:10,288
Zero.

160
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:10,652
I know.

161
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:11,619
I know how hard that must be.
You know.

162
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:12,212
You know.

163
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,119
You know.

164
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,351
Okay, so you know.

165
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,892
So you know how easy
it will be for you with no kids,

166
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,257
and know to find another...

167
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:19,359
Manny, please!

168
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,260
Give me another chance.

169
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,026
I promise I'll make everything good.

170
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,965
How could you be so--

171
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,207
...so what?

172
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:33,375
Unfair?

173
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,113
It would be unfair,
if in fact, you weren't late.

174
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,603
It would be unfair to
your co-workers for me

175
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,774
to let them continue
doing your job.

176
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,748
This is the second day in a row, Nina.

177
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,052
Not counting the times
people look the other way or,

178
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,589
or cover for you.

179
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:47,218
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,725
You called in sick twice last week.

181
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,385
Then you show up to work hung-over.

182
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,263
I was not hung-over.

183
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,457
It's too much already.

184
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,693
Manny, I was not hung-over,
I was sick.

185
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,631
You directing traffic for
the construction site?

186
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,102
Stay out of this.

187
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,139
Oh.

188
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:09,507
Thank you! Thanks! That's nice.

189
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:35,361
Nina!

190
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,268
Nina. Nina.

191
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:47,247
He's unconscious
but I think he'll survive.

192
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,619
Thank you.

193
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,224
Guess I'll see you around.

194
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:55,587
Hey.

195
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,126
Why were you late?

196
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:58,856
You know my brother.

197
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:00,231
Oh, trust me.

198
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,027
I know your brother.

199
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,396
He's a jerk.

200
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,034
Excuse me, you going in?

201
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,101
No.

202
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,158
Thank you.

203
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:10,068
He didn't have to humiliate me
like that in front of everyone.

204
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,542
I've been working for him
for four years.

205
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,275
And you tell him
that I wasn't hung-over.

206
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,012
I was really sick.

207
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,712
I'm pregnant.

208
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:05,220
This is one of the first mornings
I haven't thrown up.

209
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,367
Okay, I've had enough for today.

210
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:13,595
Thank you.

211
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,605
You'd better get back to your boss man.

212
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,004
Wait. Wait. Nina.

213
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:21,872
So what now?

214
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,944
Guess I'm gonna have to
figure that out, right?

215
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,216
You wanna talk about it?

216
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:45,497
Manny...

217
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,035
Jose left.

218
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,238
What do you mean, left?

219
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,981
Who's gonna run the line?

220
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,544
Jose is gonna run the line.

221
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,455
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

222
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:08,423
Sorry for the interruption.

223
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:11,051
We are The Dramatics and
we'd like to entertain you.

224
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:15,259
After our presentation donations
will be gladly accepted.

225
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,467
You can do this.

226
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:00,205
It's all about the presentation.

227
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,006
We don't need him.

228
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,803
We don't need him.

229
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,024
I have to call my brother.

230
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,361
You don't have your phone?

231
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,434
Here.

232
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,278
Pepito, chop these.

233
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,307
How may I help you?

234
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:41,009
Manny?

235
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:41,949
Where are you?

236
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:42,917
I'm with Nina.

237
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,782
Who the heck is Nina?

238
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:44,877
I'm your brother.

239
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:45,613
I know man.

240
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,622
I know.

241
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:57,096
Uh, sir, you owe me a five.

242
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:57,860
I gave you a ten.

243
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:58,765
That's three-fifty.

244
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,394
I, I need to help Nina right now.

245
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,267
You need to do what?

246
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:02,339
You need to be here.

247
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,601
You work at a restaurant
not a counseling clinic.

248
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,233
You gave me five.

249
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,476
I gave you three-fifty.

250
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:09,604
Water one-fifty.

251
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,738
Now you better
get back here before I--

252
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:11,507
I can't.

253
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:12,071
I can't.

254
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,384
What do you mean, you can't.

255
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,648
Just look in your till, man.

256
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:16,951
You'll see...

257
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:17,986
that I gave you a ten.

258
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:18,578
Listen to me idiota.

259
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:20,248
If you're not here
in the next ten minutes

260
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,950
you better be
at the unemployment office.

261
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:22,617
Manny?

262
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:23,660
Hello?

263
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,932
P-Police?

264
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,702
Ha! Go ahead, Korea.

265
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:37,865
Call 'em. Call 'em for stealing my money.

266
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:38,943
Not from Korea.

267
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,001
I'm from China.

268
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:41,169
You go now.

269
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,177
Alejandro!

270
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,941
Ale jandro! Llama la policia.

271
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:02,463
Police coming now.

272
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,306
You okay there?

273
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,774
One-fifty.

274
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,613
Have a nice day, sir.

275
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:27,652
Oh, man, that was crazy.

276
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:28,916
What happened?

277
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:29,960
Nothing.

278
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:32,994
It sounded like that Chinese guy
was speaking Spanish.

279
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,495
Uh, just a typical New York moment.

280
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,027
I'd hate to have to leave.

281
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,872
Why would you leave?

282
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,075
Takes money to live here.

283
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:52,043
Right about now, they're seating
the Winters' party in my section.

284
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,782
They're usually good for
a two hundred dollar tab.

285
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:55,544
You'll be fine.

286
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,348
Don't worry.

287
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,945
I mean, there's plenty of
restaurants in this city.

288
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,217
It's not that.

289
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:02,182
It's looking for a job.

290
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:03,191
It sucks.

291
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,462
The applications.

292
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,554
The questioning.

293
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,188
I'm gonna need references.

294
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,198
What do you think Manny's
gonna say about me?

295
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,699
Use me as a reference.

296
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:15,933
Who knows?

297
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,532
You're probably gonna be pounding
the pavement right along with me.

298
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:20,568
Hey.

299
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,270
Today's my first time.

300
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,177
It takes three times.

301
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:27,713
Yeah, but you're the chef.

302
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,420
You walked out.

303
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,047
Are you hungry?

304
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,458
Yeah.

305
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,649
I could eat.

306
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,159
I know a good place.

307
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,326
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with this dress.

308
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll probably put it on E-Bay.

309
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:51,768
Can I interest you in one of
my creations, young lady.

310
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,703
How about this nice frog?

311
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,841
I'm sorry,
I don't have any cash on me.

312
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:58,006
Okay.

313
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,016
Today's a beautiful day,
right?

314
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:01,576
I guess.

315
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:03,384
Describe it to me.

316
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:04,786
What?

317
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:09,421
Describe it to me and
this piece of art is yours.

318
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:22,066
Uh...there's some yellow flowers
blooming on a tree--

319
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:23,534
Forsythia.

320
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,104
And some purple ones, too.

321
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,208
Hyacinth.

322
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,872
You really like flowers, huh?

323
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,073
Oh, yeah.

324
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,880
What's going on across the street?

325
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:40,317
Uh...it's just an ordinary day in...

326
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,881
New York City, you know.

327
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:45,627
People rushing back and forth,
cars driving,

328
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,256
everybody's got somewhere to go,
somewhere to be.

329
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,334
Nobody really cares about nothing.

330
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:52,232
It's like a huge living clock.

331
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,667
It never stops.

332
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:55,602
Boy, I wish I could see that.

333
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,036
Thank you.

334
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:06,482
And you...

335
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,643
you keep it real.

336
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,615
I got my eye on you.

337
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,348
Thank you.

338
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:15,393
All right.

339
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,655
Thank you.

340
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:22,188
Look at this stuff.

341
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,961
I love stuff like this.

342
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,564
Do you have a mirror?

343
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,300
Thank you.

344
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:35,236
How do you do?

345
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:37,780
Looks pretty good, huh?

346
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,477
Sure.

347
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,844
Jose?

348
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,486
Oh, my gosh, it is you.

349
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:44,987
Helen.

350
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:45,953
Ah.

351
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,818
Look at you.

352
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:49,851
How have you been?

353
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,325
I haven't seen you in so long.

354
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:52,054
Fine.

355
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:53,657
Um, oh...

356
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:54,331
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:57,630
I...I heard about
what happened to you.

358
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,760
...this is Nina.

359
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,529
Nina, this is Helen.

360
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:02,966
Nice dress.

361
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,167
You must love Mexico, right?

362
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,343
It's my work uniform.

363
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,903
Um, where do you work?

364
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,572
Uh, we...work for my brother.

365
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:12,546
Manny?

366
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:14,551
Mm-hm.

367
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:16,609
I cook at his restaurant.

368
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:18,481
What happened to Club Madrid?

369
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:22,453
Uh, you know, uh...plans change.

370
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:24,588
So...you never played again?

371
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:28,689
Who is she?

372
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,992
Someone I use to see.

373
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,730
Someone you used to see, hm?

374
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,374
Do you think I'm as pretty as her?

375
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:39,877
Of course not.

376
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,071
She's prettier.

377
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,306
So, someone you use to see.

378
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,550
Boy, you are full of surprises.

379
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:53,981
Kay.

380
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,958
Can't even keep a phone well-fed.

381
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,855
You know, I had to get
a co-signer for this thing.

382
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:00,226
That's how screwed up my credit is.

383
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:01,388
Rent's due.

384
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:03,834
After rent, I'm down to my last five hundred.

385
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,701
I could be picking up
that big tip right now.

386
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:09,640
Where is this place?

387
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,471
Let's just eat around here.

388
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,539
Patience.

389
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:25,922
Hi.

390
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:26,682
Hi.

391
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,125
We only take applications on Tuesdays
from three p.m. to five p.m.

392
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:37,592
Uh, could you please tell Frannie
that Jose Suviran is here?

393
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:38,498
Regarding?

394
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:41,662
Just tell her that I need to
borrow a pound of saffron.

395
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:08,957
Jose.

396
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:10,833
What're you looking at?

397
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:13,165
I can't believe it!

398
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,499
Jose.

399
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:17,397
What a surprise, huh?

400
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,032
How're you doing, Frannie?

401
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:19,675
Oh, I'm good.

402
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:22,143
It's always good to see the man
with the mysterious beard.

403
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:25,272
Don't tell me you really came
thirty blocks for saffron?

404
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:26,781
Uh, we came here to eat.

405
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:28,044
This is my friend Nina.

406
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,544
Oh, just taking the day off,
then.

407
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:31,655
Nice dress.

408
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:33,547
Let me guess, it was Manny's idea.

409
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:34,989
It must have cost him a fortune.

410
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:36,684
NlNAHe made us pay for them.

411
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:38,187
Well, I would, too.

412
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:41,322
You like paella?

413
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,356
Yeah.

414
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:47,502
All right, we'll have your
mejillones and paella for two.

415
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:48,637
Okay.

416
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,271
Paella is full of the things
that you need for a child.

417
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:55,576
Who said I was having a child?

418
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,209
You did.

419
00:26:58,882 --> 00:26:59,746
No.

420
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,581
I said I was pregnant.

421
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:09,917
I'm not ready to have a kid.

422
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:12,491
You have a kid, your freedom's gone.

423
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:14,592
Things change.

424
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,100
Having a kid isn't just a change.

425
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,073
I don't think I even like children.

426
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,468
I just can't do it.

427
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:28,710
I'm broke.

428
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:31,138
And alone.

429
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:32,512
Alone?

430
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:39,581
I made my decision, okay?

431
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,258
What does the father think?

432
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:24,659
He's not a father,
and he's not going to be a father.

433
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:27,066
Just like I'm not going to be a mother.

434
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:28,969
Not now.

435
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:31,232
Nina Sharon?

436
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,645
He's all for getting it
taken care of.

437
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:38,339
Those are the words he used.

438
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:41,382
As if it were a wisdom tooth
to be pulled out.

439
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:45,312
You know, I wonder why kids
are always the problem of the mother.

440
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,318
Guys aren't inconvenienced by them.

441
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:48,858
It doesn't ruin their freedom.

442
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,951
And yet they have all this advice.

443
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:53,258
What's best for me.

444
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:59,770
Well...getting it taken care of
is what's best for me.

445
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:15,609
Put yourself in my shoes.

446
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,631
Do you love him?

447
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:36,497
I don't.

448
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:42,305
And what happens
when I find someone I do?

449
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:44,344
With a kid?

450
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,313
Forget it.

451
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,454
I invite someone up for a nightcap
and pay off the babysitter?

452
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:51,887
Mr. Right's gonna say, ''Oh, yeah.

453
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:55,015
I love taking care of
other people's children.

454
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:59,223
It's hard enough

455
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,530
it's hard enough to get people's

456
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,397
sincerity without
throwing kids in the mix.

457
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:13,101
I can't even take care of myself.

458
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,272
How am I gonna take care of a kid?

459
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:38,700
This is yours, this is yours.

460
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:39,133
Take that out.

461
00:30:39,236 --> 00:30:40,396
Take it, you're done, you're done.

462
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,196
Here, you're done.

463
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:41,930
Here, that's yours.

464
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:42,972
What's wrong with that plate?

465
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:43,562
They sent it back.

466
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,868
What do you mean they sent it back?

467
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:45,431
It's cold.

468
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:45,736
It's cold?

469
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,242
Phone, somebody better get the phone.

470
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:48,935
I better not hear more
than two rings, people.

471
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:50,343
Somebody better get the phone.

472
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:51,709
It's on the house, okay.

473
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,746
That's table two, table two.

474
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:55,584
Uh, I'm-I'm waiting
for the special.

475
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:56,346
Where's the snapper?

476
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,821
Here, take this out,
take this out to table ten.

477
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,049
Table...ten.

478
00:30:59,122 --> 00:30:59,451
Now--

479
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,182
That looks like--

480
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:00,723
What is that, man?

481
00:31:00,824 --> 00:31:01,425
What is that?

482
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:01,914
Take that back.

483
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,118
That's not your...plate!

484
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,324
Come on, it's for the Winters.

485
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:04,985
Uh, take it, take it.

486
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:05,761
Do another one.

487
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:08,297
Tell Mr. Winters
I love his shoes, okay?

488
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:09,592
Don't give me that look, okay?

489
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,827
I like what you're
doing to this place, huh?

490
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:12,799
Oh, you like it?

491
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:13,561
Kitchen's yours.

492
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:14,569
When do you start?

493
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,163
How about a package deal?

494
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:20,437
You looking?

495
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:22,574
I know this
guy'll never come down,

496
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,780
but if you're looking
we could use someone.

497
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:26,383
If he recommends you.

498
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:27,714
I recommend her.

499
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:30,883
Ring me on Monday.

500
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:31,716
Hm?

501
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,317
Okay...I'm gonna let you guys eat.

502
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:35,687
Thank you.

503
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:36,520
I will, I'll call you.

504
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:37,461
Okay.

505
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:38,428
It was nice to meet you.

506
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:40,156
It was nice to meet you too,
darling.

507
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:41,829
Frannie.

508
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,159
Gracias.

509
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,661
De Nada.

510
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:46,970
See?

511
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,029
That was easy.

512
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:51,774
Lemon?

513
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,462
What are you doing
the rest of the day?

514
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,591
Dealing with this.

515
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,866
Do you want to go to
the beach with me?

516
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:25,506
I want to show you something.

517
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:28,601
Okay.

518
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,841
But I want to get out of
these crazy clothes.

519
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,107
We can go like this.

520
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:38,816
Why not?

521
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:43,989
Uh, but first, uh, I,

522
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:46,654
I have to go back to the
restaurant to get my wallet.

523
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:54,764
Pacing...yourself there, Kevin?

524
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,472
Well, these were
the only dishes at my station.

525
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:03,172
Pepito!

526
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,015
Did you have a good day off?

527
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,278
Hey, Manny!

528
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:13,084
Your brother's back.

529
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,125
Hey, El Caya!

530
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,456
Where you been, man?

531
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:17,926
Was it busy, man?

532
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,792
Oh, man, it's been crazy.

533
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:21,294
We did the best we could.

534
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,128
Two tables walked out on us.

535
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,397
You just sneaking in and out?

536
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:29,571
You weren't gonna say hello?

537
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,005
Uh, I just came to
pick up my phone, Manny.

538
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:32,868
Yes.

539
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,800
You forgot your phone.

540
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,105
I called you.

541
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:39,148
Mama called you, too.

542
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,212
I found the time to call you
even though we...

543
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:44,446
...were short one chef
during the lunch rush hours.

544
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:45,782
Where were you, Jose, huh?

545
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,561
You went outside?

546
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:00,029
Carlos took the trash outside.

547
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,635
He didn't see you outside.

548
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,764
How far outside did you go,
Hermano?

549
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,568
Acapulco?

550
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:05,266
Where were you?

551
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:06,468
We wereһwe were worried.

552
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,511
We were busy and
you bailed out on us.

553
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,671
You abandoned your own flesh and blood.

554
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:14,281
Here.

555
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:14,917
Here.

556
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:17,282
You can make this up to me by,
by, by cleaning up this mess.

557
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:18,080
You're lucky I don't,

558
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,282
I don't cut the whole staff and
let you do it by yourself.

559
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:21,591
Manny. Manny.

560
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,018
I, I have to do this now...man.

561
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:25,594
What?

562
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:26,287
I have to go.

563
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:27,330
What?

564
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:28,590
What's everybody staring at?

565
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:29,222
We have work...

566
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:29,993
You!

567
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,796
In my office, right now!

568
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:43,743
I called everyone.

569
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,246
I called Mama, Papa.

570
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:47,841
You left all of us
when you walked out of

571
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:49,213
that door with
your new friend.

572
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:51,117
Two tabl-- Hm.

573
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:55,283
Two tables walked out
on us today, Jose.

574
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:55,983
Two.

575
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:57,117
That's never happened before.

576
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:57,852
Never.

577
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,691
This is, this is bad business, Jose.

578
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:01,162
Bad business.

579
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:03,594
Everything to you is business.

580
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,929
I'm sure everyone picked up
the slack and got you...

581
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:08,629
...and your restaurant
through the day.

582
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:11,138
But what are you doing for them?

583
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:13,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

584
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,938
Am I hearing this correctly?

585
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,774
A-Ask Amelia.

586
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:17,939
She's been here the whole time.

587
00:35:18,014 --> 00:35:18,912
She has four kids

588
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:20,643
and commutes from
the Bronx every day.

589
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:21,809
She has three kids, Manny.

590
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:22,715
She has kids.

591
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:23,775
See?

592
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:25,452
You don't even know her.

593
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,949
And you're giving the Amelia speech to me?

594
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:35,656
you're just leaving for
some late, drunk waitress?

595
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,063
When did this happen?

596
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,996
You fired a pregnant woman, Manny.

597
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,747
I don't know why she was late,
all I know is she was late,

598
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:55,749
all the time.

599
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,284
Did you ever stop to ask?

600
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:02,121
I mean, do you know anything about
any of these people, besides Amelia?

601
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,384
Do you know that Henri the bartender

602
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,520
is making twice as much as
Pepito, my cook?

603
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:12,428
Why does Kevin always get better
stations than Margarita?

604
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,475
Enter.

605
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:28,784
What is wrong with you?!

606
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:31,319
How can you talk to me like that
in front of my employees?!

607
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:32,217
What is wrong with me?!

608
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:33,517
What is it with you?

609
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:40,662
Carlos, Carlos, one of your people
he's below minimum wage, man!

610
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,459
Why is that, huh?

611
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:46,258
Oh, he doesn't have papers,
so you can get away with it?

612
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,974
It's all about you, man!

613
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,075
Jose?

614
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:06,816
This is the same pot you bought
four years ago when you opened.

615
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:09,224
It scorches because it's old.

616
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,117
Buy another one.

617
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:18,390
You can clean out
your locker, too.

618
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,502
I'm done.

619
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:26,170
And call Mama.

620
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:28,209
She's worried.

621
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,011
What're you trying to do?

622
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,069
Are you all right?

623
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,036
What happened?

624
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:05,478
Let's go.

625
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,142
Don't tell me he fired you?

626
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:12,353
I can't believe him!

627
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:13,046
He's such a piece of

628
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,818
He's been good to me.

629
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:22,322
All right.

630
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,726
Well, I guess we did ruin his day.

631
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,969
I got some things for the trip..

632
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,998
Let's go.

633
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:29,963
I could really use a bath,
and some Marvin Gaye.

634
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,930
You can take a bath at my parents'.

635
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,595
They may have Tito Puente,
I don't know about Marvin Gaye.

636
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:36,764
I thought we were
going to the beach.

637
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,364
They live on the beach.

638
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,601
Don't worry.

639
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:41,371
Oh, I don't worry.

640
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:45,508
I used to worry,
but then I did a little research

641
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:50,978
and I found out that
ten out of ten people...

642
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:54,383
Do you think that
this is all there is?

643
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,784
That we only live once?

644
00:39:56,926 --> 00:40:01,363
Well, so far I haven't met anyone
who's lived twice.

645
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,276
- Can I ask you a question?
- No.

646
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,307
All right.

647
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:19,907
I'm just kidding.

648
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:20,784
What?

649
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,149
Nothing.

650
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:25,186
Just ask.

651
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:31,724
Have you thought about adoption?

652
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:36,924
Do we have to talk about
this right now?

653
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,001
No.

654
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:53,907
I can't carry a
living thing inside my body

655
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:56,315
for nine months,
and then, what?

656
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:59,581
Leave it on a doorstep in
a basket for some stranger?

657
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,654
To me, that's worse than anything.

658
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,286
It doesn't have to be a stranger.

659
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:11,496
So then I just start
calling up relatives?

660
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,292
My relative?

661
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:16,035
Hey, Mom, I haven't
talked to you in four years

662
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,630
but I got something for you.

663
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:23,540
Or how about this?

664
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:25,806
You can have it.

665
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:29,947
I bet Manny could
teach it a thing or two.

666
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,288
The Suviran boys can
raise little Nina...

667
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:34,015
...because right now,

668
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,321
you're probably the only person
in the world I trust.

669
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,501
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

670
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,543
Nina, Nina.

671
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:29,610
Wait, wait.

672
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,078
Hold the train.

673
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:18,433
It's beautiful.

674
00:43:32,187 --> 00:43:33,347
What did he say?

675
00:43:33,588 --> 00:43:35,647
He said you look like a Mexican.

676
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:37,952
Oh, thank you.

677
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:49,834
He's inviting us for dinner.

678
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:51,528
Yo entiendo.

679
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:53,706
Should we stay?

680
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,761
We're going to help him
plant these trees, all right?

681
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:48,594
What did he say?

682
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:51,194
He asked if you liked flowers.

683
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:52,400
Oh!

684
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:54,299
Yes.

685
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:55,232
I do.

686
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:56,861
I love flowers.

687
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:25,816
Okay, what just happened?

688
00:46:28,129 --> 00:46:29,323
What?

689
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:32,530
Nothing.

690
00:46:34,402 --> 00:46:35,562
Wow!

691
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,934
Oh, man.

692
00:46:42,544 --> 00:46:43,841
Does it run?

693
00:46:44,946 --> 00:46:46,174
Let's see.

694
00:46:48,116 --> 00:46:50,277
My dad used to have an old Ford.

695
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,249
Wow!

696
00:46:57,826 --> 00:46:59,191
Is it yours?

697
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:01,153
Yeah.

698
00:47:01,396 --> 00:47:02,385
Well....

699
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:06,725
I got the scarf.

700
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:09,429
We should take a road trip
across the country.

701
00:47:11,072 --> 00:47:13,131
Doesn,t look like
you drive it much.

702
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:15,073
I used to.

703
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,511
When was the last time
you drove this thing?

704
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:23,608
The last time I drove it
I went to jail.

705
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:30,888
Car.

706
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:32,726
You went to jail?

707
00:47:33,028 --> 00:47:34,427
For what?

708
00:47:35,997 --> 00:47:39,933
Five years ago, I was on my way
to a press conference.

709
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:44,331
I had just signed a contract with
a new soccer team.

710
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:47,234
You played soccer?

711
00:47:49,144 --> 00:47:51,271
Everything happened so fast.

712
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:52,938
Two, one....

713
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:54,982
Ready or not, here I come.

714
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,677
Cheese!

715
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:01,285
Sweetie this is the part
where you're supposed to hide.

716
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:11,762
Luchee I can see you.

717
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,561
- I see you.
- I see you.

718
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:18,900
We're gonna play this game a lot
when we go to your grandmother's.

719
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:22,602
And she has horses
and pigs and cows.

720
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,008
Moo, that's right.

721
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,984
Okay, Luchee, ready to play again?

722
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:35,746
- Yes.
- Okay.

723
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:38,457
I'm gonna count.

724
00:48:42,664 --> 00:48:50,002
Nine...eight...seven....

725
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,305
Mommy!

726
00:48:58,913 --> 00:49:00,904
Four, three...

727
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,776
...one!

728
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,873
Where are you?

729
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,483
Luchee?

730
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,120
Where are you?

731
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,054
I'm coming.

732
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:52,991
Luce?

733
00:49:56,037 --> 00:49:57,197
Luchee!

734
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:11,574
Luchee!

735
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:24,426
Standing in the middle of the street,
looking down at her little body.

736
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,000
Somebody call an ambulance!

737
00:50:31,172 --> 00:50:33,299
Somebody help me!

738
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,433
I live with it every day, Nina

739
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:39,409
You!!

740
00:50:39,647 --> 00:50:41,342
It was you!

741
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,793
I can still hear her crying

742
00:50:57,899 --> 00:51:00,527
and screaming for God to
give her daughter back.

743
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:01,226
Why?!

744
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:04,064
You killed her!

745
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:14,608
When I saw her mother holding,
holding her dead child....

746
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:37,994
I was convicted on
involuntary manslaughter.

747
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,035
My brother Manny was there
all the time with me.

748
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:49,579
What about her family?

749
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,051
She was a single mother.

750
00:51:53,755 --> 00:51:58,954
They took four years of my life,
and I took everything she had.

751
00:51:59,694 --> 00:52:03,130
I tried to meet with her several times,
but she refused.

752
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:08,268
I know all she sees in me is
the one who killed her little baby.

753
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:12,896
- But it was an accident.
- It doesn't matter, Nina.

754
00:52:13,107 --> 00:52:14,369
It doesn't matter.

755
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:17,205
What matters is that
I took her daughter's life.

756
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:23,341
Hey, bro!

757
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:25,278
Que paso?

758
00:52:25,486 --> 00:52:27,283
And Nina, all right.

759
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,985
Are you guys ready to
meet the love of my life?

760
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:35,988
I think this is it, hermano.

761
00:52:36,164 --> 00:52:37,927
I'm going to marry her.

762
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:42,992
How long have you guys
been together?

763
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:45,105
A week.

764
00:52:57,418 --> 00:52:59,318
They want you in the kitchen.

765
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:01,888
All right.

766
00:53:11,432 --> 00:53:13,093
I promised you a bath.

767
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:33,411
It's good to see you again.

768
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:35,684
Nina, right?

769
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:36,917
Right.

770
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:40,289
So the two of you
took the day off?

771
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:46,166
I was kind of fired today.

772
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:48,363
Yeah, I heard.

773
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:49,664
I spoke to Manny.

774
00:53:50,538 --> 00:53:51,732
I'm sorry.

775
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,872
You shouldn't take it
personally though.

776
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:00,703
Do you need to borrow any clothes,
because you could try some of mine.

777
00:54:00,815 --> 00:54:02,476
No, thank you.

778
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,379
Everything I need
is right in here.

779
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:06,613
I just have to freshen up a bit.

780
00:58:51,939 --> 00:58:56,399
Jose, Nina, Veronica
''Suviran,'' mi novia.

781
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,172
- Nice to meet you.
- Veronica Kustella.

782
00:58:59,346 --> 00:59:01,314
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

783
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:02,783
Novia?

784
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:04,416
Novia means girlfriend.

785
00:59:04,618 --> 00:59:06,813
Futura esposa
means future wife.

786
00:59:07,221 --> 00:59:08,882
Eduardo is loco.

787
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:10,991
He's trying to teach me Spanish.

788
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:13,784
- Some tequila?
- No.

789
00:59:14,028 --> 00:59:15,052
No, no, no.

790
00:59:15,129 --> 00:59:16,357
Family custom, yes.

791
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:21,658
- Jose?
- No, gracias.

792
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:23,100
Come on, hermano.

793
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:26,062
Veronica?

794
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,236
Thank you.

795
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:33,446
Are we going to toast?

796
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:38,312
- Shall we say grace?
- Want to say grace?

797
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:47,488
Veronica and I are going to say Grace.

798
00:59:47,862 --> 00:59:49,193
You ready?

799
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:50,854
Repeat after me.

800
00:59:57,538 --> 00:59:59,768
This is for Veronica.

801
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:01,201
Thank you.

802
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:02,309
Sorry.

803
01:00:21,262 --> 01:00:22,490
Great job!

804
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:25,730
Now we can toast.

805
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:44,974
Do you like oysters?

806
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,385
That was good, Dad!

807
01:00:51,225 --> 01:00:52,988
I love oysters.

808
01:00:54,428 --> 01:00:57,659
One time I dove into this river,
in my ranch in Mexico...

809
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:03,368
...and when I dove in my legs
were sticking out of the water...

810
01:01:03,437 --> 01:01:05,735
...and my whole head
was stuck in mud.

811
01:01:06,106 --> 01:01:08,597
I found out the river
was only three feet deep.

812
01:01:08,776 --> 01:01:11,574
Manny had to come to my rescue
and pull me out by my legs...

813
01:01:11,645 --> 01:01:15,046
...and when he pulled me out
an oyster shell cut my arm.

814
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:17,416
stitches.

815
01:01:17,785 --> 01:01:19,980
If I had moved my arm
inches to the right...

816
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:22,918
...this scar would
have been right on my face.

817
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:25,915
And beautiful Veronica
wouldn't be here.

818
01:01:26,527 --> 01:01:27,960
Why wouldn't I be here?

819
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:30,858
Because I wouldn't be as handsome.

820
01:01:39,373 --> 01:01:43,139
Anyway, so, Manny fired you
because you were late?

821
01:01:46,347 --> 01:01:48,747
And, you, you walked out on him, today?

822
01:01:57,625 --> 01:02:00,116
Manny fired me too,
before I even started working.

823
01:02:00,194 --> 01:02:01,058
You never showed up for work.

824
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:02,958
Manny needs to learn how to cook, anyway.

825
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:06,488
He's too busy cracking
the whip like El General.

826
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:09,665
El General up on his fine horse.

827
01:02:09,803 --> 01:02:12,431
We should get a statue and put
it in front of the restaurant.

828
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,369
You should take Manny as an example.

829
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:16,136
He's worked hard all his life.

830
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:18,234
He started from zero
and look where he is now.

831
01:02:18,712 --> 01:02:19,872
Unlike you.

832
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:40,792
I don't normally share this,

833
01:02:40,901 --> 01:02:45,304
but in the early years,
we couldn't have children.

834
01:02:46,573 --> 01:02:47,870
We tried.

835
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:49,304
We tried hard.

836
01:02:49,443 --> 01:02:51,070
We did everything we could, but--

837
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:54,239
Mom, don't mention such things
in front of the children.

838
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,484
And then when we were about to
give up one of his cousins

839
01:03:03,624 --> 01:03:06,184
back in Puerto Rico
was a social worker...

840
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:10,593
...and before we knew it we
had adopted this beautiful baby.

841
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:13,690
He was not even three years old.

842
01:03:14,535 --> 01:03:16,503
A really precious boy.

843
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:21,767
I think the only difference
between my three sons

844
01:03:21,976 --> 01:03:24,968
is the way
that Manny came to us.

845
01:04:18,899 --> 01:04:20,161
Soccer.

846
01:04:26,306 --> 01:04:28,103
I don't play soccer.

847
01:04:28,275 --> 01:04:28,969
You play soccer?

848
01:04:59,706 --> 01:05:01,173
I'm sorry.

849
01:05:56,096 --> 01:05:58,963
He's saying you can't play soccer
without passion.

850
01:06:01,735 --> 01:06:05,466
This man has never wanted to
learn English in his whole life.

851
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:06,596
Have you?

852
01:06:08,709 --> 01:06:12,645
I understand what he's saying.

853
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:16,913
He understands a lot
more than you think.

854
01:06:17,017 --> 01:06:18,075
Don't you?

855
01:06:36,803 --> 01:06:38,270
Well, it's getting late.

856
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:40,632
I need to get back to the city.

857
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:44,635
You, Jose, eh, stay here.

858
01:06:45,312 --> 01:06:47,041
You see how he speaks English?

859
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:49,376
He doesn't because he's lazy.

860
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:50,609
But he's right.

861
01:06:51,151 --> 01:06:52,982
You should stay here and rest.

862
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:57,889
Thank you, but I, I really can't.

863
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:14,763
Take care.

864
01:07:42,169 --> 01:07:43,636
I need to go home.

865
01:07:46,173 --> 01:07:47,868
Let's go to the beach first.

866
01:07:47,975 --> 01:07:49,374
And then we'll go from there.

867
01:07:52,512 --> 01:07:53,843
Sure.

868
01:07:58,685 --> 01:07:59,947
This is for you.

869
01:08:37,124 --> 01:08:40,355
I never saw anything like this...before.

870
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:41,858
My father made them.

871
01:08:42,062 --> 01:08:44,963
I mean, I think he has
too much time on his hands.

872
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:47,460
I just adore him.

873
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:51,197
He is so great.

874
01:08:53,106 --> 01:08:54,505
Is he from Mexico?

875
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:55,404
No.

876
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:58,308
My father is from Puerto Rico
and my mother is from Mexico.

877
01:08:58,378 --> 01:09:01,347
So I am a Rico-Mex.

878
01:09:01,882 --> 01:09:04,817
It means half Puerto Rican,
half Mexican.

879
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:07,046
It's all the same to me.

880
01:09:08,021 --> 01:09:10,421
So is it always like that?

881
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,958
I mean, did you grow up with that?

882
01:09:14,227 --> 01:09:15,251
What?

883
01:09:15,395 --> 01:09:18,262
Joy? Love?

884
01:09:19,433 --> 01:09:20,991
Oh, that's nothing.

885
01:09:21,268 --> 01:09:25,534
I mean, when my whole family
gets together, whew, muchacha!

886
01:09:26,173 --> 01:09:28,300
I mean, it's really crazy.

887
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:32,572
The food, the music, the dancing,
the salsa, merengue.

888
01:09:34,448 --> 01:09:35,745
It's beautiful.

889
01:09:43,256 --> 01:09:46,885
What does Manny feel about people
knowing he's adopted?

890
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:49,526
To us, it doesn't make a difference.

891
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:58,402
You are seriously lucky.

892
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,738
You have a good family.

893
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:08,642
How about your family?

894
01:10:08,782 --> 01:10:11,751
My dad passed away
when I was twelve.

895
01:10:12,252 --> 01:10:14,447
No brothers or sisters.

896
01:10:15,322 --> 01:10:17,256
So that's my family.

897
01:10:27,934 --> 01:10:29,367
Here.

898
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,998
Thank you.

899
01:10:35,108 --> 01:10:36,598
What about your mom?

900
01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:43,807
After he died she just
kind of sat on the couch

901
01:10:43,884 --> 01:10:47,251
with the remote and
never moved on.

902
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:49,486
I raised myself.

903
01:10:50,157 --> 01:10:51,886
And her.

904
01:10:52,325 --> 01:10:54,919
How was it dealing with
your dad's death?

905
01:10:56,096 --> 01:10:57,688
I don't know.

906
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,466
I don't remember what the
twelve year old in me was feeling.

907
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,811
I think that my mom
took it so hard

908
01:11:12,913 --> 01:11:16,849
that I didn't get the chance to
grieve, in a healthy way.

909
01:11:17,484 --> 01:11:20,715
It was like I had to
take care of her, you know?

910
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:23,218
At first,
it brought us closer together

911
01:11:23,356 --> 01:11:26,086
but I eventually turned into
the typical teenager

912
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:29,890
and all that grief
turned into resentment.

913
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:37,031
One night,
I got stoned out of my mind.

914
01:11:37,604 --> 01:11:39,663
I went home, walked in her room

915
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:45,644
and there she was watching TV.

916
01:11:46,213 --> 01:11:51,845
I looked at her and
started laughing at her.

917
01:11:53,487 --> 01:11:56,047
Pointing right in her face.

918
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:04,920
She just sat there.

919
01:12:15,308 --> 01:12:17,674
And I started to cry.

920
01:12:24,117 --> 01:12:30,750
I told her how much
I miss my dad, too.

921
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:37,489
That I know that she's in pain
where I was in pain, too.

922
01:12:42,369 --> 01:12:46,567
And it was like for the
first time she saw me again.

923
01:12:54,447 --> 01:12:59,578
She stood up and held me.

924
01:13:10,864 --> 01:13:12,798
Then I got the munchies.

925
01:13:15,402 --> 01:13:19,168
And we ate some doughnuts and
talked about him all night.

926
01:13:23,443 --> 01:13:28,380
The next morning, I woke up
and felt like I had a mom again,

927
01:13:28,715 --> 01:13:35,052
but it was too late.

928
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:09,179
When I was eighteen,
my mom held out her hand.

929
01:14:10,256 --> 01:14:14,022
She waved her wedding ring
at me this tiny stone

930
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:16,688
my dad probably
got at a pawn shop.

931
01:14:17,998 --> 01:14:20,899
She said, ''You need to
get you one of these.''

932
01:14:22,736 --> 01:14:26,069
She loved him so much
she never took that ring off.

933
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:30,339
That's what I want, Jose.

934
01:14:31,344 --> 01:14:35,110
I want to bring a child
into this world out of love...

935
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:38,144
...with a man who's
gonna take care of us.

936
01:14:40,987 --> 01:14:42,921
I don't have that.

937
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:50,060
I can't have this baby
and watch it suffer with me.

938
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:58,797
I don't know what I'm doing.

939
01:15:05,178 --> 01:15:08,204
I'm gonna need a friend next week.

940
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,658
Here.

941
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:37,201
I want you to keep it.

942
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,066
Thank you.

943
01:16:43,443 --> 01:16:45,104
You're gonna come with me, right?

944
01:16:48,748 --> 01:16:51,216
You know what,
don't worry about it.

945
01:16:51,451 --> 01:16:52,918
I'll be fine.

946
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:55,554
I'll call you.

947
01:16:58,424 --> 01:16:59,857
I'll call you, okay?

948
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:32,441
Let's talk about the salmon,
the special I want to come up with.

949
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:35,971
Asparagus, mushroom, cactus.

950
01:19:36,115 --> 01:19:40,074
I'm gonna throw in some avocado,
some mango.

951
01:19:40,186 --> 01:19:41,448
Manny.

952
01:19:44,223 --> 01:19:45,986
You're gonna do what?

953
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:09,740
Okay, let's go.

954
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:19,484
You can always take a piece of
the ocean with you.

955
01:21:19,685 --> 01:21:20,583
How?

956
01:21:20,686 --> 01:21:25,851
When you take a seashell home,
you put it right to your ears

957
01:21:26,059 --> 01:21:27,856
and you can hear the ocean.

958
01:21:29,028 --> 01:21:30,359
You want to try it?

959
01:21:31,064 --> 01:21:32,053
Sure.

960
01:21:32,165 --> 01:21:33,359
Okay.

961
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:35,791
One, two, three.

962
01:21:37,804 --> 01:21:39,931
Here. Try.

963
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,609
I can't hear it yet.

964
01:21:45,711 --> 01:21:48,578
Oh, well,
you're at the ocean.

965
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:51,882
But when you leave the ocean,
then you can hear it.

966
01:21:57,323 --> 01:21:59,917
- I can hear it now.
- You can hear now?

967
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,467
Perfect.

968
01:22:17,143 --> 01:22:20,635
- How do I look?
- You look beautiful.

969
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:34,320
Here she comes.

970
01:22:40,933 --> 01:22:42,423
Okay. Let's go.

971
01:23:35,555 --> 01:23:38,285
Do you know who I am?

972
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:41,255
You're my mama.

973
01:23:52,004 --> 01:23:54,438
I brought this for you.

974
01:24:00,546 --> 01:24:04,209
That was the last gift
my father gave to me.

975
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:13,785
Thank you.

976
01:24:15,494 --> 01:24:17,086
You're welcome.

977
01:24:29,442 --> 01:24:31,171
Thank you.

978
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:33,005
You're welcome.

979
01:24:40,753 --> 01:24:44,621
Jose thank you so much.

980
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:48,050
I'm sorry.

981
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,458
Thank you. Thank you.
