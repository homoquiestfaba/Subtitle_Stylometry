2
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:14,067
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,233
- Perfect.

4
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,808
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,010
(sighs)

6
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,593
(upbeat music)

7
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,763
- (sighs) I want a divorce.

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,153
- You're awake?

9
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:15,180
You know those guys are customers,

10
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,550
I have to show them a good time.

11
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,293
- This is of no interest to me.

12
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:23,250
- We ate, we played cards,

13
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,430
the card game turned into a crap game.

14
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,473
- I can smell her.

15
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,893
It is not a pleasant smell.

16
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,743
It smells like a wet poodle.

17
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,220
- I don't know how to respond to that.

18
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,630
- So I'm wrong?

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,680
- Yeah, you're wrong.

20
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:44,943
- Am I?

21
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,180
- (pauses) Yes, you are.

22
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,073
- Why the pause?

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,963
- For emphasis.

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,690
- I'll show you pause for emphasis.

25
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,120
I want (pauses) a divorce.

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,840
- Yeah, right, divorce.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,141
That's what you really wanna do, right?

28
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,861
That's what you really wanna
do, you wanna get a divorce?

29
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,520
- No, what I really want
is to cut your balls off

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,860
and feed them to the dog next door,

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
that's what I'd really like to do.

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,818
- I thought you liked that dog.

33
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,310
(sighs)

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,167
Let's just, let's just go to bed

35
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,260
and talk about it in the morning.

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,840
- Do you know I don't
think that you have made

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,070
one single decision your entire adult life

38
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,770
that you have been satisfied with.

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,869
- What do you want from me?

40
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:32,593
- (sighs) I told you.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,853
I want a divorce.

42
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,920
- I don't want a divorce.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,570
- You don't, (scoffs)

44
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,280
George, you don't know what you want.

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,980
You only know what you don't want.

46
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:46,983
- I love you.

47
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:49,000
- I love you too, George.

48
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:52,113
So what's your point?

49
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,786
(upbeat orchestral music)

50
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:13,849
(upbeat opera music)

51
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,979
(dog barking in distance)

52
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,500
- I'm Mr. Tardy on a school night.

53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,333
- That's fine.

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,413
Just next time call.

55
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,254
- Night, night, kid, night.

56
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,470
Take it easy.

57
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,303
- Hey sweetie.

58
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,370
So did you catch anything?

59
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,620
- Some, some little ones.

60
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,260
- Do you wanna come in,
get a drink, or something?

61
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,760
- No, no, it's okay, I'm fine.

62
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,180
- Why do I feel so terrible about this?

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,013
- You shouldn't.

64
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,150
- I do.

65
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,490
- Well you're making a terrible
mistake, let's face it.

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,430
- Okay.

67
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,610
- This is a big step.

68
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,770
- Oh yeah, I really appreciate
that coming from you.

69
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,020
- I want you to be happy.

70
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:53,982
You happy?

71
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:54,815
- Yeah, I am.

72
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,923
- Well,

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,750
you could be making a big mistake.

74
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,880
- I gotta go.

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,193
- All right, all right,
all right, I'm sorry.

76
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:05,690
I got a wedding present for you.

77
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,523
- Oh God.

78
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,287
- Come on, it's just a
little, it's four words.

79
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,940
You say them to yourself whenever
you're feeling bad for me,

80
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,830
and then you'll be okay.

81
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,283
- What are these magic words?

82
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,030
- He had his chance.

83
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,083
- (inhales) I hate you.

84
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,920
- That's three words.

85
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,870
That's even better.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,460
Really.

87
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,310
- Go.

88
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,161
- Okay.

89
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,161
- Bye.
- Bye.

90
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,731
(piano music)

91
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,630
- So I says, I'll tell
you what, stupid ass.

92
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,330
You come in here, I'm
going the fuck outside.

93
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,930
I don't care, nobody listens to me anyway.

94
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,393
- Look who it is?

95
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,023
- Oh Jesus Christ.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
The prodigal son of bitch.

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Where the hell you been?

98
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,810
- I've been around.

99
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,260
- You ain't been around here.

100
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,640
Marty here tells me you're good.

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,473
- I'm good.

102
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,630
- Don't lie to me, you son of a bitch.

103
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:12,907
- I'd never lie to you.

104
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,000
- He tells me your
brother sold the business.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
- Going off to be a big time lawyer.

106
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
- That right, George,
your brother going off

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,132
to be a big time lawyer?

108
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,153
- Yeah, well,

109
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:25,750
I guess it turns out
we were a lawyer short.

110
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,723
- Yeah. (scoffs)

111
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,096
What are you gonna do?

112
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:32,530
- I'm gonna stay.

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,510
- You're gonna stay with the business?

114
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,400
- Yeah, that's what I said.

115
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,233
- As what?

116
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,490
- As an employee.

117
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,573
- Jesus.

118
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,200
Is there a future in that?

119
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,860
- I hope so, yeah.

120
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,693
- I hope so too,

121
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:50,517
because that's all you
got is your future, right?

122
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:51,700
- And your past.

123
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,943
You have your past.

124
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:55,310
- No, you don't have your past, stupid.

125
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,343
You already had it.

126
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:58,278
You have your future.

127
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,282

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,330

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,770
Hey, Bibi?

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,790
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,423
- You never looked better.

161
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:51,621
- Oh, I don't know, George.

162
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,180
I mean, you should've seen me yesterday.

163
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,330
Or the day before that.

164
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,420
Or the day before that.

165
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:03,250
- I think I owe you an apology.

166
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,893
- Mm, that's all right.

167
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,963
Why apologize?

168
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,610
You're no different that any other man.

169
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,347
I know that, and I think you know that,

170
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:14,747
and that's gotta hurt,

171
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:16,247

175
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,810
- [George] Yeah, time flies.

176
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,060
- [Bibi] Does it, George?

177
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,810
- [George] Well sometimes,
yeah, it really does.

178
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,310
- [Bibi] Sometimes I feel
like I'm always waiting.

179
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:44,500
- [George] For what?

180
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,070
- Beats me.

181
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,280
Sometimes I can't help thinking that

182
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,773
maybe that bus isn't coming back.

183
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:53,680

Or maybe the bus came by

186
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,283
and I just watched it ride away.

187
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,124
- Yeah.

188
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:07,843
- Do you ever think of
it like that, George?

189
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:08,773
- Like a bus?

190
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,423
- I'm making an analogy, George.

191
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:15,816
(sighs)

192
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,760
- I know, I know.

193
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,260
- Do you know what an analogy is?

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,313
- Yeah, I know what an
analogy is, I just, I just,

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,382
you know, I never thought
of it just that way.

196
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,357
- Yeah.

197
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:28,170
- But I know what you mean.

198
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,003
- It's okay, George.

199
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,836
- I know.

200
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,930
- I know, but you don't have to see things

201
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,643
the way I do all the time.

202
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,469
(exhales)

203
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,672
- Right.

204
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:45,583
I don't blame you.

205
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,710
Am I arguing with you, Pete?

206
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,543
Yo, dad.

207
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
I agree, Pete, I agree.

208
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,760
You can't make potato
soup without potatoes.

209
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,830
Potatoes are key to that particular dish.

210
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,123
Hang on, I'm checking.

211
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,740
Oh, you're right, goddamn it, I'm sorry.

212
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,367
Let me fix it.

213
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,030
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,450
No, no, no, no, you can finish,
I thought you were finished.

215
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,500
- Let me talk to him, let me talk to him.

216
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,272
Pilar?

217
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:16,375
Pil?

218
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,850
How the hell are you doing?

219
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,410
How are you, it's me, George.

220
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,560
Yeah, yeah, the good brother.

221
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,393
What's the problem,

222
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:25,040
we kill a busboy in the alley, or what?

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,100
Yeah, didn't he say that
he'd take care of it, huh?

224
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,670
Well okay, come on,
well what should we do,

225
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,080
should we kill ourselves?

226
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,120
Maybe that's it, maybe
we should hang ourselves.

227
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,150
I'm gonna hang my, I'm gonna
let my brother hang himself.

228
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,029
You know what?

229
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm gonna have him hang himself first.

230
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
- Dad, the phone!

231
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,060
- Would you do me a
favor and spare my father

232
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,790
so there'll be someone left
for my mother to annoy?

233
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,610
Didn't he say that he'd fix it?

234
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,443
- He's in a meeting.

235
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:47,610
- What's your problem?

236
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,370
We're both in the service industry, okay?

237
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,837
Yeah, I know that the
customer's always right,

238
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,590
but he doesn't have to be
such an asshole about it.

239
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,590
Yeah, well fuck you!

240
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,530
Fuck you, the potatoes are on their way.

241
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,970
Fuck you.

242
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,220
Okay, say hello to Marie.

243
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,980
I still gotta live with this guy.

244
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,440
Okay, every day.

245
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,273
Every day.

246
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:11,113
- You got psycho on line one.

247
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,829
Is she back in the picture now?

248
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:14,662
- I'll take it outside.

249
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,524
- She's psycho.

250
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:18,753
(screeches) eek, eek, eek!

251
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:20,530
- What the hell is going on here?

252
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,000
- That you heard?

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,990
I should get a phone that
makes that kind of noise

254
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,790
so you'll answer it once in a while.

255
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,373
- Hello.

256
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,330
- I know what you're thinking,

257
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,660
here we go again with
the crazy lady, right?

258
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,817
- I wasn't, I wasn't thinking that.

259
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,460
- I'm having a little crisis here.

260
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,190
- What's the crisis?

261
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,032
- Forget it.

262
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:42,330
- No, no, really, I'm
waiting to hear the crisis.

263
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,540
- I hear it in your voice.

264
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,963
- Look, I just,

265
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,730
what's the crisis?

266
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,810
- Remember I told you
about that job interview

267
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,510
I had today that I was very excited about?

268
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,550
- Mm-hmm, job went away?

269
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,153
- My car won't start!

270
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,003
- Does it do anything?

271
00:12:57,003 --> 00:13:00,034
- It won't start, George,
what else is it gonna do?

272
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,163
- Well did you pump it?

273
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:02,800
- Yes, I pumped it.

274
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,640
- It's fuel injected, you're
not supposed to pump it.

275
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,350
- Okay, then I didn't pump it.

276
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,549
Look, George, I really,
really want this job.

277
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:10,865
- You know, if you called a cab

278
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:12,470
he could probably get there

279
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,180
quicker than I could from here, I mean.

280
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,540
- Fine, I'll call a cab.

281
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
- No, what I'm trying to
say is from where I am,

282
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,810
by the time I got there,

283
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,638
a cab would get you there a lot quicker.

284
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,630
- Fine, that is fine.

285
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,900
You know what?

286
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,840
- Bibi, please.

287
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,232
- If you had half a
brain, or half a heart,

288
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,530
or an ounce of common sense,

289
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,635
you'd realize that I could use
a little moral support here

290
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:37,793
as much as some stupid, fucking ride.

291
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:41,690
But, you know what, I could
probably get more compassion

292
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,590
from a fucking cab driver
who's a total fucking stranger

293
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,033
than I can from a man who was
inside of me not 12 hours ago.

294
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,533
(honking)

295
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,366
Hello.

296
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,563
(honking)

297
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,830
He hated me.

298
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,760
- That's impossible.

299
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,348
- No, after every single thing
I'd say, he'd say, "Really."

300
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:04,990
After every single answer I gave

301
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,780
to his stupid, fucking
questions, he'd say, "Really."

302
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,504
Like isn't that odd, or
why on God's green earth

303
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:14,620
would you say something
ridiculous like that?

304
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,793
I hate him, he's evil.

305
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,660
You know, I have something to offer,

306
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,303
would somebody please tell me what it is?

307
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:33,894
(opera music)

308
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,469
Are you listening to me?

309
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:53,420
- Yeah, I hear you.

310
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,200
You're setting off car alarms.

311
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,803
- I want some answers.

312
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,883
- What's the question?

313
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,963
- What color is my parachute?

314
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,060
- Red.

315
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,893
- Why red?

316
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,320
- I don't know, I,

317
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,783
think of you, I think red.

318
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,700
- I like that.

319
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,093
I wonder what the hell it means.

320
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:20,782
- I hear he's seeing Bibi again.

321
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,810
Bibi Cairo.

322
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,310
Great name for a broad.

323
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,460
- She's psycho.

324
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,880
- I'm just talkin' 'bout the name.

325
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,860
- I don't care if her name is Cleopatra.

326
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,370
She's a tumor.

327
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,980
- Have you ever met her?
- I don't have to meet her.

328
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,900
- She's actually a very nice girl.

329
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,860
- You think anyone with
big boobs is a nice girl.

330
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,170
- Roy has big boobs.

331
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,370
I don't think he's a very nice girl.

332
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,980
- She's his fucking ruination.

333
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,813
- Gin.

334
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,670
- You know what your problem is?

335
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,090
You never had a girlfriend.

336
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,950
- I never had a girlfriend?

337
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,990
- Not since you've been married anyway.

338
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,610
- No, not since I've been married.

339
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,690
Maybe that's why I still have a wife.

340
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,940
- I'm not saying it's good or bad,

341
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,040
you just don't know how it
feels, it's a different thing.

342
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,480
- You never played around?

343
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
- No.

344
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,620
- Ever?

345
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,170
- Never.

346
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,473
Sorry to disappoint you.

347
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,770
- Maybe you haven't
met the right girl yet.

348
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,360
- I married her.

349
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,580
- I mean the (pauses) other right girl.

350
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,535
(opera music)

351
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,939
(applause)

352
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,844
(cheering)

353
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,938
(soft music)

354
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:01,053
- (lightly laughs) Go to hell.

355
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,480
Yeah, you heard me, I said, go to hell.

356
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,430
You know that's your trouble.

357
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,880
No one talks to you that way.

358
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:12,388
Oh God, I feel sorry for you.

359
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,536
Why, because it's pathetic.

360
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,953
(soft music)

361
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,573
Of course, I love you.

362
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:24,233
Would I say all this if I didn't love you?

363
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,650
(soft music)

364
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,593
I have to go.

365
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,108
Because, I have to go.

366
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,525
(soft music)

367
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:41,030
(light knocking)

368
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,353
- [Woman] Do you need anything?

369
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,640
- When I said I wanted
to sell the business,

370
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,693
you said, okay, right?

371
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,526
- Right.

372
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,510
- You didn't have to stay.

373
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,930
I got the employment contract

374
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,870
because you said you wanted to stay.

375
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,820
- So.

376
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,703
- So, I don't think you wanna stay.

377
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,610
- Is that the impression I'm giving you?

378
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,563
- Yes, it is.

379
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:12,670
- I think I'm at a crossroads.

380
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,840
- I think you're at an impasse.

381
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,980
- Yeah, what's the difference?

382
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,840
- They're totally different.

383
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,050
- They aren't.

384
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,288
- That's your problem.

385
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,300
You don't know the difference between

386
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,040
a crossroads and an impasse.

387
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,733
- I don't think that's my problem.

388
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,270
- I'd just feel much
better if you had a plan.

389
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:31,850
- I have a plan.

390
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,113
- Fine, what's your plan?

391
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,600
- If I told ya, it might not come true.

392
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,140
- That's a wish.

393
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,313
You can't tell a wish,
you can tell a plan.

394
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,240
- Well I think I got a wish.

395
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,120
- Then you have crap.

396
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,783
A wish without a plan is crap.

397
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,633
You make everything so complicated.

398
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,190
It's very simple, really.

399
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,513
I mean, in the end, what is it you want?

400
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:03,380
- The girl.

401
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,423
- What girl?

402
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,720
- Well that's the happy ending
to all the stories, right?

403
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,773
In the ending, he gets the girl.

404
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,343
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

405
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,850
- It's an analogy.

406
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,448
- For what?

407
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:20,573
- A bus.

408
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:24,073
(upbeat orchestral music)

409
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:36,777
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear a path.

410
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,304
(applause)

411
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,195
- Hello everybody.

412
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,553
Thank you so much.

413
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:46,053
(upbeat orchestral music)

414
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:50,014
It's nice to be back home in Chicago.

415
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,844
Hello, hi there.

416
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:53,932
Thanks for coming out,
it's freezing today.

417
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:57,432
(upbeat orchestral music)

418
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,775
(brakes screeching, car crashing)

419
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:49,275
(upbeat orchestral music)

420
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,250
- What's up with that?

421
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,370
- Absolutely beautiful.

422
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,430
Even Dr. Candate enjoyed it.

423
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,223
- Nice, very nice.

424
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,056
- Thank you.

425
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:05,940
- And he always says the opera
is for snobs and fairies.

426
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,540
- The ballet, I said
that about the ballet.

427
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,630
- Excuse me.

428
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,750
I need to borrow the woman of the hour

429
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,523
for just one moment.

430
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,220
- By all means.

431
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,430
It was such a pleasure to meet you.

432
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,263
- Thank you.

433
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,940
- I never said that about the opera.

434
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,130
It was the ballet.

435
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,550
- Oh, I believe you.

436
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,383
Thank you.

437
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:30,989
(whispers) Thank you, darling.

438
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:31,822
- You're welcome.

439
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,040
I have some people to see,

440
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
if you'll excuse me.

441
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,158
(laughs)

442
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:54,377
- It was you today, oh my God.

443
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:55,943
- It was you.

444
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,210
- You're feeling heavier.

445
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,740
- Thank you, thank you.

446
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,600
- You look great.

447
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,426
It looks wonderful on you.
- I know, I know.

448
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:04,053
Bulky is a good look for me, I know it.

449
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:05,033
Come on, sit.

450
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,763
- I can't believe this.

451
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:12,270
God, it's been a long time.

452
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,650
- I know, I know.

453
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,880
Well you look fantastic.

454
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,000
You know what?

455
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,660
You were just awesome.

456
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,900
Man, your voice, it just filled the room,

457
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,160
every nook and cranny.

458
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,050
- You're so full of shit.

459
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,952
- Well, you know, of course
I've got a hearing problem, but,

460
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:29,060
(laughs)

461
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,700
I still thought it was pretty hot stuff.

462
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,830
- I heard that you got married.

463
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,460
And, uh,

464
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,970
I heard you got divorced.

465
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,173
- I've been busy.

466
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,650
Are you seeing anyone?

467
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,140
- I am.

468
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,030
- Yeah.
- Yes.

469
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,560
You don't know anything about that, huh.

470
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,610
- His name is uh--

471
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,530
- Richard Evans.
- Right, right, right.

472
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,400
- The senator, yeah.
- right, right, right, right.

473
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,973
And he's the senator of,

474
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,203
what's that little speck of a state?

475
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,092
- New Hampshire.
- It's almost in the water.

476
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:02,220
Right, right, right.

477
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,410
You know, that might sink some day,

478
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,630
you better be careful with this guy,

479
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,368
he might not have a job.

480
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:07,850
(laughs)

481
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,800
- Are those for me?

482
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,430
- Yes.

483
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,263
- Thank you.

484
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:14,135
- They're yours.
- Thank you so much.

485
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,241
- You can put them along with
the rest of the deceased,

486
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:17,074
(laughs)

487
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:18,900
because I should've brought candy.

488
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,020
I really should've, because--

489
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,927
- Are you hungry?

490
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:24,200
- Yes.

491
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,450
(upbeat Italian music)

492
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,893
You cold?

493
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:37,726
- No.

494
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,670
- Well your hands are freezing.

495
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,447
- They're always freezing.

496
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:41,460
- I remember, the only
thing that was colder

497
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,730
than your hands were your feet.

498
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,350
- (laughs) Oh my God, you used to make me

499
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,573
wear socks to bed.

500
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:48,350
- Well my feet were afraid of your feet.

501
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,350
- You're such a sick man, you know that?

502
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,011
Oh my God, that's more
beautiful than I remember it.

503
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,020
- We got a lot more buildings now.

504
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,123
- Yes, I see.

505
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,870
- What?

506
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,703
- Nothing.

507
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,023
Just glad to see that you're happy.

508
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,950
- I seem happy?

509
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,783
- Yeah, you do.

510
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,400
- To see you maybe.

511
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:13,973
- (laughs) I'm happy
to see you too, George.

512
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,930
- I can't believe I'm holding these five

513
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,374
icy little digits in my hand.

514
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:18,758
(laughs)

515
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,134
I think I got a fistful of popsicles.

516
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:24,390
- (laughs) Oh God, you
haven't changed a bit.

517
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,871
- Now wouldn't that be sad.

518
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:27,206
- You know what I mean.

519
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:28,767
- Yeah.

520
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,600
I know.

521
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:35,867
(both speaking French)

522
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:01,770
So what does that mean?

523
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,610
- Love is a Bohemian
child, he knows no laws.

524
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,293
If you don't love me, I love you.

525
00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:11,783
And if I love you, watch out for yourself.

526
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,073
- Really?

527
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:15,230
- Yeah.

528
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,930
- That's some serious French shit.

529
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:23,630
(laughs)

530
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,463
- What?

531
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:26,029
- Do you ever?

532
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,860
You know, sing?

533
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,196
- What, what, that?

534
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:31,587
No, no, no, no, no.

535
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:32,837
- Why, why not?

536
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,730
- It's nothing that I
consciously don't do,

537
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,403
I just don't do it.

538
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,646
Can I see you tomorrow?

539
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:47,293
- Sing something for me, just anything.

540
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:49,205
- I don't wanna sing,

541
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:50,742
I'm not gonna sing a song right now.

542
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:51,575
- Please?

543
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:57,094
(whistles)

544
00:27:58,227 --> 00:27:59,085
Come on.

545
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,168
Just something, anything.

546
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,247
(sighs)

547
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:08,164
(sings in Italian)

548
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,277
- Oh, you lied, you lied George.

549
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:21,527
I think you do sometimes.

550
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,180
- Maybe when I'm all alone
in a beautiful theater

551
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,600
sitting next to a beautiful woman.

552
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,300
But that doesn't happen too often.

553
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,427
In fact, this would be the first night.

554
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:37,160
(laughs)

555
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,540
You know what happens when you walk away

556
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,080
from what should've been?

557
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,913
- What?

558
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,173
- Nothing.

559
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,720
Everything just keeps going.

560
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,113
- Meet me at the Blackstone
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

561
00:28:52,913 --> 00:28:55,130
(drilling)

562
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,240
- Hey look, I'm pretty busy right now.

563
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,073
- Yeah, I know, I know.

564
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:59,550
I just, you know, what
happened back there,

565
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,760
it's all in the up and up.

566
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,593
- Yes.

567
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:02,460
- I'm not gonna give you my money

568
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,573
and see this place on
60 minutes next week.

569
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:06,370
- No, no, no, we run an honest shop here.

570
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,330
- Right.

571
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,290
You told her what needed to be done,

572
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,420
how much it's gonna cost.

573
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,710
- Yeah, I told her.

574
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,440
I don't think she heard me though.

575
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,350
- What do you mean?

576
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,410
- She was doing a lot of hollering.

577
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,720
- Now what was she hollering about?

578
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,357
- She said, "Fix my fucking car.

579
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:22,840
"I need a fucking car."

580
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,673
- She said that?

581
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,480
- Actually she said, "Fix
the fucking car, Gomer."

582
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
Which goes over really big around here

583
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,710
as you can imagine.

584
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,640
- Thank you for coming.

585
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,010
They see a woman by herself

586
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,833
and they take full advantage of her.

587
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,869
Can I buy you lunch?

588
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:38,270
- No, I gotta get back.

589
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,180
- You're mad.

590
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,013
- I'm not mad.

591
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:40,846
- Why are you mad?

592
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:41,680
- I'm not mad.

593
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,730
- I'll pay you back for the car.

594
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,698
- I don't care about that.

595
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:45,531
- Then what?

596
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:46,403
- Nothing, nothing.

597
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,630
Nothing, I got a lot on my mind.

598
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,760
- Am I one of the things on your mind.

599
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,420
- Yeah, you're on my mind,

600
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,517
look, you don't wanna be on my mind.

601
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,010
- How do you know what I want?

602
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,480
I don't even know what I want.

603
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,110
- You want what everybody wants.

604
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,300
- What's that?

605
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,720
- I don't know, you
ask too many questions.

606
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,177
I'm not mad, love's not a bus,

607
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,720
and a job's not a parachute.

608
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,670
If you don't know what you
want, maybe you don't want it.

609
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,503
- Pardon me.

610
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:08,514
- I'm just saying, you know.

611
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:10,200
- You certainly are.
- You're very needy, you know,

612
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,033
I don't know if you've ever noticed that.

613
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,570
- You think I need you?

614
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,580
- Since I bumped into you--

615
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,047
- Oh, bumped into me?

616
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,340
- It's been call me, my
car, I've got a problem.

617
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,427
- Listen, if you don't
need me, I don't need you.

618
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:22,140
The only reason I ever wanted
you in the least, ever,

619
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,230
was because you wanted me and believe me,

620
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,430
that was more than half the attraction.

621
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,220
If you don't need me, you can kiss my ass.

622
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,620
- This is just so stupid,

623
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,380
why are we talking to each other this way?

624
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,130
- You must've been very lonely
the other night, George.

625
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,750
I'll pay you back for the car.

626
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,285
- You don't have to pay me back.

627
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:43,497
- Fine, then I won't.

628
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:45,080
- Okay, okay, okay!

629
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,410
- Mr. Krikkos.

630
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,243
- Yeah.

631
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,300
- I'm Stuart Aaronson with the hotel.

632
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,133
- Hey.

633
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,300
- I'm afraid you've missed her.

634
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,760
She asked me to personally pass along

635
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,040
her apologies to you, as well as this,

636
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,900
so you might connect at some point today.

637
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,733
- What's this?

638
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:18,700
- That's where she'll be.

639
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,210
I'm afraid all times are approximate.

640
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,043
- Okay.

641
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:23,230
- Also she asked me to give you this note

642
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,363
in her own hand, personally.

643
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,070
- A lot of paper.

644
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,973
- Indeed, sir.

645
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,650
Now is there anything
else we can do for you?

646
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,483
- No.

647
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,320
Thank you.

648
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,153
- Very good.

649
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,390
How are we?

650
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,223
Good.

651
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,093
- Did you take your pill?

652
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,360
- Yes, I took my pill.

653
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,680
- Well you're not doing me any favors.

654
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,883
Don't take your pill.

655
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,640
Drop dead.

656
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,120
That'll teach you.

657
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,880
- Hey, I too the pill, woman.

658
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,620
- Would you two maybe like to be

659
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,730
sitting next to one another,
I think that would be--

660
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,750
- Listen, we've been together 53 years.

661
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,280
We can be apart for an hour.

662
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,343
- 53 years.

663
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,980
What's your secret?

664
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:21,627
- Now how the hell do I know?

665
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,529
(applause)

666
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:25,946
- Here she comes.

667
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,920
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we are lucky today to be

668
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,350
graced with a most generous appearance

669
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,350
by one of our country's
most esteemed performers.

670
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,940
- Did you have trouble finding this?

671
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,282
- Two hospitals and a
homeless shelter later.

672
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,115
- Sorry.

673
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:05,948
- It's okay.

674
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:07,900
- And perhaps the greatest
diva the world has known

675
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,000
since Maria Callas.

676
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,750
(mic screeching)

677
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,630
I can't tell you how excited I am today.

678
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,463
I'm sure some of you know that,

679
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,683
you know how excited I am about opera.

680
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,570
Of course, my mother was the one

681
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,140
who introduce me to
opera in the living room.

682
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,424
All those old records.

683
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:25,920
(laughs)

684
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,510
Of course, I wasn't
allowed in the living room,

685
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,030
so I waited outside
and listened very often

686
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,900
in the anteroom.

687
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,843
- You know, you gave me a sore throat.

688
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:35,402
- Me, me?
- Yeah.

689
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:37,235
- You kept me out late last night.

690
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,325
- Sorry.

691
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:42,410
- Lucia di Lammermoor, the
gown on her wedding night,

692
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,820
the blood on the night of her wedding,

693
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
the blood stained gown.

694
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,540
A lovely moment, a gorgeous moment.

695
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,600
The trills with the

696
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,923
the flutes.

697
00:33:56,122 --> 00:33:56,955
(sighs)

698
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,290
Let me get back.

699
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,720
This is the happiest day of my life

700
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,833
since my mother died.

701
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,280
So ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

702
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,663
Miss Gina Spenza.

703
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:13,746
(applause, cheering)

704
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:16,617
- Thank you so much.

705
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:17,965
Oh, thank you.

706
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:19,426
Oh my goodness.

707
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:21,676
(applause)

708
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,701
Thank you very much.

709
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:29,950
Well I must say, I am absolutely pleased

710
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,230
to have this opportunity to come by,

711
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,640
say hello, and meet some of you.

712
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,280
Many of you may know my grandmother

713
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
was a member of the community here

714
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,311
for a number of years. I don't
know if any of you knew her.

715
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,270
(applause)

716
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,220
I visited her often, and
I guess you could say

717
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,813
I grew quite fond of it here.

718
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:47,063
(applause)

719
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,370
Now before I have some punch
and visit with some of you,

720
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,020
are there any questions I can answer?

721
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,450
Yes?

722
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,039
- Are you still seeing Senator Evans?

723
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,640
(laughs)

724
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,692
Yes.

725
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:03,959
(applause)

726
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,440
That's funny.

727
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,750
That's usually the first
question my mother asks me.

728
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,853
Any other questions?

729
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,387
- Can you sing for us?

730
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:14,637
(applause)

731
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,970
- Regrettably, I'm sorry,

732
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,147
regrettably, I'm unable to do so.

733
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:21,980
(crowd moans)

734
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,610
I'm afraid I woke up with
a bit of a scratchy throat

735
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,140
after last night's performance.

736
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,490
I'm not even sure I'll
be able to sing tonight.

737
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,473
I tell you what.

738
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,690
A very special, and very talented

739
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,450
friend of of mine is here today.

740
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,910
Perhaps with the proper coaxing,

741
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,233
he might favor us with
something wonderful.

742
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,981
With the proper coaxing.

743
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:46,731
(light applause)

744
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:05,890
- Um, um,

745
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,683
thank you.

746
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,800
I've always respected my elders.

747
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,770
And I loved Cocoon.

748
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,250
Did you see that, Jessica Tange, Tandy.

749
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,543
Don Ameche, it was a good movie.

750
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:37,592
Okay.

751
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:41,835
(singing opera in Italian)

752
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:23,077
(applause)

753
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:34,894
(cameras clicking)

754
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:39,145
(soft music)

755
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:45,200
- Did you see how much they applauded?

756
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
- Yeah, well I mean,

757
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:50,213
they were in the mood to clap.
Everything you said and did.

758
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:52,440
"I'm happy to be here."

759
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,087
Yay!

760
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:56,233
"You're all very old and
going to be dead soon."

761
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,066
Yay!

762
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,613
(laughing)

763
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,817
- George, I was very proud of you.

764
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,565
- You were?

765
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,487
- Weren't you?

766
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:10,470
- Actually, fear is what
I remember the most.

767
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,600
- Tell the truth.

768
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,063
Have you ever felt more
wonderful in your entire life?

769
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:18,895
(soft music)

770
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,370
- Tell Vickie when she
puts together the pictures

771
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,940
not to tape them together.

772
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,670
I don't have copies of these pictures yet.

773
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,053
- We don't have to do the pictures.

774
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,920
- I wanna do the
pictures, I'm just saying.

775
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,260
Have you gotten a good
response for the party?

776
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,100
- Yes, everybody's coming.

777
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,080
Friends, family, heads of state.

778
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,680
- Heads of state should come,

779
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,960
you know how many years your father

780
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,210
has worked for this party, right?

781
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,140
- Right.

782
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,170
- Did you hear from Jilly?

783
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,270
- No.

784
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,690
- Nothing?

785
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,050
- Nothing.

786
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,040
- You didn't call her.

787
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,970
- I told you it was a bad idea.

788
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,600
- I'm gonna call her myself.

789
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,593
- Fine, call her.

790
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,810
- This is your father's retirement party.

791
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,440
She was one of your father's favorites.

792
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
- You're asking for trouble.

793
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,280
- She's family.

794
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,470
What do you want?

795
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,193
Ask me, I'll pass it to you.

796
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,107
There's a human being sitting here.

797
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,650
- Thank you.

798
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,910
- They're divorced.

799
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,150
- I don't recognize that.

800
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,200
- You didn't recognize
their marriage either.

801
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,170
- I did.

802
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,760
- Only after Andy was born.

803
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,320
- Your brother never recognized it,

804
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,210
that was the trouble.

805
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,670
He left his hide somewhere else,

806
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,850
everybody knows that.

807
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,580
- Are we gonna hear this again?

808
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,493
- Am I wrong?

809
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,350
He was never the same.

810
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,080
Everything always came
too easy to your brother.

811
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,320
That's his curse.

812
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,770
First thing doesn't go his way, he dies.

813
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,410
- That's ancient history.

814
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,380
- So what?

815
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,313
He's dead.

816
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,830
You die, what good are you then?

817
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,145
What do you want?

818
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:36,395
- I don't know.

819
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:40,863
- (sighs) She's here, you know.

820
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,780
Who's where?

821
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,460
She's here in town to sing.

822
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,653
It was on the TV.

823
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,640
- So what.

824
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,263
- Exactly, so what.

825
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,940
Poor Jilly.

826
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,890
I always said that.

827
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,413
He married her because he had to.

828
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,640
That's no way to start a marriage.

829
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,000
- What does it matter now?

830
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,880
She's gonna be married to
someone else in a week.

831
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,063
- I don't recognize that either.

832
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:10,930
(sighs)

833
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,470
I'm gonna call her.

834
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,870
- Are you listening to this?

835
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,140
- Are you kidding?

836
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:20,613
(soft music)

837
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:27,319
- (grunts) What are you doing?

838
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,449
- (laughs) Nothing.

839
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,366
- You're looking at me.

840
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:33,805
- Was I?

841
00:41:35,353 --> 00:41:37,559
You just look kinda cute when
you're sleeping, that's all.

842
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,726
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

843
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,427
- I'm awake now.

844
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:43,399
- Oh well.

845
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,741
- What time is it?

846
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,040
- 7:30.

847
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,090
Shouldn't you be at work right about now?

848
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,180
- You know what?

849
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,313
Don't bullshit me.

850
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,913
Because I know where you are.

851
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,918
You're with her.

852
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:02,751
(truck honks)

853
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:03,584
You know who.

854
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:04,733
It's in all the papers.

855
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,940
No, literally.

856
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,313
It's in all the papers.

857
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,004
- Hey, you're famous.

858
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,629
(upbeat orchestral music)

859
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:32,462
(knocking)

860
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:33,295
- Yo!

861
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,480
(upbeat orchestral music)

862
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:40,817
- I hate you.

863
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:42,017
- So don't read it, honey.

864
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,640
That's why I never read the paper,

865
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,393
nothing but bad news.

866
00:42:45,393 --> 00:42:49,320
(upbeat orchestral music)

867
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,158
Hey, have you seen my socks?

868
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:53,408
(laughing)

869
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,120
- Opera great, Gina Spenza,

870
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,710
the long time love interest

871
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,150
of Senator Richard Evans of New Hampshire,

872
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,255
was seen this week in
her hometown of Chicago

873
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,113
with a new protege.

874
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:11,727
Let's just say that the
two are old friends.

875
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:13,150
- Old friends.

876
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,123
Sounds like trouble.

877
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:15,130
- Sure does.

878
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,863
(laughing)

879
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,173
(upbeat orchestral music)

880
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:20,419
- I don't like it.

881
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:21,680
- What don't you like?

882
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,890
- It's exploitative and manipulative.

883
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,460
- And inspirational and heartwarming.

884
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,850
We're giving this guy a second chance

885
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,120
at a dream that he'd long abandoned.

886
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,270
- A dream of what?

887
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,894
Of being a dancing bear in
some opera house side show?

888
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:36,610
- (laughs) That's a very
jaundiced perspective.

889
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,420
- Jaundiced?

890
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
- What do you think?

891
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,630
- I think it would be a disaster,

892
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,099
both personally and professionally.

893
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:45,610
- (sighs) We know what you think, Lil.

894
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,883
I'm asking her.

895
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,990
- I don't even know if this is gonna be

896
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,510
something he's gonna wanna do.

897
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,900
- It's ludicrous, my God,

898
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,510
he's not a professional singer.

899
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,853
He's barely an amateur.

900
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,750
- She's right.

901
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,140
He hasn't sung in years.

902
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
- He did it on a moment's notice before.

903
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,320
Couldn't you do a little spaghetti opera,

904
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,410
just a little crowd pleaser

905
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,020
to play off of that episode yesterday?

906
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,780
We'll so something
bigger later in the tour.

907
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,096
People will love it.

908
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,395
- They'll hate it.

909
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:16,460
- Oh Christ, the purists will hate it.

910
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,113
The purists hate everything.

911
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,430
One of your greatest talents has been

912
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,550
to take the music to a broader audience,

913
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,753
to make people feel
less intimidated by it.

914
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,790
They start out loving you,

915
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,440
then they grow to love the opera.

916
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,933
That's your gift.

917
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,570
Who knows, maybe it's his gift too.

918
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:46,670
(country music)

919
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,693
- Did you want sprinkles with that?

920
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:49,720
- Yes.

921
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,113
- Bunny, or celebration?

922
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:54,323
- Celebration.

923
00:44:54,323 --> 00:44:55,737
(ketchup sputters)

924
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,143
- Oh, oh, that was daddy.

925
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,497
That was your dad.

926
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:07,467
Can you eat all that?

927
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,403
- Yeah.

928
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,013
- If you make yourself
sick, I'll get in trouble.

929
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:19,572
- How come your picture
was in the newspaper?

930
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:20,657
- Did you see that?

931
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:22,690
- You were with a lady.

932
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,530
- Yeah, she's an old friend of mine.

933
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,073
- Is she your girlfriend.

934
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,606
- No, not really, no.

935
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:31,555
- You could have girlfriend though.

936
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:32,673
- I could.

937
00:45:32,673 --> 00:45:33,506
I could.

938
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:36,593
- Like mom has Ed.

939
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,940
- Right.

940
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,773
Like mom and Ed.

941
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,680
- Are you gonna be at their wedding?

942
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,290
- Nah, no, no.

943
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,123
- Why not?

944
00:45:49,264 --> 00:45:50,314
- Well it's really a,

945
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,250
you know I was married to your mom,

946
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,520
and this is really their day.

947
00:46:00,196 --> 00:46:01,900
It's on Sunday, right?

948
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,733
- Right.

949
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,783
- You get to wear a monkey suit, don't ya?

950
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:09,170
- Then I'll have two dads.

951
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,320
- Just lick it from your elbow up, son.

952
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,252
That's it, that a boy.

953
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:22,460
(soft music)

954
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,920
This guy's a pain in the ass.

955
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,983
He calls me day and night.
- I don't mind, I don't mind.

956
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,543
- Night and day, I need this.

957
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:29,466
- George, this is like an
adventure for me, I don't mind.

958
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:30,299
- Okay.

959
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:31,510
You're not afraid of rats or anything?

960
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,850
- Don't be funny.

961
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,220
- Well you're not wearing
an open toed shoe,

962
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,053
you'll be okay.

963
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:38,012
This is it.

964
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:39,190
This is where I've wasted a life.

965
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,140
- Don't say it like that.

966
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,070
- You predicted it.

967
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,070
- I did not.

968
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,840
- Yeah, come on, all the
grief that you gave me.

969
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,730
- Grief? No, no, no, no,
I did not give you grief.

970
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,210
All I said was, you just
gotta do what you've gotta do,

971
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,070
that's what I said.

972
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,091
- Do what you gotta do.

973
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:51,982
- Yeah.

974
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:52,815
- I don't remember that.

975
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:54,587
I remember specifically,

976
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:56,767
"This is the place where things come

977
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,150
"when they stop growing."

978
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,690
(soft music)

979
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,620
- You remember every rotten thing

980
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,160
I ever said, didn't you.

981
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,861
- I remember everything.

982
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:07,694
- I hate that.

983
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,940
- I know, come on, let's get to work.

984
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,070
- So what's gonna happen
tomorrow, how's it work?

985
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,170
- Well, tomorrow we pass the baton

986
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,200
to the Gumba boys, and
my father and brother,

987
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,033
those are good,

988
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:20,213
make like Garner and
McQueen in The Great Escape.

989
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,463
- It's gonna be hard for ya, huh?

990
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:25,243
- I haven't given it much
thought, that's all right.

991
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,203
Couple more.

992
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,780
Okay.

993
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,613
Hmm.

994
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:36,920
- What are you doing?

995
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,507
- Trying to see if these
will fit up his ass.

996
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:41,437
(lighthearted music)

997
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:42,790
- Oh, I love this.

998
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,890
What do you call this?

999
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,723
- The wailing wall.

1000
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:45,556
- The wailing wall?

1001
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:46,389
- Yeah, for wailing.

1002
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,605
I have a lot of anger, you
know, that's why I come up here.

1003
00:47:50,605 --> 00:47:51,438
- Whoa.

1004
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:52,271
- You have a beer,

1005
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,520
you throw a few.

1006
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,840
Nobody gets hurt.

1007
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,597
It's like a vegetarian temper tantrum.

1008
00:47:56,597 --> 00:47:58,900
- Oh, it's kinda like singing.

1009
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,890
You know sometimes when I sing

1010
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,020
it's almost as if all the demons

1011
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,890
are rushing out of me,

1012
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,570
like fire out of a dragon.

1013
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,403
- Like that.

1014
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,410
- Yeah, you'd probably
have a little less anger

1015
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,690
if you were singing some, you know?

1016
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,880
Would you ever consider that?

1017
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,820
- What, like in the men's
choir in church or something?

1018
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,653
- Yeah.

1019
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,260
Maybe professionally.

1020
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,170
- I think it's a little late for that.

1021
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,140
- You know, George, I'd
help however I could.

1022
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,044
- Yeah, like how?

1023
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:27,063
- Like giving you the opportunity.

1024
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,090
- What kind of opportunity?

1025
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,420
- Like the other day.

1026
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,300
- That was a joke.

1027
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,920
- That wasn't a joke.

1028
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,905
- That was a joke, that
was just silliness.

1029
00:48:35,905 --> 00:48:37,340
- (sighs) You know there's actually been

1030
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,170
a little talk of you joining me onstage

1031
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,080
sometime during the tour.

1032
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,350
- People are talking, people are talking?

1033
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,610
- I'm not saying you should,

1034
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,290
but you know, if you were,

1035
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,590
thought you might like to,

1036
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,150
we're kinda thinking maybe--

1037
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,710
- I don't think I want to.

1038
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,103
- Okay.

1039
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:57,614
And there you go.

1040
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,913
- What?

1041
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,690
- (sighs) Okay, what happens when you

1042
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,940
walk away from something
that should've been?

1043
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,410
- Nothing.

1044
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,560
- Does that seem right?

1045
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:16,350
- Look, when I said that, I
wasn't talking about the opera.

1046
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,423
Okay?

1047
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,570
Throw your tomato.

1048
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:24,983
You're doing great.

1049
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:28,480
You're the prettiest one
that's ever been on that.

1050
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,146
- Thanks George.
- Slow it down a little now.

1051
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:31,730
Lower it down.

1052
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,520
Lower it down.

1053
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,706
Lower it down, you're doing fantastic.

1054
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:37,641
That's it!

1055
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,474
- Woo hoo!

1056
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:40,780
- That's it, I mean, now bring it on home.

1057
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,124
Come home, bring it on home.

1058
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:43,980
- I've always wanted to
drive one of these, George.

1059
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,930
- I'm your dream weaver,

1060
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,151
I'm making all your dreams
come true, right, right?

1061
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,151
- Okay, so give me something else to do.

1062
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,167
- Marry me!

1063
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:54,007
- What?

1064
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:56,293
- Brake, brake, brake.

1065
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,610
Marry me?

1066
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:02,443
- What?

1067
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:03,363
- You could keep the truck.

1068
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:08,762
(soft music)

1069
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:19,120
- What's the matter?

1070
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,323
- My stomach.

1071
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,163
- You're probably just
worked up about tomorrow.

1072
00:50:27,977 --> 00:50:30,770
(soft music)

1073
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,880
Come here.

1074
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,603
Come on, lay down here.

1075
00:50:37,897 --> 00:50:38,730
There.

1076
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,503
I'll rub your stomach.

1077
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:49,811
- Don't start no bolognas now.

1078
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,897
- I'm not gonna start any bolognas.

1079
00:50:54,913 --> 00:50:58,047
(soft music)

1080
00:50:58,047 --> 00:51:00,613
You're gonna miss it, aren't ya?

1081
00:51:00,613 --> 00:51:01,630
- I don't know.

1082
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,469
I don't know.

1083
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:04,636
- Sure ya are.

1084
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:08,428
- You can talk about it.

1085
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,253
(soft music)

1086
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:14,903
What are you gonna miss the most?

1087
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:19,230
- Nothing I don't miss already.

1088
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,647
(soft music)

1089
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,683
- You done good, Deany.

1090
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,953
You both did.

1091
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,660
You built a beautiful business here.

1092
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,490
And I swear on my mother's grave,

1093
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,880
we'll do right by it.

1094
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,940
- That's good to know, Sal.

1095
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,831
- You know we will.

1096
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:53,040
We know if we don't
you're little brother here

1097
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,160

1098
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,360
He won't let us fuck
it up, will ya Georgie?

1099
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,090
- That's right Sal, I'll
kick your asses if you do.

1100
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,350
- See what I told ya?

1101
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,480
That's why I'm glad he's staying.

1102
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,510
He'll keep us honest.

1103
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,600
- George is a big celebrity now.

1104
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,900
- Yeah, what's that about, George?

1105
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,150
- She a screamer, George?

1106
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,090
That'd be something if she was, huh?

1107
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,030
Mm, knock you right outta that bed.

1108
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,800
- Take it easy, Joey, he'll kick your ass

1109
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,553
before we get outta the box.

1110
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,813
- George knows I'm kidding.

1111
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,050
- Hey, where's your father?

1112
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,620
- He's on his farewell tour.

1113
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,480
He'll be around later.

1114
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,127
- All right, well these are
poured, so we'll have one now,

1115
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:32,180
and one later with papa.

1116
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,837
- Yeah, you can't walk on one leg.

1117
00:52:33,837 --> 00:52:34,943
- Absolutely.

1118
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:36,923
George.

1119
00:52:41,278 --> 00:52:43,140
To the Krikkos boys.

1120
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,910
George, it's good to have you aboard.

1121
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,760
Let's kick a little ass together.

1122
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,100
And Dean.

1123
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,680
Takes a lot of balls to
do what you're doing.

1124
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,547
I always thought Joey and me

1125
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:53,210
had the biggest balls in the world,

1126
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,063
but you, you got some big ones too.

1127
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,492
- Thank you.

1128
00:52:58,492 --> 00:52:59,325
- Salud.

1129
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,600
- So where do you guys buy your pants?

1130
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:10,076
(laughing)

1131
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:14,431
- Where do you buy your pants?

1132
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:15,401
(laughs)

1133
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,721
- Son of a bitch.

1134
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:17,750
(laughing)

1135
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,215
- Get out of the way, make way, make way.

1136
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:23,298
(applause, cheering)

1137
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:29,270
- You lucky son of a bitch, you.

1138
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,613
- You're goddamn right.

1139
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:33,040
- We'll save you a seat at the card table.

1140
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,567
- Make sure it's close to the wash room,

1141
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:36,440
I'm an old man.

1142
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,970
- Okay, old man.

1143
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,380
- Hey Dean, you leaving too?

1144
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,310
- No, I'm just helping him out.

1145
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,824
I got a few more things.

1146
00:53:42,824 --> 00:53:44,397
- All right come on, get back
to loafing and gambling, guys.

1147
00:53:44,397 --> 00:53:47,160
- All right, any last words
for the boys on the line,

1148
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,250
sir?

1149
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,550
- It's been good to know you,

1150
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,340
but the past is the past.

1151
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,350
Until we meet again on a new day,

1152
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,857
you can all kiss my ass.

1153
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,700
(laughing)

1154
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,970
- Where'd you get that?

1155
00:53:58,970 --> 00:53:59,803
- I made it up.

1156
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,660
I can make things up.

1157
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,327
(festive music)

1158
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:15,367
- No, no, not yet.

1159
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,312
How are you, huh?

1160
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:22,979
(festive music)

1161
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,807
- Georgie, come on over here a minute.

1162
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:35,860
- All right.

1163
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,700
- This opera singer.

1164
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,480
This is the girl you used to go with?

1165
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,780
- Yeah, I went with her
a long time ago, yeah.

1166
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,680
- I remember when you went with her.

1167
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,885
- Do ya?

1168
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:46,233
That's great that you remember.

1169
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,780
I mean, at your ages,
you'd think the memory

1170
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,323
would be the first thing to go.

1171
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,490
- I wish the memory was the first to go.

1172
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,920
- I forgot you could sing.

1173
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,773
- I forgot too.

1174
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,390
- You should go onto Star Search,

1175
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,101
a lot of people got started on that show?

1176
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:01,140
- Like who?

1177
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,440
- Like that one kid.

1178
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,283
The comedian.

1179
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,700
What the hell was his name?

1180
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,220
- Seinfeld?

1181
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,853
- No, he's a colored kid.

1182
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,385
- Eddie Murphy.

1183
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,300
- Popeye.

1184
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,160
- Sinbad.

1185
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,100
- Sinbad.

1186
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,510
I knew it was some frickin' sailor.

1187
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:18,863
You should go on that show.

1188
00:55:20,895 --> 00:55:22,312
- I don't think that show's still on.

1189
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:23,303
- Well I think it is.

1190
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:24,820
- I think those are repeats.

1191
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,030
- I don't think so.

1192
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,319
- Hey, isn't that your
little boy over there?

1193
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,402
- Hi grandma.

1194
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:31,903
- Yeah.

1195
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,453
- Hi mom.

1196
00:55:34,453 --> 00:55:35,837
How are ya?

1197
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:37,200
- Boy, he's sure getting big.

1198
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,090
- Isn't he though?

1199
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,090
Excuse me a minute, guys.

1200
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,293
- With Ed McMahon.

1201
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,403
- I know the show.

1202
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:46,330
- Hey Mongoose, give me a hug.

1203
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:47,510
Give me a hug.

1204
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,095
You're not too big for hugs, are ya?

1205
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:49,928
- No.

1206
00:55:49,928 --> 00:55:50,761
- Atta boy.

1207
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:53,240
- Mom says I have to hug everybody.

1208
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,073
- She's right.

1209
00:55:54,073 --> 00:55:56,231
You gotta watch your wallet in
this crowd though, you know.

1210
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,153
- Uh, dad, I don't have a wallet.

1211
00:56:00,681 --> 00:56:03,230
- Grandma wants to show you
something in the kitchen.

1212
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,350
- Where you going, where you taking him?

1213
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,450
- To the kitchen.

1214
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,390
- Going to the kitchen.

1215
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,223
- Yeah.

1216
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,540
- I didn't know you were coming.

1217
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,334
- Nobody told you, huh.

1218
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:14,167
- That's okay.

1219
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,000
- Your mom called.

1220
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,833
- It's a nice surprise.

1221
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:16,964
- Oh good.

1222
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:18,650
(clears throat)

1223
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,143
- So uh, where's the Ed.

1224
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:25,120
- They are throwing a
bachelor party for him.

1225
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,860
Yeah, I don't even wanna think about it.

1226
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,520
So what was yours like?

1227
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,070
- Mine?

1228
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,310
Cards, and cigars.

1229
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,271
- Yeah.

1230
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:36,104
- Yeah.

1231
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:36,937
- Yeah.

1232
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:38,230
- Any girls there?

1233
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,317
- What did I tell you then?

1234
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,673
- I don't remember.

1235
00:56:41,673 --> 00:56:43,103
- I don't remember either.

1236
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,072
- Oh well.

1237
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:45,940
- Oh well.

1238
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,773
- Doesn't matter now.

1239
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:47,606
- No, it doesn't matter.

1240
00:56:47,606 --> 00:56:48,710
Doesn't matter.

1241
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,543
- Yeah.

1242
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:53,680
So, saw you in the papers.

1243
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,930
- Yeah.

1244
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,250
I was there.

1245
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,640
- She coming tonight, or?

1246
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,400
- No, she's working.

1247
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,233
- Performing.

1248
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:01,460
- Right, you know she--

1249
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,365
- Right.

1250
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:03,365
- Does that.

1251
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,050
- You son of a bitch.

1252
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,543
You never said anything.

1253
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,233
- Yeah, I know.

1254
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:14,806
I don't know.

1255
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,777
- You know what's so unbelievable?

1256
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:17,610
- What?

1257
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,640
- I didn't even know you could sing.

1258
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,103
- Georgio!

1259
00:57:26,494 --> 00:57:27,870
(laughs)

1260
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:30,620
(crowd chatter)

1261
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,350
- How do you not invite the new owners?

1262
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,460
- You just don't.

1263
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,787
There's no how, you just do or not.

1264
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,820
- It would be a snub.

1265
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,880
- But what about the snub to me,

1266
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,970
I mean I don't even get consulted.

1267
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,010
- Well if anybody thought you
gave a damn about anything.

1268
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,660
- Nobody tells me Jilly's coming.

1269
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,110
- That's the old lady.

1270
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,810
There's no stopping the old lady.

1271
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,850
She's still trying to save your marriage.

1272
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,780
- The old man hates these guys.

1273
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,660
- Yeah, well, they kinda
paid for the party.

1274
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,870
- Well that's kind of a stretch.

1275
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,710
- Look, it's one night.

1276
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,820
- It's one night for you, maybe,

1277
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,737
I gotta live with these
guys every day now.

1278
00:58:05,737 --> 00:58:07,550
- Now who's fault is that?

1279
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,870
- You know, I knew you
were gonna say that,

1280
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,590
I knew it, let's talk about that, okay?

1281
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,170
- Okay, let's.

1282
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,820
- Who's fault do you think it is?

1283
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:15,950
- I know who's fault it is.

1284
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,130
There's only one man
who's fault it could be.

1285
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,733
- You wanna know how I got into this mess?

1286
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:20,566
- How?

1287
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:21,399
- You begged me.

1288
00:58:21,399 --> 00:58:22,232
- I begged you?

1289
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,080
- Yeah, you begged me.

1290
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,110
Georgie, Georgie, please come back,

1291
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,480
the old man needs you, Georgie.

1292
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,620
- Oh, that's not me.

1293
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,453
- It isn't?

1294
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:29,780
- I don't call you Georgie.

1295
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,200
- You needed me and I came.

1296
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,503
- You didn't need us?

1297
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,355
- You needed me,

1298
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:37,747
and I came.

1299
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,453
- And I'm eternally grateful.

1300
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,803
What would you have done otherwise?

1301
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,697
- God only knows.

1302
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,697
- Think about that a lot, do you George?

1303
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,273
- Lately.

1304
00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:54,293
- A lot easier than
having done it, isn't it?

1305
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,193
- Carry this shit up yourself.

1306
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,423
- Well which is it?

1307
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:04,991
Are you hurt, or embarrassed?

1308
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:07,530
(soft music)

1309
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,360
Well, you know what I think is that

1310
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,910
you're a little more
embarrassed than you are hurt.

1311
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,530
That's what I, that's how I feel.

1312
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,290
I'm not doing anything, Richard.

1313
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,640
Oh, okay, I'll grant you that.

1314
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,060
I'm doing something,

1315
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,070
but you're definitely
blowing it out of proportion.

1316
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,523
Yes, you are.

1317
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:33,040
(sighs) Look Richard, (sighs)

1318
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,170
I think we both knew that
something was about to happen.

1319
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,020
Well this is it.

1320
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,893
This is what happened.

1321
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,147
(soft music)

1322
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,870
- He needs someone to be mad at.

1323
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:54,703
- Why?

1324
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:55,600
Why does he need that?

1325
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,053
- Because he's a big kid.

1326
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,060
- Do you think I'm selfish?

1327
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,450
- No, you're not, everybody's
a little bit selfish.

1328
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,380
- So I am selfish.

1329
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,450
- Deano.

1330
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,710
Everyone has got to
look out for themselves,

1331
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:14,159
now you are not responsible
for someone else's happiness.

1332
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,576
(soft music)

1333
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:18,800
- Having fun?

1334
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,810
- Yeah.

1335
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,475
And you?

1336
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:22,845
- Yeah.

1337
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:23,745
It's a nice party.

1338
01:00:29,766 --> 01:00:32,849
- I've got a little favor to ask you.

1339
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,570
After you go on ahead and marry the Ed.

1340
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,403
- Yeah.

1341
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,513
- I'm sorry.

1342
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:42,140
- That's okay.

1343
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,590
- What's Andy gonna call him?

1344
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,423
- What do you want him to call him?

1345
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:47,923
- Well what's he call him now?

1346
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:50,400
- He calls him Ed.

1347
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,370
- Well that's good.

1348
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,900
Uncle Ed, or Mr. Ed,

1349
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,893
I think would be my absolute number one.

1350
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:57,183
- I get it, George.

1351
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,213
- He's the one, right?

1352
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:10,698
- Yeah, he's the one.

1353
01:01:10,698 --> 01:01:13,040
- How do you know he's the one?

1354
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,333
- What do you mean?

1355
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,610
- Well I'm just curious,

1356
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:18,170
I mean what is it about him that

1357
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,480
makes him the one?

1358
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,423
- Are you jealous?

1359
01:01:23,565 --> 01:01:25,010
- No, I'm not jealous.

1360
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,730
I'm happy for you.

1361
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,323
I'm happy for you, really.

1362
01:01:29,573 --> 01:01:31,952
I just wanna know what it is

1363
01:01:31,952 --> 01:01:33,853
that would make him the one.

1364
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,583
- I just know.

1365
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:41,726
- Well, you thought I was the one.

1366
01:01:41,726 --> 01:01:42,559
- Yeah.

1367
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,668
- But you were wrong.

1368
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,127
- No, I wasn't.

1369
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,913
You were.

1370
01:01:53,724 --> 01:01:56,224
(opera music)

1371
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,270
(knocks)

1372
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,500
(knocks)

1373
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,333
- Yeah.

1374
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:31,887
(sighs)

1375
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:33,853
Did you uh, forget your pitch pipe?

1376
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,270
I trust you know who I am.

1377
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,880
- Yeah, I know, you're
Senator Richard Hertz.

1378
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,380
- Senator Richard Evans.

1379
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,430
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1380
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,010
Well then, well then,

1381
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,093
who's Dick Hertz?

1382
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:51,640
- (laughs) Well, you sing, you tell jokes.

1383
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,040
Do you dance as well?

1384
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,440
- Are you asking?

1385
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,920
- I oughta punch you in the mouth.

1386
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,620
- I thought you were a politician.

1387
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,913
You don't punch, you run. (laughs)

1388
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,660
- Wonderful, I see you two have met.

1389
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,380
- Yeah, he's already asked me to dance.

1390
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,010
- I think it's time for you to go now.

1391
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,680
- Why don't we just put that to a vote.

1392
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,430
- Please just go inside, Richard.

1393
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,700
- I don't care to go inside.

1394
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,730
- Well super, why don't
you come on out here

1395
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,090
and then I'll go inside.

1396
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,670
- Inside, Richard.

1397
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,503
Please.

1398
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,383
- Make it quick.

1399
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,390
- He's pretty tough for a Democrat, huh?

1400
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:36,100
- He surprised me.

1401
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,210
I tried to call you.

1402
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:38,277
- Well here I am.

1403
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,400
- I tried to call and ask you not to come.

1404
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,380
- Why didn't you call him
and ask him not to come?

1405
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,940
- George, I didn't know he was coming.

1406
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,520
- Well then so go ahead
and ask him to leave.

1407
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,800
- I can't do that right now.

1408
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,633
- Well why not?

1409
01:03:51,531 --> 01:03:53,790
- (sighs) Normally I'm the first person

1410
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,917
to tell him where to go but--

1411
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:57,890
- But, but, but, what, what?

1412
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:00,060
- George, I don't know what to say.

1413
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,657
It was really nice, it was
so nice, I can't tell you--

1414
01:04:02,657 --> 01:04:04,160
- Nice?

1415
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,287
Nice?

1416
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:06,120
It was nice?

1417
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,550
- I'm sorry, that's not
what I was trying to say.

1418
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,580
- Yeah, well look, I'm sorry too,

1419
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,960
if it was first come first served

1420
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,793
I could've been here hours ago.

1421
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:12,910
- Don't do that.

1422
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:13,924
- What about me?

1423
01:04:13,924 --> 01:04:16,387
- (scoffs) What about you?

1424
01:04:16,387 --> 01:04:17,950
You show up 15 years later

1425
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,000
and I'm supposed to know
what to do with you?

1426
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,570
George, you don't even
know what to do with you.

1427
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,772
- I asked you to marry me.

1428
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:23,605
- Keep it down.

1429
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:25,170
- (whispers) I asked you to marry me.

1430
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,713
- Well you knew I was
involved with somebody.

1431
01:04:26,713 --> 01:04:28,060
- Involved, what does that mean, involved?

1432
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,960
- Involved, George, you know
what it is to be involved.

1433
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,470
- No, no, it sounds very clinical to me.

1434
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,650
George doesn't get it, I don't know.

1435
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,250
- Going steady, is that better?

1436
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,200
- Steady?

1437
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,670
Steady, you know where steady is?

1438
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,330
Steady is like somewhere down here.

1439
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,600
I asked you to marry me,

1440
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,930
that's like way up there.

1441
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,330
- So did he.

1442
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,320
- What?

1443
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,760
What kind of a hotel is this?

1444
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,700
My God, everybody's
got a key to your room.

1445
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,980
I mean, I just don't understand
what you're thinking about.

1446
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,370
I just don't get it.

1447
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,530
I mean, listen, don't
you know I'm the guy?

1448
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,430
- George.
- You know what I mean.

1449
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,130
That look that I saw on your face

1450
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,440
the other day when you were
driving by in your car,

1451
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,650
that look, that fear.

1452
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,316
- Fear?
- You know I'm the guy.

1453
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:07,790
You can't help it, it's a scary thing.

1454
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,867
It's okay, it's okay to
be a little bit afraid,

1455
01:05:09,867 --> 01:05:10,700
that's just the way it is.

1456
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,240
- George, I can't do this anymore.

1457
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,540
- Well why not?

1458
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,090
- I don't know.

1459
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:15,990
I'm confused.

1460
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,260
- Confused, shit.

1461
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,400
You haven't been confused
a day in your life.

1462
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,950
You wouldn't allow
yourself to be confused,

1463
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,670
it might distract you from your focus.

1464
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,110
- I am not gonna stand
here and be belittled

1465
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:26,671
for having my life in order.

1466
01:05:26,671 --> 01:05:27,820
- (scoffs) In order.

1467
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,910
You don't have a life,
you've got an itinerary.

1468
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,510
- God, what do you have, George?

1469
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,490
- I wanna sing tonight.

1470
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,040
(scoffs)

1471
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:38,873
Yeah, yeah, tonight.

1472
01:05:38,873 --> 01:05:40,810
(laughs)

1473
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,020
- Oh, you're a piece of work.

1474
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,230
You wanna sing tonight.

1475
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,943
No preparations, no rehearsals.

1476
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,430
(laughs)

1477
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:48,890
- It'll be a triumph
for the undisciplined.

1478
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:51,057
- Fine, I won't stand in your way.

1479
01:05:51,057 --> 01:05:52,040
- Good, good.

1480
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,530
Great, great, good.

1481
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,560
- Meet me at the auditorium
at 6:00 then, okay?

1482
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,580
- All right, yeah, no, I'm there.

1483
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,050
- Great, you having second thoughts?

1484
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:01,186
- No.

1485
01:06:01,186 --> 01:06:03,150
- Did I call your bluff?

1486
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,983
- Yeah.

1487
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:05,391
- Great, I'll see you at 6:00.

1488
01:06:05,391 --> 01:06:06,430
- But it's okay.

1489
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,480
- I'll see you at 6:00.

1490
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,313
- Okay.

1491
01:06:09,422 --> 01:06:11,505
(knocks)

1492
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,960
- Oh, uh, senator, you
know about that pitch pipe,

1493
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,410
I believe it's under the bed.

1494
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,193
Fuck.

1495
01:06:24,145 --> 01:06:26,312
(singing)

1496
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,361
Well, you've all paid a
lot of money to be here.

1497
01:06:32,361 --> 01:06:34,970
And we're not gonna
disappoint them, are we?

1498
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,338
That's this, I'm gonna do this,

1499
01:06:36,338 --> 01:06:39,028
all right, I can do this tonight, okay.

1500
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,226
I don't know if I can do this tonight.

1501
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:44,059
(quietly singing)

1502
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,776
(singing opera music)

1503
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,540
- (sighs) Do I have to choose?

1504
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,373
- No.

1505
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:23,563
- Great.

1506
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:26,730
(singing opera music)

1507
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:31,280
Thank you.

1508
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,380
- You're welcome.

1509
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,547
(singing opera music)

1510
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,251
She'll be introducing you after this.

1511
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,763
- All right, I know, I know.

1512
01:07:40,763 --> 01:07:41,776
- Okay.

1513
01:07:41,776 --> 01:07:44,943
(singing opera music)

1514
01:07:45,804 --> 01:07:48,255
- You're not big on this, are ya?

1515
01:07:48,255 --> 01:07:49,619
- On your performing?

1516
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:51,393
No, I'm not big on it.

1517
01:07:51,393 --> 01:07:52,274
Love the opera.

1518
01:07:52,274 --> 01:07:53,648
Hate the circus.

1519
01:07:53,648 --> 01:07:56,933
I wish you well though.

1520
01:07:56,933 --> 01:07:59,183
(applause)

1521
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,017
- Thank you very much.

1522
01:08:13,017 --> 01:08:14,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

1523
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,090
I have a special treat for you tonight.

1524
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:19,070
A dear friend of mine who
hails from Chicago is here,

1525
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:21,750
and he'd like to sing a
special selection for you.

1526
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,920
Now if you'd all join me in
welcoming him to the stage,

1527
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,533
Mr. George Krikkos.

1528
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:26,614
(applause)

1529
01:08:26,614 --> 01:08:27,787
- Break a leg.

1530
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:30,037
(applause)

1531
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,834
(piano playing)

1532
01:08:54,003 --> 01:08:57,170
(singing opera music)

1533
01:09:06,164 --> 01:09:08,497
(faltering)

1534
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:18,748
- George.

1535
01:09:18,748 --> 01:09:19,581
- Matt.

1536
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:26,000
- Excuse me, I think I
broke a vein in my head,

1537
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,833
I gotta wait.

1538
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,071
Okay.

1539
01:09:29,071 --> 01:09:31,321
(laughter)

1540
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:38,453
This is Matt, the accompaniment.

1541
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,400
We just met.

1542
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,870
Which I'm sure was the problem.

1543
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,580
So I'm gonna try it again.

1544
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,850
Sorry about that.

1545
01:09:46,884 --> 01:09:47,984
It should be okay now.

1546
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,583
Go from wherever.

1547
01:09:57,788 --> 01:10:01,705
(plays piano, repeating music)

1548
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,423
I wanna apologize.

1549
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:32,983
I know you all came to hear a show.

1550
01:10:35,809 --> 01:10:37,613
I don't wanna keep you from that

1551
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:43,883
in any way.

1552
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,963
So, I apologize.

1553
01:10:49,623 --> 01:10:50,456
I'm sorry.

1554
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:53,647
Thank you.

1555
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:56,397
(light applause)

1556
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,583
You're angry.

1557
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,150
- Aren't you the one who wanted to sing?

1558
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:57,983
- Yeah.

1559
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,610
- So why did you stop?

1560
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:05,040
- What would you have done?

1561
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:07,650
- Finished what I started.

1562
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,333
- I tried.

1563
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,493
- What did you think would happen?

1564
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,333
- Well I don't know.

1565
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,100
If you knew, why'd you let me do it?

1566
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:20,100
- What did you want me to
do, save you from yourself?

1567
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,919
- That would've been nice.

1568
01:12:23,919 --> 01:12:25,990
- That's all you ever want, isn't it?

1569
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:29,465
Everybody should always
act in your best interest.

1570
01:12:29,465 --> 01:12:30,940
(sighs)

1571
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,290
You know what's really funny?

1572
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,783
They were 100% behind you.

1573
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:36,750
- Who?

1574
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,080
- The audience.

1575
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,788
- I don't care about
them, I did it for you.

1576
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:45,520
- (scoffs) Oh, that was for me.

1577
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,203
George, I forgot to thank you.

1578
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,410
- Look, I'm gonna go.

1579
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,460
- Fine, go.

1580
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,293
- Fine.

1581
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,504
(laughs)

1582
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,477
(door slams)

1583
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,107
For 15 fuckin' years

1584
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:23,130
I've been playing can you top this

1585
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,773
with the memory of you.

1586
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:28,983
You know what?

1587
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,443
I can't.

1588
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:33,721
I just can't.

1589
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,460
You don't have the decency to go away.

1590
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,113
You're everywhere.

1591
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,083
Everywhere.

1592
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,670
You're on TV, you're on magazines,

1593
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:46,320
you're on posters, you're
on a hundred posters

1594
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,810
that cry out to me loud when
I'm walking on the street

1595
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,260
just minding my own business.

1596
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,963
Why don't I haunt you?

1597
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,860
Now,

1598
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:07,333
it's been nice, right?

1599
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:10,183
Very nice.

1600
01:14:11,462 --> 01:14:13,443
I mean, you got what
you wanted, didn't you?

1601
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,200
Got the senator to step up to the altar

1602
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,180
just a little bit quicker.

1603
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,180
(slaps)

1604
01:14:22,777 --> 01:14:27,777

01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,590
- No, I'm talking, I said destiny,

1623
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,130
why do you do that all the time?

1624
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,690
I said destiny.

1625
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:32,563
- I suppose.

1626
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:35,983
- Me too.

1627
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,040
So why are we nowhere?

1628
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:40,983
- I'm not nowhere.

1629
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,320
- You're here, aren't you?

1630
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,833
This is nowhere, pal.

1631
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,053
Welcome to nowhere.

1632
01:15:52,578 --> 01:15:54,328
- Hey, how you doing?

1633
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,797
- Okay.

1634
01:15:56,797 --> 01:15:58,247
- Can I talk to you a minute?

1635
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,783
- You need permission?

1636
01:16:01,713 --> 01:16:02,913
- No, I mean in private.

1637
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,123
- Bye.

1638
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,391
- Where you going?

1639
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:09,994
- I'm going somewhere.

1640
01:16:09,994 --> 01:16:11,490
(sighs)

1641
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:12,647
- A man with a plan.

1642
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,840
- I owe you an apology.

1643
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,673
- For what?

1644
01:16:23,148 --> 01:16:24,198
- I'd rather not say.

1645
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:28,440
- Why not?

1646
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,290
- I have reasons.

1647
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,010
- Well if I don't know what you did,

1648
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,510
how do I know if I should forgive you?

1649
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,350
- Don't forgive me, okay?

1650
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:39,913
You should never forgive
me for what I did.

1651
01:16:39,913 --> 01:16:42,350
- Then why are you apologizing?

1652
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:44,093
- Because I'm sorry, all right?

1653
01:16:45,615 --> 01:16:46,880
- I mean I feel like we're reenacting

1654
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,751
the breakup of Abbot and Costello.

1655
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:52,158
You wanna just tell me
what's on your mind?

1656
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:53,970
- I, I think it'd be better

1657
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,720
for everybody involved if I didn't.

1658
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,431
- Well then why did you bring it up?

1659
01:16:59,431 --> 01:17:01,931
(light music)

1660
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,573
- Because it's a small world,

1661
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,693
and people talk.

1662
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,033
And if you're like me,

1663
01:17:09,033 --> 01:17:11,010
you shoot first and ask questions later.

1664
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:14,743
So, I'm just warning you in advance.

1665
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,180
- All right.

1666
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,497
I don't care, well, you're forgiven.

1667
01:17:19,497 --> 01:17:20,400
Okay?

1668
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,233
- Yeah?

1669
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,377
- Yeah, I'm cleaning the slate tonight.

1670
01:17:24,377 --> 01:17:26,703
That's old business.

1671
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,800
- Well come on, do me a favor,

1672
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,460
punch me in the fuckin' head or something.

1673
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,943
- No, I'm not gonna hit you in the head.

1674
01:17:34,827 --> 01:17:37,070
- All right, let me buy you a drink.

1675
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:37,910
- Ah no.

1676
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,743
- Come on, let me buy you a drink.

1677
01:17:38,743 --> 01:17:40,753
- No, no, no drinks, I'm good.

1678
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,210
(light music)

1679
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,487
- You know what you got, George?

1680
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,323
You got class.

1681
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,730
Jesus, you'd never know by looking at you.

1682
01:18:01,064 --> 01:18:03,564
(light music)

1683
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:11,400
- You all right?

1684
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,600
- Yeah.

1685
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,433
Yeah.

1686
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:17,260
- Couldn't keep his mouth shut, could he?

1687
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,093
- Nope.

1688
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:22,693
About what?

1689
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:27,350
- [Announcer] Get a
Culligan water softener

1690
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:30,540
and end hard water for
good. (phone ringing)

1691
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,100
- I hope you rot in hell, you bastard.

1692
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,390
- How'd you know it was me?

1693
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:35,223
- George?

1694
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,420
George.

1695
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,040
- Why are you crying, what's wrong?

1696
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,930
- I had a very bad night.

1697
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,215
- Well what'd you do, where'd you go?

1698
01:18:44,215 --> 01:18:46,490
- He pushed me, George.

1699
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:47,810
- Who pushed you?

1700
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,208
Did Al push you?

1701
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,870
- No.

1702
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,560
Who told you about Al.

1703
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,735
- Nevermind that, who pushed you?

1704
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:57,195
(rings bell)

1705
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:58,195
- Who is it?

1706
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:04,940
- You Jimmy?

1707
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,013
- Yeah.

1708
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:08,180
(punches)

1709
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,823
- George, oh shit.

1710
01:19:16,177 --> 01:19:17,270
Are you okay?

1711
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,103
- Yeah.

1712
01:19:18,103 --> 01:19:19,140
- Okay.

1713
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:19,973
- You want breakfast?

1714
01:19:19,973 --> 01:19:21,000
- Yeah.

1715
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,833
Let's go, hurry.

1716
01:19:35,028 --> 01:19:36,400
You're still mad.

1717
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,233
- About what?

1718
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,200
- About Jimmy.

1719
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,810
- Jimmy who?

1720
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,160
- The guy you just punched.

1721
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,500
- I'm not mad about Jimmy.

1722
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,977
- Are you mad about Al?

1723
01:19:48,977 --> 01:19:50,173
- I'm not mad about Al.

1724
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:52,923
Why Al?

1725
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,753
- Why anybody?

1726
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:58,080
- You could do better.

1727
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:58,913
- Says who?

1728
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,928
I hate this quiet,

1729
01:20:08,928 --> 01:20:12,380
you're not even eating anything either.

1730
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,213
- I'm not hungry.

1731
01:20:13,213 --> 01:20:15,640
- Then why did we order all this food?

1732
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,950
- I thought you were hungry.

1733
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,990
- Well I'm not hungry
enough for the both of us.

1734
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:19,823
- More coffee?

1735
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:22,263
- No, that's all right,

1736
01:20:22,263 --> 01:20:23,783
just the check when you get a chance.

1737
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,460
- Shall I wrap some of this up for you?

1738
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,530
- Yeah.
- No, thank you.

1739
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:30,433
- It's no trouble.

1740
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,513
- No thank you, just the check.

1741
01:20:37,515 --> 01:20:39,500
- Why didn't you let her wrap it up?

1742
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,023
- It's breakfast, you
can't reheat breakfast.

1743
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,763
Did I ever tell you I was
engaged to be married once?

1744
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,590
- Yeah, I think you did.

1745
01:20:55,615 --> 01:20:59,146
- When?

1746
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,085
- I don't remember.

1747
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,967
- I don't think I ever told you.

1748
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:03,630
- Well I thought that you did.

1749
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:04,910
- I think you're thinking of another girl.

1750
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,660
- I'm not thinking of another girl.

1751
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:19,230
- He was very nice young man.

1752
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,553
Treated me like a queen.

1753
01:21:24,253 --> 01:21:26,020
My mom said he was too good to me

1754
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,083
and he never stood a chance.

1755
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:31,823
But when you're young, you
like a challenge, right?

1756
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:41,401
I don't think I'll be
seeing you for a while.

1757
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,573
- Yeah, I kinda got the same feeling.

1758
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:49,303
- Will you do me a favor?

1759
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:51,913
- Anything.

1760
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,083
- Miss me.

1761
01:21:57,935 --> 01:22:00,352
(soft music)

1762
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,600
(opera music)

1763
01:23:04,223 --> 01:23:05,960
(phone rings)

1764
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,390
- Thank you for calling
the Blackstone Hotel,

1765
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,420
this is Stuart, how may I help you?

1766
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,360
- Stuart, thank God it's you.

1767
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,560
If anybody can help me, it's you Stuart.

1768
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,420
Listen, Miss Spenza, do
you know where they went?

1769
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,370
- Yes, Mr. Krikkos.

1770
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,810
I'm afraid you've just missed her,

1771
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,050
they checked out moments ago.

1772
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:22,330
- Do you know where they are now?

1773
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,402
- I believe they're departing
out of Union Station.

1774
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:27,662
- Great, great, thanks pal.

1775
01:23:27,662 --> 01:23:31,162
(upbeat orchestral music)

1776
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:40,372
(upbeat opera music)

1777
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,544
- What's your name?

1778
01:24:23,544 --> 01:24:24,377
Leila.

1779
01:24:25,419 --> 01:24:28,752
Did you like the performance last night?

1780
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:36,934
Here you go.

1781
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:44,381
(singing opera music)

1782
01:24:56,107 --> 01:24:57,107
- Oh my God.

1783
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:02,125
(singing opera music)

1784
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:37,352
- It's time to go.

1785
01:25:37,352 --> 01:25:40,519
(singing opera music)

1786
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:02,415
The guy is a fucking lunatic.

1787
01:26:02,415 --> 01:26:05,582
(singing opera music)

1788
01:26:19,665 --> 01:26:21,915
(applause)

1789
01:26:36,669 --> 01:26:39,836
(alarm clock buzzing)

1790
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:55,162
- Look at this.

1791
01:26:55,162 --> 01:26:57,637
They sent us a fruit basket.

1792
01:26:57,637 --> 01:26:58,761
What the hell kind of a moron

1793
01:26:58,761 --> 01:27:02,120
would send a fruit basket
to a produce company?

1794
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,173
- Maybe it's a joke.

1795
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:05,310
- What kinda joke?

1796
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,173
- We're a produce company.

1797
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,283
That's a fruit basket.

1798
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:12,323
You get it?

1799
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:14,913
- No.

1800
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,930
- How's it going so far?

1801
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,403
