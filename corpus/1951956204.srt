<i>[Isocrate]</i> Hi to you all</font>

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,432
What's all this?

3
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,741
I'm just trying to make sense
of what's happening to me.

4
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,998
The way i figure,
i'm in a coma somewhere

5
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,152
Or on a very intense
drug trip.

6
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,931
Maybe i've traveled
through time,

7
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:39,031
Or perhaps i've, uh,
crash-landed on an alien planet,

8
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:41,065
And as we speak,

9
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,625
Extraterrestrials are trying
to harvest my intellect-

10
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:45,900
I mean, such as it is.

11
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,271
Maybe i'm the victim
of a mind experiment,

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,132
Or maybe i've died
and gone to heaven... or hell.

13
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,820
How about purgatory?
or maybe...

14
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,690
I've plain gone insane

15
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,522
'Cause i don't know
what's real anymore.

16
00:00:58,608 --> 00:00:59,806
What's this supposed
to mean?

17
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:01,867
That represents
the unknown.

18
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,353
All things
i haven't thought of yet.

19
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:08,751
It's the one out of all these
that scares me the most.

20
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:15,302
Hey.
-This is for your own good.

21
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:16,609
If the lieutenant sees this,

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,630
You'll wish you could
go back in time.

23
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,135
I can't see her face-

24
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:28,853
Maya,
My girlfriend in 2008.

25
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,645
I spent all last night
trying to picture her smile.

26
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:35,557
I couldn't do it
no matter how hard i tried.

27
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,930
So maybe if i can
figure all this out...

28
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:44,024
Sam, no more
of this crazy talk.

29
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,097
I'm trying to be
a friend to you, but-

30
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:47,240
Okay, fair enough.

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,743
What i'm doing in 1973
and how to get back-

32
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,092
I'll figure it out
on my own.

33
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,725
But until then, i guess i'm left with
only one option. and what's that, Sam?

34
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,732
To spend my time here
doing what it is i do best.

35
00:01:58,953 --> 00:01:59,320
Which is?

36
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:02,540
Catching bad guys.

43

What's the big hurry, Trent?

44
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:43,372
We just want to talk to you
about an armed robbery.

45
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:43,741
You run like that,

46
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,270
We'll begin to think you're
guilty of something, huh?

47
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:51,633
Oops.

48
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,292
Please, help me! help!

49
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,184
What did you do that for?
for making me run.

50
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,617
It's all right. he's dressed
for a dip. i can't swim!

51
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:02,368
Isn't this a predicament? nah,
not really. Scum bums float.

52
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,612
Please! help!

53
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,864
All right. oh, come on. you can't
be serious. who are you working

54
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,812
The check cashing robberies
with, trent?

55
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:14,427
I don't know anything! you could
tell it to us, or you could tell it

56
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,348
To the little fishies
at the bottom of the lake.

57
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,299
Bye-bye.

58
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,940
Uh, i don't think
he's gonna come up, guys.

59
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:27,055
Can't let him drown.

60
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,165
All right.
get him out, Chris.

61
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,038
Oh, I can't swim.

62
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,273
Ray?

63
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:34,332
Nah, i took some lessons
when i was a kid.

64
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,360
They didn't stick.

65
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,355
Unbelievable. Chris?

66
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,086
Hooray!

67
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:53,893
Come on.

68
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:02,138
All right, just breath.
you'll be fine.

69
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:02,914
Just breath!

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,088
What's the hurry,
Mark Spitz?

72
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:07,995
Uhh!

73
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,414
Hey, get this guy
out of here.

77
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,204
I miss you, Maya.

78
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:25,445
You okay, Sam?

79
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:28,342
He looks like one of them
cartoon characters,

80
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:29,991
Got hit over the head
with a frying pan.

81
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,979
Don't he, loot? yeah, he
does! like in the funny papers.

82
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,355
Like in the funny papers.

83
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:39,801
Yeah,
like in the funny papers.

84
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,579
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

And wake up in 1973.</i>

86
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,604

I'm here,</i>

87
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,607
<i>But whatever has happened,</i>

88
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,612
<i>It's like I've landed

89
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:58,358
<i>Now if I can work out
the reason, I can get home.</i>

90
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:09,880
Last week, three triple "A" money
check cashing stores

91
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,688
Were robbed.

92
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,424
A little over $12,000
taken.

93
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,281
Oh, a tasty haul.

94
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:18,084
And best of luck to 'em,
whoever they are.

95
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,477
Three bodies were found,
one at each store-

96
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:22,565
Penny Driscoll.

97
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,051
Hey, looks like
she was cute...

98
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,053
Before she put on
the dead chick mask.

99
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,355
Alonzo de Souza
and Dennis Maguire.

100
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:32,831
All shot,
and that's no small thing

101
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,930
Considering they were tucked
snug behind bulletproof glass

102
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:38,122
With no witnesses,
no sign of forced entry.

103
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:39,691
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's very cool.

104
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,510
Hey, listen, any chance I'm
gonna get sprung anytime soon?

105
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,293
You know, "laugh-in"
is on tonight, and...

106
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:47,455
I got it bad
for that goldie hawn.

107
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:48,824
We know you're involved,
Trent.

108
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,597
No one loves hitting
check cashing stores

109
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:53,299
Like you
and your monkey squad.

110
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:56,584
So who were you meetin' at the
pool? i was meetin' my aunt Doris.

111
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,435
You know, you're just her type.
no, seriously.

112
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,270
I should give her your number.
you could be my uncle Gene.

113
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,435
Uncle Gene

114
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:05,725
Hey, that'd be perfect.

115
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,378
Why don't we practice?

116
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,603
Say it, you filthy scrote.
Aah!

117
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,208
You want me to stop?
Say it.

118
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,525
Aah! uncle! uncle!

119
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,345
uncle! uncle.

120
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:22,662
Not bad.

121
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,921
What is someone who can't swim
doing at lasker pool, Trent?

122
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,597
Well, it's never too late
to start.

123
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,428
Learning the backstroke
ain't a crime, is it?

124
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:33,836
We found this on you
when we pulled you in.

125
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,136
Could this be your cut
of the tiple "A" money jobs?

126
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,937
Or you just need a little
padding in your swim trunks?

127
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,128
Yeah, that ain't
my scrat.

128
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,741
If it was,
wouldn't it be wet?

129
00:06:58,462 --> 00:06:59,247
You were saying?

130
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,108
What is it, June?

131
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:09,981
Assistant district attorney
crocker is here.

132
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:13,020
Fine. throw this pile of pus
back in the cage.

133
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,751
Oh, no, come on, man.
that cell smells like vomit.

134
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,014
Oh, i can help you
with that.

135
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,307
What was that?

136
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,596
That money isn't from
the check cashing robberies.

137
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,838
<i>Yeah, and Roe vs. Wade
ain't really two options</i>

138
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,345
When you find yourself
in a river.

139
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,261
What does that even mean?
That's an analogy.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,202
Uh, no,
I don't think it is.

141
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,054
<i>It's like an analogy.</i>

142
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,554
Where i come from,
what you did is called

143
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,002
"Tampering
with physical evidence,"

144
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:44,108
And it's a class "E" felony. where
you come from? where is that, Hyde?

145
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:46,845
Where guns
are made of gingerbread,

146
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,407
And criminals confess
for lollipops.

147
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:51,712
Do you have any evidence
linking Trent to the robberies?

148
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,473
Well, well, well.
Aren't you the eager beaver?

149
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,264
<i>Now that was an analogy.</i>

150
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,375
No, that was just
obnoxious.

151
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,783
Ah, what's a guy gotta do to get
an analogy?

152
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,603
If we have the evidence,

153
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:10,004
We'd be able to charge him by now, right?
that's a lot of questions for a secretary.

154
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,242
There he is-

155
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:14,170
The golden retriever of
the district attorney's office.

156
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,471
Thank you, No-Nuts.

157
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:20,407
Lee, this is the transfer
from Hyde i told you about-

158
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,197
Sam Tyler.

159
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,890
Sam, this is Lee Crocker.

160
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,598
Not only does he know
where all the bodies are buried,

161
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,973
He knows the shovel sizes.

162
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,084
Welcome aboard, Tyler.

163
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:33,961
Like two peas in a pansy pod.

164
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:36,763
Detective,
If ignorance was a drug,

165
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,242
You'd be high all the time.

166
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,753
<i>Now that was an analogy.</i>

167
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,200
I took a look
at the file, Gene.

168
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,498
The F.C.C.
has a better case

169
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,098
Against George Carlin
and his seven dirty words

170
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,024
Than you have
against Kim Trent.

171
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,325
I agree.

172
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:57,129
We have no evidence
to secure a conviction.

173
00:08:58,182 --> 00:08:59,859
Give us a second, Lee.

174
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:03,355
Detective Tyler and I
need a moment. Of course.

175
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:11,101
You want evidence?

176
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:17,157
Aladdin's cave.

177
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,597
What the hell is that?

178
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:21,960
There's 300 microdots
of L.S.D. here.

179
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,223
We plant 'em on Kim Trent

180
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,030
And watch him grow into
a big flower of justice.

181
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,429
That's just...

182
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,737
Great.

183
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,319
I detect sarcasm. How would you
do it where you come from?

184
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,626
We wouldn't have pulled him in
without evidence.

185
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:41,438
eEven if you knew there were people out there
in real danger? people are always in danger .

186
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,787
One minute, you're going about
your business. the next...

187
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:45,692
bang! you're taken out
by a speeding car.

188
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:48,252
Well, I'm taking a speeding car
off the road.

189
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:50,426
So what do you wanna do?

190
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,716
We give him
a desk appearance ticket,

191
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,223
We cut him loose,
but we stay on him.

192
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:59,076
We follow him,
see where he takes us,

193
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,851
Get some real evidence
so we can put him away for good.

194
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,038
That's your big plan?

195
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:04,891
Yeah, that's my big plan.

196
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:06,524
Fine.

197
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:08,027
Cut him loose.

198
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,303
But whatever happens next
is on your head.

199
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,538
You and Ray stay on Trent.

200
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:22,323
Anywhere he goes, you guys go. Got it? 
-sure thing.

201
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:23,474
We'll relieve you
in the morning.

202
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:27,901
Okay. i don't know if Ray's
gonna go for that plan. why not?

203
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,901
He doesn't really, uh-
He doesn't like me.

204
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:31,020
No.
No, i know.

205
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:33,686
No, the loot put him in
for a promotion to second grade,

206
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,211
And then you show up.

207
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,832
He-he just feels
like you took his spot.

208
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,619
But i wouldn't take it personal. just
- Yeah, well,

209
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,536
I didn't request this transfer.
It just happened.

210
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,391
It's like Guantanamo bay
in here.

211
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,567
Oh, I wouldn't know.
i've never been to Puerto Rico.

212
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:51,110
Kim Trent, here is a D.A.T.
You are free to go.

213
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:54,199
You gotta respect those
who defend the constitution.

214
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,334
All hail
the Nixon administration.

215
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,381
Yeah, don't get too attached.

216
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:15,949
Are you okay, sir?
-Did you just see that?

217
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,352
Was it a rat? the rats
are big in this house, sir,

218
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,238
But they're harmless mostly.

219
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,332
I cleaned out that cell.

220
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,291
It smelled of vomit.

221
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:29,135
<i>He was right.
It did stink to high heaven.</i>

222
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:31,180
Well, I'm sure the, uh,

223
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,550
The next prisoner
will appreciate your efforts.

224
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,582
Tt's all love and light here
at the, uh, 1-2-5.

225
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:48,488
<i>Other news,
in honor of mother's day,</i>

226
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,275
<i>Elvis Presley will be
performing a special concert</i>

227
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,275
<i>In Lake Tahoe
at the Tahoe Sahara</i>

228
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,295
<i>In memory of his mother,
Gladys Presley-</i>

233
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:32,142
Whoa.

234
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,437
You must be 2B.
I'm Windy.

235
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:37,242
Windy.
Now that's an unusual name.

236
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,267
My fathenamed me Windy

237
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:41,437
Because he was a sailor and
wind was his gold. I'm Sam.

238
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:43,506
What?

239
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,193
Hey, wow! your fate line-
It's bisected!

240
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:50,523
Is that a good thing? It can
be. It's like a record skipping.

241
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,379
You're listening to one song,
the needle gets bumped,

242
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,445
And you're grooving
to a whole new tune.

243
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,167
What's up there? well, um,
there-for starters, no naked women.

244
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,887
Are you new to New York?
You could say that.

245
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,190
It's an adjustment.

246
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:05,591
I get homesick all the time
for Decorah, Iowa.

247
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,781
Lot of people,
a lot of love back there.

248
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:10,058
I know the feeling.
I used to spend hours

249
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:12,274
Just floating in an inner tube,  
looking up at the clouds.

250
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,374
You and me,
we stay in one place,

251
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,208
But the clouds go everywhere.
So sometimes I'd ask them

252
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,095
To carry a message
back to Decorah for me.

253
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,623
I imagine there's someone
floating in a lake,

254
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:25,151
Looking up at the same cloud,
sending me their love, too.

255
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:29,992
Hey, do you like to dance?
because i love to dance!

256
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:30,846
Not really.

257
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,011
Oh, great.
Well, then we'll have to dance.

258
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:33,897
Okay.

259
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,427
I'll see you around, 2B.

260
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,774
2-4-6 to central K,

261
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,827
We are approaching
Trent's apartment.

262
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,145
Where are Chris and Ray?

263
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,229
2-4-6 to central K.

264
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,825
Proceed, 2-4-6.

265
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,981
We're outside
Kim Trent's apartment.

266
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,914
Detectives Carling and Skelton
are not here.

267
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,673
Please raise car 1-3-5

268
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,787
And advise with their
location, K. 10-4, 2-4-6.

269
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:10,761
So is this how
you do things in Hyde?

270
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,234
You sit on your ass

271
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,908
And watch known criminals
pick their noses.

272
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,734
Actually, in Hyde,
we sit on our noses

273
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,818
And watch known criminals pick their
asses. All units, we have a report

274
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,500
Of a 10-22 disturbance
at triple "A" check cashing.

275
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,265
Let's go.

276
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,769
Still think it's Trent?
Actually...

278
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:36,855
Hey, police!

279
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:38,977
Take cover!

280
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,660
Enough.

281
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:52,487
I hit him.
good.

282
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,766
You okay?
uh, yeah, I think so.

283
00:14:58,235 --> 00:14:58,885
June?

284
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:15,004
She's gonna be okay.

285
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:16,910
Pulse is normal.

286
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,917
All right. The bleeding's
stopped. Excuse me.

287
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,461
All right, let's get her.
Ready?

288
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:23,906
Okay.

289
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:28,371
She's gonna be okay.

290
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:31,513
Got the door? yeah, come
on. let's go. Lock it down.

291
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,993
All right.
All right, go ahead.

292
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,952
Where were you guys?

293
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:43,134
Loot, we got a radio message
to call into command.

294
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,324
Now I figured it was you

295
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:48,136
Shutting down Tyler's
brilliant surveillance scheme.

296
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:51,592
Took us three blocks south
to find a pay phone.

297
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,707
Found this radio
in June's car.

298
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,399
She must've
heard the call go out

299
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,522
And tried to be batgirl
or something.

300
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:01,594
And Junie always had dreams
of doing something important

301
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:02,628
At the department.

302
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,896
I told her, "you're a twirl, know your place." 
-So she didn't.

303
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:10,439
All right, I'm gonna canvass
the block, get some statements.

304
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,393
Somebody must've
had eyeballs on this.

305
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,365
This doesn't make any sense.

306
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,753
Trent took a huge risk.
He knew we'd be on to him.

307
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,899
There has to be a reason.

308
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:30,633
I want this mess cleaned up.

309
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,518
And I want you
to clear this away.

310
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,186
I don't want any of her
left lying on the street.

311
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,901
This is an active crime scene,
it still needs to be processed.

312
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:51,111
Clean it up!
I want you to clean it up now!

313
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,591
She works at the precinct.
She is family.

314
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,529
And I want to be able
to look her dad in the eye

315
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,627
And say you cleaned up

316
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,228
Every drop
of her precious blood.

317
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,980
Get off me! you can't
blame me, you lunatic!

318
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:08,788
This is Trent's fault!
He pulled the trigger!

319
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:13,054
You made sure there was a trigger
to pull! we had no evidence!

320
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:14,344
Tell that to June!

321
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,938
I give up. I give up!

322
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,690
I'm sick of this cosmic joke

323
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,512
That everyone
seems to be in on but me!

324
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:24,663
I'm sick of it.

325
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:10,308
Real.

326
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:14,697
Unreal.

327
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:18,334
Real.

328
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:22,235
Unreal.

329
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,044
Re-ow!

330
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:56,567
You know, this neighborhood
has gone to the dogs.

331
00:18:56,601 --> 00:19:01,144
Mm-hmm, right.
That's, uh, an unusual ashtray.

332
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:04,283
Yeah. My granddaughter sofia
made it for me.

333
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:07,884
She loves to come over
and see all the butts in there.

334
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:10,338
<i>She says, "Nonna uses it."</i>

335
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:11,908
Beautiful story.

336
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,769
Should write a letter
to the surgeon general.

337
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,844
You know, if I squint,

338
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:20,513
There's a little bit
of that... Steve Mcqueen?

339
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,706
Um... look, you have
an unobstructed view

340
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,606
Of triple "A" money from here,

341
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,456
And judging from how much
you love your grandchild

342
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:33,132
And... your cigarettes,

343
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,982
I'm guessing you spend a lot
of time looking out that window.

344
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:40,424
Sure, I saw what happened,
but aside from the shooting,

345
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:43,455
There was nothing different
From any Tuesday or Thursday.

346
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:47,245
You guys showed up,
escorting the man who got shot.

347
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,082
"Us guys"?

348
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,795
Yeah, the police.

349
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,310
Policemen? in uniform?

350
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,226
Policemen in uniform.

351
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,064
you screwed up, you guys.

352
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,198
<i>Real big-time, huh, Stevie?</i>

353
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,271
I guess we did.

354
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:11,348
"Astronauts in orbit
to repair ailing skylab."

355
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:13,100
Hmm.

356
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:15,770
And those hippies think they
know how to get high, Junie.

357
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,067
Let's see what kind of trouble
dagwood's gettin' into today.

358
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:21,824
Been looking for you, boss.
How's she doing?

359
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:34,077
Same.

360
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,973
Uhh! oh!

361
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,487
Ah.
That felt good.

362
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,434
Yeah?

363
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,523
Then you're gonna
love this.

369
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:58,322
AAH!

372
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:12,454
I always liked June.

373
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:17,833
Truth be told, she'd probably
make a good cop.

374
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:24,057
I only know one way
to police.

375
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,522
So do I.

376
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:32,941
I'm not squeaky-clean,
and neither is this city.

377
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,446
I love this city.

378
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:39,494
It needs whoever it can get
to look after it. That's me.

379
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:42,611
You're gonna
ma this right.

380
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:46,303
Well...

381
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:49,600
I found a witness

382
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:53,136
Who saw two uniforms
escort Trent into the store.

383
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,386
That's how
they gained access.

384
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:57,401
Watch what you're saying, Tyler. 
-How can you...

385
00:21:57,437 --> 00:21:59,436
The keeper
of Aladdin's cave...

386
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:00,986
Question the existence of dirty cops

387
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,103
Just because, you know,
you don't like it?

388
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,236
I'm not turing the spotlight
on my own department.

389
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,754
No, you're just gonna
coerce testimony

390
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:11,769
And set up suspects
just to close the case.

391
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,069
Oh, you got somethin'
on your mouth there.

392
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,856
Let me-let me see.

393
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:17,190
Ah! what are you doin'?
hey, stop that! get off me!

394
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,256
<i>Don't do-don't do that.
I'll do that.</i>

395
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:21,963
Hey!

399
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,287
Spaceman!

400
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:36,259
Heard the boss gave you
a ride to pummel city.

401
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,834
I need to talk with you,
Ray,

402
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,892
About your moonlighting.

403
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:45,143
Talk to me.

404
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:48,084
Ain't like I'm the only one
moonlighting at the 1-2-5.

405
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:49,760
Your named turned up

406
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:52,432
On a list of cops
who work security for triple "A" money.

407
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:55,261
Yeah.

408
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:58,493
I make $300 and change a week
as a third grade detective.

409
00:22:58,494 --> 00:22:59,993
That's barely enough
to afford

410
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:02,685
The clams arreganata
every friday night at guido's.

411
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:04,997
So I work a little security

412
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,279
When my money clip
runs a little light.

413
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,321
What's the calamity?

414
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:11,660
Well, Trent was
working with cops.

415
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:13,551
Cops were moonlighting
as security.

416
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,593
You have
firsthand knowledge.

417
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:19,275
You took a powder
on the stakeout, right?

418
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:22,354
So I'm coming to you.

419
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:25,361
You coming to me 'cause
you think i might be complicit?

420
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:31,732
It's the first I'm hearing
about cops being involved.

421
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,360
Well, Hunt isn't with me
on this,

422
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:38,626
But, uh, i got an eyewitness
that says so.

423
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:44,833
You should talk to Crocker.

424
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:47,546
The A.D.A.?
-If Hunt's stonewalling,

425
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,435
You're gonna need a friend
on the outside.

426
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:55,921
Why are you doing this for me,
going around hunt?

427
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,569
Hunt was my hook
to second grade.

428
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,185
For three years,
I carried his water.

429
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,570
Lot of good that did me
when you showed up.

430
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:11,795
Crocker's a little too
bucking-for-sainthood

431
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:13,980
For my liking,
but he's a straight shooter.

432
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,483
He'll know what to do.
Give him a try.

433
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,222
And you think cops
from the 1-2-5 are involved?

434
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,390
Well, I don't know.

435
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:26,829
Hunt's made it hard
to get any traction,

436
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,883
So that's why
I'm talking to you.

437
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,784
I'll have one of
my investigators look into it.

438
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,651
Should take
some of the pressure off.

439
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:37,156
I appreciate the help,
not to mention your discretion.

440
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:38,626
Of course.

441
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,497
Heck of a way to introduce
yourself to a new house.

442
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,194
You don't know
the half of it.

451
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:17,885
<i>Maya? Maya?</i>

452
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:20,879
<i>You in here?</i>

453
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:24,519
<i>Boo! </i>

454
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:26,617
<i>I'll remember that</i>

455
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:29,169
<i>Next time you want me to work
a uniform detail for you.</i>

456
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:31,883
<i>Who says "Boo"
in this day and age?</i>

457
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:33,607
<i>You're like
a cartoon character</i>

458
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:37,527
<i>From the funny papers. Who says
"Funny papers"in this day and age?</i>

459
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:39,543
<i>Like in the funny papers.</i>

460
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:44,000
<i>Light some candels,
Run a bath.</i>

461
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,366
<i>I miss you , Maya.</i>

462
00:25:45,383 --> 00:25:48,082
<i>No internet, no dvd,
no video games...</i>

463
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,494
<i>Oh, but I don't want to live
in a world without video games.</i>

464
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,882
<i>You're kinda
killing the mood.</i>

466
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,619
Hey, 2B!

467
00:26:15,404 --> 00:26:17,537
Hey.
I whipped up a tray

468
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:20,842
Of "welcome to the second floor"
lasagna for you.

469
00:26:21,572 --> 00:26:23,890
Well, that's,
Uh, very nice of you.

470
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:26,654
What's nice is
I'm about to introduce you

471
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:30,337
To the most luxurious lasagna
you've ever tasted.

472
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,351
Not to toot my own horn-
It's my mom's recipe-

473
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:34,487
But it's guaranteed
to cure what ails you.

474
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:36,804
That jerk you brought home
last night stole your watch?

475
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,804
Just have a slice
of mom's lasagna.

476
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,397
The war in Vietnam
got you down?

477
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,952
Just taste
that smooth ricotta cheese.

478
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,574
How you doing today?

479
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,883
Like some mom's lasagna
will hit the spot.

480
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:48,710
Hooray. It's a garden mix.

481
00:26:49,218 --> 00:26:51,883
There's fresh tomatoes,
zucchini, carrots,

482
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:54,593
Peas, plenty of herbs,

483
00:26:54,594 --> 00:27:00,048
And i add a healthy sprinkling
of Mary Jane's magic earth.

484
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:02,795
Mary Jane's magic earth?

485
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,492
No recipe is complete
without it.

486
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:08,069
There's Marijuana in here?

487
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,535
It's mellow,
nothing like the blue de hue

488
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:13,802
I had at my friend Randy's
pig roast. You know i'm a cop.

489
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:16,492
<i>Then you must get
the really good stuff.</i>

490
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,626
Um, there's something
I've been meaning to ask.

491
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,305
What you said the other day
about sending messages

492
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,297
Back to loved ones
through the clouds...

493
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,276
Yeah?

494
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:30,437
Well...

495
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:34,643
Do the clouds ever respond?

496
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:36,368
Nope.

497
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:40,203
It's just a one-way thing.
I never hear from the clouds.

498
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:43,496
But the stars-
they won't shut up.

499
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:46,178
My mom, my dad,
my brother Gregory,

500
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,313
My best friend Lolly-

501
00:27:47,314 --> 00:27:50,017
They all send their love to me
through the stars.

502
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:54,700
Because the stars speak
for the lonely, blue hearts,

503
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:56,780
And lonely, blue hearts
tell the truth.

504
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,904
I gotta run.

505
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,213
Enjoy the las'.

506
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,816
And don't forget,
we still gotta dance.

507
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,640
As they say in New Orleans...

508
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,754
Bayou.

509
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:24,730
There he is, fellas.

510
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,053
Great.

511
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,142
Ahem.

512
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,330
There he is.

513
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,425
We should string him up
from the rafters

514
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,047
By his sneaky little rat-tail.

515
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:40,562
What's going on?

516
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:44,158
What's going on?
look at him play possum now.

517
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,478
Rats, possums... what did I
tell you about analogies, Ray?

518
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,159
The Loot just got off
the phone with Crocker.

519
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:55,912
Oh, yeah.

520
00:28:58,226 --> 00:28:59,509
Wow.

521
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,993
Nice work, Tyler.
Yeah, way to go, buddy.

522
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:06,478
Unbelievable, huh?

523
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:12,714
Did you really think
it wouldn't get back to me?

524
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,598
Good luck.
Yeah, tell me about it.

525
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,784
Listen, bob,
did you get my e-mail?

526
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
It's right here.

527
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:23,661
Real.

528
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:32,501
Unreal.

529
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:38,194
Real.

530
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,513
Print it out, would ya?

531
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:46,048
Unreal.

532
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,652
Sam, June's awake.

533
00:30:04,294 --> 00:30:04,963
Are you okay?

534
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,028
They're not real.
What are you talking about?

535
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:12,510
The reason why I can't track
down the cops working with Trent

536
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,084
Isn't because
Hunt's been stonewalling.

537
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:16,951
It's because they don't exist.
Sam, you're not making any sense.

538
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:19,771
The cops from
the check cashing robberies-

539
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:21,445
They're impersonators.

540
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:23,369
Impersonators?

541
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,675
They're not real cops.

542
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,347
So the sawbones says

543
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:33,564
You're gonna be
right as rain in no time. Okay?

544
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,391
Yeah.

545
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,821
I'm still not clear
what happened.

546
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:41,714
What happened was I took care of
the guy that did this to you,

547
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,232
Shot him dead.

548
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:45,586
Who?

549
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:47,798
Kim Trent.

550
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,230
Did you know Kim Trent?

551
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:59,249
No. But you cleaned his cell of vomit.

552
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,284
Remember?

553
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:04,635
What were you doing
outside triple "A" money, June?

554
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,918
What's wrong with you?

555
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:07,605
June seems emotional.

556
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:10,930
Of course she's emotional.
she was shot.

557
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:13,189
That's not the kind of emotional
I'm talking about. Hey, hey!

558
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,533
Look at her.

559
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:20,901
Kim's dead?

560
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,584
Yeah, he died on the scene

561
00:31:25,365 --> 00:31:27,072
From a gunshot wound
to the chest.

562
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:31,829
That's why you were there
with the police radio.

563
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:34,450
You weren't responding
to the call,

564
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,307
'Cause you were already there
as a lookout

565
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:39,129
And the getaway driver.

566
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,504
No. I just got the radio.

567
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:43,588
For Kim.

568
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:46,001
Yes. I mean no.

569
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:47,965
Kim loves me.

570
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:50,851
It took a while,
but we found each other.

571
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:53,861
We hadn't seen each other
since high school in Yonkers,

572
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:56,230
And then there he was,
outside of the precinct,

573
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:58,440
And he looked me up.
That's the kind of guy he was.

574
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:02,795
And you fed him information.
-Kim's gone, June.

575
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:06,644
It's time to start worrying
about yourself. I told Kim things-

576
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,280
Who was working,
where and when.

577
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,321
Eventually I was able
to pinch some uniforms

578
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:13,862
And some dupe shields.

579
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,753
No one noticed.
No one ever noticed.

580
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:18,832
Nobody noticed me except Kim.

581
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:22,019
And the radio message that
called off Chris and Ray-

582
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,506
That was you?

583
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,087
Yes.

584
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,984
I thought you always wanted
to join me on the bureau.

585
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:29,561
And be like you-

586
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,930
Taking the same crap,
day after day?

587
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:36,520
You're fooling yourself
if you ever think

588
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,139
They'll accept you
as one of them.

589
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,941
Junie, you know who
was fooling themselves?

590
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,287
This, um...

591
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:54,878
Listen to me.

592
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:03,785
I know what it feels like
to be alone.

593
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,803
It's like
someone's stolen away

594
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:12,017
The one thing in the world
you cared most about.

595
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,926
It happened
to me, too.

596
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,008
The universe
knocked me sideways

597
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,585
And took away everything

598
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:27,853
And everyone
I ever cared about.

599
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,755
You and me...

600
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,481
We have the same
lonely, blue heart, June.

601
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:41,132
Yeah.

602
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:44,715
I guess I do have
a lonely, blue heart.

603
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,212
Yeah.

604
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,160
Kim told me things. uh...

605
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,964
He was working with two guys,
uh...

606
00:33:57,683 --> 00:34:00,008
Dax Benson
and Freddy Gerard.

607
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,388
Okay. Do you know
where we can find them?

608
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:08,254
I promised Kim
I wouldn't say anything.

609
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,988
June, June, I'm sorry,
but it wasn't real.

610
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:18,576
What you think you had
with Trent was not real.

611
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:21,449
You're protecting
the same man

612
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,132
Who put you
in this hospital bed.

613
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,709
He's killed four innocent
people. Do you understand?

614
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:28,671
It's time
to tell us everything.

615
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,759
'Cause lonely, blue hearts
tell the truth.

616
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,810
Get down!
Oolice! don't move!

617
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:04,081
You are surrounded
by armed bastards.

618
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,026
On the deck.

620
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,226
Dax Benson!
Hold it right there.

621
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:42,243
Put your feet on the ground.
Put your hands on your head.

622
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:43,612
You are under arrest.

623
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:46,834
Just in time, boys.

624
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:49,258
Drop it.
No, no, no, no! whoa!

625
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:50,113
Ohh!

626
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,743
I'm on the job!

627
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:55,842
I'm a cop! he's not!

628
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,503
I'm real! he's not!
Get off me!

629
00:36:00,143 --> 00:36:01,064
Uhh!

630
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:04,207
Real cops don't run away.

631
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:07,465
Lieutenant Gene Hunt,

632
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:08,926
1-2-5.

633
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:09,609
What?

634
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,644
Kindly get off of my man.

635
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:18,966
Shut up.

636
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:23,962
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Move.

637
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:25,071
This is why Trent's crew

638
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,568
Hit so many
Check cashing stores so quick.

639
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:30,307
They needed cash 'cause there
was a shipment on the way.

640
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:33,680
All right, you two,
Let's go.

641
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:41,181
Heroin...
Yahtzee!

642
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:42,352
And lots of it.

643
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:44,096
Move over.
Come on.

644
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,973
All right, step up.

645
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,285
You did good, Tyler.

646
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,505
But next time you start
having words with an A.D.A.,

647
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,621
You make damn sure
I know ahead of time.

648
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,994
See you tomorrow, boss.

649
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:33,633
We'll be out of here
in five.

650
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:38,841
Once again, you walk io
the space I was headed for.

651
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:44,004
You and I are not gonna
Get along, are we?

652
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:44,781
Nope.

653
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:48,745
Eventually,
I will burn you down,

654
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:52,336
And I will bag your ashes,
And I will bury your ashes

655
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,992
In the yard
where my big dog craps big crap.

656
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,500
Anyway, wow.

657
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,776
I asked you for help.

658
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,994
You made me out to be a rat.
It wasn't like that.

659
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:11,283
Gene has a way
of doing things.

660
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,493
I have a way
of dealing with him.

661
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:15,332
It's nothing personal.

662
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:19,210
Sam, he's right.

663
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,525
It's complicated
dealing with Hunt.

664
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:23,777
You of all people
should know that.

665
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:27,798
What's that?

666
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,625
Oh, um,

667
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:33,164
Well, Lee got us tickets
to see "Grease."

668
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,774
You know, it's been
playing for a year,

669
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,667
And I've been dying
to see it, so...

670
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:41,666
Summer lovin'.
Had me a blast.

671
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:45,977
I got a dinner to get to.

672
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:47,743
I'll see you later, Annie.

673
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,917
Sam.

674
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:54,817
You okay, Sam?

675
00:38:55,593 --> 00:38:57,952
Yeah. Fine.

676
00:38:59,093 --> 00:38:59,393
Sam?

677
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:04,489
You're a good cop, Sam.

678
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,525
There's less heroinon the street

679
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,127
'Cause you're
in the 1-2-5.

680
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,079
And that is very real.

681
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:16,689
Good night, Annie.

682
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,188
Good night, Sam.

683
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,594
<i>I miss you, too, baby.</i>

684
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:48,015
<i>I miss you, too,</i>

685
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,858
<i>From the bottom of
my lonely, blue heart.</i>

686
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:04,564
Time to dance, 2B.
