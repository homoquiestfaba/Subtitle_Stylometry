1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:04,305
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:16,645
(suspenseful music)

3
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:23,029
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)

4
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,076
(crickets chirping)
(dogs barking)

5
00:03:58,658 --> 00:03:59,918
- Well, of course no one really believes

6
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:02,503
in the old Devil of the middle ages,

7
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,760
with horns and a pitchfork.

8
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,808
Anymore than people
really believe God looks

9
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,598
like the old man painted on the ceiling

10
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,345
of the Sistine Chapel.

11
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:11,646
- My point exactly.

12
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:12,479
Gin.

13
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,396
- You win again Robert.

14
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,276
- I don't question the
existence of evil Sam

15
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:19,388
just of supernatural evil.

16
00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:21,176
- But if you believe in miracles--

17
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:24,447
(doorbell ringing)

18
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,114
- Who could that be?

19
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:31,372
(doorbell ringing)

20
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,574
Where is that girl?

21
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:33,407
Kathryn?

22
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,972
(doorbell ringing)

23
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,381
That girl.

24
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,798
Such a good girl.

25
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:47,819
- Mrs. Grove?

26
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:48,652
- Yes.

27
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,261
- It's not that I don't believe
in Heaven you understand,

28
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,323
it just that all the
most interesting people

29
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:57,716
seems to me would end
up in the other place.

30
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:58,780
- Oh Robert.

31
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,613
- What?

32
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:02,012
What is it?

33
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,068
- Nothing.

34
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:08,975
- Miss Lester what's your
opinion on the subject of Hell?

35
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,788
Miss Lester?

36
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:14,459
- I have no opinion on
the subject Mr. Delaney.

37
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,120
- I think it must be a
very interesting place.

38
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,570
- Excuse me everyone.

39
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,460
I'd like for you all
to meet Mrs. Albright.

40
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,547
She's going to be staying with us.

41
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:26,687
- Hello.
- Hello.

42
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,520
- [Miss Lester] Hello.

43
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,726
- Oh here let me run it down for you,

44
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:31,892
There's Miss Lester, she
teaches at the Oak Grove school.

45
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:32,725
- [Miss Lester] Hi.

46
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:33,813
- And there are the Delaneys,

47
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,909
Mr. Delaney is in insurance.

48
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,240
- We're pleased to meet you.

49
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,073
- Thank you.

50
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:39,974
- Oh and our bachelors,

51
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,918
This is our young Mr. Reynolds,

52
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,184
he's going to Boston tomorrow.

53
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:47,184
- Ah, I have many friends in Boston.

54
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,170
- Pleasure.

55
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,404
- And this is our--

56
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:52,714
- Our not so young Mr. Gray.

57
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:55,078
You can call me Sam.

58
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:57,078
Please, sit down Mrs. Albright.

59
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:58,811
- Why thank you Sam.

60
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,561
You may call me Lucy.

61
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,037
- I'll do so frequently.

62
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:04,367
(chuckles)

63
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,678
- I'll have to watch out for you.

64
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:09,937
- No need, he's all hot air that Sam Gray.

65
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,520
So tell us Mrs. Albright, Lucy,

66
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:16,596
What's your opinion on
the subject of the Devil?

67
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:18,117
- The Devil?

68
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:22,284
Well, he must be rather difficult
to be around I'd imagine.

69
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:25,331
- Well there's an answer that doesn't

70
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,855
leave much room for doubt.

71
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,219
- The question is, do you actually believe

72
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,613
the Devil is at work in the world today?

73
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,495
Sending demons here and there?

74
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,162
- Well that is quite a question.

75
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,578
- Thank you for finally joining us.

76
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,744
Didn't you hear the door ring?

77
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,464
- No Aunt Mary I was in the kitchen.

78
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,171
- Why is it that I never have any problem

79
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,592
hearing the door from the kitchen

80
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:53,972
but it always poses such
a challenge for you?

81
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,945
- I don't know Aunt Mary.

82
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:57,441
I'm sorry Aunt Mary.

83
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,762
- Well we have a new guest.

84
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:01,275
Get another cup please.

85
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,390
Would you like tea or coffee?

86
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,485
- [Mrs. Albright] Why tea
would be lovely thank you.

87
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,068
- Don't just stand about go on.

88
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,194
That girl.

89
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,349
Oh, paper dolls.

90
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,373
You know I used to cut
out paper dolls like that

91
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:17,941
when I was a young girl.

92
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,269
- Well I'm afraid paper dolls

93
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,460
are all I can manage these days.

94
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,043
The hands you know?

95
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,878
- But it doesn't have a face.

96
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,711
- Oh the face always goes on last.

97
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:30,891
- The point I was trying to make

98
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:35,058
is that if God has miracles
then Satan must too mustn't he?

99
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:39,141
- I suppose you might be right.

100
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,158
- The trouble is miracles aren't

101
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,815
what they used to be are they?

102
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:43,581
No voice from the heavens,

103
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:46,768
no Red Seas parting,
no fire and brimstone.

104
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:49,692
- Frankly, I think thou
dost protest too much,

105
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,275
Mr. Reynolds is it?

106
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:56,426
I think you really want to believe.

107
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,288
- You're wrong Mrs. Albright,

108
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:00,034
I want to know.

109
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,330
There's a difference.

110
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,311
- Well then I'll tell you what I think.

111
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,195
If the Devil has one great power on Earth,

112
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,005
it's the power to persuade men and women

113
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:13,005
to do what they secretly want to do.

114
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,048
- So be warned.

115
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,391
- Yes.

116
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,825
Fair warning.

117
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:22,992
(chuckles)
(ominous music)

118
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,615
(ominous music)

119
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,809
(screaming and weeping)

120
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,208
Where are you?

121
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,579
Ah, there you are.

122
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,676
Row impede, row impede,

123
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,027
quickly bring me what I need.

124
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,681
(ominous music)
(whimpering)

125
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:00,711
Go.

126
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:12,732
- She lives,

127
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,417
she lives in the house.

128
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,730
She lives in the house.

129
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,480
He lives in the town.

130
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,399
They live in the kitty?

131
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,243
Kitty?

132
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,426
(sighs)

133
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,491
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

134
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:34,324
Hell.

135
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:47,387
- [Robert] I don't understand
what the problem is.

136
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,151
It's perfectly simple,

137
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,164
a five year old could do it.

138
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:52,831
Monday is the pearl.

139
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,782
Please say it.

140
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,358
- [Both] Monday is the pearl.

141
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:01,149
Tuesday the inlaid silver.

142
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,128
Wednesday the bronze,

143
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,461
and Thursday is.

144
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:06,555
- Coat of arms.

145
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,656
- The coat of arms.

146
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:11,078
- [Both] Friday is polished silver.

147
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,136
Saturday the tiger eye,

148
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,803
and Sunday the gold.

149
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,776
- [Robert] And today is what?

150
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,109
- It's Thursday.

151
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,687
- Then can you explain to me,

152
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:27,261
why I had to go to work
today with the inlaid silver?

153
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,103
Is this too much for you?

154
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,150
Am I asking too much?

155
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,825
Is this too much for you to handle?

156
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,068
- It's just that we were late,

157
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:38,373
I was late and rushed and I just forgot.

158
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,833
- It's like living with a child.

159
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:45,146
All I want in my life is a
tiny little bit of order.

160
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:46,185
Just a bit.

161
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,018
Something!

162
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,723
I thought that I had married a woman,

163
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:54,640
instead I discover that
I have married a child.

164
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,032
Isn't that what you are?

165
00:12:58,032 --> 00:12:58,865
Isn't it?

166
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:02,227
(sobbing)

167
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:04,394
Yes, that's a good answer.

168
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,643
Cry like a baby.

169
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:07,555
Just cry!

170
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:08,388
Please!

171
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:11,210
- Robert I love you!

172
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,237
- That's fine.

173
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:16,874
That makes everything
all right doesn't it?

174
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:19,624
(downbeat music)

175
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:14,192
- Move on to the next,

176
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,429
we won't be getting anything more

177
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,429
out of Mr. Gray tonight.

178
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,732
(shaky breathing)

179
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:52,710
- Okay now remember,

180
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,190
no amount of belief makes a fact.

181
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,704
The world wasn't one less bit round

182
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:59,981
when everyone believed it was flat was it?

183
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:02,795
The question isn't whether
we believe in a God,

184
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:04,772
but whether there really is one.

185
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,130
(shaky breathing)

186
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,047
Am I right?

187
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,790
- Yes Mr. Reynolds,

188
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,207
we'll have to start with you.

189
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,079
(mischievous music)

190
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:22,033
(ominous music)

191
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:21,191
(knocking)

192
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:37,879
- [Will] Mrs. Albright?

193
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,599
- I'm very very sorry to
wake you Mr. Reynolds.

194
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,682
- It's uh ...

195
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,162
What's wrong?

196
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,419
- It's my luggage you see.

197
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,420
- Excuse me?

198
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,099
- The men brought it from the station

199
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:51,661
and it's piled up outside.

200
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,442
I didn't want to wake anybody,

201
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:54,288
but I'm afraid I--

202
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:55,205
- That's...

203
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:58,023
- Would you mind?

204
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,606
- No, no just give me a minute.

205
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:03,778
- Thank you so much.

206
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:14,747
- There.

207
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:15,580
All set.

208
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,639
Now if you'll excuse me I have to get up

209
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,757
very early in the morning.

210
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:21,522
- Mr. Reynolds?

211
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:23,855
What would you give to know?

212
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,865
- Excuse me?

213
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:29,106
- What would you give to know?

214
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:32,417
Really know, that's there's a God,

215
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,084
a Devil, a life beyond this one.

216
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,198
- Well, my bank account's a little slim

217
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:40,352
right now Mrs. Albright.

218
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,802
- You think I'm making
clever conversation.

219
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:44,635
I'm not.

220
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,704
What would you give me
if I could prove say,

221
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:49,454
that demons are real.

222
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:52,162
What would you give?

223
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,621
If I could do that?

224
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:56,788
(sighs)

225
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:58,474
- Mrs. Albright.

226
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:01,895
- Wouldn't it be worth just
about anything to know?

227
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:02,728
For sure?

228
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:04,794
- I suppose.

229
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,747
- Is it a deal then?

230
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:09,227
- I'm sorry?

231
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:12,538
- Will you give me anything I ask for?

232
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,121
If I can prove to you
that demons are real?

233
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,624
- Why not?

234
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,761
Anything you want.

235
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,474
If you can convince me,

236
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,557
but I'm hard to convince.

237
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,281
What's that?

238
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,548
- Ivy leaf

239
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,783
It keeps the noise from leaving the room.

240
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:34,232
We don't want to disturb the others do we?

241
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:35,197
- I don't know.

242
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,171
Why not let everyone in on it?

243
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:40,171
- No no, tonight is just between us.

244
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:53,440
Mr. Reynolds, would you help me unbutton

245
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,773
the back of my dress please?

246
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,250
- Now Mrs. Albright.

247
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,420
- Oh please, do you really think

248
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,389
I intend something improper?

249
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:07,064
- Well, I mean no but...

250
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,821
- Then come over here.

251
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:11,071
I wanna show you something.

252
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:13,814
Come come.

253
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,596
Undo the back of my dress please.

254
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,263
(ominous music)

255
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:41,932
- What the?

256
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,469
- Unlace the stitches would you please?

257
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:45,302
- I'm sorry?

258
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,166
- Unlace the stitches.

259
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,916
(dramatic music)

260
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,418
You know what I am don't you?

261
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,249
- Yes.

262
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:40,004
- So I've convinced you haven't I?

263
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:42,916
- Yes.

264
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,944
Oh God please help me.

265
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,304
- No no no, you made your bargain.

266
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:58,259
You know what you might've had,

267
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,018
and you know what you've lost.

268
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:01,851
Come.

269
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,952
No, crawl.

270
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,992
Closer.

271
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,529
Now you must give me what I want.

272
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:24,082
Your hand please.

273
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,082
(suspenseful music)

274
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,498
(pained groans)

275
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,566
You may struggle if you like.

276
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:12,760
It won't make any difference.

277
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,093
(screaming)

278
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:24,994
(clock ticking)

279
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,376
- Why I can't understand it.

280
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:39,796
He must've left early before breakfast.

281
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:40,757
- It's strange.

282
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:43,638
I was up early, I didn't hear him go.

283
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:46,281
- Well he's not here
now so he must've left.

284
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,173
- He told me he was going
to take an early train.

285
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,495
- Really?

286
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:54,328
Didn't know there were
any trains before noon.

287
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,164
- My goodness you're as
nervous as a jumping bean.

288
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:07,493
- I'm sorry ma'am, can
I get you something?

289
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:10,177
- Oh no no I just wanted a cup of tea.

290
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:12,019
No sit honey sit.

291
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,740
- I'm sorry ma'am I'm sorry.

292
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,254
Oh that's all right.

293
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,421
- Dammit!

294
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,550
I'm sorry.

295
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,152
- Don't be silly.

296
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:21,001
I've heard much worse.

297
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,062
Here let me see.

298
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,562
Oh it's nothing but a scratch.

299
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:31,464
Well now my, isn't that interesting.

300
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:32,562
- Ma'am?

301
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:34,145
- Your palm, may I?

302
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:38,556
You know you can learn a
great deal about someone

303
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:40,473
by studying their palm.

304
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,679
- I went to a gypsy once.

305
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,679
She said I'd get rich, but I didn't.

306
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:51,026
- I see you've been keeping a secret.

307
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:51,859
- A secret?

308
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,370
- Mmm Hmm.

309
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,370
Right there.

310
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,517
In your room.

311
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:01,825
Why, you don't know how to read.

312
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:04,304
- I can read fine.

313
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:08,927
- I've hurt your feelings I'm sorry,

314
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,510
don't be like that.

315
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:14,845
Would you like to know a secret of mine?

316
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:16,855
I'll tell you.

317
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:23,823
I was older than you are
now when I learned to read.

318
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:26,646
- Really?

319
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:28,056
- Yes.

320
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:29,306
It wasn't easy.

321
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:32,231
- I know, sometimes ...

322
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:39,406
- You'd like to be like other
young girls wouldn't you?

323
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,457
- Smart like them you mean.

324
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,290
Yes.

325
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:50,349
- When I was young I wanted so
much to be like other girls,

326
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:54,794
but I was slow.

327
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,242
They'd laugh at me behind my back.

328
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:05,017
Sometimes to my face.

329
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,849
- I know, I hear 'em.

330
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:12,461
I'd do just about anything to be able to

331
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:13,878
not be so stupid.

332
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:19,727
- If that's the way you really feel,

333
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,777
then I can help you.

334
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:24,444
Is that the way you really feel?

335
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:27,078
- Yes ma'am.

336
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:31,245
Sometimes I see a smart
girl talking about things,

337
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,690
talking smart to men
and I wish I could just,

338
00:25:38,113 --> 00:25:40,733
I don't know I wish I could just kill her

339
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:43,400
and steal her smarts for myself.

340
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:50,952
- Would you like to know my secret?

341
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:52,946
- Yes ma'am.

342
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,869
- It's a special book.

343
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:00,036
I always carry it with me.

344
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,625
- The words are too big.

345
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,566
I can't read those big--

346
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,733
- Yes you can.

347
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,177
Concentrate.

348
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,942
Look at it hard.

349
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,530
You can read them.

350
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:26,299
- A Concise and Illustrated
history of The Earth King.

351
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:31,160
Why I read it.

352
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,076
Every word.

353
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,177
- Take it.

354
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:36,921
Read it.

355
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,708
I know you'll like it.

356
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:44,074
- Kathryn have you finished
the silverware yet?

357
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:45,685
- I'm afraid I was bothering her.

358
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,228
- Oh no problem.

359
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:50,048
Kathryn knows the work she's to do.

360
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,922
Don't bother with that there's
a spill in the sitting room.

361
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:54,020
Well go on!

362
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,209
Get some rags.

363
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:56,042
Hurry up.

364
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,567
- [Robert] Gin.

365
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:28,662
- You win again.

366
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,264
- Yes, what's the point
in even playing with you?

367
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:33,055
Would anyone else care for a game?

368
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,202
Mr. Gray?

369
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,702
- Oh no thank you.

370
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:40,692
- Miss Lester, would you care to play?

371
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,775
Cards I mean.

372
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,953
- No thank you.

373
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,235
I'll say goodnight.

374
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:56,408
- I think I'll go to bed too.

375
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:01,412
- A strange thing Mrs. Albright.

376
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:02,607
- What's that?

377
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:04,516
- I remember what you
said about Will Reynolds

378
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,558
wanted to catch an earlier train.

379
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,204
- Hmm?

380
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:09,939
- I called the station,

381
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,381
there weren't any trains before noon.

382
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,214
- Really?

383
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:15,906
Well then I suppose poor Mr. Reynolds

384
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:19,355
had a long wait after all didn't he?

385
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,522
- So it seems.

386
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,271
- Well, goodnight all.

387
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:31,163
(ominous music)

388
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:45,877
(toilet flushing)

389
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:51,532
- Oh!

390
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:52,365
Sorry.

391
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:56,566
(shushing)

392
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,228
- Um.

393
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:07,407
(shushing)

394
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,240
- Wait.

395
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,367
When she goes to sleep,

396
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,903
come to my room.

397
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,179
I'll let you fuck me.

398
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,267
(mischievous music)

399
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,237
(gasping in surprise)

400
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,262
(screaming)

401
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,164
- What?

402
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:20,328
What?

403
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:21,596
Wait, oh sweet Jesus.

404
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:22,628
My wife, you'll wake the whole house.

405
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:24,672
(shushing)

406
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:25,505
What's wrong?

407
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,600
(squealing)

408
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,352
My God what's the matter with you?

409
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,185
(screaming)

410
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,380
No, no no no no, don't!

411
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,325
Don't do this to me!

412
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,161
(shushing)

413
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,154
What did I do?

414
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:34,987
Stop!

415
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:35,820
Stop!

416
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,776
(gunshot)

417
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:44,109
(screaming)

418
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:49,512
(gasping and screaming)

419
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,070
- Oh, my goodness.

420
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,197
What's happened?

421
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:01,947
- He, he, he tried to assault me.

422
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:03,640
Oh my God.

423
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,890
(shushing)

424
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,129
- Go back to your room.

425
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:10,962
- Call the police.

426
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,434
We have to call the police.

427
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:14,402
- No it's all right.

428
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:16,733
Go back to your room.

429
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:19,316
We don't wanna wake the others.

430
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:23,764
- But the shot and I screamed.

431
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,958
- It's all right.

432
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,791
Go on.

433
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:31,101
- But he's still inside.

434
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,684
- I'll be with you.

435
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:36,163
(shushing)

436
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:38,830
(ominous music)

437
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:19,407
Ah, there you are.

438
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,388
- That woman.

439
00:34:25,388 --> 00:34:28,787
That woman is insane she shot me!

440
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:32,149
- He came into my room
he tried to assault me!

441
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:33,954
He tore my nightgown!

442
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:35,228
- She invited me!

443
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:37,717
She's flirted with me
ever since she got here!

444
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:40,390
She invited me, she gave me
the key and then she shot me

445
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,803
because she's insane.

446
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:43,186
- You!

447
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:45,077
You despicable thing!

448
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:46,279
- Oh God!

449
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,112
Oh God.

450
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,803
- Miss Lester, I think we
should move Mr. Delaney

451
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:54,636
out of your room, don't you agree?

452
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:00,624
Now do you think you can help me?

453
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,896
- Let me get my robe.

454
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:14,135
- Mr. Delaney, we're going
to walk you to my room.

455
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:15,468
- Don't move me.

456
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:20,748
Do you really want your
wife to find you here?

457
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:24,695
Then come along.

458
00:35:34,705 --> 00:35:38,622
Let's sit him down at
the edge of the bed here.

459
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:43,206
Now Miss Lester, go back to your room.

460
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,638
- But the police, but we have to call them

461
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:47,736
and what can I do?
- Miss Lester,

462
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,486
go back to your room.

463
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,122
(groaning in pain)

464
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:03,289
- Please, call the doctor.

465
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:14,192
- Mr. Delaney, you might as well know,

466
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:17,677
at the rate you're bleeding
you'll be dead in a few minutes.

467
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,103
All a doctor will be able to do

468
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:22,486
is sign your death certificate.

469
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:24,282
- Ah Christ!

470
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,777
She gave me the key.

471
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,716
I swear I didn't try to assault her.

472
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:29,383
Please, get my wife.

473
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:33,358
- Do you want to die?

474
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,447
- What?

475
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,709
- Do you want to die Mr. Delaney?

476
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:38,968
- What are you talking about
you just told me that--

477
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:42,232
- Isn't this a shocking waste?

478
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,982
Wouldn't you like another chance.

479
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,449
- What?

480
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,810
- Wouldn't you do anything
if I could make that

481
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,477
bullet hole go away?

482
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,544
If I could heal you, if
I could save your life,

483
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,124
what would it be worth to you?

484
00:37:00,124 --> 00:37:01,352
- My life?

485
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,519
You're as crazy as she is.

486
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,417
- Roll over.

487
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:08,255
- What?

488
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:10,543
- You don't believe me I'll show you.

489
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:13,441
Roll over onto your side.

490
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,358
(groaning in pain)

491
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:33,009
- What in God's name are you doing?

492
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:36,009
(liquid squelching)

493
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:45,093
- That's got the bleeding stopped.

494
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:45,926
Look.

495
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,510
- What did you do?

496
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,149
- Just wound back the bleeding a bit.

497
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:54,654
- But it still hurts.

498
00:37:54,654 --> 00:37:56,681
- The bullet is still in there.

499
00:37:56,681 --> 00:37:58,767
It has to come out.

500
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,698
Do you want me to take it out?

501
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:02,656
- Yes of course!

502
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,406
- Well then, what'll you give me?

503
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,067
- I don't know.

504
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,504
All I have, anything.

505
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:12,421
I'll give you anything.

506
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:14,724
- Good.

507
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:16,141
Lie still please.

508
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:36,176
(yelling in pain)

509
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:51,422
- What is that thing?

510
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,784
- What this?

511
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:58,367
I suppose it's just
some kind of a fashion.

512
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,137
- A fashion?

513
00:39:01,137 --> 00:39:02,793
- Yes a fashion.

514
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:06,832
If I offered to cure you by
making passes over your stomach,

515
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:08,776
or by shaking a corn rattle,

516
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:11,859
you'd think I was crazy wouldn't you?

517
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:18,623
Now this is much more in
keeping with the times,

518
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,701
wouldn't you say?

519
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:24,868
Medical, mechanical, a
certain scientific quality?

520
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:33,664
Every society has an acceptable form

521
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,983
for it's magic Mr. Delaney.

522
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:39,130
Whether it's dead cats
and tree stump water

523
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,973
or electrolitic catalisis
and radium treatments.

524
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:45,890
(groaning in pain)

525
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,512
They're all cloaks of course.

526
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:53,854
No one wants to look straight

527
00:39:53,854 --> 00:39:56,437
into the eye of the impossible.

528
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:18,745
- That's amazing.

529
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,094
How did you do that?

530
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:23,011
- Lie back down please.

531
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:27,470
(whimpering)

532
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:36,957
(screaming)

533
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,732
(gasps)

534
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:44,149
(whimpering)

535
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:59,211
(knocking)

536
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:04,800
- Mrs. Delaney, I--

537
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:09,519
- I cleaned up all the
blood in the hallway.

538
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,143
- Your husband, he--

539
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:12,511
- I know what he did.

540
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,299
We've got to get this place cleaned up.

541
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,708
Do you have a clean sheet, a blanket?

542
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:17,740
- What?

543
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,352
- Help me, all the sheets and blankets,

544
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,037
everything with blood on it.

545
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:24,120
We'll clean up the carpet afterwards.

546
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,238
- I don't understand.

547
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:30,758
- Do what I tell you.

548
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,076
Unless you want to go to jail.

549
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,263
- Jail?

550
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:35,518
- You know how the world works.

551
00:41:35,518 --> 00:41:36,797
What are the police?

552
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:37,749
Men.

553
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:39,409
The judges?

554
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:40,429
Men.

555
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:41,997
The juries?

556
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:43,418
Ah, men!

557
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,301
What do you think they'll believe?

558
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:47,718
- What can we do?

559
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,198
- Well no one else
knows but Mrs. Albright,

560
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:54,781
and she won't tell.

561
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:59,190
My husband is going to cease to exist.

562
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,143
- Oh my God!

563
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:04,967
- Robert's still alive
but he won't be for long.

564
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,448
When we're done here
we'll carry him outside

565
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:08,593
into the woods behind the house.

566
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,883
Tomorrow morning I'll call the police

567
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:11,272
and tell them that he went out for a walk

568
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:13,046
and never came back.

569
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:17,662
We'll make it look like he
was surprised by a thief.

570
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,857
- How can you speak about it so calmly?

571
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:22,512
- Speak about it?

572
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:25,790
I've been dreaming about
something like this for years!

573
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,630
Ever since I realized the
filthy thing I'd married.

574
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,503
The plans were already there.

575
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:35,510
I just needed something like
this to bring them to life.

576
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,847
Get undressed.

577
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:37,680
- What?

578
00:42:38,987 --> 00:42:41,582
- Look at you, you're covered in blood.

579
00:42:41,582 --> 00:42:42,675
Get undressed!

580
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:45,840
Put your clothes over there with the rest.

581
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,340
Unless you want the police to undress you.

582
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:53,364
Don't.

583
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:55,512
Your robe's covered in blood.

584
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:58,179
Put it over there with the rest.

585
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:00,166
Go over to the dresser.

586
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,804
I need to clean you off.

587
00:43:01,804 --> 00:43:02,637
Hurry up.

588
00:43:12,396 --> 00:43:13,739
No time to be shy.

589
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,000
We've got to be close.

590
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,716
Close as sisters.

591
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:18,883
- I've never had a sister.

592
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:23,808
Is it bloody on my back?

593
00:43:23,808 --> 00:43:25,664
- It's everywhere.

594
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:26,997
Did he hurt you?

595
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,189
- He tore my night dress.

596
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:33,474
He touched me.

597
00:43:35,186 --> 00:43:36,815
Touched me.

598
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:37,982
- Turn around.

599
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:46,898
- I'll do it.

600
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,647
I'm sorry, sorry!

601
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,863
- Is that what you want?

602
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:01,696
- No!

603
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:04,279
I didn't know what I was doing.

604
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:06,963
- I've spent the last 10 years rehearsing

605
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:09,463
my husband's death in my mind.

606
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:12,943
What have you been rehearsing in yours?

607
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:16,367
What do you think about
when you're all alone?

608
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:17,200
- Nothing.

609
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:20,054
- What are you afraid of?

610
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:23,283
We're going to be murderers together.

611
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:24,700
What do you want?

612
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:34,545
This is what you want isn't it?

613
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:35,378
Isn't it?

614
00:44:36,484 --> 00:44:37,317
- Yes.

615
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:38,773
- More than anything?

616
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:39,750
- Yes.

617
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,936
- Then you'll do anything, anything I ask?

618
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:45,420
- Yes.

619
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,670
- Will you be mine forever?

620
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:50,217
- Yes.

621
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,492
(ominous music)

622
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:14,966
- Do you think he's still alive?

623
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:16,383
- Are you afraid?

624
00:45:21,557 --> 00:45:23,974
- It's too late to be afraid.

625
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:32,422
- Oh it's never too late for that.

626
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:37,926
(ominous music)

627
00:45:41,443 --> 00:45:43,860
(whimpering)

628
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:22,892
- Robert?

629
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,163
Are you all right?

630
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,747
- Ellen I'm not blind.

631
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,122
I know what I am, I know
that I'm not a good man.

632
00:46:40,122 --> 00:46:41,442
- [Ellen] That's not true.

633
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:45,609
- I know that I haven't treated
you the way that I should,

634
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:49,137
but it's not gonna go on.

635
00:46:49,137 --> 00:46:50,926
We're gonna break out of this life.

636
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:54,535
We're gonna have a home
and servants and children.

637
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:58,283
We're gonna have the life that we deserve.

638
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,748
- We are?

639
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:03,389
- And you are gonna have the
husband that you deserve,

640
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:05,303
but we're gonna need courage.

641
00:47:05,303 --> 00:47:07,463
Do you have courage?

642
00:47:07,463 --> 00:47:09,139
- I don't know.

643
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:10,667
I thought I did once but I just--

644
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,932
- Ellen, look at me.

645
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:15,368
I'm not a good man, I'm
weak and I'm vindictive,

646
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:16,845
and I don't know how to love anything.

647
00:47:16,845 --> 00:47:18,178
Not even myself.

648
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:21,619
Do you love me?

649
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,113
- Yes Robert, you know I do.

650
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:27,946
I've never wanted anything
more than your love.

651
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:30,644
- I promise you nothing do you hear me?

652
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:34,811
Knowing that, will you
still do what I ask of you?

653
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:36,751
- Yes.

654
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:40,152
- No questions?

655
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,641
- No.

656
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:43,468
- Anything for me?

657
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:45,635
- Just tell me what to do.

658
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,814
- Mrs. Grove has no bank account.

659
00:47:57,993 --> 00:48:00,368
- Are you sure there isn't
anything I can do for you?

660
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:02,462
- No no, I'll be all right.

661
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,138
- Should I send Kathryn
up with the powder?

662
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:07,080
- No thank you Mrs. Grove,
I'm just going to lie down.

663
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,423
- All right.

664
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:10,161
- I'll try get home a bit early.

665
00:48:10,161 --> 00:48:12,161
- I'm sure I'll be fine.

666
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:21,152
- Mr. Delaney, where did
you say that Mr. Gray went?

667
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:22,183
- Something about trying to find

668
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:24,431
Miss Lester and Mrs. Albright.

669
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,325
Honestly I didn't quite understand him.

670
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:27,342
See you this evening.

671
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:29,842
- Have a good day Mr. Delaney.

672
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,033
Oh, Mr. Delaney?

673
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:33,816
- Hmm?

674
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:35,816
- Did you hurt yourself?

675
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:39,245
- Oh, no I just slept on it or something.

676
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:40,078
Good day.

677
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:03,960
- Oh good morning Mrs. Grove.

678
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,982
- Well good morning.

679
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:06,278
We missed you at breakfast.

680
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:07,957
- Well I needed some help with some things

681
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:10,230
and Miss Lester was very accommodating.

682
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,563
(chuckling)

683
00:49:18,618 --> 00:49:20,555
Mrs. Grove, I was wondering

684
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:23,042
if you might be able to help me.

685
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:23,946
- Oh well I don't--

686
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:27,547
- You see I just have no
head at all for money.

687
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,576
- For money?

688
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:29,409
- Yes.

689
00:49:29,409 --> 00:49:31,206
That's where Miss Lester
took me this morning,

690
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:33,011
to see a man at the bank?

691
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,594
You see Albert my dear
husband, he left me,

692
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:40,657
what are those things called?

693
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:41,490
Pillories.

694
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:43,846
No, um, stocks!

695
00:49:45,157 --> 00:49:46,690
(laughter)

696
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,193
That's it, yeah I have
quite a few of them,

697
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:51,015
and this man at the bank well he said

698
00:49:51,015 --> 00:49:53,450
I should put them in some
sort of box at the bank.

699
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,273
That I should put all
my money in the bank,

700
00:49:55,273 --> 00:49:57,094
but I don't know.

701
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,808
- No you should think twice.

702
00:49:58,808 --> 00:50:01,908
Banks fold you know ,and
then all your money is gone.

703
00:50:01,908 --> 00:50:03,621
- Yes exactly.

704
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:06,204
You see, you know all about it!

705
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:08,994
So I was wondering...

706
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:13,267
- Yes?

707
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:15,522
- Could you advise me?

708
00:50:15,522 --> 00:50:17,554
I don't want to impose but it would take

709
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:19,656
such a burden off of me if only someone

710
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:22,823
would just take care of it all for me.

711
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,407
- It would be a burden of course,

712
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:31,574
but I know how it is being
widowed and all myself.

713
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,318
I'd have to have free hand.

714
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:38,666
- Oh of course.

715
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:42,249
Of course I'd never
dream of taking charge.

716
00:50:44,413 --> 00:50:46,086
Are you busy right now?

717
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:49,120
I could show you what I have in my trunk.

718
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,897
Perhaps you could make some
sense out of it all for me.

719
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:55,296
- Oh I'm not doing anything really.

720
00:50:55,296 --> 00:50:58,242
I could spend a few moments.

721
00:50:58,242 --> 00:50:59,753
- Thank you so much.

722
00:50:59,753 --> 00:51:02,420
(ominous music)

723
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,606
No, this isn't right.

724
00:51:18,606 --> 00:51:20,736
I'm just taking advantage of you.

725
00:51:20,736 --> 00:51:22,026
You know what I'm going to do?

726
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:24,034
I'm going to put all my money in the bank.

727
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:25,256
I mean everyone does it.

728
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,092
- Now now now don't do that,

729
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:29,397
it's no bother for me really.

730
00:51:29,397 --> 00:51:30,734
- No I've made up my mind.

731
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:33,345
Why should I push my troubles onto you.

732
00:51:33,345 --> 00:51:35,497
- Now no, now I insist.

733
00:51:35,497 --> 00:51:38,185
If you feel that you're taking advantage,

734
00:51:38,185 --> 00:51:40,685
well we'll work something out.

735
00:51:43,662 --> 00:51:44,945
- Are you certain?

736
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:46,370
- Absolutely.

737
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,407
I want to do this.

738
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:50,231
We'll make an accommodation.

739
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:53,231
Something that's fair to both of us.

740
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:55,908
- Well I do want to be fair.

741
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,098
(laughter)

742
00:51:58,098 --> 00:51:58,931
All right.

743
00:52:00,488 --> 00:52:02,655
We'll, how did you put it?

744
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:06,632
We'll make an accommodation.

745
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:15,629
- [Mrs. Grove] Are you telling me

746
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:17,689
that you actually went to the police?

747
00:52:17,689 --> 00:52:19,524
- You're darn right I did.

748
00:52:19,524 --> 00:52:21,854
When Miss Lester didn't
show up at her classroom,

749
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:23,480
and no one's seen her since,

750
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,253
and there's no sign of
Will Reynolds either

751
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:27,426
of course I went to the police.

752
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:29,349
For all the good it did me.

753
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,556
- Well, what did they say?

754
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:34,756
- That they didn't have
sufficient grounds for action.

755
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:38,906
That they couldn't declare
them missing for 48 hours.

756
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,453
- And Mrs. Albright is missing too.

757
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:46,133
- I swear I think there's something,

758
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:49,315
something ungodly going on in this house.

759
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:51,603
- Well as soon as Mr.
Delaney gets home from work

760
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,273
I'm going to lock the door.

761
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:54,593
Mrs. Albright comes home later,

762
00:52:54,593 --> 00:52:58,791
she won't be able to get
in without waking someone.

763
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:00,570
- I'm going to my room.

764
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,420
If she does come back,
or Miss Lester does,

765
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,054
please wake me no matter what the hour.

766
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,221
- Don't worry.

767
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:14,437
Mrs. Albright won't be
murdering us in our beds.

768
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:16,563
- I hope you're right.

769
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:18,444
Good evening.

770
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:20,444
- Good evening Mr. Gray.

771
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,394
Oh Kathryn, as soon as
you're done cleaning up

772
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:34,052
please go to your room.

773
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:35,385
- Yes Aunt Mary.

774
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:38,867
Aunt Mary?

775
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:39,869
- Yes?

776
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:42,532
- Did you hurt yourself?

777
00:53:42,532 --> 00:53:45,260
- Stick to your business.

778
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,927
(ominous music)

779
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,647
(whimpering)

780
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,195
- Robert, I was...

781
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:34,459
I was so afraid, it's so late!

782
00:54:34,459 --> 00:54:36,713
- There were things I had to take care of.

783
00:54:36,713 --> 00:54:38,713
Things I had to arrange.

784
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,612
Are you ready?

785
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,666
- Yes.

786
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:44,709
- For anything?

787
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:46,160
- I don't understand.

788
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,789
- Listen carefully, Mrs.
Grove is in the sitting room.

789
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:53,651
I'm going to go there
and keep her occupied.

790
00:54:53,651 --> 00:54:57,818
While I do, you have to go to
her room and get the money.

791
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:01,175
- But I don't--

792
00:55:01,175 --> 00:55:03,226
- Do you love me?

793
00:55:03,226 --> 00:55:04,434
- [Ellen] Yes.

794
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,767
- Then don't ask questions, just listen.

795
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:14,154
There's a small table in
the corner on the far wall.

796
00:55:14,154 --> 00:55:16,611
There's a straight razor on top of it.

797
00:55:16,611 --> 00:55:20,349
Take the blade and slide it
along the top edge of the drawer

798
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:23,379
until you hit a hidden catch.

799
00:55:23,379 --> 00:55:27,046
Open the drawer, our
money is hidden inside.

800
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,755
Take it and put back everything
the way you found it.

801
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:35,505
Lock the door and go to our room.

802
00:55:38,945 --> 00:55:40,362
- [Ellen] I will.

803
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:45,938
- You know that everything
depends on this?

804
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:50,206
If you fail, it would mean
prison for both of us.

805
00:55:50,206 --> 00:55:51,578
- I won't fail.

806
00:55:51,578 --> 00:55:53,406
- You'll do whatever you have to do?

807
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:57,082
- Anything, I will do anything for you.

808
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:59,158
- Here's the key.

809
00:55:59,158 --> 00:56:01,408
Wait five minutes, then go.

810
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:07,364
Quietly.

811
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:15,201
(suspenseful music)

812
00:57:00,392 --> 00:57:02,392
(gasps)

813
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:07,182
- I thought, I thought
Robert was going to--

814
00:57:07,182 --> 00:57:08,015
- I see.

815
00:57:09,212 --> 00:57:12,315
Now I know why your husband
was so talkative this evening.

816
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:14,198
It was all a plot.

817
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:15,218
I always knew there was something

818
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:17,941
wrong about the two of you.

819
00:57:17,941 --> 00:57:21,884
Well my dear, now you're
both going to prison.

820
00:57:21,884 --> 00:57:24,698
You and your dear husband.

821
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:26,042
- No it was my idea,

822
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,915
Robert doesn't know anything about this.

823
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:31,224
- You gave him away yourself.

824
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:33,354
Robert was going to, what?

825
00:57:33,354 --> 00:57:34,437
Keep me busy?

826
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:41,685
You will send him to
jail with your own words.

827
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:44,859
- No please, I'll do anything.

828
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:46,762
- I'm gonna telephone the police.

829
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:49,762
(suspenseful music)

830
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:58,266
(screaming)

831
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:03,741
(gasping and scuffling)

832
00:58:20,737 --> 00:58:21,737
- I'm sorry.

833
00:58:24,994 --> 00:58:26,634
Oh my God.

834
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:27,467
Oh my God.

835
00:58:28,935 --> 00:58:31,768
(sobbing breaths)

836
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:54,479
- Don't worry dear.

837
00:58:54,479 --> 00:58:56,844
(screaming)

838
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:59,184
That part of it's over now.

839
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:02,773
You posed a slightly different
problem from the others.

840
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,773
All you wanted was love,

841
00:59:06,438 --> 00:59:09,574
but I always honor my end of the bargain,

842
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:12,407
and of course I couldn't love you.

843
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:16,273
So in order to get what I wanted,

844
00:59:16,273 --> 00:59:20,106
we had to resolve our
relationship, like this.

845
00:59:27,204 --> 00:59:29,293
- [Mrs. Albright] You see Mrs. Delaney,

846
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:32,523
there are some things one shouldn't do.

847
00:59:32,523 --> 00:59:34,583
Not even for love.

848
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,159
- I don't understand.

849
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:39,327
- But you will my dear.

850
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:40,160
You will.

851
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,042
Come along.

852
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:44,133
Come, come now.

853
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:48,312
Give me your hand.

854
00:59:48,312 --> 00:59:49,145
You must.

855
00:59:50,492 --> 00:59:53,147
You see, you're mine now.

856
00:59:53,147 --> 00:59:56,147
(suspenseful music)

857
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:30,389
(knocking)

858
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,155
- Kathryn.

859
01:00:39,155 --> 01:00:40,626
Are you all right?

860
01:00:40,626 --> 01:00:42,459
- I was, I was asleep.

861
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:47,133
- Kathryn listen to me,
we're alone in the house.

862
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:49,446
- What's that sir, what did you say?

863
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,121
- Mrs. Grove is gone.

864
01:00:51,121 --> 01:00:53,088
Her floor is covered with blood.

865
01:00:53,088 --> 01:00:57,098
No one's in Will's room or the
Delaney's or Miss Lester's.

866
01:00:57,098 --> 01:00:59,181
We're the only ones left.

867
01:01:00,379 --> 01:01:01,212
- Left?

868
01:01:01,212 --> 01:01:02,792
What do you mean?

869
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,264
You said there's blood
in Aunt Mary's room?

870
01:01:05,264 --> 01:01:07,181
- And in Miss Lester's.

871
01:01:09,277 --> 01:01:11,871
- What about the new one?

872
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,496
- I didn't try her room.

873
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:15,446
Get dressed.

874
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:16,497
Quickly.

875
01:01:16,497 --> 01:01:18,580
We're leaving this house.

876
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,423
Now!

877
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:39,296
Quickly now!

878
01:01:54,674 --> 01:01:56,007
Cover your eyes.

879
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:15,037
- What is it?

880
01:02:15,037 --> 01:02:16,620
Why won't it break?

881
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:21,520
- Kathryn.

882
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:25,118
This is the work of the Devil,

883
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:29,839
and I believe the Devil
is in this house tonight,

884
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,256
or some servant of the Devil.

885
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:35,285
- You mean Mrs. Albright?

886
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:36,118
- Yes?

887
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:45,295
No no, Kathryn dear our
kind invented the cross.

888
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,259
- Where are the others?

889
01:02:50,259 --> 01:02:51,092
- With me.

890
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:56,070
It's a bit of a disappointment
really how easy it was.

891
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,548
- Why have you come here?

892
01:02:57,548 --> 01:02:59,127
Why choose us?

893
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:01,468
- It's a kind of a test really.

894
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:02,394
For me.

895
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:04,127
Not for you.

896
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:06,371
My master sets me a challenge.

897
01:03:06,371 --> 01:03:10,334
Can I win the souls of
everyone in a house?

898
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:12,590
- But you haven't won ours yet.

899
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,757
- No, not yet.

900
01:03:15,778 --> 01:03:20,084
Of course almost always
somebody catches on,

901
01:03:20,084 --> 01:03:22,866
and that usually makes it more difficult.

902
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:25,273
I knew from the first moment I saw you

903
01:03:25,273 --> 01:03:27,606
that you would be a problem,

904
01:03:28,573 --> 01:03:31,156
but we will do the best we can.

905
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:36,030
(ominous music)

906
01:03:40,072 --> 01:03:41,943
- Still pretending to limp?

907
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,508
Why bother, we know what you are.

908
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:46,675
- Oh no, the limp is real.

909
01:03:47,841 --> 01:03:49,563
An old war wound.

910
01:03:49,563 --> 01:03:50,693
- War wound?

911
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:51,526
What war?

912
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,564
- Why our war of course.

913
01:04:00,638 --> 01:04:01,618
- [Kathryn] Oh God!

914
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:03,201
- Kathryn, Kathryn!

915
01:04:12,878 --> 01:04:14,697
Stop it, stop it!

916
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:15,761
Kathryn stop it!

917
01:04:15,761 --> 01:04:17,641
- Jesus she's going to kill us!

918
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:20,170
- No, no, that isn't what she wants.

919
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:22,079
Please Kathryn you must listen!

920
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,476
She wants something far more
valuable than our lives.

921
01:04:25,476 --> 01:04:28,332
She wants our souls do you understand?

922
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,165
- Our souls?

923
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:29,998
- Yes.

924
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:33,139
To be with her forever in Hell.

925
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:33,993
- No!

926
01:04:33,993 --> 01:04:35,243
- Listen to me!

927
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:39,480
She can not take our souls
unless we surrender them.

928
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,063
We must resist her.

929
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:44,549
Kathryn, do you fear the Devil?

930
01:04:46,265 --> 01:04:47,674
- I don't know!

931
01:04:47,674 --> 01:04:48,915
- Well you must know!

932
01:04:48,915 --> 01:04:50,628
What use is your life if you buy it

933
01:04:50,628 --> 01:04:52,554
with an eternity in Hell?

934
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:56,721
- I'm sorry sir, I'm sorry I
just don't know, I don't know!

935
01:04:57,916 --> 01:04:59,416
I don't wanna die.

936
01:05:01,635 --> 01:05:05,052
(book clatters on floor)

937
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:09,678
(whimpering)

938
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:16,730
(yells in surprise)

939
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,721
What is it?

940
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:19,078
- I don't know.

941
01:05:19,078 --> 01:05:20,745
One of her servants.

942
01:05:21,648 --> 01:05:24,528
(screaming)

943
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:26,111
There, there it is!

944
01:05:27,578 --> 01:05:31,745
(dramatic music)
(whimpering)

945
01:05:38,927 --> 01:05:41,260
(screaming)

946
01:05:43,945 --> 01:05:45,448
- It's still alive!

947
01:05:45,448 --> 01:05:47,781
(screaming)

948
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,782
(glass shatters)

949
01:05:55,782 --> 01:05:59,532
- You're gonna have to
pay for that Mr. Gray.

950
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:09,507
(sobbing and whimpering)

951
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:19,767
In number five, in Hell alive,

952
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:23,177
thy souls forever in my hands.

953
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:27,132
So go and do as I command.

954
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:31,646
(suspenseful music)

955
01:06:49,908 --> 01:06:52,241
(screaming)

956
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:01,011
- Kathryn, candles.

957
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,024
We need candles.

958
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,644
- That drawer.

959
01:07:05,644 --> 01:07:06,477
- Ow!

960
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:13,877
(whimpering)
(suspenseful music)

961
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:18,804
Whatever happens remember,

962
01:07:18,804 --> 01:07:23,443
God doesn't ask anything
of us that we can't do.

963
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:24,776
- It's too late.

964
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:26,540
Too late.

965
01:07:29,009 --> 01:07:31,807
(screaming)

966
01:07:31,807 --> 01:07:35,974
(stabbing)
(yelling in pain)

967
01:07:42,004 --> 01:07:44,171
(hissing)

968
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,278
- This way Kathryn.

969
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,278
(suspenseful music)

970
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:02,075
(screaming and laughter)

971
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,867
(yells in pain)

972
01:08:16,874 --> 01:08:19,707
(stairs creaking)

973
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,250
- Well surely you didn't expect

974
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,583
something civilized from me did you Sam?

975
01:08:38,617 --> 01:08:40,978
- The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want.

976
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:43,600
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

977
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,980
- See that I'm the one who's
making you lie down now.

978
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,353
- He restoreth my soul--

979
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:52,869
- Oh yes yes yes, but what
about the girl's soul?

980
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:54,102
- The girl?

981
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:55,075
(laughter)

982
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:57,412
- That got your attention didn't it?

983
01:08:57,412 --> 01:08:58,995
Better take a look.

984
01:09:05,832 --> 01:09:09,832
She's in need of some of
your spiritual comfort.

985
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,973
(crying)

986
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,744
- God please help me!

987
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:29,698
- Don't look away!

988
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,934
If everything works out the way you hope,

989
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,078
we'll have a martyr here.

990
01:09:34,078 --> 01:09:35,514
- She's innocent!

991
01:09:35,514 --> 01:09:37,355
She doesn't deserve this!

992
01:09:37,355 --> 01:09:39,551
- God please make it stop!

993
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,383
Make it stop!

994
01:09:41,383 --> 01:09:42,741
(screaming)

995
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:45,163
God please make it stop!

996
01:09:45,163 --> 01:09:47,496
(screaming)

997
01:09:50,509 --> 01:09:52,558
- What will you give me?

998
01:09:52,558 --> 01:09:54,078
- Don't answer her!

999
01:09:54,078 --> 01:09:55,811
Don't answer her!

1000
01:09:55,811 --> 01:09:59,061
- Now Sam, let's be realistic shall we?

1001
01:10:01,306 --> 01:10:04,042
Kathryn's a nice dull sort of girl,

1002
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:07,628
but we both know she isn't
cut from the martyr cloth.

1003
01:10:07,628 --> 01:10:09,403
Maybe you'll be able to endure

1004
01:10:09,403 --> 01:10:13,570
but as for Kathryn, I'd give
her another 10 or 15 minutes.

1005
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,896
- Oh God make it stop!

1006
01:10:19,141 --> 01:10:22,118
- My dear, if you want little Miss Lester

1007
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:26,757
to stop her games you'll
have to ask someone closer.

1008
01:10:26,757 --> 01:10:28,674
- Please make her stop.

1009
01:10:30,263 --> 01:10:32,096
- What'll you give me?

1010
01:10:32,988 --> 01:10:35,609
- Anything, anything please!

1011
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:36,442
- Done.

1012
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:37,275
- No!

1013
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:52,043
- Hmm, not even five minutes.

1014
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:54,945
(clucks tongue)

1015
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:56,631
Is the human soul growing weaker

1016
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:59,097
or is it that people simply
can't stand suffering

1017
01:10:59,097 --> 01:11:00,847
the way they used to?

1018
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,001
Come my dear.

1019
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:05,663
You've made a fool's bargain,

1020
01:11:05,663 --> 01:11:08,346
but then fools often do don't they?

1021
01:11:08,346 --> 01:11:09,179
- Wait.

1022
01:11:10,151 --> 01:11:12,296
I'll make a trade.

1023
01:11:12,296 --> 01:11:13,713
My soul for hers.

1024
01:11:15,642 --> 01:11:16,642
- Oh really?

1025
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:20,321
Well you certainly think
highly of yourself.

1026
01:11:20,321 --> 01:11:22,071
- Don't play with me!

1027
01:11:23,021 --> 01:11:25,021
You'll make the bargain.

1028
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:30,263
- No, that would be too
generous on my part.

1029
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:36,255
If I let her go who knows
what she may do with her life.

1030
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:40,066
She might become a notorious sinner.

1031
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:42,068
Would you expect us to deprive ourselves

1032
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:44,858
of the pleasure of her
company in that event?

1033
01:11:44,858 --> 01:11:46,191
No, it won't do.

1034
01:11:48,966 --> 01:11:51,519
Can we limit the bargain?

1035
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,436
Be a bit more specific?

1036
01:11:54,622 --> 01:11:57,539
- You release her, no more torture.

1037
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:01,417
You don't visit her again.

1038
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,667
Offer her no more bargains.

1039
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:08,159
She leaves alive unbound by you.

1040
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:12,116
Her soul her own.

1041
01:12:14,277 --> 01:12:18,444
Whatever evil she may do after
that, that is on her soul.

1042
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:23,225
- No more torture.

1043
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:25,757
I refrain from killing her.

1044
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:29,097
I erase the bargain we just made.

1045
01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:31,802
She's free to go where she wishes,

1046
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:35,232
and I offer her no new bargains.

1047
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:38,339
In return, you give me your soul

1048
01:12:38,339 --> 01:12:42,172
to be lost in my master's
shadow for all time.

1049
01:12:44,715 --> 01:12:46,244
- Yes.

1050
01:12:46,244 --> 01:12:47,077
- Done!

1051
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,883
I knew your weakness all along.

1052
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:58,429
- What weakness?

1053
01:12:58,429 --> 01:12:59,895
- Hubris.

1054
01:12:59,895 --> 01:13:03,162
You thought you could
redeem the soul of another.

1055
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:06,862
Do you really imagine
yourself to be the redeemer?

1056
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:10,112
Girl the door's open go where you will.

1057
01:13:24,415 --> 01:13:26,498
- Go on, don't look back.

1058
01:13:28,944 --> 01:13:31,611
(ominous music)

1059
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:41,004
- Have you finished the book my dear?

1060
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:42,169
- Yes.

1061
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:43,372
It told me what to do.

1062
01:13:43,372 --> 01:13:45,671
It told me everything.

1063
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,866
It was just like the book said.

1064
01:13:47,866 --> 01:13:51,616
It didn't hurt at all,
but I pretended it did.

1065
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:54,381
- You were simply marvelous.

1066
01:13:54,381 --> 01:13:55,214
- Kathryn?

1067
01:13:56,905 --> 01:13:59,655
- Yes, I always keep my promises.

1068
01:14:01,022 --> 01:14:02,803
She's free to go where she wishes,

1069
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:06,386
but she had already
chosen to come with me,

1070
01:14:08,228 --> 01:14:10,482
and I need make no new bargains

1071
01:14:10,482 --> 01:14:13,815
because our bargain had already been made.

1072
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:15,398
- It's all in here.

1073
01:14:16,469 --> 01:14:19,429
All about the Earth King, and
how he'll make you powerful

1074
01:14:19,429 --> 01:14:22,148
so you can get back at your enemies.

1075
01:14:22,148 --> 01:14:24,159
- Am I your enemy?

1076
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,589
- A friend is someone who can help you.

1077
01:14:26,589 --> 01:14:27,785
You couldn't.

1078
01:14:27,785 --> 01:14:28,618
She could.

1079
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:33,787
- But let's be completely
fair about this now shall we?

1080
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:36,200
You can read now can't you Kathryn?

1081
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,172
- Yes.

1082
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:39,859
- And you have already
tasted my knowledge.

1083
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:41,197
- Yes.

1084
01:14:41,197 --> 01:14:44,434
- Do you accept me of your own free will?

1085
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:45,267
- Kathryn!

1086
01:14:46,578 --> 01:14:48,197
- Yes.

1087
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:51,463
- Do you give yourself to
me of your own free will?

1088
01:14:51,463 --> 01:14:52,300
- [Kathryn] Yes.

1089
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,443
- Then the deal is done,
and I have kept my word.

1090
01:14:56,443 --> 01:14:59,443
(suspenseful music)

1091
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:03,468
- You fool.

1092
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:06,148
- You don't know nothing.

1093
01:15:06,148 --> 01:15:09,708
I'm going to be a queen
in Hell with silver robes.

1094
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:11,111
You'll see.

1095
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:14,944
I bet she'll make you
into one of those dolls.

1096
01:15:26,263 --> 01:15:30,180
- Amazing, it'll actually
be a surprise to her.

1097
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,937
But don't worry, I have a
special surprise for you as well.

1098
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:41,180
Come come, give me your arm.

1099
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,180
(suspenseful music)

1100
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:11,914
(whimpering and screaming)

1101
01:16:20,428 --> 01:16:21,261
Oh.

1102
01:16:28,955 --> 01:16:30,778
Gray imp wake.

1103
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:31,945
Gray imp wake.

1104
01:16:32,945 --> 01:16:36,445
There is work to do for thy master's sake.

1105
01:16:40,777 --> 01:16:44,944
(whimpering)
(ominous music)

1106
01:17:35,593 --> 01:17:38,093
I love the quiet of the night.

1107
01:17:39,178 --> 01:17:43,417
The Earth will be a
very nice place really.

1108
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:45,000
When all is silent.

1109
01:17:49,818 --> 01:17:53,985
(ominous music)
(dogs barking)

1110
01:18:02,338 --> 01:18:05,005
(ominous music)

1111
01:21:06,693 --> 01:21:09,526
(MultiCom Jingle)
