sufficient energy during the day.

28
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,670

Because Low Shoulder are playing
at Melody Lane.

72

They're this indie rock band from the city,

73
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:22,886
I saw their MySpace page...

74
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:25,848

00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,333

I'll pick you up at 8.30.

- Hi.

175
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:38,166
Hi. Um, I just wanted to meet you...

176
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,928
..or something?
I'm Jennifer Check.

177
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,090
And..this is my friend.

178
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,051
Hi.

179
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,374
I'm Nikolai, and this is...

180
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:46,895
..this is my band.

181
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:48,697
Low Shoulder.

182
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,659
Yeah, we heard..I heard of that band...

183
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,821
You play instruments really...

184
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,463
..super good.

185
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,185
Thank you, we're professionals.

186
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:58,826
Hey, sorry...

187
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,790
Can I ask you a question?

188
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,032
Why would you want to play all the way out
here in the Devil's Kettle?

189
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,273
You live in city, right?

190
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:06,676
Yeah. But, you know what...

191
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,798
I think it's really important sometimes to try
and connect with our fans in their...

192
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,960
..shitty areas too.

193
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,922
That's amazing.

194
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:19,608
Can I-Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure, what are we having?

195
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:22,572
They have this really awesome
9/11 tribute shooter?

196
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:24,614
It's red, white and blue,
but you have to drink it really fast...

197
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,936
..or it turns brownish.
- Alright, I'll drink it fast.

198
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,577
Okay.
- Okay.

199
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,459
I'll be right back.

200
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,860
Okay! How-how you're gonna get alcohol?

201
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:36,465
I'll just play hello titty with the bartender.

202
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,397
Dirk, what about her?

203
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:49,998
Who, Jan Brady?

204
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:51,520
No, man! Fuck you!

205
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,161
I'm talking about the one who just went
to get me a drink...

206
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:55,765
..butter-face princess.
That's the one.

207
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:58,328
I don't know! Seriously,
I grew up in a town like this, okay...

208
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,372
..there's always that girl, if they show it off,
they do not give it up.

209
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,013
You told us, you were from Brooklyn.

210
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:07,817
My point is, this girl's definitely a virgin.
Okay?

211
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,739
Now, I know girls like that...
- I don't know.

212
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:13,182
Well, you know, we didn't turn all the
way out here for nothing.

213
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:14,824
So...
- Excuse me.

214
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:16,306
Hey!
- Hey!

215
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:18,629
That's my best friend you're talking about.

216
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,591
And you're right, she is a virgin,

217
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:24,555
And not be sleeping with creeps like you.

218
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,969
The second one isn't full enough.

219
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,532
Those guys are rank, Jen.
Just forget about it.

220
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,974
You know what?
I think the lead singer likes me.

221
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,377
Only because he thinks you're a virgin.
I heard them talking.

222
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:47,096
What?

223
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:51,261
I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore,
thanks to Roman.

224
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,703
And by the way, that hurts.

225
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,746
I couldn't even go to flags the next day.

226
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:58,469
I had to stay home and sit on a
bag of frozen peas.

227
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,511
Oh, God!

228
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,436
Good evening, Devil's Lake.
- Devil's Kettle.

229
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:07,437
You're absolutely right at it.

230
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,840
<b>"Through the Trees"
performed by Low Shoulder</b>

231
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:28,459
<i>All alone in an empty room,</i>

232
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:33,223
<i>Nothing left but the memories of when...</i>

233
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,548
<i>..I had my best friend.</i>

234
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:39,109
<i>I don't know how we ended up here,</i>

235
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,914
<i>I don't know but it's never been so clear,</i>

236
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:48,199
<i>We made a mistake, dear.</i>

237
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,844
<i>And I see...</i>

238
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:56,327
<i>..the broken glass in front of me.</i>

239
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,850
<i>I see...</i>

240
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:03,013
<i>..your shadow hanging over me.</i>

241
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:07,018
<i>And your face, I can see...</i>

242
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,462
<i>Through the trees,</i>

243
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,986
<i>I will find you.</i>

244
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:21,113
<i>I will heal the ruins left inside you,</i>

245
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:24,797
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

246
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:27,919
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

247
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,723
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

248
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:34,967
<i>Until I'm set free.</i>

249
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:38,209
<i>Go quiet through the trees.</i>

250
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,656
<i>I remember how we used to talk,</i>

251
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,899
<i>About the places we would go when...</i>

252
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,621
<i>..we were off.</i>

253
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:51,343
<i>And all that we were gonna find.</i>

254
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:57,750
<i>And I remember our seeds grow,</i>

255
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,432
<i>And how you cried when you saw...</i>

256
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,595
<i>..the first leaves show.</i>

257
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,296
Hey, get out of there.

258
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,618
I know where to go.

259
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,364
It's okay, okay, Jen.

260
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,854
Jennifer?
- Oh, thank God, you guys are alright.

261
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,016
I have been looking everwhere for you two.

262
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,379
This sucks!
It's too dangerous out here.

263
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,541
You want to head somewhere safer,
like my van?

264
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:10,262
What?

265
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:13,707
I'm in survival mode, right now.
I want us to get to a familiar place...

266
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:15,869
..and right now, I feel like that's my van.

267
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,991
Okay...

268
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:19,032
Okay, this will help with the shock.
Great.

269
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,594
Are you shocked?
Have some of that.

270
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,237
No.

271
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,239
Jennifer?

272
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,123
Hey!

273
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,567
Let's go, Jennifer.

274
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,930
Let's go to the van.
- I want to go to your really cool van.

275
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,132
Needy, let's go see his van.
- Why? Why should we?

276
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,175
We have the Sebring,
let's just get out of here, please.

277
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,817
Needy, just stop it.

278
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,859
Just shut up!

279
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:04,238
<i>I watched her get into that van and I knew
something awful was going to happen.</i>

280
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,360
<i>He was skinny and twisted
and evil...</i>

281
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,005
<i>..like this petrified tree I saw
when I was kid.</i>

282
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,301
Hey, Niedermeyer.
- Thank God, you're there.

283
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,502
What wrong?
- Jennifer's gone.

284
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:12,067
She ran off with that rock band.
And Melody Lane burned down.

285
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:14,310
You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,272
There was this huge stampede and...

287
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:19,434
All the people who fainted got run over.

288
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:22,757
And you could hear their bones breaking.

289
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:24,440
And the people...

290
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,084
Like..the people on fire just smelled like...

291
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:31,046
This is crazy.
- But Jennifer's still with those creeps.

292
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,410
They took her in their spooky van with
the windows all blacked out.

293
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,733
Did you get the make and model?
- I don't know, Chip. An '89 Rapist.

294
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:40,055
She's still in there.
We have to go find her.

295
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,097
Who cares about Jennifer and
those douchebags...

296
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,779
..with their douchebag haircuts and
their manskirts.

297
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,821
People just burned to death.

298
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:49,266
Oh, cheese and fries!
There's somebody here.

299
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,628
I'm alone and I'm freaked out.
- Where's your mom?

300
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,268
Swing shift.

301
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,995
Stay on the phone with me, okay?

302
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:05,520
Needy, you want me to come over?
- I don't know.

303
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,443
Maybe.

304
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:19,897
Needy?

305
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,664
Chip, there's no one here.

306
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,907
So strange.

307
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,430
Maybe I'm going crazy.

308
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,594
Probably nothing.

309
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:40,196
Look, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

310
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:57,194
Hi.

311
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,327
What happened?

312
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,894
Jen?

313
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:20,258
Jen?

314
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,687
My mom got that at Boston market and...

315
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,529
Um, it's on your lips...

316
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:23,802
Jennifer...

317
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:25,844
Jennifer?

318
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:53,632
Are you scared?

319
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,212
Jennifer!

320
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,188
There's a body in here.

321
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,717
I heard Needy and Jennifer were there.

322
00:24:37,837 --> 00:24:40,681
And they had to fight their way out
with a machete.

323
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,842
Look, she's not even mØving.

324
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:45,406
It's called post-traumatic stress disorder.

325
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:48,249
My Dad was in operation during freedom...

326
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,892
..and he totally like, stopped talking,
like months.

327
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,259
I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie,
and you be her.

328
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,103
Why I should be ugly Ashley?

329
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:04,786
What wrong, Jennifer?

330
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:15,395
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me get a shot.

331
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,437
I never tell on you.

332
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:22,523
Where's it at, Monistat?

333
00:25:24,646 --> 00:25:27,487
You're alright.
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

334
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:31,652
I saw last night in my house...
- You do have a tendency to overeact.

335
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,374
You remember, when we were
in Girl Scout camp...

336
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:35,056
..and you totally thought there was
an earthquake...

337
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,898
..but it was just two guys with
a ghetto blaster?

338
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,144
People died, Jennifer.
It's like all over the news.

339
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:45,386
National news.

340
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:47,909
Anybody that we know?

341
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,231
We know everyone!

342
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,314
Sucks to be them, I guess.

343
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:58,680
What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

344
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,643
Besides the obvious surface flaws.

345
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,246
<i>I knew it was real.</i>

346
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:09,851
<i>I'd been up all night scrubbing the

Needy behaviors...

..dark day for Devil's Kettle.

Spanish teacher,

Kind of weird.

Well, It was Jennifer!

374
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:14,336
I mean, she looked like, she'd been
beaten up or shot or something.

375
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:17,982
And then she barfed up this like disgusting...

376

- Yuck.

378
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:27,912
She'd probably just inhaled a whole bunch
of smoke or something.

379
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:30,195
No, Chip! No, it was like...

380
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:31,955
It was like evil!

381

talk to the school shrink.

It's just...

..everybody's a little messed up about this.
And it's okay to feel...

386

Discombobulated?
- Yeah! Fucked up!

He's a really good writer.

397
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:16,561
He's like all dark and emotional

520
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,851
What you talking about, Needy?
- A fiery death trap last night,

521
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:02,494
And now a cannibal psycho takes down
the biggest guy in school, come on.

522
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:04,496
It's freaktarded.

523
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:08,060
Well, the bad luck's gotta be over, right?

524
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,063
I mean, it can't get any worse, right?
It can't.

525
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:12,825
I mean, you agree, right?

526
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:14,827
You're shaking.

527
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:16,109
I'm cold.

528
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:19,352
It's very cold out here.
- You want my hoodie?

531

The days marched on as usual,

532
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:29,843
..but most of us were too numb
to enjoy ourselves.

533
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:31,684
Most of us.

534
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:35,008
<i>I don't know how we ended up here.</i>

535
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,493
<i>I don't know but it's never been so clear.</i>

536
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:43,736
<i>We made a mistake, dear.</i>

537
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:47,740
<i>To the rest of the world we were famous.
We were saints.</i>

538
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,902
<i>Our town's only bar had burned to the ground.</i>

539
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:53,147
<i>And our star line-backer was
someone's snack pack.</i>

540
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:56,910
<i>The whole country got a huge tragedy boner
for Devil's Kettle.</i>

541
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,352

542
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:01,435

00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:09,483
<i>I will find you.</i>

545
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:16,571
<i>I will heal the ruins left inside you.</i>

546
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,253

547
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:23,376

00:39:30,544 --> 00:39:33,667
<i>Go quiet through the trees.</i>

551
00:39:33,947 --> 00:39:35,990
<i>Still, we were healing.</i>

552
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:39,513
<i>Like Chip, we figured things could
only get better.</i>

553
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,156
<i>We had faith.</i>

554
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:45,119
<i>We were fucking idiots.</i>

555
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,244
Before the period ends, I would like to
make an announcement.

556
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:54,288
As you all know, today is the
one month anniversary of...

557
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,530
..the tragedy at Melody Lane,

558
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,173
..and the murder of Jonas Kozelle.

559
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:01,134
Boring.

560
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:04,297
As I was saying, Jennifer...

561
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:05,538
..and Needy.

562
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,062
I finally got some good news to
share with all of you.

563
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:11,025
The members of the rock n' roll group
Low Shoulder,

564
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:14,949
..have decided to extend a helping hand
to our community.

565
00:40:15,188 --> 00:40:17,071
As you all know, their song...

566
00:40:17,191 --> 00:40:18,593
'Through the trees'

567
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:23,518
..has become our unofficial anthem
of unity and healing.

568
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:26,800
And they have decided to release it
as a benefit single.

569
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:31,246
3% of the profits will go to local families
who have been affected by loss.

570
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:34,008
What about the other 97%?

571
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:36,850
I mean, that's just crass. Right?

572
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,534
Crass.

573
00:40:39,614 --> 00:40:42,578
It means greedy. Exploitative.
Scummy.

574
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:45,700
Low Shoulder are American heroes.
- No, they're not.

575
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,702
I was there, Chastity.

576
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:50,345
They didn't helped anybody escape the fire.

577
00:40:50,425 --> 00:40:52,146
I don't even know how that
rumor all got started.

578
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:53,467
Rumor?

579
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:54,469
Rumor?

580
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:55,990
It's true!

581
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:57,913
It's on the Wikipedia.

582
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:02,037
We wouldn't even know who they were
if they hadn't been playing that night.

583
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:04,680
They used by us.
- You take that back, Needy Lesnicki!

584
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,400
Girls?

585
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,082
We need them now more than ever.

586
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:08,684
That's enough.

587
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:16,452
I'm already sick of that song.
- Yeah, it's really poorly produced.

588
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:19,735
Could the bass be any lower in the mix?
- No offense,

589
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:21,817
..but you really look tired.

590
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,860
Is everything, okay?
- No.

591
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,542
I feel like boo-bbo.

592
00:41:25,662 --> 00:41:30,305
My skin is breaking out and
my hair is dull and lifeless.

593
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:31,346
Oh, God.

594
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,828
It's like I'm one of the normal girls!

595
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:35,991
Are you PMS-ing or something?

596
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:37,392
PMS isn't real, Needy.

597
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:40,637
It was invented by the boy-run media
to make us seem crazy.

598
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:44,760
Don't look at me like that.

599
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:49,525
It's just wearing off or something.
- What's wearing off?

600
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,170
Hello, Needy.

601
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,010
Hi.

602
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,371
Jennifer.

603
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,534
Hey, Collin.

604
00:41:57,854 --> 00:41:59,656
Can I borrow your English homework again?

605
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:01,177
I forgot to read Hamlet.

606
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,219
Is he gonna fuck his mom?

607
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:07,182
I don't..I don't...
I don't think so.

608
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:09,586
I sort of wanted to ask you something.

609
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:11,908
You want to know if I'll go out with you?
- No.

610
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,110
Yeah! What?

611
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:18,154
How-How did you know?
- Just go ahead with the pitch.

612
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:21,638
Okay.

613
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,162
Well, we have been having a lot fun
in the class, you and I,

614
00:42:26,202 --> 00:42:28,244
..and I thought maybe you would like to go,
see a movie...

615
00:42:28,364 --> 00:42:29,885
..or something.

616
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:34,491
There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror
at the Bijou, next weekend.

617
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:36,973
I don't like boxing movies.

618
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,456
Yeah, but..
It's not a...

619
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:43,460
Fucking boxing movie.

620
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,342
Fuck it, okay.
Forget it.

621
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:49,626
That was random.

622
00:42:49,746 --> 00:42:52,189
I'm used to boys asking me out, Needy.

623
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:55,192
Collin's really nice.

624
00:42:55,712 --> 00:42:58,155
He's into maggot-rock.
He wears nail polish.

625
00:42:58,234 --> 00:43:01,358
My dick is bigger than his.
- Well, I think he is really cool.

626
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,961
You do?
- Yeah.

627
00:43:06,203 --> 00:43:08,124
Wait! Collin?

628
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,409
Why don't you just come by
my place tonight?

629
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,534
I just got Aquamarine on DVD.
It's about this girl who like, half-sushi.

630
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:19,376
I guess she has sex through her blowhole
or something.

631
00:43:21,418 --> 00:43:22,940
Okay.

632
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:25,823
Great! Yeah.

633
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,626
Okay, I'll text you my address.

634
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:30,988
Cool.

635
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,033
Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,718
Hi, Chip.

637
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,762
Get a room.

638
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,646
So talking to your mysterious pal
Collin Gray, again?

639
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,487
No.

640
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:53,091
He was asking Jennifer out on a date.
- That's weird.

641
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:55,453
So, you're gonna come over tonight?

642
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,094
Sure. I'd like that.

643
00:43:57,173 --> 00:44:00,018
I went to Super Target and
picked up more condoms. So,

644
00:44:00,218 --> 00:44:02,140
Thanks.
- Not that that has anything to do with...

645
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,581
Oh, no. I didn't assume that.

646
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:04,902
Well, I'm...

647
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:07,706
Okay, I'll see you tonight then.

648
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:10,108

if you..?

652
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:26,765

00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:56,959
<i>I wanna love you, love you,
you already know.</i>

691
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:03,126
You made it.

692
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,531
What's going on?

693
00:49:14,137 --> 00:49:16,058
This...

694
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,821
This isn't really your house, is it?

695
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:22,145
No, baby.

696
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,986
This is our house.

697
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:25,988
Just for you and me.

698
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,311
We can play Mommy and Daddy.

699
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,042
Do you even know my last name?

700
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:42,806
Silly.

701
00:49:43,287 --> 00:49:45,609
I've been sending you signals all year.

702
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:48,411
Couldn't you tell?

703
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:51,214
You give me such a wettie.

704
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:10,033
Put it in.

705
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:32,376
Jennifer!

706
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,938
What?

707
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:36,019
Are you scared?

708
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,343
I mean, I thought boys like yØu were
really into..vermin.

709
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:40,986
Death and shit.

710
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:43,707
Here you go.

711
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,431
Nice hardware, ace.

712
00:51:12,817 --> 00:51:14,739
No way...

713
00:51:20,824 --> 00:51:22,065
Shit!

714
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:22,987
Oh, puncture wound!

715
00:51:23,068 --> 00:51:25,910
God, that's so emo.

716
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:31,997
I need you frightened.

717
00:52:03,108 --> 00:52:05,550
I need you hopeless.

718
00:52:10,437 --> 00:52:12,078
Hopeless!

719
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,259
What?

720
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:37,262
What?

721
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,745
Am I hurting you?

722
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,190
Am I too big?

723
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:49,996
What?

724
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:55,481
Needy! What's wrong?

725
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:57,964
Is it something I did?

726
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:43,830
Mommy! Mommy?

727
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:11,539
Are you scared?

728
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,298
Hi.

729
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,582
Hi, Needy!
Enough with this screaming.

730
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:54,743
You're such a cliche.
- Get out!

731
00:55:56,384 --> 00:55:59,626
But we always share your bed when
we have slumber parties.

732
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,677
I'm not gonna bite you.

733
00:56:15,884 --> 00:56:18,206
How may you own that T-shirt?

734
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:25,314
What the fuck is happening?
- My God, Needy!

735
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:28,078
I have never heard you drop
the F-bomb before.

736
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:31,361
You! I saw you! I saw you!
- Buh-buh-buh.

737
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:34,164
Slow down, tardy slip.
You sound like a sped.

738
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:35,885
I'm gonna call the police.

739
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:38,408
Oh, okay! Why don't you narc me out.

740
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:41,091
I've the cops in my back pocket, Needy.

741
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,654
I'm fucking a cadet, remember?

742
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:46,097
What you want from me?

743
00:57:46,176 --> 00:57:48,858
Just only explain some things to you.

744
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:53,143
Besides, best friends don't keep secrets.
Right?

745
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:57,068
Incase, you remember the night of the fire?

746
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:59,070
I got really messed up.

747
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:01,072
And those guys from Low Shoulder.

748
00:58:01,072 --> 00:58:02,594
Totally evil.

749
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:07,357
They are basically like agents of Satan
with really awesome haircuts.

750
00:58:09,439 --> 00:58:11,361
<b>"Finishing School"
performed by Dashboard Confessional</b>

751
00:58:15,846 --> 00:58:17,488
Where-Where are we going?

752
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:19,891
You don't have to talk,
if you don't want it.

753
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,861
Are you guys rapists?

754
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:33,504
Oh, God! I hate girls.

755
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,912
Are you even sure she's
fucking virgin, man?

756
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:43,834
Yes!
Yes, I'm a virgin!

757
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:47,438
I'm virign! I never-never even done sex.
I don't know how.

758
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,443
So..you guys find somebody who does.

759
00:58:51,802 --> 00:58:53,124
Know how.

760
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:53,925
See, Dirk?

761
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:56,086
I told you, man.
You owe me a beer.

762
00:58:56,688 --> 00:58:57,810
What did they do to you?

763
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,531
Just let me finish.

764
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:01,493
So they drove me out to the falls.

765
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,816
And I kept looking for a way to escape but...

766
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:07,258
..it's really dark out there.

767
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:17,348
Where are you going, huh?

768
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,951
We got a waxing moon tonight, you guys.

769
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:22,074
Just like the ritual said.

770
00:59:32,926 --> 00:59:36,048
Why don't you guys have something to
shut up her up with?

771
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:41,012
Dirk, get a knife and tie it well.

772
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:42,734
Because I don't want it to get uncord.

773
00:59:52,864 --> 00:59:54,788
I don't know if we should go
through with this.

774
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:57,949
Dirk.

775
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:01,073
You wanna work in musical copy forever?
I don't.

776
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:02,034
Okay?

777
01:00:02,114 --> 01:00:04,196
You wanna be a big loser or...

778
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:06,199
..do you wanna be rich...

779
01:00:06,279 --> 01:00:09,522
..and awesome like that guy from Maroon 5?

780
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:13,206
Maroon 5.

781
01:00:13,926 --> 01:00:15,447
Okay, so I thought.

782
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,450
Go and fetch me the ritual, brother.

783
01:00:25,097 --> 01:00:26,620
Thank you.

784
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:28,582
Alright.

785
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:31,904
That's it?
- Yeah, I found it online.

786
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:36,988
We come here tonight to
sacrifice the body of...

787
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:40,994
What's your name again?
Tiffany?

788
01:00:41,114 --> 01:00:42,915
My name is Jennifer.

789
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:43,797
Super.

790
01:00:43,877 --> 01:00:44,878
We come here tonight...

791
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:47,880
..to sacrifice the body of Jennifer
from Devil's Kettle.

792
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,482
Please, please...

793
01:00:49,763 --> 01:00:53,687
Please let me go. I'll do anything.
I'll do any fucking...

794
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,416
Do you know how hard it is to make it
as an indie band these days?

795
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:05,018
There's so many of us,

796
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:09,102
We're all so cute and it's like if you don't
get on Letterman..

797
01:01:09,262 --> 01:01:12,786
..or some retarded soundtrack,
you're screwed, okay?

798
01:01:12,946 --> 01:01:14,588
Satan is our only chance.

799
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:16,310
We're in league with the beast now.

800
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,471
And we have to make a really
big impression on it.

801
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:21,275
And to do that, we're going to
have to butcher you.

802
01:01:21,435 --> 01:01:22,556
And bleed you.

803
01:01:22,837 --> 01:01:24,358
And Dirk here is gonna wear your face.

804
01:01:24,438 --> 01:01:26,240
Relax, I'm kidding about the face.

805
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,282
The rest is gonna happen though.

806
01:01:31,405 --> 01:01:32,927
You know what?
May be we'll write a song about you.

807
01:01:33,006 --> 01:01:35,329
I think as a fan that would be
pretty cool, right?

808
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:46,060
With the deepest malice,

809
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:49,143
We deliver this virgin unto thee.

810
01:01:49,223 --> 01:01:50,744
Dude, that is a hot murder weapon.

811
01:01:50,904 --> 01:01:52,145
It's a bowie knife.

812
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:53,346
Bowie? Nice.

813
01:01:53,427 --> 01:01:55,350
Alright, here we go!
It's gonna be alright.

814
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:58,073
Help me please..please..
Help me...

815
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:00,194
Wait a sec!
I just thought of something.

816
01:02:00,595 --> 01:02:02,116
Jen.

817
01:02:02,396 --> 01:02:03,558
Jen, you're the girl for me.

818
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,840
You don't know me.
But you make me so happy.

819
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,763
I tried to call you before,
but I lost my nerve.

820
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:11,485
I used my imagination.

821
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,169
But I was disturbed.

822
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,652
Jenny, I got your number.

823
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:20,696
I need to make you mine.

824
01:02:20,896 --> 01:02:24,018
Jenny, dont change your number,

825
01:02:24,098 --> 01:02:27,141
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....

826
01:02:27,261 --> 01:02:30,105
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....

827
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:34,750
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....

828
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:44,038
They killed you.
- Oops!

829
01:02:44,238 --> 01:02:45,881
I'm still here, aren't I?

830
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:48,883
I mean, they did go Benihana
on my ass with that knife.

831
01:02:48,963 --> 01:02:50,766
And it should have killed me but...

832
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,728
..for some reason...

833
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,449
..it didn't.

834
01:02:56,411 --> 01:02:58,053
Maybe it did.

835
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,482
Anyway, I don't really remember
what happened after that.

836
01:03:26,562 --> 01:03:29,164
I just know that I woke up and...

837
01:03:29,365 --> 01:03:31,687
..I found my way back to you.

838
01:03:43,378 --> 01:03:45,020
I remember.

839
01:03:45,941 --> 01:03:48,144
I couldn't bring myself to hurt you.

840
01:03:48,344 --> 01:03:50,667
I mean, I'm a really good friend.

841
01:03:51,468 --> 01:03:54,190
I was just so hungry.

842
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,371
Ahmet!

843
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,453
You made it out?

844
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:23,060
Are you lost?

845
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,384
Does your host family know that
you're alive?

846
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:34,070
Does anyone know you're alive?

847
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:41,517
You come with me.

848
01:04:41,918 --> 01:04:43,561
We will sort this out.

849
01:04:45,401 --> 01:04:49,327
And ever since then, I just knew what
I have to do to be strong.

850
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:53,210
And when I'm full, like I'm right now.
I'm like...

851
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,052
..unkillable.

852
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,094
Like I can do shit like this.
Watch!

853
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,939
It's really cool.
Just relax. Look.

854
01:05:05,664 --> 01:05:07,705
It's like some X-Men shit, right?

855
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:17,035
What do you mean, when you're full?

856
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:22,439
What about my mom's Kia?

857
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,922
Why were you covered in blood?

858
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:27,365
You didn't even look human.

859
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:33,330
You know, Needy, maybe you should
talk to somebody about these...

860
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,452
..disturbing thoughts.

861
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:39,176
..that you're having.
We're all really concerned.

862
01:05:40,178 --> 01:05:42,099
Especially, Chip.

863
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,023
I think he may be having
second thoughts about you.

864
01:05:45,102 --> 01:05:46,064
Leave!

865
01:05:46,224 --> 01:05:48,425
Come on, Needy.
Let me stay the night.

866
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:51,789
We can play 'boyfriend/girlfriend'
like we used to.

867
01:06:06,205 --> 01:06:08,926
What are you doing?
- Um, you said to leave.

868
01:06:09,326 --> 01:06:11,250
See you at school.

869
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:39,878
We're gathered here to celebrate
the life of Collin Gray.

870
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:42,761
Who was plucked from the prime
of his youth.

871
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:57,576
<i>They did a big memorial assembly
for Collin at school.</i>

872
01:06:58,457 --> 01:07:00,660
<i>And we had to watch another
presentation about curfews...</i>

873
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:03,982
<i>..and the buddy system and
how to deal with grief.</i>

874
01:07:04,423 --> 01:07:06,746
<i>But nobody seemed to care anymore.</i>

875
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:09,868
<i>Sorrow was last week's emotion.</i>

876
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:14,714
<i>Sure we all hope this would be
the last funeral.</i>

877
01:07:15,033 --> 01:07:16,675
<i>But I knew better.</i>

878
01:07:17,317 --> 01:07:19,359
<i>So I did some research.</i>

879
01:07:19,879 --> 01:07:21,801
<i>Paranormal research.</i>

<b>OFFERING A VIRGIN TO SATAN.</b>

Destroying a demon.

883
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,348
Demons are weakest when hungry.

884
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:52,912
But a blade to the heart is the
surest way to kill the beast.

885

888
01:08:24,544 --> 01:08:26,467
I just bought our formal tickets.

889
01:08:26,546 --> 01:08:29,270
Did you make reservations at
the Cheesecake Factory?

890
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:32,993
Chip, I can't go to the dance
with you.

891
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:34,394
What? Why?

892
01:08:34,594 --> 01:08:36,117
Look, just trust me.

893
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:37,838
You shouldn't go at all.

894
01:08:37,957 --> 01:08:40,560
What're you talking about?
- Not here.

895
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,803
What's going on?
You're breaking up with me?

896
01:08:42,963 --> 01:08:44,884
Please, Chip.
I just need to tell you something.

897
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:46,207
Is this about Jennifer?
- Yes.

898
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,410
But I promise you this is the last time...
- Needy, I care about you.

899
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:50,331
A lot.

900
01:08:50,411 --> 01:08:53,814
As a person, not just some girl
I made love to four minutes ago.

901
01:08:53,893 --> 01:08:56,095
And-And I'm scared of what's
happening to you.

902
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:59,900
You're acting really fucked up.
- Please just let me show you.

903
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:03,904
Okay.

904
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:05,626
Jennifer's evil.

905
01:09:06,507 --> 01:09:07,749
I know.

906
01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:09,991
No, I mean, she's actually evil.

907
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:11,713
Not high school evil.

908
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:15,435
I've been through the occult section
of the library five times.

909
01:09:15,636 --> 01:09:17,557
Our library has a occult section?

910
01:09:17,677 --> 01:09:20,801
Yeah, its-its really small...

911
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,164
You have to read this.

912
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:26,848
Demon...
- Demonic transference.

913
01:09:26,928 --> 01:09:28,089
It's something that happens...

914
01:09:28,169 --> 01:09:30,211
..when you try to sacrifice
a virgin to Satan...

915
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,933
..without using an actual virgin.

916
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:33,134
The guys from the band...

917
01:09:33,214 --> 01:09:34,736
..tried to sacrifice her in the woods.

918
01:09:34,815 --> 01:09:35,656
But what they didn't know...

919
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:37,738
..is that she hasn't been a virgin
since junior high.

920
01:09:37,818 --> 01:09:39,340
It all makes sense now.
Read this.

921
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,183
If the human sacrifice is impure,

922
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:42,384
..the result may still be obtained.

923
01:09:42,464 --> 01:09:44,667
But a demon will ever reside in the
soul of the victim.

924
01:09:44,746 --> 01:09:47,749
She must forever feed on flesh
to substain the demon.

925
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,990
Okay.
- She's eating boys!

926
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,632
They like make her really...

927
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:52,834
..pretty and glowy...

928
01:09:52,913 --> 01:09:54,836
..and her hair looks amazing.

929
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,959
And then when she's hungry,
she's weak and cranky and ugly.

930
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,961
I mean like ugly for her.

931
01:10:00,521 --> 01:10:02,163
So, you get it?

932
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:03,566
The dance.

933
01:10:03,886 --> 01:10:07,009
It'll be like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

934
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:11,573
Needy, I think you need help.

935
01:10:11,693 --> 01:10:13,495
Oh, my God!
You don't beleive me.

936
01:10:13,575 --> 01:10:16,698
It's not that I don't believe you,
I just don't believe this.

937
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,221
God, this is a nightmare.

938
01:10:21,783 --> 01:10:23,425
And what about the dance?

939
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:26,788
Who cares about the goddamn dance, Chip?
- I do.

940
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:29,190
I ordered your corsage,
it's an orchid.

941
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:31,233
It was like $12.

942
01:10:34,395 --> 01:10:35,636
I'll be at the dance.

943
01:10:35,717 --> 01:10:37,640
I just need to keep an eye on Jennifer.

944
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:40,562
Promise me, you're not gonna go.

945
01:10:43,567 --> 01:10:44,966

946
01:10:45,047 --> 01:10:47,007
..I'm not your guy anymore?

947
01:10:47,088 --> 01:10:49,932

Oh, you're so salty!

1040
01:17:16,204 --> 01:17:18,127
Yeah! You're...

1041
01:17:18,246 --> 01:17:19,287
..salty too.

1042
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,289
Say it like you mean it.

1043
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,052
Say I'm better than Needy.
- What? Why?

1044
01:17:26,494 --> 01:17:33,020
<i>Take my breath as your own.</i>

1045
01:17:33,101 --> 01:17:39,668
<i>Take my eyes to guide you home.</i>

1046
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:43,632
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1047
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:47,076
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1048
01:17:47,155 --> 01:17:50,399
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1049
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,722
<i>I'm still here...</i>

1050
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:55,003
Chip!

1051
01:17:55,244 --> 01:17:58,767
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1052
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:02,212
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1053
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:05,535
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1054
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:09,137
<i>And I'm still here so...</i>

1055
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:12,421
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1056
01:18:12,622 --> 01:18:15,864
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1057
01:18:15,945 --> 01:18:19,188
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1058
01:18:19,668 --> 01:18:22,793
<i>And I'm still here...</i>

1059
01:18:22,992 --> 01:18:26,115
<i>Because you're not coming back.</i>

1060
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:52,221
What are you doing?
- Swimming.

1061
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,225
Come on, Chip.

1062
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:58,669
Show me your breast stroke.

1063
01:19:12,683 --> 01:19:14,724
I feel so empty.

1064
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,250
Yeah, me too.

1065
01:19:23,573 --> 01:19:26,295
Please just come here and kiss me again.

1066
01:19:36,386 --> 01:19:37,909
I can't.

1067
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,791
I'm sorry.

1068
01:19:41,231 --> 01:19:43,154
This just feels weird.

1069
01:20:21,592 --> 01:20:23,514
Help!

1070
01:20:50,062 --> 01:20:51,703
Needy.

1071
01:21:20,093 --> 01:21:21,734
Needy.

1072
01:21:45,678 --> 01:21:47,199
She can fly?

1073
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,881
She's just hovering.

1074
01:21:48,961 --> 01:21:49,841
It's not that impressive.

1075
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:53,406
God, do you have to undermine
everything that I do?

1076
01:21:53,566 --> 01:21:55,768
You're such a player-hater.

1077
01:21:56,088 --> 01:21:57,609
You're a jerk.

1078
01:21:57,649 --> 01:22:00,413
Wow! Nice insult, Hannah Montana!

1079
01:22:00,573 --> 01:22:01,934
You got any more harsh digs?

1080
01:22:02,014 --> 01:22:03,696
You know what?

1081
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:05,859
You were never a good friend.

1082
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:08,780
Even when we were little.
You used to steal my toys...

1083
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:12,784
..pour lemonade on my bed.
- And now I'm eating your boyfriend!

1084
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,187
See, atleast I'm consistent.

1085
01:22:15,307 --> 01:22:18,151
Why do you need him? Huh?

1086
01:22:18,471 --> 01:22:20,994
You could have anybody,
you think want, Jennifer.

1087
01:22:21,073 --> 01:22:23,756
So..why Chip?

1088
01:22:23,836 --> 01:22:26,158
Is it just to piss me off?

1089
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:29,762
Or is it because you're just really insecure?

1090
01:22:30,603 --> 01:22:32,525
I'm not insecure, Needy.

1091
01:22:32,525 --> 01:22:33,486
God, that's a joke!

1092
01:22:33,486 --> 01:22:37,371
How can I ever be insecure?
I was the Snowflake Queen!

1093
01:22:37,491 --> 01:22:38,772
Yeah...

1094
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:41,375
..two years ago.
When you were socially relevant.

1095
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:43,217
I'm still socially relevant.

1096
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:46,819
And when you didn't need laxatives
to stay skinny.

1097
01:22:50,343 --> 01:22:52,145
I'm going...

1098
01:22:52,226 --> 01:22:54,427
..to eat your soul...

1099
01:22:54,508 --> 01:22:57,630
..and shit it out, Lesnicki.

1100
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:59,594
I thought you only murdered boys.

1101
01:22:59,714 --> 01:23:01,435
I go both ways.

1102
01:23:30,064 --> 01:23:31,985
Do you have a tampon?

1103
01:23:34,829 --> 01:23:36,470
Thought I'd ask.

1104
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:39,473
You seemed like you might be plugging.

1105
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:01,855
Oh, Chip!

1106
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,658
Needy.

1107
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,943
I should have believed you.

1108
01:24:09,584 --> 01:24:10,785
I'm sorry.

1109
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:14,309
No, no! Listen to me! Listen to me!
I'll dial & get some help, okay?

1110
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,871
Okay?
Yeah, okay.

1111
01:24:23,837 --> 01:24:25,760
It's not working.

1112
01:24:27,882 --> 01:24:28,884
Come on.

1113
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:30,886
Needy. Needy.

1114
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:33,809
I'm going somewhere.

1115
01:24:33,888 --> 01:24:35,610
No! No, no, no.
you're not going anywhere.

1116
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,371
Yes, I'm!

1117
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:39,815
I think I already died before you got here,

1118
01:24:39,894 --> 01:24:42,617
..but I woke up when I heard your voice.

1119
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,142
I love you.

1120
01:24:50,787 --> 01:24:52,828
I love you too.

1121
01:24:56,911 --> 01:24:59,635
And you look totally hot in that dress.

1122
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,557
Oh, God!
You're clearly delirious.

1123
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:05,320
No, I'm not.

1124
01:25:10,445 --> 01:25:11,567
Chip?

1125
01:25:11,847 --> 01:25:13,408
No!

1126
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:15,972
No-o-o!

1127
01:25:20,736 --> 01:25:22,658
No...!

1128
01:26:35,372 --> 01:26:37,694
Best friends forever, huh?

1129
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:40,537
You killed my fucking boyfriend!

1130
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:44,262
You goddamned monster!
You..Zombitch!

1131
01:26:51,828 --> 01:26:53,750
You know what this is for?

1132
01:26:55,552 --> 01:26:57,474
It's for cutting boxes.

1133
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:02,239
Do you buy all your  murder weapons
at Home Depot?

1134
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,241
God, you're butch.

1135
01:27:06,884 --> 01:27:08,805
Cross out Jennifer!

1136
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,402
My tit!

1137
01:28:25,763 --> 01:28:27,004
No...

1138
01:28:27,286 --> 01:28:28,927
..your heart.

1139
01:28:49,028 --> 01:28:51,470
Oh, Jennifer!
What's is it, baby?

1140
01:28:54,193 --> 01:28:56,114
Needy?

1141
01:28:56,835 --> 01:28:58,758
Oh, my God!

1142
01:28:59,397 --> 01:29:01,320
Oh, my God!

1143
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:07,406
Oh, my God!

1144
01:29:23,902 --> 01:29:26,906
<i>I don't know who Needy Lesnicki
is anymore.</i>

1145
01:29:36,515 --> 01:29:38,157
<i>I'm a different person now.</i>

1146
01:29:38,397 --> 01:29:40,199
<i>A person who uses curse words...</i>

1147
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,203
<i>..and kicks orderlies and sees things
that aren't there.</i>

1148
01:29:43,403 --> 01:29:46,125
<i>A very bad, very damaged person.</i>

1149
01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:49,008
<i>But sometimes, change can be good.</i>

1150
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:51,610
<i>For instance, most occult scholars
don't know this...</i>

1151
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:53,453
<i>..but if you're bitten by a demon...</i>

1152
01:29:53,653 --> 01:29:54,894
<i>..and you live...</i>

1153
01:29:55,174 --> 01:29:58,017
<i>..you just might absorb some of
the demon's abilities.</i>

1154
01:29:58,218 --> 01:30:01,301
<i>You just might get lucky for once
in your miserable life.</i>

1155
01:31:20,182 --> 01:31:24,225
Where you looking to go, young lady?
- East, towards Madisson.

1156
01:31:25,186 --> 01:31:27,108
Hop in my chariot.

1157
01:31:33,915 --> 01:31:35,797
So why you headed East?

1158
01:31:36,798 --> 01:31:38,719
I'm following this rock band.

1159
01:31:40,562 --> 01:31:42,483
Must be one in hell of a group.

1160
01:31:42,724 --> 01:31:45,046
Tonight's gonna be their last show.

1161
01:31:46,528 --> 01:31:48,449
<b>"Violet"

01:31:54,336 --> 01:31:57,980
<i>And all the stars look just like little fish.</i>

1164
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:03,185
<i>You should learn when to go.</i>

1165
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:08,950
<i>You should learn how to say no.</i>

1166
01:32:11,033 --> 01:32:13,755
<i>Might last a day, yeah-h-h!</i>

1167
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,158
<i>Mine is forever.</i>

1168
01:32:16,438 --> 01:32:20,482
<i>Might last a day, yeah-h-h!</i>

1169
01:32:22,444 --> 01:32:24,406
<i>Well, mine is forever.</i>

1170
01:32:24,526 --> 01:32:29,932
<i>When they get what they want,
they never want it again.</i>

<i>When they get what they want,
they never want it again.</i>

1172
01:32:35,537 --> 01:32:40,783

Hey, look at this motherfucker.

1175
01:32:50,393 --> 01:32:52,035
Go open the door.
