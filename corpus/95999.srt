00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,429
<i>The Vikings in Europe</i>
<i>of the eighth and ninth century</i>

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,315
<i>were dedicated to a pagan</i>
<i>god of war, Odin.</i>

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,550
<i>Cramped by the confines</i>
<i>of their barren, icebound northlands,</i>

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,114
<i>they exploited their skill as shipbuilders</i>

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,234
<i>to spread a reign of terror</i>
<i>then unequalled in violence and brutality</i>

6
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,113
<i>in all the records of history.</i>

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,551
<i>The greatest wish of every Viking</i>

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,593
<i>was to die sword in hand</i>
<i>and enter Valhalla,</i>

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,269
<i>where a hero's welcome</i>
<i>awaited them from the god Odin.</i>

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,830
<i>The compass was unknown,</i>

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,714
<i>and they could steer only</i>
<i>by the sun and the stars.</i>

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,711
<i>Once fog closed in,</i>
<i>they were left helpless and blind.</i>

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,274
<i>After all, the earth was flat.</i>

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,029
<i>Sail too far off course,</i>
<i>and the black wind would blow them</i>

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,674
<i>across the poison sea</i>
<i>that lay to the west</i>

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,156
<i>and over the edge of the world</i>
<i>into limbo.</i>

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,553
<i>Their abiding aim</i>
<i>was to conquer England,</i>

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,152
<i>then a series of petty kingdoms,</i>
<i>each one the jealous rival of the next.</i>

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,435
<i>Thus, when the Vikings set forth</i>
<i>to rob and plunder England,</i>

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,313
<i>they never sailed out of sight of land.</i>

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,319
<i>They confined their attacks</i>
<i>to swift overnight raids.</i>

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,718
<i>It was no accident that the English book</i>
<i>of prayer contained this sentence. ;</i>

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,879
<i>"Protect us, oh Lord,</i>
<i>from the wrath of the Northmen. "</i>

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,198
- Ragnar!

29
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,119
The king is dead. Long live the king.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,838
For two months we have mourned
the good King Edwin,

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,396
who by the cruel Viking Ragnar
was foully murdered,

32
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,229
and still lies unrevenged.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,992
The council of the kingdom now declare
that Aella is of the true royal line

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,556
and welcome his succession
to the throne.

36
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,709
Your Majesty.

37
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
Thank you, my gracious lady.

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,149
Rest assured that the barbarians
that murdered your husband, my cousin,

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,829
will soon feel the weight of my anger.

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,758
And though your union with Edwin
was fruitless,

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,919
feel confident that you retain
the respect of us all.

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,992
You may retire... Queen Enid.

43
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,915
We, Thurston Bishop
and Matthew Bishop,

44
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,431
ask you, will you take Aella
as your king and accept...

45
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,109
You need not fear, my lady.
His words cannot hurt you.

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,118
He has no right to the throne.

47
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,993
There is no direct heir, my lady.

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,315
There is an heir.

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,075
What?

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,557
Brother Godwin, I am with child.
But not Edwin's.

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,195
The child is that of the Viking, Ragnar.

54
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,276
A bad omen.

55
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,114
The holy sword Requitur,
the sword of kings.

56
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,117
Long live the king!

57
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,317
He is the son of a barbarian...
but I love him as if he were Edwin's child.

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,513
There are already rumours of his birth.
If they were to reach Aella...

59
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,392
Where are you sending him?

60
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,389
To Italy, to be tended by monks
who will not know his identity.

61
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,274
But his life will be safe, and yours too.

62
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,755
Father Godwin!

63
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,435
- The pommelstone of the sword Requitur.
- It is his by right.

64
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,351
If you hope to identify him in years to
come by this stone, so can his enemies.

65
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,832
<i>20 years passed.</i>
<i>Queen Enid had died,</i>

66
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,317
<i>but the rumour that she had given birth</i>
<i>to a son continued to plague King Aella.</i>

67
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,352
<i>Although his castle became</i>
<i>the stronghold of all England,</i>

68
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,631
<i>Aella was unable to stop the Viking raids.</i>

69
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,830
Now let it be known throughout
the kingdom of Northumbria

70
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,590
that I, King Rhodri of Wales,
bestow on King Aella

71
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,269
the hand of my daughter, Morgana.

72
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,755
I will consent to this.

73
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,196
I, too, King Rhodri of Wales, consent.

74
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,992
Praise be to God.

75
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,315
Amen.

76
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,389
Please rise, child.

77
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,033
On the first day of spring,
you will become my bride.

78
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,240
I trust, Lord Egbert,
that you approve of this alliance?

79
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,793
With all my heart, sire.

80
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,959
Then why do you spread tales of an heir
to the throne left by Queen Enid?

82
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,392
'Tis common knowledge, sire.

83
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,592
The queen on her deathbed
spoke of a son sent off to Italy

84
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,678
with the pommelstone of the
sword Requitur tied about him.

85
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,793
Your Majesty, is it wise to speak
of things so long in the past?

86
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,311
I hope soon to silence
these wagging tongues.

87
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,671
This beautiful child will present me
with an heir to the throne.

88
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,473
And this marriage
will combine our strengths

89
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,751
and protect our people
from the depredation of the Vikings.

91
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,190
That is not enough!

92
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,312
I must also expose a traitor in our midst.

93
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,319
Surely there are no traitors
in this hall, sire.

94
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,512
Cousin Egbert... why have your lands
never been attacked by the Vikings?

95
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,593
What do you mean, sire?

96
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,599
Neither your lands nor those of your
conspirators have suffered any harm.

97
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,915
- Conspirators?!
- You have schemed against me.

98
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,077
I'll not be the scapegoat
for your failure to stop the Vikings!

99
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,998
You have conspired with the foes
of England to dethrone me!

100
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,918
- What foes?
- The Vikings! Take him out!

101
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,476
Lies will not sustain a tyrant!

102
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,232
Use skill. It must appear
as if he took his own life.

103
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,472
- He's gone, sire!
- Hunt him down.

104
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,794
Bring me his head!

106
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,589
Hail, Ragnar!

107
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,951
- We've waited half the night.
- I nearly didn't get here at all.

108
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,755
Aella knows of our meetings.
You've got to take me with you!

109
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,838
He's no more use to us. Send him back.

110
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,077
That's no way to reward a man
who's guided our raids.

111
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,589
No, we'll find good use for him.

112
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,836
Come aboard.

113
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,511
- Make sail for Long Sound.
- Make sail for Long Sound!

118
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,072
Shh.

119
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,311
Ragnar!

120
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,349
Come on.

122
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,910
Hail, Ragnar! Hail, Ragnar! Hail, Ragnar!

124
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,272
Hail, Ragnar!

125
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,119
Hail, Einar!

126
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,391
I drink to your safe return in English ale!

127
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,873
- I wish that it were English blood.

128
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,675
Hold your mouth!
This is an Englishman.

129
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,670
- Englishman?
- Lord Egbert. An ally.

130
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,517
Then drink to my father's return,
Englishman.

132
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,471
Do you want the English
to think we're barbarians?

133
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,034
This is Einar, my only son in wedlock.

134
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,993
He's so vain of his beauty,
he won't let a man's beard hide it.

135
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,317
He scrapes his face like an Englishman.

136
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,558
Hail, Ragnar. And hail, Ragnar's beard.

137
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,632
- I want you to teach Egbert our customs.
- I'll teach him.

138
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,638
- Remember I live by brains, not brawn.
- Yes, my lord.

139
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,512
- Then fetch him a horse.
- Now?

140
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,153
Why not?

141
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,196
- Einar... Gently, gently.
- I know. Brains, not brawn.

142
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,269
He's got to draw us maps
of the English coast!

143
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,759
What man ever had a finer son?

144
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,270
Odin could have sired him, but I did.

145
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,356
Come!

147
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,559
Don't be frightened.
She's forbidden to hunt Englishmen.

148
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,911
- Too much for her to swallow.
- We have the same sport in England.

149
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,157
With hawks like this? Watch.

150
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,469
Kill.

152
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,636
You call that a hawk?

154
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,679
I think we have hawks to equal that one.

155
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,917
Here. Bring up Long Claw.

156
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,838
Look, now there's a hunting bird.

157
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,715
- You again. Whose bird is that?
- It's mine.

158
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,071
Oh? A slave with a hunting hawk?

159
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,749
- I found her frozen to a tree.
- Where'd you steal it?

160
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,440
Sandpiper was with me when I found her.

161
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,475
The perfect witness - deaf and dumb.
Perhaps you'd like <i>your</i> tongue cut out.

162
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,558
- Then you'd tell no more lies.
- I'm not a liar.

163
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,191
Is this the way slaves talk to Vikings?

164
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,320
Tell the English lord that you're a liar.

165
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,075
Kill!

166
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,236
Kill him!

167
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,716
No!

168
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,352
Don't kill him.

170
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,432
Odin!

171
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,393
Odin!

172
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,508
Bring in the slave.

173
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,194
Look how he glares at me.

174
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,348
If he wasn't fathered by a black ram in the
full of the moon, my name is not Ragnar.

175
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,429
What would you do with him
in your country?

176
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,155
We have a special reward which is
rather entertaining in a noisy way.

177
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,590
- What's that?
- Nothing much, just a pit full of wolves,

178
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,111
half mad with starvation and trained
to appreciate the flavour of human blood.

179
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,552
Ah, you see! The English <i>are</i> civilised.

180
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,037
- Can you think of anything worse?
- I can think of something far worse.

181
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,517
I guess you can, with your
pretty dainty face spoiled.

182
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,279
But he was a good slave. Kill him quick.

183
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,679
- No. No quick death for him.
- What do you suggest I do with him?

184
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,514
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

185
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,308
I want this slave alive.

186
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,749
After tearing your face apart?

187
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,199
Yes.

188
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,075
The sun will cross the sky
a thousand times before he dies.

189
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,317
And you'll wish a thousand times
that you were dead.

190
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,036
Kitala!

191
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,108
You can't kill the slave.

192
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,275
What do the runes say?

193
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,430
If Odin willed that Eric should die, Thor's
hammer would sound his death knell.

194
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,672
But the sky is silent.

195
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,037
The curse of Odin waits on him
who kills the slave.

196
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,196
Then no <i>man</i> shall kill him.
Let the tide of the sea do it.

197
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,953
Bind him, cast him into the slop-pool
at low tide! Take him out!

198
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,677
You'll throw him into the slop-pool
to be drowned and eaten by crabs?

199
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,395
Then let the crabs be cursed by Odin!
That's my decision.

200
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,275
If he survives the pool, what then?

201
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,515
If he's still alive when the tide turns,

202
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,598
then any fool who fishes him out
can have him!

203
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,676
Survives!

204
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,635
Odin! Odin!

205
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,752
Send a wind and turn the tide.

206
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,479
Odin! Odin!

207
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,554
Odin!

208
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,989
Put her on the testing board.

209
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,199
I think I'll go and watch
that slave drowning.

210
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,074
Stay here!
You'll see something more interesting.

211
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,034
It does look rather an interesting game.

212
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,278
It's not a game.
It's Odin's test for unfaithful wives.

213
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,555
Is she an unfaithful wife?

214
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,595
- Ask Einar.
- Her husband says she is.

215
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,518
- Which is he?
- He's throwing the axes.

216
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,671
But, uh... if she's innocent?

217
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,156
Her husband will succeed,
the braids will be cut.

218
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,120
Supposing he misses
the braids and hits her?

219
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,789
- Well, then she's guilty.
- I see.

220
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,791
But what happens if he misses
both the girl and the braids?

221
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,718
Three misses and we drown <i>him!</i>

222
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,756
One!

223
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,714
You're too drunk!
You'll split her wide open!

224
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,000
Drunk, am I? I haven't had enough!

226
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,630
You missed her, didn't you?

227
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,555
What a son!

228
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,191
Kitala.

229
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,232
Kitala, my legs, my legs...

230
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,909
Move your legs, Eric.
You must move them.

231
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,592
- Where did this slave boy come from?
- Bjorn brought him here from a raid.

232
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,996
He was taken from a ship on the sea.

233
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,759
- And this was found about his neck?
- Yes.

234
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,919
It's the only possession he ever had.
He has no need of it now.

236
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,075
He's going to die.

237
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,638
Listen to me, little slave. Einar is
in the hall celebrating your death!

238
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,354
Einar is laughing at you!

239
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,948
Einar... Einar.

240
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,309
- Live, Eric. Fight the cold.
- Live and fight Einar.

241
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,958
Fight Einar. Fight Einar.

242
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,877
Odin. Odin.

243
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,877
Odin!

244
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,070
- Odin has answered you.
- They were only flying clouds.

245
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,591
You're blind.
They were Odin's daughters.

246
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,316
I heard the singing of their battle swords
as they rode across the sky.

247
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,556
They bring the wind.

248
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,036
They bring the wind!

249
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,355
Listen to it.

252
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,634
The north wind, it's turning back the tide.
Cut him loose.

253
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,389
The tide is going out. Your job is done.

254
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,114
I'll take the slave.

255
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,078
He's mine, Einar! The wind
turned the tide and I pulled him out.

256
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,760
I'll take him, Englishman.

257
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,031
If your father's word
means anything, he's mine.

258
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,675
Why such a sudden interest
in a slave, my lord?

259
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,917
Shall we say, an English passion
for converting the wicked

260
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,430
to the paths of righteousness.

261
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,112
Well, you're not in England now.

262
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,398
And you never will be unless
I draw maps of England for your father.

263
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,230
All right.

264
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,751
You can keep the slave...
for as long as you live.

265
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,952
- Odin's thanks for saving him.
- And at no little risk to myself.

266
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,799
Do you know what this is?

267
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,834
Some day, I'll tell you what it is.

268
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,509
And you'll remember then
that I saved you.

269
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,398
I'm still a slave.

270
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,354
- You won't be when we get to England.
- I'll never get to England.

271
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,950
You're like a wounded animal.
You trust no one.

272
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,150
- Good day, my lords.
- Hail, Egbert!

273
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,636
- How's the boat coming along?
- She'll be ready in a week.

274
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,558
Well, she's no sea dragon,
but she'll do for a toy.

275
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,989
Does Einar still bear me a grudge?

276
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,157
You were a fool to anger my son.
He'll kill you one day.

277
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,317
You're not still angry, are you, Einar?

278
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,000
- That depends.
- On what?

279
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,836
On how well you draw maps.

280
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,715
See for yourself.
This is a map of Wales.

281
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,958
Wales? That slag heap?
That's not worth one night's raiding.

282
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,675
It holds the richest prize of all:
King Rhodri's daughter, Morgana.

283
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,270
Ha! Rhodri couldn't raise enough
to ransom a Skagerrak moose.

284
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,473
No, but Aella could.
He's to marry her in the spring.

285
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,874
Oh?

286
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,791
Einar, I think our Englishman
has a good idea.

287
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,515
She's leaving soon
and must go round this point.

288
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,074
- Here? You're sure?
- I'd stake my life on it.

289
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,668
You already have.

290
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,190
Let me intercept her
and bring her back here.

291
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,675
- How many men would you need?
- One boat.

292
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,552
- Only one boat?
- No more.

293
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,753
What about him without the collar?
Would you take him along?

294
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,632
Well, naturally I'd take along my slave.

295
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,833
You stay here and draw maps.
I'll kidnap the girl.

296
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,397
Get him to draw maps that'll guide a ship
through fog - then he'll be worth keeping.

297
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,354
- There is no map of any use in fog.
- Then what use are you to us?

298
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,996
Think of that while I'm gone. And don't
let anything happen to that slave.

299
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,234
It's a strange metal
that fell to earth from the North Star.

300
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,920
Sandpiper brought it from far away.

301
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,715
The price he paid
was his ears and his tongue.

302
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,197
No matter how you hold it,
it struggles to return homeward

303
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,155
to the star from which it fell.
It always points to the north.

304
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,717
Not in the fog.
You cannot see the stars in the fog.

305
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,756
Watch.

306
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,396
Can it see the star through these walls?

307
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,194
This could lead you to many places.

308
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,235
Even to the land beyond
the poison sea, Valhalla.

309
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,351
You will go there one day.

310
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,358
Only great heroes have ever reached it.

311
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,230
See what the runes say.

312
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,190
Will this take me there?

313
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,036
No.

314
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,153
A woman will point the way.

315
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,110
- What will she look like?
- You will know her when you see her.

316
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,357
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

317
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,073
Will she love me or hate me?

318
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,557
Love and hate are horns
on the same goat.

319
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,080
What woman would ever look at a slave?

320
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,475
This one will.

321
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,396
You're lying, Kitala.

322
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,954
All your tales are lies.

323
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,230
Don't look so sad, my lady.
It doesn't become you.

324
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,079
Bridget, how can I marry a man
that I hate?

325
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,431
It's not easy to be a princess,
but you have a duty.

326
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,758
This alliance will help your people.
You must marry Aella.

327
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,757
I would rather that I were dead.

328
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,917
The Vikings! Turn back! It's the Vikings!

329
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,833
Quick, my ladies, inside.

330
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,270
Steersmen, cut to the wind!
Forecastle men forward!

331
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,429
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she's worthless in trade!

332
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,553
All pull at the bowline!

333
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,230
Bend your backs!

334
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,435
Oh! No! No!

335
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,236
Bridget!

336
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,920
- My lady!
- No!

337
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,759
- No! No!
- My lady... help!

338
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,829
My lady... 

339
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,631
Bridget! Bridget!

341
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,350
My lady!

342
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,718
- Bridget!

343
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,796
Bridget!

344
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,155
Welcome aboard, my lady.

345
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,032
Aella will kill you for this.

346
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,277
Aella? It would be a pity
to send you back to <i>him.</i>

347
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,709
What do you know of Aella?

348
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,549
Well, I know he'll pay all the treasure
he's got to get you back.

349
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,920
I'll keep you for myself.

350
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,153
By Odin, she'd make a fine Viking queen.

352
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,197
Get away from me!

353
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,357
Hey, now first a little kiss of welcome.

354
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,914
Get away!

355
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,994
- A little kiss of welcome.
- No!

356
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,838
Yes.

358
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,756
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she'll be worthless in trade.

359
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,954
Pretty bird, pretty feathers.
Build her a nest so she can hide.

360
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,880
Too many hawks around here!

361
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,198
- Make sail!
- Make sail.

362
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,036
Einar!

365
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,518
Hail, Einar!

366
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,033
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

368
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,036
Stop rowing.

369
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,354
Oars down!

370
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,194
- Hail, Einar.
- Hail, Ragnar.

371
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,993
I give thanks to Odin for your safe return.

372
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,918
- Well, where is she?
- Where's who?

373
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,474
Who do you think?
Your friend with the pigtails?!

374
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,559
Oh, stop shouting. You sound like
a moose giving birth to a hedgehog.

375
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,274
- Einar!
- Get this grain ashore.

376
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,119
I wanna know why you missed
the wench you were sent for.

377
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,437
- I didn't miss her.
- Where is she?

378
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,996
Ah...

379
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,954
A little skinny, perhaps,
but not bad. Not bad at all.

380
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,911
Restrain yourself, my lord.

381
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,477
If she is dishonoured, she'll be worthless
as a queen and Aella won't ransom her.

382
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,071
- I don't need traitors to plead my cause.
- My quarrel is with Aella, lady, not you.

383
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,668
We agreed you would be unharmed.

384
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,475
- Remember that, Einar. Leave her alone.
- I haven't touched her... yet.

385
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,160
And you never will. I'd kill myself first.

386
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,191
- Ah. She doesn't seem to like you.
- She likes me well enough.

387
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,629
I doubt it, from the looks of her.

388
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,830
So do I.

389
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,755
- But the time will come.
- Never.

390
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,836
Never?

391
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,272
You like the scars on my face,
don't you, hm?

392
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,916
Sure, my beauty stirs her little heart.

393
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,713
You have better luck with falcons.
She'll never call <i>you</i> dainty-face! 

394
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,037
Any objections?

395
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,594
Of course not, my lord. He's just a slave.

396
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,030
- Let's go ashore and take her along.
- She stays here.

397
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,431
We'll talk about her again,
when you're more drunk or more sober.

398
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:53,157
Olaf! Anchor the boat out on the fjord.
And guard her well.

400
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,757
Ah, come. You'll soon forget the wench.

401
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,350
- She's too skinny anyhow.
- She's beautiful.

402
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,953
Ah, all those bones sticking out, she's an
old crow with all the feathers pulled out.

403
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,719
She said she'd kill herself
if I touched her.

404
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,789
They all say that. What they really mean
is they'll kill themselves if you <i>don't.</i>

405
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,198
Maybe, but I've never had one
spit on me and bite me.

406
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,235
Huh! They'll bite all the more
now that you're Einar One-Eye.

407
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,239
I wanted to thank you
for proving me innocent.

408
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,590
Go back to your husband.

409
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,875
Come. Drink.
No one woman is worth all this fuss.

410
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,070
Well, my lady,
as terrible as this captivity is,

411
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,591
at least we should be thankful
that so far our honour has been spared.

412
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,553
Yes, Bridget,
we have that to be thankful for.

413
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,639
Strange how things never
turn out the way you expect.

414
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,469
I always thought Vikings
attacked their women.

415
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,352
We've been very lucky.

416
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,153
It hasn't been due
entirely to luck, Bridget.

417
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,034
He can't help the way he acts.
He's a pagan, my lady.

418
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,436
- He's a mad dog.
- Well...

419
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,633
If it weren't for the scars on his face,
he'd be rather nice looking.

420
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,228
Oh, for a Viking, I mean.

421
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,874
I don't want to talk about him.

422
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,355
Scratches and bites
won't hold him off for ever.

423
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,031
What a son!

424
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,598
How about my mother?

425
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,314
Tell me, did my mother fight you?

426
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,792
Ah, did she fight me.

427
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,471
I have the scars of her scratches
and bites all over me.

428
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,433
Ha! What a woman.

429
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,594
That's how I feel about Morgana.

430
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,112
Look at me.

431
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,392
Do you think with this face I want
the kind of wife who'd <i>let</i> me touch her?

432
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,073
I want her to fight me tooth and nail,
the first time I take her and the last.

433
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,756
You are my son.

434
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,470
And you'll be wearing this one day.
Don't forget that.

435
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,716
I won't forget it.

436
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:47,038
Now... if you really want her,
as skinny as she is, I give her to you.

437
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,072
Wait a minute. What do you mean, you...

438
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,999
- You mean we won't ransom her?
- No! You can have her.

439
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,713
Oh, I'll give this little wench from Wales
a reason to bite and scratch.

440
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,352
I'm Einar!

441
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,596
Son of Ragnar!

442
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,238
I'll show her what forging can be done
when fire fights fire!

443
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,751
I'll make her howl
till they hear her in Wales!

445
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,949
Morgana!

446
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,953
My pretty little bird,
sharpen your claws!

448
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,189
I'm Einar!

449
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,953
All right, men! Everybody off!

450
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,277
Morgana and I wanna be alone.

451
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,755
Good job, mate!

452
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,199
Agh... Olaf!

453
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,874
Thank you, Olaf!

454
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,629
Morgana! Out! Out!

455
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,514
- We don't need you.
- I can't swim!

456
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,793
If you touch me, I'll kill myself.

457
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,552
There's a sword to do it with...

458
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,750
because I'm going to touch you.

459
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,791
Scratch.

460
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,989
Come on.

461
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,918
- Fight!
- A woman can't fight a man.

462
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,669
You wench! Kick, bite, scratch!

463
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,276
Now come on.

464
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,116
Fight me.

465
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,909
I will not lift one finger to resist you.

466
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,790
Whatever you do
will be on your conscience.

467
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,831
Then let it be on my conscience.

468
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,236
- I've come to help you escape.
- Escape?

469
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,069
- I've stolen a ship.
- My lady, it's a tiny boat. We'll drown.

470
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,792
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.

471
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,354
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

472
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,040
My lady, how do you know
you can trust this slave?

473
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,357
I know. If you don't want
to come, you can stay.

474
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,710
Wait. Wait for me.

475
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,712
Our only chance
is to get far away by morning.

476
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,035
Yes, I can see that.

477
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,837
We'd go a lot faster if we all rowed.

478
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,110
Would we?

479
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,674
Yes, we would.

480
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,870
Do you mean that I should row this boat?

481
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,150
Yes, I do mean that.

482
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,476
Impossible.

483
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,115
- Get an oar and row.
- But a princess doesn't row a boat.

484
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,598
- Get an oar and row.
- But I can't. I don't know how.

485
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,870
Learn. You too.

486
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,753
Oh!

487
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,036
- What's the matter now?
- This bodice is too tight. I'll have to stop.

488
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,879
- What's a bodice?
- This dress I'm wearing.

489
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,992
It's too tight right in there... Oh!

490
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,516
- Row.
- Mine isn't too tight.

491
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,514
Eric, look!

492
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,237
It's Einar. Turn! Turn!

493
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,076
- They are heading for the fog.
- We'll get them!

494
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,630
- We can't go into the fog.
- Keep rowing.

495
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,676
Faster! Faster!

496
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,634
The men are afraid
we'll run aground. So am I.

497
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,069
Keep rowing!

498
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,637
Faster! Faster!

499
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,471
Look out!

500
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,030
Grab hold of the mast.

501
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,912
Stop rowing.

502
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,269
Odin! Odin!

503
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,149
I'm going under!

504
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,156
Hold on!

505
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,990
Lift me out.

506
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,509
Oh!

507
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,356
Over here!

508
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,348
Over here!

509
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,555
Back to your oars!

510
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,835
- Back to your oars!
- Give up the chase.

511
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,474
Morgana's out there! After them!

512
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:53,390
The Great Snake is sunk.
You want to wreck this ship too?

513
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,272
Ragnar.

514
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,278
Ragnar! Ragnar!

515
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,958
- Where's Ragnar?
- At the bottom of the fjord.

516
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,636
The curse of Odin on that slave!

517
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,312
If I have to cross the poison sea,
I'll find him.

518
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,639
I swear it... by the sacred blood of Odin.

519
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,390
Still afraid?

520
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,036
No. I'm worth more alive
than dead. Are you?

521
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,039
No. But I value my life much more now.

522
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,396
Of course, I'm grateful to you for saving
me and Aella will certainly reward you...

523
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,954
- Why should I take you back to Aella?
- But you must.

524
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,798
Why?

525
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,711
I'm pledged to him on my father's word.

526
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,075
I didn't steal you away
just to give you to another man.

527
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,389
Aella isn't another man. He's a king.

528
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,876
And I'm a slave.

529
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,272
And I loved you the moment I saw you.

530
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,480
I loved you even before then.

531
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,429
Kitala saw it in the runes.

532
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,197
That's just Kitala's silly talk.

533
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,670
Do you love Aella?

534
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,513
I belong to him...
by my father's word as a Christian king.

535
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,074
What's your father's word
compared to Odin's will?

536
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,397
Do you know which of all the oceans
is the widest?

537
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,080
The poison sea.

538
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,357
No.

539
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,438
The ocean between
a Christian and a heathen.

540
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,836
Our hands can reach across it
as easily as that.

541
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,190
But that's just a joining of the flesh.

542
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,350
- What else is missing?
- The joining of our souls.

543
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,711
If our hands are touching,
our souls must be touching.

544
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,149
But your soul is heathen.

545
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:53,034
If my soul is content to be heathen
and yours content to be Christian,

546
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,153
let's not question flesh
for wanting to remain flesh.

547
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,116
Kitala.

548
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,915
We'll be in England soon.

549
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,477
Suppose Aella releases you
from your pledge.

550
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,154
Then I'd be free.

551
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,236
But why should he?

552
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,230
I'll find a way.

553
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,958
How can I make you understand?

554
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,391
What would be the worst thing
for a Viking?

555
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,276
To die without a sword in his hand
and never enter Valhalla.

556
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,473
For me to break my pledge to Aella
would be as bad as that.

557
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,150
I'll find a way.

558
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,269
You captured Ragnar single-handed?

559
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,556
We all owe you our thanks.

560
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,797
I don't want your thanks. I want Morgana.

561
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,676
This barbarian is under the illusion you
desire to be released from your pledge.

562
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,870
Do you release me?

563
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,992
Surely you don't want to be released?

564
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,270
- Yes, I do.
- That is absurd.

565
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,834
- Sire, you gave your word.
- Of course.

566
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,155
But first things first.

567
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,114
Father Godwin, take the
Princess Morgana to the chapel,

568
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,994
that she may meditate
before making a final decision.

569
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,116
Yes, sire.

570
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,793
Well, gentlemen,
let us proceed to the kennels.

571
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,195
The royal pets are hungry.

572
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,276
Take him.

573
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,914
That stone, my lady...

574
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,793
- Where did you get it?
- Eric gave it to me.

575
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,672
Where did he get it?

576
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,635
He said it was tied around his neck
when the Vikings captured him as a baby.

578
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,190
Since you brought him here,
the pleasure shall be yours.

579
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,316
Push him in.

580
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,312
I claim the right of a Viking
to die with a sword in my hand.

581
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,034
And I deny you that right.

582
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,232
Go ahead. Push him in.

583
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,713
Cut my bonds and give me the sword.

584
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,990
Why should I?

585
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,794
Would you deny me
the right to enter Valhalla?

586
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,035
What are you doing?

587
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,950
You dare give him that sword?

590
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,233
Odin!

592
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,671
And Einar is his brother.

593
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,110
And Eric has surrendered
his own father to Aella.

594
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,437
Oh, Father Godwin,
we must try to stop him.

595
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,233
Yes. Come.

596
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,032
You have dared to defy a king.

597
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,754
You shall join Ragnar in the pit.

598
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,393
I want all here to see the reward
for such defiance.

599
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,080
Your Majesty,
I would ask you to bear in mind

600
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,830
that I made good your promise
in the name of Holy Mother Church.

601
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:58,077
Thank you, Father Godwin.
You are the watchdog of my fury.

602
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,194
But if a common slave
can rob me of a queen

603
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,437
and slay an enemy too cunning
for a whole nation to defeat,

604
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,270
then the day must come when he will be
a deadlier foe than Ragnar ever was.

605
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,791
With or without God's sanction,
I tell you as your king this cannot be.

606
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,957
- Aella...
- Yes, my dear?

607
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,073
I will keep my pledge to you.
Don't kill him.

608
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,869
In that case, nothing could distress me
more than for you to think me cruel.

609
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,116
Then let him go.

610
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,588
Hold out the hand that has defied me.

612
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,709
Let this serve as a lesson to all Vikings.

613
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,718
Take him to his ship and cast him adrift.

614
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,312
Eric!

615
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,630
Why do we wait?

616
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,239
Because of a slave, my father's bones
lie now at the bottom of the fjord.

617
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:44,396
Ragnar was your king.
But he had no Viking's burial.

618
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:51,319
I have sworn by the blood of Odin
to avenge my father's death.

619
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,997
Why do we wait?

620
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,190
We must mourn Ragnar.

621
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,592
It's revenge Ragnar wants, not mourning.

622
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,715
Every Viking wants to revenge
the death of Ragnar.

623
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,434
Then let's go to England now
for the girl and the slave.

624
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,596
We don't even know where they are.

625
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,918
Where would the slave go but to Aella's
castle to be rewarded for his treachery?

626
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,112
Perhaps, but what chance
would we have?

627
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,152
Aella's castle is the strongest
in all of England.

628
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,431
I know Aella's castle well.
Here are the maps.

629
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,994
Einar has studied every stone and beam.

630
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,873
To reach the castle,
we'll have to hug the English coast.

631
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,912
They will have days
to prepare for our attack.

632
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,638
We don't hug the coast.
We sail across the open sea.

633
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,356
- And if there's fog?
- Can't we do what a slave did?

634
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,952
The slave used witchcraft.

635
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,039
His eyes saw through the fog to the stars.

636
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,591
Are you afraid, Bjorn?

637
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,629
Do not confuse fear for caution.

638
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,752
Odin has sent no sign.

639
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,432
Then you can stay here.

640
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,032
But we go to avenge Ragnar's death.
Who sails with me?

641
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,311
Not even enough to man one ship.

642
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,750
Odin.

643
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,470
Odin.

644
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,673
Odin must have answered me.

645
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,271
- Where's Morgana?
- In Aella's castle.

646
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,834
You dare to come back here
just to tell me this?

647
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,520
No. I need you and your men
to take the castle,

648
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,632
and you need me to guide you
across the open sea.

649
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,115
Why should you want me
to free Morgana?

650
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,358
Because she shall be my wife.

651
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,710
All right, slave...

652
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,593
you live until Morgana's free.

653
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,077
Vikings! Vikings!

654
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,237
- Odin <i>has</i> sent us a sign.
- Kill him!

655
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,149
Listen to me!

656
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:21,479
Make no mistake, I hate this slave
more than any living man.

657
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,556
But he can guide us to Morgana.

658
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:29,949
What matters more to you, a foreign
wench or vengeance for Ragnar?

659
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,753
Because of him, your father lies
at the bottom of the fjord.

660
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,634
That's not true! Ragnar died in England!

662
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,635
In the fog he swam to my boat.
I took him there.

663
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,111
How did Ragnar die?

664
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,639
Aella ordered him bound
and thrown alive into the wolf pit.

665
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,194
Ragnar, bound like a sheep
and thrown to wolves?

666
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,755
I cut his bonds.

667
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,758
He died fighting
with the sword I gave him.

668
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,318
And this was my thanks from Aella
for letting Ragnar die like a Viking.

669
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,514
Now you know how Ragnar died.

670
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,595
His eyes can lead us to Aella.

671
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,676
Now!

672
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,031
Who sails with me?

673
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,878
- I will!
- I will!

674
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,432
Hail, Einar!

675
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:55,396
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

677
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,157
Strange, isn't it?

678
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:07,353
I was going to take you to England
and now you're taking me.

679
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,676
Do you still have that stone
you wear about your neck?

680
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,075
No, it's gone.

681
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:20,079
Oh. Just as well.

682
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,156
Why?

683
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,360
I used to think it would bring me luck.

684
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,553
Now neither of us
will have any use for it.

686
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,114
The Vikings!

687
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,708
It's the Vikings!

688
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,035
The Vikings!

689
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,958
Egbert, where would Morgana be?

690
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,550
The safest place is the tower chapel.

691
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,676
Odin!

693
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,108
Be assured, sire, the second drawbridge
is much stronger than the first.

695
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,196
Odin!

696
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,712
Odin!

698
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,712
Aella!

701
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,793
Take your magic elsewhere, holy man.

702
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,713
This chapel is a sanctuary.

703
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,152
Father Godwin!

704
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,030
Go ahead, jump.

705
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,349
You will be my queen.

706
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,036
I knew it the first moment I saw you.

707
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,436
You knew it too.
You knew it that night on my ship.

708
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,879
- It's not true.
- Yes.

709
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,796
It is true.

710
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,750
I don't love you.

711
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:04,196
You must love me exactly as I love you.

712
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,438
I hate you! It's Eric I love.

713
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,870
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Eric... for the last time.

714
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,037
Don't kill him. You can't.

715
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,516
Look at this. It's from the pommel
of the sword Requitur.

716
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,076
It was given to Eric by his mother,
Enid the queen.

717
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,510
Oh, listen to me! Ragnar was his father!

718
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,835
Lies won't save him!

719
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,633
It's true. I swear it is.

720
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,955
He is your brother!

721
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,589
Eric!

722
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,310
Look at him,
how he hastens to his death.

723
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,510
He can't wait to die.

724
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:37,439
If I can't have your love,
I'll take your hate.

726
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:16,588
Why did he hesitate?

727
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,276
Odin!

728
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:19,478
Prepare a funeral for a Viking.
