Beautiful gold and steel cars and trucks.

They aren't just beautiful.
- Come on, Richie.

00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,086
Come on, man.

00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:54,289

turn that damn thing down?

00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,690
- She's on the warpath, man.

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,779
- [Paco] Hey, let me see.

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,139
- It's not for kids.

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,923

00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,009
- What's the matter with you?

46
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,609
I know you're stupid,
but this is too stupid.

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,759
- Come on, Carmencita, give me
the piece, baby, I gotta go.

48
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,479
- You know, I got a sore
throat from arguing with you.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,949
- Yeah, well, this time
you're wrong, all right?

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,229
This time it's the long money.

51

(bullets thump)

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,719
- That's why you need the gun?

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,649
Because it's easy, simple, safe?

55
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,169
- Look, the gun is just
for show, all right?

56
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,079
Nobody is shooting nobody.

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,729
It's a piece of cake, Lyle checked it out.

58
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,909
- Oh, Lyle checked it out.

59
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,743
- [Richie] Yeah.

60
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:35,943
- Why don't that make me feel better?

61
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:38,259
You're a lousy thief, Richie.

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,218
Look for another line of work, please.

63
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,439
(gun clicking)

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,607
- Carmen, hey, will you just listen to me?

65
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,029
They're dentists, okay,
two fucking dentists.

66
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,030
They got nothing but money

67
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,089
and they want to deal some weight.

68
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,459
They're not tough guys, they're dentists.

69
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,809
They're gonna piss,
they'll be in such a hurry

70
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,779
to give us the money when
Lyle and me pull our guns.

71
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,909
- What if they pull their guns?

72
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,939
- They don't got guns, they're dentists.

73
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,999
- Today everybody got guns.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
- Ay, Dios.

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,819
Hey, we're talking about a lot of money.

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,473
Don't put a curse on me, carina.

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,679
- I just get scared for you, Richie.

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
- I know.

79
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,889
- How long you gonna be gone?

80
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,555
- As long as it takes.

81
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:31,306
(Carmen and Richie laughing)

82
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:37,499
I love you.

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,852
- I love you right back.

84
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,770
(lighter clicking)

85
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,662
- You're late, Lyle,
you're fucking late, man!

86
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:49,169
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

87
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,269
- [Richie] Where's your bike?

88
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,103
- [Lyle] They stole it last night.

89
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,090
- Fucking thieves.

90
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,849
- Hey, it's all right,
listen, Richie, it's fine.

91
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,429
We pull this off we buy 10 bikes.

92
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,773
It's not worth the headache,
all right, it's not worth it.

93
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,429
I fucking loved that bike, man.

94
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,573
- I know you did, man.

95
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:04,253
Watch the feet, watch your feet!

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,690
Let me see the goods.

97
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:11,953
- Huh?

98
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:13,783
- Yeah, it looks righteous to me.

99
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,829
These turkeys aren't gonna
know that it's talcum powder

100
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,489
until they snort it.
- That's right.

101
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,999
- By that time they'll
have the gun six inches

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,833
up their ass.
- That's right, you got it.

103
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,170
You ready, you good?

104
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,004
- I'm good.

105
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:26,440
- Hey, fuck 'em up, all right?

106
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,154
We can do it, let's do it, let's go.

107
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,988
(engine rumbling)

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,023
(upbeat music)

109
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:54,689
- You guys are late, we
thought you weren't coming.

110
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,090
- You got the fucking money?

111
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:59,131
- You got the fucking dope?

112
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,965
- Huh?

113
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,199
- All right.

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,529
(suspenseful music)

115
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,530
The money.

116
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,379
Let me see what's in there.

117
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,183
- Wait, let me taste the dope.

118
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,252
- Show me first, come on, let's go.

119
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:15,670
- Let's just do it, let's go.

120
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,416
- Let's do it.

121
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,869
- Police, freeze!

122
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,252
- What, what?
- Don't move, don't move!

123
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,124
- Hands behind your
head, get out of the car.

124
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,692
- Move, move, move, move!

125
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:34,631
- All right, come on, out of the car.

126
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:38,499
(police siren wailing)

127
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,102
(tires screeching)

128
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:44,530
- They're cops, man, the
fucking dentists are cops!

129
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,539
- It's all right.
- Lyle, we're fucked!

130
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,829
- Look, you guys got nothing,
we didn't do nothing.

131
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,529
Those aren't drugs, it's talcum powder.

132
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,372
- You pointed a gun at me.

133
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,039
I am a police officer.

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,242
Now, don't you think that that
might be slightly illegal?

135
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:58,392
- I really thought you guys were dentists.

136
00:05:58,393 --> 00:05:59,226
You're fucking good.

137
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,275
- You guys are not so good.

138
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:04,829
In fact, you should be ashamed
to call yourself criminals.

139
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,443
- My girlfriend's gonna kill me.

140
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,609
- Excuse me, are you Carmen?

141
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,379
- Yeah, so?

142
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,213
- I'm Kathy.

143
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,789
- You're from the public
defender's office?

144
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,190
- No, I'm Lyle's girlfriend.

145
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,219
- You are Lyle's old lady? (laughing)

146
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,429
- Is there something funny about that?

147
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,430
- Um, you, uh, just don't
look like I thought.

148
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,610
No, you look, you know,
kind of uptown, that's all.

149
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,410
Hey, come on, don't get mad.

150
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,169
How much time you think the boys will get?

151
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,003
- Well, my lawyer says

152
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,149
that Lyle will get one to three years.

153
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,319
What's your lawyer say about Richie?

154
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,349
- I ain't got a lawyer,
I got a public defender.

155
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,239
She's maybe 21 years old.

156
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,549
I ask her how long,

157
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,429
she tells me she don't
like to speculate, asshole.

158
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,879
So, you know, I figured
same crime, same time, no?

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,989
Depending on how bad Lyle's record is.

160
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,639
Richie's got a couple of priors.

161
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,979
- Yeah, Lyle has one prior and some stuff

162
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,969
when he was a juvenile, but
they can't use that against him.

163
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,070
- That's what he told you, just one prior?

164
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Sit.

165
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,029
Where are you from, San Francisco?

166
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,539
- No, LA.

167
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,729
Anyway, that's where I grew up.

168
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,467
Lyle and I just moved
up here about a year go.

169
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:46,891
Get away from all that LA craziness.

170
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:47,892
- Yeah.

171
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,490
- Where are you from?

172
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:53,159
- Same as you, LA, East LA, you?

173
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
- West LA.

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,269
All right, Beverly Hills.

175
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,439
- Hey, we all gotta be from somewhere.

176
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,059
You know, but if you've got money,

177
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,699
why do you let Lyle steal?

178
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,629
He's about as good at it as
my Richie, which is lousy.

179
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,119
- Look, don't let Beverly
Hills fool you, okay?

180
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,699
I don't have any money.

181
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,149
I got the 10,000 to pay the lawyer

182
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,959
by telling my parents I was gonna use it

183
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,060
to get away from Lyle.

184
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,376
My father cried when I
told him how I spent it.

185
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,135
I don't think they're gonna
be giving me any more.

186
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,802
- They're not crazy about Lyle, huh?

187
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:28,139
- No, they don't like his tattoos.

188
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,819
- Well, Carmen, I think it's
fair to say we did good.

189
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,179
Very good.

190
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,089
I made the best deal I
could, three to five.

191
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,149
If he behaves himself,
he's out in 30 months.

192
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,459
- You know, what I figured...

193
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
- How long for Lyle?

194
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,869
- Why don't we talk about this over lunch?

195
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
- How long, Roy?

196
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,029
- What can I tell you?

197
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,399
Lyle's looking at 36 months minimum.

198
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,029
Now, how about lunch?

199
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,519
I'm buying, I can explain
the entire situation to you.

200
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,689
- You feel like a free lunch?

201
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,523
He's buying.

202
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:02,479
- Right, right, you're
both invited, my pleasure.

203
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,880
Double pleasure, definitely.

204
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,379
- Do you know how hard
it is to find $10,000?

205
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,649
And for what?

206
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,589
Lyle got more time than Richie
and Richie only had a PD.

207
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,672
What the hell did you do for $10,000?

208
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:17,799
- Hey, I understand, you're upset.

209
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,089
Your boyfriend was facing a
maximum seven to 10 years.

210
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,119
But I called in a lot of favors.

211
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,113
36 months is a bargain.

212
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,669
You see, Kathy, you don't
understand how these things work.

213
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,209
If you understood, you'd be thanking me.

214
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,109
- Where are they serving their time?

215
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,269
- Only place they had any room

216
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,599
was at Tehachalpi Correction Facility.

217
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,699
- Tehacha what?

218
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,709
Where the hell is that?

219
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,799
- 400, 500 miles south,
down in the desert.

220
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,963
Dry climate, not such a bad place.

221
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,233
Visiting every weekend and holidays.

222
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,629
- Are you crazy?

223
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,699
That's 10 hours by car each way.

224
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,570
- If you got a good car.

225
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,789
Kathy, you got a good car?

226
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,639
- I don't have any car.

227
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,759
- So happens I have a place,
very nice place in Mojave.

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,619
It was given to me by a former client.

229
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,879
Now, I never use it, I never go there.

230
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,529
It's maybe 60 miles from
Tehachalpi Prison, okay, all right?

231
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,629
Is that making it up to you?

232
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,049
- How much is it?

233
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,439
I don't have any money left and
I have no place to get more.

234
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,429
- You think I'm only
interested in your money?

235
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,699
- Oh, is there something else
that you're interested in?

236
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,453
- Let me be honest, Kathy,
perfectly honest, okay?

237
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,630
I'm attracted to you.

238
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,589
I'd love to go out with you, see you.

239
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,519
You know, see you.

240
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,679
- You should fuck him, Kathy.

241
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,159
I mean, he's giving you a
free place near your old man.

242
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,289
That's what you want, right,
to be near your old man?

243
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,349
It's only right that you fuck him.

244
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,009
- You wanna fuck him,
Carmen, you fuck him.

245
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,990
- He ain't my lawyer.

246
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,929
He ain't giving me a free place nowhere.

247
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,909
- Listen, Carmen, you're perfectly welcome

248
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,128
to stay there, too, plenty of space.

249
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,349
- I'm sure there's a law against it.

250
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,919
- There's absolutely no law against it.

251
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,759
- You ever had an AIDS test?

252
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,159
- Yeah, a couple of times, but not lately.

253
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,379
- I had a herpes test once,
and sure enough, I had it.

254
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,323
So I'm not going for that AIDS test.

255
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,349
- Listen, I don't want
you girls to do anything

256
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,959
you don't feel right about.

257
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,569
- Well, we'll still get the
place in the desert, right?

258
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,689
I mean, it doesn't depend
on us screwing you.

259
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,519
- I said the place was
yours, if you want it.

260
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,693
- I want it, you?

261
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,389
- What have I got here that's so great?

262
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,189
A kid two inches from being a gang banger,

263
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,199
a lousy rented joint
in an ugly little town.

264
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,768
With Richie gone, I might
as well go someplace, too.

265
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,352
(upbeat music)

266
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,230
- [Kathy] Pretty country.

267
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,279
Sure is a lot of it.

268
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,113
- [Carmen] Kathy, you sure

269
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:49,020
we weren't supposed to turn off somewhere?

270
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,819
- [Kathy] Have we come to
Jumping Cactus Road yet?

271
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,069
- [Carmen] I didn't see no signs.

272
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,759
Do you think maybe they don't got a sign?

273
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,629
Should I turn here?

274
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,830
- [Kathy] Might as well.

275
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,790
- [Paco] Cows!

276
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,023
- [Kathy] Oh, gross.

277
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,359
What are we gonna do?

278
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,423
- Wait for the cowboy.

279
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,539
(cowboy hooting)

280
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Hey mister!

281
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,929
- Ladies.

282
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,539
- Um, we're looking for, what's the name?

283
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,599
- Um, Jumping Cactus Road.

284
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,433
We can't find it.

285
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:27,699
- Well, you did find it,
this is Jumping Cactus Road.

286
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,439
Whereabouts you wanna go?

287
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,109
- Um, three miles from the mailboxes,

288
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,459
and then we're supposed to
turn right for four miles,

289
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,249
and it's a house with a green roof.

290
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,939
- (laughing) You mean a trailer

291
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,199
with a roof that used to be green.

292
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,669
The dopers' trailer.

293
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,630
- What?

294
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,463
A trailer?

295
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:45,799
- Um, we don't know
nothing about no dopers.

296
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,979
- Roy said a house.

297
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,259
- We just borrowed the place.

298
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
You live around here?

299
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,789
- Oh, that bastard.

300
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,623
- Just over the ridge.

301
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:54,559
- Oh, that's nice.

302
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,158
I thought we were the only
human beings around here.

303
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:00,319
- (laughing) Nah, there's
lots of folks around here.

304
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,663
You just don't always see 'em right away.

305
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,090
(cows mooing)

306
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,340
- Yep, that was a cowboy.

307
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,089
An old cowboy, but a cowboy.

308
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,590
(tense music)

309
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,439
No way!
(Kathy groaning)

310
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,259
- We're lost, right?

311
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,803
- Not a chance, this is the right place.

312
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,146
- I was hoping it wasn't.

313
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,673
- What is this?

314
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,510
- Home.

315
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,866
I know it don't look like much,

316
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,189
but that's because it ain't much.

317
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,949
- Oh, that fucker, Roy.

318
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,329
Excuse me, Paco.

319
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,519
Dammit, I shoulda known.

320
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,513
- Hey, what's the matter with you people?

321
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,939
Mm, we got fresh air,

322
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,619
and no noisy neighbors.

323
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,079
- No neighbors at all.

324
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,529
- Who needs them?

325
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,530
We got free rent.

326
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,220
- Free rent is too
expensive for this dump.

327
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,589
- We do a little cleaning
up, it's gonna be fine.

328
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,875
- If we bomb it, it's
still not gonna be fine.

329
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,063
(mouse squeaking)

330
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,749
(Carmen and Kathy screaming)

331
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,279
- Ay, Dios mio, I got fucking
Princess Di for a roommate.

332
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,139
- It stinks in here.

333
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,323
- And now, we hear from the little prince.

334
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:27,799
- Carmen, I cannot live like this.

335
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,439
- Me neither, come on, let's
just go back to San Jose.

336
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,749
- Get the broom and the mop

337
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,849
and the bucket and the soap

338
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,543
out of the car.

339
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,730
Now.

340
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:48,943
Oh my god.

341
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:53,168
(Kathy coughing)

342
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:57,055
(bird screeching)

343
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,806
(metal clanking)

344
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,359
(Kathy sighing)

345
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,889
- Pretty sure I'm gonna hate it here.

346
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,679
- [Carmen] I need some help
with this couch, you guys.

347
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,729
- Tell your mother that
slavery is against the law

348
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,499
here in America.

349
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,829
- [Carmen] What, am I talking to myself?

350
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,883
Paco, Kathy, get in here.

351
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
- You tell her.

352
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:21,399
- [Kathy] I think I hate
the wide open spaces.

353
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,219
- What's the matter, you miss the malls?

354
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,879
- Right.

355
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,049
If putting me down makes
you feel better, Carmen,

356
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,639
then go right ahead,

357
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,473
but I can't deal with it.

358
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,123
- Let me tell you the truth.

359
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,919
Nothing about you makes me feel better.

360
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,189
I don't think this is gonna work out.

361
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,033
You have been bitching
since we left San Jose.

362
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:44,029
- Oh, tough girl.

363
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,009
Tough girl from the Bajio.

364
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,699
- Yeah, better than a middle class

365
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,559
fucking little bitch from Beverly Hills.

366
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,189
- Don't you call me middle class,

367
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,189
and don't you ever call
me a fucking bitch.

368
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,779
I don't let men talk to me that way,

369
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,309
and I'm certainly not gonna let you.

370
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,143
Fuck you.

371
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:01,143
- Fuck you!

372
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,858
(somber music)

373
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,564
(fly buzzing)

374
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:14,482
(insects chirping)

375
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,309
It's kinda peaceful.

376
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,310
- Yeah.

377
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,063
Well, I'm a city girl.

378
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,749
I like a couple of lampposts around.

379
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,053
Maybe even a little neon.

380
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,510
Oh god, what we do for our men.

381
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,469
- [Paco] One good thing,
they got no schools out here.

382
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,919
- Hey, they got schools in town,

383
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,559
tomorrow I take you, get you all set up.

384
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,919
- [Paco] Shit.

385
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,221
- Watch your mouth, go to sleep.

386
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:42,706
(radio blaring)

387
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,207
(blues music)

388
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:55,188
(Carmen singing in foreign language)

389
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:27,797
(engine rumbling)

390
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,149
- I've never been inside a prison before.

391
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,589
Have you?

392
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,999
- Yeah.

393
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,043
To visit my father.

394
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,590
I was younger than Paco.

395
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,309
- Yeah, you know, I learned
about that in psyche.

396
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,399
It's called the prison cycle syndrome.

397
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,629
See, the father figure goes to prison,

398
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,630
and then the son,

399
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,259
who naturally wants to emulate the father,

400
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,539
or father figure, is subconsciously taught

401
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,309
that prison is a natural
way of a man's life.

402
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,659
So he eventually goes to prison too.

403
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,839
- Shut up.

404
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,332
- Don't get mad at me.

405
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,200
It's a psychological fact of life.

406
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:02,339
I mean, your dad was in jail, right?

407
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,879
Now Richie's in jail,

408
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,129
so according to statistics, Paco will-

409
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,963
- You netter shut your face.

410
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
- Hey, I'm sorry.

411
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,810
Really.

412
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,959
You're probably right, what do I know?

413
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,279
Stuff they teach you in school,

414
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,213
what's it got to do with real life, right?

415
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,231
(Kathy sighing)

416
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,307
Paco isn't Richie's kid, is he?

417
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,343
- He's my kid.

418
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,199
His father was a junkie
shit, mistake of my youth.

419
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,889
But Richie treats Paco good, you know?

420
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,540
Like he was his own son, sort of.

421
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,799
- I am his son, he told me so.

422
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,645
He said I am the son of his heart.

423
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,619
(Carmen laughing)

424
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,379
What the fuck does that mean?

425
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,905
- I tell Richie how you
talk, he'd kick your ass.

426
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,159
- No he wouldn't.

427
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,993
- Oh yeah?

428
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:55,119
You wanna find out?

429
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,326
I'll tell him.

430
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,145
- You don't have to tell him.

431
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,979
(engine rumbling)

432
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,259
- [Guard] Visitors' parking to the right,

433
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
follow the sign.

434
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,864
- [Prison Officer] No whites
allowed, and no bare midriff.

435
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:15,698
- What do you think,

436
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:18,529
the boys are gonna see a
bellybutton and start a riot?

437
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,889
- Look, all I was told was that
I couldn't wear blue jeans.

438
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,509
Nobody said anything to me about white.

439
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,459
- Sorry, you'll have to change.

440
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,729
- Change into what?

441
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,563
What do you think I do,

442
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,009
carry a couple of sets of
clothes around with me?

443
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,123
- Move on, next.

444
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,591
- You're gonna have to
go back to the trailer.

445
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:35,559
- Carmen, that's an hour
and a half each way.

446
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,449
By the time I get back,
visiting hours will be over.

447
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,829
- Honey,

448
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,179
I got an outfit in my car,

449
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,052
just got back from the cleaners.

450
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:42,887
You can borrow it if you want.

451
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:46,129
- Oh, thank you, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.

452
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,143
- Okay, come on.

453
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
- Hurry up.

454
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,585
- Just meet me here, okay?

455
00:19:58,586 --> 00:19:59,586
- Thanks.

456
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,832
(Kathy sighing)

457
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,119
(Carmen laughing)

458
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,119
- Sorry.

459
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,695
- You think it's funny?

460
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,143
I wanted to look nice.

461
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,610
- Tell Lyle you've been dieting.

462
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,163
- [Prison Guard] Coming in.

463
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,293
All right fellas, move on through.

464
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,543
(door clanking)

465
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,543
- I miss you so much.

466
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:31,519
You don't know how much I missed you.

467
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,580
- You know how much I miss you, hmm?

468
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:36,404
- Hmm, you do miss me.

469
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:42,049
- I've been dreaming
about you every night.

470
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,896
You dreaming about me?

471
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:44,730
- Course I do.

472
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,563
- Mm hmm?

473
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:48,094
- I dream about you even
when I'm not asleep.

474
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:49,824
- Where?

475
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:50,658
- I'm not telling.

476
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:52,020
- No, no, tell me, where?

477
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,021
- Well.

478
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,620
- No, no, no, leave it, leave your hand.

479
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,329
- People can see us.

480
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,377
- It don't matter, just so
long as the guard don't see us.

481
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:03,123
- How are things at home with Kathy?

482
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,924
- She's pure white bread.

483
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,589
I mean, she don't mean nothing bad,

484
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,449
but, you know, she doesn't
know shit about shit.

485
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,339
You know, she's scared
of living in the desert?

486
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,193
She's scared of everything.

487
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,365
- You got a job?

488
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,963
You making a living?

489
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:21,853
- I'm still looking.

490
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,399
Not a lot of jobs in these little towns.

491
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,385
- [Paco] We gonna eat now?

492
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:28,343
- Paco.

493
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:31,400
(people chatting)

494
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:32,529
- I would kill for a beer.

495
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:37,530
No, I would kill for one hour
with you alone, I would kill.

496
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:40,440
- Is there some place we could go?

497
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:43,024
(gentle music)

498
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,729
- What you think about the joint?

499
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,999
Bad, huh?

500
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,029
- I don't know how they
can stand it in there.

501
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,330
- They ain't got a choice.

502
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,809
- I just feel so sorry for them, you know?

503
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,703
I never knew what it was like.

504
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,299
- Hey, Paco, sweetheart,

505
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,582
don't you got some homework to do?

506
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,019
- It's boring,

507
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
- What's boring?

508
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,290
- School.

509
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,379
Homework.

510
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,099
This place.

511
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,289
There's nothing to do.

512
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,309
- How do you know it's boring?

513
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,918
You never go no place.

514
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,313
Why don't you take a little
walk like an explorer?

515
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,029
- What am I supposed to explore?

516
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,329
- Well, go find out, huh?

517
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,109
Take a little hike, why don't you?

518
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,879
Don't go too far and come
back before it's dark, huh?

519
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,453
Look, why don't you go
see what's over that hill?

520
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,792
(bird screeching)

521
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,199
If that welfare check
don't come by tomorrow,

522
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,809
we're in trouble.

523
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,643
Big trouble.

524
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:52,999
- Well, I think I've got a job
in a supermarket in Mojave.

525
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,113
They're gonna let me
know for sure next week.

526
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,369
- We ain't gonna last till next week

527
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,803
without that damn check.

528
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,130
(insects chirping)
(bird screeching)

529
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,739
(Sampson roaring)

530
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,725
- Oh god, please don't let him eat me,

531
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,533
please don't let him eat me.
- Hey kid.

532
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,469
What do you think you're doing?

533
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,309
- That's a lion.

534
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,263
- [Frank] You know this
is private property?

535
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,179
- Does he bite?

536
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,050
- Old Sampson?

537
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,342
No.

538
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:25,239
He don't hardly have any teeth left.

539
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,469
But you get him mad and he'll sit on you,

540
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,689
now what are you doing around here?

541
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,650
- Nothing.

542
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:30,619
I just came over the hill.

543
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,770
Where'd you get a lion?

544
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
- I got a tiger too.

545
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,229
(Louie Louie growling)

546
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,230
- He's beautiful.

547
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,050
What's his name?

548
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,050
- Louie Louie.

549
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,722
- So what do you do with him?

550
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:46,569
- I train him, for movies
and TV commercials,

551
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,570
things like that.

552
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,776
You ever see that commercial
where the guy says,

553
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:51,696
"This is my dog, Spot," only it's a lion,

554
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,809
did you ever see that one?

555
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,089
- Yeah, sure.

556
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,090
- That's Sampson.

557
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:58,359
And Louie Louie here, he was
in Sheena: Queen of the Jungle,

558
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,869
that was years ago, you
ever see that movie?

559
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,729
- Does he got any teeth?

560
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,219
- You bet.

561
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,549
Not like old Sampson there.

562
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,169
I gotta cut his meat for him.

563
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,489
Louie Louie's got beautiful teeth though.

564
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,879
And a hell of an appetite.

565
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,009
Eats 40, 50 pounds of meat at a time.

566
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,099
- [Paco] Where'd you get him?

567
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,579
- [Frank] I bought him
off a guy in Hollywood.

568
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,469
- He in the movies now?

569
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,410
- Well, to tell you the truth,

570
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,379
the industry's a little
bit slow right now,

571
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,030
but we got a couple of deals
that might come through.

572
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:28,190
(birds screeching)

573
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:29,570
- [Carmen] Damn!

574
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:31,267
(Carmen sighing)

575
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:32,689
- [Kathy] You got the check?

576
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,560
- No.

577
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:35,839
I got a letter that says
since I moved from San Jose,

578
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,959
they can't send me the welfare

579
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,519
till I tell 'em where I'm living.

580
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,659
- If they had the address
to send you the letter...

581
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,949
- It don't matter, shit!

582
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,059
I gotta do it all over again,

583
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,079
and then I gotta wait another three weeks.

584
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,267
- Now, we need it now!

585
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,519
- You don't got any stash, a
rat hole somewhere do you, hey?

586
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,169
- God, don't I wish.

587
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,920
Carmen, I wouldn't hold out on you.

588
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,710
- Oh.

589
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:00,889
We don't got a can of nothing?

590
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,109
- There's no food, Carmen, no money.

591
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,299
Stop pretending there's a little more,

592
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,689
we're out of everything.

593
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,039
- [Carmen] Nothing, zero?

594
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
- Nada.

595
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,813
- zip?

596
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:12,403
- [Kathy] You got it,
we're wiped out, finished.

597
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,049
- Wrong.

598
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,209
We got a few gallons of gas in the car.

599
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,509
We're not finished, I do not surrender.

600
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,399
I ain't gonna fucking lay down and die.

601
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,703
I got a kid to feed.

602
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Okay.

603
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
I got the answer.

604
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,079
We knock over a 7-Eleven,

605
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,249
there's one in Mojave, what do you say?

606
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,059
- I say you're going crazy.

607
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Or do you think you're gonna be able

608
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:36,699
to share a cell with Richie?

609
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,997
No 7-Elevens.

610
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,249
- Oh god.

611
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,549
Oh, you're right, I am going crazy,

612
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,800
we don't even have a gun.

613
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,353
- All right, what have we got to sell?

614
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,241
- Pussy.

615
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,075
- What?

616
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,149
- What, what?

617
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,819
English your second language?

618
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,419
- I couldn't do that, I'm not a whore.

619
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,059
- Well, I'm not a whore either,

620
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,649
but I'm gonna do it because I
can't think of anything else.

621
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,132
I don't got parents in Beverly Hills,

622
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:01,779
I don't got parents period.

623
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,759
- Don't run me through
that crap again, please.

624
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,609
You know my parents aren't
gonna give me any money.

625
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,509
- Look, I'm gonna do what I have to do.

626
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,293
You can't do it, you don't do it.

627
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,309
- Well, it's not like I think I'm too good

628
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,806
to be a hooker or something.

629
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,507
- You don't gotta explain nothing.

630
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,999
- It's just that I've never
done anything like that before.

631
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
- I understand.

632
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,300
- How much will we charge?

633
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,300
- How much you think we're worth,

634
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:28,943
a couple of beauties like us?

635
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:32,203
- $100, 200.

636
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,539
- In Vegas, maybe, this
is poor man's country.

637
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,526
We charge 30 bucks, settle for 25.

638
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:40,239
- $25?

639
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,853
I am worth much more
than $25, and so are you.

640
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,603
- Let me tell you something
my grandfather used to say.

641
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,489
You know what the most
valuable thing in the world is?

642
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,709
A head of a dead cat.

643
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,570
Why?

644
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:57,479
'Cause you can't put a price on it.

645
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,780
We charge what we can get.

646
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:04,337
(bead curtain rattling)

647
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:08,071
- Where are you going?

648
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:09,752
- We're going to town, we'll be back late.

649
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,363
- Can I come too?

650
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,200
- No.

651
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:14,369
I'm gonna go look for a job, okay?

652
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,943
You stay here and do your
schoolwork, okay sweetheart?

653
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:30,254
(engine rumbling)

654
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:36,961
(tires screeching)

655
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:39,462
(blues music)

656
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,049
Where we going?

657
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,093
- A bar, I guess.

658
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,070
- Bar's risky.

659
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,099
You know, these little towns,
everybody knows everybody,

660
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,469
a working girl wouldn't last long enough

661
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,349
to finish her drink.

662
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,549
I guess we got no choice.

663
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,339
- Well, let's use our heads.

664
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,690
- Well, they probably will.

665
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,421
We're looking for men, right?

666
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:16,422
- Yeah.

667
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,949
I am really lucky to have a
college girl for a partner.

668
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,123
Of course we're looking
for men, Jesus Christ.

669
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:27,449
- Well, where are you gonna
find men in a small town?

670
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,499
- A bar, but like I said-

671
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,713
- No, besides a bar.

672
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,379
- Look, if I wanna play 20 questions,

673
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,317
I would've stayed home with Paco.

674
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:39,189
You got any ideas, or you just
talking 'cause you're scared?

675
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,339
- You never give men any
credit for brains, Carmen.

676
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,629
- Show me some brains and I'll
give you plenty of credit.

677
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,049
You know where to find men?

678
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,050
- Yes, I do.

679
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,829
You want men, here we are.

680
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,851
- You want credit, I give you credit.

681
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:04,852
(car doors banging)

682
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,650
Hello?

683
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,484
Anybody home?

684
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:17,651
- [Jim] Be right with you.

685
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,349
- Where's the firemen?

686
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,083
- Where's the fire?

687
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,774
- This is the firehouse, right?

688
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:31,729
There's supposed to be firemen here.

689
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,769
- It's a volunteer
firehouse, one man on duty.

690
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,413
I got a fire, I call the others.

691
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,919
So you got a fire, ladies?

692
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,893
- We've got something better than a fire.

693
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,200
- Us.

694
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,853
We, we're hot, baby.

695
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,619
We're very, very hot.

696
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,669
- Passionate, you know what I'm saying?

697
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,839
- We're looking for some
action, you interested?

698
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
- Absolutely.

699
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:56,929
- $50.

700
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,989
- For what?

701
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,608
- For the action.

702
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:00,442
What do you think we're doing,

703
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:02,043
selling magazine subscriptions?

704
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,533
- You mean you're hookers?

705
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:08,959
- $30.

706
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,408
- She meant $50.

707
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,849
We're worth 50 bucks.

708
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,336
Well worth it.

709
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:17,449
- I never said you weren't,
but you're putting me on.

710
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,719
You're not hookers.

711
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,809
- Well, not full time, but-

712
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,819
- Kathy, shut up.

713
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,379
Look.

714
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,393
We need money, bad.

715
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:27,829
What do you say?

716
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,899
- I say you're beautiful.

717
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,549
Both of you, you want some coffee?

718
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,199
- We want some money.

719
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,137
- Jesus, you need money that bad?

720
00:30:35,138 --> 00:30:37,269
(Carmen sighing)

721
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,349
- Only if we wanna eat.

722
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,579
- You girls aren't whores.

723
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,749
- What, you wanna see our union cards?

724
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,079
- If you need money,
why don't you get a job?

725
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,239
- You got a job?

726
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,429
- [Jim] I know where you
might be able to get one,

727
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,879
you ever tend bar?

728
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,823
- Yeah, I'm good at it.

729
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,810
- A girl at the Sunset
left this afternoon.

730
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,403
Lemme make a call.

731
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,453
- Hey, thanks.

732
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
You're a nice guy.

733
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:12,388
(car horn honking)

734
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,639
(muzak playing)

735
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,119
You still working?

736
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,239
You're supposed to be off at seven,

737
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,582
I gotta be at the bar by eight.

738
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,139
- I know, I just gotta
finish this one aisle, okay?

739
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,129
- What, he's making you work overtime?

740
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,679
Well, you getting time and a half?

741
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,589
- No, but I do get a choice,

742
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,319
do it or get another job.

743
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,210
I was a little late getting
to work this morning.

744
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:35,089
- Hey man, check it out.

745
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,090
That girl.

746
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:38,913
That's what I call a lousy thief.

747
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,500
When I used to do this, oh shit.

748
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,759
- We prosecute shoplifters here.

749
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,218
Marcia, call the police,
I've got a shoplifter.

750
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,453
- Shit, she's busted.

751
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,513
What the fuck?

752
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,669
She's having a fit, quick, help!

753
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,833
Help, help, help me!

754
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,105
Come on.

755
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,100
Oh, it's real bad.

756
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:07,758
Oh my god.

757
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,249
- My cousin gets these
epileptic episodes too.

758
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,299
(Kathy sighing)

759
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,999
Are you feeling better?

760
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,629
- Yeah, I'm fine now.

761
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,331
I'll just finish stocking this shelf.

762
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:19,165
- Oh, no!
- No, no, no,

763
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,499
no, no, forget about the shelves.

764
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,183
Just go home, rest.

765
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,529
- Thank you.

766
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,079
I saw it in a movie.

767
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,029
- Princess, I don't know,
sometimes you got cojones.

768
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,262
- Seemed like the right thing to do.

769
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,846
(gentle music)

770
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:52,736
- [Carmen] Woo! (laughing)

771
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,577
(relaxed music)

772
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,304
- So how's it going?

773
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:14,289
- You know, I thanked you a million times,

774
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,483
but thanks again.

775
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,940
You saved my butt.

776
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,589
- I'm glad I was able to help.

777
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,176
Your butt's worth saving.

778
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,259
(Carmen laughing)

779
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,160
You look real nice tonight,

780
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,560
you don't mind my saying so.

781
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,893
- Why should I mind?

782
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,243
You say I look like a dog, that I mind.

783
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:39,413
- There's no way you could
ever look like a dog.

784
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,250
Would you like to dance?

785
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:51,334
♪ For such sweet loving ♪

786
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,190

787
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,336

790
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:20,209
- Come on, you're gonna
miss the school bus.

791
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,239
- Good, I hate that school.

792
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,366
- I don't remember any
school that you loved.

793
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,199
- Yeah, but this one I hate the most,

794
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,829
the teacher thinks I'm stupid.

795
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,329
- You're not stupid.

796
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,869
You don't read so good
yet, but you're not stupid.

797
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,703
- I don't care.

798
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:32,499
Frank don't read so good,
and he ain't stupid.

799
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,333
- Get in the car.

800
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,359
Frank, who's Frank?

801
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,979
- I told you 1,000 times, Frank is-

802
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,090
- Oh please, get in the car, we're late.

803
00:34:46,113 --> 00:34:48,378
(engine rumbling)

804
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,962
(upbeat music)

805
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,155
(tires screeching)

806
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:01,989
(singing in foreign language)

807
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:21,369
I'll wait with you.

808
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,709
- [Paco] No, it's embarrassing.

809
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,239
- [Carmen] Hey, come here.

810
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,073
(Carmen kissing)

811
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:26,273
- [Paco] Get outta here.

812
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:35,261
- Paco, you're not stupid.

813
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,090
- Go on, get going.

814
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:42,490
(engine rumbling)

815
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:09,390
(singing in foreign language)

816
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,819
- [Kathy] Get him on the bus?

817
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,101
- Yeah.

818
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,403
You know what he told me?

819
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:30,609
That his teacher thinks he's stupid.

820
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,389
I bet the bitch says
that 'cause he's Mexican.

821
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,869
- Come on, you always think
it's some sort of racist thing.

822
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,399
There are other Mexican
kids in his school,

823
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,439
he told me so.

824
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,179
- Yeah, three or four fruit pickers.

825
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,208
Kids she probably thinks
are all stupid too.

826
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:43,207
- Oh, jeez.

827
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,807
- [Carmen] Any more coffee left?

828
00:36:46,408 --> 00:36:48,991
(upbeat music)

829
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,770
- Oh Jesus.

830
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,579
I miss Lyle.

831
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
- Yeah.

832
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,823
I miss Richie too.

833
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,089
You know what?

834
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,940
I kinda like the idea of missing him.

835
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,463
- It is romantic.

836
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,467
Sometimes, I really miss him, you know?

837
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:13,617
It hurts.

838
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:18,923
- You know, Lyle's not
the only guy in the world.

839
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,810
- He is to me.

840
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,470
Nobody knows me the way he does.

841
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:29,750
He looks in my eyes, I know he
sees the me inside, you know?

842
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,361
I've never had that with anybody else.

843
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:34,459
I think we must've been lovers

844
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,679
in another lifetime, you know?

845
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,709
- Another lifetime, you believe that shit?

846
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,710
- Don't you?

847
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,363
You know, when Lyle
would come to pick me up,

848
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,999
my dad would lock all the doors

849
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,069
and I'd have to climb
out the bedroom window.

850
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,586
One time, my dad said to me,

851
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:54,223
"Kathy, if you go with
him, we won't know you.

852
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:57,167
You won't be our daughter anymore."

853
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,807
So I left with him.

854
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,145
That was it, there was never any question.

855
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,473
- That's so romantic.

856
00:38:07,848 --> 00:38:11,583
I don't know whether to
cry or puke. (laughing)

857
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,759
- Hi, how you doing, Frank?

858
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
- Hey, Paco.

859
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,899
- I didn't have to go to school today,

860
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,639
so I decided to come and give you a hand.

861
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,140
How's Sampson and Louie Louie?

862
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,169
(Sampson growling)

863
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,829
What's the matter with him?

864
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,369
- He's hungry.

865
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,359
He and Louie Louie haven't
eaten in a couple of days.

866
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,910
- So are we gonna feed him now?

867
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,950
- Feed him with what?

868
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,369
You think all I gotta do is open up

869
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,820
a couple of cans of cat food?

870
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,119
I told you, these guys eat 30, 40 pounds

871
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,629
of red meat at a time.

872
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,549
- So then what are we gonna do?

873
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,739
You know, about feeding 'em?

874
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,719
- Hey, did I tell you?

875
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,319
We might have a new TV series.

876
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,351
Yeah, I'm waiting to hear
from a guy I know in LA.

877
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:55,799
(Sampson growling)

878
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,269
(Frank sighing)

879
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,889
- [Kathy] Dressing up, are we?

880
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,395
What's the occasion?

881
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:03,719
- Hm?

882
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,369
- [Kathy] I need the car, I've
gotta be at work by three.

883
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,223
- I'm not taking the car.

884
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,403
- Somebody's picking you up?

885
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:12,019
- Hm.

886
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,149
- Are you gonna answer my question,

887
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,759
or are you just gonna keep hmm-ing at me?

888
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,569
Where are you going?

889
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,703
- A friend is coming by, no big deal.

890
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,089
He wants to show me something.

891
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,639
Don't ask me what, 'cause
I don't know what it is.

892
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,643
- You've got a date?

893
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,783
- What are you talking about, a date?

894
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,573
Jim's coming by, if you
gotta know everything.

895
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,799
Mother of god, it's my day off.

896
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,153
- [Kathy] I was just asking, pardon me.

897
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,622
- You think it's wrong,
me going out with him?

898
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:46,579
- I don't know anything.

899
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,823
Gonna tell Richie?

900
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:50,783
- I might, I might not.

901
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,569
Listen.

902
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,009
Richie's gonna be locked
up for two years plus.

903
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,714
What am I supposed to
do, become my mother?

904
00:39:58,715 --> 00:40:00,979
- Ah, you do what's right for you.

905
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,130
Gonna make it with him?

906
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,023
- What?

907
00:40:06,024 --> 00:40:07,133
Make it with who?

908
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,049
How do I know?

909
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,050
No.

910
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:13,223
I might.

911
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,363
If I want to, I will.

912
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,979
Why, do you think I shouldn't?

913
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,939
- Well, I wouldn't do that to Lyle.

914
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,619
- But you were ready to
fuck a bunch of firemen

915
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,199
a couple of weeks ago.

916
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,939
- That was entirely
different and you know it.

917
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,759
- Okay, suppose that it
was the other way around,

918
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,509
and you were in jail,

919
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,429
you don't think Lyle would
be stepping out on you?

920
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,883
Tell the truth.

921
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:41,719
- He might I guess.

922
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,570
- You guess?

923
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:44,629
- I don't know, god.

924
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,125
Look, all I'm saying is
that what's right for me

925
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:49,376
might not be right for you.

926
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,719
- Why do you live way out
here with the rattlesnakes?

927
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,393
A cool guy like you.

928
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,999
- I don't like it in the cities anymore.

929
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,889
I used to be a real firefighter.

930
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,032
I worked out in Newark for
12 years, and loved it.

931
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:19,383
I was saving people's
lives, I was no big hero,

932
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,633
but I felt like I was
doing something worthwhile.

933
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:25,491
- So what changed your mind?

934
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,809
- Ran into one too many burning tenements

935
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,569
that had been set on
fire for the insurance.

936
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,869
- So stupid.

937
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,870
- Tell me about it.

938
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,490
I finally had to come out here

939
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:37,940
to get a breath of clean air.

940
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:53,284
(Barney whistling)

941
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,659
Hey, Barney.

942
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,660
- Hi, Jim.

943
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:00,284
- Want a ride?

944
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,117
We're heading home.

945
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,439
- [Barney] No, thank you kindly anyway.

946
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,047
- Find anything?

947
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:07,149
- There's nothing out here to find, kid.

948
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,439
- I've been telling you
that for years, Barney,

949
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,909
but I believe you know better.

950
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,099
Got a gold mine out here
somewhere, don't you?

951
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,699
- There's no gold out here.

952
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,439
All there is is a bunch
of nosy folks like you

953
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,280
spying on a man.

954
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:18,729
- Well, you take care, Barney,

955
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,799
and watch out for them spies.

956
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,600
- [Barney] Spying on a man,
that's all that's out there.

957
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,427
(Barney whistling)

958
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:37,839
(Carmen laughing)

959
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,119
- [Jim] Pretty nice, right?

960
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,553
- [Carmen] It's weird.

961
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:41,722
What the hell is it?

962
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:42,973
- [Jim] It's a movie set.

963
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,099
Desert's full of 'em.

964
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,279
I found it a couple of years ago,

965
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,019
they left everything, even the trailers,

966
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,089
and they're so nice, I moved into one.

967
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,536
- [Carmen] You're the
sheriff here, stranger?

968
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,209
- And the mayor,

969
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,749
and the bartender,

970
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,300
and everyone else, little lady.

971
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,169
Welcome to Rattlesnake
Jim's paradise by the sea.

972
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,392
(saloon door creaking)

973
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:04,439
- Ah, what sea?

974
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,929
This is a desert.

975
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,093
- So that's why the swimming is so lousy.

976
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:18,450
(gentle music)

977
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:26,935
(Carmen sighing)

978
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:30,169
(water bubbling)

979
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,770
How long is your old man in for?

980
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:35,543
- Two and a half, if he don't fuck up.

981
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,533
You ever been in the joint?

982
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,519
(Jim laughing)

983
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,209
- I woke up in the drunk
tank a couple of times,

984
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,253
but nothing serious.

985
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
You?

986
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,239
- Yeah.

987
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Juvenile.

988
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,623
Was a long time ago.

989
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,470
- For what?

990
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,259
- Chicken shit stuff. (laughing)

991
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,569
Then I got knocked up with Paco,

992
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,620
and that was the end of my life in crime.

993
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:07,419
(engines revving)

994
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
What can I tell you?

995
00:44:09,403 --> 00:44:10,890
I don't like jail.

996
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:13,184
- Oh no.

997
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:16,240
Oh no, no, no!

998
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:18,431
- What?

999
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,874
(engines revving)

1000
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:21,875
- ATVs.

1001
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,119
Let 'em crash, let 'em burn,
let 'em explode, dammit.

1002
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,563
- What are ATs or whatever?

1003
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,709
- All fucking terrain vehicles.

1004
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,179
They're tricycles with fat rubber tires

1005
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,319
and motors and fat people
ride 'em all over the desert.

1006
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,099
They ride 'em in places
where not a human being

1007
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,739
has stepped in a million years.

1008
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,784
God, I hate 'em, I hate
'em so goddamn much.

1009
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:45,589
- Yeah, I get that feeling.

1010
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,718
Why are they visiting us?

1011
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,969
- They're canny old people.

1012
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:55,199
- How you doing?

1013
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,693
That's a hot spring, Billy.

1014
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,699
- It's a gift from God.

1015
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,249
- Yeah, we're church-going
people ourselves.

1016
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,550
- And what church is that?

1017
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,787
(woman gasping)

1018
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:06,621
(Billy laughing)

1019
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,049
- Hey, cover yourself, can't
you see there's a kid here?

1020
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,239
- Can't you see there's people here?

1021
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,159
Haven't you ever heard
of the word privacy?

1022
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,410
- You're a freak, mister.

1023
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,614
Have a good time.

1024
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:18,581
Unfriendly assholes!

1025
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,415
(engines revving)

1026
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,143
(somber music)

1027
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:41,492
- It used to be a magic place.

1028
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,820
Now, they're gonna destroy it.

1029
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,543
Every place they go, they destroy.

1030
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:52,868
And they go fucking everywhere.

1031
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,233
- You should build a
wall around this place.

1032
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:02,433
Don't let those people bring you down.

1033
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:09,951
Just let it go.

1034
00:46:20,248 --> 00:46:22,581
- We gonna do it right here?

1035
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,653
- [Lyle] So, you seeing anybody?

1036
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:32,696
- Lyle, you keep asking me that,

1037
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:34,789
and I keep telling you I love you.

1038
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,340
I don't go out with other guys.

1039
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,202
(inmates chatting)

1040
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:40,536
- I believe you.

1041
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:44,039
You shouldn't even be out
here in the first place,

1042
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,565
living in some grungy trailer

1043
00:46:45,566 --> 00:46:47,209
in the middle of the
fucking desert, you know?

1044
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,013
You should be back in Beverly
Hills with your people.

1045
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,569
- Look, I'm not the one
who got you busted, Lyle.

1046
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,236
You did that, and you're
taking it out on me.

1047
00:46:56,237 --> 00:46:57,070
- I'm not listening to this shit.

1048
00:46:57,071 --> 00:46:59,209
- Well, you'd better listen to it.

1049
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,503
You screwed it up.

1050
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,120
Jesus, do you think this
is how I wanna be with you?

1051
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,288
In this place?

1052
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,523
Do you think that's my idea of love?

1053
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,119
- Look, I just want you to go, okay?

1054
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
- No.

1055
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,517
- I really think you should go.

1056
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:27,518
- No.

1057
00:47:30,374 --> 00:47:32,957
(Lyle sighing)

1058
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:38,705
(Kathy sighing)

1059
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,419
- Every weekend, I wake up
with knots in my stomach,

1060
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,020
afraid you're not gonna show up.

1061
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,833
I just can't believe my luck.

1062
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:55,163
A fuck up like me.

1063
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:57,326
And I have you.

1064
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:02,722
I'm just scared I'm dreaming it all,

1065
00:48:02,723 --> 00:48:03,873
and it's gonna go away.

1066
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,770
I love you.

1067
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:09,745
- I know.

1068
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,759
- What'd your mom's boyfriend do?

1069
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,373
- The cops set him up,
but he shot his way out.

1070
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,978
Almost.

1071
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,549
- Kill anyone?

1072
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,139
- Couple of cops.

1073
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,240
Not killed 'em, you know, but shot 'em up.

1074
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:34,007
(baby crying)

1075
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,423
- Keep it decent.

1076
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,130
- Let's go for a walk.

1077
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,461
- Your job okay?

1078
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:51,219
I mean, you got enough money and stuff?

1079
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,220
- We get by.

1080
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,149
- Well, when I get outta here,

1081
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,110
it's gonna be a different story,

1082
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:56,410
you can count on it, baby.

1083
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,799
What, you don't believe me?

1084
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,950
- I always believe you.

1085
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:04,693
I have to believe you.

1086
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,049
I don't want to be visiting
Paco in here 10 years from now.

1087
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,439
- What are you talking
about Paco in the joint for?

1088
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,410
He's a good kid.

1089
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:13,060
- It's got nothing to do with it.

1090
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,123
There's this prison psycho
syndrome thing, you know?

1091
00:49:20,873 --> 00:49:22,909
The father figure's a con,

1092
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,093
the kid becomes a con.

1093
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,853
Like, following in his footsteps.

1094
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,610
Do you know what I'm saying?

1095
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:29,443
- Well, what I'm saying is,

1096
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:32,053
when I get outta here, I'm
never coming back, Carmen.

1097
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,799
It's a straight job is
all I'm interested in.

1098
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,076
A family, with you and Paco,

1099
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:41,793
and a straight fucking lunch bucket job.

1100
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,940
And this time, it's different.

1101
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,380
- You're right.

1102
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:50,181
It is different.

1103
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:53,603
You're gonna make it this time.

1104
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,815
I do believe you.

1105
00:49:56,816 --> 00:49:58,016
- You're the best, baby.

1106
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,889
You know, I can see
right through your eyes,

1107
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,597
straight to your heart.

1108
00:50:04,598 --> 00:50:05,598
- What do you see?

1109
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
- I see

1110
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,743
a great orange ball of fire.

1111
00:50:12,918 --> 00:50:15,461
(soft music)

1112
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:17,653
I'm blinded by the light, it's so bright,

1113
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,510
and so hot.

1114
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:26,346
- I've never, ever loved a
man more than I love you.

1115
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,640
Do it to me, Richie.

1116
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,010
Right across this table.

1117
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,947
Look into my eyes and do it to me.

1118
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,142
- Oh god, I'm doing it to you.

1119
00:50:42,143 --> 00:50:44,143
- I know, I can feel it.

1120
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,083
- Oh god.

1121
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:53,072
(Carmen and Richie sighing)

1122
00:50:53,073 --> 00:50:55,352
(Richie laughing)

1123
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:59,103
(Richie and Carmen laughing)

1124
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,273
(Richie groaning)

1125
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:09,543
Oh.

1126
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:12,415
You got a cigarette.

1127
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,353
(gentle music)

1128
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:42,359
- [Police Guard] All right
people, come on, cool off.

1129
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,673
Let's go, break it up.

1130
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:49,969
(music intensifying)

1131
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,970
Lyle.

1132
00:51:52,114 --> 00:51:55,389
What's the matter, you don't hear so good?

1133
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,929
Let's go, move out.

1134
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,630
Put your clothes back on, sweetie.

1135
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:07,012
(people chatting)

1136
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,699
(bird screeching)

1137
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,429
- Can I ask you a question?

1138
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,839
- What?

1139
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,863
- Did you tell Richie that
you went out with Jim?

1140
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,650
- I started to and then I changed my mind.

1141
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,719
- You know, Lyle doesn't believe me

1142
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,389
when I tell him I don't
go out with other guys.

1143
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,340
Does Richie ever get on you about that?

1144
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,283
- Richie doesn't ask me about
those things, he's not stupid.

1145
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:40,549
Well, he's a little stupid,
but he's not that stupid.

1146
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,719
And it's a good thing, because, you know,

1147
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,969
you can't tell a guy shit.

1148
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,579
He don't believe you no
matter what they say.

1149
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,009
Show up with your pussy sewn shut,

1150
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,969
they still don't believe
you ain't screwing somebody.

1151
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,273
Kathy, it's Lyle's problem, not yours.

1152
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,889
- I wish I could be the way you are.

1153
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,456
- [Carmen] What way is that?

1154
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:00,929
- Just the way you accept life,

1155
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,949
and all the shitty things that happen.

1156
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,359
You don't let it bother you.

1157
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,363
- How the hell do you
know what bothers me?

1158
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:12,869
(coyote howling)

1159
00:53:13,947 --> 00:53:16,780
(engine rumbling)

1160
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,131
- What the hell is this?

1161
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:29,479
Where the fuck is the trailer?

1162
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,133
- Two IRS men dropped by and towed it.

1163
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,170
We're evicted.

1164
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:37,499
Refers to your lawyer, Roy Strap,

1165
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,053
he forgot to pay his taxes.

1166
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,832
- Evicted, but they can't do that,

1167
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,879
I mean, we live here, this is our home.

1168
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,319
- Yeah, that's exactly what I told 'em,

1169
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,409
but you know what?

1170
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,110
They went ahead and did it anyway.

1171
00:53:49,382 --> 00:53:50,382
- Shit.

1172
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,313
- I cried when they drove
away like a little baby.

1173
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,420
I haven't done that in years.

1174
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,539
When we got here, it was
a dump and we hated it,

1175
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,640
let's just find another dump that we hate.

1176
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:12,399
- Oh god, Paco's gonna be so upset.

1177
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,239
This is not fair, Carmen,
this is not fucking fair.

1178
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,100
- Fair, you expect fair?

1179
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:18,083
Where've you been all your life?

1180
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:21,271
Hey, come on.

1181
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,420
Let's saddle up.

1182
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,950
It's time to move on.

1183
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:28,534
(upbeat music)

1184
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:38,153
(saw scraping)

1185
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:53,732
We came to live with you.

1186
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:54,733
That okay?

1187
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:57,323
- Absolutely.

1188
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,357
(birds singing)

1189
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:08,240
(Carmen screaming)

1190
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:09,539
- Oh my god.

1191
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,438
- It's all right, it's only a king snake.

1192
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:14,489
- It's not all right, it's
a fucking snake, Kathy.

1193
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,099
- I've been reading about
the animals up here.

1194
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,099
This is a king snake, he doesn't bite,

1195
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,179
he won't hurt you, look.

1196
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,599
- It doesn't have to bite me to hurt me,

1197
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,259
he could kill me with a heart attack.

1198
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,079
- Come on, he's more afraid
of us than we are of him.

1199
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,195
- You speak for yourself,

1200
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:31,046
and you keep that thing away from me.

1201
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,999
- Kinda neat, you know?

1202
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,459
They're not slimy like you think.

1203
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
- That's sick.

1204
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,449
- They're dry and smooth.

1205
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,536
Feel sorta sensual, you know?

1206
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:46,529
- You need to get laid right away.

1207
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,193
- Yeah, I do miss Lyle, a lot.

1208
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:52,499
- Don't gotta tell me that.

1209
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,223
You just picked up a snake
and took it for a walk.

1210
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:59,679
Remember when we first got here?

1211
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,730
A little mouse sent you through the roof.

1212
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:05,063
Now you're like this
nature girl or something.

1213
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,523
- Will you give me your honest
opinion about something?

1214
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:12,729
- I don't know.

1215
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:13,730
- It's about Lyle.

1216
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:17,664
You know, I keep trying to
imagine my life without him.

1217
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,580
Three years of not waking up next to him.

1218
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,633
Three years before he kisses my breasts.

1219
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,920
Keep trying to imagine it and I can't.

1220
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,869
So I think I've figured
out a way to cool him out.

1221
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,393
You know, about me going out
with other guys and stuff.

1222
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:34,744
You know what I'm gonna do?

1223
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:36,970
- No, tell me.

1224
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,290
- I'm gonna marry him.

1225
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,650
You think I'm crazy?

1226
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
- What do I know?

1227
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:52,441
(gentle music)

1228
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:59,596
(man whistling)

1229
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:09,935
♪ If it wasn't for you ♪

1230
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:13,006
♪ Where would I be ♪

1231
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:14,829
♪ If it wasn't for you ♪

1232
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,169
- Dearly beloved, we're gathered together

1233
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,006
to join Kathy and Lyle

1234
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:20,579
in the bonds of matrimony.
- Where did he get the suit?

1235
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,021
- I gave his regards to
that busted guy over there.

1236
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:27,390
- It fits so beautiful,
like it was made for him.

1237
00:57:27,391 --> 00:57:29,669
- [Chaplain] Whose soul
is purified by their love,

1238
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:32,099
transcend all corporal barriers

1239
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,699
and fly free to that
non-judgemental heaven,

1240
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,629
where true love acknowledges no prison.

1241
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:41,433
True love, the key that opens all doors,

1242
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,813
dissolves all bars.

1243
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:52,401
♪ We'll make a new start ♪

1244
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,652
♪ Thank my lucky stars ♪

1245
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,267
(people applauding)

1246
00:57:58,268 --> 00:58:00,101
- [Carmen] Kiss, kiss!

1247
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:04,016
(gentle music)

1248
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,329
- That's our honeymoon suite.

1249
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,289
I asked one of them married guys about it,

1250
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,849
he says it's just like
a regular apartment.

1251
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,509
You got a living room, a bathroom,

1252
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:26,439
bedroom, kitchen, microwave,
and a regular stove.

1253
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,793
Color TV, no cable.

1254
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,519
- I don't think we're gonna be
watching a lot of TV, are we?

1255
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,863
- I sincerely doubt it.

1256
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,589
- They've let me bring in 10 condoms.

1257
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,029
That's the most you can bring
in for a conjugal visit.

1258
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,823
It's kind of a dirty word, condom.

1259
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,330
- Gets me hot.

1260
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,003
- When can we get in there?

1261
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:51,689
- Hey, I know my name's on that list, sir,

1262
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,309
I put my name on that list.

1263
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,143
- It's not there.

1264
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:55,539
- Well, would you look again please?

1265
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,159
Sir, the rules say if you get married,

1266
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,179
you're entitled to regular married visits,

1267
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,496
that's regular 72 hour
married visits, okay?

1268
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,229
You wanna take a look
at it for yourself, huh?

1269
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,999
- I know the rules, son.

1270
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,593
Thank you kindly all the same.

1271
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,649
- We were just married.

1272
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,419
You know that, warden, you
kissed me after the ceremony.

1273
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,253
We're entitled to some-

1274
00:59:15,254 --> 00:59:18,979
- To 72 hour visiting privileges.

1275
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,399
The use of one unit of conjugal quarters

1276
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,439
on an as available basis.

1277
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,559
That means when we got an empty unit.

1278
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,709
There's a list, son, you
gotta wait your turn,

1279
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,179
that's all I'm saying.

1280
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,839
I'd have thought you'd know that.

1281
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,939
- I put my name on your goddamn list.

1282
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,143
- Subject to availability.

1283
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,192
- We were just married.

1284
00:59:38,193 --> 00:59:41,979
- I know, don't seem
fair, but there it is.

1285
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,989
Now, I can't do anything this weekend,

1286
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,519
of course, everything's all filled up,

1287
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,520
but I'm gonna put you down for the 28th,

1288
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,169
the weekend of the 28th, that's June 28th.

1289
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,006
- June 28th, that's three,

1290
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,363
that's four goddamn weeks
from now, that's four weeks!

1291
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,053
- It's the best I can do, Lyle.

1292
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,576
- It's gonna be okay, you hear me?

1293
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:09,160
We'll be all right.

1294
01:00:10,098 --> 01:00:11,777
- We'll get up, too, honey.

1295
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,754
We'll make it up to each other.

1296
01:00:13,755 --> 01:00:15,069
- Bye.

1297
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,070
- Bye.

1298
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:21,558
(somber music)

1299
01:00:26,594 --> 01:00:28,367
(gentle music)
Bye.

1300
01:00:28,368 --> 01:00:31,333
- Opening door, convict coming through.

1301
01:00:31,334 --> 01:00:32,894
- I love you too.

1302
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,978
- Come on, let's move it.

1303
01:00:40,535 --> 01:00:41,977
Closing the door.

1304
01:00:41,978 --> 01:00:43,253
(door clanking)

1305
01:00:43,254 --> 01:00:44,254
Locking up.

1306
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:48,351
(slide guitar music)

1307
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:58,529
- What's the matter, you can't sleep?

1308
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,530
- I'm married.

1309
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:02,883
- How about that?

1310
01:01:02,884 --> 01:01:04,093
Congratulations.

1311
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:15,738
(people speaking in foreign language)

1312
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:20,503
(convicts chatting)

1313
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:25,138
(door banging)

1314
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,230
- Hey Lyle.

1315
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,740
You and your fist enjoying your honeymoon?

1316
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,243
Ah, feel bad?

1317
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,253
Think how bad your bride must feel, huh?

1318
01:01:43,254 --> 01:01:44,809
You know, I get off work in an hour,

1319
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,219
you want me to pay her a visit,

1320
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,473
do the honors for you?

1321
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,649
- Fuck off.

1322
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,029
- Don't you tell me to fuck off,

1323
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,223
I'll put you on report.

1324
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,783
Just offering you a favor.

1325
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,469
Now, you ain't doing her no good in here.

1326
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,423
She looked real hot to me.

1327
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,410
I could cool her off for you.

1328
01:02:05,193 --> 01:02:07,629
- You're too fat and too
old to cool anything down.

1329
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,080
My girl wouldn't look at you.

1330
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,999
- You know, I'd think
she'd like me just fine.

1331
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,653
Any girl marries an asshole
like you ain't picky.

1332
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,893
I'll go real slow, make it last.

1333
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:21,067
- I kill you!

1334
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:22,629
I'll rip your balls out!

1335
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:25,483
You go near here, I'll kill you!

1336
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:27,726
(men shouting)

1337
01:02:27,727 --> 01:02:28,894
I'll kill you!

1338
01:02:31,558 --> 01:02:32,850
You stay away!

1339
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:36,059
You stay away from her,
I'll kill you, you hear me?

1340
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,448
- [Guard] How do you like this?

1341
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:40,712
(Lyle screaming)

1342
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:43,125
(somber music)

1343
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,626
(cows mooing)

1344
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,580
(gun banging)

1345
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:09,752
(gun banging)

1346
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:14,617
(winch whirring)

1347
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:21,261
(hatchet banging)

1348
01:03:23,235 --> 01:03:24,602
(saw scraping)

1349
01:03:24,603 --> 01:03:26,539
- All right, stretch the leg out there,

1350
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,290
as far as it goes, yeah, that's it.

1351
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:32,298
(Paco groaning)

1352
01:03:33,482 --> 01:03:36,315
(engine rumbling)

1353
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:40,805
- [Paco] Who's that?

1354
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,130
- Take off, boy.

1355
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Now!

1356
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:59,449
Something I can do for you?

1357
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,853
- I believe you know the
answer to that, mister.

1358
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,229
Those are my cows you're
butchering over there.

1359
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:09,379
- Well, I don't think you
can prove a goddamn thing.

1360
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,579
And you're on private property right now.

1361
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,089
My private property.

1362
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,513
- My cows.

1363
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,579
Wearing my brand, and don't be telling me

1364
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,249
what I can prove, I saw you shoot 'em!

1365
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,252
- The day you put the law on me

1366
01:04:22,253 --> 01:04:24,929
will be the sorriest
day you ever saw dawn,

1367
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,279
and I'm not gonna tell you again,

1368
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,839
you are trespassing.

1369
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,529
- I never said nothing
about going to no law.

1370
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,973
I settle my own disputes.

1371
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,979
Now, I'm taking those carcasses back.

1372
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,479
- You try it, and you're
gonna be as dead as that meat.

1373
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,530
My cats are starving.

1374
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
Leave off.

1375
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:08,709
Old man, put the gun away,

1376
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,909
I'm giving you fair warning.

1377
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,579
- I don't scare.

1378
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,859
(gun clicking)

1379
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:15,848
- Neither do I.

1380
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:17,179
(gun clicking)

1381
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,680
(gun banging)

1382
01:05:27,098 --> 01:05:30,015
(gunshots banging)

1383
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:49,706
(old man groaning)

1384
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,059
(tense music)

1385
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,633
Oh Jesus, what did I do now?

1386
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,393
It was self-defense.

1387
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,149
Law of the jungle, I had no choice.

1388
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,169
- We'd better hide his body.

1389
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,570
- No, leave him where he is.

1390
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,183
- You'll go to jail.

1391
01:06:21,066 --> 01:06:23,099
- If they find me, maybe.

1392
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,050
There's still some places a man can go.

1393
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,979
You be smart, kid, you
didn't see any of this.

1394
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,269
You were on your way home,

1395
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,039
and you heard the shooting,

1396
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,743
and it's all you know, all right?

1397
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,200
- I won't rat on you, Frank.

1398
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,310
- Never thought you would.

1399
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,833
(sultry music)

1400
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,620
- What happened?

1401
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:51,842
Are you okay, did you break anything?

1402
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:53,889
He's in shock, are you in shock?

1403
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,243
Ay, Dios mio.
- Oh my god.

1404
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:56,729
- Where is all this blood coming from?

1405
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,225
- Make him lie down, I'm
gonna get the bandages.

1406
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,848
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1407
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,599
It ain't my blood, we
butchered a couple of cows

1408
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,149
for Sampson and Louie Louie.

1409
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,129
- You were playing with lions,

1410
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:08,104
when you're supposed to be in school?

1411
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:09,369
(slap thudding)
- Ow.

1412
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:10,919
- The man from the school came here today,

1413
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,239
he told me that you know you're
not getting to high school.

1414
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,512
You missed too many days, they're
not going to graduate you.

1415
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:18,961
(slaps banging)
- Ow, ow, ow.

1416
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:20,426
- You're bad.

1417
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:22,559
Don't you put your hands on me.

1418
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,269
This is not your child.

1419
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:25,609
- Jesus, Carmen, you're gonna hurt him.

1420
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,009
- Don't you tell me
what to do with my kid.

1421
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,889
You're supposed to go to school.

1422
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,584
You wanna end up in jail
like the rest of the dummies?

1423
01:07:32,585 --> 01:07:34,081
- Richie ain't a dummy!

1424
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:37,629
- Richie is the dummiest of the dummies!

1425
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,027
- Stop it Carmen, Jesus!

1426
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,202
- Who are you?

1427
01:07:41,203 --> 01:07:42,999
Is that your kid?

1428
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,949
You got something to say?

1429
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,713
He don't go to school, he lies to me.

1430
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,819
- Let him go.

1431
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,780
He's just scared.

1432
01:07:50,781 --> 01:07:52,399
- He's got plenty to be scared of.

1433
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,019
And what are you standing in my way for?

1434
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,599
Stay out of my family.

1435
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,656
- But I'm your family too, Carmen.

1436
01:07:59,657 --> 01:08:01,466
- You're what?

1437
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:02,467
My family?

1438
01:08:03,362 --> 01:08:05,029
What, are you crazy?

1439
01:08:08,223 --> 01:08:10,890
(Carmen crying)

1440
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,738
What am I gonna do?

1441
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:19,406
He wasn't listening to me no more.

1442
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:22,074
(Carmen crying)

1443
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:42,125
(gentle music)

1444
01:08:59,906 --> 01:09:02,823
(Barney whistling)

1445
01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:11,655
(birds screeching)

1446
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,509
- If there's someone out there,

1447
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:25,093
I'm warning you, I'm armed.

1448
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,339
And I will shoot any son of a bitch

1449
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,763
who tries to follow me.

1450
01:09:38,145 --> 01:09:40,339
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do about Paco.

1451
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,679
You know, no school?

1452
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,649
He's gonna be running
around free all summer.

1453
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:47,609
- Carmen, he's been running
around free all winter.

1454
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:49,999
It's a good place to be 12 years old.

1455
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,509
It's a lot better than where I grew up.

1456
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:55,929
- Any time you wanna trade
poor people's troubles

1457
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:59,019
for rich people's
troubles, you let me know.

1458
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,859
- Carmen, I'm scrubbing
clothes in a tin tub

1459
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,919
and you're talking to
me about rich people?

1460
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,059
I'm having my honeymoon in a jail.

1461
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,029
- Well, you had a choice.

1462
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:10,319
You didn't have to marry a hustler.

1463
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,219
- Listen, some women fuck up, I fuck down.

1464
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,979
A flaw in my character.

1465
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:15,980
- Ha.

1466
01:10:17,058 --> 01:10:18,058
I know.

1467
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,050
- Paco's gonna be all right.

1468
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,150
You think this is too corny?

1469
01:10:33,327 --> 01:10:34,819
- I didn't think so when I bought it.

1470
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,549
- Oh yeah, sorry. (laughing)

1471
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,383
Can I borrow it?

1472
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:39,839
- It's honeymoon time,

1473
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,699
anything you want, girlfriend.

1474
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,319
- Thank you Carmen, you're a sweetheart.

1475
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,559
I have never waited so long
for four weeks to pass.

1476
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,019
72 hours of marital bliss.

1477
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,163
I am going to blow that man's mind.

1478
01:10:55,911 --> 01:10:58,828
(Barney whistling)

1479
01:11:01,296 --> 01:11:02,649
(Barney groaning)

1480
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,430
- Oh my god.

1481
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:08,065
Oh.

1482
01:11:08,066 --> 01:11:10,024
(Barney groaning)

1483
01:11:10,025 --> 01:11:12,265
Oh my god.

1484
01:11:12,266 --> 01:11:15,056
(Barney gasping)

1485
01:11:15,057 --> 01:11:16,057
- You okay?

1486
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:18,450
- No.

1487
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:20,919
I'm dying.

1488
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,079
- Look, I'll go get some help, okay?

1489
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,629
- I'll be dead before you get back.

1490
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,259
- So then what should I do?

1491
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,393
- When I die,

1492
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,423
you want my map?

1493
01:11:34,298 --> 01:11:35,573
To where my goldmine is?

1494
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:39,729
Come here, will you take,

1495
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:40,743
take off my boot?

1496
01:11:43,468 --> 01:11:44,968
Take off the boot.

1497
01:12:02,525 --> 01:12:05,108
(somber music)

1498
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:14,430
- [Richie] What's up, Paco?

1499
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,109
- I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, missy,

1500
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:18,619
but Lyle's in isolation.

1501
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,619
That means no visiting privileges.

1502
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:23,729
- But our wedding night,
our conjugal visit.

1503
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,289
- He blew it.

1504
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:28,329
He tore up his cell, attacked the guards.

1505
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:30,129
- When can I see him?

1506
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:31,680
When can we have our honeymoon?

1507
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:36,369
When can I see my husband?

1508
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,440
- When he starts obeying the
rules of this institution,

1509
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:40,691
now it's as simple as that.

1510
01:12:42,604 --> 01:12:45,320
(Kathy sighing)

1511
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:48,449
(tense music)

1512
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:51,700
(rattlesnake rattling)

1513
01:12:55,095 --> 01:12:58,012
(insects chirping)

1514
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:02,846
(saloon door creaking)

1515
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,050
- The hell happened to you?

1516
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,229
- Nothing good.

1517
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:10,230
Nothing.

1518
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,069
- You're supposed to
be tucked up with Lyle.

1519
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,623
- Yeah, supposed to be.

1520
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:20,949
Carman, sometimes I don't
think I can take it anymore.

1521
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,180
I don't think I want to.

1522
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,020
- Come on.

1523
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,383
Have a sit down.

1524
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,063
Tell me what's going on, okay?

1525
01:13:35,816 --> 01:13:36,918
I'll get us a drink.

1526
01:13:36,919 --> 01:13:37,919
- Okay.

1527
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,029
- Two weeks, I've been asking Jim

1528
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,329
to fix the fucking generator
so we can have some cold beer.

1529
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,229
Has he fixed it? No.

1530
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:49,259
For sitting in the bar, he's got time.

1531
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,139
For running around the
desert, plenty of time.

1532
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,362
Here, we'll drink it warm.

1533
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:55,196
- What the hell.

1534
01:13:55,196 --> 01:13:56,196
Warm's better than hot.

1535
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,353
- My sister, you are learning.

1536
01:14:03,634 --> 01:14:06,134
(tense music)

1537
01:14:28,312 --> 01:14:29,312
- Yes.

1538
01:14:44,277 --> 01:14:46,944
(magical music)

1539
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:54,099
Goldmine.

1540
01:14:54,893 --> 01:14:57,673
A true goldmine.

1541
01:15:02,879 --> 01:15:05,046
- Life's supposed to work,

1542
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:08,100
but you never get the instructions,

1543
01:15:09,023 --> 01:15:10,623
like you do with a VCR.

1544
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,410
Some people get that,
you know, that booklet.

1545
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,040
I always wanted that.

1546
01:15:19,823 --> 01:15:21,373
- It was gonna be so beautiful.

1547
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,678
And that nightie you lent
me, Carmen, it was so sexy.

1548
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,739
- Oh honey, you're still gonna wear it,

1549
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,333
don't you worry about nothing.

1550
01:15:33,584 --> 01:15:35,319
- Mom, we're rich!

1551
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,719
- Oh, Pacito, give mama a big kiss.

1552
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,249
Give Kathy one too,
she's a little depressed.

1553
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,329
- Rich, I found a fucking goldmine.

1554
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,339
- Oh Pacito, don't swear, it's not nice.

1555
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,456
- Now Richie won't have to steal no more,

1556
01:15:47,457 --> 01:15:49,349
and we can all stay here together.

1557
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,220
- Oh, why not?

1558
01:15:50,221 --> 01:15:53,079
You found a tiger, a lion, an elephant.

1559
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,999
- No elephants, there was no elephant.

1560
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,299
- Why not a goldmine?

1561
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,809
- All right, you don't have to believe me,

1562
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,770
I can show it to you,

1563
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:03,039
I got a map from this old guy, he died.

1564
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,319
- Oh, it's okay, Pacito,
we don't need no goldmine.

1565
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,089
I love you so much.

1566
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,839
And that's better than gold.

1567
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,349
- I lost it!

1568
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,650
- You lost something, hon?

1569
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,479
- My map, my treasure map.

1570
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,169
It must've fallen outta my pockets

1571
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:20,089
when I was climbing down the rocks.

1572
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:24,169
Well, that's okay, I know
how to find the place again.

1573
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,003
- That's good.

1574
01:16:25,004 --> 01:16:27,069
- By the Indian head
rock, that's where it is.

1575
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,758
So, come on, I'll show you.

1576
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:31,852
- Ay, Pacito, I can't move.

1577
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:34,163
- Okay, I'll show you tomorrow.

1578
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,659
I can find it again, I know where it is.

1579
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,669
Come on, I'll take you there.

1580
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:41,503
- Now?

1581
01:16:41,504 --> 01:16:43,722
- You got something
better than a goldmine?

1582
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:46,223
(tense music)

1583
01:16:49,627 --> 01:16:50,710
- Shit, ATVs.

1584
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:01,829
- What the hell is this place?

1585
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,209
- This is our home.

1586
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,309
- You own this place?

1587
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,909
- I told you, we live here.

1588
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:08,059
- Well, if you don't own
it, it's public property,

1589
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,179
and we're the public,

1590
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,289
so we have just as much
right to be here as you.

1591
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:13,729
- Look, it's a big desert.

1592
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,779
Why don't you just leave us alone?

1593
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,981
- We're not ready to go yet.

1594
01:17:16,982 --> 01:17:17,815
(gun clicking)

1595
01:17:17,816 --> 01:17:19,579
- Oh, lookie here, an armed man!

1596
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,676
He's got himself a .22!

1597
01:17:21,677 --> 01:17:22,977
You wanna see what we got?

1598
01:17:24,653 --> 01:17:27,059
(guns clicking)

1599
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,829
Wanna talk firepower, asshole?

1600
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:30,399
I got 30 rounds.

1601
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,409
I could fire faster than
you can pull that trigger.

1602
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,169
Don't be threatening us with a BB gun.

1603
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:36,109
- Okay, everybody put their guns down now.

1604
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,110
- Jim, do it.

1605
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,060
Jim.

1606
01:17:44,504 --> 01:17:45,337
(gun banging)

1607
01:17:45,338 --> 01:17:49,229
(Carmen and Kathy screaming)

1608
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,829
- Just so you know what
these babies can do.

1609
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,539
- You wave that candy
piece of shit at us again,

1610
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,288
I'll carve you a new asshole.

1611
01:17:54,289 --> 01:17:55,599
(tense music)

1612
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,909
- We're going now.

1613
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,389
Not because you told us to,

1614
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:59,619
but because we want to.

1615
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,929
You better get a little more firepower

1616
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,430
before you give us any orders.

1617
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,029
Ciao, baby.

1618
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:14,947
(tires screeching)

1619
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,143
- All right, that's it.

1620
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:23,836
- What, you're gonna
go do something stupid?

1621
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:25,790
- I told you I was going hunting.

1622
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,749
- Stay here, stay here.

1623
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,302
- I am going with Jim.

1624
01:18:31,303 --> 01:18:32,853
- Paco!

1625
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:35,687
(engine rumbling)

1626
01:18:46,843 --> 01:18:47,843
- Hey Jim!

1627
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:50,667
Jim.

1628
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,873
- Not now, Paco, I'm sorry,
but I got things to do.

1629
01:18:57,874 --> 01:19:00,707
(engine rumbling)

1630
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:24,465
(engine rumbling)

1631
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:33,576
(engines rumbling)

1632
01:19:39,228 --> 01:19:41,728
(tense music)

1633
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:08,872
(men whooping)

1634
01:20:22,331 --> 01:20:23,357
(explosion banging)

1635
01:20:23,358 --> 01:20:26,025
(men screaming)

1636
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:30,893
(rock thudding)

1637
01:20:37,922 --> 01:20:40,505
(somber music)

1638
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,473
- [Jim] It's war now, you barbarians!

1639
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:51,060
Rattlesnake Jim is making his stand.

1640
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:53,811
(coyote howling)

1641
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:04,414
(gentle music)

1642
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,521
- I love this little ball.

1643
01:21:07,522 --> 01:21:09,772
Every time I see it, I
love it more and more.

1644
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,010
You know what?

1645
01:21:13,011 --> 01:21:16,169
What's worrying me though, is baby names.

1646
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,639
I got this list here I been working on,

1647
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,473
I want you to take a look

1648
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,619
and tell me if any of it knocks you out.

1649
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,709
- What worries me is
that the baby's gonna be

1650
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,109
nearly a year old when you get out,

1651
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:26,369
and what are we gonna do then?

1652
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,203
- You're right, I know,

1653
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:29,119
and I've been giving that
some very serious thought.

1654
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,229
- And?

1655
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,379
- Well, I'm still thinking, you know?

1656
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,419
I'm turning possibilities over in my head.

1657
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,670
- Like what, for example?

1658
01:21:37,157 --> 01:21:38,729
- Well, lots of stuff, you know?

1659
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,829
I mean, good opportunities.

1660
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,389
I mean, I know for sure that I
don't wanna take no state job

1661
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,169
'cause that's just dead end city,

1662
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,152
and I want something
where I can get ahead.

1663
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,122
- Good.

1664
01:21:49,123 --> 01:21:51,019
- We got no more trouble
from those ATV people.

1665
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,319
They don't come anywhere near us.

1666
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,733
They think we mined the whole desert.

1667
01:21:54,734 --> 01:21:55,752
(Jim laughing)

1668
01:21:55,753 --> 01:21:56,931
- I wish I had.

1669
01:21:56,932 --> 01:21:59,599
- Trouble with this guy
is he's a fucking elitist.

1670
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,769
Jim, the desert belongs to everyone,

1671
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:01,959
everyone's got the right to enjoy it.

1672
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,819
- Not if they're gonna
screw it up, they don't.

1673
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,653
- Yeah, well what you're saying is

1674
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:06,369
you got the right to
decide who's screwing it up

1675
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:08,659
and who's just enjoying it, man.

1676
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,939
Modern times, people like to
ride around on those ATVs.

1677
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:13,089
- No, what I'm saying is
that nobody's got the right

1678
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:15,469
to ruin paradise, and
the desert is paradise.

1679
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:16,826
It's the last one we got left.

1680
01:22:16,827 --> 01:22:17,660
- Bullshit.

1681
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:19,529
- Hey, I know that guy.

1682
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:21,580
- He's a new fish, he's in for tax fraud.

1683
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:24,353
- That's Lyle's hotshot lawyer.

1684
01:22:24,354 --> 01:22:25,187
- Yeah, we got a lot of lawyers in here.

1685
01:22:25,188 --> 01:22:27,149
Is there anymore potato salad?

1686
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,539
- I can get this case reopened

1687
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,319
for illegal search and seizure.

1688
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,109
I'm not gonna charge you
an arm and a leg either,

1689
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,339
that I promise you.

1690
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,173
You have a warrant on your house?

1691
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:36,633
- Yeah.
- You own the car?

1692
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:40,259
- Hey, how you doing, Frank?

1693
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,052
- Oh, pretty good, Pac.

1694
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:43,609
How about you?

1695
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:44,960
You find the gold mine yet.

1696
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,083
- [Paco] I'm still looking.

1697
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,730
- Good for you, buddy.

1698
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,350
- I just don't understand

1699
01:22:52,351 --> 01:22:54,250
how that Indian head rock disappeared.

1700
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,743
- Well, there's lots
of mysteries out there.

1701
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:01,930
Lots of strange shit going down.

1702
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:05,876
(upbeat music)

1703
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:10,560
- [Kathy] Listen to this.

1704
01:23:10,561 --> 01:23:13,139
Lyle wants Lyle Jr. If it's a boy,

1705
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,355
and Lyla if it's a girl.

1706
01:23:15,356 --> 01:23:16,529
(Kathy and Carmen laughing)

1707
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,189
- [Carmen] You gotta
name this kid for a saint

1708
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:19,359
so somebody's looking on.

1709
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,229
They're on duty 24 hours.

1710
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,230
- [Kathy] Well, who's the patron saint

1711
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:24,349
of the baby conceived
during a conjugal visit?

1712
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:25,599
- [Carmen] That would be Saint Rita.

1713
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,049
Go with it, Kathy, you
can't be too careful.

1714
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,059
- [Kathy] What if it's a boy?

1715
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:32,019
- [Carmen] Call him
Jesus, then he's covered.

1716
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,239
- [Kathy] But I'm not Catholic, Carmen.

1717
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,298
- [Carmen] So name him Elvis.
