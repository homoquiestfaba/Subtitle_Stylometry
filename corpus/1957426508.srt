1
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:20,542
I believe... I truthfully believe that
reality television has saved television.

2
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:25,764
I... You know, actors, writers,
producers, directors, agents,

3
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,984
we all aspire to the truth,
you know?

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,378
And what greater truth
is there than reality?

5
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,119
Even when it's scripted.

6
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,251
You've gotta hand it to Coach Ty
Carhart for breaking this team's long...

7
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,253
and turning this team
into a real...

8
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,255
Alright.
Well, that's all of it, Jaynie.

9
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,127
You better get home, or your mom's
gonna kill me. And remember...

10
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,303
I know, I know.
Vance wasn't here.

11
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:29,132
- Right.
- Thanks! Bye, Vance. Great game tonight!

12
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,744
Bye, kidlet. I'm gonna go up
and try tweaking the dish,

13
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,658
see if we can get
some reception.

14
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:40,926
Uh... babe, I know it's weird,
but are you sure you're okay?

15
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,711
I mean, with his release
and everything?

16
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm okay.

17
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:48,717
Some dads give interviews to Fox
Sports, and some to parole boards.

18
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,719
Mm...

19
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:56,158
You know,
when this show hits the air,

20
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:58,553
you're gonna be the next
Blanca Champion, baby.

21
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,337
Vance.

22
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:04,863
She's skanky and blonde and rich.
We have nothing in common.

23
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:08,519
Whoa, not true. You both have
smokin' hot little booties.

24
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,435
Come on.
We have to close up.

25
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,568
Then I can focus
all my attention on you.

26
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,659
Go fix the dish while I turn
off the lights on the trails.

27
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:21,097
Okay, roger that. I can get the lights,
too. Just finish up in here. Really.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,231
I'll do it. I'll do it.
Don't take too long.

29
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,972
Hurry, please.

30
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,575
Couldn't wait, huh?

31
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,233
Very funny, Vance.

32
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,235
Come on,
you know I hate this shit.

33
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,932
Vance?

34
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,086
Ah!

35
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,885
Come on, Vance.

49
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,808
This is Margo Moorehead, reporting live
outside the Culver City Courthouse,

50
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,768
where it looks like even more
bad news for Blanca Champion.

51
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:37,075
On the heels of her well-publicized
bout with exhaustion

52
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,252
come allegations of assault
and battery from John Jordan,

53
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,560
a production assistant on the
set of her new movie, Hush, Hush.

54
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:48,391
As expected, Jordan filed suit today
against Champion and Affiliated Studios.

55
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:52,395
Allegedly, Champion found a
green-tea latte not to her liking.

56
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,400
That's when sources say Champion proceeded
to hurl the scalding-hot drink at Jordan,

57
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,924
causing second-degree burns
from his torso,

58
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,840
well, down to his more delicate
regions.

59
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,668
In a statement
released this morning,

60
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,105
Champion swears the beverage
was only lukewarm,

61
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,500
which is, indeed, why she threw
it at him in the first place.

62
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,676
This is Margo Moorehead,
reporting...

63
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,375
- Hey. - Where exactly did
you burn? Show us again.

64
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,519
I, uh... I was starting to
think that I'd never work again.

65
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:22,991
Oh, stop it, stop it.
Come on. Ahem.

66
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,491
- Alright, I'm excited. Tell me
about this job. - I'm serious, okay?

67
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,649
It's a great concept for a reality show.
Now, picture this:

68
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,434
a small border town,
the high-school hockey team

69
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,784
on a 100-year losing streak
winds up with a star forward.

70
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,831
For the first time
in the school's history,

71
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,921
they got a shot at the State Championship.
Production's running behind.

72
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,532
They need a solid director,
and I told them you're the guy.

73
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,970
Underdog sports team,
kid makes good. I like it.

74
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,842
I knew it. I knew it.
Now get this.

75
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,800
The team's called
The Gold Diggers.

76
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,890
They're from this tiny, little town
called White Plains in North Dakota...

77
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,632
North Dakota? Oh, wow.

78
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:59,506
Uh... border town kinda makes
it sound like... Mexico.

79
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,551
Uh... I don't know, Seaton.

80
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,616
I'm from San Diego. I think
I might freeze my ass off.

81
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,729
I know. I get it, okay?
Now get over it.

82
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:09,429
And besides, the network would
really consider this one a favour.

83
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,083
And, actually, there's
one more thing. What?

84
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,826
Blanca Champion's gonna be
up there with you.

85
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:20,091
- Blanca Champion? - Her next movie's
with the network's film division,

86
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:22,267
and she's playing
a reality-television director

87
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,182
who uncovers
some major political scandal.

88
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,596
Haven't read the script yet. She
wants to do the whole method thing,

89
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,448
you know, be taken seriously
as an actress.

90
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,624
And since you and Blanca
work so well together,

91
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,843
the network thought
that she could observe you.

92
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,541
Work well together?
Seaton, I...

93
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,891
I was her production assistant
on her first movie.

94
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,328
I was a glorified babysitter.
I doubt she even remembers me.

95
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:42,505
Well, guess what. Not only does she
remember you, she loves, loves the idea.

96
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,507
She says this time around,
she could be your PA.

97
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,510
Besides, with all the bad publicity
she's been getting lately,

98
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,643
she could use
a little babysitting.

99
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,733
Seaton,
let me get this straight.

100
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:57,215
You want me to go to a remote town
in a red state that borders Canada

101
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:01,655
with Blanca Champion pretending
to fetch people coffee? What?

102
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,676
Seaton, that's ridiculous.
I... I'm not that broke.

103
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,877
And to be honest with you, life is
too short. And how's it even possible?

104
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,856
You know what it's like going out in public
with her. Draws crowds like The Beatles.

105
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,056
No, no, no,
that's the beauty, Jake.

106
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,426
The townspeople have already
signed non-disclosure agreements.

107
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,410
You and Blanca are gonna be in the middle
of nowhere. Only studio publicity knows.

108
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,259
And by the time the World Press gets
wind of it, your show will be wrapped.

109
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,243
And best of all, they're gonna pay your
rate. Yeah-ha. Yeah, you're welcome.

110
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,551
Can I bring my dog?

111
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:33,556
My name is Nik and I am a PA
on the show Digger Fever.

112
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,341
White Plains is the kind of city
that...

113
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,779
people in Middle America
make fun of.

114
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,219
There you go, buddy.
How you doing, buddy?

115
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,134
I missed you, yeah.
I missed you.

116
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:49,572
Hey, you must be Jake.
I'm Greg, the production's UPM.

117
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,139
Hey, man.
Nice to meet you.

118
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:54,751
It's about a six-hour drive
to White Plains from here.

119
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,145
I was surprised there was
no other crew on the plane.

120
00:08:57,188 --> 00:09:00,061
Well, most of the crew arrived
the Monday before last.

121
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:03,020
It's been pretty intense here
with all that's happened.

122
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:06,284
- Why? What's happened?
- One of the local girls just got killed.

123
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,286
ATV accident.

124
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,725
Town folk pretty much freaked
out when Ted, our first director,

125
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,944
tried to get exclusive
with them about it.

126
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:18,558
Wait. Ted... your first director?
So I'm... I'm replacing him?

127
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,474
Dude, those agent types aren't too
big on full disclosure, are they?

128
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,567
We're taking a poll this morning
on Good Morning White Plains.

129
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,960
Bob Hansen, you're...

130
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,671
Jake, this intersection's
a good landmark.

131
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,804
It's exactly 39 miles
from your cabin.

132
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:50,894
The mini-market on the right is
where we do most of our shopping.

133
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,510
- Is this the place?
- Yeah, almost.

134
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:01,296
It's about another mile
and a half down this road.

135
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:16,311
The second door on your right's
the bedroom.

136
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:19,140
You're sharing this place with
Lee, our executive producer.

137
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:28,149
Oh, by the way, Lee wants to meet
you in an hour at the local diner

138
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,890
for a production meeting.

139
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,808
Uh, okay. Um...
so it's just me and Lee here?

140
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,810
Is... is he here right now?

141
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,812
Yeah, uh, she, and no.

142
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,336
She's actually sleeping
at one of the other crew cabins,

143
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,381
but we're not supposed
to know about that.

144
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,558
Got map and directions...
and keys.

145
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,431
Peace out, brother.

146
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,005
Bongo...
what did I just get us into?

147
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,704
I generally tell my clients
what they need to know.

148
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:05,839
And... and Jake needed a job,
and, um... and he got it.

149
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,632
I can't hear...
You're gonna have to speak up.

150
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,329
I can't hear you.

151
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,903
Hello? Sit.

152
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,949
Oh, piece of crap.

153
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,169
You must be Jake.
I'm Phoebe, Lee's assistant.

154
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,867
We're totally excited
you're here.

155
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,086
Jake, I'm Lee Tyson,
the show's producer.

156
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,132
Thank you for getting here
so quick.

157
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:41,178
Hey, Phoebe, do me a favour. Will
you go call the equipment house,

158
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,919
see where the rest
of our stuff is?

159
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,748
Sure. I'll be right back.

160
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,317
Okay, look, here's the deal:

161
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,469
these people think we are here
to shoot a reality show

162
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,538
about their loser hockey team
making good.

163
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,367
But some girl kills herself
joy riding at night,

164
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,587
probably drunk on moonshine
or something.

165
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,131
Everyone's all bent out of shape
about this except Coach Carhart,

166
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,418
who only cares about winning
the championship.

167
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,464
Now, did I mention the ex-coach,
Hansen?

168
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,771
He's a flippin' loon
who just got out prison

169
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,208
for "accidentally" killing
his wife 10 years ago.

170
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,820
Carhart's son was banging
Hansen's daughter.

171
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,778
Hansen's daughter...

172
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,433
ends up dead.
It's fucking gold.

173
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,958
Wow. Yeah, um...

174
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:24,004
that's... that's a lot
of information.

175
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:30,837
Uh... you know, Lee, I... I kind of liked
the whole underdog-hockey-team angle.

176
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,102
Uh, not really such a fan
of messing with people's heads.

177
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,628
And I am telling you that I want
you to go to that high school

178
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:44,546
and shoot me a fuckin' show about these crazy
coaches and their beer-guzzling buddies.

179
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,243
Got it?

180
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:51,161
- Seaton Brookstone's office.
- Hello? Hey, Shannon.

181
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,859
Hey, it's Jake. Is Seaton in?

182
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:55,644
Hi, Jake.
Having a bad time hearing you.

183
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:59,169
Not a good connection. I don't have
Seaton right now. He's in a meeting.

184
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,389
Yeah, I'm sure he is.
Listen, Shannon, I...

185
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,958
This is the first time I've had any
bars on my phone since I landed.

186
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,612
Something... something's off here,
and I really need to talk to him

187
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,528
before I go in and start this thing up.
Have him call me, please?

188
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,880
Hello?

189
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,186

193
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,172
I'm Keir, your camera assistant.

194
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,304
Or at least I think so.

195
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:50,307
'Cause no one spends that much
money on sunglasses around here.

196
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,616
So I figure you're Jake, right?
Uh... I... I am.

197
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,011
Um... and I got these for free
off my last show.

198
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,144
I was, um... I was worried they
were a bit too fancy for me.

199
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,885
No, you pull them off well.

200
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,280
Can I talk you into maybe...
showing me around this place?

201
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,456
So did you meet Lee?

202
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,980
Oh, yeah.

203
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:14,636
Yeah, she's quite a lady.
And I use the term loosely.

204
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,118
Look, before we go in, uh...

205
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:21,469
I don't mean to cross any lines,
but can I show you something?

206
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,427
Yeah, sure.

207
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,392
I'm dying to Google
these people.

208
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,046
I don't know
if you've tried yet,

209
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,483
but it's impossible to get
on the internet up here.

210
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,746
I've tried the dial-up,
like, 30 times,

211
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,096
only to get knocked off
after 10 seconds.

212
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,837
This is the girl that died.

213
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,927
Jaynie, right?
Yeah.

214
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,495
This girl's death was just...

215
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,192
so violent.

216
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,936
So you started checking into the
town's history... hoping to find what?

217
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,417
I don't know, but let's just
say for a town this small,

218
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,985
this place has had its share
of death and drama.

219
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:04,425
"Left behind are Ty Carhart
and his two-year-old, Vance,

220
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:07,471
the surviving twin. Father
and son were in Whiskey River,

221
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,952
picking up supplies
when the accident happened."

222
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,956
This is Carhart...
the hockey coach?

223
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:17,742
- Yep. - I mean, this is...
an awful story, all of it.

224
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:22,008
But... I don't really get what it
has to do with this ATV accident.

225
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:26,186
You two have to leave. Now!

226
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:30,668
Jaynie Hansen's death, um, you
know, where... where I'm from,

227
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,715
you get a cut, a scrape, a broken
leg, is considered an accident.

228
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:37,240
What happened to her... I don't
think that was an accident.

229
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,289
Five, six, here we go.

230
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,944

00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,125

00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:55,128
We're not gonna beat Eagle Ridge
unless you show some hustle, boy!

235
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:58,392
Maybe we ought to take this
practice outside, run a few laps.

236
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,785
Then you'll play like men
instead of wussies.

237
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,222
Come on, Coach.

238
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:06,922
- That kid's not getting much of
a mourning period, huh? - Come on!

239
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,837
Is that Luke? Luke!

240
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:13,059
- Jake! Ha-ha!
- I didn't know you were on this show, man.

241
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,931
Thank God you're here, dude. These
people are a bunch of freaks!

242
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,065
- We did a show called Your Town over
in Miami a few years ago. - Yeah.

243
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,981
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Let me put it to you this way.

244
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,374
Our sound guy's a local hire
who lives in his car.

245
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,135
We should get going
'cause Lee's gonna get here,

246
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,117
and that woman,
we do not want to piss off.

247
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,859
- Alright, man. Good to see you. Yeah.
- See you in a bit.

248
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,218
What the...?

249
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,872
Here he is!

250
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,048
How you doin', man? Alright.

251
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,051
Jake, looks like
you already met Keir.

252
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,315
This is Daphne,
our story producer.

253
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,317
And this is Mike,
your sound guy.

254
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:57,494
Hey, man, have we worked
together before?

255
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:00,019
- What?
- Hi, Jake.

256
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,239
- Hi. - I know it's trèsgeeky
to say, but I love your work.

257
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,111
I'm so excited
you're on this project.

258
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,853
Back on the Ranch
is my favourite show. Was.

259
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:11,595
Uh, well, thank you. I'm glad
you liked it. I did, too.

260
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,597
Alright, the only one missing
is Nik, our PA.

261
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,295
But he went to Winnipeg
to pick up Blanca.

262
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,079
She's arriving by helicopter.
Isn't that cool?

263
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:21,040
- Yeah, it's very cool.
- I was the first one here,

264
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,521
so if you want the backstory on
anyone, cast or crew, come to me.

265
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,872
Hi, Daphne!
Is she here yet?

266
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,136
Almost! That's Erin,
the head cheerleader.

267
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,138
She's very excited
to meet Blanca.

268
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,924
Blanca Champion is coming to White
Plains to do research for a movie role.

269
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:39,623
She's playing a reality-TV director who
uncovers some big political scandal.

270
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:49,546
I can't even begin
to believe this.

271
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,833
Oh, I...
I'll be right back. Okay.

272
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,403
Hi, Blanca.

273
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:24,059
- Hi, Scooby.
- Hi.

274
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,540
- Hi.
- Uh...

275
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,455
what the hell are you wearing?

276
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,892
- I was told to dress sexy.
- By who? Seaton?

277
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,635
- It's being handled, right, sweetheart?
- Handled!

278
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,204
Ms. Champion,
I am so excited to meet you.

279
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,162
I... I...
I am your biggest fan.

280
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:43,818
You are a personal hero to me. Do
you think you can sign this, please?

281
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,169
- Sure, sweetie.
- Um...

282
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:50,216
I know it's none of my business,
but you two were so close.

283
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:52,087
Why were you fighting?

284
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,698
- Because she's a cunt.
- Okay.

285
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:57,005
Uh, excuse us for a second.
We're just gonna...

286
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,096
Um, I'm a big fan, too.

287
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,576
Yeah?

288
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,187
We'll have a little talk,
shall we?

289
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,798
Okay. Easy, Scooby.
You're turning me on.

290
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:10,192
Please don't call me Scooby.

291
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,368
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

292
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:16,633
Hey, buddy, um, do you mind
excusing us for a second?

293
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:21,508
Hey, sexy. I like where those
shorts cup your little ass.

294
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,859
It's delicious.

295
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,560
Blanca...
do you even remember me?

296
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:34,260
I'm sorry. Are we in the boys' locker room?
It stinks in here. Blech!

297
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:37,654
Yeah. No, I know this isn't,
uh, exactly ideal,

298
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,657
but I hear if we make it through the
next few weeks on our best behaviour,

299
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,920
we're gonna score big bonus
points with the studio.

300
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:46,315
- Ooh, what's best behaviour?
- Well, it's probably, uh,

301
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,883
not using the "C" word in front
of the small-town cheerleaders.

302
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,625
Oh, God. They're dealing with
some heavy shit around here.

303
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:55,585
A local girl recently got killed in an
accident, so the people are pretty shook up.

304
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,283
Alright, whatever.

305
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,113
Okay, you know what?
I get it.

306
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:06,292
And I'm serious about this
movie research stuff, okay?

307
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,250
I'm sick of playing
dopey teenagers.

308
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,600
I have to nail this.
We're cool.

309
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,037
Alright. Oh, hey, and uh,

310
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:17,390
it's kinda cold in here, so you may want
to rethink the whole mini-skirt thing.

311
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,522
- Fuck off.
- Okay. Nice. Very nice.

312
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:22,743
- Blanca Champion. Wow! - I'd say
we have a pretty unique connection.

313
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:26,921
I mean, how many guys can say that they've
carried all 28 pieces of her luggage?

314
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:32,056
She's, uh... she's very, uh...
I... How to say this?

315
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,538
I held her hand. Well, I...
I blocked her hand.

316
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:40,021
Yeah, she was trying to hit me.
It was my fault. I made a mistake.

317
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,849
But, yeah, I mean,
we're pretty close.

318
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,690
Vance Carhart scores again!

319
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,474
By the way,
ladies and gentlemen,

320
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,781
don't forget to look for
yourself on television this fall

321
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:05,002
as the Diggers star in Digger
Fever, their very own reality show.

322
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,614
Yeah! Oh!

323
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,877
We are just so blessed
by Jesus Christ,

324
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,706
and I know that he really wants
us to win State.

325
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,099
I'm sorry, but I gotta ask.
What can you tell me

326
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:18,320
about your friend Jaynie's death or
her father's release from prison?

327
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,540
Um...

328
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,064
I don't think I'm supposed
to talk about that.

329
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,197
Erin, let's wrap this up.

330
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,200
I have to go now.

331
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,903
You know... I don't even want to tell
you what I saw down in that boiler room.

332
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,732
The townspeople are all
up in my grill because...

333
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:42,301
I've got my crew asking questions
that aren't just about hockey.

334
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,129
Give me a break. Do these people
don't even own a fucking television?

335
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:47,784
It's not like the show's for the
fucking Nature Channel, people.

336
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,298
Where are we even going,
anyways?

337
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,084
And I can't believe this
is the crew van. So lame.

338
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,527
It's a low-budget show. The
school let us use this for free.

339
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:16,133
Look, guys, if this is what the kids are
talking about, this is the story to follow.

340
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,440
Everyone we've talked to
has brought up this Hansen guy.

341
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,835
- Does anyone know how long this guy's
been outta prison? - Less than a month.

342
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:26,666
Do I need to remind you that I'm on a
10-hour schedule and I don't do overtime?

343
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,232
Okay.

344
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,799
Thanks, Mike.

345
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,236
- Whatever.
- Nik, any idea where this cabin is?

346
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,457
Erin said we can't miss it.
Should be just off the lake.

347
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,228
Hello?

348
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,497
Coach Hansen?

349
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,866
Hi. Uh, my name's Jake Tanner,

350
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,347
and, um, we're in town
shooting a show...

351
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,393
"Wash me thoroughly from my
iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.

352
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:47,311
Against Thee have I only sinned and
done that which is evil in Thy sight."

353
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,444
This is fucking scary as shit.

354
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,926
I'm just gonna put this microphone
on you right here, okay? Ah!

355
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:56,886
Get the hell outta here. I didn't invite
you here. This is private property.

356
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,934
I said get the hell out!

357
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,327
- Okay, okay. Sorry.
- All of ya!

358
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:07,070
- Didn't mean to bother you. We don't
want any trouble. - I want my microphone.

359
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:11,248
- Just leave it. - I'm billing
the production. - Just leave it.

360
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:16,447
Man, I've done a lot of shows where they
picketed us. Like Your Town Seattle,

361
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:18,473
they didn't want us there.
But this? This place...

362
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,823
You'd think
they don't even want an economy.

363
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:25,175
I mean, they just wanna, you know,
sit around and, you know... eat elk.

364
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,873
And the ex-coach,

365
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,832
he looks like the villain from
the Scooby Doo cartoons. Weird.

366
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:33,357
That reality-TV crew should've
been following me around, you know?

367
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:36,273
While they were out talking
to Jaynie Hansen's crazy dad,

368
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,668
I was finding the cheerleading coach's
body all mangled in the woodshop.

369
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,584
Now that would've made for some
great television, you know?

370
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,457
I took some footage with my camera
phone if you guys wanna buy it.

371
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,591
Honestly, I'd like to know
where the fuck my crew was

372
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,681
when that shloop was finding
a body in the woodshop.

373
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:56,119
Probably asking some little kid
about the thrill of victory.

374
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,391
I don't give a fuck who she is.
Her agent... Wait a minute.

375
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:09,393
That asshole is your agent, too,
isn't he? Yeah.

376
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:12,135
He made me pay her as a PA
while she does her research.

377
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,355
So guess what that means.
She needs to work

378
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,487
like a fucking PA,
so this is how it's gonna go.

379
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,229
As long as she's on my payroll,
remember this.

380
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,318
- Will do.
- I wanna know when she naps,

381
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:23,407
where she naps
and how long she naps.

382
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,019
You're gonna write it down, deduct
it from her paycheque. Got it?

383
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:28,543
Lee, why don't you give her
a break?

384
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,589
She travelled all night.
That's just great.

385
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,853
What do you want to do? Give her a fucking
bottle and change her diapers, too?

386
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:40,424
- Mister?
- Hey. What's up, buddy?

387
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,601
It wasn't an accident.

388
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,342
Okay, I'm listening.

389
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,345
Jaynie used to take me cross-country
skiing there all the time.

390
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,086
She knew that place.

391
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,003
I heard something
when I was leaving that night.

392
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,919
But I didn't do nothin'.

393
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,139
Well, you know what I think?

394
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:01,707
I think you're one brave
little guy for telling me that.

395
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,146
I'm gonna do some asking around.
Cool?

396
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,843
- Cool.
- Come on.

397
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:15,329
You know, if... you know,
if you wanna nap,

398
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,724
then, uh,
the bed in my camper is...

399
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,509
it's a lot more comfortable
than here.

400
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,903
I'm fine here, fuck face.
But thanks.

401
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,848
Lee?

402
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,588
You home?

403
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,073
Ah... Hey, buddy.

404
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:06,032
How you doing?

405
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:09,688
Yeah, you wanna go outside,
don't you? Alright.

406
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,168
Alright, come on.
Come on, Bongo.

407
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:16,520
Oh, shit!

408
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,827
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you scared the hell outta me.

409
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:22,657
Don't go digging up shit
you don't know nothing about.

410
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:25,486
- I'm sorry, what?
- You heard me!

411
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:27,749
It's a small town,
we all talk to each other.

412
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:30,404
I don't care to hear none of the
shit Coach Hansen is spinning.

413
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,972
He's an ex-con...
and a murderer.

414
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:36,236
Are we clear?

415
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,848
Yeah... we're clear.

416
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:48,030
I don't want to accuse Vance's dad of
having anything to do with these killings,

417
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,772
but... I have a weird inkling
that there...

418
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,556
there's some connection there.

419
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,958
Jesus Christ.

420
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,962
Oh, wow. Uh, Jesus. Sorry.

421
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,746
Nice timing, douchebag.

422
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,793
Um, we were just gonna go
get a beer or whatnot.

423
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,925
You should totally come.

424
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:58,840
Okay.

425
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,629
You're so bad.

426
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:23,909
I'm fairly certain
that Blanca chick wants me.

427
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:27,695
I have that extra sense,
you know.

428
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,002
Like, I can smell blood
a mile away.

429
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,526
I knew something was rotten
in Bismarck.

430
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,877
Sheriff says she was in there
for hours before I found her.

431
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,792
Has anyone told her husband?

432
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,012
Nah. He's downstate
on a timber run.

433
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,144
I tried him on the C.B.,
but no luck.

434
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,233
Who are you guys talking about?

435
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:47,584
There was... an accident
up at the school.

436
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:50,326
Miss Falls,
the cheerleading coach.

437
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,677
Decapitated.
Heartbeat-less.

438
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,071
I get it. It's awful.

439
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:59,509
Look, uh, what do you say
we cut outta here?

440
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,816
Let's go for a midnight swim.

441
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,514
- I'd say, "Hell, yeah."
- I'll get our coats.

442
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:12,522
No good can come
of you staying here.

443
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:15,090
Mark my words and leave now.

444
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,876
All of you.
Hey!

445
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,270
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man.

446
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,925
Jesus.

447
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,950
- Guess it's safe to say they don't like
us being here. - No, I don't think they do.

448
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:32,716
No, no, no. Don't any of you listen
to that crackpot. He's a drunk.

449
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,197
We just need to get our show
in the can and move on.

450
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,721
Now, wrap it up.
We've got an early-morning call.

451
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:42,335
I guess now isn't a good time to mention
they found Miss Falls's body at the school?

452
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:43,989
There was another accident.

453
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,860
Get the hell outta here.

454
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:54,347
Crazy shit.

455
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,524
What do I think about the amount
of accidents in this town? Um...

456
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,285
I think it's a shame it happened to all
the pretty people. I'm just kidding.

457
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,442
That's not even funny.
It's inappropriate. Sorry.

458
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,485
Did you hear this? Blanca Champion
has gotten herself into...

459
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,879
For the last time, I don't know
where the damn camera stuff is.

460
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,533
It never arrived.

461
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,492
Oh, will you just zip
your piehole?

462
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:56,583
I can't call the network and tell them
$30,000 worth of equipment is MIA!

463
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,933
It is not okay
to talk to me like that.

464
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,023
I did not sign on for this
totally deceptive job and whatnot.

465
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,436
And why can't you just give the
network the show they ordered?

466
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,941
It's a totally better show.

467
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:12,468
Because... no one wants to watch a
show about some wittle hockey team.

468
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:16,646
They'd much rather watch a show about
a bloodthirsty convict out for revenge.

469
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,300
That is why.

470
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,434
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

471
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:24,959
Did you seduce me because you
thought it would keep me quiet?

472
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,353
Because that was a total
miscalculation.

473
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:30,356
Well, I think that you're gonna keep quiet.
You know why?

474
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,054
If you don't, I will cancel
your plane ticket home,

475
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,057
I will drive you out into the
woods and I will leave you there.

476
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,886
You wouldn't do that to me.

477
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,237
You can try me, then we can
continue to play nice or not.

478
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,022
The choice is yours, Phoebe.

479
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,198
You're a real cooze.

480
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,113
And an awful boss.

481
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,695
As long as these guys play Digger
hockey and keep focused on the game,

482
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,958
there's not gonna
be any stopping 'em.

483
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,873
Look, I only got two hours till
the next game. I got things to do.

484
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,620
Come on!

485
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:21,536
Hey, is the, uh... is the coach mic'd?
I'm having trouble hearing him.

486
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:25,367
No, he's not mic'd. We left his out
at the crazy guy's shack, remember?

487
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,804
We gotta have this guy
mic'd before the playoff games.

488
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,242
Then I suggest you send
somebody out there to get it.

489
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:32,853
Okay... I'm sending you.

490
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:38,163
Yeah, I can do that. Except is there anybody
else here that can wire a PA system,

491
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:41,340
that can run a play-by-play?
It'll take me about 1.5 hours,

492
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:44,255
so it's a perfect amount of time
for you to do it yourself.

493
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,475
Okay, go rig your PA.

494
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,563
Hey, do me a favour. Um...

495
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:51,654
let's cut out
this whole smug-asshole thing,

496
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:54,135
'cause it's really working
my last nerve. Okay?

497
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,485
Okay.

498
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,183
Sorry, boss.

499
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,538
Motherfucker.
Nik.

500
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,150
A production assistant
on a show like this,

501
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:12,632
um... you're basically
like a bus boy's assistant.

502
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,941
Well, does this suck ass?
Mm-hmm.

503
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,945
Am I getting paid nearly enough
to do it?

504
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,339
No fucking way.

505
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,778
Hmm.

506
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,782
Coach?

507
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,397
Hey, uh... I'm really sorry
to bother you, but,

508
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,139
uh... we need to get
that microphone back.

509
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:42,966
Hello?

510
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:50,148
Don't be a puss. Ahem.

511
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,239
Look, uh... Coach, I'm just...

512
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:57,372
really wanted to apologize, uh,
about earlier today.

513
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,816
Oh, shit!

514
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,170
What the fuck?
What the fuck is it?

515
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,480
Ah!

516
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:34,888
These days, it doesn't seem that
Erin cares for Blanca too much.

517
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:37,369
Uh, I believe she called
her a...

518
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:40,502
a cocaine-fuelled gutter slut.

519
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,114
I need to talk to you.

520
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,118
Excuse me!
Get your hands off me, chunk!

521
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:51,470
I weigh 110 pounds!
That's not fat!

522
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:55,125
I have tried to be as nice
as I know how.

523
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,998
That's over!
I'm giving you this warning.

524
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,915
Stay away from Vance, or I'm going
to get my cousins to go to your cabin

525
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,744
and have them hog-tie you
and weigh you! Capisce?

526
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:08,922
You know what? Screw this!

527
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:12,491
I don't need this bullshit,
this fucking method-acting crap!

528
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,710
Hundred-and-ten pounds, my ass!

529
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,017
Listen up, you little pisher!

530
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,411
I don't give a shit if you're
losing me, this is important!

531
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,911
It's the first time I've had
reception since I've been out here.

532
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,285
You tell Seaton if he
still wants me as a client,

533
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,288
he will get me on the next
goddamn plane out of here, okay?!

534
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,421
Do you hear me? Hello?

535
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,814
Can you hear me now?

536
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,383
Fuckity fuck, fuck, fuck!!!

537
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,086
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Alright.

538
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,001
When's Desperate the Sound Elf
coming back?

539
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,134
I feel like an idiot.
Blanca.

540
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:50,156
Alright, we got five minutes till game
time. Is Nik back with that microphone?

541
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,313
He's not and there's no way
to reach him.

542
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,968
And Lee said if he doesn't get
here in five, he's fired.

543
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:59,015
- Oh, that's a little harsh, huh?
- And where's Mike? Mike!

544
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,540
I'm right here.
The PA system is rigged.

545
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:04,412
Alright, good.
Let's get ready to shoot.

546
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,249
Ah!

547
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:21,299
This season has been
nothing short of a phenomenon!

548
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,347
Goal!

549
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:33,049
The State Championship is just a
bus ride away for the Gold Diggers.

550
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:43,451
- Any sign of Nik?
- No. - That's so weird.

551
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,541
Oh, hey, Coach.
Great game tonight.

552
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,500
Hey, listen,
can I ask you a favour?

553
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:50,328
Favours aren't really
my specialty.

554
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,981
That's funny.

555
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:54,070
I noticed you had a treadmill
upstairs in the gym.

556
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,377
Would you mind if I grabbed
a quick workout?

557
00:38:56,638 --> 00:38:58,771
You know,
I like your dedication, boy.

558
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:01,513
More people should make fitness
a priority.

559
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,297
We're clearing out, so...

560
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,126
just make sure to lock the doors
when you leave.

561
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:08,302
- Thank you, sir.
- Ahem.

562
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,479
Oh, excuse me,
Coach Stick-up-your-Ass,

563
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,923
do you think that I might massage
your penis for a few minutes

564
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,005
so that I, too,
might get a workout?

565
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,314
Is it hard being
such a douchebag all the time?

566
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,537
Uh, no. No.
I actually kinda like it.

567
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,930
Loser.

568
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,867
Luke for Daphne.

569
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,438
Go ahead, Luke.

570
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,310
Was the Tahoe ever supposed
to be used as a cast car?

571
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:03,226
Not that I know of. Phoebe
handled all the rentals. Why?

572
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,838
It's just I found a lipstick
camera rigged in the backseat.

573
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:08,275
And I didn't put any lipstick
cameras on the equipment order,

574
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,538
and this is the second one
I found.

575
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:13,149
I didn't know this show
had that kind of surveil.

576
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:16,457
I didn't think so, either.
I'll ask.

577
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,198
Copy that.

578
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:48,184
Hello? I'm still up here.

579
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,709
Ah, what the hell, man?

580
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,977
Hello?

581
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:21,870
I'm beginning to think this
workout wasn't such a bright idea.

582
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,739
Ahem.

583
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,263
Whew.

584
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,049
Oh! What the fuck?
Who are you, man?

585
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:16,751
Ah!

586
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,969
Ah!

587
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,713
Ah! Fuck!

588
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:08,890
Ah! Ah!

589
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:22,817
Oh!

590
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,619
Have a lovely day.

591
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:49,322
Hey, I meant to ask,
did you guys

592
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:51,629
pre-rig the cars with cameras
before we got up here?

593
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:54,240
Can we please not talk
about work for a second?

594
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:56,677
I need a break from this show
and this town.

595
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,984
And um, mm, more liquor?

596
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,643
- Hey, any sign of Greg or Nik?
- No. I thought they'd be here already.

597
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,040
Yeah.

598
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,742
Hello! Hey, sugar puss.

599
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:20,396
Hi. See me standing here
with moolah in my hand?

600
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,050
No? Yes?

601
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:25,271
Hi! Hello. How are you?

602
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:29,405
- Atta girl. - Looks like Miss
Champion found herself another victim.

603
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:34,323
Okay... to the superstar
hockey player.

604
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:37,326
Well, to the super-hot
actress-slash-model.

605
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,243
Okay. I've been called worse,
but anyway.

606
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,941
Mm.

607
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,467
So, um...

608
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,904
I heard you were kind of close
to that girl that died.

609
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:52,428
Yeah, I guess, um...

610
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:55,301
I guess you could say this went
from being the best year of my life

611
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,869
to the worst in, you know,
a blink.

612
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,653
I'm really sorry.

613
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:03,396
My dad died when I was 14,

614
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,920
and I thought
I would never get over it.

615
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,925
I mean, it doesn't go away,
but... it gets easier.

616
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,973
Promise?

617
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,279
Yeah.

618
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:23,372
Isn't he a little young for her?
Is it still legal if it's a boy?

619
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:27,159
I heard she slept with that PA who sued
her, and then she got tired of him,

620
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,118
treated him like garbage
until finally he had enough.

621
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:33,295
- See, that's how rumours get started.
- You're saying it's not true?

622
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:36,298
I think the press likes
to paint Blanca as the bad girl,

623
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:39,867
and I think sometimes she feels obligated
to live up to those expectations.

624
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:42,957
I hate to be a buzz kill,
but I'm calling it a night.

625
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:46,526
Alright, do me a favour
and just be careful, please?

626
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,180
Okay.

627
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:58,494
Hello?

628
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:01,106
- I'm so glad I got through.
- Oh. Ha!

629
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:04,413
Oh, my God, I can't even begin
to believe this.

630
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:06,328
I haven't had reception
for days.

631
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,417
It's so good to hear your voice.

632
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,332
Totally.
I've been trying forever.

633
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:12,770
I was starting to get worried.
How's it going?

634
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,599
Oh, I need a margarita and a Palm Springs
weekend like you wouldn't believe.

635
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,560
Cathy?

636
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,780
Ah, dammit.

637
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,901
Greg, are you okay?

638
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:00,730
You been out here long?

639
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,124
Freeze to death.

640
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:06,998
Greg?

641
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,566
You stoned again?

642
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:13,221
Oh, my God!

643
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,941
What do you mean,
she didn't come home?

644
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:39,726
She wasn't in her bed when I woke up.
I thought maybe she got lucky.

645
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,902
With who, Blanca?
We watched her leave alone.

646
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,252
I can't believe you didn't
wake me up when you saw that.

647
00:47:44,296 --> 00:47:46,167
I thought maybe she hooked up
with you.

648
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,214
I caught her checking my ass out
a couple times. Get off my hump.

649
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:51,259
I told you as soon as I got up.

650
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:53,696
Jake, Coach says you have to
be on the ice in 10 minutes,

651
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,003
or you won't be allowed on
at all.

652
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,092
Sorry.

653
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:03,141
- Where's the rest of your crew? - You know
what, Lee? I'd like to know the same thing.

654
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:04,858
Something's really wrong here.
Luke is never late.

655
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,624
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, Phoebe, pull it together.

656
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:11,889
- Fuck you, Lee.
- What, again?

657
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:17,459
Jake, you've got five minutes. We
don't have a show without this game.

658
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,462
What do you want me to do? Three
quarters of my crew is missing!

659
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:24,423
Like I told the last guy, you're
the director, figure it out.

660
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,991
- Sure thing. Bitch.
- I'm sorry, what was that?

661
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:28,954
You know what, Lee?
I'm beginning to understand

662
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,386
why the first director
only lasted a few days. Yeah.

663
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,301
Keir, can you mix audio?

664
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:37,305
- I can try. - Okay. Blanca, I'm
gonna need you to hold the boom pole.

665
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,265
Oh, my God, I'm so gonna
fucking kill my acting coach.

666
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:45,835
Hey, you know what?

667
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:49,317
You do not talk to me that way
in front of the crew.

668
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:52,190
You finish out the day;
after that, you're fired.

669
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:01,329
Ah!

670
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,985
We just want to go
on record here

671
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:08,032
that a bunch
of our crew members are missing,

672
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,904
um, and Lee wants us
to shoot anyway.

673
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,168
But as soon as this is over,
we're gonna go find them.

674
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:25,658
We need to comb this school
and find that missing stuff.

675
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:28,356
You can't hide monitors
that size in a suitcase.

676
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,576
You are the one
who will go down for this.

677
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,579
This isn't Bewitched, Lee.
I can't just wiggle my nose

678
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,407
and make stuff appear
and whatnot.

679
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:38,845
Just try to keep an eye
on things here if you can.

680
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,979
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the crew.

681
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,546
One of those morons
is getting promoted to director.

682
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:50,030
Go.

683
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,000
Gotcha.

684
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:51,396
Holy shit.

685
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,883
What the fuck?

686
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,755
Oh!

687
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,367
Because...

688
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,805
no one wants to watch a show
about some wittle hockey team.

689
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:12,634
Oh, my God.
Am I being punked?

690
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:16,377
I thought they'd cancelled
this show. Ashton!

691
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,075
Oh! Ah!

692
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,946
No!

693
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,428
Ah! - What the fuck? - No!

694
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,301
No!

695
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,652
No!

696
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:19,484
Tell your camera guy I didn't appreciate him
leaving the treadmill and the lights on.

697
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:22,400
- Sorry, Coach. That's not
usually like him. - Ah.

698
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:25,620
The bus leaves tomorrow morning
at 5:30 a.m. for Fargo.

699
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,318
It waits for no one.

700
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,538
Vance, come on, let's go.

701
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:36,588
Blanca, help Keir
grab some of the stuff.

702
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:40,505
- Why? - Could you just help
us pack up the stuff, please?

703
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,030
Jeez. Bitch.

704
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:46,032
And they say I'm difficult.

705
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,687
Phoebe, should we wait for you?

706
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,995
Oh, I gotta get the releases for
tomorrow's game and stop by the Mini-Mart.

707
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,389
I'll meet you guys
back at the crew cabin, okay?

708
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:57,217
Alright. Be careful.

709
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:12,058
Luke? Nik?

710
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,973
- Um, guys?
- Hello?

711
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:21,676
- Oh, phone's dead. Shocking! - It doesn't
look like Luke slept in his bed last night.

712
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,133
No, and you're right, 'cause
Daphne's bed hasn't been slept in.

713
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:26,725
It doesn't make any sense.
Where the hell's her truck?

714
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:29,249
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Oh!

715
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:33,253
Fucking shit!
Oh, my God!

716
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,475
- Oh, my God.
- Don't touch it!

717
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,868
- Is that Mike's watch?
- Oh, God! What is it holding?

718
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:43,220
It's the fucking microphone we lost at
the cabin. He must've went back to get it.

719
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:46,658
Ew! Oh, my God, that fucking sick
coach must've cut his hand off!

720
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,442
We gotta call the cops!

721
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:51,097
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Calm down,
calm down. Check your phones.

722
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,795
Do you have any signal?
Keira, check your phone. Blanca.

723
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,277
- Oh! - Blanca, check your phone.
- Over here. Clients love, love,

724
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,279
love to bitch about problems
on locations.

725
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:02,630
You know, "My wardrobe sucks."
"My trailer's not big enough."

726
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:06,417
Uh... "They're housing me in the
woods." I try not to take those calls.

727
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,289
By the time I return them, they've
usually worked it out themselves.

728
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,030
No signal, nothing.
I have nothing.

729
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,645
What's this?

730
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:23,303
What is that freaking mask?
Who is this?

731
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:26,437
Who cares? Somebody is out
there who thinks it's okay

732
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,048
to chop people's hands off!

733
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:32,181
Oh, God.

734
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:42,061
- My God. That's Daphne.
- What?

735
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,717
I know that sign. That's
out by Coach Hansen's cabin.

736
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,545
We gotta get out there.

737
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:56,684
Guys, we gotta go. She could
still be alive. Come on.

738
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,382
Come on!

739
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:00,514
I can't even begin
to believe this.

740
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:10,611
- Hey! Why are we stopping here?
- I'm gonna go check out this site.

741
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:14,006
I need you guys to stay here and try
to get in touch with the cops, okay?

742
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:16,791
I saw an old C.B. radio
in the principal's office.

743
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:20,708
Tell them to meet me by the Predator
Roundup sign by Hansen's cabin.

744
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:23,537
Oh, okay, so you're just gonna
go hang with the fucking killer?

745
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:25,583
We gotta get back on the highway
and keep driving!

746
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:28,325
I hate to break this to you guys,
but that girl is probably dead.

747
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:31,937
And what if she's not, Blanca? And what if
Nik and Luke and Greg need our help too?

748
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,200
How are we even gonna
get in there? Here.

749
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:36,768
Take these. They gave them to me.
Jake, I'm going with you.

750
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:39,118
Wait, wait. I'm not
going in there by myself.

751
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:41,512
Well, alright, fine.
You're coming with us, then.

752
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:43,296
Both of those choices suck!

753
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,429
Well, Blanca, please pick one!

754
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:49,868
Ugh! Fine, I'll stay here, but I'm taking
your dog, so you have to come back for me.

755
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:52,871
We are gonna come back. Just go find
that C.B. radio and get us some help.

756
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:54,873
And hey, hey, take this.

757
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,440
Oh.

758
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:35,217
Hello?

759
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:29,750
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

760
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:48,465
- Anyone here?
- Coach?!

761
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:54,209
Who's back there?
Is that you, Phoebe?

762
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:58,518
- Is that thing still out there? That thing
with the mask? - Mask? Are you on drugs?

763
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:03,828
We've gotta get out of here!

764
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,438
Run! Run!

765
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,832
- Just calm down.
- Run! - Just a sec...

766
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:15,404
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Get in the car! Get in!

767
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,951
This better not be some kind of
hijinks for this television show.

768
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:24,849
There was a guy in there, in a mask
with an axe, and he tried to kill me!

769
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:28,548
Kill you? You... you're talking
like some kind of crazy...

770
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:55,706
Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?
This is an emergency.

771
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,676
No.

772
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,640
Anyone? Is anybody there?
This is an emergency.

773
00:59:17,728 --> 00:59:19,599
Anyone?

774
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:23,472
Bongo!

775
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:25,257
What are you barking at?

776
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:02,555
Daphne?!

777
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,518
Daphne!

778
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:18,658
What the fuck is that?

779
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:20,312
What?

780
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:33,978
Holy shit.

781
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,027
Okay. Let's get outta here.

782
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,945
Ah! Ow!

783
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:47,295
Fuck! Jake. Fuck!
I got it. I got it.

784
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,646
- Shit!
- I got it. I got it.

785
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:52,692
Keir, we're not gonna be able
to open this thing.

786
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,303
Bongo! Where are you going?!

787
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:58,045
God!

788
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:03,964
Bongo!

789
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,621
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna get help.

790
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,450
Gonna get help and be right back, okay?
I promise.

791
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:14,192
- Okay. Okay.
- I promise I'll be right back. Okay?

792
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:16,542
Fuck!

793
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,892
Fuck!

794
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:42,873
Holy shit!

795
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:46,006
Blanca?

796
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:52,012
My God, what are you...
what are you doing down here?

797
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:54,536
How long have you been
down here for?

798
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,974
I snuck in when that mean lady
came down here,

799
01:01:57,017 --> 01:02:00,586
and then it came in. What do
you mean, "it" came in? It who?

800
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:03,067
He's been watching you
through those cameras.

801
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,417
He's been watching that.

802
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,467
Oh, my God.

803
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:19,561
♪ I love you so much

804
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:22,608
♪ That I could eat your face

805
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:27,047
♪ I love you so much
that I could... ♪

806
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:30,921
Ah!

807
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:39,843
♪ I love you so much...
You saw him do this to her?

808
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:42,454
♪ Well I hope you love me

809
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:46,545
Okay. We're gonna go. Come on,
I'm gonna get us out of here.

810
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:48,721
This way's the quickest.

811
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:03,692
Oh, my God!

812
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:11,004
Oh, God.

813
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,660
We gotta go. Come on.

814
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:30,807
Okay, okay, come here. Listen to me.
I want you to stay right here.

815
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:34,549
I'm gonna get us out of here. I have to get
these keys. I promise I'll come right back.

816
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,377
Okay?

817
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,517
Shit!

818
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,785
- Blanca! - Listen to me, I'm
stuck. Listen. I need you to run!

819
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,571
Start running as fast as you can until
you find somebody that you trust, okay?

820
01:03:56,615 --> 01:03:59,357
And tell them we need help.
Tell them that Jake and Keir

821
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,240
are at Coach Hansen's cabin
and they need help.

822
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,927
I promise I will find you!
Just go!

823
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,667
Go!

824
01:04:17,114 --> 01:04:18,985
Oh, my God.

825
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:56,457
Blanca?

826
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,639
Blanca?

827
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:02,784
Ah!

828
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:06,092
Who the fuck are you?!

829
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:07,920
Ah! Ah!

830
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:19,584
Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.

831
01:06:24,763 --> 01:06:27,679
Okay. Okay. Okay.

832
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,596
Ah! Ah! Ah!

833
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:34,555
Get off of me!

834
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:42,999
- Mike? The fucking sound guy?
- Oh, my God.

835
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:45,479
Hey, hey, hey,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

836
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,873
If you'd just listen to me.
If you just listen to me,

837
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,006
you'll love me
as much as I love you.

838
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:53,052
Don't you realize that I've
done this all for us? For you?

839
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:55,837
I'm the only one
that really cares about you.

840
01:06:55,881 --> 01:06:58,188
Did you care about the people
in the video?

841
01:06:58,231 --> 01:07:01,756
They were gonna tell. That girl
told that cheerleader bitch.

842
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,150
They found our room.
You can understand, right?

843
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:07,023
I'd already started.
I couldn't stop it.

844
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:10,330
Get your fucking hands off her.

845
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,953
Ah!

846
01:07:24,997 --> 01:07:27,454
I went through all this trouble
to make the fucking show for you,

847
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:29,349
you're gonna watch it with me!

848
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:31,786
I've already seen it.
It's a piece of shit!

849
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:35,268
You said you wanted the opportunity
to be taken seriously as an actor,

850
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:37,488
and I gave you that opportunity!

851
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:40,665
Because, believe me, people are
gonna take you seriously now!

852
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:44,016
You look really fucking scared!
Really...

853
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,844
No!

854
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:57,769
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

855
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,129
Vance, for some reason,
had some sort of a, uh,

856
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:13,611
bottle-opener/beartrap opener
on his keychain.

857
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:46,513
You're gonna be alright.
Just sit tight.

858
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,429
- Hey.
- Hi.

859
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:51,127
How you feeling?

860
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:54,130
Oh, this has pretty much been
the worst job I've ever had.

861
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:58,872
How's your leg? Ah, it
hurts, but, uh, I'll be fine.

862
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:01,746
Vance and Connor found me.
Got Blanca to thank for that.

863
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:03,443
Mm.

864
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:05,880
How is she holding up?

865
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:08,231
Ah, as well as could be
expected.

866
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:11,103
Imagine what the press
is gonna do with this thing.

867
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,844
Mm. And what about Mike?

868
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:16,456
Mike's description
matches a police report

869
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,893
of a recently escaped
mental patient.

870
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:20,982
So who knows what to believe?

871
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:34,952
Hold on a second.

872
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:54,277
Wait. What is that?

873
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:57,844
It's a bulletproof vest.

874
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:08,900
- Is it worth it?
- What?

875
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,077

What do I think of what actually
happened in... in White Plains?

888
01:11:35,246 --> 01:11:38,684
My God, I thought it was tragic.
It was... it was... just tragic.

889
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:44,648
And on the other hand, it was some of
my client's best work, you know, but...

890
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,737
what are you gonna do?
And what can you do?

891
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:50,523
We did send flowers.

892
01:11:52,568 --> 01:11:56,573
Not just to Blanca. We sent them to
the families of the dead people, too.

893
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:59,576
You know, I always knew
that sound guy was creepy.

894
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:04,798
I mean, it doesn't take that much time
to hook a microphone to a bra strap.

895
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,758
I was trying to be professional,
but there's a limit.

896
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,108
Uh, I think he should've
just written a letter.

897
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:12,850
I think that would've been...
I think that would've been fine.

898
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:15,331
I think that would've
sort of gotten the point across.

899
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:18,594
Do I think Blanca was
surprised when she won the Emmy?

900
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:22,425
I think she was totally surprised,
yeah, absolutely. I wasn't. Fuck, no.

901
01:12:22,468 --> 01:12:24,949
God, I saw the dailies,
and the network knew it.

902
01:12:24,992 --> 01:12:27,255
I mean, she hit it
out of the park.

903
01:12:27,299 --> 01:12:30,650
Uh, and thank God
that crazy sound guy

904
01:12:30,693 --> 01:12:34,393
left the security cameras rolling because
that... Emmy really drove up her quota.

905
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:37,178
I mean, I'm getting five million
bucks for her to do Hush Hush 2.

906
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:40,094
I've been opening bear traps
since I was a kid,

907
01:12:40,138 --> 01:12:43,010
so it really wasn't
that big of a deal.

908
01:12:43,054 --> 01:12:47,406
Did I... did I get the message from Jake
about finding the hand in the refrigerator?

909
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:49,452
Yeah. Well,
I was trying to listen to it,

910
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,323
but I was getting on a plane
at LAX,

911
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,630
and Hillary Clinton
and the fucking Secret Service

912
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:56,130
had taken over the Lieutenants'
Club, so I was out with the masses,

913
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:58,112
and it's just ear-splitting
in that terminal.

914
01:12:58,156 --> 01:12:59,723
I don't know
how you people do it.

915
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:01,550
Affiliated, uh...

916
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:05,555
has hired me
to direct Hush Hush Part 2,

917
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:08,209
which we all know
is Blanca Champion's next film.

918
01:13:08,253 --> 01:13:10,951
Can we wrap this thing up? 'Cause
I gotta take Montana Moorehead

919
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:13,635

never keep a client waiting, so...
