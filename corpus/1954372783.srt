       I'M SUCH A SKANK.        

240
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:42,794
   <i> Hannah: I DON'T KNOW HOW</i>    
   <i> YOU GUYS PUT UP WITH HER.</i>   

241
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,028
Blaine:                         
HEY.                            

242
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,463
YOU GUYS UP FOR A               
PRE-GAME SHAKE AT THE SHACK?    

243
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,465
      Linda: WOW.               
      SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.       

244
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,867
<i>Heather:</i>                        
<i>YOU GUYS COMING?</i>                

245
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,803
             NO. Y'ALL GO AHEAD.
             I'M ON A DIET.     

246
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,271
   ALL RIGHT.                   
   I'LL SEE YOU AT THE GAME.    

247
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,808
   Hannah: WHAT IS WITH HER?    
   WHAT DID I SAY?              

248
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,076
UH, I DON'T KNOW.               

249
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,744
SHE'S PROBABLY ON HER           
PERIOD OR SOMETHING.            

250
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,945
DON'T EVEN SWEAT IT.            

251
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,047
WHAT DO YOU SAY, UH,            
YOU AND I BE ALL LIKE, HEY      

252
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,883
AND GO BACK TO MY PLACE         
BEFORE THE GAME?                

253
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,653
      UM, I ACTUALLY TOLD       
      LINDA AND HEATHER         

254
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,055
      WE'D GO GET A SHAKE.      
      DO YOU WANT TO COME?      

255
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,758
NO. I'LL PROBABLY JUST GO TO    
MIKE'S AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES     

256
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,493
OR SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?        
LATER, BABE.                    

257
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,495
              BYE.              

258
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:20,899
       CAN WE SAY CHOAD?        

259
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,436
WOULD ONE OF YOU PLEASE         
TELL ME WHO THE HELL GINNY IS   

260
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,971
AND WHAT HAPPENED               
BACK THERE?                     

261
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,910
     UH, I NEED A SHAKE.        
     DIET'S OFF. LET'S GO.      

262
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,149
       ( ducks quacking )       

263
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,690
  HUH, OKAY, SO YOU KNOW HOW    
  SOMETIMES LIKE SERIOUS SHIT   

264
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,859
      GOES DOWN IN THESE        
      LITTLE PODUNK TOWNS       

265
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,694
    AND NOBODY EVER WANTS       
    TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN?     

266
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,462
YEAH. KIND OF LIKE MY           
MOM IS WITH MY DAD.             

267
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,597
            EXACTLY.            

268
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,700
   OKAY, SO LAST YEAR BEFORE    
   YOU MOVED HERE,              

269
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,937
THE PRINCIPAL'S DAUGHTER, GINNY,
WAS KILLED HALLOWEEN NIGHT.     

270
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,605
SHE WAS MURDERED?               

271
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:05,009
        NO. SHE DIED            
        IN AN ACCIDENT.         

272
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,447
IT WAS ALCOHOL RELATED,         
WASN'T IT?                      

273
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,883
THAT'S WHY YOU                  
DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME.         

274
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,384
I MEAN, WHEN WE MET             
BACK IN AUGUST,                 

275
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,886
YOU WERE STILL SO UPSET         
OVER YOUR DAD.                  

276
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,554
IT JUST NEVER                   
FELT RIGHT.                     

277
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,057
      SO WHY DID TINA GET       
      SO UPSET EARLIER?         

278
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,892
   I MEAN, WERE THEY FRIENDS?   

279
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,393
       <i> WE WERE ALL HER FRIENDS,</i>

280
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,963
  AND I GUESS IT'S STILL JUST   
  HARD FOR US TO THINK ABOUT.   

281
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,901
  I MEAN, GINNY WAS ONE OF THE  
  SWEETEST, SOFTEST,            

282
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,003
      MOST GENUINE PEOPLE       
      YOU'D EVER MEET.          

283
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,905
   I DON'T THINK THERE WAS      
   A SINGLE PERSON AT SCHOOL    

284
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,074
   WHO DIDN'T JUST ADORE HER.   

285
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,142
                 HELL, EVEN     
                 TINA LIKED HER.

286
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,978
SHE WAS ON THE CHEERLEADING     
SQUAD, WASN'T SHE?              

287
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,914
THAT, THAT'S WHY GRAVES         
LOOKED AT US SO WEIRD EARLIER.  

288
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,083
       I MEAN, GINNY WAS CAPTAIN
       OF THE JV SQUAD          

289
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,254
 SINCE WE WERE FRESHMEN, AND    
 THE APPLE OF HER DADDY'S EYE.  

290
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,355
                           YEAH!

291
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,190
            THAT MAN USED TO BE 
            ONE EASY-GOING CHAP,

292
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,525
         BUT HE'S BEEN GRIM AS  
         ALL GET OUT EVER SINCE.

293
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,594
YEAH. IT KIND OF                
REMINDS ME OF MY MOM.           

294
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,930
I MEAN, HE SEEMED TO BE HOLDING 
IT TOGETHER PRETTY WELL TODAY.  

295
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,932
                 YEAH. WELL,    
                 SOMEONE HAD TO.

296
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,533
                 OUR BUDDY, BEN,

297
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,769
      DAMN NEAR FELL APART RIGHT
      BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.     

298
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,170
WHO'S BEN?                      

299
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,875
       BEN YOUNGBLOOD. YOU KNOW,
       AS IN RICK YOUNGBLOOD,   

300
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,011
          THE HONKY TONKY FARMER
          DATING YOUR HOT MOM?  

301
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,613
             WAIT.              

302
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,017
  I DIDN'T KNOW RICK HAD        
  ANOTHER SON OTHER THAN MARK.  

303
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,420
  WELL, MARK WAS ACTUALLY       
  A YEAR YOUNGER THAN BEN WAS.  

304
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,188
     BEN WAS IN OUR CLASS.      

305
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,558
     WAS?                       
     WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?      

306
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,793
               AFTER GINNY DIED,

307
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,195
           BEN'S WAGON SNAPPED  
           RIGHT OFF IT'S HITCH.

308
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,464
     WHAT HE MEANS IS THAT      
     BEN WENT TO REHAB          

309
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,566
        AND NOT THE KIND        
        WHERE CELEBS GO.        

310
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,636
 JANITOR FRED FOUND A BUNCH     
 OF DOWNER MEDS IN HIS LOCKER.  

311
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,371
      SUPPOSEDLY, IT WAS        
      WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS MOM'S

312
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,573
PRESCRIPTION PILLS THAT SHE OD'D
ON WHEN SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE   

313
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,608
A FEW YEARS BACK.               

314
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,209
        DIARRHEA MOUTH.         

315
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:45,209
              GOD.              

316
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,880
NO WONDER RICK'S BEEN           
SO SYMPATHETIC TO MY MOM,       

317
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,082
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE HE NEVER    
MENTIONED HE HAD ANOTHER SON.   

318
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,251
  HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO PUT    
  THAT ON HER AFTER EVERYTHING  

319
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,621
Y'ALL WENT THROUGH WITH YOUR    
DAD ANYMORE THAN WE DID YOU.    

320
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,625
       OR MAYBE HE TOLD HER, AND
       SHE JUST DIDN'T TELL YOU.

321
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,226
             PARENTS HAVE A     
             WAY OF HIDING SHIT.

322
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,829
                I'M JUST SAYING.
                OKAY?           

323
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,598
SO, WHERE'S BEN NOW?            

324
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,467
              HE NEVER RESPONDED
              TO THE REHAB.     

325
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,437
<i>HE JUST SITS IN THIS DARK QUIET</i> 
<i>ROOM PAINTING PORTRAITS</i>         

326
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,505
      <i> OF OLD GINNY GRAVES.</i>     

327
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,108
SO HE JUST LEFT HIM THERE       
IN THE NUT HOUSE?               

328
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,576
           IT'S NOT A NUT HOUSE.

329
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,714
    MORE LIKE EXTENDED STAY     
    IF HE WAS SUICIDAL.         

330
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,016
GEEZ, THAT'S HEAVY.             

331
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,518
DO YOU GUYS THINK I SHOULD      
SAY SOMETHING TO MY MOM?        

332
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,621
  DUDE, YOUR MOM BARELY LET     
  YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE AS IT IS.

333
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,457
   HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING 
   TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING LIKE,

334
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,958
            HEY MOM, GUESS WHAT?

335
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,461
   I TOOK SOME DEAD CHICK'S SPOT
   ON THE CHEER SQUAD TODAY.    

336
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,763
       RUNS OF THE MOUTH,       
       REMEMBER.                

337
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,399
 ALTHOUGH HE DOES HAVE A POINT. 

338
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,037
HEY, DID YOU GUYS               
SEE THAT?                       

339
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,008
 I THOUGHT I JUST SAW SOMETHING 
 BEHIND THOSE TREES OVER THERE. 

340
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,442
I DON'T SEE NOTHING.            

341
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,644
       OKAY. NOW, I'M OFFICIALLY
       FREAKED.                 

342
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,279
         CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE,
         PLEASE?                

343
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:08,893
      ( heavy breathing )       

344
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,736
SO, YOU THINK PETER WILL LIKEY? 

345
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,840
<i>AFTER ALL THOSE SLICES</i>          
<i>OF SAUSAGE AT BIGGIE'S,</i>         

346
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,243
   WHAT I THINK IS PETER IS     
   SAUSAGING YOUR STEPSISTER.   

347
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,512
             WHAT?              

348
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,513
            NO WAY.             

349
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,881
<i>Linda: WHY NOT?</i>                 

350
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,650
 VICKIE'S FREE LOVING           
 FEARLESS SCREAMS, "SCREW ME."  

351
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,687
 BECAUSE PETER WOULD NEVER BE   
 INTO A TREE HUGGER LIKE VICKIE,

352
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,757
AND LIKEWISE, VICKIE WOULD NEVER
BE INTO A JOCK LIKE PETER.      

353
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,326
ALL I'M SAYING IS I HAVE        
IMPECCABLE EYES AND EARS.       

354
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,329
 YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE
 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.     

355
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,098
AND NEITHER HAVE YOU.           

356
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,200
JUST BECAUSE YOU BEEN SAVING    
YOURSELF FOR PETER PAXTON       

357
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,703
SINCE KINDERGARTEN DOESN'T MAKE 
YOU SOME DAMN FOOL IN LOVE.     

358
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,305
IT JUST MAKES YOU               
A<i> DAMN FOOL.</i>                    

359
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,907
       THERE'S NOTHING          
       WRONG WITH WAITING       

360
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,974
       UNTIL YOU'VE FOUND       
       THE RIGHT PERSON.        

361
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,145
UNLESS IT MEANS YOU'RE THE ONLY 
VIRGIN LEFT IN HOGEYE HIGH.     

362
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,881
    SO YOU THINK THAT PETER     
    WANTS TO SCREW VICKIE       

363
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,883
 BECAUSE HE THINKS SHE'S EASY?  

364
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,385
NOT BECAUSE                     
SHE'S EASY                      

365
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,720
BUT BECAUSE SEX WITH HER IS     
DIFFERENT THEN SEX WITH YOU.    

366
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,557
SEX WITH YOU IS LIKE            
SHOOTING A BUNNY,               

367
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,293
GUARANTEED TO BE                
GREETED WITH GUILT.             

368
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,428
     WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT      
     THAT TONIGHT               

369
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,230
      WHEN I HOOK UP WITH       
      HIM, WON'T WE?            

370
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,632
HUH, I'LL BELIEVE THAT          
WHEN I SEE IT.                  

371
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,302
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE ONLY    
GUY YOU'RE HOOKING UP WITH      

372
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,371
THIS WEEKEND IS JESUS COME      
CHURCH SUNDAY MORNING.          

373
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,739
    AND YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.     

374
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,441
       YOU HAVEN'T DATED        
       IN OVER A YEAR.          

375
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,743
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S          
A LACK OF BROTHERS              

376
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,045
IN THIS HICK ASS TOWN.          

377
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,750
I DATED A FEW, BUT THEY'RE ONLY 
GOOD FOR ONE THING, THE BOOTY.  

378
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,752
      ( knocking at door )      

379
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:42,820
             ENTER.             

380
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,324
HEY, YOU GUYS MIND IF I CATCH A 
RIDE WITH YOU TO THE GAME LATER?

381
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,159
       BUT YOU NEVER COME       
       TO THE GAMES.            

382
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,329
 WELL, MAYBE I WANT TO SEE MY   
 STEPSISTER IN ACTION FOR ONCE. 

383
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,830
      OR JUMP IN YOUR           
      STEPSISTER'S ACTION.      

384
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,767
      OF COURSE YOU CAN.        

385
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,403
   THE ONLY THING IS WE KIND    
   OF HAD PLANS AFTERWARD.      

386
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,939
  THAT'S FINE.                  
  I CAN FIND MY OWN RIDE HOME.  

387
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,609
 SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THE     
 COSTUME BALL AFTER ALL, THEN?  

388
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:05,843
NOT THIS YEAR.                  

389
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,112
    APPARENTLY, TINA PLANNED    
    A PRIVATE PARTY FOR US.     

390
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,881
       AND WHY HAVEN'T I        
       HEARD ABOUT THIS?        

391
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,450
MAYBE BECAUSE TINA DOESN'T WANT 
THE WHOLE SCHOOL TO KNOW.       

392
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,784
             RUDE.              

393
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:14,785
           OH, SPILL.           

394
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,853
<i>WHERE IS IT?</i>                    

395
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,189
     I DON'T KNOW.              
     SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.      

396
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,492
     Linda:THANK YOU,           
     THANK YOU, THANK YOU.      

397
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,760
Krissey: YOU MEAN TO TELL ME    

398
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,129
YOU HAD YOUR HANDS ON OUR       
SCHOOL MASCOT UNIFORM,          

399
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,298
AND YOU DIDN'T BRING IT TO      
COME TRICK OR TREATING?         

400
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,866
         Jeff: SORRY. I HAD TO  
         LEAVE IT AT THE SCHOOL.

401
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,802
          SOMEONE GOT FAKE BLOOD
          ALL OVER THE PONCHO,  

402
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,104
           BUT HEY, IF YOU LIKE,

403
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,640
       I CAN GO GET MY COOL     
       TRAINER T OUT OF THE CAR.

404
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,974
           IT'S JUST DOWN THERE.

405
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,809
THANKS, BUT I NEED              
CANDY COLLATERAL,               

406
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,078
NOT A TRAINER WITH              
SWEATY TACKLES.                 

407
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,848
             YO, SMARTY PANTS.  
             WE ALMOST FINISHED?

408
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,650
                I GOT TO GET TO 
                THE SCHOOL SOON,

409
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,485
           AND I MIGHT NEED     
           YOUR HELP PICKING OUT

410
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,320
           AN OUTFIT            
           RIGHT AFTER THE GAME.

411
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,055
OOH, FOR A GIRL?                

412
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,125
                MAYBE, BUT YOU  
                CANNOT TELL MOM.

413
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,827
WORDS WILL NEVER HURT           

414
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:01,032
PROVIDED WE HIT AT LEAST ONE    
MORE BLOCK OF BIG HOUSES.       

415
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,602
                 HMM, FINE,     
                 YOU GOT A DEAL.

416
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,070
       SUCKA!                   

417
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,106
      THIS IS GOING             
      TO BE A LONG NIGHT.       

418
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,677
    MIKE, WHERE'S THE BOOZE?    

419
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,678
DIDN'T GET IT YET.              

420
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,746
       WHAT? DAMMIT, MIKE       
       YOU SAID...              

421
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,381
BABE, I GOT                     
MY BROTHER'S ID.                

422
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,516
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE             
CARE OF IT LATER.               

423
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,084
      YOU'RE ACTING LIKE        
      IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.      

424
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,519
 WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING 
 TO LOOK OLD ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU 

425
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,087
 WERE HELD BACK FOR TWO YEARS?  

426
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,257
  WHAT ABOUT YOU, BLAINE?       
  DID YOU DO WHAT I ASKED YOU?  

427
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,393
  ONLY THROUGH THE MASTERMINDING
  AND MANIPULATION.             

428
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,361
        IT'S OURS FOR THE NIGHT.

429
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,830
          ( doorbell )          

430
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,536
        Children:               
        TRICK OR TREAT.         

431
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,271
     Girl:                      
     WHERE'S YOUR COSTUME?      

432
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,107
COSTUMES ARE FOR PRE-ADOLESCENCE
AND PERVERTS, PRINCESS.         

433
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,114
   HAPPY HALLOWEEN, KIDDIES.    

434
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,785
            KEYS...             

435
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,289
   AND HAPPY HALLOWEEN, TINA.   

436
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,608
<i>Nancy:</i>                          
<i>HANNAH, COME ON IN HERE.</i>        

437
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,609
<i>YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE.</i>        

438
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,378
COMING.                         

439
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,915
HANNAH, I DON'T                 
WANT YOU GOING OUT              

440
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,817
AFTER THE GAME TONIGHT.         

441
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,919
BIG STORM'S                     
COMING THROUGH.                 

442
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,255
         BUT MOM, YOU SAID      
         AS LONG AS BLAINE      
         HAD ME HOME BY MIDNIGHT

443
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,957
                  THAT I COULD, 
                  I COULD GO.   

444
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,826
HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET        
A CHEERLEADING SCHOLARSHIP      

445
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,764
WHEN YOU'RE HANGING OUT         
WITH A BOY ALL THE TIME?        

446
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,933
    <i> MOM, BLAINE'S THE RUNNING</i>  
    <i> BACK FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM.</i>

447
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,503
             I COULDN'T GET MUCH
             MORE SUPPORT UNLESS
             I DATED THE MASCOT.

448
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,842
   BLAINE IS VERY SUPPORTIVE.   

449
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,945
   SUPPORTIVE OF ONE THING...   

450
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:58,349
GETTING INTO YOUR               
CHEER BLOOMERS, DEAR.           

451
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,950
        MOM, WE'RE JUST GOING TO
        GO TO BIGGIE'S BARBECUE 

452
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,786
              FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

453
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,954
                 NO COW TIPPING.

454
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,790
              NO HOUSE WRAPPING,

455
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,825
             NO MAILBOX BASHING,
             I PROMISE.         

456
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:12,463
      NO. MADE UP MY MIND.      

457
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,865
           MOM,                 
           IT'S HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

458
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,135
         I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU AND 
         DAD GO OUT AFTER GAMES?

459
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:21,305
I COULD'VE CHEERED              
FOR THE COWBOYS,                

460
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,174
BUT INSTEAD                     
I MARRIED YOUR FATHER,          

461
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,775
AND NOW HE'S GONE.              

462
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,477
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU           
THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY         

463
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,013
ON SOME BOY LIKE I DID.         

464
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,982
YOU ARE A GREAT CHEERLEADER.    
YOU ARE THE BEST.               

465
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,619
YOU CAN GO AND                  
BECOME A COMPETITIVE            
JUDGE OR SOMETHING.             

466
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:38,322
TRAVEL THE WORLD,               
DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.    

467
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,191
                   DO YOU REGRET
                   MARRYING DAD?

468
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,527
           I MEAN, DO YOU REGRET
           HAVING ME, TOO?      

469
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,030
NO, YOU KNOW THAT               
I LOVED YOUR FATHER.            

470
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,299
I DON'T REGRET                  
MARRYING YOUR DAD,              

471
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:52,136
AND OF COURSE,                  
I DON'T REGRET HAVING YOU.      

472
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:56,207
EVERYTHING THAT                 
I HAVE DONE IS FOR YOU.         

473
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,642
I MOVED US HERE FOR YOU         

474
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,679
SO THAT YOU CAN                 
HAVE A BETTER SHOT              
AT GETTING A SCHOLARSHIP.       

475
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,014
BUT I'VE HEARD

  A SCHOOL DANCE AFTER THE WAY

    GRAVES TREATED THEM

00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:38,815
   YOU GIRLS ARE GOING TO       
   MAKE ME SO RICH SOME DAY.    

820
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,850
                        SHERIFF?

821
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,986
          THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
          WITH HANNAH, DOES IT? 

822
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,656
NO, NANCY. SORRY.               

823
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:23,893
I, UM, ACTUALLY CAME TO         
HAVE A WORD WITH YOU, RICK.     

824
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,895
IT'S ABOUT YOUR SON, BEN.       

825
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,063
           YEAH. WHAT ABOUT HIM?

826
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,632
BEN?                            
WHO THE HELL IS BEN?            

827
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,068
HIS REHAB HAS BEEN TRYING       
TO REACH YOU ALL DAY.           

828
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,403
IT WOULD APPEAR                 
THAT YOUR SON, UH,              

829
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,338
LEFT YESTERDAY EVENING.         

830
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,408
THE SHRINK SAY HE MIGHT'VE,     
UH, RETURNED HERE ON FOOT.      

831
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,809
I GUESS IT'S SAFE               
TO ASSUME                       

832
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,745
THAT HE HASN'T TRIED            
TO CONTACT YOU?                 

833
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,180
    RICK, YOU NEVER TOLD        
    ME YOU HAD ANOTHER SON.     

834
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,016
               HE'S SICK, NANCY,
               AND I DON'T LIKE 
               TO TALK ABOUT IT.

835
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,852
                HE LIVES IN     
                A CARE FACILITY.

836
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,854
DO YOU HAVE ANY                 
CLUE WHERE YOU SON              
MIGHT'VE GONE?                  

837
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:53,089
I GOT A COUPLE                  
OF MY DEPUTIES OUT              
LOOKING FOR HIM NOW.            

838
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,591
            WHY? WHAT DID HE DO?

839
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,493
HIS SHRINK IS                   
JUST CONCERNED                  

840
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:59,095
THAT HE MIGHT BE                
HARMFUL TO OTHERS.              

841
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,531
NOW, I'VE NEVER KNOWN           
YOUR SON TO BE DANGEROUS.       

842
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,600
PERHAPS YOU                     
CAN ENLIGHTEN ME.               

843
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,202
        YOU JUST TELL YOUR      
        BLOODHOUNDS TO KEEP     
        THEIR DAMN PAWS OFF HIM.

844
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,938
        HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.     
        I JUST GOT TO FIND HIM  
        BEFORE HE DOES ANYTHING.

845
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,441
YOU WOULDN'T MEAN               
ANYTHING HAVING TO DO           
WITH MY LINDA NOW, WOULD YOU?   

846
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,777
       NOW, LOOK HERE, SHERIFF. 
       I KNOW YOU COVERED       

847
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,879
      FOR THEIR ASSES BECAUSE   
      LINDA IS YOUR KID AND ALL,

848
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,781
                BUT BEN DON'T   
                SEE IT YOUR WAY.

849
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,682
          THAT DON'T MEAN HE'S  
          DANGEROUS NOW NEITHER.

850
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:23,052
YOUR SON WAS JUST               
AS RESPONSIBLE AS               
THE REST OF 'EM,                

851
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,623
AND FOR THE RECORD,             
MY DAUGHTER, HEATHER ZANN,      

852
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,626
ROBIN DONALDSON,                
THEY'RE GOOD GIRLS.             

853
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,127
THEY DIDN'T MEAN                
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.               

854
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,729
            I GET THAT, SHERIFF,

855
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,798
      BUT YOU GOT TO LET ME MAKE
      SENSE OF THAT TO MY BOY.  

856
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,302
THAT'S FINE, BUT I              
INTEND TO KEEP MY FAMILY        
AND MY JURISDICTION SAFE.       

857
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,804
             GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
             WASTING MY TIME.   

858
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,138
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?      

859
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,240
       TO CALL MARK AND TELL    
       HIM TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

860
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,876
        YOU GET YOUR JACKET.    
        WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM.

861
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,079
SORRY ABOUT THIS, NANCY.        

862
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,715
JUST KEEP HIM FROM              
DOING ANYTHING STUPID.          

863
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,718
                      THANK YOU.

864
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,670
             WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

865
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,588
WHAT'S GOING ON?                

866
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,693
                  WE SHOULD NOT 
                  BE DOING THIS.

867
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:39,529
DOING WHAT?                     
WE'RE TEENAGERS.                

868
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,197
THIS IS WHAT TEENAGERS DO.      

869
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,868
         AND WHAT ABOUT HEATHER?

870
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,770
             WHY ME AND NOT HER?

871
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:51,374
             I MEAN, SHE'S WAY  
             PRETTIER THAN I AM,

872
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,376
              AND YOU KNOW SHE'S
              IN LOVE WITH YOU. 

873
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,379
I DON'T KNOW.                   
HEATHER'S GREAT.                

874
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,781
SHE'S THE TYPE OF GIRL YOU      
TAKE HOME TO YOUR MOTHER,       

875
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,316
NOT JUST THE PARK 'N PUSS.      

876
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,819
              ( laughs )        
              YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

877
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,053
                 AND WHAT? I AM?

878
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,390
           YOU'RE A BIGGER SLUT 
           THAN I AM.           

879
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:09,792
( laughs ) NO.                  

880
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,528
WE AIN'T SLUTS.                 

881
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,632
WE JUST ROCK STARS.             

882
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,201
                      ( laughs )

883
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,814
THIS SHIT IS THE TITS.

     COME ON. HAVE A BEER.      

904
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,836
YOU GUYS KNOW                   
I DON'T DRINK.

     SHE DOESN'T WANT ONE. OKAY?

           YOU, WATER BOY?

00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,744
HEY, IS THERE SOMEWHERE         
I CAN GO TO CHANGE?

00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:20,857
   Tina: HEY, BABE. WHY DON'T   
   YOU GET THE LIGHTER FLUID,   

914
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,859
      AND YOU AND BUBBA GO      
      LIGHT THE CAMPFIRE?       

915
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,861
          BABE, THERE'S SUPPOSED
          TO BE A CHANCE FOR    
          RAIN TONIGHT.         

916
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,596
BABE, IT'S A 60%                
CHANCE OF RAIN,                 

917
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:28,364
BUT THERE'S 100% CHANCE         
MY LITTLE CHEERGINA             

918
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,100
IS GOING TO BE ALL CLOSED UP IF 
YOU JUST DON'T DO IT ALREADY.   

919
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,003
             OH, COME ON, BUBBA.

920
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,877
     Hannah: OH, IT"S DARK.     

921
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,278
 CAN WE GET SOME LIGHT IN HERE? 

922
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,781
            Tina: YEAH. I       
            BROUGHT TWO KEROSENE
            LAMPS IN THAT BAG.  

923
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,558
SO, WHAT BRINGS                 
YOU HERE?                       

924
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,560
HERE TO SEE                     
SOMEONE SPECIAL?                

925
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,796
                 YOU REALLY WANT
                 TO KNOW?       

926
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,799
          NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

927
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,801
HEATHER, CHECK                  
THAT OTHER BAG.                 

928
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,069
I GOT YOU A LITTLE              
HALLOWEEN SURPRISE.             

929
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,341
TINA, YOU KNOW I DON'T          
LIKE KNIVES.                    

930
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,110
NOT THAT.                       
CHECK THE OTHER.                

931
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,113
        SO I CAN MAKE A         
        JACK-O-LANTERN.         

932

       YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE THE
       ONE WITH ALL THESE RULES 

1047
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:36,232

            STUPID DADDY ISSUES.

1048
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:38,134
     WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO 
     DO TO HAVE FUN AROUND HERE?

1049
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:40,403
YOU KNOW, BLAINE? DON'T         
EVER CALL ME AGAIN. EVER!       

1050
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:41,904
    Tina: OH, JESUS.            
    COME DOWN OFF BROADWAY.     

1051
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:43,572
WHY DON'T YOU MIND              
YOUR BUSINESS, BITCH?           

1052
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:46,742

LOOK, LET'S JUST GO UPSTAIRS    
AND TALK ABOUT THIS. ALL RIGHT? 

1057
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:01,257
I'D RATHER CARVE MY FACE

1072

    WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE.     

1088

1119
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:23,666
             WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1120
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:25,201
Hannah:                         
LOOKING FOR A WEAPON.

1124
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,276
               COULD ANYONE TELL
               WHO IT WAS?      

1125
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:35,811
WHERE DO YOU THINK              
HE WENT?                        

1126
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,546
        NO IDEA.                
        I DON'T SEE HIM.        

1127
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,748
      WE ALL KNOW               
      WHO IT IS, HEATHER.

CRAZY ONE.

            IT WAS HERMAN?      

1133

I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE Y' ALL WERE
PICKING ON HIM THE OTHER DAY?   

1134
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,660
IT'S NOT HERMAN.

       <i> BEN BE DOING THIS.</i>      

1138
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,668
 DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO 
 WITH THE PRINCIPAL'S DAUGHTER? 

1139

1498
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,317
      <i> GET OUT RIGHT AROUND</i>     
      <i> THE TIME I STARTED MAKING</i>

1499
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:26,353
              CARNE ASADA OUT OF
              SENORITA SANCHEZ, 

1500
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:27,988
       BUT A HANDFUL OF         
       THEM HAPPY PILLS,        

1501
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,924
         <i> AND THEN SHE STARTED</i>  
         <i> REALIZING THAT YOU WAS</i>

1502
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:33,327
         JUST ONE STEP CLOSE TO 
         THAT CHEER SCHOLARSHIP.

1503
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,496
THAT'S ENOUGH, RICK.            

1504
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:38,332
WE'VE FINISHED EVERYTHING       
WE CAME HERE TO DO, RIGHT?      

1505
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,101
NOW, HANNAH AND I AREN'T        
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING,          

1506
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:43,337
SO WE'RE GOING TO STICK         
TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN.           

1507
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,006
BEN DID IT ALL.                 
UNDERSTOOD?                     

1508
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,342
      -ALL RIGHT, NANCE.        
      -UNDERSTOOD, HANNAH?      

1509
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,344
              UGH.              

1510
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,579
              MOM?              

1511
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,686
              MOM?              

1512
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,192
I MADE A MISTAKE.               

1513
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:06,560
                MOM, DON'T TALK.

1514
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:09,363
               PLEASE. JUST KEEP
               YOUR EYES OPEN.  

1515
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:12,199
             KEEP LOOKING AT ME.

1516
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,568
I JUST, UGH, OH.                

1517
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,609
I WANTED A BETTER               
LIFE FOR YOU.                   

1518
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,849
                 ( crying ) MOM.

1519
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:31,552
MOM, WAKE UP.                   

1520
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,688
                        WAKE UP.

1521
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:37,157
           WHAT? YOU DON'T THINK
           I'M SMART ENOUGH     

1522
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:40,060
               TO WEAR A BULLET 
               PROOF VEST UNDER 
               THIS HERE PONCHO?

1523
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,663
        YOU RUN ON HOME, HANNAH.

1524
01:21:42,665 --> 01:21:46,066
     I'M GOING TO STAY HERE     
     AND BUILD A BIG OLD BONFIRE

1525
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,068
      STARTING WITH YOUR MOTHER.

1526
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,407
           ( crying )           

1527
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,701
    IF YOUR MOM HAD HALF        
    THE SPITFIRE AS YOU DO,     

1528
01:22:20,703 --> 01:22:23,704
  WE WOULD'VE HAD               
  OURSELVES A REAL GOOD TIME.   

1529
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:25,706
         LITTLE INDIANS         
         ALL IN A ROW,          

1530
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:28,542
      TEN IS ENOUGH             
      JUST WANTING TO GO.       

1531
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,778
    THEY'RE ONLY TEN LITTLE     
    INDIANS, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

1532
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,152
     I THOUGHT I'D ALREADY      
     TAKEN CARE OF YOU.         

1533
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:43,958
BEHIND YOU, ASSHOLE.            

1534
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,804
JEFF, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?        

1535
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,213
      ( ambulance radio )       

1536
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,118
        ALL RIGHT, MISS WALLACE,
        I THINK THAT'LL BE IT.  

1537
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,020
    IF YOU WANT TO HEAD OVER    
    TO THE AMBULANCE THERE,     

1538
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:14,922
YOU CAN RIDE WITH YOUR          
FRIEND TO THE HOSPITAL,         

1539
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:16,757
                 AND WE'LL MEET 
                 YOU THERE.     

1540
01:23:16,759 --> 01:23:19,093
ALL RIGHT.                      

1541
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:21,762
WAIT. DETECTIVE IRONSIDE,       
DID THEY EVER FIND RICK'S SON?  

1542
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:24,431
            YES, MA'AM. WE FOUND
            MARK SAFE AND SOUND.

1543
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,432
          HE'S DOWN AT          
          THE STATION RIGHT NOW.

1544
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:26,500
NO, NOT MARK, BEN,              

1545
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,602
THE ONE FROM                    
THE INSANE ASYLUM.              

1546
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,004
THE ONE THAT RICK WAS           
TRYING TO FRAME THIS ON?        

1547
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:35,075
           OH, UM, I'M NOT SURE.

1548
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,580
           I...I DON'T THINK SO.
           WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK. 

1549
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:47,855
THEN, HE'S STILL OUT THERE.     

1550
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:53,927
           ( music )
