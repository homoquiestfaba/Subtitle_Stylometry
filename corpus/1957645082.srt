big bad Bob feel's something.

4
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,726
I'll call it hungry.

5
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:34,773
Now, what was that, Carly?

6
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,471
Guess.

7
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,082
I don't know, it
was kind of fishy.

8
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,084
You're getting
warm, big bad Bob.

9
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,608
Hey, I get a lot
warmer than that.

10
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,610
I get hotter than a pistol,you just treat me right.

11
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,091
That was salmon
tartare on endive leaf,

12
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:50,659
with a dill garnish.

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,877
Now try this one.

14
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,968
Mm.

15
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,885
Folks, I tell you, itain't steak and potatoes,

but it ain't half bad.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,368
A crab meat salad tartletwith a hint-- just a hint--

18
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,761
of tomato chili chutney.

19
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,328
Mm.

20
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,373

KID 2: Wait up.

32
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:47,063
That was a wicked move.

KID 1: Hey!

34
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:48,934

You!

43
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,055
Could you open the door for me?

00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:31,890
Yeah, whatever.

48
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,168
Ow, ow.

49
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:49,125
Are you--?

50
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,474
OK, be honest, how was I?

51
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,388
Did you get his autograph?

52
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,607
Very good.

53
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,825
You have a very good
voice for radio.

54
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:54,696
Did you get it?

55
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,002
Yes, yes.

56
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:00,310
Oh, oh, he's
something, that bad Bob.

57
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:03,313
Felix the lock-- the lock,you have to unlock here.

58
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:04,836
His voice, every
time I hear him speak

59
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:08,188
I get the feeling of a tingle.

60
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,450
What's he look like?

61
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,712
A warthog.

62
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,192
[SHOCKED] No!

63
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,150
I hear he's being sued
for sexual harassment.

64
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,153
MRS. KOSLINSKI: The man loveswomen, why is this a crime?

65
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:23,290
The issue is consent,
Mrs. K. Excuse me?

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,117
[laughs]

67
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,902
Have we met?

68
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:29,034
He's from the city, somethingabout a license, I don't know.

69
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,254
A license for what?

70
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,734
It's not a restaurant, sir.

71
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:33,604
This is my kitchen.

72
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,215
I cook here.

73
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,217
This facility is also usedfor commercial purposes?

74
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:38,479
No.

75
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,785
Dinner for a few
friends and neighbors.

76
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,571
I'm afraid it's gone beyonda few friends Miss Hunter.

77
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:47,357
We at the licensing bureaualso listen to the radio.

78
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:48,793
It's a giveaway.

79
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,186
It's a promotion.

80
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:53,145
And this is a viable
commercial enterprise.

81
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:59,195
And we will require aGH16/4HW/3 classification

82
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:03,330
F, which you can apply forat the city licensing bureau.

83
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,548
All right.

84
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,941
Well, how much?

85
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,856

I don't have $1,200.

89
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,473
I don't have $12.

at Francesco's.

Oh, yeah.

[MOCKING FRANCESCO] What
you think you don't need

97
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,528
me after all I've done for you?

98
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,400
You'll never survive
without Francesco.

99
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:31,401
He's right.

100
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:32,272
Who is it?

101
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:34,317
It's, uh, Sophie.

102
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,972
I would rather
run a hot dog stand.

103

Sophie?

106
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:42,630
Sophie, calm down.

107
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,502
Well you can't-- don't worry,you can't screw up veal

108
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,722
scallopini, it is idiot proof.

109
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,245
I don't understand.

110
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,029
I did everything you said.

111
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,117
This is not how
I traditionally

112
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:53,641
serve veal scallopini.

113
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,034
Yeah, I- I- I rolled it inthe flower, then I- then

114
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,384
I threw in the
veggies and stuff.

115
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,559
- After you browned the veal?- Browned?

116
00:04:58,689 --> 00:04:59,864
Browned.

117
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:00,909
You mix olive oil
and butter, and you

118
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,345
cook the meat until it's brown?

119
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,216
And then you add the
basil and the stuff.

120
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,392
I thought you did
that at the end.

121
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,132
No.
No.

122
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,787
See, it's difficult to brownthe meat after it's been, uh--

123
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,876
Well, you didn't say that.

124
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,138
I just assumed you knew.

125
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,357
But you're right
sorry, I didn't.

126
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:15,532
It's 20 minutes.

here in 20 minutes.

130
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,886
He's going to
think I can't cook.

131
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:22,757
You can't cook.

132
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,022
All right.

133
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,024
OK.

Why, where are you going?

153

To rob a bank.

00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:19,596
It's fine, just
add the dressing.

157

And listen, don't
forget to boil the water

158
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,426
before you cook the pasta.

159
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,776
No, Carly, you can't gobecause I'll get confused

160
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,125
and I'll just mess it all up.
I know I will.

00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,140
OK, here we are.

185
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,142
[doorbell]

186
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,233
[doorbell]

187
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,103
Coming!

188
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:35,629
Chester?

189
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,587
What are you doing here?

190
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,154
CHESTER: Aren't you
going to invite me in?

191
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,634
CARLY: No, I am not.

192
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,070
I am going to ask you to
please leave my house,

193
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,943
and leave me alone.

194
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,510
CHESTER: Who's he?

195
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,208
Tobias Macneish,
Chester Winnifield.

196
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,993
TOBIAS: Hey, I've
seen you on TV.

197
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:52,907
You're the sex therapist.

198
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,474
That's right.

199
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,736
TOBIAS: What are you doing here?

200
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,085
Actually that's
none of your business,

201
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,695
and if you wouldn't
mind running along,

202
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,829
Sophie and I have a few thingswe'd like to talk about.

203
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,700
No, Chester, we
have nothing to talk

204
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,223
about because we're through.

205
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:08,313
Sophie, please, do
not humiliate yourself.

206
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,794
After all the work we've beenthrough, nurturing your self

207
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,057
image, here you are
once again declaring

208
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,581
yourself unfit for love.

209
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:17,584
I am fit for love,Chester, just not with you.

210
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:23,546
You are so close
to being healed,

211
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:26,114
I don't want to let you slideback into self loathing.

212
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,030
The only person I loathehere is you, now get out!

213
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:32,599
You heard her.

214
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,532
Nobody ever leaves me, Sophie.

215
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,491
I told you that.

216
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:58,973
[gunshots]

217
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,442
How do you know
it was Winnifield?

218
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,444
Well, I saw him.

219
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,402
You know him personally?

220
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,969
Everybody knows him.

221
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,018
He's Got a TV show andbooks and professor passion.

222
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:47,630
Did you know that he andMiss Weston had been involved?

223
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,414
No.

224
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:56,160
But I did know that she wantedto impress Tobias-- um, Tobias.

225
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,988
I was hiding here
in the kitchen.

226
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,819
I don't understand.

227
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,778
[laughs]

228
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,215
She wanted him to think
that she was cooking

229
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:12,089
like Cyrano de Bergerac.

230
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,961
That's not a real person.

231
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,919
I know.

232
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,487
So Tobias falls in
love with your cooking

233
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,619
and thinks it's miss Weston?

234
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,061
All right.

235
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:29,411
You're sure thatWinnifield didn't see you?

236
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,760
He would have shot me too.

237
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,070
OK.

238
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,027
I'm going to have
someone drive you home.

239
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:41,771
I saw it.

240
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,080
I didn't do anything.

241
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,299
I just watched.

242
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,519
[SOFTLY] Hey, don't do that.

243
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
Don't blame yourself.

244
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,132
You did the only thing
you could have done.

245
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,046
OK?

246
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:12,759
CARLY: I'm OK, honestly,
thank you very much.

247
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,108
You've been very kind.

248
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,065
You're welcome.

249
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:15,979
Thanks officer

250
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,806
No problem.

251
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,993
Do you want some tea?

252
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,343
Yes please.

253
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:33,997
You should have seen!

254
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,347
There was this great newsFlash, and then they said

255
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,436
Sophie Westin and the address.

256
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,874
And then I said to Felix,isn't that where Carly is?

257
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:41,788
ELLIOT: Uh, Mrs. K.

258
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,006
Yes?

259
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:43,877
No.

260
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,968
Yes, of course.

261
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,274
Of course.

262
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,408
You poor darling.

263
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,193
You need a little pick me up.

264
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,936
A little drop of gin, huh?

265
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:00,807
Th-- Thank you Elliott.

266
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,429
Here-- I saw some
linguine in the fridge,

267
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,865
do you want me to heat it up?- No.

268
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:16,736
Thank you.

269
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,523
Would you mind just
sitting here with me

270
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,569
a little bit before you go home?

271
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,657
Sure, yeah.

272
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,528
Of course.

273
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:37,757
I didn't do anything.

274
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,109
I just stood there.

275
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,120
Of course I knew her.

276
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,819
She was a client of
mine for three years.

277
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,689
Were you also lovers?

278
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,651
She loved me.

279
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,219
I'm afraid it wasn't mutual.

280
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,612
It's an occupational hazard.

281
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,701
Were you intimate?

282
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,400
No.

283
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,012
She had a profound
self-image problems.

284
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,623
But she was making progress.

285
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,887
And where were you
tonight Dr. Winnifield?

286
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:21,975
The clinic.

287
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,324
By yourself?

288
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,499
With a client.

289
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,109
And her name?

290
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,894
Miss Jeffreys.

291
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,286
Just the two of you then?

292
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,549
My assistant was there.

293
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,769
Miss Lansbury?

294
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,553
Yes.

295
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:38,513
Do you often work at night?

296
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,863
I try not to, but missJeffreys is a new patient,

297
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,431
she wanted to see me, so Itried to accommodate her.

298
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,520
And where did you
go after the clinic?

299
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,175
Came straight home,
poured myself a scotch,

300
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,787
turned on the news, andfound out about poor Sophie.

301
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,310
Do you have any ideawho might have done this?

302
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,186
No.

303
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,061
Why would anybody
want to kill Sophie?

304
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,671
Well, it's usually
either money--

305
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:07,585
Or love.

306
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:11,546
Or love.

307
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,898
Well, I think that's it.

308
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:16,943
Thank you for your time.

309
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,249
Thank you.

310
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,038
Oh, um, you said
her name was Jeffreys?

311
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,343
Ida.

312
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,431
Ida.
OK, great.

313
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,302
Thank you.

314
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,925
TV REPORTER: This car wasseen parked outside the Westin

315
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,841
house, and here in
this WNKW exclusive

316
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,408
we can see the
driver of that car,

317
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,801
believed to be Carly
Hunter herself,

318
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,587
being led away from themurder scene by city police.

319
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,719
However sources close to
Sergeant Jack Brannigan

320
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,634
continue to claim
the cut rate caterer

321
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,332
is not the prime suspect.

322
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,160
The cut rate caterer--

323
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,552
it's started already.

324
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,991
Wait 'til they find
out about Winnifield.

325
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,035
Winnifield's story check out?

326
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,471
Yeah.

327
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,169
He says that he was at
his clinic 'til 9:30.

328
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,736
Confirmed by his personalassistant Allison Lansbury, who

329
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,608
was also there, so she says.

330
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,263
Now her logbook confirms thesession with Ida Jeffreys.

331
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,221
Do you think he's sleepingwith either of them?

332
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,962
I tell you-- I'd say
Ida Jefferies for sure.

333
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,355
But Lansbury is an
old flame, I mean,

334
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,704
I think they'd say
anything he wanted.

335
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,010
But their stories hold?

336
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,446
Yeah, so far.

337
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,231
Five bullets fired, .38
caliber, all recovered.

338
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,754
Now Winnifield owned
a gun, but reported

339
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,278
it stolen two years ago.

340
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:33,019
A .38.

341
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,282
And we've got his palm printsall over the Westin house.

342
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,284
But he and Sophie did someof their therapy sessions

343
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,938
there, right?

344
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,896
Oh, come on, jack.

345
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,332
Give me a motive.

346
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,291
This is Chester Winnifield.

347
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,640
He can have any woman he wants.

348
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,033
Except Sophie Westin,
according to what

349
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,643
Carly Hunter overheard.

350
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,124
So Sophie dumps him, andhis ego couldn't take it?

351
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,082
Maybe he thought it
was bad for business.

352
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,431
No one saw him enter
or leave the house.

353
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:55,693
We have no weapon.

354
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:56,999
We have an eyewitness.

355
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,044
Who admits to being
in the house when

356
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,088
the murder was being committed.

357
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,046
Who had a reason to be there.

358
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,612
Who called the police.

359
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,049
Who has offered to cooperatein any way that she can.

360
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,487
What else do we
know about her?

361
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,011
She did the Cordon
Bleu course in Paris.

362
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,752
Worked in France for
a couple of years,

363
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,798
came back here and got a job asa pastry chef at Francesco's.

364
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,410
I love Francesco's.

365
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,587
Anyway she, uh, left,
uh, had a falling out

366
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:20,849
and started her own
catering company.

367
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,981
Married?

368
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,373
Single, no kids.
Lonely type?

369
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,592
Solitary?

370
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:25,985
Everyone that I
talk to liked her.

371
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,812
Except Francesco, but
he's been in business

372
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:28,900
ever since she left.

373
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:29,814
Plain-Jane?

374
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:30,685
Femme fatale?

375
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,647
I see.

376
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,954
Pretty girl.

377
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,825
Just keep an open mind Jack.

378
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:41,696
Always.

379
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,049
Jack?

380
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,660
It's going to be her
word against his.

381
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,402
If I go into court againstChester Winnifield,

382
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,318
I do not intend to
be made a fool of.

383
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,495
I know, I know.

384
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,107
So this is the first
time you saw him?

385
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,064
I told you.

386
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,587
In person, yes.

387
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:04,936
You were never
a client of his?

388
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,155
No.

389
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,070
No personal
connection whatsoever?

390
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,854
No.

391
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,466
Would you consider
Sophie a close friend?

392
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,858
No, not really.

393
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:15,425
I catered some business
functions for her.

394
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:16,513
I liked her.

395
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,341
Strictly business then?

396
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,995
What else?

397
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,737
I don't know,
what else is there?

398
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:23,999
Nothing.

399
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,392
What are you getting
at detective?

400
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,136
My problem with
Miss Jeffrey's story

401
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:33,052
is that there's no record of hercalling you from her apartment

402
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,270
last night.

403
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,098
Maybe she used a cell phone?

404
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:37,882
Hm.

405
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,188
But if she was at home why wouldyou call you on a cell phone?

406
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,495
More to the point,
why would she lie?

407
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,236
And why would I lie?

408
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,759
I don't know.

409
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:49,068
Unless, of course, I shotSophie and Mr. Macneish.

410
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,113
That would be a reason, yes.

411
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,289
Chester I remind you
you're here voluntarily,

412
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,682
you don't have to answer.

413
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,466
But why would I kill them?

414
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,989
Because she dumped you.

415
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,861
Oh come on, Jack, ifyou want to go fishing get

416
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:03,169
a boat and a bucket of worms.

417
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,996
Why exactly did you
leave Francesco's?

418
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,563
Because he used
cheap ingredients,

419
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,304
and he charged too much,and he didn't pay me enough.

420
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,001
And what the hell does
he have to do with this?

421
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,699
I understand you
threatened him?

422
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:12,917
No, it wasn't a threat.

423
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,876
I smacked him with
a cheese grater.

424
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,095
How long have you
had a gun license?

425
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,100
20 years.

426
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,102
You ever buy a gun?

427
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,713
Once in 1991, it was a .38.

428
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,672
HENRY: You know that gunwas stolen two years ago?

429
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:29,934
I know that it
was reported stolen.

430
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,287
Have you ever owned a gun?

431
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,331
No.

432
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:37,551
I wouldn't know how to use one.

433
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:40,336
You don't honestly believethat I shot them, do you?

434
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:43,774
And Chester Winnifield
is a murderer.

435
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,908
Did you know that there wasno weapon found at the scene?

436
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,128
Oh, don't tell me.

437
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:50,651
They were shot with a .38?

438
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,000
All right, that's enough.

439
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,523
You offered to help
in any way you can,

440
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,177
and now he's trying
to incriminate you

441
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,613
without a shred of evidence.

442
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,398
Henry, they have
an eyewitness.

443
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,400
Somebody who saw thewhole thing, and now she's

444
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,836
blaming me.

445
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,490
He has an alibi.

446
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,360
Well he's lying.

447
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,236
He's too cool.

448
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,280
What about this eyewitness?

449
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,673
Relax.

450
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:15,284
He's yanking my chain,
it's psychology 101.

451
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,764
Oh, god.
There's a mob out there.

452
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:17,634
Let's go the back way.

453
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,419
Henry?

454
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,290
I've got nothing to hide.

455
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,161
OK.

456
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,730
Don't speak to the media.

457
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,254
Don't talk about this to anyone.

458
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:29,646
In fact the best thing ofall would be to lay low.

459
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,126
It's hard to cook
when you're laying low.

460
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,823
I'll arrange for
non-listed number.

461
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,085
I can't have an
unlisted number,

462
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,826
I run a business
out of my apartment.

463
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,524
JACK: Maybe you should put yourbusiness on hold for a while.

464
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:38,481
What?

465
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,004
No, I'm sorry.

466
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,397
I just got this
thing off the ground,

467
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,964
if I put it on hold I
can kiss it good bye.

468
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,880
Hi.
- Who's he?

469
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,404
Elliot Saunders, my neighbor.

470
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:49,405
You live in the building?

471
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,667
Across the hall.

472
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:51,581
OK.

473
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,543
I'll be in touch.

474
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:57,587
No, no, no.

475
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,023
Go out the back way, come on.

476
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:04,594
Maybe I should take home.

477
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,465
No, I'm fine.

478
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,335
Thank you.

479
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,211
FEMALE REPORTER: What about thewoman who was in the apartment?

480
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,995
Is it true that she'saccusing you of the murders?

481
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,388
[interposing voices]

482
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,303
My understanding is
that she is a caterer

483
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,174
who was cooking for Sophie.

484
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:24,614
Now, whether there was somethingmore to this relationship,

485
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,703
or how and involved me I--

486
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:27,791
FEMALE REPORTER: There she is--

487
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,140
[interposing voices]

488
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,316
HENRY: Chester, I
advise against this.

489
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,056
CHESTER: Henry, duly noted.

490
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,319
Don't do it

491
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:34,668
FEMALE REPORTER: Are
you Carly Hunter?

492
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:35,538
MALE REPORTER: Did
Winnifield know that you

493
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,757
and Sophie were lovers?

494
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:37,758
FEMALE REPORTER:
Was it a threesome?

495
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:38,672
What about the bloody glove?

496
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,021
CHESTER: Miss Hunter.

497
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,892
Chester Winnifield.

498
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,372
I know who you are.

499
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,069
Why won't you shake his hand?

500
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,854
FEMALE REPORTER: Yeah, whywon't she shake your hand, doc?

501
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,551
The police say
you saw something?

502
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,944
You know what I saw.

503
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,815
No, I don't.

504
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,339
Why are you blaming me?

505
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,644
Don't you think we shouldbe helping one another?

506
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,037
Eugh!

507
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,038
CHESTER: If we help
one another we could

508
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:00,781
get to the bottom of this, if--

509
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:03,087
For anybody who read mysecond book, Fear of Fantasy--

510
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:09,877
Follow me.

511
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,277
Come on.

512
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:27,764
OK.

513
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:28,765
Let me go first.

514
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,209
OK.

515
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,298
Step up, Carly.

516
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,211
Come on.

517
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:51,614
This way.

518
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:56,576
In here.

519
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,546
What-- what is-- where are we?

520
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,113
In the attic.

521
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:13,114
In the attic?

522
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:20,600
[laughs]

523
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,689
It's--

524
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:23,559
CHESTER: It's OK.

525
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,521
Wow.

526
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,218
Is this what you do when
you can't pay the rent?

527
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,611
Yeah, something like that.

528
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:32,960
Cool.

529
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,961
I'm a cool kind of guy.
Yeah.

530
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:34,875
Yeah.

531
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,355
[laughs]

532
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,752
All clear.

533
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:47,496
All right Thank you verymuch, I really appreciate this.

534
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:48,367
Scoot.

535
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,765
[sighs]

536
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:05,209
[music playing]

537
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:10,867
ANSWERING MACHINE:
You have 25 messages.

538
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:13,217
BOB: Carly, my little
tartlet, bad news

539
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,785
is our three contest
winners all pulled out

540
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,048
'cause of this murder business.

541
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,834
But there's no such
thing as bad press.

542
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:23,924
SID: Carly, it's Sid Harrisfrom the Harris agency.

543
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:27,144
It's crucial we talk
ASAP in terms of putting

544
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,495
together a complete package.

545
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:33,107
LONNIE: Carly, this is LonnieGeffan, I'm a defense attorney.

546
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,631
You've probably
seen me on Heraldo.

547
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:39,200
BELL: Carly, this is BellGiddlesone, we, uh, in terms

548
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,159
of dinner next Friday,
we, uh, well we may

549
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,205
be going to Florida, and, uh--

550
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,947
well, we'll be in touch.

551
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,210
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Sugar,
spice, and everything

552
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,735
nice go in to cookies and cake.

553
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:57,436
Also do fibs and dirty liesdo a dead caterer make.

554
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:00,830
Remember, Carly, you
can run, you can hide,

555
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,354
but you can't get away from me.

556
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,268
ELLIOT: Carly?

557
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,792
[gasps]

558
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,271
Jesus, Elliot, don'tsneak up on me like that.

559
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:08,664
I'm sorry I--

560
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,536
I just wanted to see
if you were all right.

561
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,667
I heard that.

562
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,147
We should call the police.No!

563
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:14,453
It's a crank.

564
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,845
They'll call
somebody else tomorrow.

565
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,630
ELLIOT: That is ridiculous,and you know it.

566
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,154
Listen, Elliot, if I call thepolice they're going to put me

567
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,025
under wraps until
God knows when,

568
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:24,201
and everything that I workedfor will just go up in smoke.

569
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,115
Things will change.

570
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:26,552
Then move in with me.

571
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,945
I m-- I don't mean--

572
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:30,773
for now, at least I
can take care of you,

573
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:33,123
and you can run Carly'screations from next door--

574
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:35,778
That's very sweet
of you, Elliott.

575
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,261
But they haven't driven meout of here, not yet anyway.

576
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,132
OK, I understand.

577
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,439
The offer is always open.

578
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,006
You are so cool.

579
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,573
[laughs]

580
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,183
But it's probably somepsycho fan of Winnifield's

581
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:50,837
just trying to scare me off.

582
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,795
It's-- don't worry.

583
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:53,666
I'm going to be fine, OK?

584
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,102
Well, I'll uh--

585
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,234
I'll just be across the hall.

586
00:24:57,365 --> 00:25:00,020
If you need me just holler.

587
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,934
Help!

588
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,283
[laughs]

589
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,154
Like that?

590
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,025
That would do it.

591
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,679
OK.

592
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:07,506
Bye.

593
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,382
And you've, uh,
checked into all of this

594
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,166
with a fine toothed comb?

595
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:18,473
There were four people in herapartment when Sophie called.

596
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,127
They all confirm her story.

597
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:22,651
So she's got her
alibi and he's got his.

598
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:23,522
Look, I believe her.

599
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:24,435
I know you do.

600
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,351
So do you.

601
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,658
So give me something
or I can't charge him.

602
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,268
Thought I'd takeanother shot at Lansbury.

603
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:32,879
The long suffering
ex-mistress?

604
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,315
If she's lying to
protect him that makes

605
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,664
her accessory double homicide.

606
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,840
Oh, well, she's not
going to betray him.

607
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,581
Not if she's still
under his spell.

608
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,627
Maybe she won't be if she'spersuaded that he really loved

609
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:42,932
Sophie enough to kill her.

610
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:44,673
Hell hath no fury.

611
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:45,935
Something like that.

612
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:47,197
Jack if you're
wrong about this--

613
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,459
I know, I know.

614
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,678
I'll be pounding
the beat in Dubuque.

615
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,419
Just be careful.

616
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,289
Thanks.

617
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,164
MRS. KOSLINSKI: Yoo-hoo!

618
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:58,687
- Mm.
- Mrs. K?

619
00:25:58,818 --> 00:25:59,601
MRS. KOSLINSKI: Hm?

620
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:00,471
Try this.

621
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,434
Mm, mm, needs sugar.

622
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,870
Do you have another
beer, darling?

623
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,351
It's a lemon sauce,it's supposed to be tart.

624
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,179
Hey, come here.

625
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,007
A shocking turn of
events in the Westin

626
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:15,574
Macneish double murder.

627
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,793
After two weeks of intensivequestioning police today

628
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,404
arrested and charged
Dr. Chester Winnifield

629
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,624
with two counts of murder one.

630
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:25,105
The best selling author,TV star, and sex therapist

631
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,759
was taken into
custody at his Forest

632
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,935
Hills mansion just moments ago.

633
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:30,937
Now the key to his
arrest was this woman,

634
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,027
Allison Lansbury,Winnifield's one time paramour

635
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,985
and longtime assistant.

636
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,727
Last night Lansbury agreed toturn state's witness in return

637
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:40,860
for immunity after
police confronted her

638
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,340
with phone records, whichsuggested she had been

639
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,386
lying to protect Winnifield.

640
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,388
Well it was enough for thepeople's primo crime buster

641
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:51,174
Violet Spiri who decided toput Professor Passion on ice.

642
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,915
Now the key to--
- That's you.

643
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,351
TV REPORTER: --this whole caseremains Carly hunter, former

644
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,223
pastry chef at Francesco's.

645
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:59,182
Infamous grazing ground
of the demimonde.

646
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,141
But just who is
this saucy spinster?

647
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,446
This cut rate caterer--
- Cut rate?

648
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:03,752
TV REPORTER: --who's
testimony might get

649
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,102
Professor Passion fast fried.

650
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,670
While some have linked herromantically to both Winnifield

651
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:11,368
and the late lamentedSophie, whatever her motive,

652
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,153
it's Hunter herself
who will soon

653
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:16,286
be on the grill as Winnifieldassembles his legal dream team.

654
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:23,163
I thought you said you andSophie were just friends?

655
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,643
Mrs. K?

656
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,514
It's lies, they're just
making this stuff up.

657
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,950
Don't apologize, my dear.

658
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,519
I know-- my cousin, she
was quite the tomboy,

659
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,130
but a very nice person.

660
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,523
Boy could she hit a baseball!

661
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,660
[ANGRILY] What?

662
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,661
Ms Hunter?

663
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,358
This is detective Brannigan.

664
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,099
Way to go, Jack, you got him.

665
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:46,969
How'd you do it?

666
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,188
The wheel, the rack?

667
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:49,319
Flinstone reruns.

668
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,452
Huh-oh you have
a cruel streak.

669
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,367
Actually I just remindedher that lying to protect

670
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,803
the murder would
make her an accessory

671
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:56,936
and liable to the death
penalty if convicted.

672
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,025
But I didn't press thepoint, I was very polite.

673
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,680
Good manners are always aplus, my mom always said.

674
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,465
So he's in jail?
- At the moment, yes.

675
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,814
Tomorrow's the bail hearing.

676
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,120
OK, he's not getting out?

677
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,730
Not likely, no.

678
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,427
Well that's good, 'causeI've already lost 4 gigs.

679
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,908
I was verbally abused by sixof his fans at the supermarket

680
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,693
yesterday, and my
tires were slashed.

681
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,217
On the other hand I was invitedto a womyn's weekend retreat

682
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:20,089
in Wisconsin, that's womanwith a "Y," me, Ellen, KD.

683
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,700
Well, that's nice.

684
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,181
I said no thank you.

685
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,705
Are you feeling OK?

686
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,576
Maybe you should talk toone of the psychologists?

687
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,534
No, I'm fine, thank you.

688
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:33,015
Now with Winnifield in jail
I'm feeling much better.

689
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:34,495
There's still the trial.

690
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,496
I'm going to testify.

691
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:36,976
I said I would, don't worry.

692
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,717
Oh no, no.

693
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,415
I just meant that, you know,if there was anything that I--

694
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:48,770
I mean we-- the,
uh, police can do--?

695
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:50,511
I'm fine, thank you detective.

696
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,425
OK.

697
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,476
Counselor?

698
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,870
Your honor, counsel's
motion to deny bail

699
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,829
is truly vindictive.

700
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,092
This is a ridiculous
witch hunt brought

701
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:11,662
on by the hysterical delusionsof one, alleged, eyewitness.

702
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,187
But that fact notwithstanding,I can guarantee your honor

703
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,624
the doctor Winnifield
will not flee.

704
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,931
Not only because he
has no reason to flee,

705
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,497
but because he
would never abandon

706
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:23,500
his practice or the peoplewho depend upon him.

707
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:26,199
Now I urge the court
to set the doctor

708
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,723
free on his own recognizance.

709
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,159
Ms Spiri?

710
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,815
Your honor, flight is
not the only issue here.

711
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,730
It's obvious that the
defendant has been using

712
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:38,298
the media to intimidate
our key witness

713
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:40,474
and prevent her from testifying.

714
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,172
We feel that this is furtherreason to deny the defendant

715
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,521
bail at this time.

716
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,219
Mr. Green?

717
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,699
Oh, your honor, nothing couldbe further from the truth.

718
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,094
The public is outraged andthey can hardly be blamed.

719
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:56,229
In fact this alleged eyewitnesswould be in real trouble

720
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,405
if Dr. Winnifield had
not repeatedly urged

721
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,276
the public to remain calm.

722
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,147
JUDGE: Thank you Mr. Green.

723
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,761
The court acknowledges thecharge of multiple homicide

724
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,502
is very grave, indeed.

725
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,547
But the court is inclinedto agree with defense,

726
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,506
that doctor Winnifield
poses no danger

727
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,464
and is no threat to flee.

728
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:18,947
Bail is set at $250,000.

729
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:19,818
Good job.

730
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:27,477
I told you cupcake, there'sno such thing as bad press.

731
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,175
I thought you said
everyone cancelled?

732
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,654
They did.

733
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:33,875
So I just put a little
different spin on it.

734
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,137
BOB: [ON RECORDING]
She was dishing up

735
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,009
a scallopini when
poor Sophie and Toby

736
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,837
went down for the count.

737
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,578
Now Professor Passion issaying it's not just her yams

738
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,232
that are fried to a crisp.

739
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:44,103
Are you curious?

740
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,713
Scared?

741
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,975
Is this the hot pepperyour party needs to sizzle?

742
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,890
Enter now, and you
too could spend

743
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:52,938
an evening with the celebritychef everybody's talking about.

744
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,765
Gee, Bob, that so goodI almost forgot two people

745
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:55,810
were murdered.

746
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:58,073
All this in just three days.

747
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,641
And 90% of them from thetoniest addresses in town.

748
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:04,340
Honey, you're radicalchic for about 15 minutes.

749
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,561
So if I were you, I'd becashing in while I could.

750
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:09,345
And it just gets better.

751
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,825
Sometimes I think I'm blessed.

752
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,261
What?

753
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,002
Bad Bob here boys and
girls, and this just in,

754
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,788
Professor Passion's out onbail, and I'm with you know who.

755
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,356
That's right, the yummyhamster herself, Carly Hunter.

756
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:23,838
Ready to divulge her deepestdoubts, her darkest despair.

757
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,885
Come on Carly, honey,spill your gorgeous guts.

758
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:34,631
[interposing voices]

759
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:57,176
Come on.

760
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,626
God, they replicate.

761
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:13,975
Can't you just shoot them?

762
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:15,411
They don't die, they mutate.

763
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,804
Look, is there
some other way in?

764
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,719
Yeah, turn left at
this corner right here.

765
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,773
CARLY: Elliot, are you home?

766
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:30,774
Uh, yeah.

767
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:39,958
You remember
detective Brannigan?

768
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:40,871
Mhm.

769
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:41,742
JACK: Hi.

770
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,222
So did you hear?

771
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,614
Winnifield got bail.

772
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:45,659
He did?

773
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,008
Who else knows about this?

774
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,140
- Nobody
- Good.

775
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,315
Let's keep it that way.

776
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,710
That looks good.

777
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:03,764
You shouldn't be so rude,Elliott's been a big help.

778
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:04,678
Oh, has he?

779
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,118
CARLY: Oh my god.

780
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:28,919
Never try to tell a lie,when we know it isn't true,

781
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,792
or you'll find out the hardway how to make a caterer blue.

782
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,542
[ringing]

783
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:43,978
Yeah, it's Brannigan here.

784
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,458
Listen I'm with Carly
Hunter in her apartment.

785
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:46,676
There's been a break in.

786
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,548
I want forensics
out here right away.

787
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:50,637
Yeah, and tell the DA
that we need to talk.

788
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:56,686
Witness protection?

789
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:57,731
VIOLET: It allows us
to keep an eye on you

790
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:00,168
between now and the trial.

791
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:01,300
Oh.

792
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,562
That's all?

793
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:04,999
There will be a
few, uh, adjustments.

794
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,913
Yeah?

795
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:06,827
Such as?

796
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,441
We'll, uh, move you to anothercity and change your name.

797
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:16,358
[scoffs]

798
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,751
Oh, that's all?
[laughs]

799
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:19,144
ELLIOT: Just for a few months.

800
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,667
You'll have a bodyguard.

801
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:21,842
Oh, goody.

802
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:23,539
A partner for double solitaire.

803
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,976
VIOLET: It's not as bad
as it sounds, Ms Hunter.

804
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,543
My business?

805
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,676
Think of it as a
well-earned vacation.

806
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:32,983
Well I can't afford
a vacation, Ms Spiri.

807
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:36,639
VIOLET: If you don't testify,we don't have a case.

808
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,076
I know that.

809
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:41,470
So let's try and be creative.

810
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,298
What does that mean?

811
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,821
I'm not moving to
another city and I'm

812
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,606
not going to change my name.

813
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,651
I'm not giving up my business.

814
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:49,652
What about the creative part?

815
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:54,179
I'm getting to that.

816
00:34:58,313 --> 00:34:59,706
I locked myself out
of here one night,

817
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,403
couldn't get that
thing open to save my--

818
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:09,498
Sorry, you were,
uh, you was saying?

819
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,157
Who else has a key besides you?

820
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,115
No one.

821
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,551
I mean, besides the super.

822
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,422
Mrs. Koslinski?

823
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:21,945
What about your boyfriend?

824
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,860
Well, I don't
have a boyfriend.

825
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,254
What about, uh, what'shis name across the hall?

826
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,951
Elliot?
No, no.

827
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:29,039
I mean, he doesn't have a key.

828
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,090
Now that's a brand new lock.State of the art.

829
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:49,234
I want you to log
every call, in and out.

830
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,758
Why don't you put a tap
on the phone, detective?

831
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:53,455
I already have.

832
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:55,718
But nothing is more accuratethan personal observation.

833
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:58,286
Name, time, and purpose of call.

834
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,118
The lock?

835
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:10,864
Needs an iron grate.

836
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:12,518
No iron grate.

837
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:13,388
This is better.

838
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,132
Hungry?

839
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:20,352
No.

840
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:21,788
My breasts!
What?

841
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:22,963
Don't touch my breasts!

842
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,356
Hey, I didn't go near you.

843
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,184
Not me, silly.

844
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,837
My chicken breasts.

845
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,491
Special recipe.

846
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:30,449
Mm.

847
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:31,363
The secret is cumin--

848
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:32,277
[door creaks]

849
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,235
--and lemon wash.

850
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,410
Lighten up, detective.

851
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,249
Freeze!

852
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,251
[screams] Police!

853
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,687
He's got a gun!

854
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,298
[screams]

855
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:54,168
He's got a gun!

856
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,735
He's got a gun!

857
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:56,692
Stop it!

858
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:57,737
He is the police.

859
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:58,651
Who is she?

860
00:36:58,781 --> 00:36:59,565
My sister.

861
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,522
You're sure?

862
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:01,480
Put the gun down.

863
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,354
How can you tell?

864
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:07,442
What is he doing here?

865
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:08,704
He's a bodyguard.

866
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,184
Detective jack Brannigan.

867
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,794
Then why was he
touching your breasts?

868
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:14,188
Hey, I was not
touching her breasts.

869
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,886
It was the-- the chicken.

870
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:17,757
Oh my god.

871
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:18,714
What?

872
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:20,238
You look terrible.

873
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,543
Oh, sweetie.

874
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,066
Are you all right?

875
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:24,024
I'm fine.

876
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:24,938
All right.

877
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,635
Listen, listen.

878
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:27,984
I want you to know
that whatever went

879
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,247
on between you and Sophie--

880
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,813
Nothing went on
between me and Sophie!

881
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,598
All right.
OK.

882
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:34,295
In any case, mom wants you toknow that she still loves you.

883
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:35,209
Alma!

884
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,080
And so do I.

885
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:37,994
Where's Stanley?

886
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,387
Who's Stanley?

887
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:41,084
[ANGRILY] Don't mention
his name around me.

888
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:42,695
Not now not ever.
- Oh, lord.

889
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:43,609
Who's Stanley?

890
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:44,610
A beast.

891
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,046
Her husband.

892
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,134
You have a husband?

893
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,483
Jack.

894
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,180
Sorry.

895
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,140
If you don't mind, my sisterand I would like to talk.

896
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,010
Go ahead.

897
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,490
In private.

898
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:56,448
I'm staying right here.

899
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:57,449
What?

900
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:58,667
That's the deal, remember?

901
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,016
The creative part.

902
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:01,409
Instead of witness
protection you get

903
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,106
a bodyguard around the clock.

904
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:05,370
I don't think I need youractual body in this apartment.

905
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,023
Oh, I'm sorry, that
was my understanding.

906
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,677
And that's the deal.

907
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:11,027
Children, children.

908
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:14,030
It's a lovely body,
and I don't think

909
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,336
we need to quarrel over it.

910
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,253
That's him!

911
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,559
He broke in, I saw
it on the video.

912
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:21,908
You're right, he--
he's the one they

913
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,388
call the dangerous offender.Don't shoot!

914
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:24,389
Oh my god.

915
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,346
Help!

[interposing voices]

917
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,436
Stop, stop.
He's the police.

918
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,350
He's what?

919
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:30,525
Detective Brannigan.

920
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,224
I-- I'm going to
replace the locks.

921
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,488
Better you give me themoney and Felix can do it.

922
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:38,881
Uh, I don't think
so, if you don't mind.

923
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:41,580
Carly, I just saw Winnifieldon extreme close up.

924
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,277
He says you're
suffering from isolation

925
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:44,757
and abandonment syndrome.

926
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,149
He offered to treat you.

927
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,716
Oh, you poor dear.

928
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,631
The only thing I'msuffering from is Winnifield.

929
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:55,115
Ms Hunter, I can't protect youif anybody can just walk right

930
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:56,159
in here any time they want.

931
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,596
This isn't just anybody.

932
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,641
These are my neighbors,
they're my friends.

933
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,208
Well, that's going
to have to change.

934
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,949
Excuse me.

935
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,951
Everyone, I'd really appreciateit if you could just leave.

936

[interposing voices]

937
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:06,996
Hello?

938
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:07,867
Is there any other kind?

939
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:08,781
Hello!

940
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:11,784
Everybody out, let's go!

941
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:13,002
I'm sorry.

942
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,004
Just this time,
if you don't mind.

943
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:16,702
Carly, if there's
anything I can do--

944
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:17,572
She's fine.

945
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:21,750
Thanks, Elliot.

946
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,230
Excuse me, thank you.

947
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,144
Goodbye.

948
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,015
Yes, thank you.

949
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:26,886
Thank you very much.

950
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:34,154
Where's she going to stay?

951
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:35,068
The sofa.

952
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:36,025
No, no, no, no.

953
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:37,026
I'm staying on the sofa.

954
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:38,376
No, no, no, no--

955
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:40,073
406 is empty, she
could stay there.

956
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,466
It's right across the hall.

957
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:42,771
Felix get the keys.

958
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,425
She's my sister,
she's staying here.

959
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,645
Period.

960
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,124
I'm staying here.

961
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,343
That's the deal, all right?

962
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:50,910
No more negotiating.

963
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,395
Come on.

964
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,833
[music playing]

965
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:18,764
I found a number in his pocketfor the hot cake hot-line.

966
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:21,331
I thought it was one ofthose fast food franchises

967
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,203
that he was investing in.

968
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,640
And then I get mistress
Helga on the line.

969
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:27,381
You know she's got one
of those telephones

970
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:28,817
where you can see the name ofthe person who's calling in?

971
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,079
Mhm.

972
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,385
Well she's a minute
into her routine

973
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,300
before she figures
out I'm not Stanley.

974
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,258
And I don't want a hot cake.

975
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,738
He's a beast.

976
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:38,653
Hey, at least it
was just on the phone.

977
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,089
What?

978
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,484
Carly, it's the lying
that hurts the most.

979
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,747
I mean what else
has he been up to?

980
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,749
The bridge of trust
has been burned.

981
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:55,583
Anyway, momma wanted
me to come up here

982
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:56,802
and see how you were doing.

983
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:57,759
Oh, I'm fine.

984
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,978
Are you sure?

985
00:40:59,108 --> 00:40:59,892
Yeah.

986
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:04,853
It's just the way the mediatwists everything around

987
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:08,204
like Winnifield's thevictim and I'm the bad guy,

988
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,990
and nobody gives a damn
about Sophie and Tobias.

989
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,298
Listen, mom worries
about you being alone.

990
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:19,041
Well, tell her that I'vegot my own personal bodyguard.

991
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:21,261
Should I tell her he's
got the hots for you?

992
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:22,175
Brannigan?

Christ, so serious.

998
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:34,970
He has got a
serious crush on you.

999
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,756
For all we know he's probablymarried, he's got 14 kids.

1000
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,584
Oh, no.
He's single.

1001
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:43,326
I can spot a single
guy at 50 paces.

1002
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,546

1003

All right, I'll go with you.

and California wine.

1019
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:17,622
Oh that's good, uh, you
can do the cooking here,

1020
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:19,188
we'll send it over with
one of my officers.

1021
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:20,581
What?

1022
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:21,495
When you're up they're
just going to have

1023
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,714
to serve food and drinks?

1024
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:23,889
You said it was
a buffet right,

1025
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:25,238
they can serve themselves.

1026
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:26,500
No, no, no, jack,
that's not how it works.

1027
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:27,806
I go with the food,
that's the deal.

1028
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:29,459
And Elma can help me serve.

1029

What?

1031
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,202
Look, it's too
risky, all right?

1032
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,552
We don't know the house.

1033
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:35,727
We don't know who's
going to be there.

1034

you can reschedule.

1085
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:41,722
Ah.

1086
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:43,637
You dumped those pastriesdown that woman's dress

1087
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:45,247
and now you've goteveryone hot and bothered.

1088

Forget it, I'm no

What's the big deal?

1090
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,426
Just undo a few buttons.

1091
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,080
Excuse me, listen, Idraw the line at stripping.

1092

OK?

1093
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:54,082
Now, you know what, that's it?

1094
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:54,996
I quit.

1096
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:57,129
Who said anything
about stripping?

1097
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,218
A couple of buttons, Jack.

1098
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:00,872
You got to give them
whatever they want.

1099
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:02,221
Fine, you take your shirt off.

1100
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,178
It's not me they want.

1101
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:04,571
It's you.

1107

Stop it.

1108
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:13,798
OK, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1109
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:14,842
Listen.

1110
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:15,800
I refuse to go back in there.

1111
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,149
Do you understand me?

1112
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:18,716

No, no.

Don't pout, OK?

1118
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,551
It's not going to work.

I need you.

1122
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,606
Yes, you do.

1123
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,349
So let's be creative.

1124
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:44,393
What does that mean?

1125
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,486
Number one, you start
taking the seriously.

Who says I don't?

1127

And number three, Alma
moves out and I move in.

- Alma stays.
- Alma goes.

1133
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:07,373
- She stays!
- She goes.

1134
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:08,330

We can switch to asparagusspears wrapped in prosciutto.

Not quite.

1216
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:58,212
You were one of his
research assistants.

1217
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,475
You took part in
several of his studies.

1218
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:02,521
It paid for the courses.

1219
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,435
Right.

1220
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:04,914

OK?

1225
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,400
It's hard to meet

1229
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:20,887
I blush.

1230
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:21,975
I-- I get clammy palms.

1231
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,020
I mean, I used to--

1232
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,326
Winnifield, he was a big help.

1233
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:27,589
Made me feel less self-consciousand realized, you know,

1234
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,026
other people were nervous too.

1235
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:30,070
Oh, oh.

00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,593
So that's why you kept in touch.

1237
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,813
It's a follow up
service at the clinic.

1238
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:35,206
So you keep your confidence up.

1239
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,120
That's all.

1240
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,035
It's not a cult.

1241
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:40,559
You manage a
children's bookstore.

1242
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:42,822
Right.

1243
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:48,001
Lots of, uh, limericks
and rhymes, right?

1244
00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:49,959
You think I'mthreatening Carly, right?

1245
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,613
Because I'm the geekyneighbor across the hall.

1246
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:54,051
Well, you want to know
what I think, detective?

1247
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,791
I think you're hassling mebecause you are the one who

1248
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,532
has the hots for her.

1249
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,883
And that's why you don't
like us being friends.

1250
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:01,797
I'm in your way.

1251

00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:16,551
What did they even
enter contest for?

1257
00:51:16,682 --> 00:51:18,466
Because it's free.

1263
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:45,145
Really?

1264
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,016
I'm surprised you didn't
hang him on the spot.

1265
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:01,205
Elliot, I am so sorry.

1266
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:02,380
I don't want to talk to you.

1267
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:08,777
[exhales]

1268
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,575
Look.

1269
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:26,273
He had access to thisapartment and your mailbox.

1270
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,232
He was involved with
the Winnifield clinic

1271
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:30,799
and, in my opinion, he hasvery strong feelings for you.

1272
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,498
Oh well, in my opinion,
he's a very good friend.

1273
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:37,328
And there was no need foryou to bully him like that.

1274
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:40,374
You know, I'm trying to
do the right thing here.

1275
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:44,117
So far it's cost me myprivacy and my reputation,

1276
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:45,771
and now it's costing
me my friends.

1277
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:47,512
All because of a couple ofletters and some crank calls.

1278
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:48,904
Letters?

1279
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,124
Le-- those were death threats.

1280
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,778
Look, you know,
if you would just

1281
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:54,171
go in the witness protectionwe wouldn't have to worry.

1282
00:52:54,301 --> 00:52:55,520
No, you wouldn't
have to worry.

1283
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,174
I wouldn't have a life.

1284
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:58,479
On the other hand,
if I didn't testify

1285
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,698
I wouldn't have to
worry about anything.

1286
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:01,439
No.

1287
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:03,615
No you wouldn't, which isexactly what Winnifield wants.

1288
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,312
I have not had time to
do a complete security

1289
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:06,574
check on the Hodges house.

1290
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:09,969
I'm going to need
another 24 hours.

1291
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:12,972
It's a birthday party
for a nine-year-old.

1292
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:14,887
His birthday is today.

1293
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:15,975
That's where I'm going.

1294
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:19,935
With or without my bodyguard.

1295
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:21,937
[yelling]

1296
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,898
[interposing voices]

1297
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:31,469
What is this crap?

1298
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,513
It's a burger.

1299
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,211
Uh, Vietnamese style, sort of.

1300
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:35,908
It's crap, that's what it is.

1301
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,302
I want a burger and fries.

1302
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:40,129
Well this is the food
that your parents chose,

1303
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,087
Christopher.

1304
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,349
I don't care my parents.

1305
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,482
My parents are crap.

1306
00:53:44,612 --> 00:53:45,396
OK.

1307
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:49,400
[sighs]

1308
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,489
Could I borrow your gun?

1309
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,404
Hey, burgers, dogs, fries--

1310
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:54,709
Don't you start.

1311
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,450
I could pick some
up down the street.

1312
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:59,497
No, because the Hodges werevery specific about their menu.

1313
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:01,673
They're not even here.

1314
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:03,283
Ugh, let me help, OK?

1315
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:04,371
I'm good with kids.

1316
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:05,242
No!

1317
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:06,199
Just stay out of it.

1318
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:11,639
[kids yelling]

1319
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:13,598
Hey, hey, hey!

1320
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:14,642
Kids--

1321
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:15,687
[interposing voices]

1322
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:18,603
Get off of him.

1323
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:20,561
We're here to have fun.

1324
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:22,389
Now no fighting, OK?

1325
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,260
Where are the burgers?

1326
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:28,526
I told you those are
way better than burgers.

1327
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:30,005
[kids laughing]

1328
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:32,486
Pelt the maid!

1329
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,445
[kids laughing and yelling]

1330
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:40,451
Oops, sorry.

1331
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:42,583
I can see that you're sorry.

1332
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:43,497
So much for the food.

1333
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:45,282
- I'm hungry.
- Tough.

1334
00:54:45,412 --> 00:54:46,979
OK, I guess I'll
have to eat dirt.

1335
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:52,550
Christopher.

1336
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,422
I have to eat something.

1337
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:56,858
Christopher?

1338
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,295
[screams]

1339
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,168
KID: Get her, get her!

1340
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,648
Get away from me!

1341
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,127
[kids laughing]

1342
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:06,999
Happy birthday.

1343
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:08,435
Do you know what this is?

1344
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:09,741
I got one of those too.

1345
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:11,090
At the joke store.

1346
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,047
[laughs]

1347
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:15,529
206 here, detective Brannigan.

1348
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,835
Great actor.

1349
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:19,141
I'm at 311 Seaton Street.

1350
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:20,795
I have a juvenile in custody.

1351
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,971
I've got obstructing justiceand disturbing the peace.

1352
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:31,240
FEMALE DISPATCHER: [ON RADIO]Roger 206, please advise.

1353
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:32,677
I'm going to try and
sort this out myself,

1354
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:35,419
but you better stand by
to notify Juvie Hall.

1355
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:40,685
FEMALE DISPATCHER:
[ON RADIO] Roger 206.

1356
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:45,690
Do you know what disturbingthe peace is, Christopher?

1357
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,213
Obstructing justice?

1358
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,214
No?

1359
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,302
Well, a smart alec like you?

1360
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:50,782
Well, that's OK.
You know what?

1361
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:52,523
They'll explain
it all to you when

1362
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:53,915
we take you down to Juvie hallyou know what Juvie hall is,

1363
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:55,743
don't you?

1364
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:58,529
It's prison for bad little boyswho don't do what they're told.

1365
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:05,144
Are you reading me, Christopher?

1366
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:13,544
[sigh]

1367
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:16,634
They're opening presents.

1368
00:56:16,764 --> 00:56:18,070
Everything under control?

1369
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:18,940
They're afraid to speak.

1370
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:19,854
[laughs]

1371
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:21,116
That's great.

1372
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,335
See, I told you,
I'm good with kids.

1373
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:23,510
Ah ha.

1374
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:25,425
So are you that nice with women?

1375
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:26,992
Ah, even nicer.

1376
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:28,733
It's hard to imagine.

1377
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:31,562
I know Hey, I'm just
an old fashioned guy.

1378
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:32,476
No kidding.

1379
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,216
Excuse me.

1380
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:35,479
This here--

1381
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:42,529
Was that OK?

1382
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,401
Um, yeah.
Um, felt OK.

1383
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,190
Um, Carly um--

1384
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,365
I don't think that--

1385
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:53,627
you know, we should--

1386
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:00,112
What is going on here?

1387
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:02,375
Mr. Hodges, you're--
you're back early.

1388
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,811
Is this your idea
of suitable behavior

1389
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:04,769
in front of young children?

1390
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:05,770
It's him.

1391
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,032
He was going to shoot me.

1392
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:09,251
You threatened my son?

1393
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:11,340
I exercised appropriate
adult authority,

1394
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,604
he was out of control.

1395
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,214
They were getting
a little restless.

1396
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,738
And she tried to make useat all this foreign junk.

1397
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,958
I told you I wanted properfood for these children.

1398
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,612
Well, see, they
wanted hot dogs.

1399
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,005
And you specifically saidno hot dogs, no hamburgers,

1400
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:25,050
and no French fries.

1401
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:25,877
Don't tell me what I said.

1402
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:27,052
I know what I said.

1403
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:28,575
Hey, hey, hey.
Just-- just relax.

1404
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:29,881
And don't-- keep
your hands off of me.

1405
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:31,491
Smash him, dad.

1406
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:34,233
Look, I want you to apologizeto this boy right now.

1407
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:35,974
For what?

1408
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:36,888
I'm Warning you.

1409
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:38,542
Apologize!

1410
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:39,673
That would only be reinforcinghis delinquent behavior.

1411
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:40,631
No.

1412
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:42,720
Smash him, dad.

1413
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,766
Oh!

1414
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:48,943
My hand hurts.

1415
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:49,944
Dad?

1416
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:50,815
Shut up!

1417
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,690
Mm, delicious.

1418
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:57,691
Delicious.

1419
00:57:57,822 --> 00:57:59,388
What's that sauce they use?

1420
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,955
It's, uh, ketchup, mustard,and mayo squished together.

1421
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:02,043
Oh.

1422
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:02,914
I'll tell you, can't beat it.

1423
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:03,784
Can't beat it.

1424
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,441
Do you think he meant it?

1425
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:09,311
What, about suing?

1426
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:10,487
Yeah.

1427
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:12,793
I'm sure he did.

1428
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:16,188
But I think his lawyer
will talk him out of it.

1429
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,017
Given the facts, hisson's behavior, the rat--

1430
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:20,671
[sighs]

1431
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:22,063
The fact that he more orless punched himself out.

1432
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,369
[laughs]

1433
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,023
Well that's your
word against his.

1434
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:26,154
Hey, I've got an eye witness.

1435
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:27,155
No.

1436
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:28,940
No?
[laughs]

1437
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,072
Yes I do.

1438
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:34,075
I'll tell you, some kidsshould be drowned at birth.

1439
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:34,946
That's a little harsh.

1440
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:35,816
You think?

1441
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:37,165
Yeah.

1442
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:39,516
I take it you don't have any?

1443
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:40,429
Nope.

1444
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:46,000
Dedicated bachelor, huh?

1445
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,089
Actually I'm divorced.

1446
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,960
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

1447
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:49,874
I didn't mean to pry.

1448
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:50,875
No, that's-- that's OK.

1449
00:58:51,005 --> 00:58:51,789
Mm.

1450
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:53,312
It was a long time ago.

1451
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,706
I was too wrapped up in my job.

1452
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,360
So you-- you like being a cop?

1453
00:58:58,491 --> 00:58:59,710
Yeah, I love it.
You know?

1454
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,146
Mhm.

1455
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:02,756
And everything's real
and everything matters.

1456
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:04,541
Mhm, right.

1457
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:07,413
It's like the whole
city is your family.

1458
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,416
We're all connected,whether you like it or not.

1459
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,766
You have a--

1460
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:15,464
Oh, no.

1461
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:17,423
OK.

1462
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,337
Did I get it?

1463
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:19,251
Um.

1467
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:12,391
Come on, would you let me in?

1468
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,526
I know you're in there.
- Freeze!

1469
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:19,398
Hey, hey you don't stand, bud.

1470
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:20,965
Oof!

[gasps]

1472
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:23,489
What are you doing here?
- You know him?

1473
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,143
He's my husband.
Arrest him.

STANLEY: Alma, baby, please,I just want to talk to you.

1475
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:29,408
ALMA: You broke my heart.

1476
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:32,106
Six years of trust and fidelity,gone, like dust in the wind.

MRS KOSLINSKI: That's
him, the killer!

1478
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:34,456
Felix, hit him!

1479
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:35,370
STANLEY: Don't hit me.

1480
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:36,458
I didn't kill anybody.

1481
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:37,764
I just want to talk to my wife.

1482
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:39,461
Does it mean to say
you have to scream

1483
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:40,549
at the top of your lungs?

1484
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,986
Forgive me, Alma.

1485
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:43,596
I beg you.

1486
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:44,728
I'll never do it again.They didn't mean anything to me.

1487
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:46,338
They?I thought it was just one.

1488
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:49,558
You're the only one I love.

1489
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:50,472
Please come back to me.

1490
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,217
Get up, Stanley.

1491
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:57,915
You look ridiculous.

1492
01:00:58,045 --> 01:00:58,916
Get up.

1493
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,836
If you're staying
over there, is it OK

1494
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:06,967
if Stanley stays here with me?- No.

1495
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:08,012
What?

1496
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:09,013
She's not staying with you?

He's not staying with you.

1498
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:11,102
He can stay with Felix.

1499
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:12,103
I don't want to
stay with Felix.

1500
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:13,626
I want to stay with my wife.

1501
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:14,975

1511
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,168
It's a wrong number.

1512
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:35,213
All right, I want
everyone out of here.

1513
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:36,170
Except for Carly.

1514
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:37,955
You two, sleep in my room.

1515
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:39,043
Don't argue!

1516
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:39,957
Just go.

1517
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:51,272
Just leave your door open.

1518
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:52,404
Well, you bet I will.

1519
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:53,274
[laughs]

1520
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:56,321
Goodnight.

1521
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,500
And where are you
planning on sleeping?

1522
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,588
Right here, right by the door.

1523
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:06,287
OK.

1524
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:08,072
What's wrong?

1525
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:09,856
Nothing.

1526
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:11,031
It was just Stanley.

1527
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:12,467
Oh, I know, it
was only Stanley.

1528
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,731
I know.

1529
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:15,732
Goodnight.

1530
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:30,311
I'm taking myself of this case.

1531
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:32,531
What?

1532
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,054
I've become
emotionally involved,

1533
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:36,013
and it's affecting
my performance.

1534
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:37,579
I see.

1535
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,061
And which aspect of yourperformance is it affecting?

1536
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:42,497
[scoffs]

1537
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:44,456
OK.

1538
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:47,024
I let her dress
me up as a waiter.

1539
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:48,286
All right?

1540
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,897
I did a striptease
at a dinner party.

1541
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:54,858
I nearly busted this 9-year-oldkid at his own birthday party.

1542
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:58,426
I-- last night--

1543
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:01,516
last night I almost shot
someone because I wasn't

1544
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:03,127
where I was supposed to be.

1545
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:04,781
What's your point?

1546
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:06,695
Point--?

1547
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:10,482
My point is that I am notexercising my best judgment,

1548
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:14,791
and it's jeopardizing
her security.

1549
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:17,445
I see.

1550
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:20,057
All right, just, you know,get someone else, Violet.

1551
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:26,890
No.

1552
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,326
[sigh]

1553
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,849
If I take you off the
case it may spook her,

1554
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,460
and then she may
refuse to testify.

1555
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:33,853
And getting her butt
in the witness stand

1556
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:36,813
is what this is all
about, lest we forget.

1557
01:03:36,943 --> 01:03:37,814
Just do your job, Jack.

1558
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,690
The truth is, you makepeople feel good about sex

1559
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,648
and that's why they don't
want you to be guilty.

1560
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:49,564
Oh, I think it's theopposite that's true, Morton.

1561
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:52,654
Clearly people are bothered
that this woman, uh--

1562
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:55,179
Carly Hunter the, uh, caterer?

1563
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:58,051
--can make an unsubstantiatedallegation against me,

1564
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:01,228
and then the next thing youknow I'm on trial for murder.

1565
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,362
In fact, lately, I
have had to persuade

1566
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:08,018
a lot of people not to act outtheir rage against Ms Hunter.

1567
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,455
Well you see the irony here?

1568
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:14,589
She's accusing me, and
I'm protecting her.

1569
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,202
Sometimes I have to askmyself, why am I doing this?

1570
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:19,072
[laughs]

1571
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:21,466
Oh, god.

1572
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:24,991
Are you sure you
don't want me to stay?

1573
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:26,210
Uh, yeah-- no, I'm fine.

1574
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,689
Thank you.
I'm OK.

1575
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,474
Now, they're going to
get you into that court,

1576
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:31,041
they're going to
twist everything

1577
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:33,565
around until even you won'tremember what you saw.

1578
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:37,569
I'll remember what I
saw, don't you worry.

1579
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,311
You are so stubborn.

1580
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,748
Here.

1581
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,662
I love you.

1582
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:44,532
Aw.

01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,795
Thanks for coming.

1584
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,668
You take care.

1585
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:53,672
Stanley, no more hot cakes,unless I'm cooking them.

1586
01:04:53,802 --> 01:04:54,542
I promise.

Frida Tensor, I know.

dinner and everybody

I want you to reconsiderwitness protection.

Why are you acting like this?

01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:10,417
By Stanley?

1623
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,115
It could have been anyone.

1624
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:15,205
But I wasn't thinking
about that, was I?

1625
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:17,381
Oh, well you took
your eye off the ball,

1626
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:19,122
Jack, shame, shame, shame.

1627
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:20,514
That's right.

1628
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:21,385
That's right.

1629
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:30,307
[interposing voices]

1630
01:07:39,403 --> 01:07:40,752
OK, what am I supposed to do?

1631
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,014
All right.

1632
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:43,711
Um, OK.

1633
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:45,452
We bring the soup in, andRupert the Butler-- that's you--

1634
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,151
stands at the, uh,
head of the table.

1635
01:07:48,281 --> 01:07:51,023
Paulette, the French maid--that's me-- stands at the foot.

1636
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:52,285
Uh, which is which?

1637
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,331
Just stand opposite me.

1638
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:57,551
And then, um, you say--

1639
01:07:57,682 --> 01:07:58,552
you say?

1640
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:00,554
Uh, dinner is served.

1641
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:01,599
And that's what we do.

1642
01:08:01,729 --> 01:08:02,774
We start serving.

1643
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:05,385
And then, when I
get to Mrs. Tensor,

1644
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:08,301
that's when the lights go out.

1645
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:09,737
Then the gunshot.

1646
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:12,697
And then when the lightscome back on again--

1647
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,613
um, oh, Mrs. Tensor's dead.

1648
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,354
Uh, OK.

1649
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:19,791
Soup.

[laughing]

1651
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,534
I hate people who haveserious [inaudible] meals.

1652
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:25,492
It's so shallow of them.

1653
01:08:25,623 --> 01:08:26,493
[laughing]

1654
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:28,060
Well, speaking of meals.

1655
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:36,895
[claps]

1656
01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:37,852
Dinner is served.

1657
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:46,426
[WHISPERING] The other end.

1658
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:47,427
What?

1659
01:08:47,558 --> 01:08:48,428
Serve from the other end.

1660
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:50,648
Oh, sorry.

1661
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:52,432
JACK: Oh, pardon me.
[yelling]

1662
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:53,477
How did that happen?

1663
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:54,521
I didn't even hit the switch.

1664
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:55,479
[gunshot]

1665
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:00,484
My Japanese urn!

1666
01:09:00,614 --> 01:09:01,398
It's priceless.

1667
01:09:01,528 --> 01:09:02,573
MR. TENSOR: Oh, dear.

1668
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:05,053
Bravo.

1669
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,316
Bravo.

1670
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:07,708

Nobody move.

1674
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:21,679
Don't tell me,
the Butler did it?

1675
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:28,076
Nobody move.

1676
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:35,519
What are you doing here?

1677
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:38,304
I told you to stay put.

1678
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:40,350
Stay here.
- But--

1679
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,612
I mean it, Carly, don't move.

You are one
stubborn little bitch.

1684
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:47,895
Freeze.

1685
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:50,158
Do you think maybe
we're missing something?

1686
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,595
Well what are we waiting for?

1687
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:52,465
Let's go.

1688
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:02,693
Drop the gun.

1689
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:03,955
Drop it!

Come on everybody,
they're in here.

1691
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:12,398
What's the problem, detective?

1692
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:13,356
You see?

1693
01:11:13,486 --> 01:11:16,010
It's all part of the show.

1694
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:17,447
[gasps]

1695
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:20,406
Who's that?

1696
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:22,278
That's not Norman.

1697
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:24,802
It's Chester Winnifield.
- Professor Passion!

1698
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:29,110
Games up, WInnifield.

1699
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:30,329
You've been recognized.

1700
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,287
What are you going to do?

1701
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:32,113
You going to kill us all?

1702
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,646
[laughs]

1703
01:11:51,132 --> 01:11:51,916

.38?

1705
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:57,487
Gee.

1706
01:11:57,617 --> 01:11:58,966
You want to bet this is the gunthat killed Tobias and Sophie?

1707
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:16,375
It is better to
have loved and lost

1708
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:19,639
than to have never loved at all.

1709
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,424
Definitely the best one, yet.

1710
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,131
Winnifield had a key.

1711
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:34,480
Mrs. Tensor used to
be one of his clients.

1712
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:37,527
He just let himself in.

He won't get out this time.

1715
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,056
Do you want me to
spend the night?

1716
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,235
No.

1717
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,716
I'd rather be alone, thanks.

1718
01:12:52,846 --> 01:12:53,630
OK.

1719
01:13:33,365 --> 01:13:35,672
Come on, Jack, be happy.

1720
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:38,326
Carly's safe,
Winnifield's going down

1721
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:43,027
and, uh, you might even
end up with a book deal.

1722
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,246
I had six agents call me today.

1723
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:46,334
Ain't life grand?

1724
01:13:52,036 --> 01:13:53,820
Oh, come on, Jack.

1725
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:56,344
The people wished to expresstheir gratitude by taking

1726
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,825
you out for a steak and a beer.

1727
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:00,827
[laughs]

1728
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:02,307
I bow to the
wishes of the people.

Hello?

1736
01:14:58,232 --> 01:14:59,625

Hey Jack, it's Carly.

1740
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:23,910
Uh, could you give me acall, when you get a chance?

1741
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:25,956
Thanks.

Elliot.

1747
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:56,639
Hi.

1748
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:00,643
I saw on the news
about Winnifield.

1749
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:04,603
They-- they got him lockedup, you know, that's great.

1750
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:06,997
I thought you might, uh, giveme a cup of tea, you know,

1751
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:09,434
if, uh, that cop's
off the case now.

1752
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,391
[laughs]

1753
01:16:10,522 --> 01:16:11,697
Yeah, he's off The case.

1754
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:13,699
I would love to give
you a cup of tea.

1755
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,613
Come on in.

1756
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,796
I'm sorry, about Jack.
- Who?

1757
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:25,406
Detective Brannigan.

1758
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:28,279
I'm really sorry about
the way he treated you.

1759
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:29,193
Oh.

1760
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:32,196
I-- It's Jack, is it?

1761
01:16:32,326 --> 01:16:34,590
Well, we did spend a
lot of time together.

1762
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,461
But he's off the case now?

1763
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,550
Well he's off my
case, thank god.

1764
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,683
Well that's good.

1765
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,206
Things can get back
to normal around here.

1766
01:16:45,122 --> 01:16:47,820
I was thinking maybe
we could go out.

1767
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:48,908
- Now?
- No.

1768
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:49,822
Sometime.

1769
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:52,433
I mean, a date.

1770
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:53,521
First thing I
have to do is get

1771
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:55,175
my business back on the rails.

1772
01:16:55,306 --> 01:16:56,612
We could drive up the cost.

1773
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:59,353
Maybe buy some lobsters
and you could cook them.

1774
01:16:59,484 --> 01:17:01,225
I have to go to the bankfirst thing in the morning

1775
01:17:01,355 --> 01:17:03,009
and beg them for mercy.

1776
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,228
You want to do that?

1777
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:05,142
What?

1778
01:17:05,272 --> 01:17:06,447
Go to the bank?

1779
01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:07,971
No, drive up the
coast like I said.

1780
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,015
Just the two of us.

1781
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:15,500
Elliot, I am real tired.

1782
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,198
So let's talk about
this tomorrow.

1783
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:20,810
OK?

1784
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,638
You're not listening to me.

1785
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:23,682
Jack, huh?

1786
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:25,336
You and Jack have a good time?

1787
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:27,381
After everything I did for you.

1788
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:28,687
You didn't need him.

1789
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:29,862
I could of looked
after you just fine.

1790
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:30,907
Elliot-- let--

1791
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:33,692
Oh, but you wanted Jack, huh?

1792

1803
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:13,923
Where am I?

1804
01:19:14,053 --> 01:19:15,751
ELLIOT: You're home.

1805
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,449
In the attic.

1806
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:19,624
I made tea.

1807
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:20,538
Would you like some?

1808
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:24,455
I'd love some.

1809
01:19:31,027 --> 01:19:32,985
You did all this, Elliot.

1810
01:19:33,116 --> 01:19:33,812
ELLIOT: Yes.

1811
01:19:36,597 --> 01:19:37,381
Do you like it?

1812
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:41,472
It wasn't easy
getting all this stuff

1813
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:44,301
up here without being noticed.

1814
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:45,215
I bet.

1815
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,611
Well I need my hands.

1816
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:52,091
No you don't.

1817
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:52,962
No, I tried it.

1818
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:02,972
Why are you doing this, Elliot?

1819
01:20:03,102 --> 01:20:03,842
I love you.

1820
01:20:06,497 --> 01:20:07,237
You never noticed.

1821
01:20:11,241 --> 01:20:12,024
You're right.

1822
01:20:12,155 --> 01:20:15,245
I-- I didn't notice.

1823
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,550
You just took me
for granted, Carly.

1824
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:20,772
And-- until Sophie
got shot, and--

1825
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:22,687
and then you were so
scared you practically

1826
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,385
jumped into my arms.

1827
01:20:25,516 --> 01:20:27,648
So I made the tape.

1828
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:29,868
I wrote those notes.

1829
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:31,348
I'm sorry.

1830
01:20:31,478 --> 01:20:32,218
But it worked.

1831
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:37,920
Until that stupid
cop came along.

1832
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:38,834
Jack?

1833
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:41,358
This is because of Jack?

1834
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:43,316
Come on, Carly.

1835
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:47,190
Don't tell me there was nothinggoing on between you two.

1836
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,191
Jack?

1837
01:20:48,321 --> 01:20:51,542
I-- I was afraid, Elliot.

1838
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:54,284
And besides, he's gone now.

1839
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:55,720
Yes.

1840
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:56,590
He is.

1841
01:21:01,073 --> 01:21:01,813
Carly?

1842
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:10,213
Carly?

1843
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:28,100
JACK: Roses are red,
violets are blue.

1844
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:30,798
Elliot and Carly in
a room built for two.

1845
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:39,068
- You're so creative.
- Thank you.

1846
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:40,373
I've always liked
that about you.

1847
01:21:43,115 --> 01:21:45,509
You know I've always
liked you, right?

1848
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:46,684
Well if you like
me so much how

1849
01:21:46,814 --> 01:21:50,209
come you never said anything?

1850
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,125
Well you're not the onlyone who's shy, you know?

1851
01:21:53,256 --> 01:21:57,390
I mean didn't you ever wonderwhy I don't have a boyfriend?

1852
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:01,220
I guess you're so wrappedup in yourself you never

1853
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:04,093
thought about me, did you?

1854
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:05,137
I guess not.

1855
01:22:05,268 --> 01:22:07,444
No.

1856
01:22:07,574 --> 01:22:08,488
[knocking]

1857
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:09,359
Elliot?

1858
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:18,977
I'm sorry.

1859
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:26,550
If we're going to have
a normal life together,

1860
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,856
then you're going to haveto learn how to trust me.

1861
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:29,727
A little.

1862
01:22:29,857 --> 01:22:30,641
[scoffs]

1863
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:32,643
Untie my hands.

1864
01:22:35,472 --> 01:22:37,039
I want to trust you.

1865
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:40,564
And I want to trust you too.

1866
01:22:40,694 --> 01:22:42,435
So, Elliot, untie my hands.

1867
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:51,792
You're not trying
to con me, are you?

1868
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,146
Oh, it's you.

1869
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:13,814
[grunts]

1870
01:23:17,731 --> 01:23:18,515
You OK?

1871
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:19,995
I'm fine.

1872
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,648
Of course she's fine.

1873
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:22,693
I wasn't going to
hurt her, Jack.

1874
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:23,650
It was just a game.

1875
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:24,738
She wanted it this way.

1876
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:25,957
[ANGRILY] Shut up, Elliot.

1877
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,437
I mean it.

1878
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,700
I wasn't going to hurt her.

1879
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:30,701
You can't prove I was.

1880
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,668
[sobs]

1881
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,196
[knocking]
Come in.

1882
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:48,153
It's unlocked.

1883
01:23:54,855 --> 01:23:56,292
I see you taking
my security measures

1884
01:23:56,422 --> 01:23:58,642
to heart, your door's unlocked.

1885
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:01,906
Well it's, um, it's hard to hearthe doorbell when I'm cooking.

1886
01:24:05,692 --> 01:24:07,390
How's Elliot?

1887
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,869
Not bad.

1888
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,393
Considering he's been
charged with kidnapping,

1889
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,743
forcible confinement, sexualassault and a half dozen

1890
01:24:12,873 --> 01:24:13,874
other felonies.

1891
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:15,267
[sighs]

1892
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:18,531
Poor Elliot.

1893
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:19,532
I feel sorry for him.

1894
01:24:19,663 --> 01:24:21,447
And I don't know why.

1895
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:22,840
Because you're a
kind person who always

1896
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,363
thinks the best of people.

1897
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:25,930
In other words, I'm a sucker?

1898
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,192
No.

1899
01:24:27,323 --> 01:24:29,281
Maybe a bit too
trusting, that's all.

1900
01:24:32,371 --> 01:24:35,635
So what happens now?

1901
01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:37,115
[laughs]

1902
01:24:38,725 --> 01:24:40,988
There'll be a trial and
you'll have to testify.

1903
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:42,294
Well how am I going
to prove anything?

1904
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:43,556
It's his word against mine.

1905
01:24:43,687 --> 01:24:46,255
No, you have an eyewitness.

1906
01:24:46,385 --> 01:24:47,299
Right.

1907
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:48,344
Of course.

1908
01:24:48,474 --> 01:24:49,214
Right.

1909
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:55,177
So I guess your job's done?

1910
01:24:58,702 --> 01:24:59,877
Uh, yeah.

1911
01:25:00,007 --> 01:25:00,747
Yeah, I guess.

1912
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:05,274
I guess it should, um--

1913
01:25:05,404 --> 01:25:07,841
keys back.

1914
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:08,799
Yoo-hoo!

1915
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:10,540
H-- what's he doing here?

1916
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,498
Why aren't you guarding Elliot?

1917
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:14,370
- He's in jail.
- Good.

1918
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,850
After what what he put
dear Carly through.

1919
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:20,985
Oh, to think I nurtured thatviper right under my very roof.

1920
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:21,986
[gasps]

1921
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,161
Any chance of a snack dear?

1922
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:24,206
Felix looks peckish.

1923
01:25:31,038 --> 01:25:31,822
I should get going.

1924
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:36,566
Jack.

1925
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:37,654
Yeah?

1926
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:42,528
Um-- uh, the keys.

1927
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:43,399
[laughs]

1928
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:46,576
Oh!

1929
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:47,577
Right.

1930
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:48,447
Sorry.

1931
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,410
OK.

1932
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:02,766
He is a very handsome man.

1933
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:03,854
Yes he is.

1934
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:05,421
And you're in love with him.

1935
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:06,335
[laughs]

1936
01:26:06,465 --> 01:26:07,597
A policeman.

1937
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:08,728
You poor dear.

1938
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:10,121
Look, stay there.

1939
01:26:10,252 --> 01:26:11,122
Felix, come with me.

1940
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:12,602
Detective!

1941
01:26:12,732 --> 01:26:13,603
Detective!

1942
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,912
Detective, where do
you think you're going?

1943
01:26:19,043 --> 01:26:20,305
Excuse me?

1944
01:26:20,436 --> 01:26:22,177
How could you leave
the scene of a crime?

1945
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:23,090
What crime?

1946
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,962
A B & E.

1947
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:26,355
There's been no B & E, Mrs. K.

1948
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:28,661
Oh, there certainly has.

1949
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:30,359
Felix, break down the door.

1950
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:34,885
See?

1951
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:38,758
A B & E. Write it up.

1952
01:26:38,889 --> 01:26:41,805
You people are completelyinsane, you know that?

1953
01:26:41,935 --> 01:26:42,719
[laughs]

1954
01:26:42,849 --> 01:26:44,460
God, how embarrassing.

1955
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,296
That should hold
for the time being.

1956
01:26:54,426 --> 01:26:56,820
Oh, My son can fix anything.

1957
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:58,822
Oh, come on Felix, time to go.Work's done.

1958
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:00,127
Come on.

1959
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:01,607
You want to stay
for dinner, Jack?

1960
01:27:01,738 --> 01:27:03,435
Sure.

1961
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:05,524
There's enough for everyone.

1962
01:27:05,655 --> 01:27:07,134
Get out of here, Felix.

1963
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:09,398
It's time to go home.

1964
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:10,442
Thank you, dear.

1965
01:27:10,573 --> 01:27:11,269
Some other time.

1966
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:16,709
Very subtle, aren't they?

1967
01:27:20,757 --> 01:27:22,019
I don't know.

1968
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:23,760
I wonder which one I'm
going to kill first.

1969
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,632
Oh, now that
would be homicide.

1970
01:27:26,763 --> 01:27:27,764
I'm a cop, remember?

1971
01:27:27,894 --> 01:27:28,808
Right.

1972
01:27:28,939 --> 01:27:29,592
So what are you going to do?

1973
01:27:29,722 --> 01:27:30,723
Arrest me?

1974
01:27:30,854 --> 01:27:31,594
I might.

1975
01:27:34,336 --> 01:27:36,816
I can't imagine what
Mrs. K was thinking.

1976
01:27:36,947 --> 01:27:40,951
I think she was thinking--try and bring us together.

1977
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:44,520
Well, she's pretty eccentric.

1978
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,435
I think she's perfectly sane.

1979
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,667
What's for dinner?

1980
01:28:01,798 --> 01:28:03,190
Something that will keep.

1981
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:05,671
[laughs]

1982
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:13,157
[music playing]

1983
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:03,555
[laughs]

1984
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,354
