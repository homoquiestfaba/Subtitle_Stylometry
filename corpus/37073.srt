1
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,671
Let go of me!

2
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:53,207
Okay, now I really have a wedgie.
Fred! Velma!

3
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:56,814
Can you guys hurry it up?
This ghost keeps grabbing...

4
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,345
Please!

5
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,747
Jinkies.

6
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,814
Fred. Come in, Fred.

7
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,356
-Fred! Can you hear me?
-Fredster here, Velms.

8
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:12,391
Shockingly, Daphne's been
captured again. That's okay.

9
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:15,158
When the Luna Ghost
rounds the corner with Daphne...

10
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,063
...Shaggy and Scooby will pop out
of the barrel...

11
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:21,569
You'll activate the conveyor belt,
spilling the oil onto the floor.

12
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,370
Just remember my plan.

13
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,812
Like, chill out, Scooby-Doo.
Stop shaking.

14
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,879
Me? That's you.

15
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,745
Right. It's me. Sorry.

16
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,266
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing, man?

17
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,530
Like, this is no time to...

18
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:57,568
Oh, boy.

19
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:01,268
Like, there's a ghost right behind me,
isn't there?

20
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,142
Run!

21
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,853
Go, Shaggy! Go!

22
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:20,589
-Run!
-Like, I'm trying, buddy!

23
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,699
Fred, now!

24
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,064
Hurry up!

25
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:28,562
-I got him.
-Look out!

26
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:30,504
Sorry!

27
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,058
-Sorry, Velma.
-I know, Fred.

28
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,888
-Where's the ghost?
-He's right behind us.

29
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,728
Skateboard!

30
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,712
Is he still after us, Scoob?

31
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,845
Banzai!

32
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:23,518
-Zoinks! Grab the hook!
-Hold on, Shaggy!

33
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,914
Daphne, are you okay?

34
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,285
I'm so over this
damsel-in-distress nonsense.

35
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,477
Where's Shagster?

36
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,946
-Like, I'm right here, man.
-Me too.

37
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:57,720
Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab
another skateboard and do it again.

38
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,419
Yeah.

39
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:19,973
There you go.

40
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:21,675
One for you.

41
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,088
Good-Iooking guy.
All right, nice to see you.

42
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,658
-Thanks for saving the factory.
-Pam, any comments?

43
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:35,026
This is a victory for any celebrity who
wants to make a quality action figure.

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,328
-What's the secret of your success?
-Teamwork.

45
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:43,463
I do a tremendous amount of teamwork,
and I always have a plan. Come on.

46
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,540
Yeah, my plan.

47
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:50,977
I knew from the start there was no
phantom. The Luna Ghost is, in fact...

48
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:57,315
-Old Man Smithers?
-The creepy janitor?

49
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,820
He wanted revenge after you
refused to go out with him.

50
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:04,792
How could you, Pam? I'm a lover-boy
of George Clooney-an proportions.

51
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:10,357
-Fred, how was the ghost able to fly?
-I can answer that. Watch.

52
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:17,775
These balloons fill with a highly
potent helium synthesis...

53
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,934
...giving the Luna Ghost...

54
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,646
...his weightless appearance.

55
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:28,952
I would have gotten away with it too,
if it weren't for you meddling kids...

56
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:32,749
...and your dumb dog!
I'll get you for this!

57
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,324
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

58
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:44,429
Fred, I can't believe you took credit
for my plan again.

59
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,128
Some plan. That ghost pawed me
for an hour and a half.

60
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,740
It's not our fault you always
get kidnapped.

61
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,777
I don't always get kidnapped.
Can't believe you'd say that.

62
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:58,211
Oh, please.
You come with your own ransom note.

63
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:02,283
-My glasses!
-Who's helpless now?

64
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,251
I'm going to kill you, Daphne!

65
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,323
Watch the ascot!

66
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:11,928
You guys, look, I know I'm just
the dude that carries the bags...

67
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:15,464
...but we all play an important part
in this group.

68
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:19,262
I mean, we're just like a big,
delicious banana split.

69
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:22,270
Fred, you're the big banana.

70
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:27,502
Daphne, you're the pastrami and
gum-flavored ice cream. And Velma...

71
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,979
...you're the sweet-and-sour mustard
sauce that goes on top.

72
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:35,012
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

73
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:40,053
You know what, Shaggy? You've really
put it in perspective for me.

74
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:41,555
Thanks.

75
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,958
I quit.

76
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:48,293
-No.
-No way.

77
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,698
You can't quit. I was gonna quit in,
like, two seconds.

78
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,500
Now everyone will think
I copied off the smart girl.

79
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,335
Now, wait a minute.

80
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,078
Maybe I quit.

81
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,810
I do. Yeah, I quit.

82
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,415
I'm out of here.

83
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,248
Good riddance.

84
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,450
Don't...
No. Don't go.

85
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:19,095
Come on, you guys, don't do this.

86
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,292
Please don't go.

87
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,995
Do I quit?

88
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,496
No, Scoob...

89
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,006
...friends don't quit.

90
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,644
It looks like it's just you
and me for a while.

91
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,578
What now, Shaggy?

92
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:44,448
I guess we'll all just do
what we do best, Scoob.

93
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,589
This is primo.

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,861
Man, talk about toasted.

95
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:04,467
Man, the only thing I like better
than an eggplant burger...

96
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:08,578
...is a chocolate-covered
eggplant burger.

97
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,112
With hot sauce.

98
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:18,052
Yeah, just another beautiful day
in paradise.

99
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:22,588
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo." The detectives?

100
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,355
It's probably somebody looking for us
to solve some scary mystery.

101
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:27,588
Nobody home!

102
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,734
Quick, Scoob-o, grab the food-o,
let's scram-o.

103
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,698
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo."

104
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:39,365
Let's go!

105
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:47,578
I'm sorry, dude. I'd love to help you
out. You look like a really nice guy.

106
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,810
We're not detectives anymore.

107
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:53,457
I've been sent by Mr. Emile
Mondevarious to invite you...

108
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,058
...to his amusement park,
Spooky Island.

109
00:08:56,261 --> 00:09:00,595
We don't go near places with "spooky,"
"haunted," or "creepy" in the name.

110
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:05,064
-Or hydrocolonic.
-Right, but that's for another reason.

111
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:10,932
But he'd like you to solve a mystery.
He'll pay you a fee of $10,000.

112
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:14,771
It's just, materialism
is not really our bag, man.

113
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,776
-Free airfare.
-No, thanks.

114
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,506
-Room and board.
-No, thanks.

115
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,708
And all you can eat.

116
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:25,081
All you can eat?

117
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,403
Fred?

118
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:45,565
Velma? Are you going this way?

119
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:52,607
-How have you...?
-Been?

120
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,308
-Yes.
-Great.

121
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,455
I'm on the lecture circuit
with my new book...

122
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:03,656
-...Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me.
-Jinkies, that's impressive.

123
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:05,988
And yourself?

124
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:10,658
I've been working at NASA, developing
hydropowered missile defense systems.

125
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,130
But, more importantly...

126
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,897
-...I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
-NASA?

127
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:19,406
Charter service to Spooky Island
will begin boarding momentarily.

128
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,546
What do you mean I can't have
seven carry-on bags?

129
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,739
-That's so economy.
-Crap.

130
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:31,714
Oh, no. I'm not talking to you guys.

131
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,784
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't it obvious?

132
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,693
We all received the same letter
from one Emile Mondevarious...

133
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,833
...the reclusive owner
of Spooky Island.

134
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:48,233
It's not fair. I was gonna solve
the mystery all by myself.

135
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,237
-And when you get caught?
-I'm a black belt now.

136
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,843
I've transformed my body
into a dangerous weapon.

137
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,137
It's true.

138
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:02,719
Far out. I guess we're, like,
all going to Spooky Island, man.

139
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,377
Where's Scooby?

140
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,519
Hello.

141
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:15,259
Sorry.

142
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,201
They don't allow big dogs
on the plane.

143
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,197
You've got to be kidding.

144
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,401
No one is stupid enough
to believe that.

145
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:30,012
Who's the ugly old broad?

146
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,916
-Say hello to Grandma.
-Aloha.

147
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:36,916
Flight 3774 to Spooky Island,
now boarding.

148
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:39,885
I wouldn't have agreed
to come if I knew.

149
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:43,027
Wait, just think about it
for one minute.

150
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:47,893
Mystery Inc. reunites. We'll be
a team again, just like the old days.

151
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,255
So come on...

152
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:54,769
...let's do that thing where we all put
our hands in, lift them up, and go:

153
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,143
Only if Fred and Velma do it.

154
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,277
People are watching, Shag.

155
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:17,161
Yeah, Scoob, "roo-hoo."
Come on, buddy.

156
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,650
Now that is a beautiful work of art.

157
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,634
Would you mind me taking a seat
there next to...?

158
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,368
To my grandma. That's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma. Like, no.

159
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:12,910
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

160
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:16,277
Bless you.

161
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:23,887
I'm sorry. My allergies.
It's usually only dogs that do it.

162
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,958
-Maybe I'd better move.
-No, wait.

163
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,603
It's probably just
my grandma's perfume.

164
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:37,764
Yeah, even I sometimes get
a little allergic, you know. Oh, jeez.

165
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:43,210
I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go
back and visit with her pal Velma.

166
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:45,041
Right, Grandma?

167
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:46,876
Okay.

168
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,984
Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look
like Scooby Snacks.

169
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,195
I know they're for dogs...

170
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:02,730
...but they're 100%% vegetarian,
and I love them.

171
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,094
Like, me too.

172
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,102
Far out. I've never met another person
who loves Scooby Snacks.

173
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,501
-Me neither.
-I'm Mary Jane.

174
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,605
-Like, that's my favorite name.
-Really?

175
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,803
No way.

176
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,084
Hello.

177
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,794
Grandma?

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,094
Velma, it's simple
behavior modification.

179
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:44,536
To cause a dog to discontinue any
action, flick it on the nose. Observe.

180
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,299
Scoob?

181
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,707
See?

182
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:59,817
Sit, Grandma! Bad, Grandma!
Don't eat the kitty!

183
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,362
Welcome to Spooky Island...

184
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:13,128
...the frightfully popular spring break
spot for college students.

185
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:17,933
Catch our Electrical Torture Parade.
It's a Dead World After All.

186
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:22,010
And the world famous Splatterhorn.

187
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,614
Scooby-Doo!
And the rest of Mystery Inc.

188
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,684
It's marvelous to see you!
How fanta...

189
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,788
I'm sorry.
That's the second time this week.

190
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,153
Thank goodness.

191
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,456
It's a new toy.
I'm just getting up to speed with it.

192
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,826
-Welcome.
-Thank goodness.

193
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,069
I was afraid I'd have
to lug those to the hotel.

194
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,503
That's what Spooky Island's about,
realizing your worst fears.

195
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:55,607
I'm Emile Mondevarious,
the owner of this amusement park.

196
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,004
-You seem less...
-Spooky.

197
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:00,480
...than we'd have guessed.

198
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:04,052
I can be pretty spooky
when called upon. I can go:

199
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,619
Claws and everything.

200
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,487
You wouldn't want to run into me
in a dark alley.

201
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,962
-So you're the one who brought us here?
-No.

202
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,659
What brought you here
was your insatiable appetite...

203
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,701
...for a juicy mystery.

204
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,770
The truth is,
Mystery Inc. is broken up.

205
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:28,571
That's the beauty of something broken.

206
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:31,614
It can be fixed.
Therein lies its potential.

207
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,546
And I need you to fix Spooky Island.

208
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,118
What's the problem?

209
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,814
I believe somebody's casting a spell
on the students.

210
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,391
Now listen and look around.

211
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:47,223
Notice any difference between those
arriving and those departing?

212
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,292
They look like sober, well-behaved
college kids.

213
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,266
Precisely.
They didn't before they came.

214
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:57,100
They've changed.
In other words, a magic spell.

215
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,607
Carol! Carol, how was the island?

216
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,006
Are you tricking on me?

217
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:08,612
It's me, Brad. We've known each other
since we were 3.

218
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,219
Back off my grill, son!

219
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,720
Carol, what are you doing?

220
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:28,966
I'm terrified. The young people
that come off that barge...

221
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,906
...the people I love the most,
they're in danger.

222
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:38,411
-I'm going to solve this one first.
-Not before I solve it first.

223
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:43,053
You'll look like total idiots
when you're captured and I save you.

224
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,846
Thank you. Marvelous.

225
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:49,550
Maybe we can celebrate later
by having a little spookapalooza.

226
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,024
Spookapalooza?

227
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:59,564
You haven't noticed anything unusual
since you started working here?

228
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:04,437
-Any weirdoes running around?
-No.

229
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,355
Welcome, dear victims.

230
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:30,466
My name is N' Goo Tuana.

231
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:35,105
This is my evil best pal, Zarkos.

232
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:40,175
You may recognize him from Telemundo
as the famous masked wrestler...

233
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:41,639
...Zarkos.

234
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:44,178
This enchanted island...

235
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:48,545
...is a thoroughfare
to the supernatural realm.

236
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:54,191
For centuries, it was home to creatures
who lived on the island undisturbed.

237
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:58,959
But then...

238
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,063
...ten years ago...

239
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,860
...Emile Mondevarious...

240
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:10,837
...antagonized these ancient beings
by building a theme park here.

241
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:16,540
The creatures are furious, my friends.

242
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:20,376
And I assure you...

243
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,052
...while you party...

244
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:25,188
...they plot...

245
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:28,723
...their revenge!

246
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:38,424
Do my friends frighten you?

247
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:45,801
They would, if it weren't
for the holographic projectors...

248
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:50,174
...there, and there and there.

249
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:54,313
What a smart little one.

250
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:08,865
Hello, Dead Mike's.

251
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,203
We got a "Mr. Doo" here?

252
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:16,066
I got a call for a "Mr. Doo."

253
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:18,140
Melvin Doo?

254
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,776
No, Scooby.

255
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,447
-Hello?
-Got a bag...

256
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,117
...of hamburgers here for you.

257
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,983
Just walk into the dark,
shadowy part of the forest...

258
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,715
...where no one can see you.

259
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,416
Okay.

260
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:44,398
-Want a stuffed thingy?
-Nobody can win those.

261
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:49,232
Fred says it's a worthless talent, that
I should've learned French instead.

262
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,570
I say you don't need to know what
" Voulez-vous coucher avec moi" means...

263
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,143
...to love that song.

264
00:20:56,347 --> 00:21:01,410
I think being good at crane machine
is way cooler than French.

265
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:04,018
Voilà.

266
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:09,490
Nobody's ever given me a stuffed
dismembered head before.

267
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:38,283
Excuse me.

268
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,859
Now I have to start my voodoo ritual
all over again!

269
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,186
Voodoo ritual?

270
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:48,798
-I was about to sacrifice this chicken.
-That chicken's not alive.

271
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:53,368
I know. What, did you figure that out
when you saw it didn't have a head?

272
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,869
What do you want?
Why you in the voodoo ritual space?

273
00:21:57,074 --> 00:22:02,137
I'm looking for clues as to who's
behind the students' strange behavior.

274
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:05,477
Here's a clue:
Purple is a fall color.

275
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:08,049
-It's the middle of May!
-Pardon?

276
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:11,346
Do yourself a favor
and get off this island. Go home.

277
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:15,514
Go home before evil befalls
your skinny, aerobicized booty.

278
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:17,557
And whatever you do...

279
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:19,888
...do not, I repeat...

280
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:24,125
...do not go into
that Spooky Island castle.

281
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:29,103
-You want me to go to that castle.
-Didn't you hear what I said?

282
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,639
You knew I'd do the opposite
of what you said.

283
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:35,937
You told me not to go to the castle
so I would go...

284
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:38,980
...where you set a trap to capture me.

285
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,548
Unless...

286
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:44,380
...you knew I'd figure it out,
so you told me not to go...

287
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:48,547
...so I'd think you wanted me to go,
so I wouldn't go.

288
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:53,291
I'll find out what you're hiding
in that castle. You watch.

289
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:55,729
What in the world?

290
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,797
Hamburgers, where are you?

291
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:14,717
Hamburgers.

292
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,250
Thank you.

293
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:43,073
Shaggy!

294
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:06,799
It's been really nice.

295
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:10,036
Shaggy!

296
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,506
Monster! Monster!

297
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,302
A monster?

298
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,782
Scooby-Doo, quit goofing around, man.

299
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:26,478
I guess I should go.

300
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,525
Bye, Scooby.

301
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,495
Bless you.

302
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,971
Shaggy. Scooby.

303
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,505
No way.

304
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,182
-Scoob and me don't do castles.
-Why not?

305
00:24:55,385 --> 00:25:00,448
They have paintings that watch you,
suits of armor you think is a statue...

306
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:05,390
...but there's a guy inside who follows
you every time you turn around.

307
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:09,293
-How many times did that happen?
-Twelve. We're not gonna do it.

308
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,297
That's right.

309
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:13,360
Scooby?

310
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,907
Did you hurt your paw?

311
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:22,236
-Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
-Oh, boy!

312
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:26,914
-And you'll be fearless?
-Fearless?

313
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:35,615
Hong Kong Phooey,
watch the fists of fury.

314
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,225
Here you go.

315
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:39,286
Thank you.

316
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:44,628
There's plenty more where that came
from. Let's go before someone sees.

317
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:49,030
You're not gonna stay out here alone,
are you?

318
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:50,971
No, thank you.

319
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:03,379
Oh, boy.

320
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:08,720
This place is, like, uber creepy.

321
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:11,087
Yeah, uber creepy.

322
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:14,492
The only thing missing
is a mindless zombie.

323
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:23,969
Fred, get back. I found this place.
I call dibs on its clues.

324
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,974
-I've already found some clues.
-What?

325
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,571
I followed some weird footprints here.
It might be dangerous for you.

326
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:36,651
If anyone messes with me, I'll open
a can of Chinese whoop-ass on them.

327
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:45,057
-What are you doing here?
-This ride was closed for construction.

328
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:51,167
It's the most likely place to hatch
a plan. And I wanted to scare Daphne.

329
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:55,863
Since we're all together,
let's split up and look for more clues.

330
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,132
-Daphne, you and l...
-Typical.

331
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:00,538
-What?
-Nothing.

332
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,202
-I was always picked last for the teams.
-Okay.

333
00:27:04,881 --> 00:27:07,145
Daphne, exit through the entrance.

334
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:10,081
Velma and I will enter
through the exit.

335
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,949
And Shaggy and Scooby...

336
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,484
...do whatever you guys do.

337
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:35,070
Look at this, huh, Scoob?

338
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
It's like a medieval Sizzler.

339
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:40,213
Pinch me, I'm in heaven...

340
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,875
-It's an expression, Scoob.
-Sorry.

341
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,270
Velma, I never meant to...
Well, you know...

342
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,204
-...pick you last.
-Don't worry about it.

343
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:08,870
I know you.

344
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,214
All you care about
are swimsuit models.

345
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:17,786
Look, I'm a man of substance.
Dorky chicks like you turn me on too.

346
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,191
That's a compliment.

347
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:54,146
Yes! Yes!

348
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:56,053
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

349
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,326
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no!

350
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:03,927
And now for our dinner show.

351
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:05,658
What?

352
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,604
Watch out!

353
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,176
-I got a bad feeling about this.
-Me too.

354
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,013
And now for the main course:

355
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,616
You!

356
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,751
Feast on this.

357
00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:41,661
Jinkies.

358
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:45,408
They're moving toward us. Run!

359
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,877
-We're trapped.
-Quick, try the bookcase.

360
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,777
-One of these has to open a passageway.
-Velma, this is a ride.

361
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:55,780
You got a better plan?

362
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:02,590
What do we do?

363
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,990
Do what we do best, Scoob:
Eat.

364
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,623
It's plastic.

365
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:13,201
So what? You drink out of a toilet.

366
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,934
So do you.

367
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,007
I'm not helpless.

368
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,667
I am helpless. I'm gonna die!

369
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,029
We made it, Scoob. We're alive!

370
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,205
That was weird.

371
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,139
Fred?

372
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,302
Are you all right?

373
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,993
The last book.

374
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:16,426
I don't feel so good.

375
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,263
Reminds me of the time we tried to eat
that guy in the hot-dog costume.

376
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,503
Looks like some kind of school.

377
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,766
In a spooky castle ride? Fishy.

378
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,333
Welcome to America.

379
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:54,231
I am using the language English.

380
00:31:54,404 --> 00:31:56,895
-Shaggy, look.
-Let's check it out.

381
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:06,845
Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action,
huh, Scoob?

382
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:09,281
Now that you're a young adult...

383
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:12,353
...you'll need to learn societal dos...

384
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:14,352
...and don'ts.

385
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:19,752
Interaction between young
people is polite and casual.

386
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,130
Hey, sorry, bro.

387
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:28,360
I will crush your bones into dust.

388
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:35,174
Let's see how the situation
should be handled.

389
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:41,246
Remember, today's young people
have a language all their own.

390
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:45,154
Sorry, bro.

391
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,456
No big whoop, dog.
Catch that new vid on the box?

392
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,719
True dat. I'm up to sniznuff
on all popular trends.

393
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:53,294
Word.

394
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,200
It seems to be a brainwashing
facility of some type.

395
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:03,465
Wherever there's a brainwashing cult,
there's always a power-hungry leader.

396
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,200
-The Papa Smurf figure.
-Mondevarious.

397
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,468
Then why would he have
invited us here?

398
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,188
Jellybeans.

399
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,428
I'll have whatever he's having.

400
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,806
Are you challenging me?

401
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:17,042
Maybe.

402
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:30,321
Pull my finger. Too late.

403
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:39,165
-You're in trouble.
-Oh, boy.

404
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:56,018
I'm not stopping
till your fur is singed off.

405
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,525
We're here to solve a mystery.

406
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:10,063
Yeah, Scoob.

407
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,401
Let's get out of here.

408
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:20,504
Zoinks! Skedaddle!

409
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,076
-I found a neat and scary clue.
-Us too.

410
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:34,051
This is a brainwashing
facility for an evil cult.

411
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:37,455
Maybe this is the secret relic
thingy they worship.

412
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:41,024
We'll all be relics if we don't
get out of here.

413
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:42,596
I got a plan.

414
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:46,263
What's that smell?

415
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,099
Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus.

416
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,874
For your sake, they better not
have gone far.

417
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,775
It is time to summon
the big muchachos.

418
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:04,646
Like, oh, no!

419
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:36,708
Mystery Inc. You all seem rather
cheery. Good news, I hope?

420
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,553
Mr. Mononucleosis...

421
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:43,116
-Yes?
-We have hit a clue smorgasbord.

422
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:47,423
We have three suspects
as to who's behind this evil hooty.

423
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:51,294
N' Goo Tuana. He believes
your park's on enchanted ground.

424
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:55,301
The voodoo man, who tricked me
into going to the castle.

425
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:57,369
-And you.
-Me?

426
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,304
Let's split up.
We'll meet in a half-hour.

427
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:03,673
I'll interview employees to see
if they've noticed anything odd.

428
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,907
I'll translate these inscriptions
Daphne found.

429
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,483
I'll go research cults on the Net.

430
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:14,617
I'm a suspect?

431
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,488
Don't take it personally.
It's because you creep me out.

432
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,656
I see.

433
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:22,954
Fine.

434
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:42,948
Jinkies.

435
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:06,030
Hey. Your friends ditch you?

436
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:09,337
No, I always did the brainwork.

437
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,803
What's this?

438
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:14,479
I believe it's called
the Daemon Ritus.

439
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:17,211
Daemon Ritus? What's it for?

440
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:20,354
This describes
an old race of creatures.

441
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:25,551
It's reminiscent of Pandaemonous texts,
so I can make some of it out.

442
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:30,062
It looks like instructions
to some sort of secret ritual.

443
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:31,894
It is fascinating.

444
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:33,899
On the house. Nice sweater.

445
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,402
You really dig doing this, huh?

446
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:38,597
Like, clues and stuff.

447
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:40,701
Certainly.

448
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:44,574
Really focusing on a mystery
reminds me of the old days.

449
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,842
We were quite a crew back then.

450
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:52,247
That was the best time of my life.

451
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:56,518
Shaggy and Scooby...
What goofballs!

452
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:58,684
Kind of like they are today.

453
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,688
And Daphne...

454
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:06,597
So beautiful. She was the coolest girl
at Coolsville High.

455
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:09,761
Fred. He was so handsome.

456
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:12,533
And he really knew how to accessorize.

457
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,308
Sounds perfect.

458
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,810
Yeah, but every family has one nut.

459
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,381
Scrappy-Dappy-Doo!

460
00:39:20,683 --> 00:39:23,083
Ghosts don't stand a chance with me.

461
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:26,415
Let me at 'em. I'll rack 'em.
I'll sock 'em.

462
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:29,922
For the thousandth time,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

463
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:36,396
Sure there are. When I find them,
I'll give them a dose of puppy power!

464
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:40,231
Oh, God. He's peeing on me.

465
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:49,073
That little egomaniac
had flipped his lid.

466
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:52,214
Scrappy, I told you,
no urinating on Daphne.

467
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:54,976
-It was an accident.
-You were marking your territory.

468
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:59,349
You don't have the scrote for this job.
Listen up, losers.

469
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,253
The time has come to appoint me
your unquestioned leader.

470
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:06,918
Either that, or I'm out of here.

471
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,502
What's the idea? You can't do
this to me. People adore me.

472
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,804
I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl.
I'll get my own show.

473
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:22,107
Puppy power, huh?

474
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,678
And he wasn't even a puppy.
He had a gland disorder.

475
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,725
Help me! Help me!
Monsters! Monsters!

476
00:40:51,707 --> 00:40:54,870
This is the most embarrassing thing
you've done...

477
00:40:55,044 --> 00:40:59,378
...since you cleaned your beans
at Don Knotts' Christmas party.

478
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,675
How many times
do I have to tell you?

479
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:06,914
There are no such things as ghouls,
ghosts, goblins or monsters.

480
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,986
Now listen up. There is absolutely...

481
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,528
...absolutely no such thing as...

482
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,094
Monster!

483
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:24,630
Fred!

484
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,276
Scooby...

485
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,978
Save Daphne.

486
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:39,077
My glasses.

487
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,950
I can't find my glasses.

488
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,228
Help me find my glasses.

489
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:50,798
Here they are.

490
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:53,259
Thank you.

491
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,362
Nice mask.

492
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:57,772
Bad breath.

493
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:02,469
Here.

494
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:11,044
Jinkies.

495
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:14,856
Velma!

496
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:16,747
Come on!

497
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:23,589
Velma!

498
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,593
This is, like, the opposite
of what I wanted to do today.

499
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,836
Leave it!

500
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,854
Stand back, sir.

501
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:50,916
I'll protect you.

502
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:58,494
Mr. Mondevarious!

503
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:02,200
Daphne, go!

504
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:07,704
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

505
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:27,820
Running suitcase.
Run suitcase. Run...

506
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:57,620
Thank you.

507
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,791
-Where's Scooby?
-I hope he's okay.

508
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:05,229
-Right here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
-Hey, Scoob.

509
00:44:57,953 --> 00:45:02,788
I have a sinking feeling these dudes
aren't brainwashed cult members.

510
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:07,361
What do they want with the students?
We need to follow them.

511
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,622
-Say what?
-Defeat them and save Fred and Velma.

512
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:17,204
Sort of like my plan: Get out of here,
let the creatures eat Fred and Velma.

513
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:21,001
No way. Fred and Velma
always figured out everything.

514
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,837
Now it's our turn.

515
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:27,676
For the first time, they're
the damsels in distress, not me.

516
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:30,909
-Help?
-Timber.

517
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:44,833
-Okay, I'm calling for help.
-No. I got this. I got this.

518
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:50,400
I don't got this.

519
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:04,819
-Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon.
-Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island.

520
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,045
Our friends were...

521
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,958
...kidnapped.
We need someone here right away.

522
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,756
We do have a unit in the vicinity.
Can you meet them at the pier?

523
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:18,399
All right, they'll be right there.

524
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,433
"Our friends have been kidnapped."

525
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:59,586
-Something messed up is happening.
-Is the Coast Guard here?

526
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:03,386
What happened to the shattered windows
and busted walls?

527
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:05,460
Yo, Red. The ball.

528
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:11,029
Let's go.

529
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,648
Anyone else think this is strange?

530
00:47:30,322 --> 00:47:33,257
-Okay, we need to split up.
-Why?

531
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:36,825
-We need to find Fred and Velma.
-I'll go this way.

532
00:47:37,029 --> 00:47:39,293
And we'll go with you.

533
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:42,300
Come on, Scoob.

534
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,395
Fred?

535
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:23,268
Yo, the bitch was like, "What?"
And I was like, "Later on!"

536
00:48:25,177 --> 00:48:27,737
What up, dog? And...

537
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,473
-...dog.
-Keeping it real.

538
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:35,813
-What happened last night?
-We got beats like it was the lizz-nizz.

539
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:38,956
-You know what I'm saying, G?
-No.

540
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,086
You hear that?

541
00:48:50,669 --> 00:48:52,603
Get the dog.

542
00:48:55,707 --> 00:48:59,199
-Damsel in distress.
-Let go of me. Help!

543
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,139
Hurry, get the door!

544
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:15,087
-Why is Fred in a bad mood?
-He's not in a bad mood, Scoob...

545
00:49:15,294 --> 00:49:17,558
...he's a monster.

546
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:30,602
-Shaggy, bikes!
-I know, "yikes!"

547
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,868
No, bikes!

548
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,701
Scoob!

549
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,492
Shaggy, look out!

550
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:01,196
I just saw my friend Beth Ann.
Something's wrong with her eyes.

551
00:50:01,406 --> 00:50:03,340
Like, hop on!

552
00:50:16,188 --> 00:50:18,554
Like, what a drag!

553
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,896
Like, duck!

554
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:55,455
-Yes!
-That was great!

555
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,120
-Are you all right? You were great.
-You too.

556
00:51:02,234 --> 00:51:06,637
-Scooby, what are you doing, man?
-Mary Jane is a man in a mask.

557
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:09,830
-Mary Jane is a man in a mask?
-Scooby.

558
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,067
What are you doing, man?
Step off, Scoob.

559
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,303
Shaggy, you're whipped.

560
00:51:15,514 --> 00:51:19,314
I'm whipped? Yeah?
Why don't you say that to my face?

561
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:22,146
Okay, I will.
Your mommy eats cat poop!

562
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:25,118
No, Scooby-Doo,
your mom eats cat poop!

563
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,052
Bring it.
You want a piece of the Shagster?

564
00:51:30,262 --> 00:51:32,822
-Feel the pain, Scoob.
-Okay.

565
00:51:33,031 --> 00:51:35,090
Come on! Two shots! Two shots!

566
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,293
Me and you, me and you again.
I'll give you some right now, buddy.

567
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,774
Scoob!

568
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:48,406
I gotta save him.
You stay here, I'll be right back.

569
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:50,581
No, Shaggy.

570
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:53,407
I mean, it's too dangerous.

571
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:57,679
I've got to. He's, like, my best pal.

572
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,858
Friends don't quit.

573
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,494
Scoob?

574
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:20,241
Scooby-Doo...

575
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:23,439
...where are you?

576
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:26,145
Scoob?

577
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,919
Shaggy. Shaggy.

578
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:06,150
Shaggy!

579
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:09,817
Velma.

580
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,363
I'll save you.

581
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:24,267
Thanks, Shaggy.
Boy, am I glad to see you.

582
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:28,276
Let me go so I can return to my body.
Get out of here...

583
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,677
...before they steal
your protoplasm too.

584
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:34,918
I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy.

585
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:38,684
Jinkies!

586
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:13,650
-Hey, buddy.
-Shaggy!

587
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:20,354
Someone must have spiked my root beer
last night. Talk me down, man.

588
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:23,796
Fred, you're a frigging
protoplasmic head.

589
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:27,762
I know.

590
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:31,902
But I'm still the best-Iooking
protoplasmic head here.

591
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,075
How do you drive this?

592
00:54:36,281 --> 00:54:40,115
The Darkopalypse's upon us.
Get what you need for the ceremony.

593
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,946
On your right. Your left.

594
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,423
I'm coming, good-Iooking!

595
00:54:49,794 --> 00:54:54,060
-Thank you, you've saved me.
-Sorry, I'm looking for my friends.

596
00:54:54,265 --> 00:54:55,664
But...

597
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,938
Put me back, Shaggy.
I'll figure a way out myself.

598
00:55:04,376 --> 00:55:06,139
-Like, how?
-I don't know.

599
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,303
I'll use my tongue as an oar
and swim to the edge.

600
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,846
Sorry.

601
00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:29,865
Yo, yo, you, yo.

602
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,036
What the...?

603
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,589
You could use a little sunlight.

604
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:13,273
That's one part of the mystery solved.

605
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:17,039
The creatures need our bodies
to survive in sunlight.

606
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:19,750
Like a human suit.

607
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:23,011
SPF 1,000,000.

608
00:56:23,988 --> 00:56:27,424
But what are they doing here
in the first place?

609
00:56:29,461 --> 00:56:31,759
Daphne, you okay?

610
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:34,154
Yeah.

611
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:37,528
-But I'm not Daphne!
-Fred?

612
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:48,170
I couldn't get to my body.
I didn't know where else to go.

613
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:51,644
It's not easy to steer
when you're pure spirit.

614
00:56:55,186 --> 00:56:57,882
I can look at myself naked.

615
00:56:58,089 --> 00:56:59,420
Oh, brother.

616
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:10,466
-Get your hands off me.
-Daphne?

617
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:15,264
-He planned this somehow, didn't he?
-Hey, good-Iooking.

618
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:18,539
Fred, you egocentric...

619
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:22,144
-Please tell me you guys are you.
-Fred keeps touching me.

620
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:25,748
Makes you nostalgic
for the homicidal creatures.

621
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,680
I stole this. I hope it helps.

622
00:57:28,887 --> 00:57:31,151
The Daemon Ritus.

623
00:57:37,262 --> 00:57:40,493
-I'm me again.
-Yippee for you.

624
00:57:40,698 --> 00:57:44,225
Man, like, why am I wearing a dress?

625
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:48,371
Everyone remain calm.
Velma, what the heck's going on?

626
00:57:48,573 --> 00:57:50,438
If I am correct...

627
00:57:50,642 --> 00:57:55,204
...due to the instability of protoplasm
in the proximity of the Daemon Ritus...

628
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:59,509
...we're going to continue
randomly changing bodies until...

629
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,674
Jinkies!

630
00:58:03,154 --> 00:58:06,317
...until the protoplasm realigns
with the correct bodies.

631
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,287
I'm Fred again!

632
00:58:08,493 --> 00:58:13,021
Daph, what's wrong with you?
Don't you ever eat?

633
00:58:18,937 --> 00:58:19,926
I'm me.

634
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:22,106
-I'm back.
-Like, me too.

635
00:58:22,307 --> 00:58:24,104
Told you so.

636
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,704
-Oh, no.
-Let's go.

637
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,011
I guess that was the wrong ingredient.

638
00:58:34,652 --> 00:58:36,017
Wait.

639
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,784
I know how to handle this guy.

640
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:41,584
Hey, you! What're you doing?

641
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:44,421
Yes. That is masterful.

642
00:58:44,629 --> 00:58:48,963
I'm doing a voodoo ritual.
I need to get the right ingredients.

643
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:53,365
The only way to protect myself is
by blessing this dead Arnouki beast.

644
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:57,940
They're about to perform
their evil Darkopalypse ritual.

645
00:58:58,142 --> 00:59:00,337
-Darkopalypse ritual?
-Right.

646
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:04,208
-That's what the ancient text describes.
-Don't open that!

647
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:08,112
They use the protoplasm
in the vat as an energy source.

648
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:13,621
And the leader needs to absorb a purely
good soul to complete the ritual.

649
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,851
Legend has it,
once the ritual is performed...

650
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:20,896
...the creatures will rule on Earth
for 10,000 years.

651
00:59:21,065 --> 00:59:24,592
That's why I have this in my house.
To protect myself.

652
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,237
You have another one of those?

653
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:31,865
Those creatures are taking over
the world? That is so mean.

654
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:36,776
They can't do the ritual without a pure
human soul. Where will they get one?

655
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,111
I didn't say human.

656
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,912
Oh, boy.

657
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:02,433
Hello, puppy.

658
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:05,906
If the person behind all this
needs Scooby-Doo...

659
01:00:06,077 --> 01:00:09,171
Then that person is the one
who brought Scooby here.

660
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:18,586
Scoobert. How are you, my friend?
Sit down, please.

661
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:20,246
Okay.

662
01:00:22,427 --> 01:00:24,418
Scooby Snack?

663
01:00:24,595 --> 01:00:26,563
Maybe one.

664
01:00:30,868 --> 01:00:33,359
We'll need some more of those.

665
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:36,800
That's me!

666
01:00:36,975 --> 01:00:41,378
It certainly is.
And that's because...why?

667
01:00:41,546 --> 01:00:45,038
We love you, Scooby-Doo.

668
01:00:45,216 --> 01:00:49,277
Unlike that alleged friend
of yours, Shaggy.

669
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:55,821
He wouldn't believe you about
that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he?

670
01:00:56,461 --> 01:00:57,985
No.

671
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:01,629
But I believe you, my friend.

672
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:06,736
And that's why I've got
a very important job for you.

673
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:08,462
What's that?

674
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,439
That's a cat with a bobbing head.
Please don't touch it.

675
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:16,573
I would like you...

676
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:20,775
...to be a sacrifice.

677
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:23,352
A sacrifice?

678
01:01:27,025 --> 01:01:30,256
If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby,
why'd he invite the rest of us?

679
01:01:30,428 --> 01:01:33,659
It doesn't matter.
We gotta, like, go save Scoob.

680
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:37,562
Our area of expertise is nut jobs
in Halloween costumes.

681
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,896
We're supposed to be heroes, man.

682
01:01:41,439 --> 01:01:44,704
So I'm gonna do what I always do:

683
01:01:44,876 --> 01:01:49,609
I'm gonna eat myself a Scooby Snack,
and I'm gonna save my best pal.

684
01:01:51,783 --> 01:01:53,580
Velmster?

685
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:59,048
You think I'm gonna fall for that?
Giving me my own nickname?

686
01:01:59,624 --> 01:02:02,616
Trying to make me feel like...

687
01:02:02,794 --> 01:02:05,319
...part of the gang?

688
01:02:07,665 --> 01:02:09,633
We could make a plan.

689
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:13,931
What can I do? The only thing
I'm good for is getting caught.

690
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,573
But you never let that
stop you before.

691
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:21,701
And if that's not a true hero,
then I don't know what is.

692
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:33,716
Let's get jinkie with it.

693
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:10,191
Okay, so we use the pulleys
to tip over the vat.

694
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:14,127
Daphne will open the air vents
and release the disco skull.

695
01:03:14,298 --> 01:03:16,357
The light will refract off the skull...

696
01:03:16,534 --> 01:03:21,665
The creatures will explode, I'll find
Scoob, and we'll have saved the world.

697
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:25,337
Oh, no. The ritual's beginning.

698
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,001
Quick. Attach this to the vat.

699
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:38,982
We're here to save you.

700
01:03:39,157 --> 01:03:40,784
Shaggy, faster.

701
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:42,715
All systems go.

702
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:44,751
Wait, no!

703
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,920
Mystery Inc. rides again.

704
01:04:17,195 --> 01:04:20,187
Quick, hide the Daemon Ritus.

705
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:34,711
Would you like another Scooby Snack?

706
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,679
Okay.

707
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:38,838
Scooby-Doo!

708
01:05:55,793 --> 01:05:59,126
Yo, yo, yo. Yo, homedogs.

709
01:05:59,297 --> 01:06:01,629
You forgot the next part
of the dance...

710
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:05,030
...where we do the Electric Slide,
you know...

711
01:06:15,813 --> 01:06:18,008
Hurry up, Velma.

712
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:23,209
Welcome to my little
end-of-the-world party.

713
01:06:23,387 --> 01:06:26,686
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

714
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:31,419
Thank you for returning
the ultimate party favor:

715
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:34,393
The Daemon Ritus.

716
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,864
And now, behold the sacrifice.

717
01:06:42,273 --> 01:06:45,538
Thank you. Thank you.

718
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,235
Hello, thank you.

719
01:06:50,314 --> 01:06:52,305
Thank you. Shaggy?

720
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:58,511
Let's run for it.
We gotta get out of here.

721
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,687
-I'm a sacrifice. Hello.
-A sacrifice?

722
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:05,693
Dude, that's not a good thing, Scoob.

723
01:07:10,134 --> 01:07:11,999
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

724
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:16,936
And I'm sorry I haven't been
a very good friend since we got here.

725
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:20,236
-But you gotta trust me now.
-You don't trust me.

726
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:25,849
I do trust you.
Now, look. Who's your best buddy?

727
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:28,416
-Shaggy.
-Right.

728
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,577
And who's my best buddy?

729
01:07:31,188 --> 01:07:33,554
-Scooby-Doo?
-That's right.

730
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:38,957
You are. And we're like two trippy peas
in a far-out pod, man.

731
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:42,931
Best buddies trust each other.
Let's do what we do best.

732
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,503
Let's run out of here screaming
in fear like two lunatics, okay?

733
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:50,731
On the count of...
Let's make it five. One.

734
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,368
Two.

735
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:02,748
Hey, look at me!

736
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,759
The moment is at hand.

737
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:22,372
Through the Daemon Ritus,
I shall absorb the energy source.

738
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:35,275
And now, to complete
the transformation...

739
01:08:35,453 --> 01:08:39,446
...I shall absorb the pure one.

740
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:45,060
Ultimate power shall be mine!

741
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:47,993
Nobody absorbs my pal!

742
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:03,305
Come on!

743
01:09:05,716 --> 01:09:08,276
I'm free!

744
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:10,952
Look at me!

745
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:13,089
Get him!

746
01:09:15,626 --> 01:09:17,423
Let's get the Daemon Ritus.

747
01:09:17,595 --> 01:09:19,995
Get off my pincer!

748
01:09:28,072 --> 01:09:30,267
Cowabunga!

749
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:40,345
Look, Velms. A man in a mask.

750
01:09:45,155 --> 01:09:49,854
We love you, Scooby-Doo. We love you.

751
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:53,694
That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy.

752
01:09:53,864 --> 01:09:55,593
I shall absorb...

753
01:09:59,003 --> 01:10:03,030
Puppy power! I've outsmarted...

754
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,333
Scrappy-Doo.

755
01:10:07,511 --> 01:10:11,379
Correction.
The new, improved Scrappy.

756
01:10:11,549 --> 01:10:17,749
Because l, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo,
have absorbed enough energy...

757
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:23,451
...to rule the world
with my all-powerful army!

758
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:29,423
And I've brought you here,
puny, pathetic Mystery Inc...

759
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,559
...to witness my moment of triumph.

760
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:38,697
All I need to complete
my transformation is Scooby-Doo.

761
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:43,676
Me? Don't you mean Melvin Doo?

762
01:10:43,847 --> 01:10:45,405
Seize them!

763
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:48,484
Like, let's get out of here!

764
01:10:49,753 --> 01:10:52,244
Take that, pretty boy!

765
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:10,763
This is totally un-groovy, Scoob.

766
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:14,968
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

767
01:11:31,095 --> 01:11:35,555
Yield to my puppy power!

768
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,726
-We gotta tip over the protoplasm vat.
-How?

769
01:11:38,902 --> 01:11:41,462
The pincer. Come on.

770
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:50,670
You all need to step back,
because Fredster's got his groove on.

771
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:13,767
Got you! You look
so much bigger on TV.

772
01:12:27,985 --> 01:12:29,919
You're done!

773
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:42,856
Come back here, you lazy beatnik.

774
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,068
-Crud.
-Told you so.

775
01:12:57,981 --> 01:13:00,176
Like, wow!

776
01:13:00,551 --> 01:13:03,179
Give me the dog!

777
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:08,053
Down! Sit! Bad Scrappy!

778
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:21,770
Let's finish this puppy! Now!

779
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,531
Not again.

780
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:26,903
Captured again, señorita?

781
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:30,911
Not this time!

782
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:51,963
-Now who's the damsel in distress?
-Me?

783
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:53,902
Straight up.

784
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,371
Mystery Inc., this ain't over!

785
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,645
Not by a long shot!

786
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:41,375
I'll rock you and sock you...

787
01:14:41,552 --> 01:14:44,043
...and crush you like...

788
01:14:44,955 --> 01:14:47,287
-Like, dude?
-What?

789
01:14:47,457 --> 01:14:50,858
You're a bad puppy!

790
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:10,203
Come on, I can still take you.
Put them up, you mangy mutt.

791
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,042
Is that all you got?

792
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,169
-We did it!
-Yes, we did.

793
01:15:44,648 --> 01:15:46,843
Cut it out.

794
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:05,159
Mr. Mondevarious, is that you?

795
01:16:05,335 --> 01:16:08,429
Thank goodness!
Thank you! Thank you!

796
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,732
Velma! Thank you!

797
01:16:15,846 --> 01:16:19,179
You're fogging up my glasses.

798
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:24,684
Two years ago, that little pest...

799
01:16:24,855 --> 01:16:28,018
...turns up at a casting session
for our evil elves.

800
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:30,421
Next thing I know,
I'm stuck in a hole...

801
01:16:30,594 --> 01:16:34,587
...and he's cavorting about
in a mechanical version of me.

802
01:16:34,765 --> 01:16:38,599
But look, thank you so much.

803
01:16:40,037 --> 01:16:44,030
What a delight. Fantastic!
Fantastic!

804
01:16:54,618 --> 01:16:56,279
I love you, Shaggy.

805
01:16:56,453 --> 01:16:58,387
I love you too, Scoob.

806
01:16:58,555 --> 01:17:01,285
Now get off me, buddy.

807
01:17:05,062 --> 01:17:08,463
Thanks. You saved my life.

808
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:10,759
Like, no problem.

809
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:20,909
And thank you, Scooby-Doo.

810
01:17:21,311 --> 01:17:25,680
-My little schmookem-wookem.
-Shucks.

811
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,303
Fred, can you tell us
how you solved the case?

812
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:59,074
It all started when I was giving
a speech on my new book and...

813
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:06,480
And I think the Velmster
should take it from here.

814
01:18:08,425 --> 01:18:10,017
Go.

815
01:18:13,764 --> 01:18:18,030
Through the combined
intuitive powers of Mystery Inc...

816
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:24,504
...we've discovered the real villain
is, in fact, Scrappy Cornelius Doo...

817
01:18:24,674 --> 01:18:27,507
...who sadly was corrupted
by the power of the Daemon Ritus.

818
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:30,942
Get over it!
So I got a little cranky.

819
01:18:31,114 --> 01:18:35,483
It's no reason to freak out like a jerk
and try to kill all of humanity.

820
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:39,281
I would've gotten away with it too,
if not for you meddling sons of...

821
01:18:39,456 --> 01:18:41,890
Now that Mystery Inc.
is back together...

822
01:18:42,059 --> 01:18:45,290
...any comment on the Mud Bog Ghoul
who's been terrorizing London?

823
01:18:45,462 --> 01:18:48,192
Whatever the case,
Mystery Inc. will be there.

824
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:49,889
Solving mysteries, man.

825
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:54,432
-Righting wrongs.
-Looking for clues and kicking butt.

826
01:19:12,389 --> 01:19:14,516
How groovy is this, man?

827
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:18,889
Spooky Island finally came through
with its all-you-can-eat deal.

828
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:24,590
And there's nobody I'd rather
gorge myself with than you, Scooby-Doo.

829
01:19:24,768 --> 01:19:27,896
-My best friend.
-You're my best friend, buddy.

830
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:32,402
You're beautiful like a beautiful
piece of pizza.

831
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:41,341
Zoinks! Them peppers is, like, hot.

832
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:44,981
-Wimp.
-Wimp? You think you can handle it?

833
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:49,455
Why don't you put your mouth
where your mouth is?

834
01:19:52,896 --> 01:19:54,386
Okay.

835
01:20:03,974 --> 01:20:08,035
Scooby-Doo, you feeling okay?

836
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,718
Here you go, dude.

837
01:20:34,771 --> 01:20:37,535
-Like, how'd that taste, man?
-Delicious.

838
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:40,141
Well, let's get two more.

839
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:51,146
On the count of three.
One, two, three!

840
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:21,372
