1
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,200
My name's Huck... Huck Finn, and this
story's about me and a slave namedJim.

2
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
It's mainly the truth. Oh, sure,
there's a few stretchers here and there,

3
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,920
but I never met anybody who didn't lie
a little when the situation suited him.

4
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,880
So kick off your shoes,
if you're wearin' 'em,

5
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,480
and get ready
for a spit-lickin'good time.

6
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,880
Come on, Finn !

7
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Hit me ! Come on !

8
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
Come on, Finn !
Come on !

9
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,440
Come on, Finn!
Come on! Let's go!

10
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,920
Hit me ! Hit me ! Come on !

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,720
- Hit me! Afraid of me?
- That all you got?

12
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,000
Come on--

13
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,840
Knock him
into Tuesday, Huck !

14
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,000
- Ahhh! Ahhh!
- Oooh!

15
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,800
Ahhhhhh !

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,720
- Go for the glory, Huck !
- Yeah, go for the glory !

17
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,160
Personally I can't see no glory
in punching an ignorant lard ass.

18
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,720
But... I gots to.

19
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,240
- Pap.
- Come on! What're you doin', Huck ?

20
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,560
I whooped him !
I whooped him good !

21
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,480
- Hey, Louise ! Is Jim home ?
- Hello, Huckleberry.

22
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,360
- Hey. Thanks.
- My husband's in the cabin.

23
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,120
Ohhh! I'm startin'to lose
the vision. I'm startin'to lose--

24
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,000
It's goin' and it's goin' !

25
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Ahhh, now it's comin' back.
It's comin' back now.

26
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,280
- Aaah !
- Hey, everybody.

27
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,280
Hey, Sam. Hey, Otis.

28
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,520
Hey, Huck.

29
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,200
- Sorry for bustin' in,Jim.
- That's all right.

30
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,400
- But I need some advice on my futures.
- What kinda advice you need ?

31
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,960
Pap's back.

32
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,760
Are you sure ? 'Cause he ain't
been seen for more than a year now.

33
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,840
I saw his boot print,
the cross made with nails.

34
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
To ward off the devil.
Yeah, that's your pap, all right.

35
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,360
- I need to know what he's gonna
do and how long he's gonna stay.
- Now hold on.

36
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,040
I ain't never done this
for no white folks before.

37
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,400
I-I-I don't even know
if it's gonna work.

38
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,080
Give you some marbles.

39
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,280
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to try.

40
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,120
Thanks,Jim.

41
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,160
- What in hell's bells is that ?
- Hair ball... from a ox !

42
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,880
Puked it up just the other day.

43
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,560
- That'll tell me my future ?
- Shhh !

44
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,200
Spirit lives on the inside of it.

45
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,400
Yeah. Uh-huh.

46
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,480
Uh-huh.
Ya don't say ?

47
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,840
No ! Not to my good friend
Mr. Finn here !

48
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,360
No !

49
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
Your old Pap got two spirits
hoverin' around him.

50
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,960
A sweet one with wings
and a mean one with horns.

51
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,880
Sometime he listen to the good one,
and sometime he listen to the bad one.

52
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
The good spirit tell 'im
to leave you alone,

53
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,520
but the bad one tells him
to come and get ya !

54
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,760
Now, the hair ball
don't know...

55
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,480
which spirit gonna be
the most convincin'.

56
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,960
It says that your future...

57
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,160
is driftin' like...

58
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
the river.

59
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
When your Pap's around...

60
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,080
he always beatin' on you, ain't he ?

61
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,680
Yeah...

62
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,040
when he can catch me.

63
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Well, the hair ball thinks that maybe
you ought to skedaddle for a while.

64
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,000
At least until after
your Pap goes away again.

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,240
Come tomorrow morning, they'll be
talkin' about me in the past tense.

66
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,520
Jim was owned
by Miss Watson, and about a year ago...

67
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,760
Miss Watson and her sister,
the Widow Douglas, took me in.

68
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,200
They wanted to civilize me, which most
people thought was a right nice idea.

69
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,680
But seein'as how I'm so ignorant
and kinda low-down and ornery...

70
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,680
- Huckleberry !
- You come in here !

71
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,920
- it wasn't workin'out real well.
- You missed dinner.

72
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,440
- You'll go to bed hungry.
- So if ya starve to death by mornin'...

73
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,320
- we'll lay your carcass out
for the birds to eat.
- Oh, my land !

74
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,280
- What happened to your eye ?
- How'd ya get that shiner?

75
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,040
I saw a blind man
walkin'down the street...

76
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,560
when all of a sudden a gang
of thieves jumped out and grabbed him.

77
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,960
Well, I tried to stop 'em,
but bein'so little and all,

78
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,560
they just walloped me
in the eye and ran off.

79
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,200
That the same gang of thieves who stole
your school books last week ?

80
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,080
Yep, same gang.

81
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,240
You told us you whopped 'em so bad
they was never comin' back !

82
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,840
I-I did. But this time
they brung reinforcements.

83
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,640
Hey, where is your fancy school clothes,
Huckleberry! What are these rags ?

84
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,200
You played hooky, didn't ya ?

85
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,360
No, ma'am.
I went to school.

86
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,040
And on my way home, I ran into a poor
mother with her ten poor children.

87
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,240
Last week that poor mother
only had eight children.

88
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
- Well, now she's got two more.
- Uh-huh.

89
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,440
- Anyways, I gave 'em my fancy
clothes to help 'em stay warm.
- Hmm !

90
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
You sweet child !

91
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,600
I knew we could change him.
I just knew it.

92
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,840
- Why, he's downright chivalrous.
- Why, he's downright nauseous.

93
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,960
And for being so chivalrous, I'm going
to clean you up and dress you up...

94
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,600
and give you something to eat
before evening prayers.

95
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
Meow!

96
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Meow.

97
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,160
- Shhh !
- Come on down, Huck.

98
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,080
Aw, hell.

99
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
I should've known better.

100
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,120
I should've finished packing and
ran away right then. But no,

101
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
I had to go sneak out and play
with my friends one last time.

102
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,280
Little did I know... that
that one mistake was gonna
change my life forever.

103
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,000
- Goin' somewhere ?
- Maybe I am, and maybe I ain't.

104
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,200
Don't you give me none of your lip!

105
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,840
I don't wanna wake
anybody up just yet.

106
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,080
But you move, and
I'll wail ya good.

107
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,240
Well, looks like you put on considerable
many frills since I've been away.

108
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
I hear ya can read and write.

109
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,480
Who told you to meddle in such
highfalutin foolishness anyhow ?

110
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,080
The widow told me.

111
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,120
- I'll wail you good for meddlin'
in something like that!

112
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,200
Pretty soon you'll be taking up
religion like your ma did.

113
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,520
Would you leave Ma out of this ?
She's dead and you better--

114
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,040
Don't you sass me,
or you'll be joinin' her !

115
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,880
Well, ain't you
the sweet-scented dandy !

116
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,400
With your polished clothes
and your nice bed.

117
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,000
I never seen such a son as you!

118
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,480
Well, I'm not gonna stand for it.

119
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
Leave me alone! Let me go!
- You're comin' with me!

120
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,040
- Let me go !
- Oh !

121
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,920
No!

122
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,800
- Let me go ! Let me go !
- Pap Finn,
you devil in disguise!

123
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,320
Outta my way, you old maid ! This here
is what's mine, and I'm takin' it !

124
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,720
- Put that sweet boy down ! Ohh !
- Leave them alone ! Leave them alone !

125
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Say good-bye, boy,
'cause you ain't never gonna see...

126
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
these two old biddies again.

127
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,240
I knew I was in trouble, and
it were only gonna get worse...

128
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,640
once Pap started drinkin'.

129
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,840
I was up the river
with some acquaintances of mine,

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,640
and we were doin'some...
jobs, and I got the news.

131
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,000
So when I found out
your ma left you $600,

132
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,560
I figured I'd come and get my due.

133
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
I mean, don't I deserve it...

134
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,720
after all the trouble and expense
I went through to raise you proper ?

135
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,320
But no.

136
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,120
judge Thatcher says that money's
gotta stay in the bank 'til you
get yourself to legal age!

137
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,720
Legal age.
I can't be waitin'that long!

138
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
What'd I do with that bottle ?

139
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,400
But I'm...

140
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm your next of kin.

141
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,560
And you're my little angel.

142
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
I-I ain't no angel, Pap.
You can ask Miss Watson.

143
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Aaah !

144
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,560
Damn it!

145
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
No, Pap! No!

146
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
No ! No !

147
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,000
No, Pap !

148
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,640
- Yes !
- Pap!

149
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,480
What're you doin' with my gun ?

150
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
Uh... I thought I heard
somebody tryin' to break in,

151
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,760
- and I was waitin'for 'em, Pap!
- Well, why didn't ya rouse me ?

152
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,240
I tried, but I couldn't.

153
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Hey, what're you
doin' here anyway ?

154
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,760
You brought me here, Pap.

155
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Did I ? Why ?

156
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,520
- 'Cause you said you missed me so.
- Don't you lie to me.

157
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,640
That couldn't be the reason.

158
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,480
Oh,yeah, that money your ma left you.
DamnedJudge Thatcher!

159
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,160
Have to think of another way.
Look at this place.

160
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,240
- What'd you do to my house ?
- I didn't do anything, Pap.

161
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm goin' to town.
You clean up around here.

162
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,840
Yes, Pap.

163
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,160
Mmmm. "Yes, Pap."

164
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
Little runt.

165
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,480
I knew if I stuck around I'd be dead.

166
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,560
But dead was the only way
Pap would ever leave me alone.

167
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,200
Wild boars are mighty good eatin'.
And this one were gonna
save my life as well.

168
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,720
What the--

169
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Now that I was dead,
I could do what I wanted...

170
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,320
and go where I wanted,
and neither Pap nor Miss Watson
would ever try and follow me.

171
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,800
And right now, I figured
I'd go toJackson's Island.

172
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,360
No one lives there
nor hardly visits,

173
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,720
and the fishin's
awful good too.

174
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,680
- Aaah !
- Aaah !

175
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,080
- Huck ?
- Hell's bells,Jim !
I almost puked up my livers.

176
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,200
- I thought you was dead.
- I ain't dead.

177
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,280
But your Pap came into town
this mornin'...

178
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
screamin' about how some robbers
had cut you into a million pieces.

179
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,000
Faked it all,Jim.
I'm as alive as you.

180
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,360
- Nope. You ain't dead.
- Funny,Jim !

181
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,240
- Your Pap look like he done
seen the devil himself.
- Scared him, did I ?

182
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,520
Scared him ? You scared the
whole town. They's out huntin'
down your murderer right now.

183
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,040
- That's mighty nice of'em.
- The widow wants you
to have a proper burial,

184
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,840
so she got all the womenfolk fleecin'
the woods lookin' for your carcass.

185
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,640
- Wish 'em luck,Jim.
They ain't gonna find my remainders.
- No, they're not.

186
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,080
You know,
I kinda like bein' dead.

187
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,040
Come on !

188
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,480
Whoo !

189
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,640
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

190
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,520
Say,Jim ! Shouldn't ya be gettin'
back before Miss Watson misses ya ?

191
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,400
Well, Huck--

192
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,200
You promise not to tell on me
if I tell you somethin' ?

193
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,280
Damned if I would,Jim.

194
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,080
Honest Injun.

195
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,920
Well, I believe you,
so I'm gonna tell you.

196
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,360
This mornin' in all the confusion
caused by your murder...

197
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,840
- I ran off!
-Jim !

198
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
- You promised not to tell !
- I know I did ! I know.

199
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,000
And my word's my word,
and I'll keep my word.

200
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,120
ButJim...
you're a runaway slave !

201
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,040
I could get tarred
for not turnin' you in.

202
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,600
I could get lynched.

203
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,640
Why'd ya do it,Jim ?

204
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,240
A slave trader come by the other day
and offered Miss Watson $800 for me.

205
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,040
Her and the widow felt
so bad they pert near cried.

206
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,840
But times is tough. It was
just too much money to resist.

207
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,600
I couldn't let myself get sold
all the way down New Orleans.

208
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,920
- I'd never see my wife
and my children again !
- ButJim !

209
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Now ya ain't never
gonna get to see 'em.

210
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,400
My only chance is
to go downriver to Cairo.

211
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,040
- Go south ? A runaway slave go south ?
- I know, I know !

212
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,320
But I got me a canoe,
Huck, and this.

213
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
A map to freedom.
Now, here's me.

214
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,960
If I can get myself
all the way down here to Cairo,

215
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
where the Ohio River
comes into the Mississippi,

216
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,320
I can take it all the way
up to the free states.

217
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,800
You know how hard that'd be,Jim ?
It's a million miles to Cairo !

218
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,640
And a slave
on the river by himself?

219
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,520
- Ya won't get five miles.
- I know.

220
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,240
But if I could do it,
if I could...

221
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,480
I'd get the chance to earn
money to buy my family.

222
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,400
Ah, hell !

223
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
We'll do it together.

224
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,680
I'll help you get to Cairo.

225
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,000
Aw, shut up,Jim !

226
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,360
- Now, don't be long,
and don't forget the eggs.
- All right. All right.

227
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,280
- And the flour.
- All right.

228
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,240
And the candles,
matches, tobacco--

229
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
Hell's bells,Jim ! Whatever ain't
nailed down is what I'll get !

230
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,360
And don't let nobody
recognize you.

231
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,680
- Well, hello, ma'am.
- Hello, child. My lands!

232
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,280
- What happened to your eye ?
- A cow kicked me.

233
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,480
Gracious ! Well,
what can I do for you ?

234
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,160
Well, I was comin' from
Hookville to visit my cousin...

235
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,080
- when my horse went lame.
- Oh, dear me! Well, come in, come in.

236
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,920
My, that's a pretty bonnet !

237
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,280
- A little girl across the lane
has one just like it.
- It's a popular style.

238
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,960
Well, it looks so much cuter on you.
So, what's your name ?

239
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,520
Sarah.
Sarah Williams.

240
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,040
Well, she got
to talking about this and about that...

241
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,960
and blah-di-blah-di-blah until I wanted
to wring her scrawny little neck.

242
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,080
So I decided to take advantage
of the situation.

243
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,880
But by and by, she got to
talking about the murder.

244
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,960
That's where
my husband is right now,

245
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,640
out with some of the other men
trying to hunt up the murderer.

246
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,720
And when they find him,
they's gonna shoot him.

247
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,280
That's good ! 'Cause I heard
Huck Finn was such a sweet boy.

248
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,720
That ain't what I heard.

249
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,840
So who do they think
killed him ?

250
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,040
At first, everyone figured that
old Pap Finn done it himself.

251
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,440
- Is that so ?
- They almost lynched him, too.

252
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,880
But then he up and vanished with
some of his rapscallion friends.

253
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,360
It ain't no matter.
'Cause now everyone judges that
the man who murdered poor Huck Finn...

254
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,520
were a runaway slave named Jim.

255
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,200
Jim !

256
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
Jim ?

257
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,520
Missus, where's my jacket ?

258
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,680
- Howdy, little one.
- Hello, good sir.

259
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,840
- What're you fetchin' off for ?
- I think we found
that murderin' runaway slave.

260
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,600
- Huh !
- Now, we been lookin' everywhere,
and some old codger just now...

261
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
said that he saw smoke
out on Jackson Island.

262
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,360
Ain't nobody lives there and hardly
anyone visits, so it's gotta be him !

263
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
Hey, hey!

264
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
- Now, you watch yourself
there, little precious.
- You be careful!

265
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,360
Oh, don't worry, I will. That slave
is worth $400, dead or alive.

266
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
I best be goin' now.

267
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,600
Oh, not until
you've had some vittles.

268
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,040
- What was your name again ?
- Mary... Williams.

269
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,680
I thought you said it was Sarah.

270
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,520
Yessim, I did.
Sarah Mary Williams.

271
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,040
Somes calls me Sarah;
somes calls me Mary.

272
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,360
My goodness!

273
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,760
- You think you could
hit that rat for me ?
- Be happy to.

274
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,240
- Got 'im !
- Good arm you got there.

275
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,040
Ohhh, I keep it in shape
with lots of knittin'.

276
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,440
- You is a boy !
- Oh, how you do tease a poor girl so.

277
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,360
You may fool some, but not me!

278
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,800
If you was a girl, you'd have missed
that rat by six or seven feet.

279
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,000
Now fess up !
Who is ya ?

280
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,000
You fess up, you little thing !
You tell me, who is ya ?
You tell me, who is ya ?

281
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,160
Oh! Oh!

282
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,680
Come back here !

283
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,760
-Jim ! Jim, wake up! Wake up!
- Huh ?

284
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,040
- Oh, man !
- Look at you, Huck.
If you ain't the prettiest--

285
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,200
They's after us,Jim, and there ain't
a minute to lose. Come on !

286
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,760
- Come on.
- Hurry up !

287
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,400
- Come on, come on !
Them dogs sound hungry !
- Then get a move on.

288
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,800
Hey!

289
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
We was off,
headin'down the mighty Mississippi...

290
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
on the journey to Cairo
to setJim free.

291
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,160
'Course, first we had to stop
along the way and borrow a few things.

292
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,520
Say, Huck,
I been feelin'...

293
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,920
mighty guiltful 'bout all this
borrowin' we've been doin'.

294
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,920
- Ah, you'll get over it.
- That ain't the point.

295
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,600
That ain't who
I think it is, is it ?

296
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,960
It's you, all right,Jim.

297
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,760
" Four hundred dollar reward.

298
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
- Runaway slave."
- And what's that say ?

299
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,320
Uh... handsome
and well-mannered.

300
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,880
Oh-- Now come on, Huck,
what's it really say ?

301
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,040
Nothin'.
Just that you're wanted for murder.

302
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,840
Murder ! I--

303
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,680
Ohhh, I see.

304
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
I'm wanted for your murder.

305
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,720
Well, we best travel only at night.

306
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,280
Is that what I really look like ?

307
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,920
- 'Fraid so,Jim.
- Damn !

308
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,760
- Oh, did you see that ?
- Let's go for it !

309
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,520
- What if there's people on it ?
- No way !

310
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,480
A body'd have to be crazy
to be on that wreck !
She's bound to break up any second.

311
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,920
Oh, fine ! Then let's
just get right aboard !

312
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,200
Looks like she ain't
been here long.

313
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,040
Yeah. Might be some good loot around.
Let's split up and see what she's got.

314
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Hold on, hold on ! Dead bodies is
what she's got, so let's be careful.

315
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,280
Right !

316
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,440
- I'll go this way.
- I'll go below.

317
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,640
- Oh !
- Oh !

318
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Please don't kill me, boys.
Please don't kill me!

319
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,800
You're a lyin'thief,
joe Turner, and now you're gonna
pay for it with your life!

320
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,000
Wait, listen! You can keep my share,
I won't tell nobody!

321
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,760
It's too late for that now!

322
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,080
Ohh! Ohh!

323
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,040
This thing's sinkin'
quicker than we figured!

324
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,560
Yeah, let's get the booty
and get outta here!

325
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,680
- You can't just leave me here.
You can't leave me !
- You killed your own partner.

326
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,320
He deserved the bullet
I gave him !

327
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,440
Uhhh !

328
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,640
Aaah !

329
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,600
Damn ! One more like that
and she's had it !

330
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,040
You can't just leave me here, boys.
You can't just leave me!

331
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,560
- Ah, shut up !
- Uhh !

332
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,000
- Hey, get over here!
- Aaah !

333
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,360
- Who are you ?
- Nobody.

334
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,880
- What're you doin' here ?
- Nothin'.

335
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,400
Grab the silver!

336
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,040
Oh, my God !
We're goin' down !

337
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,440
Aaah !

338
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,520
- We best be goin',Jim !
There's pirates on board !
- I know, I know !

339
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,080
The canoe!

340
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,480
Damn !

341
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,960
- They must have a boat
on the other side ! Come on !
- Let's get it !

342
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,920
There it is !

343
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,600
Move it, move it !

344
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,280
- Come on ! Help me,Jim !
- I'm comin', I'm comin' !

345
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,320
I feel sort of bad for them
murderers dyin'like that.

346
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,320
I might end up bein'
murderer myself someday,

347
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,120
and how would I like it,
drownin'on some barge ?

348
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,480
- Huck ?
- Yeah,Jim.

349
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,360
If you was to hear that your Pap wasn't
ever gonna return to St. Petersburg,

350
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,760
like, if he up and died or some
such, would you still help me
to get to Cairo and be free ?

351
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Or would you go on back home ?

352
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,240
I'd go back, most likely,just to see
the look on people's faces.

353
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,160
We'd both go back,Jim,
bein' the right thing and all.

354
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,840
Yeah. Sure, bein'
the right thing and all.

355
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,040
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
Miss Watson takes you back.

356
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
Smell that, Huck ?
Smells like freedom.

357
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,320
If that's Cairo,
I'm a free man !

358
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,240
And when I'm free,
I'm gonna work hard...

359
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,280
and save every penny and buy
my wife and my children.

360
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,280
And if they won't sell 'em,
I'll steal 'em !

361
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,040
You wouldn't.

362
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,360
Only if they won't
sell 'em, Huck.

363
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,800
They're my wife and my children.
It ain't right that
they be bought and sold.

364
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,640
Someone gonna do it.
Ought to be me.

365
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,200
Listen to yourself.
Ya hear what you're sayin' ?

366
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,920
Sellin' people and usin' 'em
for slaves ain't right, Huck.

367
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,880
- Somehow--
- That's the way it is, and that's
the way it's always been.

368
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But it ain't right, Huck.

369
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,040
Don't ya see that to be true ?

370
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,560
Slavery ain't right.
All men should be free.

371
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,640
I've never heard
such talk in my life.

372
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,920
Right then I knew
what I was doin' was wicked.

373
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,160
And I could feel the hand of God
about to take a swing at me.

374
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,800
Then suddenly I knew what I had to do.
I had to turnJim in.

375
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,960
Say, uh...Jim ?

376
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,240
- Yeah, Huck.
- All these towns lookin'the same,

377
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,600
how're we gonna know
which one's Cairo ?

378
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,880
- We'll see the Ohio River
comin' in, won't we ?
- We might miss it.

379
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,360
I'll tell you what. Next time we
see someone I'll grab a log,

380
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,840
- paddle ashore and ask 'em.
- Don't worry, Huck. We'll see
the Ohio River comin'in.

381
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,560
But we might miss it !

382
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,720
Best make sure.

383
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,080
Yeah.

384
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,360
Sure, Huck.

385
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,840
- Find anything, boys?
-Nothin' over here!

386
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,120
I know we're close, Huck.
We're safe!

387
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,280
You really don't have to do this !

388
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
Cairo could be anywhere.

389
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,320
I'll be right back.

390
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,960
I'd come
mighty close to helpin'setJim
free and goin'to hell for it.

391
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,200
But now I was gonna
do what's right,

392
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,480
and I was startin'
to feel real good.

393
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,320
There he goes...
true blue Huck Finn.

394
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,480
The only white gentleman ever kept
his promise to old Jim.

395
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,040
Huck Finn, a man of his word.

396
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,200
A man who sticks by his friends
come hell or high water.

397
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm mighty proud to know him.

398
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,240
Ah, shut up,Jim.

399
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,680
Never forget ya, Huck.

400
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,240
Best friend I ever had.

401
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,920
I felt just sick,
but I says to myself,

402
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,160
"Self,you's got to tell on 'im.
It's the only right thing to do. "

403
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,520
- You boy !
That a raft out there yonder ?
- Yes, sir, it is.

404
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,920
- Is it yours ?
- Yes, sir.

405
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,240
Any men on it ?

406
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,240
just one, sir.

407
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,520
We're lookin'for five slaves
that ran away last night.

408
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,800
The man on the raft,
is he white or black ?

409
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,400
He's white.

410
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,480
And maybe you're one of them
abolitionist boys that likes
to help runaway slaves ?

411
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,920
- I believe we'd better
look for ourselves.
- Oh, I wish you would.

412
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,120
'Cause it's my Pap out there,
and he's awful sick. And so is
my mom, my sister, my brother--

413
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
You said there was
one man on that raft.

414
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,680
I saw your guns and just
got scared, I guess.

415
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,880
Need a tow over,
if ya don't mind.

416
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We do mind, boy.
We're in a hurry.

417
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,760
- Oh, come on, get on board.
- Thank ya.

418
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,160
People usually just run away when I tell
'em my whole family is sick as dogs.

419
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,120
- What's wrong with 'em ?
- Well...

420
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,960
my sister's pukin' everywhere,
my ma's smellin' real bad,

421
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,840
- my brother's skin's kinda
rottin' off his body.
- Oh !

422
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,920
Pa--- Oh,
it's disgusting !

423
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,800
Your whole family's got the pox, boy !
You wanna spread it around ?

424
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,760
But I've asked everybody,
and nobody'll help me.

425
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,960
Downstream about 20 miles is
another town. You go ask them !

426
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,280
- Would that be Cairo ?
- No, Cairo ain't
for another hundred miles.

427
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,560
Listen, boy!

428
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,440
Next time, don't tell people
what ya got. Just lie your
little face off. Now, get !

429
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,760
Uhhh ! I can't believe
you're not gonna help us.

430
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,840
The smell on that raft's
just killin' me.

431
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,320
You see any runaway slaves, boy,
you get some help and nab 'em.
You can make some money.

432
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,640
You bet, sir. I won't let
no runaway slaves get by me.

433
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,640
True blue Huck Finn.

434
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,200
It's always
so damn troublesome doin'right
and so damn easy doin' wrong.

435
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,520
But I decided from now on, I'm just
gonna do whatever come handiest.

436
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,480
- You mean French people
don't talk the same as us ?
- Why, no,Jim.

437
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,440
You couldn't understand
a single word they said.

438
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,600
- Oh, I suppose you could.
- You suppose right.

439
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,080
I was taught some of
their jabber out of books.

440
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,880
- Oooh, you know some
of their jabber, huh ?
- Yeah, I do.

441
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,040
What would you think if a man came up
to you and said, " Pallee-voo Franzee ?"

442
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,400
- I wouldn't think nothin'.
I'd just bust him over the head.

443
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,840
He ain't sayin' nothin' bad !
He just asked you if you talk French.

444
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,480
- Well, why didn't he just say it ?
- He did just say it.

445
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,280
No, he didn't !
He said, " Pallee-voo Francine !"

446
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,080
- Well, that's a Frenchman's way
of askin' if you talk French.
- It's a stupid way of askin' it !

447
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,760
- It ain't stupid !
- Well, it is ! It's ridiculous !

448
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,560
- It ain't ridiculous.
We just talk different.

449
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,840
- Lookit here,Jim !
Does a cat talk like we do ?
- No, a cat don't.

450
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,920
- Does a cow ?
- No, a cow don't neither.

451
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Does a cat talk like a cow
or a cow like a cat ?

452
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,680
All right, all right. No, they don't.
They talk different.

453
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,480
Right ! And French people talk
different than us ! Ya see ?

454
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,040
I rest my case!

455
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,920
All right, Mr. Finn.

456
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,040
- Is a cow a cat ?
- No.

457
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,000
- Is a cat a cow ?
- No.

458
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,200
- Is a cow a man ?
- No,Jim.

459
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,840
- Is a cat a man ?
- No.

460
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,560
- Is a Frenchman a man ?
- Yeah.

461
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,240
Then we don't he
talk like a man ?

462
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,280
Poke.

463
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,960
You see ?
I rest my case.

464
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,200
You know... you've got
a point there,Jim.

465
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,080
And the point is...

466
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,120
just because you're taught
somethin's right,

467
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,920
and everybody believes
it's right,

468
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,080
it don't make it right.

469
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,920
You get my meaning ?

470
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, I do.

471
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,400
-Jim ! Let's get !
- Huh !

472
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,200
Jump, Huck! Jump!

473
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,520
-Jump !
- Aaah !

474
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,080
-Jim! Jim!
- Jim!Jim!

475
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,640
-Jim !
-Jim !

476
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,280
Jim.

477
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,480
Make a move, and I'll
blast you in half!

478
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,560
That's far enough now.
See if there's anybody else out there.

479
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
Why, Pa !
He's no Shepherdson !

480
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,320
- Hush, Sophie.
- No, he isn't. Put those guns down!

481
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,000
There's nothin' Shepherdson
about him at all.

482
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,200
- Look at that face.
- Well, then, what is your name, son ?

483
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,760
I-I-It's
GeorgeJackson, sir.

484
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,440
- You see !
- Put your hand down.
- Hey, what's goin' on ?

485
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,240
- Here, let me dry you off.
- Ain't there no Shepherdsons around ?

486
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,040
You know, we might've been shot,
you bein' so slow in comin', Billy.

487
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,080
Where did you come from, George ?

488
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,560
I fell off a steamboat, sir.

489
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,880
- Whoa, fell off a steamboat !
- Oh,you poor boy!
Falls off a steamboat,

490
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,760
and then you go and
scare him to death !

491
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,160
They was real nice
once they decided not to kill me.

492
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,240
They told me they was the Grangerfords,
and asked me a million questions.

493
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,440
I decided it'd be best to leave out
the truth, so I slung 'em a story.

494
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,560
And after my pa got killed
in that stampede,

495
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,000
my ma ran off
with a circus clown.

496
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,240
Never saw her again.

497
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,720
- Well, you can stay here with us.
- As long as you like.

498
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,160
Thanks.

499
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,200
You see what I'm talkin' about?

500
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,280
Hey, George! Here's
a present for bein'my new friend.

501
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,640
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever given me.

502
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,240
- Thanks, Billy.
- Billy!

503
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,760
Everything's been real quiet between
the Shepherdsons and us lately,

504
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
so don't you go
stirring things up.

505
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,480
Oh, Sophie, leave me alone.
Come on, George.

506
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,880
Say, Billy, let's
slide on down to the river.

507
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,240
I wanna see if any of my...
belongings washed up on shore.

508
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,600
Well, first we gotta
take care of something.

509
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,160
Seems a lot of things have been
washing up lately.

510
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,400
A steamer hit his raft last night
and killed his master.

511
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,840
So he's ours.
We had to chain him.

512
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,560
Hey ! Get up !
Come on, get up !

513
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,520
Looks a little rough. Me and you
gotta break him in a little bit.

514
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,480
- Huck ! So good to see you.
- Huck ? Who you callin' Huck ?

515
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,640
Why, my name's--
Bet ya can't spell my name ?

516
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,800
I'll bet ya that dare.
It's G-O-R-G J-X-O-N.

517
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,280
You done it, all right.
I'm GeorgeJackson.

518
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,040
Pleased to meet ya, sir.

519
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,680
Say, Billy...

520
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,920
why is everybody carryin' all them guns
and lookin' so itchy to use 'em ?

521
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,400
Well, we got us
a feud goin' on.

522
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,800
Feud !
What's a feud ?

523
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,120
You don't know
what a feud is ?

524
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,560
It's like this. A man has a fight
with another man and kills him.

525
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,000
Then his brother kills him. Goes
on and on with everybody's brother...

526
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,240
tryin'to kill everybody else's brother,
until everybody's killed off.

527
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,640
Our feud's been goin' on
for 30 years.

528
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,440
30 years !
Well, how'd it start ?

529
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,240
- I don't know.
- You mean, you don't know
why y'all killin' each other ?

530
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Yes, sir ! Yes, sir !

531
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,560
Hey, Boggs ! You know Pa don't want
you doin' that any more.

532
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,360
- Get to work now. Come on !
- Yes, master.

533
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,320
Your child got three days work
before he can move on.

534
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,040
- Hello, boys.
- Hey, Pop.

535
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,880
Huck !

536
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,280
On that river, I had
a taste of freedom.

537
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,120
And now bein' a slave again--
Well, it feels so...

538
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,840
so very bad.

539
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,600
Let's get on to Cairo,
Huck. Please.

540
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,120
- Let's get on outta here.
- All you think about is yourself,Jim.

541
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,800
Well, what about me ?
Don't I deserve somethin' ?

542
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,840
I ain't had it so good
in all my life.

543
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,600
Come on, George,
we're goin' fishin' !

544
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,960
And I ain't
in no hurry to leave.

545
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,120
Hey, Boggs,
this one's all yours.

546
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,600
All right, come on,
get down outta there.

547
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,640
Come on, over here.

548
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,320
Now, my daddy was fishin'
on that other bank, not payin'
any attention to all the rain.

549
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,000
And all of a sudden the bank gave way,
and into the river he went.

550
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,840
Yeah, that's my boy.

551
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,960
All you think about is
yourself,Jim. Well, what about me?

552
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,880
Come on, George,
it's supper time !

553
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,880
I'll be right there.

554
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,280
Jim !

555
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,840
Jim.

556
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,400
It weren't my fault.

557
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,640
If you think I feel bad,

558
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,360
well, you're wrong !

559
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,760
If you think I'm gonna
apologize to a slave,

560
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,120
a runaway slave at that,
well, hah.

561
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,160
I didn't mean for this
to happen,Jim.

562
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,080
It were the worst thing
I ever done in my life.

563
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,960
I'm real sorry,Jim.

564
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,200
Honest, I am.

565
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,160
You're still my best
and only friend.

566
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,760
Huck Finn.

567
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,160
Okay, all right.
Enough of this slop.

568
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,760
-Jim ?
- Hmm ?

569
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,480
'Bout time for us
to be leavin'.

570
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,160
- Huck ?
- Shut up,Jim.

571
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,320
Sorry I'm late.

572
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,360
Cyrus !
What's goin' on ?

573
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,200
Miss Sophie went off
to marry a Shepherdson.

574
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,560
- Well, where'd everybody go ?
- The women went to raise the relations.

575
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,000
Billy and the menfolk, they gonna
try and kill that Shepherdson boy...

576
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,840
before he crosses the river
with Miss Sophie.

577
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,000
Thanks.

578
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,840
Lots of people
gonna die today.

579
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,240
They're right
up ahead, boy !

580
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Oh, let's go !

581
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,320
- Hey, Billy!
- Hey, Billy.

582
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,320
I-It's me, it's me ! Huck--
I mean, George ! What's goin' on ?

583
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,160
George, they ambushed us ! They killed
my pa and all my brothers !

584
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,360
Hell, they pert near killed us all!

585
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,320
Come on, come on !

586
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,480
We should've waited
for the relations.

587
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,240
Them Shepherdsons
knew we were comin' !

588
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,120
- What happened to Miss Sophie ?
- Her and that Shepherdson
made it across the river.

589
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,000
Them dirty scoundrels.
George, I'm gonna kill 'em.

590
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,200
Billy !

591
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,480
Shoot 'im, boys!

592
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,720
Don't let 'im get away!

593
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,400
- See anything?
- No.

594
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,880
Let's try this way!

595
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,520
Huck! Huckleberry!

596
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,040
You were mighty good
to me, Billy.

597
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,400
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you my real name.

598
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,520
It's Huck.

599
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,480
Huckleberry Finn.

600
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,520
I'm sorry, Billy.

601
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,240
Come on, Huck.
Gotta bring him home.

602
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,680
Jim and me found the
raft and fixed it up as best we could.

603
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,000
It felt good gettin'back
on the river. Other places
feel so cramped and smothered.

604
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,800
But the river don't. You always feel
warm and safe and free on the river.

605
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,080
That wasn't my fault.

606
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,320
You are the sorriest
thing I've ever seen.

607
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,680
That Russian fell in the river,
that's what happened.

608
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,400
Hello there!
We're lookin'for Cairo!

609
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,840
Can you tell us
how close we are ?

610
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,760
Chuckleheads, you already passed it !
It's about 40 miles back !

611
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,720
Talk about lost!

612
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,560
Must've missed it
that night in the fog,Jim.

613
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,160
I'll be caught
and sold for sure.

614
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,760
How're we gonna
get back to Cairo,Jim?

615
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,920
Sure can't take this raft
back up the river.

616
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,400
And no how can we fight this current.

617
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,680
- No, but we could take
a steamboat upriver !
- Yeah !

618
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,000
We'll find one that's goin' north,
and then you can buy us passage.

619
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,880
Yeah, we'll keep headin' south
'til we find us a steamboat.

620
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,840
- Take it all the way back up to Cairo.
- Right up the Ohio.

621
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,040
All the way up
to the free states.

622
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,720
Good thinkin', Huck.

623
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,600
Why, thank you,Jim.

624
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,240
- Here's some more wood,Jim.
- Right there.

625
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,800
Tryin' to get this fire goin'.

626
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,800
Come on, Duke! Over here!

627
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,640
Why are you always
stealin' chickens ?

628
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,040
I love chickens.
They're succulent.

629
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,280
- We're chicken thieves !
That's as low as it gets.
- Shut up and keep runnin' !

630
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,000
It seems to me,Jim, whenever
anybody's after anybody,

631
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,000
it's usually me
they's after.

632
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,160
Hello there,
we's in need of assist !

633
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,080
- Let's get !
- You bet !

634
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,000
Grab the oars !

635
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,000
- Hold up !
I'm right behind you, Duke !
- Come on, push off!

636
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,320
Huh?

637
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,640
What the--

638
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,040
Hey !
Get your own raft !

639
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,600
- Thank you, lads. We'd be obliged.
- Thanks, nothin' !

640
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,000
- You was gonna hightail out
and just leave us, wasn't ya ?
- No, I weren't. Honest.

641
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,920
- Please, sir.
- If ya don't let the boy go,
how's he gonna save our hides ?

642
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,560
Sorry, boy.

643
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,600
People tryin' to kill me and...
dogs tryin' to rip my face off,

644
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,760
and it ain't even breakfast yet.

645
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,400
They call me the King, the King
of Bilgewater, and this here's the Duke.

646
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,880
Pleased to meet ya.

647
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,960
The King and
the Duke seemed like nice enough fellas,

648
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,560
but something about 'em
made me feel mighty uneasy.

649
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,920
They asked us
a considerable many questions.

650
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,400
- Yeow !
- Bull's-eye.
- And once again...

651
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,000
I decided it would be best
to leave out the truth.

652
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,640
So... my ma grabbed onto
the trapeze and swung one way.

653
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,840
My pa came a-swingin' on the other.
My ma let go, did a double flip...

654
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,520
and missed my pa
by a good six feet.

655
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,760
She made quite a mess
when she hit them bleachers.

656
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,640
I think this boy's gonna fit right in.

657
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,000
Thank you,Jim. So what is it
you two fellas do, exactly ?

658
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,480
We do a fair bit
of doctorin'.

659
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,040
Yeah. We can cure cancer,
paralysis, baldness.

660
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,880
This time we're sellin' a thing
that takes tartar off of teeth.

661
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,800
- And it does take it off too.
- But unfortunately the...

662
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,000
- enamel goes right along with it.
- Yeah, well !

663
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,200
We also do some theatre.
Tragedy, you know.

664
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,400
Yeah, we got enough... Shakespearean
costumes here for the lot of us.

665
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,760
But what we do best
are the three Es.

666
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,680
Robbery, forgery...

667
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,760
and burglary.

668
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,680
Hell's bells !
I wish I knew a good trade.

669
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,640
Well, maybe we'll teach you one, huh?

670
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeow ! Go--
You skinny little rat bag !

671
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,080
I'm gonna wring
your skinny little neck !

672
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,800
Hey, watch it !
Stop peckin' at me !

673
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,720
- Oh, good morning, boys.
- Good morning.

674
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,680
Aw, hello, Duke.

675
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,680
- We gotta run, now, huh ?
- Naw, naw, naw, naw.

676
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,320
- I just been borrowin' a few things.
- Ah, yeah.

677
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,240
Nobody saw me.

678
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,000
But lookee what I found.

679
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,680
- You were headin' for your
Uncle Billy's plantation, huh ?
- Now, wait a minute.

680
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,320
You're a runaway murderin'slave's
what you are.

681
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,960
I think maybe I'll just
collect that reward.

682
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,680
- He only murdered me.
- Now, look, we ain't
exactly the type...

683
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,600
to turn others
into the law.

684
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,800
We stay as far away from the law
as is humanly possible.

685
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,680
So if you two just, uh--

686
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,960
Listen up and shut up
and do as you're told...

687
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,600
-and wait on us hand and foot...
- and be real nice to us,

688
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,760
we won't say a word.

689
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,960
You step out of line,
try and run and--

690
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,880
Oh, ho ho!

691
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,800
Easy prey.

692
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,120
- I'm all right!
- Ya think?
- I do.

693
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,520
- Shall we ?
- Let's.

694
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,880
Hello, there!
Happy morn to ya!

695
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,040
And a good mornin'
to you all too !

696
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,960
Say, you wouldn't
happen to be...

697
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,880
the Wilks brothers,
now, would ya?

698
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,800
- Yes.
- No !

699
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,000
- No.
- My name is Blodgett,
Dr. Alexander Blodgett.

700
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,920
This here is Franciscus, uh,

701
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,160
Adolphus and Jim.

702
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,720
- Oh, shoot.
- Adolphus ?

703
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:52,360
- I reckon it don't matter.
They already missed it anyways.
- Missed ? What ?

704
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,520
Was an, um,

705
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,440
economic opportunity
they missed, huh ?

706
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,800
Oh, ho ho !
No, no, no.

707
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,840
They'll get the money
and the property all right, but...

708
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,800
they missed the death
of their brother Peter Wilks...

709
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,240
down at Phelps Landing.

710
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,160
He died.

711
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,040
Last night.

712
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,760
- Too bad.
- So sad.

713
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,080
Yup. He said he ain't
seen his two brothers...

714
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,000
in more than 20 years.

715
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,920
Yeah ? So, uh,

716
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,840
why did you think
we was them ?

717
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,360
Well, one of the brothers,
the preacher ?

718
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,800
He's a lot older.
And the one that's deaf and dumb...

719
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,320
he's a lot younger, see.

720
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,600
So when I saw you two,
I just reckoned maybe--

721
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,840
- Are you leaving the area for a while ?
- I'm goin' to New Orleans.

722
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,760
Well, methinks this calls
for a small libation!

723
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,920
- Ha ha ha ha !
- I'll drink to that !

724
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,120
Right this way,
my gold-toothed friend !

725
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,840
We in trouble, Huck.

726
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,440
The King
and the Duke found out...

727
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,360
that the dead guy's brothers
lived over in England.

728
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,280
They hadn't had much time
to get the letter...

729
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,200
and might not have
gotten it at all.

730
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,520
So those two rat bags
grilled that flathead...

731
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,000
about everything and
everybody in his village,

732
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,080
right down to the damn
dog next door.

733
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,000
- Woof!
- Mighty smart of ya !

734
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,920
Mighty smart of ya.

735
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,920
Was Peter Wilks well off?

736
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,840
Oh, he was, uh,

737
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,160
he was as rich
as King Soromon himself.

738
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,080
I tell you,Jim,

739
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,760
the hand of providence is bound
to take a swing at them two.

740
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,160
And knowin' them,
they'll duck.

741
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,800
How are you at
playing a preacher ?

742
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,440
- How are you at playin' deaf and dumb ?
- Pardon ?

743
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,320
- Heh heh heh heh heh !
- Ha ha ha ha !

744
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

745
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

746
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,920
Attention, passengers!

747
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,520
jubilee leaving for Phelps Landing
in 1 5 minutes!

748
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,560
Do I have to wear this?

749
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,920
Wanted to learn
a trade, didn't ya ?

750
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,720
- Why can't we just wait here ?
- Because I don't trust ya.

751
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,640
You'd hightail it for sure,

752
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,520
and we need to leave this raft
here for our getaway.

753
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,440
Besides, we'll be
more convincing...

754
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,840
after we arrive with an innocent
young boy as our valet.

755
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,920
Who you callin' innocent ?

756
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,200
Look, you wouldn't want us
to accidentally turn in...

757
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,840
your runaway slave friend,
now, would ya ?

758
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,200
Come on. Play along with us
for a couple of days.

759
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,480
We'll give ya 1 0 percent.

760
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,640
20.

761
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,800
- 1 5.
- Deal.

762
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,320
- You never looked better!
- I have too looked better!

763
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,240
- You're beautiful !
- I feel ridiculous!

764
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,200
- Hey, King !
- Yeah ?

765
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,080
- Let's go buy those tickets.
- All right.

766
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,520
- Be right back.
- Shoo! Shoo, fly!

767
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,880
Shoo !

768
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,280
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha !

769
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,040
Funny, Huck. Very funny.

770
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,880
What in hell's bells
are you supposed to be ?

771
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,400
The King said I was
a Swahili warrior.

772
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,360
Even taught me some Swahili,
or what he said was Swahili.

773
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,760
- Sounded like a pig in heat to me.
- Hee hee.

774
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,080
I'd poked around a little...

775
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,600
and found out that
a steamboat was leavin'...

776
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,560
from Phelps Landing
the day after tomorrow...

777
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,480
and headin'all the way
up to Cairo.

778
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,520
So all we had to do was put up with
them rat bags for two more days,

779
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,440
then it was
off to freedom.

780
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,800
Uh, begging your pardon
on this,

781
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,120
can any of you
good people tell me...

782
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,480
where Mr. Peter Wilks
lives ?

783
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,400
I'm looking for
Mr. Peter Wilks.

784
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,240
Get out of the way,
for heaven's sake.

785
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,040
Peter's brothers,
right ?

786
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Uh, heh-heh-heh.

787
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,320
- I can tell by your fancy accent.
- But we're sorry to say...

788
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,200
we can only tell you
where Peter did live...

789
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,600
up until yesterday.

790
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,800
Oh. What you're
tellin'me, I think,

791
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,360
is that my dear,
sweet brother Peter...

792
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,400
has gone to the Lord.

793
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,440
He held on for you as long as he could,
but yesterday he passed.

794
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,640
And we came all the way from England.

795
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,240
Alas. Alas.

796
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,120
And we never got to see him.

797
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,040
Excuse me.

798
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,000
I must communicate
with me deaf brother.

799
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,720
- I told you before, she's my woman!
- No, she's not!

800
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,240
Hey, don't I know you two ?

801
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,880
Yeah, I do !
You're that--

802
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,040
Stand aside !

803
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,040
Welcome to America !

804
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,120
My dear, sweet MaryJane.

805
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,320
- Uncle Harvey.
- Ho-ho-ho!

806
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,840
Mmm, mmm--

807
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,560
Enough. Heh-heh.

808
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,120
Ah,you're as bloomin'beautiful
as Peter said you was.

809
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,440
- You sure are.
- Ha ha ha!

810
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,320
This is my,
uh, valet, Adolphus.

811
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,240
My English valet,
right ?

812
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,400
Right, right. Heh.

813
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,840
- Isn't he the sweetest looking boy ?
- Why, thank you, missus !

814
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,520
Heh-heh.
Oh, and this is my Swahili warrior...

815
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,600
I picked up in Africa
on a safari with the Duke of York.

816
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,840
He makes a great slave.

817
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,920
Yeah. Yes, of course.

818
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,600
Er, might we, uh,

819
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,280
pay our respects
to our brother's remainders ?

820
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,520
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Rather, William.

821
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,160
Uh, my brother says...

822
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,480
he'd like to invite friends
of the family for supper,

823
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,560
people mentioned by our dear Peter
so often in his letters.

824
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,080
- No, I won't forget--
- You know, we might just prosper...

825
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,880
hanging around with them two.

826
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,200
More than likely,
we'll get our necks stretched.

827
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,120
Well, that old King
juiced it plenty,

828
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,840
spittin'out word-for-word everything
that young flathead told him.

829
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,640
And how's that
damn dog next door ?

830
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,920
Smelly as the dickens.

831
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,400
Oh, thank ya ever so.

832
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,360
So I says to the pope,

833
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,080
" Pope, I'd like to
stay and help ya,

834
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,080
but I've got a
blinkin'job to do...

835
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,160
down in the bloomin' Indian Ocean
savin' the blinkin' pirates."

836
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,480
Watch yourself, Huck.

837
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,480
She's just a girl,Jim.

838
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,480
Adolphus, have you
ever seen the king ?

839
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,480
- Him ? Oh, yeah. William III.
- George IV.

840
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,120
Oh, the King of England !

841
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,720
Oh, why didn't you bloody say so ?
Course I have.

842
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,240
He goes to our church, regular.

843
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,760
But I thought he lived in London.

844
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,400
- Well, he does.
- But you live in Sheffield.

845
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,760
That is to say...

846
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,320
he goes to our church
when he's in Sheffield.

847
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,680
Do you go to church ?

848
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,680
Of course I do.
We got our own pew right up front.

849
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,960
- Whose pew ?
- Why, ours. Your
Uncle Harvey's, of course.

850
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,560
What would he need a pew for ?
Isn't he preaching up in the pulpit ?

851
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,880
My thoughts exactly.
Now, do you suppose...

852
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,320
there ain't but one bloody, blinkin'
preacher to a bloomin' church ?

853
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,240
- What would they want more for ?
- Style.

854
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,160
If it's a priest before a king,

855
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,160
you got to have
lots of style goin' on.

856
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,120
In our church,

857
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,960
we've got 1 7 bloody, blinkin',
bloomin'preachers.

858
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,160
- Where's Buckingham Palace?
- In Buckingham.

859
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,920
- Who's the King married to ?
- His wife.
- What's her name ?

860
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,800
- Uh, the queen.
- Queen what ?
- Queen of England.

861
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,120
Ha ! You don't know anything, do ya ?
Well, I think...

862
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,040
-you're the biggest fibber--
-Susan!

863
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,800
How dare you
speak to him so,

864
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,160
him being a stranger
in a strange land,

865
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,200
so far from his own people.

866
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,200
He was telling a few stretchers,
and I wasn't swallowing them.

867
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,760
You apologize to him
this instant.

868
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,800
I apologize, Adolphus.
You're a dear, sweet boy.

869
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,520
I'm ashamed
I called you a fibber.

870
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,160
- Women.
- Here, now, have some pie and milk,

871
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:16,320
- because you are so sweet.
- Why, thank you ever so.

872
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,760
And these are the girls
we're lettin' those reptiles...

873
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,680
rob of their money.

874
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,200
- A right good day, MaryJane !
- Good day to you, Adolphus.

875
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,120
Ah, we've just been...

876
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,160
for a marvellous walk in the woods.

877
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,520
What a lovely country !
Ha-ha-ha !

878
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,480
A right good day, sirs !

879
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,400
Would you happen to know where the--

880
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,440
the great Swahili
warrior's sleepin' ?

881
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,760
We decided the Swahili bit was pushing
it and asked him to wait at the raft.

882
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,800
Well, what about--

883
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,760
- A good lad !
- Here it is, Uncle.

884
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,800
Father said only you
should open it.

885
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,480
Oh. Bless him.

886
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:02,000
" Last Will and Testament
of PeterJ. Wilks.

887
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,880
I, PeterJ. Wilks,
being of sound mind..."

888
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,480
Well, the dead
geezer gave the girls his houses,

889
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,480
the slaves, and thousands
of dollars in gold.

890
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,400
Then he gave more gold...

891
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:17,000
"to my dear, beloved brothers
Harvey and William."

892
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,680
Praise be to the Lord.

893
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,320
Er, "The gold is hidden in the barn
behind the vineyards."

894
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,080
Well, William, I guess we better
go and get it.

895
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,120
- Well ?
- Well ?

896
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,520
There, behind the grindstone.

897
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,200
Aah ! Allow me.

898
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,560
Wow !

899
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,080
Begging your pardon !
Hmph !

900
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,640
If this ain't bully, nothing is.

901
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,600
Like I told you this morning,

902
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,840
we're goin' all the way
with this one.

903
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,640
All for us and none for them.
Let's count it.

904
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,400
I don't think it's right, us stealin
from them nice girls.

905
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,880
You're in it now,
you little stinkweed.

906
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,320
- Right up to your
sneaky little eyeballs.
-And if it goes wrong--

907
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,600
You'll take your punishment
right along with us.

908
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,360
Ya know what they'll
do if they catch us ?

909
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,440
Ya know what happens to ya
when they tar and feather ya ?

910
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,920
- Do ya ?
- No, sirs !

911
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,280
No, I-- I don't know !

912
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,840
The tar oozes into your pores.

913
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,680
Clogs 'em up real tight.

914
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,360
- Suffocates your skin.
- Ya get all green and sick.

915
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,600
Then ya choke and ya cough.

916
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,120
Until ya tear your own flesh
so's ya can breathe.

917
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,400
But ya can't breathe !

918
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,400
And half the time,
ya die from it.

919
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,400
And those
that don't die...

920
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,320
feel so bad,
they wish that they had.

921
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,760
And that's just what'll happen to you
if ya open your mouth.

922
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,200
Hey.

923
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,800
Maybe young Adolphus here
has the right idea.

924
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,800
We should give the money
back to the girls.

925
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,320
That's a dazzling idea, King.

926
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,320
- That'll knock over their suspicions.
- Shut 'em up for good.

927
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,000
- Until we steal it all back.
- Yeah, we give them the money...

928
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,840
and that gives us the time
to steal everything else.

929
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,480
Genius.

930
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,720
We're gonna be set for life !

931
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,560
I'd had enough,
and steamboat or no steamboat,

932
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,800
I figured it were time
to grabJim...

933
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,320
and hightail it to Cairo.

934
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,480
Heh-heh. Friends,
our dear departed...

935
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,600
has done generous
to his little lambs,

936
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,800
and as their uncles,

937
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,520
I think we'd
like to enhance...

938
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,640
the generous spirit
of the day.

939
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,600
You see, I knew he'd
feel the same as me.

940
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,600
MaryJane,Julia, Susan,

941
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,520
take the money.

942
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,440
Take it all.
A gift from your uncles.

943
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,240
- Wonderful !
- Dear souls, how could you ?

944
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,240
Englishman, my butt !

945
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,200
You're a couple of frauds.

946
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,720
I beg your pardon.
And who might you be ?

947
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,960
Dr. Robinson, ain't you heard?
They're Peter's brothers.

948
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,480
Doctor--
Dr. Robinson ! Oh !

949
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,800
My brother's, oh, good friend
and physician.

950
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,520
Take your hand away from me,
you impostor !

951
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,920
They proved it 40 ways
that they're the brothers.

952
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,240
- They even knew everything
about the village!
- And everybody's name !

953
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,200
- They even know about
the damn dog next door.
- Enough !

954
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,280
They came here
with lots of names and facts...

955
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,120
they must've picked up
somewhere, that's all.

956
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,560
Yup,
it was time to leave, all right.

957
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,720
I could smell the winds a-changin',
and they stunk.

958
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,680
Turn these rascals out,
I beg you.

959
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,240
They're liars.

960
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,240
Based on what evidence?

961
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,480
Here's my answer, doctor.

962
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,120
Uncle Harvey, Uncle William,

963
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,960
take the gold back...

964
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,720
and invest it for me
and my sisters any way you want.

965
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,720
That's my answer, doctor.

966
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,880
Whooo!

967
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,000
Marvellous.

968
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,680
I hated to run out
on them sweet girls,

969
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,640
but I figured
if I stuck around,

970
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,320
that dead geezer 'n'me
would be sharin'lodgin's.

971
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,000
Hey, you seen a big slave around,
maybe hangin' on my raft ?

972
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,240
You bet I was. Two men catched him,
and now he's in jail.

973
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,560
- What ?
- They had a handbill...

974
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,960
that said he was a murderer
and a runaway...

975
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,240
- and worth $400.
- So where is he now ?

976
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,680
Took him down
to the jail in Phelps Landing.

977
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,560
- Phelps Landing.
- Yeah, we're gonna keep him there...

978
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,960
until we can take him up north
for the hangin'.

979
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,600
I'm gonna fix their wagons
but good.

980
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,640
I'd come all the way
down the Mississippi...

981
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,560
and hadn't gotten anywhere,

982
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,120
and I realized right then that ya
can't run away from your problems,

983
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,200
ya gotta make a stand
and face 'em.

984
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,040
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.
I didn't want to get you in any trouble.

985
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,040
Good,
because my butt's hangin' way out,

986
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,480
and I'd rather
not get it shot off.

987
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,400
I got to tell 'em
you're not a murderer.

988
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,320
That don't matter.

989
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,200
Me bein' a runaway's even worse
than me bein' a murderer.

990
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,720
The steamboat leaves the wharf
at 1 0:00 tomorrow tonight.

991
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,920
Don't you worry,Jim.
We'll both be on it.

992
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,600
There's something I got to tell ya
before you risking yourself for me.

993
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,600
You know that night on the steamboat
with all them murderers ?

994
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,600
Yeah.

995
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,280
Your Pap was one of'em.

996
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,560
I saw him, and he was dead.

997
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,600
Dead ?

998
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,640
Pap's dead ?

999
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,720
- You saw him and you didn't tell me ?
- I'm sorry.

1000
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,760
I'm dreadful sorry.
I was so selfish.

1001
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,680
That was a lie,Jim.

1002
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,240
That was a lie !

1003
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,080
And I thought we were friends.

1004
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,120
I did wrong.
Ain't no gettin' around it.

1005
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,960
Now I'm gonna get
what I deserve.

1006
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,880
- Hey, boy!
- Take care of yourself, Mr. Finn.

1007
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,480
Now, where have you been,
you little turd pie ?

1008
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,200
just playin' with
the damn dog next door.

1009
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,840
Just playing with the little doggies ?
I oughta--

1010
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,320
Just stay right here today !
Understand ? Hmm ?

1011
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,240
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

1012
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,720
What's that
old fool up to now?

1013
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,160
Me dear brother and I have a little
announcement we'd like to make.

1014
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,800
It don't seem right...

1015
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:56,360
for William and I to leave
these little lambs...

1016
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,080
without any kinfolk around.

1017
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,600
So we have decided,

1018
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,680
er, MaryJane,
Julia, Susan--

1019
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,080
We have decided...

1020
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,720
to take you back
with us to England !

1021
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,320
We'll be havin' an auction
tomorrow mornin'...

1022
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,320
after the funeral,

1023
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:23,840
- so tell one and all !
- We will be selling everything !

1024
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,800
We're going to England !

1025
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,880
I figured that
before I took off,

1026
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,720
I'd grab that gold
away from them two frauds.

1027
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,840
Then when I was long gone,

1028
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,480
I'd write MaryJane
and tell her where I hid it.

1029
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,800
Well, what is it ?
Make it quick.

1030
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,240
I gotta tell ya, King,
I'm just not comfortable.

1031
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,000
That doctor's been layin'
on my mind all day.

1032
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,680
We should just glide out
of here tonight with what we got.

1033
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,600
And not sell the rest
of the property?

1034
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,120
I reckon these sacks of gold
are plenty for me.

1035
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,560
I figure we should just
knock off and light out.

1036
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,560
We can't leave thousands of
dollars worth of property lying around.

1037
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,200
What about
the damn doctor?

1038
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,360
Forget about the doctor !
He's the only one that's suspicious.

1039
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,240
Everyone else
is on our side!

1040
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,360
Now, look, Duke, old friend.

1041
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,760
My brains and your bullocks,

1042
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,800
we ain't never
gonna get caught.

1043
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,720
Yeah, all right.

1044
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,600
Well,just let me
take another peek at that gold...

1045
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,800
before we head back down.

1046
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:58,160
Slice of heaven, King.
Feels like a slice of heaven.

1047
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,480
Come on !

1048
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,360
My Pap were a bad one,

1049
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,240
but he were my Pap.

1050
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,680
If you see him,

1051
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,440
tell him Huck says hello.

1052
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
Good night!

1053
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,600
Where's the stiff?

1054
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,560
- What ? Who ?
- The coffin ! Where's the coffin ?

1055
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,480
We buried him this morning.

1056
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,880
And ever since, Uncle Harvey's
been having the auction.

1057
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,040
First thing he sold
were the slaves.

1058
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,320
He separated the families.

1059
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,640
- Come on !
- Where are we going?

1060
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,240
- Got any friends out in the country ?
- Yes, the Lothrups. Why ?

1061
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,520
If I tell you somethin', promise not to
come back here until 1 0:00 tonight.

1062
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,480
- Now, why would I do that ?
-Just promise me, MaryJane !

1063
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,680
All right, I--
I promise. Say...

1064
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,000
what happened
to your accent ?

1065
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,200
Those uncles of yours
ain't no uncles at all.

1066
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,640
They ain't even English.

1067
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:31,120
Dr. Robinson was right.
Them two are liars and frauds.

1068
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,320
- What ?
- Don't you worry ! I got the gold.

1069
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,640
When this all blows over, I'll write
and tell ya where it's buried.

1070
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,840
Oh, no. I'm gonna get those two
right now and get 'em tarred--

1071
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,000
No, you're not, MaryJane.
You promised me.

1072
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,920
Why until 1 0:00 ?

1073
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,360
'Cause there's a good-hearted fellow
I gotta save,

1074
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,200
and at 1 0:00, we'll be gone.
Come on.

1075
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,200
Well, why do I have
to leave town ?

1076
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,720
Why can't I just pretend
I don't know ?

1077
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,560
Because there ain't an easier book
to read than your face.

1078
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,800
You'd give it away
for sure.

1079
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,840
Even $225... $225...

1080
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,000
$225... $2 40... $27 5...

1081
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,520
$300... now higher...

1082
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,560
- $350.
- $37 5... $37 5...

1083
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,520
- Yeah.
- $37 5 and a $400.

1084
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,320
Even $400. Sold, $400 !
Let's sell the next lot.

1085
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,280
MaryJane
was safe, the gold was safe,

1086
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,080
them reptiles
would soon be in jail,

1087
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,440
and at 1 0.00 tonight,Jim and me
would be on a steamboat...

1088
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,480
headin'for Cairo.

1089
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,400
All I had to do
was find that deputy,

1090
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,320
steal his keys,
and break Jim oouut!

1091
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,240
- Oh, I told you...
- Let me go !

1092
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,200
- not to disappear ! Didn't I ?
- Let me go !

1093
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,880
Oh, now,
don't kill him...just yet.

1094
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,120
Answer up, and quick.

1095
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,720
- Were you in our room last night ?
- No, your maj-- Unh !

1096
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,640
Where is our money ?

1097
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,640
I ain't seen it since
MaryJane gave it to ya.

1098
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,720
Honest, your majesties !
If I stole it, would I still be here ?

1099
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,080
No, I guess not,
unless you're a complete numskull.

1100
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,480
Uh-oh.

1101
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,880
Here's another
set of Wilks brothers !

1102
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,080
Just got here on
the Mississippi Queen!

1103
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,160
Ya pays your money
and ya takes your pick !

1104
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,320
Now is the hour of
your demise, you impostors !

1105
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,800
What's this all about,
my good sir ?

1106
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,320
- Please let the man through!
- That's right!

1107
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,840
I'm with you, Harvey.

1108
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,280
I am Harvey Wilks,
and this is my brother William.

1109
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,760
And you two gentlemen
are quite a surprise to us.

1110
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,680
And you to us, sir.

1111
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,600
But I must say,

1112
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,440
you should have worked on your
English accent a wee bit more !

1113
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,840
For this town
has few fools,

1114
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,840
and only a fool would be
fooled by that foolish accent.

1115
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,280
That's the worst
English accent I ever heard.

1116
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,760
- Ain't nothin' like yours, Harve.
- I'm not very well fixed...

1117
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,680
to show proof of
these frauds at the moment,

1118
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,280
for last night,
all our bags were put off by mistake.

1119
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,480
- Convenient mistake, huh ?
- Yeah, convenient.

1120
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,920
What are you doing ?
What's he doing ?

1121
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,920
Making deaf and dumb signs,
that's what he's doing.

1122
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,960
- Don't your brother know how ?
- Those are just nonsense !

1123
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,160
And of course William
can do real ones,

1124
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,760
only he broke
his arm in a fall.

1125
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,800
Ah-ha-ha !
Broke his arm, very likely,

1126
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,320
for a man who's got to make
deaf signs to prove himself.

1127
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,560
Oh, wait,
wait, wait!

1128
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,360
Now, I'm not sure these two
are the real Wilks brothers,

1129
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,560
but by God, I know
them two sure ain't.

1130
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,680
By the way, Adolphus,

1131
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:10,440
- are you from England ?
- Why, yes, I am.

1132
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,360
Speak the truth now,

1133
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,400
or by God, there's gonna be
one less idiot around here.

1134
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,960
That is to say, sir,

1135
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,880
I'm originally from Missouri,

1136
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,280
but several years ago,
I was sent to England...

1137
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,400
to live with
my great-grandfather,

1138
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,720
- the Duke of Bilgewater.
- Bilgewater ?

1139
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,000
But he died last year,

1140
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,480
and his good friend,

1141
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,560
Mr. Harvey Wilks here,
took me in.

1142
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,560
Personally, I think
you're just a damn good liar.

1143
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,720
Why, thank you for
the compliment, sir.

1144
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,400
All right, enough.

1145
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,320
We're gonna figure out
who's who right here and now,

1146
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,640
and nobody's goin' nowhere
until we do.

1147
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,680
Well, they sailed
into the investigation,

1148
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,600
hour in and hour out,

1149
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,760
the King tellin'
one story and Harvey Wilks another.

1150
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,360
But no one knew nothin'
about England,

1151
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,800
so they couldn't
figure out who was lyin'.

1152
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,000
Although most people were comin'
to believe they both was.

1153
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,000
I got it ! I got it !

1154
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,840
I can prove I'm Harvey Wilks
and these men frauds !

1155
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,520
Why didn't I think
of it sooner?

1156
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,000
Now, who here
helped lay out my brother--

1157
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:26,600
- the late Peter Wilks--
in his coffin ? Hmm ?
- They did!

1158
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,880
Me and Abe here dressed him up
and layed him out ourselves.

1159
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,800
All right, then.

1160
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,000
Perhaps you can tell me what was
tattooed on Peter's breast.

1161
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,600
Come on!

1162
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,160
Come on, out with it!

1163
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,240
We want to hear it!

1164
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,440
- Out with it !
- Yeah !

1165
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,360
All right, all right.

1166
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,560
I can tell you what was tattooed
on his breast, all right.

1167
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,600
You'd have to look
real close to notice it.

1168
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,160
Just tell us
what the tattoo is about !

1169
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,400
Come on, out with it!
Tell him !

1170
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,120
- Come on !
- Get to it !

1171
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,360
It was a small...

1172
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,240
thin...

1173
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,160
blue...

1174
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,640
- arrow!
- Arrow?

1175
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:21,000
- Yes ! There !
You all heard what he said ?
- Yeah!

1176
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,360
Did you see any such mark ?

1177
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,480
- Nope.
- Nope.

1178
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,520
You fraud !

1179
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,600
That's right, because
there isn't any blue arrow.

1180
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,560
Peter had his initials
tattooed on his breast,

1181
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,520
the letters " P" and "W".

1182
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,760
Well, come on, then!

1183
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,680
Isn't that what you saw ?

1184
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,600
I didn't see
any tattoo, did you ?

1185
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,760
I never noticed
no tattoo at all !

1186
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,040
They're all frauds !

1187
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,160
- I say we tar 'em !
- Yeah !

1188
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,600
- I say we shoot 'em !
- Yeah!

1189
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,120
- I say we hang 'em !
- Yeah !

1190
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,120
Hang 'em !
Hang all of'em !

1191
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,680
Gentlemen ! Gentlemen !

1192
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,080
There is one way to see which pair
is the real Wilks brothers,

1193
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,160
or if neither of them is !

1194
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,360
Let's dig up the corpse !

1195
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,640
Yeah !

1196
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,080
To the cemetery !

1197
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,280
We've got the tar !

1198
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,200
Well ?

1199
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,080
Dig it up !

1200
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,440
- Hey, we found it, doc !
- They hit it !

1201
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,720
All right, heave!

1202
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,000
Won't be long now,
Deputy Hines!

1203
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:27,360
- Push it! Push it!
- Got it ?

1204
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,560
- Almost got it!
Push!

1205
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,360
- Eeewwhh !
- Oh !

1206
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,880
My good God !
There's gold in there !

1207
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,840
Aah !

1208
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,560
It's the Wilks' gold !

1209
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,880
We'd best be goin', Jim !

1210
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,480
Huck ? I thought you'd have
your neck stretched by now !

1211
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,160
I'm a little quicker
than that.

1212
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,840
- Why, Huck ?
- Why, what ?

1213
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,680
Why'd ya come and get me ?

1214
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,160
'Cause you're my friend,Jim.

1215
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,840
Oh, come on.

1216
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,600
Now, let's get
to that steamboat!

1217
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:53,880
- Come on !
- It's the boy with that runaway slave !

1218
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,000
- Hit the trail!
- Get 'em !

1219
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,840
Fire !

1220
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,400
Aah! Unh!

1221
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,280
You all right, Huck ?

1222
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,560
I just tripped. I'm all right.
Keep goin' !

1223
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,720
Unh ! Unh !

1224
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,680
Last call for Cairo
and all points north!

1225
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,680
All aboard!

1226
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,600
Almost there, Huck !

1227
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:41,200
We made it, Huck !
Huck ?

1228
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:44,800
Oh! Oh, my little friend!

1229
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,880
Oh. Oh.

1230
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,920
- Go on,Jim. Go on.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.

1231
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,440
- What are ya doin',Jim?
They'll catch ya.

1232
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,400
They won't find ya
in the dark.

1233
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,320
I got to get ya to a doctor.

1234
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,600
I'll be okay.
Ya--

1235
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:03,480
Ya can't take me,Jim.
They'll catch ya.

1236
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,400
They'll lynch ya.

1237
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:09,440
- Don't go,Jim.
- Last call for Cairo!
Last call for Cairo!

1238
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:13,080
- All aboard!
- I don't care what happens to me, Huck.

1239
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,480
I just want
to get you well.

1240
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,160
Jim...Jim...

1241
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,040
We had us
a great adventure, didn't we,Jim ?

1242
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,920
- We sure did, Huck.
- And I'd do it all over again.

1243
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,840
Yeah.

1244
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,960
Get 'em !

1245
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,960
Oh !

1246
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:37,080
You can't--
You can't kill him.

1247
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,840
Don't you cry for me,
Mr. Finn.

1248
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,760
You're the best friend
I ever had,Jim.

1249
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,760
You're the only friend
I ever had.

1250
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,280
Ya can't.

1251
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,880
Aah ! No !

1252
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,320
Jim !

1253
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,960
No, ya can't take him.

1254
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,960
He's all I got.

1255
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,120
Ready ?

1256
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,160
- Tighten it up.
- Aah ! Aah !

1257
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,080
Leave the boy alone! He's innocent!

1258
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,040
- Now, MaryJane !
- And if he was trying
to help that slave,

1259
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,000
he had a good reason for it.

1260
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,680
Now you let them both go!

1261
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,320
Now !

1262
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,920
Aw, let him go.

1263
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,520
Lucky day, boy!

1264
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,840
You're awake.

1265
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,560
He's awake.
He's awake !

1266
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,640
Sweetie, we were so worried about you
but you're going to be all right now.

1267
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,200
My little Huckleberry !

1268
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,960
Widow Douglas.
Why, how'd you get here ?

1269
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:39,520
Lands, child.
You've been out cold for a week.

1270
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,920
When I heard what happened,
I took the first steamer down.

1271
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:47,240
Well, I'm sure ya think
I'm low-down and miserable...

1272
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,880
for tryin'
to setJim free,

1273
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,760
- but do ya hate me ?
- Not at all, child.

1274
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,840
I'm right proud of you. Just because
an idea is popular, like slavery,

1275
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,240
don't make it right.

1276
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,320
That's whatJim told me.

1277
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,920
Your little heart
guided you quite well.

1278
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,440
Hey,Jim !

1279
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:17,120
You lie still,
and I'll bring you some soup.

1280
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,000
Well, look at you.

1281
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,680
What is it,Jim ?

1282
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,680
Did somebody
do something to you ?

1283
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,640
- 'Cause if they did, why--
- Miss Watson died.

1284
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,360
A few weeks ago.

1285
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:50,040
And, well, she was so ashamed...

1286
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,760
that she was going to sell me away
from my wife and my children, that...

1287
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,080
she set me free
in her will, Huck.

1288
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,480
I'm a free man, Huck.

1289
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:10,880
I'm a free man.

1290
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,800
Children, come here, please.

1291
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,640
- Mr. Jenkins!
- Good-bye, Adolphus Huckleberry.

1292
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,440
Well, I healed upjust fine.

1293
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,680
MaryJane and her sisters,
along with the Wilks brothers,

1294
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,960
gave me $500 for my troubles
and my chivalrousness.

1295
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:41,440
But since I got no real use
for money, I gave it all toJim...

1296
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,320
for his family.

1297
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,200
The Widow Douglas
said she'd adopt me...

1298
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,440
and take me home
and try and civilize me...

1299
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:00,520
but I don't know
if I could stand it...

1300
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,640
'cause I've been there before.

1301
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,800
Now, where did
Huckleberry go to ?
