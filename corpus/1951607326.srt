1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,560
My pops used to always say,
''Dreaming is the luxury of children ''...

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,360
...and that I should enjoy it.

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
He was right.

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,000
Here it is, the last year of high school
for me and my friends...

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
...and this is all I can
ever really see myself doing.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,040
When you got responsibilities,
you ain't got time to dream.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,960
I guess it's the difference between
being a boy and a man.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
And down South...

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,000
...you grow up quick.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,880
Especially in the A TL.

11
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,160
This here is my 'hood.

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
Mechanicsville.

13
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
752 Mandeville Lane.

14
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,080
Middle of the city, center of our universe.

15
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Wake up, A TL, it's 6:23.
It's your boy, Frank Ski in the morning.

16
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
And we've got another scorcher planned
for you here in the Dirty South.

17
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm talking Dirty South hot
A TL weather today.

18
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,760
I tell you what, another heat index,
another record-breaking day.

19
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
''What is your ethnic background?''

20
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
I am a brother.

21
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,040
Uncle George,
my mama's brother.

22
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,080
He supposed to be raising us...

23
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,920
...but responsibility was not really
his strong point.

24
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
''Bisex-- HeterosexuaI.''

25
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
Don't get it twisted, baby.

26
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,960
Hey, Ant. You want a ride, homeboy,
you better act Iike it.

27
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,120
-That's my little brother, Ant.
-AII right.

28
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
I call him ''Jellybean. ''

29
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Hardheaded on the outside,
soft on the inside.

30
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
And that's me, Rashad.

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,480
Heir to the family business,
Swann Cleaning Service...

32
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,120
...and man of the house.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
''How wouId you describe your physique?

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Trim, muscuIar, pIeasantIy pIump.''

35
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,840
-What?
-Hey, Iet us get a box of cereaI, man.

36
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,760
We ran out.

37
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,440
Man, they aIways eating.

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,200
MuscuIar.

39
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,480
I know how much is in there too.

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
One bowI each.

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,120
Yeah.

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
My boy, Esquire.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,040
He's basically my best friend.
He got accepted to an Ivy League school.

44
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
There goes four.

45
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,160
Check out this brother, just grinning,
jogging through campus with a white girI.

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,720
ProbabIy running from that crowd of
white boys on the opposite page.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,560
Either way you Iook at it, man, you Iucky.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,280
Yeah, man. It ain't paid for yet.

49
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm gonna need grants, Ioans,
a job and a dream to pay this tuition off.

50
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
''Ex-bIackIy.''

51
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,840
We had to drive across town
because E went to Mount Paran.

52
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,720
My boy book smart...

53
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
...maybe even borderline brilliant
to these kids...

54
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
...but he's just plain old Esquire to us.

55
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,800
Why you aIways be driving in our car?

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
-Get out the car.
-Look, boy.

57
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,360
With your stupid IittIe outfit, man.

58
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,960
Rashad, I'm gonna hurt him.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,080
Man, get out of here.

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,040
-Peace.
-You mean ''War,'' brother.

61
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
War!

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,560
-How you doing, Mr. Sapp?
-Hey, Ben.

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,880
-Have a seat.
-Right.

64
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,080
I got the information you wanted
regarding the FaIcon Society.

65
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,120
Let's have a Iook.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,400
GPA is over 4.0.

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Test scores are high.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,760
Essay's strong.

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
AII you need is a good Ietter
of recommendation.

70
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
You're in great shape.

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
I was wondering if
you couId write that for me.

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm fIattered, Ben, I am,
but I'm not reaIIy the right person.

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,160
I'm sure your parents know a judge,
a businessman?

74
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I don't think my parents
know anybody Iike that, sir.

75
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
Sometimes it's not what you know...

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,560
...but who you know.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,600
Our school was a little different.

78
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,840
See, we in the Trey, Mechanicsville High.

79
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,120
Alma mater to some of
the greatest players in the city.

80
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,080
That's my boy Teddy right there.

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,040
He A TL for real.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,600
Never been outside of 285.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey, what you doing here, man?
You must have Iost your job.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Had to get my breakfast on.
Brother gotta eat.

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
Get it how you Iive, pimp.

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
-Brooklyn, from New y ork.
-No means no, man.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,480
And reminds us of it every chance he get.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,320
-Shining, ain't you?
-Can't you teII, man?

89
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,640
Guess you gonna fake it
tiII you make it, huh?

90
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,720
Man, these gonna be getting me the girIs.

91
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,080
-Not without no game, it ain't.
-What up, Tondie?

92
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
-Can we taIk right quick?
-Just did, bye.

93
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,760
Working aIready.

94
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,120
Seniors, it's almost graduation.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,680
If you haven't done it yet,
get your cap and gowns ordered.

96
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,600
We were five weeks from graduation.
I had all my credits.

97
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,920
And all I had to do was cruise for
the next month and I'd be straight.

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,560
Please give them
a Tiger round of applause.

99
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
And one more thing.

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,400
We have a lot of sports
going on this week.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,120
And we want to thank the people...

102
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,880
-...who were involved this weekend.
-Everybody in a seat.

103
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,080
Year's aImost over. Thank you, Jesus.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,040
Y'aII sIackers better figure out
what to do for the summer.

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,360
My little brother wasn't exactly
a troublemaker.

106
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,040
-That ain't right.
-But he ran his mouth too much.

107
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
-Why ain't it?
-And he was definitely hardheaded.

108
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,720
I know what I'II be doing this summer.

109
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
I'm gonna be getting paid.

110
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
Ms. Jackson...

111
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,160
...can you pIease cut on the a.c.?

112
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Man, it feeI Iike a sIave ship in here.

113
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,160
Air conditioning is for honors cIasses.

114
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,880
Kids who wanna make something
out of themseIves.

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,160
Was you in honors cIasses?

116
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
Because you ain't got no a.c. either.

117
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
See what I'm saying?

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
He stayed in trouble.

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,520
But I couldn't wait on him
to get out of detention.

120
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,160
We had to scoop Teddy.

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
How your sister doing, man?

122
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,120
I been caIIing her,
and she ain't been caIIing me back.

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,640
She trying to pIay me?
She seeing somebody eIse?

124
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,000
Come on, man, keep it reaI with me.

125
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
What's happening, Teddy?

126
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
-What up, man? You pIaying?
-I got next.

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,040
Party on the Ieft, man.
You know how it is.

128
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,200
Now open wide, wide, wide.

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,080
Bite down on that. CooI, cooI.

130
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,920
Hey, man. Ready?

131
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,120
Oh, heII, yeah. I'm gone.

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,080
Hey, man, peace.

133
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,200
After we pick up Teddy, we shoot on
over to the Shady Grove Country Club.

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
That's where Esquire works.

135
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
We expected him to be late...

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,040
...because he was always out there on
the golf course, hustling the rich kids.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,160
Yes, yes, and yes.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh, my God, I Iove poetry.

139
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,480
I write in my diary every day.

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,240
Oh, reaIIy?
Let me kick something for you.

141
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,080
She sits there
Pain filling the back of her eyes

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
Forcing them to leak

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
So aII I need to do is
I need to get your digits.

144
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Your daddy ain't around, is he?

145
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,600
Even though her tolerance
Has reached its peak

146
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,320
Now, Iook here, when you caII me,
don't even trip, okay?

147
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,480
If a Iady answer the phone,
that's my mama.

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,400
She staying with me
because she going through some things.

149
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,240
She's so soft

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,040
She could have been
The spokesperson for cotton

151
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,160
You know, that's just IittIe things
that I Iike do to...

152
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
...because I Iike to throw stuff in the air.

153
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
These guys don't know anything
about poetry.

154
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,160
They're not reaIIy cuItured.

155
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,880
-Hey, what's up, Esquire, man?
-Man....

156
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,480
-Hey, man.
-WiII you aII come on? Excuse me.

157
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,640
-Can't you see I'm over here--
-You reciting poetry and shit.

158
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
-Come on, man.
-Damn.

159
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,880
-Can we go pIease? PIease?
-Hey, man, scoot over, man. PIease?

160
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,440
You skinny enough. Scoot over, man!

161
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,680
You aIways sit in the front.
Sit in the back.

162
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,160
What the heII wrong with you,
Tiger Hood?

163
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,440
BIack NickIaus?

164
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,720
I think I miss home or whatever,
but, yo, it's so country out here, man.

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,840
It's Iike the fIies--
Why are there so many fIies out here?

166
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
-Man, I know you not gonna get into this.
-For reaI.

167
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,280
Okay, so why is there a rat on
every corner in New York City?

168
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,400
Why, after every sentence,
you caII me ''shorty''?

169
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,320
''Yo, shorty, shorty.'' I'm taIIer than you.

170
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,800
Let me ask you this, then.

171
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,960
In New York City, why y'aII say,
''Yo, son,'' after every sentence?

172
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,080
-I'm not your kid. I'm not your chiId.
-Right.

173
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,560
Why I gotta be your son?

174
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,200
-Money?
-B?

175
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,920
I caII you ''sun'' because you shine Iike one.

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,840
-You feeI me?
-Yeah, that was reaI sentimentaI, thanks.

177
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,280
-Oh, heII, yeah.
-Thank you.

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,080
-Y'aII need anything eIse?
-No, we aII right.

180
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,000
-ActuaIIy, Iet me get some iced tea?
-Sweet or unsweet?

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,600
-Sweet.
-She choosing, huh, BrookIyn?

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Shut up.

183
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,000
BrookIyn! Oh, good Lord!

184
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,320
That ass fatter than
a swamp possum with the mumps.

185
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
-Okay, you got a point.
-See what I'm saying?

186
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
That's country.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,960
Y'aII get y'aII cap and gowns yet?

188
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,800
-Oh, yeah, I got mine.
-I know you do.

189
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,200
Yo, you sure you graduating, Teddy?

190
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,440
Like, come on, for reaI, B,
just give it up. Like, come on, Teddy.

191
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,520
That ain't funny, man. I'm trying.

192
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,360
-Wait a minute.
-I'm trying.

193
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Ain't you about
in the 1 4th grade now, dog?

194
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,880
Yeah, I'm in the same cIass
with your mama.

195
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,680
By the way, I ain't seen her IateIy.

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,160
You gotta teII her to come in and
check in with Daddy at the house.

197
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,240
I need my money on time.

198
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,200
Hey, don't make jokes about me, okay?
I'm sensitive.

199
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Y'aII know where that girI New New
go to schooI at?

200
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,440
Seem Iike she onIy be around
when we be kicking it.

201
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,320
-She ghetto, man.
-Yeah, boy, just how I Iike them.

202
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
You better Iean back, shorty.

203
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
You know she Rashad's girI.

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,800
-Rashad.
-Now, how you figure that?

205
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
-Come on, man.
-Come on, man.

206
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
Shut up, you know you Iike her too.

207
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,880
I don't even be taIking to that girI.

208
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
So why you just wave at her?

209
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,560
Shut up, man.

210
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
He put you out there, homeboy.

211
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,720
We were all at the same place
in our lives...

212
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,920
...trying to figure out what's next.

213
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,160
The one thing I did know:
These were my friends.

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
I could trust them.

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,040
And Sunday night, we got loose.

216
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
-That's right.
-Let's go and do the damn thing, man.

217
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,600
-Let's do it.
-Big oId head.

218
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
Let's go.

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Sunday night at Cascade.

220
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,680
Fine Georgia peaches and wet paint.

221
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,160
It was a beautiful place to be.

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm gonna knock him out next time.

223
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,160
We'd been coming to Cascade
since we were kids.

224
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
What's up, man?

225
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,120
I had my first fistfight here,
and my first kiss.

226
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
We knew everybody...

227
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,760
...from the security guards
to the hottest shorties.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,760
Rashad. Rashad!

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,920
-I know you heard me.
-Don't he know chocoIate meIt in the heat?

230
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,680
-I'm gIad somebody recognize.
-Don't try to get no feeI, neither.

231
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,600
GirI, I got grandkids oIder than you.

232
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,640
Cascade's is a rite of passage
to every kid in the A...

233
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,280
...but for us, it was something more.

234
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,840
AII right, everybody,
Iet's get it on the fIoor.

235
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,960
Y'aII Iooking a IittIe rusty tonight.
Y'aII better be practicing out there.

236
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,640
There's something wrong
with these wheeIs.

237
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,280
Ain't nothing wrong with these wheeIs.
You can't skate.

238
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,160
Inside here,
it's like all our problems don't exist.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,760
It's the only place where
we all felt like we could be free.

240
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,960
Man, it's crazy out here tonight.

241
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, yeah, y'aII, here we go again.
Cascade's on a Sunday night.

242
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,600
If you can't skate,
get your ass off the fIoor.

243
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,080
If you got skiIIs,
then, shorty, you got to prove it.

244
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,400
School sucks, rent past due,
your girl left you.

245
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,280
On Sunday night,
don't none of that matter.

246
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,360
y ou could be
whoever you wanted to be here.

247
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,800
Can't take bIack foIks nowhere.

248
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,400
Man, get off the fIoor.
Get off the fIoor.

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,880
HandIe that, Mr. Referee.

250
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,960
HeIIo? HeIIo?

251
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,360
-Who was that?
-I don't know. They keep hanging up.

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,160
Star-69 them.

253
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,960
Excuse me, I am not a ho.

254
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,720
There's all kinds of characters here.

255
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,880
y ou got the Cool Cats and they crew.

256
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,520
y ou got the Fly Girls.

257
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
And the D-boys is in here too.

258
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,520
Somebody always dying from their clique.

259
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,160
But nobody matters like the skate crew.

260
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,360
And we were the Ones.

261
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,440
This year, we was taking Skate Wars.

262
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,120
Let's go, man.

263
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,520
Even when the rink was crunk
on Sunday night...

264
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,040
...sometimes I felt like
I was out there all by myself.

265
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,000
Floating above it all.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,200
No lies, no pain...

267
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,240
...and no worries about
what tomorrow might bring.

268
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,560
Shantay, hurry up,
we got dance rehearsaI.

269
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Guess you don't know nobody
no more, huh?

270
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Man.

271
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,080
No, I guess not.

272
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,080
I'm saying, Rashad,
you know I didn't mean what I said.

273
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,120
Man, whatever. That don't even matter.

274
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
Look, my mama not home.

275
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,040
You wanna give me a ride?

276
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,840
Man, your mama ain't never home.

277
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,560
Take care, though.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
I ain't have time to mess with Tonya.

279
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,360
If we was gonna win the war,
we was gonna need practice.

280
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,600
Some of us more than others.

281
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,440
-We have identified the weakest Iink.
-Shut up, boy.

282
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,920
You aIways taIking.
Rashad, get your brother.

283
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,280
-He might be right this time.
-Yeah, for reaI.

284
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,640
Two, three, four. Oh, goddamn.

285
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,640
Hey, girI, hey!

286
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,440
I wonder what her career path is.

287
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,400
Excuse me, gorgeous.
Can I get at you for a second?

288
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,880
I got that. Fine ass.

289
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,160
-So where you going?
-Boy, you know you need to quit.

290
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,200
You see I'm getting hot.
I'm sweating and aII that.

291
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,280
I can't take him no more, son.

292
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
-That's it. That's it.
-And here he go.

293
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,920
-What happened, man?
-I'm done.

294
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,040
-I'm done.
-Again?

295
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,000
-Wanna try that one more time?
-I got this. I'm good.

296
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,040
Yo, BrookIyn, you're fired, man.
Quit Ioitering here.

297
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,960
Keep it moving, son. Keep it moving.

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,640
AII right.
I don't know if you that good, but....

299
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,760
Leave your uniform before
I take it out of your check.

300
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,240
-HoId up, man.
-Get the heII out of here, you idiot.

301
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,960
-''Keep moving, son''?
-I cannot run my pizza pIace without you?

302
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,520
Man, be that way, then.
That's why you need a timing beIt, bitch.

303
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Shut up! Grow some hair on your chest!

304
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,800
You see what I mean?

305
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,680
-Watch out, man.
-See what I'm saying?

306
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,760
I can run my pizza pIace without you!

307
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Man, pizza was invented in BrookIyn!

308
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
And my hat too.

309
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,240
-You gonna break your Ieg.
-Pizza was made in BrookIyn.

310
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,200
You better cooI it, man.
CooI out, man.

311
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,400
-You done Iost weight, man. HeII, yeah.
-You idiot.

312
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,080
I need a vacation.

313
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey, quit spIashing!

314
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,680
-SIow down!
-You gonna hurt yourseIf.

315
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's another A TL scorcher.
I heard it's gonna be hot today.

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,680
They told me the kids
are heading out to Lake Lanier.

317
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,160
If you're not so lucky
to head out to the lake...

318
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,600
...a pool is the place to be.

319
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,560
Head down to your neighborhood pool...

320
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
...because it is the coolest place
you want to be today.

321
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,680
See, that's why I Iove coming out here.
Look at this here.

322
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Yo, Esquire, man, you are ashy.

323
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,600
For reaI. It's Iike somebody
threw baby powder at your knees.

324
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,880
You ashy too, man. What you saying?

325
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,800
I don't know what type of Iotion
you gonna use for that arm.

326
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,760
You gonna need some baby oiI,
some WD-40 or something.

327
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,800
Some car engine oiI
might work for you.

328
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,560
-Trying to taIk about somebody.
-Man, hide your waIIets.

329
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,320
Here come Ghetto Ghetto
and her two twins.

330
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,120
What y'aII doing?

331
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
-What it Iook Iike?

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,400
What, whoa, wait a minute.

387
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,200
Considering the fact that both of y'aII broke,
those better be knockoffs.

388
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,280
If I hear y'aII been up to no good at that

389
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,120

Bragging rights for the year.

418
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,320
Why you don't cut across the middIe

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,360
-Don't say nothing unnecessary.
-AII right.

431
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,160

Anyway, Iike I said, I went downstairs,

So I'm Iike, ''Did she take my house keys?''

440
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,000
She must have went

441
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,120
Oh, sh--

Somebody caII the ambuIance.

00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,280
...stumble at the most.

449
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,080
But you don't fall.

450
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,960
This is humiIiating.

451
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,640
Shorties ain't checking

452
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,200

-Did you say John Garnett?
-Yeah.

457
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,840
-The John Garnett?

458
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,400

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,760
Let me show you, man. Look at this.

00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,160
WeII, since you took over United Express...

470
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,080
...the company has six consecutive quarters
in the bIack.

471
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,640

472
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,280

But where the food at?
Because I'm hungry.

485
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320

486
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,040

-A Iot of roaches.

487
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,440
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing. I'm good.

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,080
So how do I skate?

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,400
...or skates or something.

666
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,560
Don't be wasting that on me.

667
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,800
I guess just because your head big,
that don't make you smart.

668
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,000
Hey, I beIieve in you, even when you

669
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,920
-What's the deaI?
-What's up, man?

670
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,640
-Man, I hear you hoIding now.
-Man, who toId you that?

671
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,040
Why you tripping?

00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,680
Yeah, but you been out of schooI

673
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,520
Man, I had mono.

674
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,920
-No.
-AII right, that's what's up.

675
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,040
Narc.

676
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,520
Hey, Ben.

677
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,360
Oh, hey, Mr. Garnett.

678
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,840
Nice to see you again.

679
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,080
My buddies and I, we Iost our fourth.
Afraid of a IittIe weather.

680
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,800
You pIay?

681
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,360
That's my partner.

682
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,400
Oh, damn.

683
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah!

684
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,960
So your famiIy's from the city, Ben?

685
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,000
You're not
a MechanicsviIIe hood product.

686
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,520
No, not me, sir.
You wouIdn't catch me in a pIace Iike that.

687
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,800
That shot on 1 7 was about 200 yards.

688
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,400
HeII of a game, man.
We whipped their asses.

689
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,520
Yes, we did.

690
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,720
Oh, man.

691
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,520
Oh, no, no, sir.

692
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,600
-It was my pIeasure.
-Oh, no, don't be siIIy. You earned it.

693
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,160
And if there's anything I can ever
do for you, you Iet me know.

694
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,480
WeII, actuaIIy, there is something
you couId heIp me out with.

695
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,000
TaIk to me.

696
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I couId use a Ietter of recommendation.

697
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,240
And she had the nerve to step to me.

698
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,720
-She know she Iucky too.
-Forget her.

699
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,880
The question is, what happened
when Rashad gave you a ride, nasty?

700
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,040
-''I'II take her.''
-Nothing happened.

701
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,800
-You Iying.
-It's aII in your griII.

702
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,440
That's him right there. Come on.

703
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,680
Men, grab your Iadies.
Ladies, grab your weaves.

704
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,000
It's about to be on.
Y'aII got three minutes tiII coupIes' skate...

705
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,040
...and four weeks tiII Skate Wars.

706
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,120
But untiI then, hoId this.

707
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,760

...and, man, the ugIy herbaI.

710
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,640
-I gotta smoke something.
-Hey.

711
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,200
Man, I don't understand
a word that you been saying.

712
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,760
What you want, man?

713
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,080
WeII, weII, weII.
So we meet again.

714
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,160
What's up, gorgeous?

715
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,000
You teII me.
You're the one that's shining.

716
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,560
Oh, you know, that's how we do.
But you Iook mighty fine yourseIf.

717
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,760
Oh, thank you.

718
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,080
So do you wanna hook up or what?

This thing's off the chain, tonight, man.

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,040

725
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,000

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,680

00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,120

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,040
He never sits in the front.
Now he wanna sit in the front.

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,160
-Sit your ass over.
-Shut up.

00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,760
-Ain't you gonna wait on Ant?
-He say he got a ride.

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,080
That tickIes.

738
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,400
That's my beIIy button, baby.

739
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,840
Yeah, yeah. I know.

740
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,720
Good, baby.

741
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,120
You're getting cIoser.

742
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,040
-That's strong, baby.
-What's up? What's up?

743
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,000
-Was it a good idea to keep my money?
-No, no!

744
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,120
Shut up. Come on. Get up.

745
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,080
Come on. Come on.

746
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,920
Boy,
don't you know I graduated with a 3.68?

747
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,160
Lord, I'm parched.
Let me get my drink.

748
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,520
This supposed to be my famiIy,
my bIood cousin.

749
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,160
-Give me the money. Give me the money.
-AII right.

750
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,000
-It was onIy 1 00 doIIars.
-That's it?

751
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,720
Shut up.

752
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,600
Shut up.

753
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,520
You better not teII my mama.

754
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,000
Come on, baby.

755
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:04,455
That empty space right there on the bar,
that's for this year's trophy.

756
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,737
Don't even worry about that.

757
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:08,692
A IittIe confident, aren't we?

758
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:11,630
For good reason. You Iike the poIe?

759
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,802
You wish.

760
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:17,102
What's this?

761
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:18,834
Nothing.

762
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:28,173
These are fIy. You did these?

763
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:32,522
Yeah, but it was just
me fooIing around, though.

764
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:35,881
This ain't somebody just fooIing around.

765
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,832
This is good, Rashad.

766
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:50,421
Is this me?

767
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,352
-My mouth is not that big.
-Hey.

768
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:58,813
It's artistic expression.

769
00:54:58,848 --> 00:55:04,141
And I'm sensitive about my shit,
so I'd appreciate it....

770
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,005
Thank you.

771
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,697
Cute.

772
00:55:07,732 --> 00:55:10,259
But for reaI, Rashad...

773
00:55:10,294 --> 00:55:11,916
...you got taIent.

774
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:15,145
-I don't know.
-Like you can't have no taIent.

775
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,882
Be reaI with me. Come on.

776
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:20,039
Be reaI with me. I'm serious.

777
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:22,632
AII right.

778
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:27,094
WeII, when I was younger,
every Sunday...

779
00:55:27,129 --> 00:55:29,045
...my pops used to give me...

780
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,075
...the comics out the of Sunday paper.

781
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:36,295
I guess I kind of had this dream...

782
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,451
...that one day I couId be the one...

783
00:55:40,486 --> 00:55:42,599
...who drew the comics
in the Sunday paper.

784
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:47,474
-That's it.
-You stiII can.

785
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,160
What's happening, UncIe G?

786
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:04,820
How you doing this morning?

787
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,852
Get myseIf some orange juice.
Good morning, brother.

788
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:18,138
-Good morning, UncIe George.
-What's happening?

789
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:21,086
What is y'aII so happy about?

790
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:25,117
How come you here grinning?
You just grinning.

791
00:56:25,152 --> 00:56:27,425
Grinning, Iike you
a new man or something.

792
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,348
No, Rashad's a New New man.
He got some cutty Iast night.

793
00:56:31,383 --> 00:56:32,275
Shut up.

794
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:36,075
You got some booty
in this house?

795
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:38,375
I toId you I don't want
no company in my house.

796
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,750
I toId you I don't want
them fast girIs in my house.

797
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:43,517
No femaIes in this house, that's the ruIe.

798
00:56:43,552 --> 00:56:46,339
There's a one-bowI ruIe in effect.

799
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,111
Okay, UncIe George.

800
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,351
One bowI.

801
00:56:57,878 --> 00:56:59,238
What is with you?

802
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,403
I ain't gonna Iie.

803
00:57:02,438 --> 00:57:05,610
-I got some cutty Iast night.
-Stop Iying.

804
00:57:05,645 --> 00:57:07,191
You ain't got no cutty.

805
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,007
With your IittIe scrawny ass.

806
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:12,378
If anybody gets some cutty,
it's supposed to be me.

807
00:57:12,413 --> 00:57:15,166
I gets the booty here.
I gets the drawers.

808
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:16,573
I gets the booty. I gets the trim.

809
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:19,362
I'm the one supposed to be getting cutty.
I'm a grown man.

810
00:57:19,397 --> 00:57:22,589
I get the cutty, not y'aII.
Understand what I'm saying?

811
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:23,899
UncIe George. Me.

812
00:57:23,934 --> 00:57:27,678
WeII, I guess we see
who didn't get the cutty Iast night, huh?

813
00:57:27,713 --> 00:57:29,929
Give me my cereaI.

814
00:57:29,964 --> 00:57:31,976
I hope your IittIe weenie faII off.

815
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,426
You say something?

816
00:57:35,783 --> 00:57:36,994
-No, man, Iet me see this.
-See what?

817
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:40,443
This thing gonna make
her neck turn green.

818
00:57:40,478 --> 00:57:43,439
Man, shut up, man.
It got the 1 4-karat stamp on it.

819
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:46,438
I don't know how you bought that.
You never bought a girI anything.

820
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:48,767
-So what, man?
-You need to watch it, Rashad.

821
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,793
This girI got your nose wide open.

822
00:57:50,828 --> 00:57:51,936
Let you teII it.

823
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:55,179
Yeah, it ain't even Iike that.
She reaI, man.

824
00:57:55,214 --> 00:57:58,252
He bought a cheap-ass neckIace
for New New.

825
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:01,772
I was about to buy her some shit, man.

826
00:58:01,807 --> 00:58:03,219
-Yeah, right.
-We gotta go, man.

827
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:04,544
It's my first day, B.

828
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:06,551
K.K. SouI Food.

829
00:58:06,586 --> 00:58:08,940
I'm with my peopIe now, homey.

830
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:10,597
Free coIIards. Free coIIard greens.

831
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:11,659

It's not aIways what you know.

874
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,125
Sometimes it's who you know.

893
01:01:53,304 --> 01:01:54,416
Strange chick.

894
01:01:54,451 --> 01:01:57,477
Erin, nice to meet you.

895
01:01:57,512 --> 01:02:01,451
It's aIways a pIeasure
meeting new peopIe.

896
01:02:01,486 --> 01:02:03,667
It's nice to meet you too.

897
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,911
You're not teIIing Rashad.

898
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:25,509
Wow, you even taIk different.

899
01:02:25,544 --> 01:02:27,222
You're not teIIing him.

900
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:30,106
Oh, I'm teIIing him. PIease beIieve that.

901
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:32,664
You're not saying anything to him...

902
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:34,915
...and I'm not teIIing my dad about you.

903
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,454
If I teII him where you're from,
you're done.

904
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:39,536
-Is that a threat?
-CaII it what you want.

905
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:42,556
I gotta teII him in my own way.

906
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:50,644
I knew it. Because Rashad was
teIIing me how ''New New is this'' ...

907
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,078
...and ''New New's so reaI.''

908
01:02:52,113 --> 01:02:53,966
-I am reaI.
-You ain't shit.

909
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:55,477
Excuse you?

910
01:02:56,844 --> 01:02:58,532
How did you even find Cascade?

911
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:02,742
What, you go buy you a 99-cent ghetto
handbook to show you how to keep it reaI?

912
01:03:11,098 --> 01:03:12,877
The saIad fork goes on the other side.

913
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,044
I'm from the Trey.

914
01:03:17,368 --> 01:03:20,522
You from the Trey? That's funny.

915
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:23,576
-WeII, my dad is.
-I never read that.

916
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:26,891
-He never taIks about it.
-I don't bIame him.

917
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:29,177
Are you serious?

918
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:31,518
He's a seIIout.

919
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,974
You reaIIy wanna be ghetto.

920
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:40,196
BeIieve me, you can have
the piss in the haIIway.

921
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:41,878
I'II take the Picasso.

922
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:45,866
You got a Picasso in your house!

923
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:48,197
You need to Iower your voice. Shut up.

924
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:51,577
I bet when you go to Brinton,
you won't be aII up in here...

925
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:52,941
...doing aII that New New stuff.

926
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,689
I'm not going to Brinton.

927
01:03:54,724 --> 01:03:57,556
-I'm going to SpeIman.
-Oh, you going to SpeIman.

928
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,425

01:04:11,492 --> 01:04:12,425
Yo, what happened?

930
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,027
She took care of me in the parking Iot.

931
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:17,051
-No.
-Yeah, that right.

932
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,749

940
01:04:54,622 --> 01:04:56,904
-I ain't seen him either.
-Rashad. Rashad.

941
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:58,875
Rashad, Ant just got arrested.

942
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:00,701
-Come on, they got your brother.

943
01:05:00,736 --> 01:05:03,452

Come on, boss. Let me be out.

01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:40,408
Thank you, man.

950
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,499
It's aII part of the game, young buck.

Now aII you got to do is

You have to get in the house

-Thought so. Anton, get your ass out the car.

-You just been getting over.
-Getting over?

998
01:08:30,597 --> 01:08:32,534
Boy.

999
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:34,611
You best....

1000
01:08:37,327 --> 01:08:38,913
Yeah, right.

1001
01:08:41,907 --> 01:08:44,596
I ain't never wanted none of this.

1002
01:08:47,348 --> 01:08:50,146
Pushing a damn broom the rest of my Iife.
I'm 41 years oId.

1003
01:08:50,181 --> 01:08:51,618
I'm a grown-ass man.

1004
01:08:52,964 --> 01:08:55,155
You see a decent car sitting
out in that driveway?

1005
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,371
You see women roIIing through here?

1006
01:08:57,406 --> 01:08:59,689
-That's your fauIt, man.
-HeII, no.

1007
01:08:59,724 --> 01:09:06,400
Because don't no woman want no man
with two dumb-ass kids and no money.

1008
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,092
A janitor.

1009
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:12,291
Shit, I'm a janitor. A janitor.

1010
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:16,253
Boy.

1011
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:19,436
Yeah, I shouId've just Iet
y'aII's asses go to foster care.

1012
01:09:20,998 --> 01:09:22,965
Then I wouIdn't even be in this mess.

1013
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:27,709
What?

1014
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:38,035
-Hello?
-Hey.

1015
01:09:39,663 --> 01:09:40,828
Can you meet me somewhere?

1016
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:56,739
-Hi.
-Hey.

1017
01:10:09,723 --> 01:10:11,422
Why are we here on oId peopIe's night?

1018
01:10:21,657 --> 01:10:22,739
They from CoIIege Park.

1019
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:24,960
How you know that?

1020
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,906
Every side of town got
their own way of skating.

1021
01:10:28,944 --> 01:10:30,417
They got, Iike, a IittIe bounce to them.

1022
01:10:33,106 --> 01:10:37,759
That's Chicago. And that's Detroit
aII day Iong, right there.

1023
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:46,101
You taIk to Esquire today?

1024
01:10:49,097 --> 01:10:50,191
Ain't seen him aII day.

1025
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:51,637
Why?

1026
01:10:51,672 --> 01:10:56,054
Nothing, I was just....

1027
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:00,405
Rashad?

1028
01:11:01,892 --> 01:11:03,919
I kind of have something
I need to teII you.

1029
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,642
If it's bad...

1030
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:10,252
...I don't even wanna hear it.

1031
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,999
Got enough shitty news for one day.

1032
01:11:14,034 --> 01:11:15,489
What's wrong?

1033
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,229
Everything.

1034
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:20,489
My Iife's a mess right now.

1035
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:24,769
Just tired of being Iied to.

1036
01:11:27,027 --> 01:11:29,017
I keep trying to think of
what my pops wouId do.

1037
01:11:31,428 --> 01:11:33,483
Can't come up with nothing.

1038
01:11:34,772 --> 01:11:36,540
Hey...

1039
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,749
...it's gonna be okay.

1040
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:43,175
Hope you right, shorty.

1041
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:49,560
Hey.

1042
01:11:50,612 --> 01:11:52,315
I'm starting to think this is our song.

1043
01:11:53,865 --> 01:11:55,252
Oh, yeah?

1044
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,905
Too bad we didn't bring our skates,
though, huh?

1045
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:06,733
Hey, babies, how y'aII doing?

1046
01:12:06,768 --> 01:12:08,499
AII right, now. Be carefuI, babies.

1047
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,244
Oh, man, is that the twins' mama?

1048
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:17,284
-Man.
-Ms. GayIe is a hot mess.

1049
01:12:18,445 --> 01:12:21,643
I was gonna wait tiII Sunday,
but I got something for you.

1050
01:12:21,678 --> 01:12:23,055
What?

1051
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:29,737
Thank you.

1052
01:12:30,867 --> 01:12:32,080
Watch yourseIf.

1053
01:12:33,953 --> 01:12:35,867
It's beautifuI.

1054
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:39,736
-I'm gIad you Iike it.
-I Iove it.

1055
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:51,437
It's time we had a brother-to-brother talk.

1056
01:13:51,472 --> 01:13:55,139
Or to put it delicately,
a talk about the birds and the bees.

1057
01:13:56,538 --> 01:13:59,245
At 1 3, girls are just like comic books...

1058
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,376
...loaded with adventure,
easy to understand...

1059
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:04,973
...and don't cost more
than a quarter to take out.

1060
01:14:05,008 --> 01:14:07,944
In this house, we never
discussed our problems.

1061
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,867
We just watched Good Times.
It seemed like the answer to everything.

1062
01:14:12,902 --> 01:14:17,059
When you get a little older, I'll teach you
how to handle yourself in the NFL of love.

1063
01:14:19,807 --> 01:14:22,129
My pops always told me
to take care of my little brother.

1064
01:14:23,223 --> 01:14:24,657
I hope I got through to him.

1065
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:48,762
Here we go. It's gonna be
a Iong night for some of y'aII.

1066
01:14:48,797 --> 01:14:51,581
We got the Warriors, the Preps
and the Ones in the house tonight, baby.

1067
01:14:53,704 --> 01:14:56,138
Look, you see them boys
practicing their moves.

1068
01:14:56,173 --> 01:14:59,116
Tonight we break out the secret weapon.
Y'aII remember how?

1069
01:14:59,151 --> 01:15:01,839
-I'm gonna break it down. For reaI.
-I remember, I got it.

1070
01:15:01,874 --> 01:15:03,398
No, no, no, Iike this here:

1071
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:05,462
So...and...and...?

1072
01:15:05,497 --> 01:15:10,474
-You got a crick in your neck?
-HeII, no. Come on, man.

1073
01:15:10,509 --> 01:15:12,023
-Watch what I'm about to do. HoId up, man.
-Watch.

1074
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:15,073
-Before you mess us up again.
-Watch.

1075
01:15:16,597 --> 01:15:18,932
-What's up, y'aII?
-Hey, what's happening?

1076
01:15:18,967 --> 01:15:21,389
-Oh, you wanna hug me.
-We gotta go.

1077
01:15:21,424 --> 01:15:23,072
-We gotta go. Ma's coming.
-See you.

1078
01:15:23,955 --> 01:15:27,120
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

1079
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,277
I just bagged the shorty
that work at the snack bar.

1080
01:15:30,312 --> 01:15:32,404
Free hot wings. Let's go, baby. Come on!

1081
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:35,132
-WeII, heII, yeah. Come on.
-What? We ain't gotta chase no chicken.

1082
01:15:44,611 --> 01:15:46,052
PrisciIIa, it's Janice.

1083
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:51,237
I have some disturbing news
to share with you.

1084
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,340
Shut up!

1085
01:16:08,578 --> 01:16:09,774
What they caII this, Star?

1086
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:12,409
Damn, who is you?

1087
01:16:13,296 --> 01:16:15,013
He a retired rapper or something.

1088
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:17,569
Attitude.

1089
01:16:17,604 --> 01:16:21,005
He do got a attitude,
but his car is cute, though.

1090
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,175
-I Iike that. Let's touch it.
-Okay.

1091
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,393
Let's go.

1092
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:32,388
-Bambi's Iike a ghetto taIe.
-How?

1093
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:35,446
Moms gets shot in the head.
She ain't doing nothing.

1094
01:16:35,481 --> 01:16:39,429
Pops is never there.
House gets burned down, insurance reasons.

1095
01:16:39,464 --> 01:16:42,073
And out of nowhere, she pregnant.

1096
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:53,985
You feeI what I'm saying? House
burned down, he meets a girI, then--

1097
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:59,081
-Dad, how did you--?
-Let's go. Erin, get up, now.

1098
01:17:03,362 --> 01:17:06,015
That's your fauIt, man.
How you gonna Iet him take your girI?

1099
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:08,894
See, if she were with me--
Oh, you gonna shush me now, huh?

1100
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:10,543
Why you ain't shushing the oId man?

1101
01:17:10,578 --> 01:17:14,444
See, now you wanna get buck, man.
He gone, now. He gone, fooI.

1102
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:15,610
Get in.

1103
01:17:17,642 --> 01:17:19,687
-Yo, what's up?
-Where you going?

1104
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,936
-It's aII right, it's my dad.
-It's your daddy?

1105
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,419
Is he stiII with your mama?

1106
01:17:47,858 --> 01:18:06,796
Keep it up, hear?
Keep it up. Lie to me again.

1107
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:08,074
Lie to me again.

1108
01:18:11,263 --> 01:18:12,949
What'd you say?
Get back down here!

1109
01:18:15,099 --> 01:18:16,605
How couId you humiIiate me Iike that?

1110
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,642
You were supposed to be over at HoIIy's
house getting some rest before practice.

1111
01:18:21,224 --> 01:18:23,829
Baby, you been Iying...

1112
01:18:24,847 --> 01:18:26,707
...about where you been going
and who you been with.

1113
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:28,652
What if something happened to you?

1114
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:30,555
I'm sorry, Mom.

1115
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:34,096
Why can't I pick my friends
and choose things in Iife for myseIf?

1116
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:37,645
Because you're not making
very good choices, baby.

1117
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:41,042
I mean, you got a Iot of
good opportunities to choose from.

1118
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:45,555
Like what? Going to Brinton?

1119
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:46,820
Oh, baby.

1120
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:50,400
SpeIman is a great schooI,
but your father and I just--

1121
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:52,036
-But what?
-WeII, we're saying...

1122
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:54,064
...Iook at some other choices,
some other options.

1123
01:18:54,099 --> 01:18:56,251
-What?
-Keep taIking to Mother Iike that...

1124
01:18:56,286 --> 01:18:57,883
...and your Iips wiII beat you
to the hospitaI.

1125
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:03,143
You know how Iucky you are?

1126
01:19:03,178 --> 01:19:06,477
Yes, Daddy.
I do know that I am very fortunate.

1127
01:19:06,512 --> 01:19:08,421
Thank you for being a great parent.

1128
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:13,690
But I knew if I were to ask to go over there,
you wouId've had a heart attack!

1129
01:19:13,725 --> 01:19:15,873
You damn right! You know why?
Because I was that guy.

1130
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:17,302
I know what he wanted from you.

1131
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:19,115
And it wasn't them big-ass earrings.

1132
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:22,632
Why do you aIways think somebody
aIways wants something?

1133
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,688
I work too hard.
I don't wanna see you go down--

1134
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:26,421
I don't have to expIain myseIf.

1135
01:19:26,456 --> 01:19:29,660
Why? If you don't have to expIain,
I don't have to expIain.

1136
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:30,802
Because I said so!

1137
01:19:33,217 --> 01:19:34,626
You better go to bed now.

1138
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,232
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1139
01:19:38,267 --> 01:19:39,478
Let's just caIm down...

1140
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:43,315
...and coIIect ourseIves,
and taIk about this in the morning.

1141
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,732
There's nothing more to taIk about.

1142
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:46,794
End of conversation.

1143
01:20:01,162 --> 01:20:02,222
Yo, man, you aII right?

1144
01:20:05,478 --> 01:20:06,743
Just checking on you, man.

1145
01:20:08,782 --> 01:20:09,918
You knew, huh?

1146
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,246
AII this time.

1147
01:20:15,324 --> 01:20:17,280
That was the same car
from the Garnett's house.

1148
01:20:22,266 --> 01:20:24,115
Man....

1149
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,403
That's fouI, man.

1150
01:20:29,183 --> 01:20:32,071
-Look, man, I'm sorry, I--
-Hey, hey, hey.

1151
01:20:32,106 --> 01:20:34,243
Man, get out.

1152
01:20:34,278 --> 01:20:35,482
-But just hear me out, man.
-Bounce.

1153
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:38,987
I don't wanna see you, taIk to you,
kick it with you, skate with you.

1154
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:40,277
Nothing, man.

1155
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:46,766
-Come on.
-You stiII here?

1156
01:20:49,128 --> 01:20:50,624
I'm gone.

1157
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:53,597
What you gonna do with it, man?

1158
01:20:53,632 --> 01:20:55,350
-Hey-- What up, man?
-Yeah.

1159
01:20:55,385 --> 01:20:57,927
And the rest of y'aII niggas, man,
get the fuck off my porch.

1160
01:20:57,962 --> 01:21:00,441
-What we do?
-Man, you heard me, homes.

1161
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:02,614
Hey, you ain't gotta teII me twice.

1162
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,143
-Yeah, weII, bust a move then, partner.
-Was it me?

1163
01:21:05,178 --> 01:21:08,081
Man, I think it was your breath.
It usuaIIy is.

1164
01:21:08,116 --> 01:21:11,046
Whatever, man. You aIways eating
those sunfIowers, you country.

1165
01:21:11,081 --> 01:21:13,795
-Hey, hey.
-I'm teII-- It's the A-Town.

1166
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:15,035
HoId it, now.

1167
01:22:27,154 --> 01:22:28,437
-John.
-Yeah?

1168
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:36,937
Not Iike pIaying goIf, is it, boy?

1169
01:22:40,313 --> 01:22:41,386
Look, sir, this is fun...

1170
01:22:44,026 --> 01:22:47,058
-...but I came to taIk to you.
-What about?

1171
01:22:55,897 --> 01:22:57,823
I came to give you this back.

1172
01:22:59,907 --> 01:23:01,128
Did I make an error somewhere?

1173
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:05,678
No, I made the mistake.

1174
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:09,035
Not being honest with you before.

1175
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:11,127
What about?

1176
01:23:13,014 --> 01:23:15,511
I Iive five bIocks away from Cascade's
on the south side.

1177
01:23:17,822 --> 01:23:21,540
-You said you went to Mount Paran.
-I do.

1178
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:25,562
I use the cIub address
to go to schooI in a better district.

1179
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:28,952
So you're just a Iiar?

1180
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,859
My parents can't afford
to send me to private schooI, sir.

1181
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:40,849
So you knew Erin before you met me?

1182
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,904
Yes, I knew Erin.

1183
01:23:45,495 --> 01:23:47,497
-But I didn't know you was her father.
-You expect me to beIieve that?

1184
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:53,103
-I got your game, Ben.
-My game?

1185
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:56,104
I don't pIay games, Mr. Garnett.

1186
01:23:56,139 --> 01:23:58,919
That's one thing I do not do
is pIay games.

1187
01:23:58,954 --> 01:24:01,600
I'm too busy trying to make it out.

1188
01:24:01,635 --> 01:24:05,089
I figured you knew that,
coming up on the south side.

1189
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:09,411
As far as the Ietter, I just thought the Ietter
wouId give me a better shot, that's aII.

1190
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:15,569
We'II never know now, wiII we?
You can Iet yourseIf out.

1191
01:24:30,009 --> 01:24:32,659
You know, I read in this articIe...

1192
01:24:32,694 --> 01:24:36,763
...where you said being a CEO
didn't make you a proud man...

1193
01:24:38,076 --> 01:24:40,202
...being a proud man made you a CEO.

1194
01:24:41,913 --> 01:24:43,967
But a proud man doesn't hide
where he comes from.

1195
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:45,226
Be carefuI.

1196
01:24:45,261 --> 01:24:48,936
See, with or without that Ietter,
I'm gonna make it.

1197
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:52,356
And I won't forget MechanicsviIIe, Georgia,
made me who I am.

1198
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:56,607
With aII due respect, sir,
it made you who you are.

1199
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:59,634
Might heIp your daughter
to know that too.

1200
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:34,787
Come on.

1201
01:26:55,685 --> 01:26:56,871
HoIIer at your boy, man.

1202
01:26:56,906 --> 01:26:58,735
I made them come...

1203
01:27:00,235 --> 01:27:01,659
...so you wouIdn't kick my ass.

1204
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:07,265
Man, come on, dog. Damn.

1205
01:27:09,035 --> 01:27:13,608
Man, we friends, man.
We boys. Hear him out.

1206
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:20,220
I just wanted to say sorry.

1207
01:27:22,163 --> 01:27:25,606
And if it mean anything to you,
I gave the Ietter back.

1208
01:27:26,831 --> 01:27:28,429
What you do that for?

1209
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,829
-Hope you ain't think it was for me.
-It was for me.

1210
01:27:35,197 --> 01:27:37,283
I didn't want it Iike that.

1211
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:39,885
Hey, Iook, man.
We about to go to Cascade.

1212
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,136
Now, tonight is our night.

1213
01:27:41,171 --> 01:27:43,362
You aIready know what it is,
homeboy.

1214
01:27:43,397 --> 01:27:46,274
I mean, we're Iike the Yankees, baby.
We're Iike--

1215
01:27:46,309 --> 01:27:49,279
We're Iike the BuIIs in the '90s.
We're Iike the Lakers.

1216
01:27:50,471 --> 01:27:54,020
No, not the Lakers.
But we're a dynasty.

1217
01:27:54,055 --> 01:27:58,214
When we're out on that rink,
nobody can touch us, man.

1218
01:27:58,249 --> 01:28:00,874
Nobody. Let's go.

1219
01:28:05,487 --> 01:28:10,033
No. I'm gonna Iet y'aII have it.
I don't skate no more.

1220
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:12,526
Oh, man, you acting Iike a femaIe, man.

1221
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:15,125
-HeII, man.
-Yeah, whatever.

1222
01:28:26,192 --> 01:28:29,234
Ladies and gentIemen, this is the moment
you've aII been waiting for.

1223
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:30,483
Skate Wars is here.

1224
01:28:40,754 --> 01:28:51,520
I just got word Rashad Swann
ain't here tonight...

1225
01:28:51,555 --> 01:28:53,291
...so the Ones are not in competition.

1226
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:55,464
Damn. This sucks, man.

1227
01:28:57,694 --> 01:29:01,866
-It reaIIy sucks.
-Hey, man, my arm is skinnier.

1228
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:05,289
No, no, no. Your arm ain't skinnier,
your face got bigger.

1229
01:29:05,324 --> 01:29:09,107
-Hate to put it to you Iike that, man, hey.
-You Iaughing, and we're gonna Iose.

1230
01:29:19,481 --> 01:29:22,321
I ain't been down here in a whiIe.
Love what you've done with the pIace.

1231
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:31,851
Yeah, Iooks Iike you reaIIy Iet
your IittIe partners piss you off.

1232
01:29:35,907 --> 01:29:37,483
I don't wanna taIk about it.

1233
01:29:37,518 --> 01:29:41,068
Boy, I just came to teII you
there's some Iemonade upstairs.

1234
01:29:43,019 --> 01:29:44,557
Best batch I ever made too.

1235
01:29:49,603 --> 01:29:50,902
Now, that's good.

1236
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,847
Now, Iook, I ain't trying
to get in your business...

1237
01:29:56,882 --> 01:30:01,090
...but, I mean, I do know
a IittIe something about being pissed.

1238
01:30:03,677 --> 01:30:06,834
I mean, it's aII--
You know, it's aII just feeIings, man.

1239
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:09,890
From femaIes to friends to funeraIs...

1240
01:30:09,925 --> 01:30:13,737
...it's aII about the feeIings.

1241
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,517
I just want you to recognize
the difference...

1242
01:30:18,552 --> 01:30:23,740
...between what you feeI
and what's reaI.

1243
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:35,676
That way you don't Iook back on Iife
with a bunch of regret.

1244
01:30:54,412 --> 01:30:57,499
-What's happening?
-This Ant?

1245
01:30:57,534 --> 01:31:00,877
-No, this ain't Ant. Who is this?
-Is this little big brother?

1246
01:31:00,912 --> 01:31:03,362
What the heII is you caIIing my house for,
man?

1247
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:06,716
The streetlight's on
and our boy ain't come home yet.

1248
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:08,327
I'm gonna have to get out here
and go find him.

1249
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:11,549
HeII is you taIking about?
My brother ain't your business no more.

1250
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:15,348
Like hell. y eah, and he ain't
into me for two G's either.

1251
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:19,033
And I ain't about to put some hot shit
in his chest, you know what I'm saying?

1252
01:31:19,068 --> 01:31:21,762
You better stay away
from my IittIe brother, partner.

1253
01:31:21,797 --> 01:31:23,343
Boy, stop.

1254
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,988
What's up, Ant?

1255
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:56,067
I ain't heard from you in a whiIe, boy.
Boy, where you been?

1256
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:58,467
No, no, I-- I'm cooI.

1257
01:31:59,891 --> 01:32:02,293
I mean, I'm cooI.
It's just taking me a minute, that's aII.

1258
01:32:03,738 --> 01:32:05,983
But I'm gonna straighten everything out
as soon as I get that money.

1259
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,791
Cognac.

1260
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:25,982
Remember what I toId you, right?

1261
01:32:27,437 --> 01:32:30,330
-Yeah.
-What'd I say?

1262
01:32:31,783 --> 01:32:34,328
-It's grown-man business.
-It's grown-man business.

1263
01:32:36,097 --> 01:32:40,364
Got your ass.

1264
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:44,147
Scared as heII, man.

1265
01:32:56,132 --> 01:32:59,583
-Goddamn, CarI Lewis, where you going?
-Come on, man, pIease.

1266
01:32:59,618 --> 01:33:03,362
PIease what?
What? What? PIease what?

1267
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,169
Boy, you're shaking Iike a stripper.
Tighten up.

1268
01:33:08,214 --> 01:33:09,891
I'm so disappointed in you this evening.

1269
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:16,202
Look at me when I'm taIking to you, boy.

1270
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:19,553
I know that ain't who I think it is.

1271
01:33:21,316 --> 01:33:23,140
-LittIe big brother.
-Get in the car, Ant.

1272
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:25,671
I toId you to Ieave my brother aIone.

1273
01:33:25,706 --> 01:33:28,148
-Y'aII so funny.
-You got a probIem, you deaI with me.

1274
01:33:28,183 --> 01:33:30,624
-Nigga, who the heII is you?
-He owe you some money?

1275
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:32,929
-Here you go.
-Oh, shit.

1276
01:33:32,964 --> 01:33:35,264
-Yeah, I'm tired--
-That was so disrespectfuI.

1277
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:39,004
You done hit me in my mouth
with some goddamn money.

1278
01:33:43,459 --> 01:33:44,399
Yeah.

1279
01:33:44,434 --> 01:33:46,688
You don't get it, do you?

1280
01:33:48,351 --> 01:33:49,748
I'm his daddy now.

1281
01:33:57,313 --> 01:33:58,096
Get out the way.

1282
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:11,058
Pleasure turns to the pain

1283
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:14,016
Of the lessons learned from the strain
Of the questions burned in my brain

1284
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:17,244
About whether love is humane
In its touch.

1285
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:19,567
These thoughts are like salmon

1286
01:34:19,602 --> 01:34:21,514
Swimming upstream
In the tears of your deceit

1287
01:34:22,527 --> 01:34:24,970
Fighting the current hurt
That kills more than is created

1288
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:26,929
By the chaos of our intertwined emotions

1289
01:34:28,017 --> 01:34:30,123
Chaotic because the anchor
Of Eros' arrow

1290
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:32,968
Has been plucked from the vessel
Of my undying infatuation

1291
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:36,378
Separation not as simple
As the distance between us

1292
01:34:37,178 --> 01:34:39,217
My mind no longer possessed
By the demons

1293
01:34:39,252 --> 01:34:42,284
That had been the overseers
Of my enslavement to your lies

1294
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:45,185
The seeds of these lies
Rooted so deeply

1295
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,986
They have cracked the foundation
Of what we once shared

1296
01:34:48,853 --> 01:34:52,094
Allowing the faith in us I had sealed inside
To gush out like a river

1297
01:34:52,129 --> 01:34:55,279
Ripping the image of our future together
From my thoughts

1298
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:58,329
As violently and as brutally
As if it were a child being taken

1299
01:34:58,364 --> 01:34:59,805
From his mother's arms

1300
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,417
I'm left surrounded in darkness

1301
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:04,508
But I refuse to be swallowed by it

1302
01:35:04,543 --> 01:35:09,505
My loneliness like the night air.
Invisible to the eye, obvious to the touch

1303
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,374
In its cold uncomfortableness

1304
01:35:12,409 --> 01:35:14,627
y et if I could do it all over again

1305
01:35:14,662 --> 01:35:16,835
I'd do it in the same skin I'm in

1306
01:35:18,037 --> 01:35:19,567
To lay down and let love die

1307
01:35:19,602 --> 01:35:21,494
Just stay down and let love lie

1308
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:25,027
No, no, not I

1309
01:35:25,062 --> 01:35:27,412
I'll stay 'round and let love fly

1310
01:35:27,447 --> 01:35:30,923
Even though I have seen
Its darkest form, deceit

1311
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:34,317
Nothing else could taste this warm
Or feel this sweet

1312
01:35:58,555 --> 01:36:00,270
So you gonna stay mad at me forever?

1313
01:36:05,771 --> 01:36:07,486
It ain't even about that, bro.

1314
01:36:12,073 --> 01:36:15,820
I mean, Iike, when you was a baby,
I couIdn't waIk for you.

1315
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:19,165
And I can't waIk for you now.

1316
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:22,631
I'm sorry.

1317
01:36:23,823 --> 01:36:26,447
-Rashad, I'm not gonna be messing up.
-Hey, Ant.

1318
01:36:28,787 --> 01:36:30,376
I Iove you, regardIess.

1319
01:36:30,411 --> 01:36:33,345
I can teach you everything
under the sun...

1320
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:36,190
...but I can't be a man for you.

1321
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:41,402
You gotta figure out
the best way to do that yourseIf.

1322
01:36:54,074 --> 01:36:55,833
We didn't win Skate Wars that night.

1323
01:36:55,868 --> 01:36:57,312
But I got something better.

1324
01:36:57,347 --> 01:37:03,378
I got my friends, I got my girl,
and I got my little brother back.

1325
01:37:06,066 --> 01:37:08,108
Teddy finally graduated from high school.

1326
01:37:08,143 --> 01:37:12,165
He even opened up his own spot.
He call it ''Gangsta Grills. ''

1327
01:37:13,607 --> 01:37:14,926
But see, that's what I wanted, though.

1328
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:17,795
Okay, weII, hey, if that what you want,
I got my money, we straight.

1329
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:19,691
-That's right.
-There it is.

1330
01:37:25,421 --> 01:37:27,601
Brooklyn finally found a job
he could keep.

1331
01:37:30,889 --> 01:37:32,799
CongratuIations.

1332
01:37:43,422 --> 01:37:46,037
Esquire got a mysterious
letter of recommendation...

1333
01:37:46,072 --> 01:37:47,601
...for the Falcon Scholarship.

1334
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:50,489
Guess Garnett ain't so bad after all.

1335
01:37:51,567 --> 01:37:53,603
My boy's in the Ivy League.

1336
01:38:01,672 --> 01:38:03,728
Hey, get back up and try it again,
baby girIs.

1337
01:38:03,763 --> 01:38:06,750
Skateman says get back up, try it again.

1338
01:38:06,785 --> 01:38:09,709
-Get out of here.
-We know how to skate, okay?

1339
01:38:09,744 --> 01:38:11,545
-We getting up.
-This is so embarrassing.

1340
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,579
Twins, well, they still at Cascade
every Sunday night.

1341
01:38:14,614 --> 01:38:16,454
Ghetto fabulous.

1342
01:38:18,369 --> 01:38:20,647
Uncle George quit dealing
with them dating services...

1343
01:38:20,682 --> 01:38:22,925
...and went to church
and got him a real woman.

1344
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,686
She's nice.

1345
01:38:28,864 --> 01:38:32,298
New New finally convinced her parents
that Spelman was right for her.

1346
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:34,628
I'm glad she's close.

1347
01:38:48,332 --> 01:38:50,757
My little brother let go of all his
dope-boy ambitions...

1348
01:38:50,792 --> 01:38:52,396
...and finally got it together.

1349
01:38:52,431 --> 01:38:54,559
I'm proud of him.

1350
01:39:00,952 --> 01:39:01,916
As for me...

1351
01:39:01,951 --> 01:39:04,748
...I never realized I was dreaming
all along...

1352
01:39:04,783 --> 01:39:06,872
...because I was always drawing.

1353
01:39:15,723 --> 01:39:19,971
My pop said I'd put these skates down
when I found something more important.

1354
01:39:20,006 --> 01:39:21,997
I think he was right.

1355
01:39:27,501 --> 01:39:29,581
This is the beginning.

1356
01:43:20,774 --> 01:43:26,221
