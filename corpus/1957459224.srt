1
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:16,099
One of the greatest needs God has put
into the heart of every human being

2
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:18,123
is for a father.

3
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:25,722
All of us have a fatherhood story.

4
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,407
We either can share
about how much we loved him

5
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:33,181
and how much he meant to us...

6
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,732
or how deeply he hurt us.

7
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,628
We see father wounds all around us.

8
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:50,027
The hurt, the bitterness...

9
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:52,632
the anger...

10
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,122
the unforgiveness.

11
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,675
People who've grown up without a dad

12
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,199
that was present
or loving in their homes...

13
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:09,939
the word "father"
is not a good word for them.

14
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:13,505
They're seeing the brokenness
of this world. They're struggling

15
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:16,462
in their marriages. They're trying
to provide for their families.

16
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,507
And they don't know
that they have a father.

17
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:23,906
And his heart is tender towards us.

18
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:30,249
If you've been looking for a father,
if you've been wanting a daddy...

19
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:37,729
if you want to experience
what it is to be fathered by God...

20
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:45,753
your perfect Father in heaven
can change the trajectory of your life.

21
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,930
Your daddy wants to restore you.

22
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,545
There is a loving Father
in heaven who has created us.

23
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,389
And He wants a relationship with us.

24
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:11,303
I got a full scholarship
to go to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

25
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:16,327
The Seattle Seahawks drafted me in 1976.

26
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,218
I played seven years
with the Seattle Seahawks.

27
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:26,307
After that, that's when I got
into my teaching and coaching career.

28
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,308
I love coaching
because of the relationships

29
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,873
that you develop with the players.

30
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,048
You get close with guys.

31
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,701
Mental part is what makes the difference,

32
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:39,006
doing the little stuff right,
because everybody's got physical talent.

33
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,007
And so they know
who I am and what I'm all about.

34
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,703
And that they know that I care about them.
They know that... I care about you.

35
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,356
I want you to be successful.

36
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,445
The crowd settles in for Super Bowl XXXIV.

37
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:56,576
-St. Louis against Tennessee.
-We went to a Super Bowl in Tennessee.

38
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,011
We were the Houston Oilers,
then we moved to Tennessee.

39
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:03,229
-We became the Tennessee Titans.
-Into the end zone.

40
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,056
I was hired by Pete Carroll.

41
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,449
I got to go back to Seattle
and spend seven years on his staff.

42
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,537
Went to the playoffs
six out of seven years

43
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,494
and two straight Super Bowls.

44
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:16,755
I would always tell my players,
"If all you get from me is someone

45
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,929
that teaches you
how to run the inside zone,

46
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,800
someone that teaches you
how to run an option route,

47
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:26,149
if that's all you get from me,
man, you can get that from a video."

48
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:29,759
I said, "I pray that I give you something
that will take you beyond this,

49
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:33,629
that will help you become a better man,
a better husband, a better father."

50
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:37,152
I wanna make a difference
in the lives of young people,

51
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:39,762
the way my father
made a difference in my life.

52
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:43,632
And I would look at each guy that way,
like, "You are my son,"

53
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:45,850
in the way I will relate to him.

54
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:53,749
As a father would relate to a son,
as my father related to me.

55
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:59,245
My dad was my hero growing up.

56
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:02,332
His presence in our life...

57
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:08,290
how he saw more in us
than what we saw in ourselves.

58
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:10,421
Speaking to me as a Black young man,

59
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:16,597
not to hear the noise
that I was hearing from other people...

60
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:19,859
who was trying to tell us that,
"You are limited in what you could do

61
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:25,121
and where you can live
and what you can be."

62
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:29,774
Not only was that lie being sold to me
by those outside of my community,

63
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:34,123
but there were people within my community
that had bought that lie also.

64
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:39,429
They was telling me,
"Going to college, you're just dreaming."

65
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:42,691
And my father wasn't buying it.

66
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,647
My father asked me a question, he said,

67
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,692
"What do you wanna do
when you graduate from high school?"

68
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:49,693
And I had a plan.

69
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:55,389
Work in the steel mill,
get a nice car, and live in an apartment.

70
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:59,608
So he took me on a trip. Got in the car,
he said, "I don't want you to say a word."

71
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,914
So we drove down
to that apartment complex,

72
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:05,436
which was a public housing unit.

73
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,829
He said, "Don't buy the lie
that this is the only place you can live."

74
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:12,656
We drove to that steel mill

75
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,787
where my dad worked
for 30-something years.

76
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:20,179
He said, "Don't buy the lie
that this is the only place you can work.

77
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:23,310
Son, you're better than that.
Don't buy the lie.

78
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:27,573
You can do more than that right there.

79
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:30,356
Hey, don't forget who your daddy is.

80
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,630
Don't forget who you are."

81
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,053
So my father, he was letting me know

82
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:43,077
my identity
was supposed to impact my behavior.

83
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:48,578
When I was in college,
I had this desire to wanna know God,

84
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,361
but I'm a visual learner.

85
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,014
I was talking
to people about Christianity,

86
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,754
they were telling me
what Jesus Christ could do for me.

87
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,841
And I was looking at these people, saying:

88
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:01,624
"Doesn't look like He's making
any difference in your life.

89
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,799
You talk like I talk,
think like I think, go where I go."

90
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:09,279
Quarterback Sherman Smith takes the ball
through the Marshall defense.

91
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:15,019
And so one day, it was my senior year,
right before the draft, I said: "God,

92
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:21,239
I wanna know if you're for real.
I need somebody to show me."

93
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:25,196
God responded and revealed Himself to me.

94
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,197
You know, training camp started,

95
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:32,023
this one guy walks in,
big Black guy, big, old barrel chest,

96
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,068
and on the back of his shirt, it said:

97
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:37,721
"Hutch is going to Seattle
to do God's battle."

98
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:40,635
And I remember thinking
to myself, "Oh, no, man. Here it is.

99
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,461
I've come some 2000 miles

100
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:45,766
to run into another one
of these 'Christians.'"

101
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,158
I'm watching Ken Hutcherson.

102
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:49,550
We're having a relationship
because we talk and stuff.

103
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:50,811
But I'm watching his life.

104
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:54,508
I'm checking him out,
gonna see what this guy's all about.

105
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:59,031
There was something different
about this guy.

106
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:03,424
In our last preseason game,
he gets hurt, blows his knee out.

107
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:06,946
Take him off the field,
word comes back down on the field

108
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,338
that his career is over with.

109
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:14,731
And he has ice packs on his knee
and he's got a smile on his face.

110
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,774
And he just says, "Sherm."

111
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:18,384
"Man, I'm excited."

112
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,210
And I'm looking at him, "Okay."

113
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:23,559
"I'm excited
to see what God has planned for my life."

114
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,691
He said, "Sherm, I'm a Christian.
And nothing happens in my life

115
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:30,300
that's not filtered
through God's hands first."

116
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:33,823
He said, "I'm excited
to see what God has planned for my life."

117
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:37,128
And right there,
I said, "This has to be for real.

118
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,259
You can't fake that right there."

119
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:45,826
And right there in that room, I said,
"Please tell me more about Jesus Christ."

120
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,740
He said, "God loves you.
God loves you so much

121
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:52,567
that your sins are forgiven,
past, present and future."

122
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,654
He said,
"Not only did God love you so much,

123
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,785
the thing that has happened
is God says He's gonna save you

124
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:01,786
from the penalty of sin. He's
gonna save you from the presence of sin.

125
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,179
But now, God
is gonna save you from the power of sin."

126
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:10,615
I said, "Lord Jesus, come into my life."

127
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,616
Identity is the key to spiritual growth.

128
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,095
You have to know who you are.

129
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:19,531
My dad laid the foundation
for that thinking.

130
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:22,662
And then when Hutch came to me
and said, "Don't you know who you are?"

131
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,271
He was saying the same thing to me.

132
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:32,295
"Don't you know your identity
is supposed to impact your behavior?"

133
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:40,579
What a father is supposed to be...

134
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:46,364
is a man who has accepted
the role and responsibility

135
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:52,452
of transferring the character,
person, and purposes of God

136
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:55,801
through him to his offspring.

137
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:59,759
A father is the founder.
We talk about Founding Fathers.

138
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:03,455
The word "father" means source
from which other things come.

139
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:07,586
It can also mean "chief" or a "leader."

140
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,414
Our Heavenly Father
is a source of blessing

141
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:15,415
and love and provision
and protection and wisdom.

142
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,064
And a father on earth

143
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,764
should be receiving those things
from his Heavenly Father

144
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:24,809
and pouring those out on his children.

145
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,853
So he is the mirror,
the model, and the imprint.

146
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:36,246
He's a mediary between heaven
and earth to the next generation.

147
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,074
The problem
is that earthly fathers crack the mirror.

148
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:50,098
So the mirror of the Heavenly Father
doesn't come through clearly.

149
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:02,340
Today on Focus on the Family,
we're gonna look at fatherlessness.

150
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:06,645
Your host is Focus president
and author, Jim Daly, and I'm John Fuller.

151
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:10,604
The research about fatherlessness
in America is heartbreaking.

152
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:14,170
Ninety percent
of all homeless and runaway children

153
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,909
are from fatherless homes.

154
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:19,388
Eighty-five percent of all children
who show behavior disorders

155
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:22,787
come from fatherless homes.

156
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,962
It really stacks the deck against us.

157
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:57,354
I know this firsthand
because most of my childhood

158
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,660
was spent without a father.

159
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:04,809
Concept of fatherhood, for me, was tough.

160
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,401
A father was somebody who hurt you,

161
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:11,620
a father was somebody
who disappointed you.

162
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:15,663
My biological father was an alcoholic.

163
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:20,317
One day, he'd run his hand
through my hair and say he loves me,

164
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:26,716
and the next night,
he'd be drunk, threatening me.

165
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:29,450
One night, I was 5 years old,

166
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:33,930
my dad was drunk,
sitting in a La-Z-Boy-type rocker,

167
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:36,670
and he had a hammer in his hand.

168
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,062
And he was banging the hammer
on the ground, saying,

169
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:43,584
"I'm gonna kill your mother
when she gets home."

170
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:47,455
I looked at the walls,
and the walls of our house had holes.

171
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:51,369
He had been hitting the hammer
through the walls.

172
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:55,414
My siblings put me
in my mom's bedroom and tucked me in.

173
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:59,458
I remember as a 5-year-old
pulling those blankets up to my neck,

174
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:03,068
feeling like
this is the only protection I had.

175
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,851
Next thing I knew,
a police officer walked through the door,

176
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:12,114
right when his partner
was putting my dad in the police car.

177
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:15,263
And then they drove away.

178
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:18,593
Next day, we were on the move.

179
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:20,550
I think we lived
in seven different houses,

180
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:24,074
kind of running from my dad.

181
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:36,076
My mom remarried actually
to kind of a real aggressive guy.

182
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,468
Hank was his name.
I called him "Hank the Tank."

183
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,469
He was an ex-military dude.

184
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:45,557
Used to do a white-glove test
every Saturday morning in our house.

185
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:49,428
One time, I didn't hang my jacket up,
and he came in and said,

186
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:55,082
"Hey, hang up that jacket 500 times
and yell out the number.

187
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:59,106
Follow the rules or be crushed."

188
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,040
I remember one day,
the bedroom door was slightly ajar,

189
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:08,911
and I heard my mom yell for me, "Jimmy!"

190
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:11,694
It was weak,
but I went in and I was shocked

191
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:14,957
because she looked frail. She was thinner.

192
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,740
But I didn't think anything else
other than maybe she just...

193
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:21,045
You know, she was pretty sick.

194
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:24,176
My mom was not doing well.
I didn't know what was wrong with her,

195
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,482
but Hank
would lock her inside the bedroom

196
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:30,395
and I'd go weeks without seeing my mom,

197
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:33,961
even living in the same house.
And Hank would always threaten me:

198
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:39,266
"Don't bother your mother.
You're gonna wear her down."

199
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,920
One day,
my brother was back from the Navy.

200
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,319
He was 19, I was 9.

201
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:51,314
He started calling
each one of us into the bedroom.

202
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:54,750
And I walked in
and my big brother put me on his knee,

203
00:15:54,774 --> 00:16:02,774
and he said, "I don't know
how to tell you this, but Mom's dead."

204
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:10,275
I dug my fingers
into his forearm so deeply, his arm bled.

205
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,319
We go to the funeral a few days later.

206
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:18,408
And we get home and all
of our stuff was sold, all our furniture.

207
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:22,061
There was a box
of our goods in the living room.

208
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:25,627
Hank came out
of the master bedroom with his bags packed

209
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,366
and said, "I'm leaving.
I can't take the pressure

210
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,628
of four or five kids."

211
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:35,152
And he got into a taxi and took off.

212
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:47,198
And my brother said, "I've got a friend.
Their family's gonna take us in.

213
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:50,722
We're gonna be foster kids."

214
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:55,896
We moved to this little town,
a desert town called Morongo Valley.

215
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,550
It was chaos.
I mean, that place was not healthy.

216
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:04,593
Six months
into being at this foster family,

217
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:08,594
the social worker came out,
and she said, "We've got a problem."

218
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:13,683
And I thought, finally, an adult
that understands what I'm going through.

219
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:18,989
And the foster father accuses me
of trying to murder him as a 9-year-old.

220
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:24,599
He was struggling
with some mental issues, I think.

221
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,730
I'm thinking, do adults tell the truth?

222
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:31,004
Do fathers tell the truth?

223
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,863
After being there a year,
my dad showed up.

224
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:41,299
He tracked us down.
He said, "Hey, I heard Mom died.

225
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:46,431
I've been trying to find you.
I'm sorry what's happened."

226
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:50,736
He asked the question,
"Would you like to live with me?"

227
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Yes.

228
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:57,347
But it was kind of that feeling
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, you know?

229
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,608
If you come up in an alcoholic home,

230
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:01,695
you don't know
which father you're gonna get.

231
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:05,219
The good guy or the bad guy?

232
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:09,610
But I was desperate. I'll take either one.

233
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:13,134
I moved in with my dad.
And it was rocky for that year.

234
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,135
My siblings
didn't think I should live with him.

235
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,049
And the master plan
was for me to move in with my brother.

236
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:25,311
He had just married
his 16-year-old girlfriend.

237
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:31,747
And the family wanted me to tell my father
that I couldn't live with them.

238
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:35,618
So we had a family conference
in this living room.

239
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:39,228
I remember
having to look at my father. I'm now 11.

240
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,662
And I look at him and I say:

241
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,751
"Hey, I don't think
I should live with you anymore."

242
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:48,838
And he looked at me and said, "Why not?"

243
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,013
And I remember exactly what I said to him.

244
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:59,102
I said, "You haven't been a good father
and you didn't treat Mom really well."

245
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:05,061
And to his credit, he stood up
and walked over to me and hugged me.

246
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:10,062
He said, "You know what?
I haven't been a good father.

247
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:12,410
And I wasn't a good husband.

248
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,434
But I love you."

249
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:27,457
And four months later, he was found dead
in an abandoned building, drunk.

250
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:32,481
He had fallen asleep and froze to death.

251
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,678
Those were the last words
I had for my dad.

252
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,765
"You're not a very good father."

253
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,914
And, you know, I regret that to this day.

254
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:52,942
I move in with my brother.

255
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:56,726
I go through junior high
and starting high school.

256
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,770
I like sports.

257
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:00,205
I play football, basketball, baseball.

258
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:05,337
I find structure in those things, I think.

259
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:09,990
Sophomore year, got a new football coach
at our high school, Coach Paul Morrow.

260
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:14,904
And he just commanded respect
right from the get-go.

261
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:20,123
So I remember the first two-a-days,
it's like 100 degrees.

262
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:24,821
And he pulls me out of the line
and grabs me by the facemask and says:

263
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:26,995
"If you're gonna be a quarterback

264
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:30,126
for this team,
you gotta win at these wind sprints.

265
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,909
Gotta demonstrate leadership."

266
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:36,911
And it's the first time
I'd been called out like that.

267
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,389
And I would say
that I went from a boy to a man

268
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,413
under Coach Paul Morrow.

269
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,870
He started inviting me over
to his house for dinner.

270
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:50,784
"Why don't you come to my house,
have tacos? We got Taco Tuesday."

271
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:54,611
His wife, Joyce, would make,
you know, like a thousand tacos

272
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:59,047
for us guys that would show up
and we'd scarf these things down.

273
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,960
Eventually, he asked me

274
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,656
if I'd like to go to a Fellowship
of Christian Athletes Camp.

275
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:11,006
I said, "Don't got the money for that." He
said, "No. Joyce and I will pay for that."

276
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,703
So I go to this FCA camp.

277
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:15,790
And there's a guy
from the San Diego Chargers,

278
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:17,355
and he gave a message.

279
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:20,705
And we're clowning around,
like, all we wanna do is play football.

280
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,315
At night, we're "Oh, man,
another boring Christian speaker.

281
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:26,881
I mean, really. Come on."

282
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:31,229
Anyway, this guy gets up there, and
he goes, "Has your father let you down?

283
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:35,503
Has your stepfather let you down?"

284
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,885
And it just pulled me in.

285
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,886
"I'm gonna introduce you
to somebody who'll never let you down,

286
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,625
and that's Jesus Christ."

287
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:53,496
And he just kept talking.
And I just was compelled.

288
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,279
He said, "Come down here
if you want that relationship

289
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:58,671
with a father that you've never had."

290
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:03,933
And I was there,
in tears, bawling, "I want that father."

291
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:08,108
That night, I gave my life to the Lord.

292
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:11,370
It didn't change everything overnight.

293
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:14,806
I mean, I still had many valleys.

294
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,455
But, eventually, it lined up.

295
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:22,504
And I will forever be indebted
to Coach Paul Morrow.

296
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:27,287
He was that first man that paid attention
to me, that seemed to care about me.

297
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:31,811
He was treating me like a dad would.

298
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:45,031
Every child needs a godly father.

299
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:48,380
But that may not be
your biological father.

300
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:53,294
It may be someone
who accepts that role in your life,

301
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:58,383
to bring
the Heavenly Father's perspective to you,

302
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:02,949
and to take the principles
of what he is like and mirror them,

303
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:05,254
model them before you.

304
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,602
In the same way
that Jesus became the visual image

305
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,256
of the Heavenly Father,

306
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,387
men should become
the visible image of that Father,

307
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:24,161
as modeled by Christ,
to those who still need to be fathered.

308
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:46,743
My dad ended up leaving
when I was around 3 or 4 years old.

309
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,308
My mom, you know,
was continuing to do the best she can.

310
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:53,207
Odd jobs here and there, and...

311
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,291
I might be, wow, 5 or 6.

312
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,659
My mom just told
the person she was sitting there with,

313
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:03,530
she told him, she's like,
"When we adopted Deland..."

314
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:06,052
I remember looking up
saying, "I'm adopted?"

315
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:09,444
I can't remember what her response was.
She just kind of kept on going.

316
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:14,967
She was like, "Yeah,"
and she kept doing what she was doing.

317
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:18,099
My mom started seeing another person.

318
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,231
He had spent time in jail.
We had to go up and visit him.

319
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,380
I never liked it.

320
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:30,668
It was almost like we were sacrificing
being in that type of situation,

321
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:34,017
for what I guess we thought
would be a back-end reward

322
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,887
of a guy getting out of jail,
who was gonna do the right things

323
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:41,540
and do right by my mom
and by me and my brother.

324
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:45,814
That... That is not what happened.

325
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:49,499
I think some of the anger
or the resentment that I held

326
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:52,021
towards the males that I was exposed to,

327
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:55,761
I had a major problem with those guys.

328
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,632
I was really looking past
those times and those instances

329
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:04,111
with those guys to just a better life.

330
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,894
I prayed for me and my brother and my mom

331
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:11,069
to get through this night,
or whatever it is.

332
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:15,158
I just wanted to get past this,
this period of time in my life

333
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:18,463
that I could start
doing something on my own.

334
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:21,028
Campbell Memorial
had quite a shootout tonight,

335
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:25,812
as they were battling it out
for the Mahoning Valley Conference title.

336
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:29,248
So going into my senior year,
things really took off.

337
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,423
McCullough will take it the last 11.

338
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:35,380
Touchdown here! They go up 27-22.

339
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:38,077
I said, "Well, I'm not staying here.

340
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:42,947
I'll tell you that right now.
If nothing happens, I'm not staying here."

341
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:45,122
That's when the switch flipped for me.

342
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:49,079
I said, "I might be smaller
than them guys," at that time.

343
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:51,950
"But nobody is gonna work harder than me."

344
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:54,298
I was in a position
to start getting recruited.

345
00:25:54,322 --> 00:25:57,560
Sherman Smith came to recruit me.

346
00:25:57,584 --> 00:26:01,213
In 1989, I coached at Miami of Ohio.

347
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:04,431
We had decided we were going
to recruit Deland McCullough.

348
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:07,258
McCullough, he is gonna break through
a couple tackles.

349
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:08,259
He ran hard.

350
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,912
He's a straight-line runner.

351
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,216
...into the end zone.

352
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,478
Man, he was just getting it.

353
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:17,957
You know, this guy
was just trying to get away.

354
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:20,914
So I was fortunate that I was able
to recruit in my hometown area,

355
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:23,063
Youngstown, Ohio.

356
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,916
I go to his high school, his senior year,

357
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,570
and he comes downstairs
and, you know, I introduced myself.

358
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,353
And I went down, it was like a movie.

359
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:36,266
He had his back turned, he turned around,

360
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,832
he said, "I'm Sherman Smith,
running back coach from Miami University."

361
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:47,573
And he was well spoken, and put together,
and smart, played in the NFL.

362
00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:50,400
I'm blown away
because I'd never seen a person

363
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:53,445
face to face, you know, from Youngstown

364
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:55,749
who had accomplished
what he had accomplished.

365
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:58,663
It was the same day
that I did a home visit

366
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,446
and went to his home,
and I met his mom, Adele.

367
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,665
I told Deland, "This is the type of man
that you need to be around."

368
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:09,939
Somebody like Coach Smith.

369
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:15,102
I remember I drove them to campus,

370
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:19,886
because at that time, they didn't have
the means to get there on their own.

371
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,496
Four and a half hours
in the car there and back, just to talk.

372
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,672
I loved it up there, you know.

373
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:33,150
And I just was looking
at Coach Smith as somebody...

374
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:36,934
I'm like,
"This is a guy I can learn a lot from

375
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,761
and just continue
to form a connection with,"

376
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:44,284
so I end up,
you know, committing to Miami.

377
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:52,308
After Coach Smith, the other schools
didn't make a difference at that point.

378
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:05,768
I wanted to make a difference
in Deland's life, no doubt about it.

379
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,072
We just talked.

380
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:11,465
All I knew of him
was as the running back coach for Miami.

381
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,596
Man, I wanna live to glorify God.

382
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,771
I wanna be a difference maker.

383
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:18,249
I wanna be a mentor, an example.

384
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:21,946
Then it's not something that you do,
it's who you are.

385
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,556
His character and everything
came through immediately,

386
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,600
and that's what drew me to him.

387
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:32,036
When you meet guys, you don't know
if they don't have a father in their life.

388
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,906
You don't know what they have.
Your conversation may not get that deep.

389
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,038
I liked what he stood for
and the way he carried himself.

390
00:28:41,062 --> 00:28:44,604
Like I always say to my players,
"You may not be looking for a father,

391
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:47,344
but I'm gonna treat you like my son."

392
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:51,910
I could just imagine him
being, you know, a great father.

393
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:55,824
In the way he treated us,
the way he treated the running backs.

394
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:59,565
The type of person he was, he was strong.

395
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:03,653
Going through that first semester and just
excited and feeling good about everything.

396
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:06,653
That's when Coach Smith, he ended up...

397
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:10,350
He got a job
at the University of Illinois.

398
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,249
That was tough.

399
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:17,873
He was the reason that I went to Miami.

400
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:21,440
From my life experiences,
you learn how to adapt.

401
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:24,789
I'm like, "Hey,
I've dealt with a whole lot worse,

402
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,137
with guys leaving my life."

403
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,094
You know what I'm saying?
I mean, some guys went out with a bang.

404
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:32,399
He didn't go out with...
He was solid for me

405
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:36,052
all the way up until he left,
and was respectful when he left.

406
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,444
So I was good.

407
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:40,141
I was good with the next move.

408
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:43,141
He put his name
in the record book at Miami University.

409
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,317
Matter of fact, Deland McCullough
is the all-time leading rusher

410
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,273
in the Mid-American Conference.

411
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:56,101
And yet he enters the NFL
feeling he still has a lot to prove.

412
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:59,363
I was like the sixth-string guy,
coming into training camp.

413
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:03,320
And by the end, I was the number one guy.

414
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,842
"I'm gonna be a hard-working guy.

415
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm gonna try to be the best person
I can be, flaws like everybody.

416
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:16,237
But I wanna create something more positive
for myself and for my family."

417
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:21,108
We go into the last preseason game
with two minutes left.

418
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:24,632
And I get my knee blown out.

419
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:35,025
Needless to say, a major setback.

420
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:39,243
And, you know,
the interview after my knee injury,

421
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,113
and have the media and everybody say,

422
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:44,549
"Hey, you were supposed to be the starter
the following week."

423
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:47,636
I felt like right then,
everything was validated.

424
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:55,660
You know, if I never played another play,
I showed I could play on this level.

425
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:05,206
I had two ACL surgeries on my right knee.

426
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:10,860
I was done at that point.
I said, "I gotta start working.

427
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:13,078
Would love to do something in coaching."

428
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:16,252
And then here I am,
you know, now at Miami,

429
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:21,776
I'm a 37-year-old intern,
basically, at my alma mater,

430
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,081
which is weird, like, "Okay, I'm looking
at my picture all over the place,

431
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:28,256
but I'm the lowest level guy
on the staff."

432
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,530
But it's all good.

433
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,779
I'm there, I'm loving it,

434
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:36,780
and I get a call
from the head coach at Indiana.

435
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:40,825
He offered me a job
as a running back coach.

436
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:46,044
Put a bunch of guys in the NFL,
and, you know, kind of rose up the ranks.

437
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:50,827
So I'm like, "Wow. You know,
I just got in this and just took off."

438
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:53,436
As he was coaching at Indiana University,

439
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,916
he would call me up, we'd talk
about coaching techniques and questions.

440
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,786
I wasn't saying,
"I'm gonna do what Coach Smith did."

441
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,091
It just happened.

442
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:04,961
"I'm gonna call Deland up tonight,
give me some drills for this.

443
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:06,788
Give me this. Give me that."

444
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:10,919
So we had that kind of relationship,
a coach-friend relationship.

445
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:13,572
And we're both from Youngstown.
We both went to Miami.

446
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:17,312
The time we spent together,
our relationship, talking on the phone.

447
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,791
Both of us going to play pro ball,

448
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:22,487
both of our careers end
because of knee surgeries.

449
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:27,185
I tell all my players this,
that they made a difference in my life.

450
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:28,968
I got something from them.

451
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:32,882
Our next job both was in the Big 10.
He went to Illinois, I went to Indiana.

452
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,795
This is why I do what I do.

453
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,819
This is why I do it, for guys like that.

454
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:45,015
Fatherhood on earth actually
comes from the fatherhood of God.

455
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,625
God didn't look down
on something He created,

456
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:51,235
and says, "Hey, I like that.
I'm gonna call myself Father."

457
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:55,278
No. From the very beginning,
He, as the perfect father,

458
00:32:55,302 --> 00:33:01,715
created fatherhood on earth
as an introduction to who He is.

459
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:04,237
So a father should view himself

460
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:08,543
as a provider of not just physical things
for his family

461
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:14,762
but spiritual example
and nourishment for his children.

462
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:19,416
A father has to also be
a strong protector for his family.

463
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,329
We see families falling apart
when fathers don't step in

464
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:28,810
and protect their wives, protect
their children, protect their families.

465
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:32,811
Another role a father has
is to be a loving leader.

466
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:38,029
Not passive on the sidelines, but
stepping up and leading by his example.

467
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:42,856
Coaching his kids with clear direction
and leading them with love,

468
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,466
winning the hearts of his children.

469
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,337
A father has to also be
a truthful teacher to his children.

470
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,294
If there's something
you want them to learn,

471
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:56,469
you take responsibility
for teaching it to them.

472
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,687
A father should be
a willing helper to his children.

473
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:03,254
A father should voluntarily
look for ways to serve his kids.

474
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,733
Getting his hands dirty, helping
to meet their practical day-to-day needs.

475
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:12,995
A father
is also to be a hopeful encourager.

476
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,779
Cheering his kids on towards success,

477
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,171
walking them through the hard times,

478
00:34:18,195 --> 00:34:20,431
and giving them hope for the future.

479
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:23,389
As kids get older, a father will shift.

480
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:26,825
He will take on the role
of being a compassionate friend.

481
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:30,478
Even as a father
shows compassion on his children,

482
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:34,348
so God also shows compassion on us.

483
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,871
We should view fatherhood
as an introduction

484
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:42,177
to the fatherhood of God,
and dads should ask God to help them

485
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:50,201
to be a good representation
of who He is to their own children.

486
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:57,267
A big day in New York City
for Ohio State tailback Eddie George.

487
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:00,138
It is my pleasure to announce the winner.

488
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:03,287
Eddie George, Ohio State!

489
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:12,967
To have my father proud,
to have him in the stands cheering.

490
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:15,489
Feeling good about his life.

491
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:22,513
That was my sole purpose
of playing a game of football.

492
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:28,319
I must have been about 9 or 10 years old,

493
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:31,103
my mother told me
he had a nervous breakdown,

494
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:36,234
and he just resorted
to ease the pain through substance abuse,

495
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:40,258
and he was a garbage-can junkie.

496
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,975
The year that he connected with me
was the year I won the Heisman.

497
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:47,672
And people around me were like:

498
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:52,717
"He's only coming back because he sees
the potential in you going to the NFL

499
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:54,457
and he wants something from you."

500
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:56,231
I didn't care.

501
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,414
I didn't care.

502
00:35:58,438 --> 00:36:05,438
I wanted my father.
I always was looking for my father.

503
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:15,962
The Houston Oilers select Eddie George,
running back from Ohio State.

504
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:19,420
1996, I was drafted
by the Houston Oilers, where I...

505
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:25,247
That's where I first met Coach Sherman,
who was my running back coach.

506
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:27,378
Eddie took charge from day one.

507
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:34,902
There was no question
in anyone's mind that he was special.

508
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:40,164
Out the gate,
Coach Sherman called me Big Cat.

509
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:44,557
He said, "Big Cat,
glad to have you, glad we drafted you."

510
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:46,818
And I just got
a good feeling about Sherman

511
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:50,471
because he was young, approachable.

512
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:58,120
And he was just someone
that I felt like I could grow under.

513
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:03,258
Sherman felt more like a father
than he did a coach.

514
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:08,954
I get a phone call from my girlfriend
at the time that she was pregnant.

515
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:13,738
And I'm not ready
to be a father at 22 years old.

516
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:19,262
And I panicked.
And Sherman pulls me aside.

517
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:22,480
And he says, "Man, listen, calm down.

518
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:25,698
It is a beautiful thing to have a child.

519
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:31,351
When all the emotions settle down,
you wanna do what's best for your son."

520
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:36,658
He says, "Man up,
take on your responsibility.

521
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:39,354
Be a father to your son.

522
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:44,876
Be in his life, not just be a paycheck,
but really be there for your son."

523
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,530
And he helped me
get through that emotionally.

524
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:54,532
At that particular moment,
Sherman Smith was the perfect fit for me.

525
00:37:54,556 --> 00:38:02,306
He was the father figure
that I needed at that point in time.

526
00:38:02,383 --> 00:38:07,274
Sherman was always that second father
figure for me when I was playing sports.

527
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:12,188
He treated his guys like that.
Sherm was big on responsibility now.

528
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:15,407
I mean, because as a player,
you had to be responsible for your job,

529
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:17,060
or you'd mess up the whole team.

530
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:20,538
And so he's letting us know
that being responsible as a fullback,

531
00:38:20,562 --> 00:38:23,843
being responsible as a running back,
being responsible with the ball

532
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:27,062
that you're given to carry,
not dropping it.

533
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:30,019
And he would carry that into life,
"Don't drop the ball now,

534
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:32,716
because it's not
somebody else's responsibility

535
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,717
to carry what you've been given."

536
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:39,674
So we talked about
being the type of person you wanna be.

537
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:42,719
Man, if you're a dependable,
accountable, responsible person,

538
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:44,936
that goes with you on the football field.

539
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,719
You don't leave
who you are in the locker room.

540
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:50,676
You take that with you,
that's who you are.

541
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,285
You can't compartmentalize,

542
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:55,244
"Well, I'm a dependable,
accountable, responsible football player

543
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:59,592
but I'm an irresponsible father,
husband, man."

544
00:38:59,616 --> 00:39:01,897
It doesn't go together. It doesn't work.

545
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:04,942
So what he was doing
was feeding our spirit

546
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:09,334
about what it means to be a godly man.

547
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:11,900
Being a father is very important.

548
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:15,161
It's not just talk,
there's gotta be an action.

549
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:20,435
It has to be authentic, it has to be real.

550
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:33,428
One of the principles in Scripture
is the principle of adoption.

551
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:41,255
That we have been adopted into a family
where God is our father.

552
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:45,604
God doesn't just wanna be
a distant acquaintance to us.

553
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:48,648
He doesn't just wanna be
a mentor or a provider.

554
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,693
He wants to be a loving father to us.

555
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:54,868
When we place our faith in Jesus,
the Scripture says:

556
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,173
"The Father adopts us into his family."

557
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:00,870
We become His beloved children.

558
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:05,261
We now have access
to His ear and His heart and His throne.

559
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:11,176
So there is a relational component
to our salvation that's not theoretical,

560
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,950
but is very practical.

561
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:30,964
One day, my wife and I were on an airplane
flying to New York City.

562
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:35,052
I'm sitting on the airplane, I'm spending
some time reading the Scriptures.

563
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:38,313
And I was reading in John, chapter 10.

564
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:40,793
"I have other sheep
that are not of this fold

565
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:43,185
that I must bring
to be a part of this fold."

566
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:48,447
I'm looking at this passage of Scripture
and God speaks to my heart, crystal clear.

567
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:51,274
It wasn't audible,
but he communicates to me,

568
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:53,883
"I want you to be open to adoption."

569
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:56,319
This was totally unexpected.

570
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:59,146
And I turned to my wife, and I said:

571
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,624
"I think God wants us
to be open to adoption."

572
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:06,799
Well, she smiles,
and I didn't realize that she had been

573
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:11,279
praying for me for two years that God
would turn my heart towards adoption.

574
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,237
I felt like
the Lord was confirming something

575
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:17,194
that he'd been stirring
in my heart for years.

576
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:20,021
A friend of mine
was in the process of adopting,

577
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:25,805
and she was sharing
about the kids in orphanages in China

578
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:31,829
that didn't have a mom and dad,
and I was sold.

579
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,461
So I wrote down in my Bible "adoption"
next to that verse, and I dated it.

580
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:44,374
Fast forward two years.

581
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:50,855
We filled out all the paperwork,
and then they begin to send us referrals.

582
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:54,421
We get this picture
on my phone of this cute little girl

583
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,464
in another country,
she had a cleft palate.

584
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:58,205
And she was precious.

585
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,944
They said,
"Do you wanna adopt this child?"

586
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:04,032
We were thinking,
"We got 24 hours to make a decision."

587
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:08,685
And unexpectedly,
this strong heaviness comes over me.

588
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:12,948
It was weird. It was almost like
this dark cloud comes over my heart,

589
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:14,731
like something is not right.

590
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:16,383
Didn't make sense to me.

591
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:18,557
It's making me sleepless at night.

592
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:20,558
I'm praying, talking to Jill.

593
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:25,473
And I remember calling a friend
and she advises people on adoptions.

594
00:42:25,497 --> 00:42:30,735
She said, "This is too big of a decision.
If it is not a clear yes, then it's a no."

595
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:38,009
So when Stephen
turned down that first referral, I cried.

596
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,695
A few days later,
they send us another referral.

597
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,043
Same thing happens,

598
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:51,306
precious girl, beautiful, heaviness,
something's not right, I turn it down.

599
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:57,350
It happens again about a few weeks later.
They send us another referral, heaviness.

600
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:01,134
And I eventually turned down
four referrals.

601
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:03,439
I called the adoption agency, said:

602
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:06,265
"How does this work?
Because this is not fun anymore."

603
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:09,658
And I begin to be worried about
what are people gonna think about me?

604
00:43:09,682 --> 00:43:11,572
I know there's no child that's perfect.

605
00:43:11,596 --> 00:43:13,267
What's wrong with me?

606
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:16,877
I'm struggling here. This is hard.

607
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:19,791
The next month, the adoption agency
quit sending referrals.

608
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:21,749
To be honest, I was relieved.

609
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:24,227
I was like,
"This is harder than I thought."

610
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:29,055
We're on this emotional roller coaster now
every time they send a referral.

611
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,273
And then a fifth referral
pops in my e-mail inbox.

612
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:37,796
And I was like,
"Oh, no, here we go again."

613
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,405
And this little girl pops up.

614
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:45,972
And she has a worse medical condition
than some of the others.

615
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:49,147
She was born
with a severe heart condition.

616
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:51,539
Her mother
had wrapped her in a red blanket

617
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:53,887
and had left her outside of a building

618
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:59,062
with the hope that somebody would find her
and help her have her heart surgery.

619
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,758
Jill and I looked at her,

620
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:05,108
and for some reason,
this peace comes over both of us.

621
00:44:05,132 --> 00:44:08,848
And I was like,
"Why am I okay with helping this girl

622
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:11,414
with her major medical heart condition,

623
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:16,110
and I was struggling
with the girl that had a cleft palate?"

624
00:44:16,134 --> 00:44:19,328
And I looked at Jill,
and she said, "I like her."

625
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,546
And I was like, "I do too.

626
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,677
Something is right
about this little girl."

627
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,809
I went over to a friend's house

628
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:28,244
and showed her Mia's picture
and was talking about her.

629
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:33,941
And she said,
"I can tell that you already love her."

630
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:35,215
And I did.

631
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:45,031
We looked on the adoption papers, and
it says that she was born on 2/14/2011.

632
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:47,205
And I remember saying to Stephen:

633
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:51,642
"She was born
on Valentine's Day with a broken heart."

634
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:54,034
And so we contact the adoption agency,

635
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,556
we said,
"We're gonna adopt this little girl."

636
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,731
Jill said, "Hey, when did God
speak to your heart about adoption?"

637
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:04,123
So I went back to my Bible,
and I opened it up.

638
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:06,993
And right next to John 10:16
was the word "adoption."

639
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:10,516
And then it was dated 2/14/2011.

640
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,300
The same day that she was born in China

641
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:17,561
was the same day God was speaking to me
on that airplane saying:

642
00:45:17,585 --> 00:45:21,585
"I want you to adopt this girl."

643
00:45:23,543 --> 00:45:27,476
I just remember
being so overwhelmed by God,

644
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,250
because it was too precise
to be an accident.

645
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:38,915
It was like the hair
on the back of my neck was standing up

646
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:42,002
because there was
this awesome sense of God saying:

647
00:45:42,026 --> 00:45:45,917
"I was in you turning down
those first four referrals.

648
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:48,309
I am in this situation,

649
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,439
and I'm gonna teach you
something about Me,

650
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:56,838
and I'm gonna be glorified
through this adoption."

651
00:46:01,684 --> 00:46:03,934
Oh, nice slippers.

652
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,255
We're gonna go get Mia.

653
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,402
We're in the Forbidden City.

654
00:46:10,426 --> 00:46:17,708
It's not really that forbidden.
I mean, there's people everywhere.

655
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:20,317
We go to the orphanage.

656
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:22,360
When we rounded the corner,

657
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:26,101
she was the first child,
standing there waiting on us.

658
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:29,102
I remember walking in the room in China

659
00:46:29,126 --> 00:46:31,015
and seeing Mia for the first time

660
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,755
and she was scared
and didn't know who we were.

661
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:36,234
We saw Mia's bed.

662
00:46:36,258 --> 00:46:39,800
We saw her condition.
She didn't have anything that she owned.

663
00:46:39,824 --> 00:46:41,410
God was allowing us

664
00:46:41,434 --> 00:46:45,062
to really rescue her
from a difficult future.

665
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:47,368
We just finished
filling out all the paperwork,

666
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:50,151
giving our thumbprints,
and now she's ours.

667
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:52,675
And now she is ours.

668
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:59,414
While we were in China with Mia,
she was... She started calling me Mama.

669
00:46:59,438 --> 00:47:03,633
-And she kept calling Stephen something.
-Yeah.

670
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:10,282
And we found out later,
she was calling him Grandpa.

671
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,461
It's okay.

672
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:14,201
Probably one
of the most difficult airplane flights

673
00:47:14,225 --> 00:47:17,723
I've ever been on in my life
was that 14-hour journey

674
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:20,768
to fly from China
all the way to New York City

675
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:24,073
with an orphan who's 2,
and doesn't know who you are,

676
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:25,464
or why she's on an airplane.

677
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:33,488
She was upset, and she was surrounded
by new things constantly.

678
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,163
She doesn't know who she is.

679
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,946
She doesn't know
she's Mia Elizabeth Kendrick.

680
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:44,687
She doesn't know that we are taking her
to a very loving, safe home.

681
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:47,471
She doesn't know that I'm her daddy now.

682
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:53,733
So many kids that are in orphanages
have never experienced a mom and a dad

683
00:47:53,757 --> 00:48:01,757
that are attentive to their needs,
and it can be an adjustment.

684
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:10,215
Sometimes she would wake up
in the middle of the night crying,

685
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,172
just terrified.

686
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:13,912
Sometimes she would hold on to food

687
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:20,697
like she didn't have any other provision
after that meal or something.

688
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:25,046
We saw her whole personality
transform over the next few weeks,

689
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,945
to go from fear to joy.

690
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:32,352
We have watched Mia bloom in our home.

691
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,438
Say "Hi, Mia."

692
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,462
Hi, Mia.

693
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:42,572
Didn't have anything to do with her,
even though she was super cute.

694
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:48,747
We just chose to love her
and make her a part of our family.

695
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:51,356
And I know that God does that for us too.

696
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,505
He's set His heart on us.

697
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:02,707
God has given me such a love for her
that is equal to my other children.

698
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,448
I don't want anything bad
to happen to her.

699
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:09,666
I wanna protect her,
provide for her, take care of her.

700
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,972
She is our sunshine.
I call her "Sunshine."

701
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:18,321
She smiles very easily and is a joy.

702
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:20,756
She doesn't meet a stranger.

703
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,757
My name is Mia Kendrick,
and I was born in China.

704
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:33,237
Mia is our loudest, most extrovert child,
of all of our six children now.

705
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:37,021
We had another biological daughter
after we adopted Mia.

706
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:39,064
They are two peas in a pod,
playing together,

707
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:41,631
laughing together every day.

708
00:49:41,655 --> 00:49:46,415
When I come home from work now,
Mia is the first one to run to the door,

709
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:47,893
and want to be hugged.

710
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:53,792
Everything is just twice
as exciting with her.

711
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:02,245
So while she was in China,
she had an initial life-saving surgery.

712
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:05,855
But we knew that she was gonna need
another major surgery

713
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:09,073
when she got back to the States,
or she would not survive long-term.

714
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:15,472
The right side of her heart
doesn't work properly.

715
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:21,620
Her mother
likely gave her up to save her life.

716
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:26,904
In the spring of 2019,
Mia had another major heart surgery

717
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:30,122
that really saved her life for the future.

718
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:33,514
I really had a peace
going into the surgery.

719
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:36,210
I thought she's gonna do great.

720
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:37,984
Stephen cried.

721
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,081
The doctors pushed her back.

722
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:43,038
And I stood there in the hospital lobby

723
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:51,062
and just wept, thinking, "God, I want you
to take care of my little girl."

724
00:50:51,412 --> 00:50:53,433
And she came out with flying colors.

725
00:50:53,457 --> 00:50:55,825
Everything went so well.

726
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:58,825
She has half a heart
that is functioning now,

727
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:02,565
but she is positioned
to have long-term health

728
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:07,088
because of the surgeries that she's had.

729
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:11,219
We saw her go
from huffing and puffing over a short walk

730
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:15,960
to being able to beat me in a bike race
on the road after the surgeries.

731
00:51:15,984 --> 00:51:18,984
It really is incredible.

732
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:35,834
Through this journey with Mia,

733
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:39,749
my eyes began to open
to our spiritual adoption.

734
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:42,968
Scripture communicates
that God doesn't just forgive us.

735
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:45,576
He didn't just send Jesus
to pay for our sins,

736
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,794
but He wants to adopt us into His family.

737
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,143
And this whole parallel of adoption

738
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:56,058
began to deepen
my understanding of God as our Father.

739
00:51:56,082 --> 00:52:00,668
God has put a hole in our hearts
that's in the shape of a father.

740
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:05,817
And we are longing for that to be filled.

741
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:11,061
There are so many people,
I believe, in churches who believe in God,

742
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:13,845
but they don't know who they are.

743
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:18,411
They don't know
who their Heavenly Father is.

744
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:23,108
They don't know
that God's plans for them are good.

745
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:27,132
They are the functional orphans.

746
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:33,024
God has a heart
for the orphans. He cares about them.

747
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:35,851
He has compassion on them.

748
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:40,591
And that's what He thinks
about you. He cares about you.

749
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,990
He's a good father.

750
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,636
He will take care of you.

751
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,550
He loved you through His Son.

752
00:52:49,574 --> 00:52:52,855
He sent Jesus to come to die for you,

753
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:56,986
the greatest sacrifice
to meet your greatest need.

754
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:04,423
God didn't just create fatherhood,
God is a father, and He loves you.

755
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:09,251
This is one of the greatest expressions
of God's love.

756
00:53:09,275 --> 00:53:10,400
Adoption.

757
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:26,516
Jesus said He wants us to have

758
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:32,665
the same relationship
to His father that He has.

759
00:53:32,716 --> 00:53:37,693
So now we've been invited
as brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ

760
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:40,824
into a whole new family experience.

761
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:45,087
So the characteristics of love
and patience and kindness and goodness

762
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:49,870
and faithfulness, all these things that
originated with God are in Jesus Christ.

763
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:54,915
And because Jesus is that link
between a sinful man, of which we all are,

764
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:58,263
and a Holy God,
He is that bridge, He is that link.

765
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:00,134
Then when I get to know Jesus,

766
00:54:00,158 --> 00:54:02,221
that's my pathway
to get to know the Father.

767
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:08,396
Anyone, anywhere,
at any place, can turn to Christ

768
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,615
and experience the love of the Father
by placing their faith in Jesus.

769
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:15,442
When the light bulb goes on,

770
00:54:15,466 --> 00:54:19,835
and they repent of their sins
and place their faith in Christ,

771
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,183
everything changes for them.

772
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:29,229
He says, "Your identity now is that
you are unconditionally loved by Me.

773
00:54:29,253 --> 00:54:36,253
That's who you are,
and nothing will ever change that."

774
00:54:41,038 --> 00:54:45,362
When it comes to us
ministering in difficult circumstances,

775
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:47,798
making movies
that we had never been trained to do...

776
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:48,886
And action.

777
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,930
...the thought never crossed our minds,
"This is too hard, can't be done."

778
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:56,757
We'd watched our dad
do things that were extremely hard,

779
00:54:56,781 --> 00:55:04,107
that shouldn't have been able
to be done, and him still do it.

780
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:11,881
When I was 42 years old,
I started losing my ability to walk.

781
00:55:12,828 --> 00:55:15,632
So, ultimately, I went into the hospital,

782
00:55:15,656 --> 00:55:23,656
and they did more tests and came back
and said that you have multiple sclerosis.

783
00:55:27,963 --> 00:55:34,158
He sent me out with what I saw
was no hope, no cure, nothing to do.

784
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:41,682
Just cut your legs out from under you
and leave you to bleed to death.

785
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:46,945
I had the sons at home, and the
mortgage payment and the car payment.

786
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,467
And very little, if any,
in our savings account.

787
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:56,491
So I spent 16 months
in the pits of depression.

788
00:56:01,754 --> 00:56:05,384
-Alex, this Sunday is Father's Day.
-This Sunday is Father's Day, yeah.

789
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:08,906
And so I can't think
of anyone better right now to talk about

790
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,298
than our dad, Larry Kendrick.

791
00:56:10,322 --> 00:56:14,517
And how he influenced
every movie we've ever done.

792
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:18,300
It's amazing to see how much our father
has affected our lives.

793
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:26,324
We put a representation of our father,
Larry Kendrick, in all of our movies.

794
00:56:28,414 --> 00:56:32,391
There's no way that we could have told
the stories we've told

795
00:56:32,415 --> 00:56:35,000
in the manner we did
without our father's influence.

796
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:39,741
I don't feel like I started well.
I wanna finish well.

797
00:56:39,765 --> 00:56:44,742
To whatever degree we have been able
to influence people or inspire people

798
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:45,916
or minister to them...

799
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:49,565
That's my dad! That's my dad!

800
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:54,262
...we share that credit with our dad.

801
00:56:59,465 --> 00:57:02,007
You usually need
to feel some sense of love

802
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:04,574
from your earthly father
before you begin to understand

803
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:07,705
and believe
that your Heavenly Father loves you.

804
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:11,357
Our grandfather
had been so wounded by his own father

805
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:16,838
that when he grew up, he struggled
with verbalizing love to his own children.

806
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:19,577
When I think about my dad,

807
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:23,405
a lot of times,
I was really embarrassed by him.

808
00:57:23,429 --> 00:57:25,883
My dad was 7 feet tall.

809
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:32,059
Nobody gave him any real trouble
because he was just too big.

810
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:37,321
With Daddy drinking
and losing jobs and in and out,

811
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:41,323
when he would get home,
he would be intoxicated.

812
00:57:41,347 --> 00:57:46,410
And so, my earliest years,
I didn't have a father

813
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:52,021
in the sense
that he was loving, nurturing, dependable.

814
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:56,240
I guess I would say he was insecure.

815
00:57:56,264 --> 00:58:00,283
He had made mistakes.
He'd gotten on the wrong track.

816
00:58:00,307 --> 00:58:06,329
In his later life, he knew the Lord
and was walking with the Lord.

817
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:11,417
But in his earlier life, my grandfather
was a very different person.

818
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:16,418
I never felt
I had any real guidance from him

819
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:21,333
in the sense
of how to find my way through life.

820
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:24,464
Even as we were growing up,

821
00:58:24,488 --> 00:58:26,943
Dad was dealing with all kinds of issues,

822
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:31,335
but he was shielding us
from his own internal struggles

823
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,683
and battles and fears
that he was dealing with.

824
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:37,554
We didn't realize the war
that was going on inside of him.

825
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:41,947
The Enemy started using
this prognosis of multiple sclerosis

826
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:47,470
along with his own identity issues
to just spiral that into depression.

827
00:58:47,494 --> 00:58:49,994
And I said, "Lord...

828
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:56,908
I have been wishing that You
had just taken me out of this world."

829
00:58:56,932 --> 00:59:02,057
I had been wishing that I could just die.

830
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,779
He had it out with God.

831
00:59:03,803 --> 00:59:08,476
He went into my brother's bedroom
and told God, "I'm not doing this.

832
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,781
Either You're gonna heal me,
or You're gonna take me home.

833
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:15,303
But I'm not gonna live in misery here
and drag my family down with me."

834
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:20,479
He basically threw himself
at the feet of Jesus.

835
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:24,436
"Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

836
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:30,134
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven."

837
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:33,918
Why would God ask you to pray that prayer

838
00:59:33,942 --> 00:59:39,744
if He didn't want you to believe
this could be true on earth?

839
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,268
And I said, "Lord...

840
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:45,616
for all this time
that I've been so fearful,

841
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,765
not trusting You,

842
00:59:47,945 --> 00:59:51,695
I'm asking You to forgive me."

843
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:56,288
It's like the light came through.

844
00:59:56,382 --> 00:59:58,007
And I wept...

845
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:03,794
till I couldn't weep anymore.

846
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:07,360
The Lord flipped the light back on
and he realized

847
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,622
that God is a loving father,
and He does love me.

848
01:00:10,646 --> 01:00:16,233
And that revelation
of the heart of his Heavenly Father

849
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:22,132
was really what brought dad
out of depression.

850
01:00:32,827 --> 01:00:35,237
You know, in the Sermon on the Mount,

851
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:38,282
Jesus uses the word "father"
over and over.

852
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:40,152
"Our Father who art in heaven."

853
01:00:40,176 --> 01:00:43,761
He says, "The Father
gives good gifts to the children."

854
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:49,459
He says, "If you forgive others,
your Father will forgive you."

855
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:54,764
He says, "But your Heavenly Father
knows what you have need of."

856
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:58,548
All of this is in the Sermon on the Mount.
"Father, father, father."

857
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:03,853
What we do is we transfer that
to say, "God, God, God."

858
01:01:03,877 --> 01:01:09,160
And so we go back to Elohim,
this Creator that's way out there,

859
01:01:09,184 --> 01:01:13,309
not Father, who is close in here.

860
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:18,466
I think it's so important for people,
after they've given their life to Jesus,

861
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,641
to begin to go on a journey and say,

862
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:24,468
"Father, would You reveal yourself,
Your heart, to me?

863
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:26,338
Would You show me who I am?

864
01:01:26,362 --> 01:01:28,338
Would You show Your love for me

865
01:01:28,362 --> 01:01:31,862
so that I function
in this relationship with You?"

866
01:01:31,886 --> 01:01:33,949
Just because Jesus is your Lord

867
01:01:33,973 --> 01:01:36,906
doesn't mean you're relating well
to God as your Father.

868
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:39,950
If you're not believing
He's gonna answer your prayers,

869
01:01:39,974 --> 01:01:41,603
if you don't believe He loves you,

870
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:44,908
if you don't believe
that His heart is for you,

871
01:01:44,932 --> 01:01:47,822
then you need to start
seeking God as Father,

872
01:01:47,846 --> 01:01:49,562
relating to Him as Father,

873
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:51,301
reading what His Word says

874
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:54,650
about His perfect role
as your Father in Heaven

875
01:01:54,674 --> 01:01:57,955
and ask God
to reveal to your heart who He is,

876
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:02,229
and how He wants to relate to you.

877
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:07,436
Nice. Set, go. Feet, feet, feet.

878
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,393
Step on it.

879
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:11,785
Set, go. Feet, feet, feet. Get going!

880
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:16,569
There's a definite parallel
with coaching and fathering.

881
01:02:16,593 --> 01:02:19,221
The beauty of it, for me, is with my sons,

882
01:02:19,245 --> 01:02:22,266
I get to do it on a more consistent basis

883
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,832
and be able to reinforce
that coaching and that fathering.

884
01:02:25,856 --> 01:02:29,789
Their circumstances are gonna be
way better than what mine was,

885
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:32,095
as far as me in their life.

886
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:38,619
I want these guys
to have everything I didn't have.

887
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:45,272
I would get asked about family history,
and I'm like, "Man..."

888
01:02:45,296 --> 01:02:50,099
I didn't have any answers
because I didn't know.

889
01:02:50,123 --> 01:02:54,623
My adoptive mom,
she would say to me, every few years,

890
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:59,363
"If you're ever interested in finding out
who your biological family is,

891
01:02:59,387 --> 01:03:01,494
I don't have a problem with that."

892
01:03:01,518 --> 01:03:04,668
I told him all the facts I had.

893
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:08,496
We knew he was born in Pennsylvania.

894
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,148
They said the mother was 16 years old,

895
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:15,802
that her parents
wanted her to finish school.

896
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:20,759
Just hearing that, after 30-some years,
that was strong for me at that time.

897
01:03:20,783 --> 01:03:24,195
I said, "I wanna find out."
Now, it's like a mystery.

898
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:27,109
Like "Wow, you done
gave me a couple crumbs,

899
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:32,758
I wanna go
and see what's up with this now."

900
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:35,590
I got all the paperwork.

901
01:03:35,614 --> 01:03:37,547
It was called your original birth record.

902
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:40,504
It was almost like
an original birth certificate.

903
01:03:40,528 --> 01:03:42,548
So I opened up this one sheet of paper.

904
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:48,332
And there it was. It said, you know,
"Birth name, Jon Kenneth Briggs."

905
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:54,333
It had my mom's name on there,
Carol Denise Briggs, and she was 16.

906
01:03:54,357 --> 01:03:57,857
It didn't have a dad's name.

907
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:07,859
So I ended up finding
a person named Carol Denise Briggs.

908
01:04:07,883 --> 01:04:14,557
And I'm looking on her
Facebook page, so I sent her a message.

909
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:19,383
I get home from work
at about 5:00, unmute my phone.

910
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:27,407
First thing I see, "Did you have
a baby in 1972 in Allegheny County?"

911
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:31,517
I'm stunned. Obviously, I'm stunned.

912
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:34,291
She sends back, "Yes."

913
01:04:34,498 --> 01:04:38,910
I'm like, "Okay, I'm in. I gotta
see where this is gonna go. I'm in."

914
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:42,559
"What did you name the baby?"

915
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:46,434
And she sent back, "Not Deland."

916
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,174
I kind of laughed.

917
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:51,000
I said, "I understand.
What did you name the baby?"

918
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:54,436
She said, "Jon."
I was like, "Oh, man, this is her."

919
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,133
While I'm waiting for him to call,

920
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:59,699
I am all over the Internet
looking this guy up.

921
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:04,831
It's just page after page after
page of stuff about Deland McCullough.

922
01:05:04,855 --> 01:05:07,918
And I'm like,
"Okay, this might be a real guy.

923
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:11,571
This isn't a fake.
He's real. He's really out there.

924
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:14,470
And this is really him.

925
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,225
This is really him."

926
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:17,249
So...

927
01:05:18,684 --> 01:05:22,684
So by the time he calls me back,

928
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:26,706
okay, I'm... I'm kind of a mess by then.

929
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,010
It's a great conversation.

930
01:05:28,034 --> 01:05:30,358
It's like, we've known each other forever.

931
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:34,632
And he says, "I'm Jon, obviously."

932
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:37,230
And she says she's in Youngstown.

933
01:05:37,254 --> 01:05:40,187
And I said,
"Well, that's where I grew up.

934
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:41,927
How did you end up in Pennsylvania?"

935
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:44,754
She explained to me
how things were different.

936
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:51,451
You know, and her parents
had sent her there to have me.

937
01:05:51,475 --> 01:05:55,366
My mom found out I was pregnant
like on a Tuesday or Wednesday.

938
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:58,279
And that Saturday,
I was on my way to Pittsburgh.

939
01:05:58,303 --> 01:06:00,280
It's a big deal to have a baby.

940
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:04,107
And I knew that
I wasn't prepared to be anybody's mom.

941
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:08,673
And I didn't have
any negative feelings about my decision

942
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:09,935
to place him for adoption

943
01:06:09,959 --> 01:06:15,284
because I knew
that I was doing the right thing for him.

944
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:18,545
I thought about Jon all the time.

945
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:22,546
Every December the 1st,
from the day I joined Facebook,

946
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:25,721
I put a message out,
"Happy Birthday, Jon Kenneth,

947
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:27,374
wherever you are."

948
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:31,244
When he started sending me
all these pictures of his children,

949
01:06:31,268 --> 01:06:34,201
you know, he's got
these four beautiful boys

950
01:06:34,225 --> 01:06:37,899
and my daughter-in-law
is just drop-dead gorgeous.

951
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:44,161
I'm like, "Man, how lucky
can I be to have this happen to me?"

952
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:46,466
You know, he's just fabulous.

953
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:47,988
And he's so handsome.

954
01:06:48,012 --> 01:06:56,012
And I'm thinking, "Well, this is just
more than I could have even imagined."

955
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,600
So when he heard
I was from Youngstown, he says,

956
01:07:00,624 --> 01:07:04,514
"Oh, well, do I have
any brothers and sisters?"

957
01:07:04,538 --> 01:07:08,515
And she said, "I never got married,
never had any more kids."

958
01:07:08,539 --> 01:07:12,914
Then he says, "Well, who's my dad?"

959
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:19,040
I tell him his father's name
and I can kind of hear him catch...

960
01:07:19,064 --> 01:07:22,689
I hear a catch in his throat.

961
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:28,520
Because I had a super emotional
moment at that point, you know.

962
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,086
And she was like, "What?"
She's like, "What's wrong?"

963
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,235
I said, "Oh, I know him."

964
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:46,716
He says, "Well, I've known
Sherman Smith my whole life."

965
01:07:50,594 --> 01:07:53,745
He's been my mentor,
I've been in contact with Coach Smith

966
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:57,769
for the last 20-something years.

967
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:00,528
I said, "Well, did he know?"

968
01:08:00,552 --> 01:08:02,311
She said, "Well, he knew nothing."

969
01:08:02,335 --> 01:08:05,008
She said, "He was off
at Miami when you were born.

970
01:08:05,032 --> 01:08:06,922
It's one of those things that happened."

971
01:08:06,946 --> 01:08:11,662
She said, "But I never told him.
He never even knew I was pregnant."

972
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:14,924
So, my wife had knew
that I talked to my mom.

973
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:17,837
I said, "I found out who my dad is."

974
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:19,861
She said, "Who?"

975
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:23,665
I said, "Sherman Smith." My wife lost it.

976
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:26,064
I was like, "What?"

977
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:28,971
I mean, I was so loud.

978
01:08:28,995 --> 01:08:32,624
How in the world could you
have been around your father

979
01:08:32,648 --> 01:08:37,648
for this many years, and not have known?

980
01:08:38,345 --> 01:08:40,670
The next day, he texts me at work.

981
01:08:40,694 --> 01:08:43,627
He says, "Can I tell my dad?"

982
01:08:43,651 --> 01:08:48,776
And I'm like, "Absolutely, you tell him."

983
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:55,500
So I get on the phone.
"Hey, Deland. What's going on?"

984
01:08:55,524 --> 01:09:00,805
I said, "Yeah, not too much."
So, we just started talking.

985
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:03,806
You know, he's talking about,
"Well, hey, you know I'm adopted."

986
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,198
"Yeah, man, I know."

987
01:09:05,222 --> 01:09:08,939
And he said, "You know, I started the
process to find my biological parents."

988
01:09:08,963 --> 01:09:12,417
I said, "Man, that's great to hear."
"I got my original birth certificate."

989
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:15,288
"Man, that is great. I'm excited for you."

990
01:09:15,312 --> 01:09:18,593
He said, "And I found my biological mom."

991
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:19,811
"Man, God is good."

992
01:09:19,835 --> 01:09:22,507
He's running down Bible verses.
He hitting me...

993
01:09:22,531 --> 01:09:25,769
I said, "I hear you,
but there's a little bit more."

994
01:09:25,793 --> 01:09:28,204
This story's getting better, you know?

995
01:09:28,228 --> 01:09:29,379
And I'm excited for him.

996
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:30,639
And then he said her name,

997
01:09:30,663 --> 01:09:34,858
and when he said
her name, my heart dropped.

998
01:09:34,882 --> 01:09:36,132
"Oh, man."

999
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,686
And before that sunk in,
he said, "I asked her who my father was,

1000
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,585
and she said it's you."

1001
01:09:43,623 --> 01:09:47,623
And it was like a bomb went off.

1002
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:53,123
And he was silent for a couple of seconds.

1003
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:56,124
And then he started like mumbling.

1004
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:58,386
Coach Smith, he don't mumble now.

1005
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,213
He's a very articulate guy.

1006
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:03,996
I was mumbling.
"What are you talking about?"

1007
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:10,520
I knew I knew Carol.
I knew I knew her in that way.

1008
01:10:10,848 --> 01:10:14,260
After a few minutes,
I said, "I need to call you back.

1009
01:10:14,284 --> 01:10:17,284
I need to process this."

1010
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:22,306
It shook me. That was a...

1011
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:28,080
I didn't expect that.
It caught me off guard.

1012
01:10:29,636 --> 01:10:36,005
The fact that I knew Deland made
it harder, because this is a great guy.

1013
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:40,266
This young man grew up
without a father in his life.

1014
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:43,920
He didn't have what I had because of me,

1015
01:10:43,944 --> 01:10:47,356
because of being irresponsible.

1016
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,922
I said, "Deland,
I know that Carol is sure,

1017
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:53,444
but I wanna be sure."

1018
01:10:53,468 --> 01:10:55,357
So Deland said, "Let's do a DNA test."

1019
01:10:55,381 --> 01:11:00,631
I said, "Absolutely, let's do a DNA test."

1020
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:05,665
I woke up one morning and you know,
humility is not thinking less of yourself.

1021
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:09,100
It's thinking of yourself less.

1022
01:11:09,124 --> 01:11:12,971
God spoke to my heart and said,
"Stop thinking about yourself."

1023
01:11:12,995 --> 01:11:16,058
Then, I just started looking back
to how God connected the dots.

1024
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:21,669
I go back to, you know, if I don't
recruit him, I don't get to know him.

1025
01:11:21,693 --> 01:11:26,061
I've been in his life,
not in his life like a father should be.

1026
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:30,280
Deland told me,
he said, "You were in my life."

1027
01:11:30,304 --> 01:11:32,149
So the paternity test came back.

1028
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:34,803
My heart started beating.

1029
01:11:34,827 --> 01:11:41,370
When I opened it, I was like...
My hands were shaking when I read it.

1030
01:11:41,394 --> 01:11:44,066
It says a 99.99 percent chance

1031
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:48,502
that I'm his father, my wife,
Sharon, is jumping up and down screaming.

1032
01:11:48,526 --> 01:11:51,633
Like I was at a sporting event

1033
01:11:51,657 --> 01:11:56,330
at a football game
because I was just thrilled.

1034
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,604
I was absolutely thrilled.

1035
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:05,072
I definitely was all in.

1036
01:12:05,096 --> 01:12:10,073
I would have been devastated
had they came back any other way.

1037
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:14,378
I had already began
to bond with Deland and his family.

1038
01:12:14,402 --> 01:12:18,162
It just was all a dream come true.

1039
01:12:18,186 --> 01:12:21,337
It's a 99.9 percent chance.

1040
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:25,034
You know, my dad
called in, he's like, "Here we go."

1041
01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:28,730
You could hear it in his voice.
He was, "Let's do it."

1042
01:12:28,754 --> 01:12:34,004
You know, everything was on at that point.

1043
01:12:36,713 --> 01:12:38,384
And I go to Tennessee.

1044
01:12:38,408 --> 01:12:41,864
My dad knew I was coming, of course.

1045
01:12:41,888 --> 01:12:44,865
As I'm coming
around the corner up to his house,

1046
01:12:44,889 --> 01:12:47,431
I kind of pulled
right there on the side of the street.

1047
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:53,171
I was kind of sitting in the car,
trying to gather my thoughts.

1048
01:12:53,195 --> 01:12:55,259
He was sitting there
for about five minutes,

1049
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:56,476
I was looking for him.

1050
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,477
And he was sitting there,
then finally he pulls up in the driveway

1051
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:01,501
and he walks up.

1052
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:07,479
It ain't like I've never seen Coach Smith
before, but this is different now.

1053
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:13,393
I got out and, you know,
walked up to the... to the door.

1054
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:17,612
And I opened the door
and opened up my arms

1055
01:13:17,636 --> 01:13:22,261
and I said, "My son," and hugged him.

1056
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:31,007
I'd never heard
that before from a father figure.

1057
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,312
I'll never forget that.

1058
01:13:32,336 --> 01:13:36,835
I'll never forget the wave of emotion
that went through me when he said that.

1059
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:38,313
I don't have any words for it.

1060
01:13:38,337 --> 01:13:43,054
It just was like something
that I wanted for so long.

1061
01:13:43,078 --> 01:13:48,953
I never have been
referred to that by any man.

1062
01:13:49,253 --> 01:13:53,013
The strength of the way
he said it and the conviction in it,

1063
01:13:53,037 --> 01:13:56,666
and the fact that it was true, you know.

1064
01:13:56,690 --> 01:14:00,690
That's my son. I'm proud of him.

1065
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:05,451
I found my dad.

1066
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:08,600
You know, I found my dad.

1067
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:15,193
I didn't know what a dad
was supposed to look like.

1068
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,933
And then to find out
that my dad was Sherman Smith,

1069
01:14:18,957 --> 01:14:21,020
who I've been around enough to know,

1070
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:24,794
I just felt extremely blessed.

1071
01:14:25,568 --> 01:14:27,631
When he says, "My dad,"

1072
01:14:27,655 --> 01:14:31,762
there's such joy and happiness
that he can call Sherman "Dad."

1073
01:14:31,786 --> 01:14:35,068
But now, "That's my dad. That's my dad."

1074
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:36,217
You know?

1075
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:42,244
Every time Deland is around Sherman,
you say Sherman's name, the biggest,

1076
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:47,984
cheesiest grin comes up
on his face that's just amazing to me.

1077
01:14:48,008 --> 01:14:49,767
And I remember catching myself,

1078
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:52,289
and thinking to myself,
"Darnell, don't stare."

1079
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:56,334
Because I remember staring
at him and like listening to him talk.

1080
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:59,291
And I remember
he was chewing on a straw or something.

1081
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:07,315
I'm like, "Oh, my goodness. Deland
chews on straws all day, every day."

1082
01:15:13,145 --> 01:15:16,470
When I found out you was my dad,
man, it was like I hit the lottery.

1083
01:15:16,494 --> 01:15:20,949
You know, I just was so excited
that you were my father.

1084
01:15:20,973 --> 01:15:24,168
It was just such an unbelievable blessing.

1085
01:15:24,192 --> 01:15:26,386
God can take a mess
and make a miracle out of it.

1086
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,038
That's what He did.

1087
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:30,561
I always say
this is a story for God's glory.

1088
01:15:30,585 --> 01:15:32,430
I've always respected you and loved you

1089
01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:35,345
and so now to say you're my son,
what a blessing to me.

1090
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:41,303
It's only love of God
that got me to this point.

1091
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:43,563
I don't even use the word "luck."
"I'm lucky." No.

1092
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:45,086
I feel like luck can run out.

1093
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,696
You know, the love you have from God,

1094
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:53,845
I ain't never felt
like I ran out of God's love.

1095
01:15:54,678 --> 01:15:59,553
Man, I'm telling you, I'm blessed, man.

1096
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:21,443
I love to tell men
that it ain't over 'til it's over.

1097
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:26,140
And your kids may be grown
and gone, and you may have already failed.

1098
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:28,749
But God has a way of...
He has a tracking system.

1099
01:16:28,773 --> 01:16:33,403
He got a GPS,
so God knows how to turn things around

1100
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:40,448
when men are willing to repent,
that is the decision and determination

1101
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:42,927
to turn from sin and turn to Him.

1102
01:16:42,951 --> 01:16:46,624
Then God can kick in
and He can rev up that engine

1103
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:49,407
of restoration, help, and hope.

1104
01:16:49,431 --> 01:16:52,278
Every father is gonna be making mistakes

1105
01:16:52,302 --> 01:16:56,888
and needs the Lord every day,
and needs God's forgiveness

1106
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,454
and needs
the forgiveness of their children.

1107
01:16:59,478 --> 01:17:03,150
But there is also
this message in Scripture

1108
01:17:03,174 --> 01:17:06,151
that the fatherhood of God is perfect.

1109
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:10,804
All of God's attributes,
his characteristics,

1110
01:17:10,828 --> 01:17:12,805
are perfect in every detail.

1111
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:18,414
There is not a speck
of imperfection with God.

1112
01:17:18,438 --> 01:17:23,721
So that everything He says,
He's completely right about.

1113
01:17:23,745 --> 01:17:29,505
He's completely right about it,
not only informationally, but intuitively,

1114
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:32,404
because it's who He is.

1115
01:17:32,964 --> 01:17:38,029
The reason why you can trust Him
is that He cannot make a mistake.

1116
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:41,725
Anybody that good at what they do

1117
01:17:41,749 --> 01:17:49,249
is worthy of our trust
even when we do not understand them.

1118
01:17:53,448 --> 01:17:57,947
Today on Focus on the Family, we'll
get some insight from a couple of dads

1119
01:17:57,971 --> 01:18:02,035
who talk about the power
of a father's words and actions.

1120
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:03,818
John, many of us know the heartache.

1121
01:18:03,842 --> 01:18:08,037
At Focus, we had
the real estate collapse of '07 and '08

1122
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:11,124
and we had to lay off... I had to lay off...

1123
01:18:11,148 --> 01:18:14,734
600 people over a three-year period.

1124
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:19,257
And I remember one night,
I was down in the basement of my house.

1125
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:24,258
And I was sleeping an hour or two a night
because of the stress of this.

1126
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:26,302
And I remember Dr. Dobson would say to me,

1127
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:28,824
when he didn't know what to do
with Focus on the Family

1128
01:18:28,848 --> 01:18:31,042
in the early days, he'd call his dad.

1129
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:35,000
And his dad would always have
the right word of wisdom.

1130
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:39,871
And I'm down in this basement
going, "I don't have a dad.

1131
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:42,655
Lord, why didn't You give me
a dad I could call?

1132
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:45,699
Because I need wisdom right now.

1133
01:18:45,723 --> 01:18:49,848
But You didn't give me that dad."

1134
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:53,744
And I'm telling you, it wasn't audible,

1135
01:18:53,768 --> 01:19:00,225
but what I heard in my spirit
with a tonal quality was:

1136
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:03,999
"Haven't I been a good father?

1137
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,240
What do you need?"

1138
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:20,142
And I went down
on my face and began to weep.

1139
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:25,970
Just saying, "You've been the best father
a boy could have.

1140
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:32,189
You've been everything.
Look at what You've done for me."

1141
01:19:32,213 --> 01:19:34,668
If you don't have a dad,

1142
01:19:34,692 --> 01:19:38,974
God is standing there,
saying, "I will be this for you.

1143
01:19:38,998 --> 01:19:43,235
And I'll be the best father
you could ever have."

1144
01:19:43,259 --> 01:19:48,009
And that's what's happened in my life.

1145
01:19:49,784 --> 01:19:53,456
The Holy Spirit
is looking for the broken spirit,

1146
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,413
the person that's wounded.

1147
01:19:55,437 --> 01:20:00,153
Because there's some kind of humility,
I think, that comes from brokenness.

1148
01:20:00,177 --> 01:20:05,111
When you don't have the answers,
maybe somebody has wounded you.

1149
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:08,764
And at that point,
there's nowhere else to go

1150
01:20:08,788 --> 01:20:13,243
and you're saying, "Lord, if You're there,
will you show Yourself to me?"

1151
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,940
He's whispering, "I've always been here.

1152
01:20:16,964 --> 01:20:23,339
I've just been waiting
for you to call out to Me."

1153
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:31,319
What I needed was a father,
and I found that person in Christ.

1154
01:20:43,232 --> 01:20:46,600
We can restore and turn back

1155
01:20:46,624 --> 01:20:49,558
and get back
what the Enemy has taken away.

1156
01:20:49,582 --> 01:20:53,207
So the bad news is, it's bad.

1157
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:57,299
The good news is, God can make it better

1158
01:20:57,323 --> 01:21:02,518
because He who has begun a good work
in you, if you let Him complete it

1159
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:05,823
as your daddy, as your Father in heaven...

1160
01:21:05,847 --> 01:21:11,563
He can take that misery
and turn it into your miracle.

1161
01:21:11,587 --> 01:21:13,911
He can turn this nation around

1162
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:19,304
if He can get men to become the kind
of fathers He's created them to be.

1163
01:21:19,328 --> 01:21:23,175
It's been amazing to me
that some of the best dads in the world

1164
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,828
that I've ever met
had terrible dads themselves.

1165
01:21:26,852 --> 01:21:31,220
And it was a great day when they realized,
I don't have to carry on this legacy

1166
01:21:31,244 --> 01:21:36,918
of baggage and hurt
and absence on to my own children.

1167
01:21:36,942 --> 01:21:41,006
My own father
was not looking at his own dad

1168
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:44,746
as the example to pass on to us.
He was reading the Scriptures.

1169
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,007
He was reading books by great men.

1170
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:49,529
He was on his knees
asking God to help him.

1171
01:21:49,553 --> 01:21:55,140
And I'm so grateful that he let go
of those tough cards that he'd been dealt.

1172
01:21:55,164 --> 01:22:02,539
And he decided to pass on
a new legacy for us as his kids.

1173
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:11,405
I used to wish
that I could be affirmed more.

1174
01:22:11,429 --> 01:22:14,145
And when I learned about the Jewish people

1175
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:18,494
and how they speak blessings
over their children,

1176
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:26,518
I chose to pray for each of my sons
when they were getting married.

1177
01:22:26,563 --> 01:22:30,105
He had turned a corner
with his own walk with God,

1178
01:22:30,129 --> 01:22:34,585
and determined
to tell his sons that they were loved,

1179
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:38,890
to pray over them,
to encourage them, and to bless them.

1180
01:22:38,914 --> 01:22:42,457
In the Bible,
the blessing was everything. Everything.

1181
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:47,545
That blessing was the covenantal transfer

1182
01:22:47,569 --> 01:22:52,329
of the favor of God
for the future of the child.

1183
01:22:52,353 --> 01:22:59,157
They long for that blessing,
that passing of divine favor.

1184
01:22:59,181 --> 01:23:05,332
Every father is responsible
for passing on the blessing.

1185
01:23:05,356 --> 01:23:09,356
There was the touch of transfer.

1186
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:14,401
I am passing on what God has given me...

1187
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:16,098
to you.

1188
01:23:19,143 --> 01:23:27,143
It was at my wedding that he gave me
what I'll call a "formal public blessing."

1189
01:23:28,928 --> 01:23:33,122
Well, I don't think people
were expecting what was about to happen.

1190
01:23:33,146 --> 01:23:37,384
We were not realizing
what was about to happen.

1191
01:23:37,408 --> 01:23:39,776
He tells me
in front of the whole congregation:

1192
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,342
"I see you as a man, a grown man.

1193
01:23:42,366 --> 01:23:45,387
I bless you, I believe in you."

1194
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:47,735
He told me he loved me
in front of the audience.

1195
01:23:47,759 --> 01:23:49,562
He blessed me in front of the audience.

1196
01:23:49,586 --> 01:23:52,649
Told me he's proud of me
in front of the audience.

1197
01:23:52,673 --> 01:23:56,085
And I just remembered thinking,
"Wow, you're pushing all the buttons

1198
01:23:56,109 --> 01:23:58,694
that men wanna hear their dad say."

1199
01:23:58,718 --> 01:24:02,782
When Dad began to bless Alex,
it wasn't just this,

1200
01:24:02,806 --> 01:24:06,348
you know, "God bless you.
I hope things turn out well."

1201
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:08,349
It went on and on.

1202
01:24:08,373 --> 01:24:11,437
It was like this river
that just kept flowing

1203
01:24:11,461 --> 01:24:15,612
and speaking success
over the future of his son.

1204
01:24:15,636 --> 01:24:18,917
People were just weeping...

1205
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:22,440
because they'd never seen a dad

1206
01:24:22,464 --> 01:24:27,223
love his son unconditionally
like that before.

1207
01:24:27,247 --> 01:24:30,050
So that's the way
he sends me off to start our family.

1208
01:24:30,074 --> 01:24:35,699
I lacked nothing emotionally
or in my heart.

1209
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:38,201
I'm leaving full.

1210
01:24:38,468 --> 01:24:42,445
There's no better person
to do that than your dad telling you,

1211
01:24:42,469 --> 01:24:44,469
"You are a man."

1212
01:24:47,948 --> 01:24:53,708
After my blessing, Dad did the same thing
for our brother Shannon at his wedding.

1213
01:24:53,732 --> 01:25:01,015
It took me months of rehearsing
in my own mind and practicing quietly

1214
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:06,321
even in the middle of the night
when I'd wake up and think about it.

1215
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:12,800
But I spoke to Shannon
and his bride from Deuteronomy 28,

1216
01:25:12,824 --> 01:25:18,107
where it says, "If you hearken diligently
unto the voice of the Lord thy God,

1217
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:26,131
to do and to keep his commandments,
all these blessings shall come upon you."

1218
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,544
So when I got married,

1219
01:25:28,568 --> 01:25:34,719
at the end of the ceremony,
Dad says, "I want to bless you."

1220
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:38,243
And Dad just says, "My son,"

1221
01:25:38,527 --> 01:25:43,896
and then he told me
what he thought about me.

1222
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:51,920
I declare that you are a beloved son
in whom we are well pleased.

1223
01:25:53,226 --> 01:25:55,942
I bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus

1224
01:25:55,966 --> 01:26:00,161
that you may proclaim the Gospel
with joy and enthusiasm,

1225
01:26:00,185 --> 01:26:06,206
that you may be a man
of integrity, sincere in every good work.

1226
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:09,772
I bless you
to be a spiritual leader to your wife,

1227
01:26:09,796 --> 01:26:12,773
to be a channel of blessings to others.

1228
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:15,252
May the Lord shine His face upon you.

1229
01:26:15,276 --> 01:26:17,383
May He be gracious unto you.

1230
01:26:17,407 --> 01:26:23,036
May He give you peace is our prayer
in the name of the Lord Jesus.

1231
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,951
I remember standing there thinking:

1232
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:28,517
"I don't deserve this.

1233
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,821
I haven't earned this."

1234
01:26:30,845 --> 01:26:32,909
But it wasn't about that.

1235
01:26:32,933 --> 01:26:37,308
It was about the heart of a father.

1236
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:49,609
I would tell anyone who has longed
for a blessing

1237
01:26:49,633 --> 01:26:52,566
from their father and never gotten it,

1238
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:55,915
that you can get it through Jesus.

1239
01:26:55,939 --> 01:26:59,742
That you can look at Ephesians
and say, "Because of my faith in Christ,

1240
01:26:59,766 --> 01:27:05,743
this is what my Heavenly Father
thinks about me."

1241
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,527
We had a time in our church
where I preached on the blessing

1242
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:11,485
of Jacob and Esau.

1243
01:27:11,509 --> 01:27:16,051
And I said, "If you have not been blessed,
come forward."

1244
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:21,950
Hundreds of men,
hundreds of men came forward.

1245
01:27:22,685 --> 01:27:26,310
The longing for the blessing.

1246
01:27:26,426 --> 01:27:27,801
They cried.

1247
01:27:28,556 --> 01:27:31,098
They were living under a cloud.

1248
01:27:31,122 --> 01:27:32,490
A sense of being cursed.

1249
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:38,100
Because they're doing the same things
their daddy did. Same sins, same anger.

1250
01:27:38,124 --> 01:27:40,101
I prayed a prayer of blessing.

1251
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,231
There was weeping and wailing

1252
01:27:42,255 --> 01:27:47,059
at that feeling
that the future could be different

1253
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:50,669
because I'm living now
under the blessing of God

1254
01:27:50,693 --> 01:27:54,191
and not under the cursing of my dad.

1255
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:58,931
We have a generation of unblessed children

1256
01:27:58,955 --> 01:28:05,151
because the fathers
did not transfer the blessing.

1257
01:28:05,175 --> 01:28:09,630
The words that a father speaks
over his children are so crucial.

1258
01:28:09,654 --> 01:28:13,529
They'll remember what you said.

1259
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:18,324
A positive blessing over your kids...

1260
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:19,633
is incredible.

1261
01:28:19,657 --> 01:28:25,287
And it has so much far-reaching impact
in our lives.

1262
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:28,311
From this day forward...

1263
01:28:28,789 --> 01:28:33,506
may God's hand
of goodness rest on your life.

1264
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:36,680
May you experience His love...

1265
01:28:36,704 --> 01:28:38,942
His forgiveness...

1266
01:28:38,966 --> 01:28:40,466
His power...

1267
01:28:41,184 --> 01:28:43,184
His provision...

1268
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:47,500
for everything that you touch.

1269
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:49,251
Your wife...

1270
01:28:49,794 --> 01:28:51,728
your children...

1271
01:28:51,752 --> 01:28:53,002
your work.

1272
01:28:54,013 --> 01:29:01,688
May His hand of goodness cover you
because you're underneath His covenant.

1273
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:08,087
And may you walk now
in victory and not in defeat.

1274
01:29:08,756 --> 01:29:11,381
In Jesus' name, amen.

1275
01:29:17,759 --> 01:29:23,759
It's almost like
we've got this piece of glass.

1276
01:29:26,413 --> 01:29:29,086
And we've got a picture
of our earthly father

1277
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:31,985
on that piece of glass.

1278
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:38,262
And then we begin to project upon God

1279
01:29:38,286 --> 01:29:42,911
the attributes of our earthly father.

1280
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:50,526
We must erase the things
about our earthly father

1281
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,222
that don't look like God.

1282
01:29:52,246 --> 01:29:59,121
And we begin to look at God
through the lens of Jesus.

1283
01:30:11,381 --> 01:30:13,663
There are so many people
walking around, going:

1284
01:30:13,687 --> 01:30:19,621
"Show me God.
I can't see Him. I can't hear Him.

1285
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:23,273
Where is God? Show me the Father."

1286
01:30:23,297 --> 01:30:27,580
Jesus says,
"Don't you realize this whole time

1287
01:30:27,604 --> 01:30:30,537
I have been representing
the Father to you.

1288
01:30:30,561 --> 01:30:33,538
If you've seen Me, you've seen the Father.

1289
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:37,190
I'm pouring out the love
of the Father to you."

1290
01:30:37,214 --> 01:30:40,147
Through our faith in Him,
we can know the Father.

1291
01:30:40,171 --> 01:30:45,584
We can know the heart
of the Father, His love for us."

1292
01:30:45,608 --> 01:30:53,358
Jesus said, "I came
to introduce you to the Heavenly Father."
