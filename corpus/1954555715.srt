00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:41,191
<i> DAY 14 
After talking with the Lord ... </i>

176
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:43,193
Ashton A resident for 50 years.

177
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,823
He said he warned 
the boys to leave.

178
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,620
I do not like it.

179
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,050
Having spoken to the Lord ...

180
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,435
A resident of Ashton for 50 years ...

181
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,849
Did you hear the scandal <i>? 
Today he said the craziest ... </i>

182
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,229
<i> 'Get out of this place, is evil.' </i>

183
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,269
But he kept saying as 
I was convinced,

184
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,275
as if he knew that he spoke.

185
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,409
It was so weird!

186
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:31,200
It sounded as if he knew something or 
something, or as if he knew me ...

187
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,083
Are you listening?

188
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,886
- Richie! 
- What?

189
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:48,217
- Hello? 
- Hey, baby this was an old hippie ...

190
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,677
Sure ... this hallucinating.

191
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,517
MURDER IN SOUTHLAND <i> 
He said God told him to do so 
What are we seeing? </i>

192
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,621
Did I tell you how sexy are you today?

193
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:19,581
No.

194
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,674
Honey ...

195
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,719
Dad is trying to do something.

196
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,680
Later.

197
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,489
Are you thinking what 
I'm thinking?

198
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,549
Saved by the bell.

199
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,961
- Let it ring. 
- No! Invite!

200
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,463
We can not leave them there.

201
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,758
Do not worry, 
you'll get your reward.

202
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,552
- Are you serious? 
- If.

203
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,181
Hey!

204
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,747
Are you ready?

205
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:22,853
- Yes. 
- Ok.

206
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,064
- Hello! 
- Hello, how are you?!

207
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,151
Hello Emma!

208
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:31,660
Hello!

209
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,697
Hi Mike!

210
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,950
Wait, wait.

211
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,536
No more school!

212
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,625
We rented the movie 'The Legend', 
if you are in the mood to be scared.

213
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,677
The only way we see it, 
if Rick is not falling asleep.

214
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,359
Yes, we can realize 
When sleeping, right?

215
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,007
Because the whole room vibrates.

216
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,012
I love your baby snoring.

217
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,682
Guys! What happens to this 
city? Everything is so dead!

218
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:02,274
It's like a ghost town.

219
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,938
Welcome to Ashton, of 
where everyone wants to flee.

220
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,276
Ok, ok, tiger waiting!

221
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,781
- Hi Jess! 
- Hey guys!

222
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,458
- What are you doing? 
- Beer is good.

223
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,336
Another call from the apartment <i> 202. </i>

224
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,296
<i> loud complaint. </i>

225
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:32,898
Watch <i> that. </i>

226
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,466
Understood <i>. </i>

227
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:41,348
<i> would gather, and watched movies 
scandal many complaints we received. </i>

228
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:43,392
<i> I often found myself going. </i>

229
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,979
Do you realize that there was a 
girl killed in this building?

230
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,565
AWFUL!

231
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,317
Can we see the movie?

232
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,864
No one was killed here, I hope. 
- Not at this apartment Adam.

233
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,701
Legend has it that in 1972 ...

234
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,121
There was a girl who was raped ...

235
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,495
Tortured and then murdered ... ...

236
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,799
... In the basement of this building.

237
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,218
- Who did it? 
- Nobody knows friend.

238
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,755
His parents paid the 
city ​​for what it concealed.

239
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,258
Why parents would do something like that?

240
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,135
I do not know, but it worked right?

241
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,762
There is no research 
real, the case was closed ...

242
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,682
This building has been 
closed for 30 years.

243
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:24,909
Closed and desolate.

244
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:26,101
That is a fact.

245
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,157
<i> During the course of my investigation ... </i>

246
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,445
I found that the first <i> 
killings began in 1972. </i>

247
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,573
<i> 1972 
What the hell happened here? </i>

248
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,533
You want me to go down?

249
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,660
Leave it to the coroner.

250
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,880
In this play the good guy.

251
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,133
Whoever it was, 
did not like him very well, right?

252
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,677
Want to do a forensic examination?

253
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,518
Nothing release.

254
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,020
I do not want this shit, quit.

255
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,355
Understood.

256
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,656
<i> right, back, back. </i>

257
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,201
All <i> back, take away their cameras. </i>

258
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,661
Richie is cute, but 
Emma is lying.

259
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,303
They needed more flats 
students, that's all.

260
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:24,910
Anyway, I like, is more 
cheaper than the dorms ...

261
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:26,870
And no time of arrival 
and any rules.

262
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:29,588
This place is a fucking dump!

263
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:33,105
I say we destroy, what 
re-build with new things.

264
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,553
That makes no sense, why 
would rebuild it?

265
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,466
Every time I try to do, the 
workers disappear without a trace.

266
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:44,054
Yeah right, just do not want 
spend more money ...

267
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,557
Re-build ... 
A building in good condition.

268
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:51,391
O. .. Maybe she was, maybe 
is the girl who was killed.

269
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:55,602
Yeah, yeah, maybe this trying 
do all to remember.

270
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:59,778
And why would close a Building 
whole by a single murder?

271
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:01,787
Had something to say 
do with devil worship.

272
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,241
Ok, enough with the stories 
ghosts! Rich're scaring me!

273
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,619
Can not we just 
see the movie?!

274
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,840

- I think not.

No fall, probably ...

289
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,617

00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,746
- Hello. 
- Hello.

291
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,729
I'm new to the building and 
I did not bother, but ...

292
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,295
Everything is so quiet ... 
and do not know anyone here yet.

293
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:44,424
- Do you mind? 
- No! Come in, we're just talking.

Yes, this is boring, I'll go with you.

- You're great! 
- I'll be back then.

324
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,808
While three people are 
doing other classes ...

Come on baby, I 
had a long day.

00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:03,076
In the first year, I was 
studying in Germany and Spain.

349
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,206
If ...

350
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,750
Well Amber ...

351
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,795
Tell us about your 
crazy sexual experiences.

352
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:19,009
- I have no. 
- Oh come on, everyone has one!

353
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:22,888
Well ... I used to date 
a boy named Henry.

354
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,349
Y. ..

355
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,358
My parents did not like him.

356
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:31,313
Who would care? 
Was good fucking?

357
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:37,736
I do not know ... He was more interested 
in other things, I guess.

358
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:39,947
What? Was he gay?

359
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,221
Leave her alone Jessica, 
not everyone likes ...

360
00:29:44,222 --> 00:29:46,995
Talk about their stuff ... 
personal as you.

361
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:50,290
Oh come on, come on! This is 
interesting, tell us he was gay?

362
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,554
Adam! You want to come here?

363
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,265
You can bring with you all.

364
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,645
Kelly <i> on! </i>

365
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,821
Kelly here!

366
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,650
<i> old stayed out 
from home, again ... </i>

367
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:19,236
<i> neighbors say the nude. </i>

368
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,532
Again? As that 
I'm in the middle of something.

369
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,952
It's an old <i> Kelly! 
You have to go now! </i>

370
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,372
Okay, I'm on my way.

371
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,250
If caught smoking 
that crap again

372
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,377
I'm going to take a 
All the curator.

373
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,851
- What?! 
- Do not do that!

374
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:51,643
Sorry!

375
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,043
Hello?

376
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,462
Is there anybody out there?

377
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,672
Hello?

378
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,240
Hey, I've been looking for!

379
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,930
What are you singing?

380
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,203
- It's an old church song, 
my Mom used to sing.

381
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:55,207
I should pay more attention.

382
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,751
It's getting cold, 
Want to go inside?

383
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,420
If.

384
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,747
<i> Like getting caught, right? </i>

385
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,795
<i> Kill </i>

386
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:49,678
<i> Want My ... Within you? </i>

387
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:04,234
<i> Stay calm! </i>

388
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,880
Who wants one?

389
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:34,431
Shit!

390
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,729
Where is my lighter?

391
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:49,363
All the lights went out!

392
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,950
Must be the wiring, again!

393
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,130
Honey! That was not funny!

394
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:03,376
So what? Are we going to be 
sitting here in the dark?

395
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:06,588
Insurance is the fuse, as 
spent a couple of weeks ago.

396
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:11,093
Just be here, does the 
fuses are lit again sometimes?

397
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:15,097
Not in this building, because everything 
including wiring is very old.

398
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,141
- Where's the box? 
- Somewhere in the basement.

399
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:20,018
Rich is always 
it is fixing.

400
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:21,812
Mimi stay quiet.

401
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,948
So ... Can not call the owner?

402
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,111
- This holiday. 
​​- The lanterns are in the cabinet.

403
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:33,907
Maybe we should go down and 
to fix ourselves.

404
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,078
Did you hear something?

405
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,832
It is an old building, 
Who's coming with me?

406
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,129
Fags!

407
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,051
Do not delay!

408
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:14,406
Ok, wait. I have one, look ...

409
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,832
A guy walks into a room.

410
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,834
He sits beside his father.

411
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,587
Dad has a note 
big smile on his face.

412
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:25,042
Son says why have that great 
smile?! Then, the son says ...

413
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:28,045
Well Dad, last night 
I had my first blowjob.

414
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:34,051
So excited and dad 
gave a couple of pats on the back.

415
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:35,987
And said, son sit down and tell me everything.

416
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:37,888
So the son said, well daddy ...

417
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,808
I got on my knees and I 
got a penis to mouth ...

418
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:45,896
That is so disgusting 
honey! Very disgusting!

419
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,943
- It is true story. 
- Happened to you?

420
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,675
No, I'm here, this is me.

421
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:57,074
- That shows 
where your mind goes.

422
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:59,910
You see, if you see a light, 
I'm right here.

423
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,204
That speak.

424
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,087
I'm freezing!

425
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,590
- I know! 
- When coming back Richie?

426
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,336
You know what, you think you have 
all the time in the world.

427
00:36:09,371 --> 00:36:12,523
Have not you noticed how cold 
it is getting here?

428
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:15,676
Probably missed, 
I mean, this place is huge.

429
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,513
Look, I spent an hour 
and I'm freezing.

430
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,683
Or go down and 
we managed ...

431
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:26,854
- ... or I'll go home. 
- I'm not leaving until Richie returns.

432
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:27,896
Neither do I.

433
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,156
I'll go.

434
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,464
Me too, I'll go with you Jess ...

435
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,737
Adam ... and stay here and 
care of the girls, okay?

436
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:38,163
Oh, ok! Yeah, great!

437
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,325
Do not worry, Mom and returns.

438
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:44,371
Be a good girl, 
do not give them problems.

439
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,213
Hey.

440
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,770
- How are you? 
- Well.

441
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,293
Honey, I'll go with you!

442
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,722
Who's there?

443
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,519
I heard something.

444
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,771
Hey Rich are you down here?

445
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,691
Are you? What's this?

446
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,528
It's nothing, moving on.

447
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:36,048
Look, if someone is here 
You better stop messing around ...

448
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,466
I have a deck and I'll use it.

449
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,596
- Yes, I have. 
- Honey, you may not see us.

450
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:45,849
- Honey ... Not now, quiet. 
- Ok.

451
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:50,229
Maybe we should go back 
and wait until morning.

452
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:51,688
Yeah, maybe we should.

453
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,865
The sooner, the better.

454
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,362
If sigámonos moving, going to see 
the case and if it is not, we returned.

455
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,416
- Are they good? 
- If.

456
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:12,042
If.

457
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,878
There's our stalker.

458
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,089
That's not funny honey.

459
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:29,017
This is disgusting! No 
I came to do this.

460
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:30,435
It should be in Cabo.

461
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,739
Rich!

462
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,201
Rich!

463
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:48,829
Rich!

464
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,373
Richie are you down here?

465
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,672
There's no one here.

466
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,009
Guys, find a 
Rich and get out of here!

467
00:39:02,044 --> 00:39:04,094
This place is giving me chills.

468
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,597
I think it's around here somewhere.

469
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,203
Everything is so old!

470
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:10,809
And dusty!

471
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,874
There must be some 
kind of law against this.

472
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:16,231
The city needs to know 
this is crazy.

473
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,903
Did you hear that? There's something there.

474
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:24,781
After what just happened, 
I'm curious to know what it is.

475
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,129
A mouse? Is all this 
mouse shit?!

476
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,382
Did she?

477
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,763
- I just want out of here. 
- Can not we find this thing and go?

478
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,264
We're coming.

479
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:52,768
I think this is, this is!

480
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:56,605
We gotta go, 
I have to take a bath.

481
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,569
- What the fuck? 
- What happens?

482
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:07,241
Damn! I just ruin a 
pair of $ 300.

483
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,640
This is weird ...

484
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,204
- Honey, what do you this 
taking so long?!

485
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,956
Cables, connectors ...

486
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:17,000
- ... Everything is new! 
- What are you doing?

487
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,273
What are you saying?

488
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,213
Something does not make sense.

489
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,841
Rich said this happened 
He revised recently and ...

490
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:25,884
Because they had old wiring.

491
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:29,429
Something does not make sense.

492
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:32,140
- What do you think? 
- Who the hell knows!

493
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:34,017
Ok, enough with the light!

494
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:37,855
Where did Kait and Amber?

495
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,817
They were right here.

496
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:43,402
I saw no go!

497
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,488
Kait! Amber!

498
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:50,159
Stop joking 
girls, not funny!

499
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,264
Kait! Amber!

500
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:53,787
Say something!

501
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,915
Maybe they were 
up and realized ...

502
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:58,375
... This was a big waste of time.

503
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,925
I should go with them.

504
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,087
No, Kait would not leave without saying something.

505
00:41:02,122 --> 00:41:04,214
Maybe not so well know your girl.

506
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,133
I'm going back up.

507
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,178
See you! I'll tell 
send them greetings.

508
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,369
<i> DAY 21 </i>

509
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:30,032
<i> had a single hospital in the city ... </i>

510
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,665
Mercy Memorial <i>. </i>

511
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,244
<i> where all the bodies were sent. </i>

512
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,458
How beautiful!

513
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:47,424
You'll be perfect.

514
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,387
Oh yeah!

515
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:11,073
What do we have here?

516
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:14,868
A young girl.

517
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:16,912
And something like 20 years.

518
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,879
Linda!

519
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,007
What is your story?

520
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,741
So soft!

521
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,279
You've been a very bad girl!

522
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,502
It is like putting wet.

523
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:48,045
When these events <i>

If then when 
I came back, my brother and I ...

527
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,043
Went backpacking ... 
in Europe, for a month.

528
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,588
Adam! If you think we 
're doing feel better ...

529
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,340
You're not doing.

530
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,676
Forgiveness.

531
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,013
What I believe this 
taking so long?

532
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:46,735
Hey Mimi! I miss you Mom!

533
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,988
- Did you miss Mommy? 
- Did you find the problem?

534
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:54,236
If ... And apparently everything is 
new, not old, as Rich said.

535
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:55,529
You found Rich?

536
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:58,240
No.

537
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,083
- Kait and Amber again? 
- They have not returned.

538
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:04,663
- We have not seen. 
- Great, now they are gone?

539
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:07,457
Probably found a 
Richard laughing at us.

540
00:45:07,492 --> 00:45:08,959
Click idiot!

541
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,733
You have to pee!

542
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,721
Have to pee.

543
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,508
Oh c'mon darling! Go!

544

00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,913
The door is closed, do not want to open.

552
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:29,748
- What? 
- Is stuck!

553
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,919

- Okay.

Not this! Not! 
We gotta get out of here!

Oh my God! How are we 
out of here? Jessica!

562
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:09,204
- Jessica! 
- Open this door!

563
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:10,706
Rich is with you??

564
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:15,544
- Did you see Rich? Let's go for it! 
- No!

565
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,429
He killed Kaitlin ...

566
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:22,176
- ... And is now behind me! 
- No! God, no!

567
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:24,845
No, no, no, no!

568
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:27,556
Rich would not do that! He is my friend!

569
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,767
He's not that person!

570
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:42,077
Open the door!

571
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,990
- We can not open the door! 
- Open up!

572
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,386
It's blood!

573
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:01,465
What the hell just happened?

574
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,508
Are you okay?

575
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,304
- Where is everybody? 
- Jessica still out there!

576
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:08,680
Everyone is still out there.

577
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:14,895
Do not want to die, I want to have children, 
I want to travel, I want to lose my virginity!

578
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,939
? Can close the fuck up!?

579
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:20,824
- Rich still out there. 
- We have to go for it!

580
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:23,028
- And bring all and leave. 
- I can not.

581
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,739
Kait and he killed Amber.

582
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,325
Freddy not be stupid!

583
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,496
We gotta go!

584
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:37,250
Richie??

585
00:48:37,285 --> 00:48:38,877
Are you?

586
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:42,047
- Do not do this! 
- Rich, talk about this friend.

587
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:44,466
If this is about the 
student loans,

588
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,593
I'll lend you the money, just do not kill me!

589
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,847
- What about us? 
- I say, do not kill us!

590
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,182
Richie, stop!

591
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,393
Why are you doing this?!

592
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:01,108
Do you think he was?

593
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,406
If ...

594
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,000
Hello! Open up, it's cold here.

595
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:21,003
- Is Jessica. 
- Hey, Rich is out there!

596
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:24,190
What are you talking? No 
no one out here!

597
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:27,342
- Promise?! 
- Hell, Open to me!

598
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,014
Get in, join this group!

599
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:35,232
- Price are crazy! 
- Rich has gone mad ...

600
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:37,769
Kaitlin and killed ... Amber and 
now is trying to kill us.

601
00:49:37,804 --> 00:49:40,981
What? Rich could not even 
even kill himself.

602
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:43,713
Just surprise us all.

603
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:46,403
Let me guess, you were attacked ...

604
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,615
Please, go clean 
fake blood on your shirt.

605
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,873
This is serious!

606
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:52,951
Did not you hear anything 
you just said?

607
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:59,124
I get it!

608
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:02,753
Rich is trying to kill me.

609
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:09,635
Oh Adam ... Save me!

610
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,555
Save me!

611
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,849
You are pathetic!

612
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,622
- So you did not see 
anyone out there?

613
00:50:18,623 --> 00:50:20,562
- No! And for some reason, 
all doors are closed.

614
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:23,524
My baby had to pee inside.

615
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:28,160
- We gotta get out of here. 
- There are bars on all windows.

616
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:31,907
There is no way out for a 
window and ruin a fine pair of shoes.

617
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:35,619
There is a door in the first Ala D 
floor, and I know the code, okay?

618
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,454
Well come on! 
- Come on.

619
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,123
- We have to be together right? 
- Ok.

620
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:44,002
Great, I'm being carried by 
and someone who can barely speak.

621
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,184
This clear, let's move.

622
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,524
This is ridiculous! You are crazy!

623
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:16,326
God! Thank you, guys!

624
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,706
- Mimi, come back here! 
- Jess where are you going?

625
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:24,168
Jess! Jess! Jessica!

626
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,679
- Fuck Friend! 
- We have to keep moving!

627
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,592
- No! We can not leave! 
- We have to keep moving!

628
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:33,177
No. ..

629
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,811
- I'll stay. 
- What?!

630
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:38,188
- What do you say? 
- I'll stay with her.

631
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,357
- Are you crazy? 
- Wait, you can not stay.

632
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:42,373
Maybe she is right and is 
some kind of sick joke,

633
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:44,354
that someone is doing.

634
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:45,772
Adam, think about what you say!

635
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,380
I'm going to stay and is the last word!

636
00:51:49,415 --> 00:51:51,612
Okay! We 
to keep moving.

637
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:54,698
- I'll be fine. 
- Be careful.

638

Hello? Is there anyone here?

653
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:30,878

- We were here

There must be another way.

680
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,639

Nobody lives here.

707
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,869
We saw the police

726
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,839
Everything is the same, painting 
handle, scratches ...

Nothing out of the ordinary.

736
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,348
You can not hear us.

737
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,385
It knows we're here.

738
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,637

Shit! Shit!

Shit! Tell me this ...

747
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,098
How does Richard could 
close all doors?

748
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,227
Does the emergency exit?

749
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,229
It's impossible!

750
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:54,490
Hey, where were 
playing football today ...

751
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:57,319
Adam noticed that the bars in the 
second floor had disappeared.

752
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,134
Maybe we can top 
and down the pipe.

753
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:02,533
And we could go to the 
city ​​and ask for help.

754
01:03:02,568 --> 01:03:04,451
Who is going to believe?

755
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,371
Who would care if we believe? 
At least we're out of here.

756
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:10,165
Right, let's come.

757
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:22,511
Oh shit! Shit! Shit!

758

They're all dead! You killed them!

Haili, baby go!

You know I did not kill anybody, 
not like killing anything.

827
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,101
Remember that rat in the bathroom? 
I said I'd take care of it,

You do not think someone kills you?

834
01:10:24,259 --> 01:10:25,642

980
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:49,149
She said they had 
a connection of souls.

981
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:53,821

986
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:21,181
And I saw that the Doctor was sodomizándola.

987
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:26,186
And I never said anything, nobody ...

988
01:26:26,221 --> 01:26:27,646

See? It was not until five years ago ...

991
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:42,369
After Henry died, 
was packing her things ...

992
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,497
And I found her diary.

993
01:26:46,832 --> 01:26:48,792

994
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,235

OK, but the satanic cult ...

I was wrong!

1009
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:05,410
My father told me that the girl was 
involved with a satanic cult ...

1010
01:28:05,445 --> 01:28:08,539
They promised the 
immortality or something.

1011

- Oh yeah, yeah!
