1
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:12,521
-Hey, boy. Hey. Hey, look.
-Look what?

2
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,579
Hey.

3
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:16,126
Hey, you better chill.

4
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:18,128
Hey, hey. Shit, nigger.

5
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,237
Stop putting your hands up.

6
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:29,864
This is a bridge.

7
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,067
Hold on. Hold on.

8
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:32,865
Shit.

9
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,090
Tommy?

10
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:56,531
Tommy, come on, man. Wake up, bro.

11
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,627
Tommy, we hit somebody. Damn.

12
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,867
Come on. We gotta get the fuck out of here.

13
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,527
<i>Every once in a proverbial blue moon</i>
<i>we stumble across an author</i>

14
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,227
who may verily change our lives.

15
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,430
Someone from we know not from where,
perhaps even Dante's own paradise,

16
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:45,435
who assembles the words
that we must read and hear.

17
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,739
None of your scribbler of syntax,

18
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:50,940
but a heavenly scribe of powerful ideas.

19
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,142
An absolute and true author.

20
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,083
Ladies and gentleman,
I present to you Thomas Carter.

21
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,455
We can do better than that for Thomas.

22
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,354
You're welcome.

23
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,535
May I ask you about
your near death experience?

24
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,867
Did you see a white light?

25
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,470
No. Nothing like that.

26
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,068
What did happen?

27
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:26,481
Well, that's for the next book.

28
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,778
Thank you.

29
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,251
You're welcome.

30
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,616
Could you make this out

31
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,022
to Angel, please?

32
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:37,189
-Sure.
-Thank you.

33
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:45,964
You've read this a lot.

34
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:47,837
Yeah.

35
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,605
"It's better to light a candle
than to curse the darkness."

36
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,469
Why did you write that quote?

37
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,647
Well, it harkens back to a wise proverb.

38
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,218
"Self-doubt can be a demon."

39
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:07,250
I try to warn people to be mindful

40
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:10,122
of the difference between
what's harmful and what's reflective.

41
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,424
Do you do one-on-one sessions?

42
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,897
No. Sorry, not anymore.

43
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,626
But I can refer you elsewhere.

44
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,100
If you change your mind,

45
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,239
I could pay your fee.

46
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,603
Thank you, Mr. Sanchez.

47
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:29,237
What issue exactly did the book
help you overcome?

48
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,543
The death of my mom.

49
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,449
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

50
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,286
I keep seeing her.

51
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:39,720
What do you mean by that?

52
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,985
I see her in all these different places.
I know that's not possible.

53
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:44,459
I know it's not true.

54
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:47,520
But I keep seeing her
in these different places.

55
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,190
Was she a good mother?

56
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,226
She was heaven.

57
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,198
Then she will be reborn.

58
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,031
And she's at peace.

59
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,736
It's her karma.

60
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,244
Thank you. Thank you.

61
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:13,514
<i>...showers and thunderstorms expected</i>
<i>to continue into tomorrow morning.</i>

62
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:18,494
<i>Rain tapering off tomorrow afternoon,</i>
<i>followed by partial clearing and a high of...</i>

63
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,501
What exactly is a praline?

64
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,615
It's good.

65
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,149
Your editor called.

66
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:44,648
I told him we can't do the on the road part
of the tour until after Memorial Day.

67
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:47,849
It's just weird, you know?

68
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,483
I mean what am I supposed to do?

69
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,994
Sign my signature and take pictures?

70
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,927
Don't do that.

71
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,556
People love meeting authors.

72
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,067
You're like a literary rock star.

73
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,635
Maybe you'll have some cute groupies.

74
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,899
I already have a cute groupie.

75
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,665
Yes, you do.

76
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,266
I'll throw my panties at you.

77
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,958
You left the window open.

78
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,858
It's okay, baby, it's just getting a breeze.

79
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:33,032
-I think I heard something.
-What?

80
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,298
You just heard the wind. It's okay.

81
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,527
-What's up, little brother?
-What the fuck!

82
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,158
-Jesus Christ!
-What up, punk!

83
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,531
What the fuck are you doing?

84
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:07,002
Man! What's up, man?
Just rode in on the bike, man.

85
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,732
Just come home from the county, baby.

86
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,604
You know I had to come and see you.
Getting that money now, baby.

87
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,334
You scared the hell out of me.

88
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,138
Don't I always?

89
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,712
What?

90
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,614
Where have you been?

91
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,778
Mom and Dad haven't talked to you
in almost a year.

92
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:27,585
They ain't exactly talking to me right now,
man, since I come home from the county.

93
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,285
You couldn't call nobody?

94
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,691
It's the middle of the night.

95
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,490
I got to call you? You're my brother.

96
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:33,962
Yeah.

97
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,226
Y'all are looking at me
like I’m a ghost or something.

98
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,494
It's me, baby.

99
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,497
You got a beer or something in there?

100
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,062
In the fridge.

101
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,637
Really?

102
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,041
I’m sorry.

103
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,209
He can't stay here.

104
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,475
I know. Just, all right...

105
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:53,175
-He can't stay here.
-Look. All right.

106
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,877
Let me talk to him.

107
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:00,919
Now meditation is very calming

108
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,721
if you stay quiet within yourself.

109
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,195
Close your eyes and breathe in through
your nose and out through your mouth.

110
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:08,788
Look, she can't do it.

111
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,264
This is weird. Why do people do this?

112
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,470
Think about it like looking into a mirror.

113
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,270
Okay? Now close your eyes.

114
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:21,003
Take a deep breath in through your nose

115
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:22,978
and out through your mouth.

116
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,844
Do you see your reflection?

117
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,851
Do you see your hair? See your smile?

118
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:32,511
And if you look really, really close,

119
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:35,353
you can see much more.

120
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:37,349
Excellent metaphor.

121
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,763
All right, guys.

122
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:42,729
That was a great class. Thank you.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,093
Good job!

124
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,696
Now who thinks she is
the bestest teacher in the world?

125
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,137
Raise your hands.

126
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,599
Who thinks our guest today
is a bit on the lame side?

127
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,676
Keep your hands up
if you still think she's beautiful.

128
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:02,976
Do you and Miss Carter kiss?

129
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,543
Hey!

130
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:08,216
Everyone say a big thank you to Mr. Carter
for speaking to us today.

131
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:09,554
Thank you.

132
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,652
And thank you guys for coming.
Give yourselves a round of applause.

133
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:15,259
Good job.

134
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,266
See you all next week.

135
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,328
Hey, you did a good job today.

136
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,502
What's your name?

137
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,867
Francesca Sanchez.

138
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:27,508
I’m eight.

139
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,237
Who is coming to pick you up,
your mom or your dad?

140
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:33,717
My mother and father
aren't together anymore.

141
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,287
I’m sorry.

142
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:41,189
Guess what I do for a living?

143
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,351
I’m a life coach.

144
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:46,055
That means I help adults
with their problems.

145
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:49,757
And a big part of my job is keeping secrets.

146
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,563
So if there is something you want to say,

147
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,264
I won't tell anybody.

148
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,468
Really?

149
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,201
Cross my heart and promise.

150
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:01,505
Francesca.

151
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:02,704
Let's go.

152
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,479
Hey, Dad.

153
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:15,081
-Hey. Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

154
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:39,076
What are you looking for?

155
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,053
Where's the coins
Granddaddy left for both of us?

156
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:45,413
Why?

157
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,514
Where's the fucking coins?

158
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,592
What happened?

159
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,790
I got beat the fuck up.
What it look like happened?

160
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,121
By who?

161
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,223
Just, where's the fucking coins at, man?

162
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,532
How much?

163
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,535
I need 12G's.

164
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,840
$12,000!

165
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,941
I got jumped on, man.

166
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,638
I was hanging out with Crystal

167
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,738
and some niggers from the Ninth Ward
jumped on me.

168
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,784
I’m gonna kill them bitches.
They some dead motherfuckers, man.

169
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,479
People were after you.

170
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,813
Why didn't you tell me?

171
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:21,356
I’m a grown-ass man, man.

172
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:26,362
They got a bounty on my head for 12K, bro.

173
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,625
I’ve been sleeping on park benches.

174
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,462
I’ve been sleeping in the trunks of cars.

175
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,398
I’ve been trying to survive, man.

176
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,332
'Cause they gonna kill a nigger, man.

177
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,201
I don't got $12,000.

178
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:38,202
You got a book deal.

179
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,207
That was an advance. That was nothing.

180
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,769
You owe me, man.

181
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,611
-What is that supposed to mean?
-You fucking owe me.

182
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,311
I read about your memoirs.

183
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:52,321
I read about your near death experiences.

184
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,586
And you left out one thing, Tommy baby.

185
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,723
I was there with you.

186
00:12:57,794 --> 00:12:59,591
I was with you.

187
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:05,226
That story was meant to illuminate
a changing point in my life.

188
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,031
That's bullshit, man. You lying.

189
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,535
You lying.

190
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,567
And the truth ain't in you.

191
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,437
But you ain't got to worry.

192
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,613
'Cause I ain't gonna tell your secret.

193
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,086
I’m gonna die with it, bro.

194
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:26,179
Got us a bottle of Barolo.
It's some fancy stuff.

195
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,383
Have a good night with your wife, man.

196
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,796
What was that?

197
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,329
Nothing.

198
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:41,893
What?

199
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,997
Don't worry about it. Hey.

200
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,548
<i>-Hello, Meyer.</i>
-Hello.

201
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:03,092
Mr. Meyer, hi.  It's Thomas Carter.

202
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:08,225
I was wondering...

203
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:10,960
I was wondering
if I could get some more money?

204
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,434
<i>I could add a couple more stops</i>
<i>on your book tour,</i>

205
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,902
<i>but you would have to leave this Friday.</i>

206
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,735
Okay. All right. Okay. All right.

207
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:18,866
<i>-How about Chicago?</i>
-Book it.

208
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,206
<i>Consider it done. See you Friday.</i>

209
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,075
Thank you, Mr. Meyer.

210
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,789
Hello?

211
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:28,404
What are you doing?

212
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:34,302
Looks like you hit a sewer pipe.

213
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:39,475
Me and my wife, my ex-wife,
we bought this place together.

214
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,848
But I just haven't been able
to bring myself to finish it up.

215
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,318
It's big.

216
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,150
You think about ever selling it?

217
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:49,454
I gotta finish it up
before I can put it on the market.

218
00:16:55,432 --> 00:17:00,199
I figure you're too busy
for a simple guy like me.

219
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:04,330
You say you don't do any
private sessions anymore, right?

220
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:08,844
It seems like you were in need,
so I figured I’d reach out to you.

221
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,241
How much lithium you taking?

222
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,084
Side effects are debilitating.

223
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,288
The ataxia must be affecting your work.

224
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,653
Blurred vision.

225
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,157
Lack of sleep.

226
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,185
Look, I saw my fair share
when I was a therapist.

227
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,457
Are you bipolar as well?

228
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,735
Don't worry about me.

229
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:39,274
I believe in confidentiality. I’m like a vault.

230
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:40,366
It's a struggle.

231
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,769
I’m not gonna lie, it's a struggle.

232
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,671
May I speak frankly with you?

233
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:48,946
I don't think renovations are keeping you
from selling this house.

234
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,050
You want your family home.

235
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:55,423
Your center.

236
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,085
You keep it dark on purpose. Right?

237
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:01,559
Your denial is so deep.

238
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,533
And you don't know why.

239
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,661
Can you help me?

240
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:11,668
Well, my rate's $300.  an hour.

241
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,473
And we can start today.

242
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:21,140
I’m gonna wash my hands up
and I’ll be back out.

243
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,380
All right.

244
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,626
You're self-conscious.

245
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:37,929
You're a man who does not like
to admit his faults.

246
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:42,766
But I want you to be pure with me, Angel.

247
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:48,437
Tell me your deepest, darkest thoughts.

248
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,713
Breathe.

249
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,990
Breathe. Take a deep breath.

250
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,564
Gautama Buddha,

251
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,198
in the mist of his meditation,

252
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:20,209
was assailed with doubt.

253
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:24,277
Christ on the cross said, "Father,

254
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,839
"why has thou forsaken me." Doubt.

255
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,577
Breathe and release your doubt

256
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:37,958
and feel the pulse of the trees.

257
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,528
It's good.

258
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,434
Listen to the earth, Angel.

259
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:51,941
Feel the pulse of the trees.

260
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:54,935
Good.

261
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:00,707
What was that?

262
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,547
You didn't see anything?

263
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,746
No. I’m sorry. Angel, now where were we?

264
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:07,483
We're done.

265
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,525
-Wait. What? Wait.
-You don't get it.

266
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,822
My thoughts are running
through my mind so fast,

267
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:14,022
it's like channels that just keep switching.

268
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,065
I can't just stop them
'cause you want them to relax.

269
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,100
It doesn't just go away
because you tell them to.

270
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,297
What happened to your mother?

271
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,332
What's that got to do with anything?

272
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,968
Angel, how did she die?

273
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,303
I can't do this with you.

274
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,574
-No, I can't do this.
-Angel.

275
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,913
Wait, no. Look, I have an idea.

276
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,986
Drugs don't cure pain, they just mask it.

277
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:45,118
I have an idea, but I need your mind
to be clear for it to work.

278
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:46,790
I can't do it.

279
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,057
Please.

280
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,461
Angel, please.

281
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:10,143
Thank you.

282
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,752
I trust you.

283
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,094
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, honey.</i>

284
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,730
<i>Just wondering where you're at.</i>

285
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:32,969
Yeah, I just had a business thing
I had to take care of.

286
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,706
<i>I've been trying to call you</i>
<i>and your phone kept going to voicemail.</i>

287
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,804
I don't...

288
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:39,975
Look, sweetie,

289
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:46,113
I took a wrong turn off the interstate
into the wetlands somewhere, so...

290
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,847
<i>Well, your dinner is cold,</i>
<i>but it's here when you get here.</i>

291
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,586
Okay. All right, okay.

292
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,025
-Love your face.
<i>-Love you, too.</i>

293
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:53,289
Bye.

294
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,006
What's wrong?

295
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:06,798
Who were you with?

296
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,339
I was with a new patient.

297
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,310
You working with clients again?

298
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:20,550
It's Angel Sanchez, Francesca's father.

299
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:25,724
I know you think it's a bad idea,
but it's something I have to do.

300
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:27,820
Don't ask. I just got to do it, okay?

301
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:30,025
Trust me.

302
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,630
I want Ben out the house.

303
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,297
Okay.

304
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:42,838
Okay. He's been on the couch for too long.

305
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:44,937
-I just want him out.
-Okay.

306
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,378
I’ll talk to him tomorrow.

307
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,657
What are you scared of, Angel?

308
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,461
I just don't see the point of being out here.

309
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,827
We must face your fears head on, Angel.

310
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:06,565
I’m not afraid of the water.
I’m not. I’m afraid of the river.

311
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:12,264
When was the last time you smiled?

312
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,536
I don't know.

313
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:26,214
Did I scare you?

314
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:29,691
Tell me, Angel.

315
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:35,359
Be honest, Angel.

316
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:37,595
Be verbal. Come on.

317
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,191
You don't want to know what I’m thinking.

318
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:44,830
Look, as ridiculous as it might seem,
just be honest!

319
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:52,538
It's a boat, Angel. Smile! Try smiling!

320
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:57,114
Look, I know the distress you feel.

321
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:00,979
Don't hold it in. Release it.
Toss it out, Angel.

322
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,150
Breathe, Angel. Yeah.

323
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:07,820
Breathe, Angel.

324
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,500
Breathe.

325
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:15,795
Are you mocking me?

326
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,600
What are we doing?

327
00:24:22,812 --> 00:24:26,179
They took my mom before her time.

328
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,245
I’m all fucked up.

329
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,314
I’m empty inside.

330
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,253
I didn't pay you to bring me out here.
I didn't pay you for no boat rides.

331
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,758
I paid you to get rid of my pain.

332
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:57,339
All right, Angel.

333
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:00,839
All right.

334
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,294
Which one is hers?

335
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,830
This one at the end. This one.

336
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,977
How do you feel, Angel?

337
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:37,885
You have to speak to your mother.

338
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,020
Talk to her. Open up.

339
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,391
Breathe, Angel.

340
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:51,226
Then what? These memories
are not just gonna go away just 'cause...

341
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,768
Repeat after me.

342
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:57,429
Talk to her.

343
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,610
Mom, I miss you.

344
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:08,046
Mom, I miss you.

345
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:10,918
I love you so much.

346
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,150
I love you so much.

347
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:19,183
I can't figure out a way to let you go.

348
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:23,389
I can't figure out a way to let you go.

349
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,627
And that is selfish of me.

350
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:33,973
Breathe, Angel.

351
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:35,032
I can't.

352
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:38,979
And that is selfish of me.

353
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:40,481
I can't.

354
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,315
I can't.

355
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:02,801
Angel, could you lead everyone in please?

356
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,569
We're here to invite AngeI’s mother in
one last time,

357
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:12,773
for one last visit,
then she will be free to move on.

358
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:14,476
Angel, sit there.

359
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:21,650
Those were her favorite.

360
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,918
Where do you want it?

361
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:24,425
-There is fine.
-Okay.

362
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,795
We've prepared this meal for nourishment,
for AngeI’s mother, for her journey home.

363
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,762
Daddy, I’m scared.

364
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:36,370
It's  okay,  Franny. I’m not gonna let
anything happen to you, okay?

365
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,973
Nothing is gonna happen, Francesca.

366
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:41,168
We're just here to help your daddy, okay?

367
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,407
-You know what? Jessica.
-Yes?

368
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,380
Can you take Francesca
into the kitchen with you?

369
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:48,212
-Sure.
-Thank you.

370
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:51,252
I don't know about all this.

371
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,550
The boy is just sad 'cause his mama passed.

372
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,447
This isn't as much a ritual

373
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:58,585
as it is a way to help Angel
let go of his mother.

374
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:01,721
I’m glad you said that
'cause this is a Christian house.

375
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:06,933
For the purposes we're here,
you can think of this as a therapy session.

376
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,238
I wanted AngeI’s relatives here because
you share the same blood as him.

377
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:14,834
There's not too much
you can't accomplish as a family.

378
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:19,075
And together you can pray
to your ancestors to guide AngeI’s mother.

379
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,580
And then we can rejoice
in her transformation.

380
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:24,584
For your ancestors.

381
00:28:24,654 --> 00:28:29,023
I give them fresh water to clear their path.

382
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:33,753
Angel, can you give me names of relatives
who have passed away?

383
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,024
My dad.

384
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,598
Fred Sanchez.

385
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,894
Uncle Charles.

386
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:40,766
My Aunt Jane.

387
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,635
-Maurice.
-My cousin. My cousin Edward.

388
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:46,173
Let's ask them

389
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:48,003
to meet your mother

390
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,347
and help her on her path

391
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,250
to heaven.

392
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,584
Shall we pray?

393
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:02,246
Do you have your wishes?

394
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,986
-Yeah.
-Put them in the fire.

395
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:08,225
Okay?

396
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,393
Come with me.

397
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:14,993
Sit here.

398
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:20,571
Angel, let's pray that your mother
moves into the next life.

399
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:26,271
With all your family here,
let's ask her to move on.

400
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,548
Let's pray

401
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,315
that she will go into the afterlife.

402
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,582
She leaves you

403
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:41,986
with nothing but her love.

404
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:47,261
You won't hold her here any longer.

405
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:50,772
All the sorrow is being washed away.

406
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,133
She's gone, Angel.

407
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,871
She's gone to continue her journey.

408
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:58,136
She's free.

409
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:03,717
That leaves you with nothing but her love.

410
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,916
Open your eyes.

411
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,633
Mama.

412
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:24,806
She's here.

413
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,835
She's still here.

414
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,877
You mean, you feel her presence?

415
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,774
No, no. She's standing.

416
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:35,515
She's standing right there.

417
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,643
Something's wrong with him.

418
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:38,376
There's nothing wrong with me.

419
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:40,684
I’m not sick. I’m not crazy.

420
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,615
She's here.

421
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:44,523
She's gone into the next life.

422
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:45,856
She's gone.

423
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:48,393
Get out! Go!

424
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:50,489
Go! Get out of the house!

425
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:52,090
Go!

426
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:55,228
Angel, I don't think you understand.

427
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,730
You gotta go.

428
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:03,373
-You gotta go.
-Okay.

429
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:04,936
You gotta go.

430
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:07,339
Get out.

431
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,154
Hey, here.

432
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:53,252
Fuck that. I’m cool.

433
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,627
It's cash. It'll get you out of it. Take it.

434
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:57,723
You think that little shit
you doing is something?

435
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,062
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

436
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,693
I rearranged my entire life for this.

437
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:05,034
I just came home from the pen, bro.
Working for 35 cents a day.

438
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:07,399
And I’ll go work for $5 an hour, man.

439
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,500
Fuck your money, bro.

440
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:10,408
What the hell are you talking about?

441
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,674
You said you were in trouble
and they were gonna hurt you.

442
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:17,046
I bought three weeks with them dudes, man.
Your money don't mean shit to me, bro.

443
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:18,852
You got a problem with me?

444
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:21,286
Yeah, you can't buy me.

445
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:23,821
I been knowing her. I introduced you to her.

446
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:26,453
She wasn't nothing
but a little old bartender.

447
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,827
You had the college degree,
you had the money.

448
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:29,922
You chose her.

449
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:32,797
And she chose you, over me, bro.

450
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:37,873
Now you acting all high and mighty
and fancy and all that.

451
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,034
'Cause you some kind of little therapist
and some shit like that.

452
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,874
And people think you're pure.
But, nigger, I know you.

453
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:48,649
You ain't shit, nigger.

454
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:52,879
Go look in the fucking mirror.

455
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,258
Oh, yeah, here's your cut
of Granddaddy's coin collection.

456
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:18,379
You were giving him money?

457
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,241
Is Ben the reason
you started taking clients again?

458
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:28,487
The father of that girl
in my yoga class, for him?

459
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,988
My brother's gone. I hope you're happy.

460
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,927
I got to go pack for my trip.

461
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:36,430
Tommy?

462
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:16,329
Are you serious?

463
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,270
You came.

464
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:57,344
I made us some dinner.

465
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:00,039
What do you think of the place?

466
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:01,649
-Nice.
-It's nice, right?

467
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:03,446
Yeah. It's nice.

468
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,316
It's been so energized ever since your visit.

469
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:07,548
I was cleaning.
I’ve been cleaning all day long.

470
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:08,647
I feel so good.

471
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:14,060
Listen, Angel,
I’m afraid I can't continue our sessions.

472
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,928
But I paid you already.

473
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:20,493
Full refund.

474
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,130
I don't understand.

475
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,968
I wanted to tell you in person.

476
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:30,905
I’m leaving town.

477
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:33,949
-For how long?
-A few weeks.

478
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,041
That's fine. A couple weeks is nothing.

479
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:37,642
But I think you still

480
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,517
should speak with someone.

481
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:41,613
Just to help you keep that balance.

482
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:43,452
You know?

483
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,222
So I wrote down some of my colleagues'
names and numbers for you.

484
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,994
For you to contact.

485
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:55,966
You don't understand.

486
00:35:56,038 --> 00:35:57,801
See, my little girl is coming over

487
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,841
and my wife, Sophie, she's coming with her.

488
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,707
I was thinking that you could meet her
and you would be able to tell her

489
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:05,713
that I’m getting better
and that you've worked it out.

490
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,305
That we've worked it out,
that you've fixed things.

491
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:08,543
Angel.

492
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:09,811
Fixed.

493
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,515
Another time.

494
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,453
How about you just stay for a drink?

495
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:15,649
Just a drink?

496
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,589
I can't. Thank you.

497
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,153
I understand.

498
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,063
You got important places to be.

499
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,324
I don't mean to bother you.

500
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:28,493
Thanks for coming in the first place.

501
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:34,168
One last hug?

502
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:39,646
Well, I hope that your journey

503
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:42,275
brings you to where you need to go.

504
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:45,510
You, too.

505
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:57,088
She says you can't leave.

506
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,366
What is this?

507
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,099
Angel?

508
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,639
Where am I?

509
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,842
Angel!

510
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,946
Angel!

511
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:53,521
Angel.

512
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:55,785
Answer me.

513
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,152
You hear me?

514
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,198
What are you doing?

515
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:05,563
Angel. No. No.

516
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:20,379
Angel!

517
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,983
Angel!

518
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,852
Franny, stay up there.

519
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:33,918
What are you doing down there?

520
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,055
Stay up there. All right?

521
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:38,326
I had a bad dream.

522
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:42,995
Okay. I’ll come up, all right?

523
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,300
I’ll be right there.

524
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:46,870
Close that door for me, all right?

525
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:54,810
Angel, look, why am I...

526
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:57,647
Why am I here? What are you doing?

527
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,414
Where am I?

528
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,948
All right. Listen carefully, okay?

529
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:04,652
I’ve been gone a whole night, all right?

530
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:07,490
Sooner or later my wife is gonna
figure out something is wrong. Right?

531
00:39:07,563 --> 00:39:09,690
You know what she's gonna do?
She's gonna call the police.

532
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,198
And you know what that means? Cops.

533
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,598
They're gonna come here,
they're gonna see what you're doing to me,

534
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,432
and they are gonna arrest you.

535
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:19,133
Angel, everybody,
your whole family, your wife,

536
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,573
everybody's gonna be heartbroken.

537
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:22,132
You're never gonna see
your daughter again.

538
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:23,838
Is that what you want, Angel?

539
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,641
-Is that what you want?
-Have some cleanser.

540
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,981
Keep your mouth closed.
Keep your mouth closed.

541
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,453
Keep your mouth closed.

542
00:39:36,892 --> 00:39:38,826
Cleanse away your soul.

543
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:49,594
How long do you think
you can keep me here?

544
00:39:52,174 --> 00:39:53,801
You made this up, not me.

545
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,807
Help!

546
00:39:58,213 --> 00:40:00,238
Help!

547
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,341
Can anybody hear me?

548
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:08,656
Can anybody hear me?

549
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:12,556
Can anybody hear me?

550
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,926
Can anybody hear me?

551
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:23,660
You know, the people
who designed this house,

552
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:27,507
they're quacks.

553
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,606
It's a bomb shelter.

554
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:35,140
You remember when people used to be,
like, afraid of the Russians?

555
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:39,743
It sounds crazy now,
but remember, Russians?

556
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:43,689
Is anybody out there? Help!

557
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:46,091
Can you hear me?

558
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,195
Maybe you should yell to Mr. Yang.

559
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,902
Mr. Yang!

560
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:58,067
Mr. Yang!

561
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,438
That's my neighbors.
They live right next door.

562
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,937
They're not here right now, though.
They had to go to their son's graduation.

563
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:08,312
I sent them... I sent them a card.

564
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,645
Angel,

565
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,410
let me go.

566
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:16,681
I can't.

567
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,386
Want to tell me what you're feeling?

568
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,992
Why?

569
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:25,625
Because this lack of reason
is not you, Angel.

570
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:29,535
It comes from a place of confusion inside.

571
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:32,199
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

572
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:35,607
This state of mind is strong.

573
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:37,542
It's toxic.

574
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:39,804
Makes you feel like you've split.

575
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:43,408
One side is making the other side

576
00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:46,386
question your basic humanity.

577
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:49,955
Right? But look, don't blame yourself.

578
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:53,288
Don't blame yourself. It's not you. Okay?

579
00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:54,624
Look at me.

580
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:56,690
Look at me.

581
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:59,564
I’m not crazy!

582
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:02,961
Then why am I tied up, Angel?

583
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,368
To tell the truth.

584
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,134
It's that simple.

585
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:13,138
You can trust me. I value privacy.

586
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:14,341
I’m like a vault.

587
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:18,581
Tell me all your secrets

588
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:23,091
and I’ll let you go.

589
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:30,965
Who taught you that?

590
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,094
I got to see this through.

591
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,193
You got to see what through?

592
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:39,670
Look, our decisions make our paths.

593
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,969
Don't make bad decisions.

594
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:43,170
Angel, look,

595
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:46,214
think about what this will mean
in your next life.

596
00:42:46,615 --> 00:42:50,449
You are so smooth.
Do you know that? You are so smooth.

597
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:53,215
Do you even believe the things
that you say? Do you believe them?

598
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:55,847
You didn't want to be alone. I get that.

599
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:58,751
But this isn't the correct way
to handle this, Angel.

600
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:03,464
You think this is because I’m lonely?
Is that what you think?

601
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:10,167
You'd rather believe that
there's something wrong with me.

602
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:14,700
You think that I’m losing my mind,
that I can't think straight.

603
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:18,177
I was mistaken. I’m sorry.
I was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

604
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,906
I’m not gonna let you infect my ideas.

605
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,644
I’m not gonna let you get inside of my mind.

606
00:43:26,455 --> 00:43:27,513
Wake up!

607
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:28,817
Wake up!

608
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,448
Wake up, Tommy!

609
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:33,119
Are you ready?

610
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,890
No, Angel. Angel, don't.

611
00:43:34,963 --> 00:43:36,487
Whatever you're thinking, don't do it, Angel.

612
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:39,534
I was just trying to help, Angel.
I was just trying to help.

613
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,567
I’m sorry!

614
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:54,277
Bring forth that which is within you.

615
00:43:55,283 --> 00:43:58,184
That which is within you, will save you.

616
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,802
Hello?

617
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:22,605
Maggie, it's Meyer. Where's Tommy?

618
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:24,871
Isn't he with you?

619
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:27,506
No, no, no, he flew off alone.
I’m supposed to meet him later.

620
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,174
He missed his book signing.

621
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:31,449
-What?
<i>-Yes.</i>

622
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,579
Are you sure he has his dates right?
Have you heard from him?

623
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:38,682
-I got a text from him, he said he was okay.
<i>-Well, just sit tight. We'll track him down.</i>

624
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,990
Have him call me
when he gets to Chicago. Good?

625
00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:42,861
Yeah, I will.

626
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:55,572
I have a confession.

627
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,345
This house used to be happy.

628
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:05,483
Once.

629
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,201
Water.

630
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:32,903
I need water.

631
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:38,014
You know, I read this, you know.

632
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:43,523
It opened something in me
that I thought was lost.

633
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:47,694
How to channel optimism.

634
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,630
How to channel optimism.

635
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:51,793
I can't feel anything.

636
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:53,698
To be optimistic.

637
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:54,792
It says here,

638
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:59,898
"If we aren't positive,
it will show and we will flounder."

639
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:03,806
"Flounder." That's a great word.

640
00:46:03,879 --> 00:46:06,177
Why are you keeping me here, huh?

641
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:10,642
Are you ready to embrace your words?

642
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:13,688
What do you want?

643
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:17,991
Are you ready to go
on a journey of healing with me?

644
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,060
There's stages. There's stages.
There's steps in your book.

645
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,160
Let's start at the beginning.

646
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:30,760
Down the road of virtue.

647
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:36,470
You know, a person can't be at peace

648
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:40,004
if they have negative attitudes.

649
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,710
Optimism. That's what I want from you.

650
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:49,917
I want you to turn that frown upside down.

651
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,618
Sometimes I failed, it couldn't always work.

652
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:54,924
But I’m telling you, if you just smile,

653
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:59,057
just smile, doesn't mean you feel it,
something will change.

654
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:02,162
Smile!

655
00:47:04,606 --> 00:47:06,005
Smile!

656
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:07,969
Smile!

657
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,938
Just smile! You know what?
I don't need this.

658
00:47:13,548 --> 00:47:16,073
I don't have time for this shit!

659
00:47:16,151 --> 00:47:18,051
When you're ready, I’ll be back.

660
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,110
I’ll be back in a few hours.
Maybe you'll think about it then.

661
00:47:20,188 --> 00:47:21,780
No. Angel. No.

662
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:26,388
You're serious.

663
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:28,461
I’m waiting.

664
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:30,688
Smile.

665
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,662
Watch me.

666
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,071
Do a little Snoopy dance.

667
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:43,335
Smile.

668
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:48,041
You're faking it!

669
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,621
It's very strong.

670
00:47:58,393 --> 00:47:59,883
Hydromorphone.

671
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:02,854
lt works.

672
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,862
You didn't even wake up
when I pushed that through your leg.

673
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,510
-Angel.
-You don't even feel any pain.

674
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:19,478
You will feel pain.

675
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:21,773
Please, look, I need a hospital.

676
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:25,581
This book right here, your book, it says,

677
00:48:26,087 --> 00:48:28,555
you are committed

678
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:33,424
to help individuals find their path.

679
00:48:34,529 --> 00:48:36,019
Individuals.

680
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:39,258
What do I look like to you?

681
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:42,294
You just abandoned me!

682
00:48:43,104 --> 00:48:46,369
What are you... Look, I wrote the book
to help people find a better life.

683
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:47,908
That's what I do!

684
00:48:47,976 --> 00:48:50,274
I know what I’m talking about. All right?

685
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:54,611
Call Dillard and ask them
what my two graduate degrees are in.

686
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:56,683
Clinical Studies.

687
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:59,345
And the second is in Theology.

688
00:48:59,421 --> 00:49:01,981
It's better for my patients if I know both.

689
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:10,026
You're making this very hard on yourself.

690
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:16,964
Only the truth

691
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:19,898
will set you free.

692
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,378
No. Angel.

693
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:26,107
I need a hospital.

694
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,940
Angel! No!

695
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:03,883
<i>It's Tommy. Leave a message.</i>

696
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:05,178
Hey, it's me.

697
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,247
I need to talk to you.

698
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:10,120
Call me back please.

699
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:22,527
What?

700
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,902
Angel, please. Give me a shot.

701
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:34,473
I want you, when I uncover your eyes,
to see the world anew.

702
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:42,083
The good, the bad, skillful deeds.

703
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:48,053
See it in the mind.

704
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,987
Only then,

705
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:53,056
can you see who you really are.

706
00:50:56,604 --> 00:50:58,697
These are your words.

707
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:01,775
Is that the lesson?

708
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:12,684
You wrote, "The first truth
shows the presence

709
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:14,582
"of suffering.

710
00:51:15,356 --> 00:51:21,818
"The second truth seeks
to determine the source

711
00:51:22,897 --> 00:51:24,364
"of suffering."

712
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:29,261
No. No.

713
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,066
Oh, my God, Angel. No, please.

714
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:32,163
God, no! Okay.

715
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,333
Okay, I killed a cat.

716
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:37,537
I killed a cat. I killed a cat.

717
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:39,306
Go on.

718
00:51:39,781 --> 00:51:42,682
I killed my mom's cat in third grade.

719
00:51:44,052 --> 00:51:46,782
I wanted to see if it was true
if a cat had nine lives or not.

720
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:50,120
So I took my mom's cat in the garage
and I choked it.

721
00:51:51,893 --> 00:51:55,556
It took a long time for it to die
and it scratched the shit out of me.

722
00:51:57,098 --> 00:52:01,592
My mom found the cat in the trash
and she was crushed.

723
00:52:01,669 --> 00:52:02,795
My dad wanted to beat me,

724
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:06,238
but my big brother Ben stepped in
and took the blame.

725
00:52:09,844 --> 00:52:12,836
He's been a bad guy
and I’ve been a good guy ever since.

726
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:14,509
I see.

727
00:52:15,683 --> 00:52:17,116
Worst thing that you've ever done?

728
00:52:17,185 --> 00:52:18,777
Yes.

729
00:52:19,354 --> 00:52:20,651
I swear to God.

730
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:22,787
Why did you work with me?

731
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,159
I mean, you said before that
you weren't taking any new clients,

732
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,718
but you sought me out,
you were looking for me.

733
00:52:28,796 --> 00:52:31,560
Money. My brother needed the money.

734
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:33,533
Were you just using me?

735
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:38,163
Yes. Now could you please
let me out of here? Please?

736
00:52:38,273 --> 00:52:41,265
You could die right here in this place

737
00:52:42,343 --> 00:52:44,937
in a peaceful way or a painful way.

738
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:46,608
If you keep lying,

739
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,077
you're gonna live to regret it.

740
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,682
It's your phone.

741
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:01,252
Hey. It's your wife.

742
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:02,421
Don't you talk to her.

743
00:53:03,064 --> 00:53:04,429
Don't.

744
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,094
Don't talk to her.

745
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,200
That's for the cat.

746
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,437
Hey.

747
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:25,739
You want me to read you
a spooky ghost story?

748
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,913
Not tonight.

749
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:47,261
Hey, there's something
talking to me from down there.

750
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:49,530
-That was you.
-It was not me.

751
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:50,832
I’m telling you.

752
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,571
He's down there talking to me.

753
00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:08,952
There's monsters in the basement.

754
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:11,889
No!

755
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:14,325
For real. There are really scary monsters...

756
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:42,217
I’m gonna take Leonard with me.
We're gonna go downstairs.

757
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,521
We're gonna take care
of those nasty monsters.

758
00:55:46,394 --> 00:55:47,452
Love you.

759
00:56:57,565 --> 00:56:59,032
Don't die.

760
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:27,227
Good job, Cathy.

761
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:30,430
Try a little tighter. A little tighter.

762
00:57:30,498 --> 00:57:31,760
Good girl.

763
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:43,405
Excuse me. Is this Karma Kids Yoga?

764
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,034
-Yeah.
-Hi.

765
00:57:45,112 --> 00:57:46,943
I’m here to pick up my daughter Francesca.

766
00:57:48,115 --> 00:57:51,016
-She didn't make it today.
-What?

767
00:57:51,285 --> 00:57:53,515
Her father was supposed
to bring her to class.

768
00:57:53,588 --> 00:57:55,920
Well, schedules can sneak up on you.
It happens all the time.

769
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,754
No. Her father always sticks to the schedule.

770
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:00,191
You want to use my cell?

771
00:58:00,261 --> 00:58:03,958
No. You know what? He lives right nearby.
I can just stop over there.

772
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:06,625
My husband, Tommy Carter,
he's been working with Angel.

773
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,066
Is he in construction, too?

774
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:11,370
No, he's a life coach.

775
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:13,930
-They were in sessions last week.
-Oh, no.

776
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:17,307
I doubt that.
Angel doesn't really open up to people.

777
00:58:18,546 --> 00:58:20,343
I really gotta go find her.

778
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:22,175
Thank you!

779
00:58:38,466 --> 00:58:39,524
Fuck.

780
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:44,136
You were in her room.

781
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:47,464
The next stage

782
00:58:49,744 --> 00:58:51,268
is acceptance.

783
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:53,438
Acceptance of who we are.

784
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:56,513
Acceptance of our situation.

785
00:58:57,351 --> 00:58:58,841
Acceptance of what we become.

786
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,018
Rules!

787
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:07,524
You come clean and it will stop.

788
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,191
Okay. All right.

789
00:59:10,264 --> 00:59:11,993
Okay.

790
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,008
My brother was in love with a girl

791
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:24,408
who worked at Chantilly Lane, a bar.

792
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:27,179
A bar uptown.

793
00:59:28,182 --> 00:59:30,412
He used to make me go with him

794
00:59:31,252 --> 00:59:33,686
just so he could see her smile.

795
00:59:33,754 --> 00:59:36,484
He said her smile used to melt him.

796
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:45,597
I talked to her
and made her go out on a date with him.

797
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,562
But the two of them didn't work out.

798
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:55,437
-When he got arrested...
-Yeah.

799
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:01,412
...I went back to that bar

800
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:07,517
and her smile melted me, too.

801
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:15,623
I never visited him in prison
because I felt so bad.

802
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:19,555
I felt wrong.

803
01:00:21,669 --> 01:00:22,795
Yeah.

804
01:00:24,105 --> 01:00:25,504
Angel,

805
01:00:27,908 --> 01:00:30,035
why are you keeping me here?

806
01:00:42,423 --> 01:00:43,617
Don't.

807
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:45,825
Angel?

808
01:00:46,994 --> 01:00:48,393
Help!

809
01:00:48,462 --> 01:00:49,656
Help!

810
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,459
-Don't make a sound.
-Help me!

811
01:00:51,532 --> 01:00:54,092
-Help! Somebody help me!
-Shut up!

812
01:01:08,682 --> 01:01:10,445
Angel, open up. It's me.

813
01:01:16,023 --> 01:01:17,923
Okay, she was supposed to be at yoga.

814
01:01:17,992 --> 01:01:20,290
You cannot just switch up the plans
on me without telling me.

815
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:22,261
She didn't want to go.
I didn't want to make her.

816
01:01:22,797 --> 01:01:25,561
It's because she doesn't want to take yoga.
She wants to take ballet.

817
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:27,157
You're the one who pushed her to take yoga.

818
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:29,099
-Sophie.
-Where is she?

819
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:30,762
She's fine. Okay.

820
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:34,467
She's fine. She's upstairs,
she's doing her homework. I got this.

821
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:37,737
What's all this? Is this blood?

822
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:43,441
Wow. Yeah. I guess so. I...

823
01:01:43,517 --> 01:01:46,918
I’ve been working so hard, I probably
nicked myself, I didn't even realize it.

824
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:49,080
It's nothing. It's nothing.

825
01:01:50,024 --> 01:01:51,787
Okay, you need to start
being honest with me.

826
01:01:53,227 --> 01:01:54,956
Look, I cannot risk leaving her here if you...

827
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,360
Hey, Mom.

828
01:01:57,665 --> 01:01:58,791
Hi, baby.

829
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:02,536
-Sweetie, you okay?
-Yes.

830
01:02:06,674 --> 01:02:09,973
Daddy, can you please help me
clean Leonard's bowl?

831
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:17,314
Sophie, please don't make her think
there's something wrong with me.

832
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:18,373
I can't take that.

833
01:02:18,452 --> 01:02:20,784
Don't do it. Don't. Don't.

834
01:02:20,855 --> 01:02:22,880
Don't let her think that.

835
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,323
Daddy, you coming?

836
01:02:25,392 --> 01:02:26,950
Daddy, will be right in, baby.

837
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,325
Thank you. Thank you.

838
01:02:30,397 --> 01:02:31,455
Thank you.

839
01:02:31,532 --> 01:02:32,624
Take your pills.

840
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:36,327
Let me walk you to your car, all right?

841
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:40,736
Hey, what did you do with all that
horrible plastic you had everywhere?

842
01:02:42,643 --> 01:02:45,544
I... Let me move this.

843
01:02:45,613 --> 01:02:47,808
I took it down
and I wrapped up some garbage

844
01:02:47,882 --> 01:02:49,907
and threw it in the basement.

845
01:02:50,985 --> 01:02:53,613
You know, you should fix this place up.

846
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,545
Try to sell it. Get a fresh start, you know.

847
01:02:55,623 --> 01:02:59,889
I mean, there's just too much stuff that
needs to be fixed up right now. I mean...

848
01:03:00,928 --> 01:03:02,828
Hey. Hey. Hey.

849
01:03:03,898 --> 01:03:05,422
-Sorry.
-Close your eyes.

850
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:08,024
-Okay.
-Close your eyes. Okay?

851
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:09,895
Yeah.

852
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:12,097
Now remember your mama taught me this.

853
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,538
She said,

854
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:18,842
"Wipe the trouble away.

855
01:03:18,913 --> 01:03:20,642
"Let the beauty in.

856
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:24,274
"Wipe the trouble away.

857
01:03:26,253 --> 01:03:27,515
"Let the beauty in."

858
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:39,858
Angel, don't go back to that dark place.
You hear me?

859
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:42,491
I...

860
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:46,871
I’ve been having sessions
with this guy and...

861
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:49,000
-Really?
-Yeah, I’ve been working on

862
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:51,176
getting past my issues.

863
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:52,542
He's been helping me channel all that.

864
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:55,405
-Really?
-Yeah, it's working.

865
01:03:55,482 --> 01:03:58,576
I never would have thought you...
That's great.

866
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,085
Just say you'll come home.

867
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:07,994
I can't.

868
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,122
Soon, right?

869
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,064
I...

870
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,627
I’m done with the living room.

871
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:21,597
And I’ve been trying to finish those cabinets

872
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:24,200
in the kitchen that you always wanted.

873
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:28,009
Trying to make it really, really special.

874
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:30,539
Beautiful.

875
01:04:31,185 --> 01:04:32,675
Perfect for you.

876
01:04:33,253 --> 01:04:34,845
I know you are.

877
01:04:38,258 --> 01:04:43,457
Why don't you try to make it
beautiful for you?

878
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:49,462
I can't make it beautiful for me
if you're not there.

879
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,363
Please, I can't...

880
01:04:52,439 --> 01:04:54,703
-I can't make it perfect unless you're there.
-Angel. Angel. Angel.

881
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:56,936
It doesn't work like that. I need you.

882
01:04:57,011 --> 01:04:59,605
-Angel.
-I need you.

883
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:02,006
I’ll call you later, okay?

884
01:05:02,082 --> 01:05:03,549
I love you.

885
01:05:38,452 --> 01:05:39,476
Hello?

886
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:53,193
Hey, if you can hear me, call the police.
Hello!

887
01:05:56,603 --> 01:05:58,798
Hey. What are you doing?

888
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:02,433
Daddy! Listen, listen,
there's monsters in the drain.

889
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:06,368
You ready to go?

890
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:07,675
Come on.

891
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:10,140
Thank you. Let's go.

892
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,125
If you can hear me, call the police.

893
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:31,667
Your mama was an amazing woman.

894
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,867
I’m so sorry.

895
01:06:36,543 --> 01:06:40,240
You know, Sophie, I’m sorry.
I just need a little space, okay?

896
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:43,148
I just need a little space. I’m sorry.

897
01:06:43,217 --> 01:06:44,650
You need to take your pills, baby.

898
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:45,946
Take your pills.

899
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:47,316
Some space.

900
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:34,529
So, this is where you work?

901
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:39,197
Yeah. Beats living in the streets.
What's happening?

902
01:07:40,407 --> 01:07:42,602
Have you talked to Tommy?

903
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,775
No, I ain't talked to him.

904
01:07:45,345 --> 01:07:48,837
I haven't heard from him.
I’ve been calling him.

905
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:52,511
This isn't like him.
His editor doesn't even know where he is.

906
01:07:53,187 --> 01:07:57,487
You know, Tommy made his own bed, sis.
He got to lay in it.

907
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,588
Why do you hate him?

908
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,490
What, you thought it was gonna be roses?

909
01:08:03,564 --> 01:08:05,896
You thought I was gonna be happy
'cause you and him was together?

910
01:08:05,966 --> 01:08:08,059
Look, Maggie, you see me in here
working these little odd jobs.

911
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:09,500
I’m trying to do the right thing.

912
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:12,038
I’m trying to show you
that I can play in the same lane.

913
01:08:12,105 --> 01:08:15,131
Why? I love Tommy. I love him.

914
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:18,110
And when I find him,
I’m gonna tell him I love him.

915
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:30,753
Why don't you just kill me?

916
01:08:32,059 --> 01:08:35,927
Certain actions bring upon oneself

917
01:08:36,864 --> 01:08:39,162
certain inevitable reactions.

918
01:08:39,233 --> 01:08:42,202
You're not misinterpreting my book.

919
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:44,362
You're just bat shit crazy.

920
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:49,832
You ever heard of

921
01:08:51,645 --> 01:08:56,378
a man named António Egas Moniz?

922
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,486
He won the Nobel prize.

923
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:07,019
Over. For a procedure that cured the brain.

924
01:09:14,034 --> 01:09:15,058
Lobotomy.

925
01:09:15,435 --> 01:09:17,232
Angel, you can't do this.

926
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:20,366
Sophie, everybody's gonna be heartbroken.

927
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,876
You'll never ever see your daughter again.
Is that what you want?

928
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:28,546
You know.

929
01:09:44,197 --> 01:09:47,325
"It's better to light a candle
than curse the darkness."

930
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:53,630
"It's better to light a candle
than to curse the darkness."

931
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:56,134
Why did you write that quote?

932
01:09:56,743 --> 01:10:01,180
A psychic quoted to you a line I said
and because of that it's my fault?

933
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:02,875
I’ve never even seen your mother.

934
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:04,040
You're lying.

935
01:10:08,989 --> 01:10:10,354
I’m telling the truth.

936
01:10:10,424 --> 01:10:12,892
My near death experience
was a car accident.

937
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,554
I swear. Ask my brother. He was there.

938
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,497
No!

939
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:21,992
It can't be true. It's not true.

940
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,897
I don't even know what the bayou looks like.

941
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,369
-You're lying.
-Look at me.

942
01:10:28,442 --> 01:10:30,808
-I’m not lying to you.
-No.

943
01:10:30,877 --> 01:10:34,608
I know the pain you must be feeling,

944
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:36,774
but no matter how much you torture me,

945
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,545
it won't bring her back.

946
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:44,715
Her death is the effect and you are cause.
It has to be.

947
01:10:45,092 --> 01:10:46,582
Let me help you.

948
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,685
Untie me. You got the wrong guy.

949
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,194
No, no, no, no, no, no.

950
01:10:50,263 --> 01:10:54,427
Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm.

951
01:10:59,873 --> 01:11:01,602
"Don't look back."

952
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:05,401
What's that supposed to mean?

953
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,117
Do you do one-on-one sessions?

954
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:18,624
If you change your mind,
I could pay your fee.

955
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:23,626
No! The signs all pointed to you!

956
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:27,127
You're seeing connection
where there is only coincidence.

957
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,430
There is no such thing as coincidence.

958
01:11:29,503 --> 01:11:31,630
That's in your book.
You wrote it in your book.

959
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:33,332
Angel, you don't believe that.

960
01:11:47,254 --> 01:11:52,817
In my heart, I believe that you're guilty.

961
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:56,226
You're guilty.

962
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:00,894
That weight, it just rots you to the bone.

963
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:04,359
It's a cancer.

964
01:12:06,206 --> 01:12:09,835
And that is why I’m being haunted.

965
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,348
I’m sorry for what I’m about to do.

966
01:12:16,516 --> 01:12:18,347
You gave me no choice.

967
01:12:23,356 --> 01:12:26,154
Angel. Angel.

968
01:12:26,226 --> 01:12:27,523
Wait.

969
01:12:31,998 --> 01:12:33,329
Thank you. I’ll see you next week.

970
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,300
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

971
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:28,988
Olly olly oxen free, you can't find me.

972
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:33,419
Franny.

973
01:13:34,761 --> 01:13:36,194
Franny.

974
01:13:36,263 --> 01:13:38,823
Franny, I don't have time for this.
I can't play with you right now. Okay?

975
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:41,527
Olly olly oxen free, you can't find me.

976
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:44,332
Franny.

977
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:46,895
I need you to come out. Come out right now.

978
01:14:14,935 --> 01:14:18,837
Franny. Franny. Come out right now.
I don't have time for this.

979
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,429
Franny!

980
01:14:21,508 --> 01:14:23,169
You can't find me.

981
01:14:33,987 --> 01:14:35,511
Gotcha!

982
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:42,326
You know what? I almost didn't find you.
You're getting too good for me.

983
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:45,455
I was gonna hide in the basement,
but it was locked.

984
01:14:45,532 --> 01:14:48,228
Well, you know, you promised that
you'd stay up there till I came to get you.

985
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:52,533
-You remember that, right?
-I did. I just came down to surprise you.

986
01:14:52,606 --> 01:14:54,096
Yeah, you surprised me.

987
01:14:54,174 --> 01:14:56,904
All right, Franny.
Stay in here and get some rest, okay.

988
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:48,520
Maggie's here.

989
01:15:49,496 --> 01:15:50,986
She's upstairs.

990
01:17:52,685 --> 01:17:53,777
Ben's here.

991
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:19,638
<i>It's Tommy. Leave a message.</i>

992
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:23,405
Yo, bro, I’m here at this place
you told me to come to.

993
01:18:23,483 --> 01:18:26,384
They got boards
all over the fucking windows.

994
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:30,414
Call me back.
I’m going to stick around for a few.

995
01:19:55,775 --> 01:19:57,333
Help me.

996
01:19:58,378 --> 01:19:59,902
Help me.

997
01:20:03,816 --> 01:20:05,374
Help me.

998
01:20:09,956 --> 01:20:11,617
Help.

999
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:27,172
Help me.

1000
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,605
Maggie?

1001
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:36,346
Baby.

1002
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:37,978
Are you okay?

1003
01:20:38,051 --> 01:20:40,110
What did he do to you?

1004
01:20:54,968 --> 01:20:56,959
Don't worry. Almost done.

1005
01:21:21,561 --> 01:21:23,654
You still got some fight in you huh?

1006
01:21:34,874 --> 01:21:40,039
I wanted to bring Tommy's family here
because you share the same blood as him.

1007
01:21:40,113 --> 01:21:44,174
And as you know there is not too much
a family can't accomplish together.

1008
01:21:44,751 --> 01:21:46,480
Even telling the truth.

1009
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,752
Right now, what are you thinking?

1010
01:21:50,623 --> 01:21:52,284
This is about me, right?

1011
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,385
I’m not talking to you, Tommy.

1012
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:58,754
I’m talking to her.

1013
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:01,593
I’m talking to her.

1014
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:08,700
Do you love him?

1015
01:22:16,816 --> 01:22:18,340
Yes, very much.

1016
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:25,414
Do you believe in the things he says?

1017
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,387
Things that he teaches?

1018
01:22:32,732 --> 01:22:34,825
Is he an honest man? That's the question.

1019
01:22:38,337 --> 01:22:41,602
Yes. He's a very honest man.

1020
01:22:43,676 --> 01:22:45,439
You know, here's the thing.

1021
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:49,344
You are all about to die.

1022
01:22:50,283 --> 01:22:51,910
That's a fact. That's going to happen.

1023
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:55,720
The question is
do you want to die with regrets?

1024
01:23:00,126 --> 01:23:04,756
Ben, is there something you want to share
with the group before you die?

1025
01:23:14,841 --> 01:23:17,002
You don't know what the fuck
I’ve done for you.

1026
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:19,801
You fucked my life up, man.

1027
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,675
I’m always covering for your ass.

1028
01:23:24,617 --> 01:23:27,609
I’m always looking out for Tommy's ass
ever since we was kids.

1029
01:23:31,657 --> 01:23:34,922
We was both tanked that night.
We was both drunk as fuck.

1030
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:43,258
Hey, hey, hey.

1031
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:45,198
Stop putting your hands up.

1032
01:23:46,873 --> 01:23:48,431
Wait. Wait. Look here.

1033
01:23:49,008 --> 01:23:50,566
This is a bridge.

1034
01:24:01,888 --> 01:24:04,254
God damn.

1035
01:24:04,323 --> 01:24:06,348
What the fuck, man.

1036
01:24:06,425 --> 01:24:07,687
Damn.

1037
01:24:08,094 --> 01:24:09,618
Man.

1038
01:24:09,695 --> 01:24:11,595
Come on, man. Wake up, bro.

1039
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:13,525
Tommy, we hit somebody.

1040
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:17,696
Damn. Come on.

1041
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:19,067
Tommy.

1042
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:20,704
Shit.

1043
01:24:20,773 --> 01:24:22,104
Come on, man.

1044
01:24:22,175 --> 01:24:23,506
Come on, man.

1045
01:24:26,946 --> 01:24:28,243
Just stay right there, bro.

1046
01:24:35,788 --> 01:24:39,121
My mother died in agony.
That's what you're telling me?

1047
01:24:39,192 --> 01:24:42,650
Angel, I am so sorry.

1048
01:24:44,197 --> 01:24:46,392
No, you're not. You're still holding back.

1049
01:24:46,465 --> 01:24:48,865
-That's right.
-You're holding back.

1050
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:51,165
There's more to that story.

1051
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:54,439
I heard her voice.

1052
01:24:57,577 --> 01:24:59,511
I was so scared.

1053
01:25:10,323 --> 01:25:12,314
Help me.

1054
01:25:15,294 --> 01:25:17,285
Help me.

1055
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:19,126
Help me.

1056
01:25:35,114 --> 01:25:36,604
Ben.

1057
01:25:37,984 --> 01:25:39,975
Where are you going?

1058
01:25:51,497 --> 01:25:55,524
The weeks went by
and they never found her.

1059
01:25:59,105 --> 01:26:00,697
And it was history.

1060
01:26:00,773 --> 01:26:02,138
Tommy?

1061
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,403
Tommy, baby, tell me that's not true.

1062
01:26:05,444 --> 01:26:06,911
Tell me.

1063
01:26:10,983 --> 01:26:12,143
I knew...

1064
01:26:14,053 --> 01:26:16,078
Knew I was right.

1065
01:26:16,155 --> 01:26:18,089
I’m so sorry.

1066
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:28,628
One sound, you die.

1067
01:26:33,739 --> 01:26:34,899
Daddy?

1068
01:26:38,577 --> 01:26:40,977
I’m almost done in there.

1069
01:26:41,347 --> 01:26:42,678
Okay?

1070
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:45,311
Come on.

1071
01:26:45,384 --> 01:26:47,079
Let's go.

1072
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,385
How'd you get out?

1073
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:54,626
I opened the door, silly.

1074
01:26:55,194 --> 01:26:56,320
Yeah, but I locked the door.

1075
01:26:56,395 --> 01:26:58,625
Come on, tell me,
how'd you get out of there?

1076
01:26:58,698 --> 01:27:00,222
Grandma.

1077
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:01,698
What do you mean?

1078
01:27:02,068 --> 01:27:03,899
Grandma unlocked the door.

1079
01:27:04,737 --> 01:27:06,864
She says, "Wipe the trouble out

1080
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:08,964
"and let the beauty in."

1081
01:27:13,446 --> 01:27:15,539
She says if I did this to you,

1082
01:27:15,614 --> 01:27:17,309
you'll calm down, Daddy.

1083
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:22,253
And then she said goodbye.

1084
01:27:23,789 --> 01:27:24,778
She did?

1085
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:26,016
Yes.

1086
01:27:28,861 --> 01:27:30,453
I love you so much.

1087
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:33,760
Why don't you practice
your piano for me. Okay?

1088
01:27:37,603 --> 01:27:39,935
Only one hour, then I’ll be back.

1089
01:27:40,006 --> 01:27:41,371
All right?

1090
01:27:41,907 --> 01:27:43,272
Okay.

1091
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:13,028
You're letting us go?

1092
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:42,191
He's free now.

1093
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:13,693
Tommy?

1094
01:29:15,167 --> 01:29:16,691
We're already dead.

1095
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:19,064
What the fuck, bro?

1096
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,931
We're spiritually dead.

1097
01:29:23,742 --> 01:29:24,868
Tommy?

1098
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,807
What you doing, man?

1099
01:29:29,882 --> 01:29:31,679
Don't do anything crazy, bro.
