1
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:46,704
<i>I cannot bear it.</i>

2
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,741
<i>I will not believe
she's gone from all of us,</i>

3
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,376
<i>From me.</i>

4
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:54,378
<i>Melanie wilkes
was my only true friend.</i>

5
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:55,847
<i>How could she leave me now</i>

6
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,083
<i>Just when I need her most?</i>

7
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:15,766
...And commit her body
to the ground.

8
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:19,137
Earth to earth...

9
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:21,389
Ashes to ashes...

10
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:24,876
<i>And, oh,
my poor darling ashley,</i>

11
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,811
<i>Because
of my life's destruction,</i>

12
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,248
<i>Now the only thing left
of me of that wreckage.</i>

13
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,852
Whoa.

14
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,550
<i>This awful day
will be over soon.</i>

15
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:07,686
<i>Then I can go home...</i>

16
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:08,836
<i>To tara.</i>

17
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:31,642
Oh, melanie...

18
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,777
Don't leave me.

19
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:37,349
Please, don't leave me,
melanie.

20
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:41,319
Oh, melanie. Melanie.

21
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,087
Ashley, stop it.

22
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,156
Ashley, don't.

23
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,358
Stop. Stop it.
You mustn't.

24
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,659
Leave my brother
alone.

25
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,995
Take your hands
off of him.

26
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,864
Leave him alone.

27
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,950
Haven't you done
enough harm?

28
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,485
If it's harm to have loved
melanie wilkes

29
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:59,020
With all my heart

30
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,222
And her husband
near as much-

31
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,825
In the name of heaven,
ladies, cease.

32
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:05,460
Cease this instant.

33
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:08,363
I'm ceasing.

34
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,716
Ashley.

35
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,284
Ashley,
come on.

36
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,540
Ashley, come along.

37
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,142
Come along, now.

38
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,353
Hail mary, full of grace,

39
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,255
The lord is with thee.

40
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,290
Blessed art thou
amongst women,

41
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:56,394
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb jesus.

42
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,321
Excuse me, miss scarlett.

43
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,958
Gentleman here
to see you, ma'am.

44
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,993
What gentleman might that be, pansy?

45
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,528
Mr. Hamilton, ma'am.

46
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:13,097
Now, he says you wasn't
expecting him, but-

47
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,632
I'll say I wasn't.

48
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,634
Well, send him
on in, then.

49
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,673
Evening, scarlett.

50
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,208
Well,
here's a surprise.

51
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,743
Have a seat,
I guess.

52
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,828
I just thought
I'd stop by

53
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,863
And see how you're doing...

54
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,065
Mm-hmm.

55
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,934
After all that considerable
upset this morning.

56
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:35,469
That was most unfortunate.

57
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:38,623
Was it really all that
chilly out there, uncle henry,

58
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,159
Or was it only me feeling the cold draft

59
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:43,127
Of pompous
disapproval?

60
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,730
There was a bit
of a nip in the air.

61
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,699
Guess you've got a point
about the other.

62
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,801
Seems like a fair amount
of that disapproval

63
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,371
Was coming off you,
I'd say, henry.

64
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,838
What brings you by,
anyhow?

65
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,774
I thought
I might be able

66
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,643
To offer you
a little advice

67
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,178
That might ease
your situation.

68
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,913
What situation
is that?

69
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,949
The situation
that brought about

70
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,535
That unseemly display
of mutual animosity

71
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,187
At the cemetery, scarlett.

72
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,722
Now let's face
the facts a bit.

73
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,026
Feelings are running real high
against you here in atlanta.

74
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,044
Everybody seems
determined to believe

75
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,697
That you had your eye
and your intentions

76
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,232
Set on ashley wilkes

77
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,967
Right up to the time
melanie passed on.

78
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,420
That's a damn
scurrilous lie!

79
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,988
Scarlett, if I may offer
my best advice,

80
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:31,092
I think it would do
a world of good

81
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,676
For everybody concerned

82
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:36,513
If you would just remove
yourself from atlanta for a while.

83
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:38,582
Give tempers time
to simmer down.

84
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,152
Run away with my tail between my legs?

85
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,921
Well, I guess you'd all be real pleased

86
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,490
To see me take the next boat to timbuktu

87
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,026
On a one-way
passage.

88
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,561
You got the tar, the feathers, and the rail

89
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:51,929
Waiting outside,
have you?

90
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:53,998
I was just making
a kindly suggestion.

91
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,216
No more, no less.

92
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:57,868
I'm making
a kindly suggestion

93
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,237
For you to leave
my house, henry hamilton.

94
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,341
In spite of everything, scarlett,

95
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,376
I want to say
I was real upset

96
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:09,280
To hear about you and rhett
coming to a sorrowful end.

97
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,814
Well, maybe it's
sorrowful,

98
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,584
But whether
it's the end or not

99
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:15,186
Remains to be seen.

100
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,635
Hyah! Come on! Hyah!

101
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,404
Hyah! Come on!

102
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,382
All out for jonesboro.

103
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,916
Scarlett!
Hey, scarlett!

104
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,452
Will!

105
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,453
Oh, will.

106
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,488
I'm so glad to see you,

107
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,023
I'm practically
crying for joy.

108
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,592
Well, I guess you've
been doing enough crying

109
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,127
For grief, scarlett.

110
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,495
Joy wants his turn.

111
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,730
It's been
such a long time,

112
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,198
Almost a year.

113
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,750
More like two,
I guess.

114
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:03,851
You're exaggerating.

115
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,536
Don't believe I am,
scarlett.

116
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,406
Well, we best
get a move on

117
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,842
If we're gonna
beat the dark home.

118
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,677
Let's beat the dark home.

119
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,746
Pansy, see to the luggage.

120
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,781
Hope you don't mind
riding rough.

121
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,350
Figured as long as I was coming to town,

122
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,386
Might as well
get some supplies.

123
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:22,920
I don't mind at all.

124
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,955
How's my dear sister
taking to the idea

125
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:26,991
Of me showing up
on your doorstep

126
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,059
Out of the clear blue sky?

127
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,095
I told suellen to let bygones be bygones.

128
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,130
I'm offering you
the same advice.

129
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,665
I'm hoping
you'll take it.

130
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:38,403
You know I'm not a person
to carry a grudge.

131
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,087
What's happened
to tara, will?

132
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,922
It's looking
downright ramshackle.

133
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,491
Do the best I can
keeping it up

134
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,527
When I'm not
tending the crops.

135
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,061
I know you do, will.

136
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,096
You've always been
a steady man,

137
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,899
The best foreman
we ever had at tara.

138
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,652
I'll bet you've been
a good husband to suellen,

139
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,722
Lots better that frank
kennedy would have been.

140
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,757
Well, coming from the
former mrs. Frank kennedy,

141
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,727
I guess I can take that as a compliment.

142
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,329
I thank you for it.

143
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:23,964
Whoa.

144
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,433
Whoa, now.

145
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,735
Suellen, god's nightgown,
you're having another?

146
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,770
We're still trying
for a boy.

147
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,305
He's trying for a boy.

148
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:34,842
I'm trying to take care
of the two I got.

149
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,444
And speaking
of which,

150
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:40,013
Let me get a look at
my pretty little nieces.

151
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,549
My,
how you've grown.

152
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:44,117
Aunt scarlett's here with
delicious surprises for you.

153
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,653
Oh, your aunt scarlett's

154
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:48,222
Always been one
for surprises.

155
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,341
Uh, let's-let's go in.

156
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,976
Lucius, see to
that luggage, will you?

157
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,512
Yes, sir,
mr. Will.

158
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,548
How have you been
getting along?

159
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,183
Just fine, I guess.

160
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,219
You getting
some good yields?

161
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:03,787
You didn't come back
to tara

162
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,324
To inquire about
our crops, scarlett.

163
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,892
Why are you here?

164
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,361
Why, to see mammy.

165
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,798
And where the dickens
is she, anyhow?

166
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,072
Oh, mammy.

167
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,642
Old mammy
is getting ready

168
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,813
To lay down
her worldly burdens.

169
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:33,384
I love you, mammy.

170
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,888
No need
for speaking

171
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,424
When I already
knows.

172
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,726
Yes, there is a need.

173
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,328
I never told melanie.

174
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,397
And I didn't tell rhett

175
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,015
Until it was too late.

176
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,570
Wouldn't mind
seeing that...

177
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,039
Devil's face again.

178
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,607
And so you will.

179
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,676
So you will.

180
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,557
Come on.
Just going to say hi

181
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,258
To your uncle seth here.

182
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,121
I'd like to send this
to atlanta, if you please.

183
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,355
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,671
This place could use
some sprucing up.

185
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:46,123
Looks almost
as bad as it did

186
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,658
The day
the war ended.

187
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,693
I reckon we could buy
enough whitewash

188
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,228
To paint the entire house

189
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,297
With what that fancy dress
you're wearing cost.

190
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,832
You're not being fair, suellen, as usual.

191
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,902
Haven't I tried a
hundred times to help out?

192
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,437
Hasn't will
been too proud

193
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:01,972
To accept my help?

194
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,574
Your charity, scarlett.

195
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,108
It's not charity.

196
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,594
Tara's still partly
my house, too.

197
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:09,129
It's not charity.

198
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,665
It's trying to make
what's partly mine

199
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,701
A fit place
to live in.

200
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,235
Yours and mine...

201
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:18,088
And the sisters of mercy
convent.

202
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,490
What do you mean?

203
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,625
The startling fact is
that our baby sister

204
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,928
Handed over her share
of tara to the convent.

205
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,498
It's her dowry
upon her entry

206
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,984
Into the service of jesus.

207
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,518
Careen did that?

208
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,904
Looks like you'll be having
the catholic church

209
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:37,207
To contend with before you
can make good your intentions.

210
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,676
What intentions?

211
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,346
Finding a way of throwing
us out to live like crackers.

212
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,047
You's way over the line.

213
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,783
I'll say she is.

214
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,386
I wanted us to be a family
again. Tara's our home.

215
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,372
I wanted us to be a family again in it.

216
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,475
Doesn't seem to be
a chance of that

217
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,794
As long as you hold your grudge against me

218
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,863
For something that happened
a hundred years ago.

219
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,966
Guess it wasn't all that long ago, was it?

220
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,033
Ladies, please?

221
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,703
She won't let
the past be past.

222
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,172
You're not the one
who had her beau stolen

223
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,258
From under her nose
by her very own sister.

224
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,377
If you knew what
kind of a husband

225
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,379
Frank kennedy
turned out to be,

226
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,947
You'd be
thanking me.

227
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,749
You stole frank
to pay the taxes on tara.

228
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:22,820
You lied to him, telling
him I had another beau.

229
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,822
You only married charles
hamilton out of spite

230
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,256
Because ashley
married melanie,

231
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:27,725
And you couldn't
bear it.

232
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,727
I guess careen
is the saint

233
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:32,262
Amongst the three
o'hara sisters.

234
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,314
I obviously
do not qualify.

235
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:45,776
Well, so much
for bygones, I guess.

236
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:49,446
That's belle watling's
place, isn't it?

237
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,482
Yes, sir.
Welcome to atlanta.

238
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,928
Yeow!

239
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,934
You are a feisty
little girl.

240
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,138
He come right back
to me.

241
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,142
Pick a card.

242
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:22,796
Put it back.

243
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:39,030
That's amazing.

244
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,481
How did you do that?

245
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:43,317
Show me again,
rhett.

246
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,435
I bet
I'll figure it out.

247
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,904
One time per trick,
honey.

248
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,939
Depending on the trick.

249
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,874
I bet
I'll figure it out

250
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,626
If I seen it
one more time.

251
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,581
Pick a card.

252
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,253
Don't let me
see it, now.

253
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,189
You got it fixed
in your mind?

254
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,858
Uh-huh.

255
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,392
Then put it back.

256
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:23,607
If I have it wrong,

257
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:25,292
You win.

258
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,979
If I have it right,

259
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,498
I win.

260
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,817
What do you win?

261
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,020
How many guesses you need,
luli?

262
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,176
Oh, rhett.

263
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:44,661
Take her away, fellas.

264
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,230
Don't shortchange
him, luli.

265
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,765
Now, can I interest
any of you gentlemen

266
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,701
In a game of chance?

267
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,953
Always a pleasure doing
business with you, rhett.

268
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,179
Evening, mr. Butler.

269
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:29,323
There's a telegram
for you, sir.

270
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,544
Thanks.

271
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,575
Good to see you, rhett.

272
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,943
You're looking well.

273
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:06,944
Suellen.

274
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,445
Prosperous, I might say.

275
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:11,381
Your survival of our
ignominious defeat in the war

276
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,552
Appears to have flourished
with the passage of time.

277
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,621
I've had me
some luck, suellen.

278
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,089
Hmm.

279
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,891
Thank you
for informing me

280
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,492
Of mammy's
dire state.

281
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,127
Came as soon
as I could.

282
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:25,663
Me?
Your telegram.

283
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,665
I didn't send you
a telegram.

284
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,701
Was there another will
benteen I didn't know about?

285
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,103
I assumed it was scarlett
let you know.

286
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,471
Scarlett.

287
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,072
Hello, rhett.

288
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,966
Mammy, mammy,
I brought you my promise.

289
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,484
Look.

290
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:50,053
Look who's come to see you.

291
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,956
Hello, old girl.

292
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:58,395
Am I still a mule
in a horse harness?

293
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:02,266
Who would ever call
mr. Rhett butler that?

294
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,134
You would, and did.

295
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:09,038
I must have
been teasing.

296
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:10,607
You must have been.

297
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:16,547
You wouldn't
hold it against me

298
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:19,549
If I asked you
a favor, mr. Rhett?

299
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:20,784
Not a chance, mammy.

300
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:25,956
Remember that fine red
silk petticoat you give me?

301
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,960
Yeah. I never gave a prettier to anyone.

302
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,962
I want you to see

303
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,397
That I'm laid
to rest in it.

304
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:37,534
I'll make sure
it goes with you, mammy.

305
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:42,940
Would I be asking
too many promises

306
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,843
If I was to have
one more?

307
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,045
Anything you want, mammy.

308
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:53,650
I want you to take care
of miss scarlett.

309
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:57,654
She needs caring for
so bad.

310
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,329
I will, mammy.

311
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,967
Always needed caring
so bad,

312
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:13,770
Miss scarlett did.

313
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:31,805
Thank you, mammy.

314
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:48,405
I just can't imagine tara without mammy.

315
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,406
Can you?

316
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:52,008
Why did you sign
will's name

317
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,511
To that telegraph
you sent me?

318
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,414
It was just a little bit of a fib.

319
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,416
I was afraid
you wouldn't come

320
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,418
If you knew
I was here.

321
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:03,420
For mammy,
I would have come.

322
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:05,655
Well,
I'm glad you did.

323
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,124
Apart from mammy,

324
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:09,626
I just thought
it would be

325
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,128
A perfectly
natural location

326
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,130
For courteous and civilized conversation

327
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:14,631
Between husband
and wife,

328
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:17,634
However strained relations
might be between us

329
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:19,303
At the present time.

330
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,411
I was sorry you couldn't
be at melanie's funeral.

331
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:28,912
I was traveling.

332
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,414
So I heard.

333
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,916
I laid some flowers
on her grave.

334
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,418
And bonnie's?

335
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:35,819
Hmm...

336
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:40,924
I wonder sometimes if things
might have been different

337
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,492
If our child
hadn't died.

338
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,429
Do you ever
wonder that?

339
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,630
No.

340
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,167
I've missed you,
rhett.

341
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,938
I've missed you so.

342
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,273
I hope you don't
expect me

343
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,875
To echo that sentiment.

344
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:01,377
Well, I thought
you might be able

345
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,279
To express some
semblance of it

346
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,782
After what you said
upstairs to mammy.

347
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,783
I lied.

348
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,284
Don't say you lied.

349
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:09,786
I will not
tolerate it.

350
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:12,455
I lied to make a dear old
woman's last moments happy.

351
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:15,192
No gentleman would lie about such a matter.

352
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,094
No, I don't suppose
a gentleman would.

353
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,349
You are such a child,
scarlett.

354
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,969
You've known me
all these years,

355
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,889
Yet when it suits,
pleases, or satisfies you,

356
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:31,391
You can forget
all you've learned.

357
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:32,893
Nothing's changed,
scarlett. Nothing.

358
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,410
I offered you a divorce.

359
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:36,463
You ready
to accept it yet?

360
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:37,981
I will never
divorce you.

361
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,516
You'd be free
to marry ashley.

362
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,135
I don't want ashley.

363
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,637
He was only ever
some figment

364
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,623
Of my silly
girlish dreams.

365
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,825
Let me make
amends, rhett.

366
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:51,828
Please, please
let me make amends.

367
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:54,330
Whatever amends you care
to make are your concern.

368
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:56,867
I'll not be
a party to them.

369
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:59,336
I hope you'll change
your mind about a divorce.

370
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,087
I think it's
the only possibility

371
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:04,007
Of some kind
of peace between us.

372
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,928
In the meantime,
I'll see to it

373
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:09,847
We're seen
often enough in public

374
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:11,348
To keep the gossip down.

375
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:12,916
I'm leaving in the morning.

376
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,418
Good night, my dear.

377
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:19,356
The yankees
should have hung you

378
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:21,191
When they had
the chance!

379
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:32,769
Whoa.

380
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,977
I've come to see
how ashley is.

381
00:24:58,045 --> 00:25:00,413
You are not
welcome here, scarlett.

382
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:02,382
I made a promise
to melanie.

383
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,117
I intend
to keep it.

384
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:06,403
Do you intend
to step aside

385
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,905
And let me come in
like a lady,

386
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,308
Or do I have to
knock you over?

387
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,943
Ashley is in no humor
to receive visitors,

388
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,412
Least of all
unexpected ones.

389
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,480
Where is he?

390
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:18,948
You can either
tell me, india,

391
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,950
Or I'm going to
find him.

392
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,789
Get away!

393
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,390
Damn it!

394
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,627
Miss scarlett.

395
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,895
Dearest, I-

396
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,364
I didn't know you were back in atlanta.

397
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,867
Don't you look
the dickens?

398
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,802
<i>What are you doing?</i>

399
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,305
Doing? Why...

400
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,806
Nothing.

401
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,407
What I hear is

402
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,309
You haven't been seen
in public

403
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,411
Since the day
of the funeral.

404
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,913
Really?

405
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,816
Well, I suppose
that might well be.

406
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:55,819
I've rather lost track.

407
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:57,320
Maybe it's time

408
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:59,322
You found it again,
ashley.

409
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:02,325
You mustn't worry about me,
scarlett.

410
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:03,827
I'll be fine.

411
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,328
Really I will.

412
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,347
When are you going
to start trying to be?

413
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:11,384
I just can't bring myself

414
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:13,904
To believe it, you see.

415
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:17,841
I know how that is-

416
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:21,410
Somebody you love
dying.

417
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,448
You go to sleep
every night,

418
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,450
And it's gone
for a while,

419
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,252
And you wake up
remembering.

420
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,938
There isn't a moment
of a day

421
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:35,374
That I don't feel her...

422
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,443
Near...

423
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,445
And think that...

424
00:26:38,512 --> 00:26:42,465
If I were merely to turn...

425
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,501
There she'd be...

426
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,523
My melanie.

427
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:56,079
Oh, scarlett...

428
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:59,449
How can I go on
without her?

429
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:05,421
You're going to have
to find a way, my darling,

430
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:07,490
And you will.

431
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:08,992
How?

432
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,493
Well, not like this,

433
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:11,995
Locking yourself away

434
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,497
And tormenting yourself

435
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:15,916
With what's never
going to be.

436
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:19,002
You can stare at that door
until you're old and gray,

437
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,504
And melly's never
going to come through it.

438
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:22,955
Scarlett,
you are harsh.

439
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,575
Not in my heart.

440
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:30,413
I know nobody loved melly
the way you did,

441
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:33,516
But you're not the only one
who did love her.

442
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,018
And the rest of us

443
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,021
Aren't going to curl up
and die from it,

444
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,522
And neither are you.

445
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,026
Maybe you should be giving
some thought to your son,

446
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,527
Melanie's son.

447
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,529
You're all he's got now.

448
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:49,032
Is this what
you want her to see

449
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,034
Looking down on you
from heaven-

450
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,536
Her boy all alone
and grieving alone

451
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:56,539
Because his pa feels too sorry
for himself to remember him,

452
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:59,109
To remember what he needs?

453
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,612
You shame me now,
scarlett.

454
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:05,048
Pa used to say

455
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,051
Some of the best things
folks have ever done

456
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,552
Come out of their shame

457
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,621
For the things
they did before.

458
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,557
Now, do you think

459
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,560
Maybe I could have
a cup of tea?

460
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:20,130
And we'll talk things over.

461
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,135
Tea.

462
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,612
So, now,

463
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,681
What's the situation
with scarlett of late?

464
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,716
I offered her a divorce.

465
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,253
If I know scarlett,

466
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,821
She ain't taking you
up on that.

467
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:46,823
Not yet.

468
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,358
You got more chance

469
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,393
Of her giving you
a divorce

470
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,927
Than you do

471
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:55,565
Of getting into
a bank on Sunday.

472
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,102
You going
to the ball this year?

473
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:00,103
What ball?

474
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,138
What ball?
The masked ball.

475
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:03,640
The carnival.

476
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,674
I expect
you already received

477
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:07,777
Your fancy engraved

478
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,813
Personal invite.

479
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,264
Well, I don't know.

480
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,866
Probably.

481
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,418
You get yours?

482
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:16,352
Ha!

483
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,972
That'll be the day.

484
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,557
But you ought to go,
you know.

485
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,010
Probably do you
a world of good.

486
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:26,579
I didn't know
I was in need

487
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:28,614
Of being done
a world of good.

488
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:31,767
The only thing darker
than your hair of late

489
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,303
Has been your countenance.

490
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,838
I been looking
all that glum?

491
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,874
You haven't been altogether
sparkly, you know.

492
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,444
I think a bit of
your former social life

493
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,513
Might very well
perk you up.

494
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,548
You want
to perk me up?

495
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:46,449
Climb in here with me.

496
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:47,984
This ain't built for two.

497
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:49,536
It depends on which two.

498
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:50,570
Come on.

499
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:53,272
Aah!

500
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,342
Why don't you
come home to pa?

501
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,644
That's it.

502
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:02,832
How do things stand
with my store

503
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,285
And the warehouses
and the land?

504
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,304
Everything is better
than well.

505
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:10,440
It was a more
fortunate decision

506
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,974
Than you may
have realized

507
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,577
When you sold
your sawmill to ashley.

508
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,045
Why?

509
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,547
Well, it's going under.

510
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,315
Builders always
need lumber.

511
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:21,217
If they're building.

512
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:23,152
I know you're
not interested

513
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,187
In what happens
in the world

514
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:27,123
Unless it concerns you,

515
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:30,193
But you have got one of
the best business heads

516
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,827
That I have ever met,

517
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:34,364
Despite the fact
that you're a female.

518
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:35,898
You might as well know

519
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,434
There was a considerable
financial scandal

520
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:41,271
In new york
three weeks ago.

521
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,490
What about my money?

522
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,024
Are the banks safe?

523
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:47,026
The one holding
your funds is.

524
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,611
But investments
are very tight,

525
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:50,146
And that means
building, too.

526
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:52,098
And if nobody's
building,

527
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,600
Nobody needs lumber.

528
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,134
Are you saying ashley

529
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:57,170
Is really in serious
financial difficulty?

530
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:59,205
You can't boom
without bucks.

531
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,240
This is delicious
sponge cake.

532
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,311
I want my cook
to have this recipe.

533
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:07,880
Who's the best builder
in atlanta, henry?

534
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:09,382
Well, define best.

535
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,000
Who can build

536
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:12,535
A reasonably
respectable structure

537
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,571
Without stealing
too much?

538
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,973
That's a difficult
parley, scarlett.

539
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,608
I'm asking for advice,

540
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,343
Not discouraging opinions.

541
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,511
I suppose a person

542
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:25,148
Could do worse
than big sam. Why?

543
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:28,284
Big sam. What do you mean, our big sam?

544
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:29,919
Our foreman at tara?

545
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,856
Formerly your big sam,
scarlett.

546
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:36,159
Does the name lincoln
ring a bell with you?

547
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,737
I got to say it,
miss scarlett.

548
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:51,491
You are a sight
for sore eyes.

549
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,492
Heh heh!

550
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,094
And maybe make them
water a bit, too.

551
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:57,129
You could've knocked me
over with a feather

552
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:58,665
When mr. Hamilton
told me

553
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,783
About your
coming back to atlanta

554
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,953
And your subsequent
good fortune, big sam.

555
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:06,956
The north didn't suit me
after a time.

556
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:09,125
But I did prosper.

557
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,960
I did prosper,

558
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,896
Enough so's
I could come home

559
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,498
And establish my little
business enterprise.

560
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,500
I'm glad to see you're
doing so well for yourself.

561
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:22,171
I'm here to offer you the
opportunity for lots better.

562
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,707
I'm just holding my breath,
miss scarlett,

563
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:26,742
Hoping you're going
to ask me

564
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,912
To build you
a big, new, fine house.

565
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,947
I'm thinking more
along the lines

566
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:35,134
Of maybe 25, big sam.

567
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,869
50 acres, sam.

568
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:38,872
I'm not utilizing
all of it.

569
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,990
I won't require
that much land

570
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,525
To build, what,
25 houses.

571
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,061
25 small houses
on standard lots.

572
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,596
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,130
Who supplies
your lumber, sam?

574
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:50,667
The harrison lumber works
mostly.

575
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,702
Good quality,
fair prices.

576
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,305
If you keep your eye
on them.

577
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:59,158
You'll be getting your
lumber elsewhere for this job.

578
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:02,362
How many good rafters
you got over there?

579
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:06,299
25 houses?

580
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,833
Yes, sir, mr. Wilkes.

581
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,403
I've recently been
contracted to build them.

582
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,938
I'd be mighty pleased

583
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,473
If your outfit could
supply the lumber

584
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,009
To build them with.

585
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:18,544
I don't see why
it wouldn't be possible.

586
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:20,079
I will say, sam,

587
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:22,615
It seems a somewhat
precarious investment

588
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:24,650
For anyone in these
uncertain times.

589
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:26,185
Who are the developers?

590
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:29,222
Some folks I was in
business with up north

591
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,756
For a short spell.

592
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:33,293
Nice fellas. Highly spoken of up there.

593
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,362
Probably will be down
here, too, in the south,

594
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,898
Where they're expecting to
expand their business interests.

595
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:40,433
25 homes.

596
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,968
Even of the modest
dimensions

597
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:44,503
You've suggested, sam...

598
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:46,539
It's a good deal
of lumber.

599
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:48,074
I'd say so, mr. Wilkes.

600
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:51,644
Yes, indeed. We're discussing
a whole lot of lumber here.

601
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:54,680
Could be a profitable
discussion.

602
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:57,283
Yes, yes,
I expect it could.

603
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,406
I want you to draw up
a contract

604
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:06,893
Between samuel o'hara
building company

605
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,962
And atlanta acres
real estate incorporated.

606
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,482
Who in the world
are they?

607
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,017
They are me, uncle henry.

608
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,587
And I'm hereby
officially calling upon

609
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,622
The traditional
confidentiality

610
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,158
Existing between
a lawyer and his client.

611
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,194
What are you up to,
scarlett?

612
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,829
I'm up to keeping
a promise.

613
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:29,365
And if keeping it
means losing some money

614
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:31,400
In order to keep
ashley wilkes

615
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:33,502
From going belly up
in the sun,

616
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,422
Then...I'll just have
to take the loss this time.

617
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,524
Tomorrow's another day.

618
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:46,683
This is something
I thought I'd never see

619
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,718
In these days of
blatant opportunism.

620
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,253
These are quality
construction.

621
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,788
For once,
the less fortunate

622
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,240
Can be treated
as well as the rich.

623
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:55,841
It would appear

624
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,843
That maybe all
the old values

625
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:59,395
Haven't been
entirely lost.

626
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:01,964
It does seem that way,
doesn't it?

627
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:04,500
I'm honored to be part
of this.

628
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:07,036
I hope there's some financial
benefit to be derived

629
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:10,105
From all this honorable
and uplifting endeavor.

630
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,141
You can't imagine,
scarlett.

631
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,676
No, I suppose not.

632
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,177
I have to confess,

633
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:17,747
I have virtually no head
for commerce.

634
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,283
My business
is on the brink.

635
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,818
Then like a bolt
from the blue,

636
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:24,854
Big sam walked
into my office.

637
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:27,923
The good lord must've
been looking down on me.

638
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,893
I just know he was.

639
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:54,667
Well, I was getting
worried about you.

640
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:04,243
Well, your mother
is of her own mind.

641
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,595
Imagine her
having the nerve

642
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,630
To show her face
here tonight.

643
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:26,165
Ah, but what a face.

644
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:28,201
You men are all the same.

645
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:29,735
Ha ha ha!

646
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:31,770
Good evening, henry,
aunt pittypat.

647
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,273
Aren't you looking royal?

648
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:36,275
I gather
you've come alone,

649
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:38,811
But it's just not done
in polite society.

650
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:41,914
Well, so far I haven't
found so much polite

651
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,399
In the society
this evening.

652
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,000
I'll have to keep looking.

653
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:46,402
And as for being alone,

654
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,037
Well, I never am.

655
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,822
God is always with me.

656
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:52,325
I'll save a dance
for you, henry.

657
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:54,560
Have you saved
one for me, scarlett?

658
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:57,696
Why, ashley,
you know I have.

659
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:19,017
Remember when we
used to dance, ashley?

660
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:21,554
It's hard to remember sometimes.

661
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:24,623
I wonder if any of us
will ever dance again

662
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:27,159
The way we used to
before the war.

663
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:28,694
Our hearts
were different then.

664
00:37:28,762 --> 00:37:30,730
Everything was
different then.

665
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:33,265
I miss it so,
don't you, scarlett?

666
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,301
Will it ever be that
way again, do you think?

667
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,837
I guess not.

668
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:40,639
We've got to keep
dancing, don't we?

669
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,017
Oh, my lord.

670
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:53,552
What is it, scarlett?

671
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,088
I haven't trod
on your toe, have I?

672
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:57,122
He's here.

673
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,157
He's here, ashley.

674
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:00,693
I didn't think
he'd come.

675
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:03,295
I hardly dared hope.

676
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:10,870
That's the silliest
looking thing

677
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,405
I've ever seen.

678
00:38:12,472 --> 00:38:14,440
Who are you
supposed to be?

679
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:15,941
Keep a civil tongue

680
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:18,010
In your pretty head,
young miss.

681
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:19,512
You are addressing
edward teach,

682
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:21,547
The most fearsome pirate,

683
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:25,117
Known far and wide
as blackbeard.

684
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,653
Bluebeard would
be more like it.

685
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:29,187
Did you recognize
me, too?

686
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:32,758
I don't need to find the most
ostentatious gown in the room

687
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,794
To know who was under it.

688
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:37,329
I might've known you'd
say something mean.

689
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:40,399
I'd know you with a
flour sack on your head.

690
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,934
How would you
manage that?

691
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:44,970
I'm too much of a gentleman
this evening to say.

692
00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:47,072
I believe you've
been drinking.

693
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:57,650
Did you come to see me?

694
00:38:57,717 --> 00:39:00,686
No, I came to be seen,
scarlett, not to see.

695
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:02,220
I'm taking the opportunity

696
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,757
To fulfill our obligations
to the social amenities.

697
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,792
Keeping down
the gossip,

698
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,828
That's all you
came for.

699
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:10,863
You didn't come
to see me.

700
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,397
That-a girl, dear scarlett.

701
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,866
Whisper your
sweet nothings

702
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,434
Into my burning ears.

703
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:19,605
You're as tipsy as
a termite in a beer barrel.

704
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,982
I assume that weapon
is not loaded.

705
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,518
I don't think
I'd chance

706
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:36,755
Being in such close proximity
to you with a loaded pistol.

707
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:39,826
I suppose you'll be staying
the night at the house.

708
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:41,360
Imagine
the gossip tomorrow

709
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:44,396
If I were to check into
the harmon hotel tonight.

710
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,900
I understand you made a spectacle
of yourself at melanie's funeral.

711
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,120
I was only keeping ashley from
making a spectacle of himself.

712
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,672
Ashley had a right
to be a spectacle.

713
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,674
He was well
within his bounds.

714
00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:57,710
You were way outside
of yours.

715
00:39:57,777 --> 00:40:00,278
You just persist
in breaking the rules.

716
00:40:00,346 --> 00:40:03,415
You know that I'd hold you
to account for that.

717
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,952
I've always found it to be one
of your few agreeable aspects.

718
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,955
I don't care what the
mucky-mucks think of me.

719
00:40:10,023 --> 00:40:13,025
I never have, and I'm not going to start.

720
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:14,527
The more you
natter on,

721
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,430
The more fortunate for you
that that pistol isn't loaded.

722
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:20,533
Whoa!

723
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,105
Good night,
mr. Rhett.

724
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:30,142
Miss scarlett.

725
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:34,146
Y'all have pleasant
dreams, now.

726
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,185
You once carried me
across this threshold.

727
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:59,655
You can rest assured
that won't happen again.

728
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:49,855
Who is it?

729
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:51,256
What do you want?

730
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:53,209
It's just me,
miss scarlett.

731
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:55,478
I brought you
a pot of coffee.

732
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:56,879
I don't want it.

733
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:58,981
Miss scarlett,
maybe it would-

734
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,117
Get out before I take
a strap to you.

735
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:05,554
Why would you do that now
that slave days is over?

736
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:09,075
You never done when slave days still was.

737
00:42:09,142 --> 00:42:11,226
There were plenty
of times I wanted to.

738
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:14,613
Yes'm,
I could see that.

739
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:16,815
Go away.

740
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:18,350
You're doing yourself
real hurt,

741
00:42:18,418 --> 00:42:19,385
Miss scarlett.

742
00:42:19,452 --> 00:42:20,987
It's breaking my heart

743
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:23,071
To see you
breaking yours.

744
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:27,143
The only hurt there's going to
be around here is me hurting you

745
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,578
If you don't remove yourself
from my sight.

746
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,814
It wouldn't be
you hurting me.

747
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,382
What's in that
bottle there,

748
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,335
And you'd wake up weeping and
moaning for the doing of it.

749
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:38,871
Spare yourself the hurt
and me the weeping.

750
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:40,106
Well...

751
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:43,709
It's just something
I had to say is all.

752
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:57,422
Pansy!

753
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,041
I want you
to wash my hair.

754
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:01,577
And start packing.

755
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,079
We're going
to charleston.

756
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:07,599
Just lots more
hurtin' in charleston.

757
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,968
Now arriving
in charleston,

758
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:13,271
The express train
from columbia.

759
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:19,911
Oh, there she is.
There she is.

760
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:22,314
Aunt eulalie!
Aunt pauline!

761
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,349
Miss scarlett.

762
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,950
Oh, darling.

763
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,954
Shall we tell her now?

764
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:30,456
Tell me what?

765
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:31,990
Let's tell her now.

766
00:43:32,058 --> 00:43:33,609
Tell me what?

767
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,579
Soon as we got your letter
telling us you were coming,

768
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:39,147
We mentioned it
to eleanor butler.

769
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:40,666
You told rhett's mother?

770
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:43,702
We presumed she was already
cognizant to the fact,

771
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,771
You being
her daughter-in-law.

772
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,273
She was just as surprised as we were.

773
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:52,043
We said you would be
staying with us at our house.

774
00:43:52,111 --> 00:43:55,080
She said, "why, she'll
be doing no such thing."

775
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:58,149
She said, "you bring her
directly to my doorstep,

776
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:01,186
Or you will never hear
the end of it."

777
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:04,256
You will never hear
the end of it.

778
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:05,874
Is rhett there?

779
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,376
Rhett's up north.

780
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:09,411
Buying back some of
the family silver

781
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,746
The yankees stole.

782
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,682
Are you saying I'll be
a guest of mrs. Butler's?

783
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,218
She's invited me
to stay with her?

784
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:18,754
What could be more
natural and fitting, child?

785
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,856
It's your husband's
home, too.

786
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:45,214
Oh, my dear scarlett.

787
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,748
Oh.

788
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:49,818
I'm so glad
you've come home.

789
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:52,921
I've been longing
for you to come.

790
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:59,027
We'll go to market tomorrow.

791
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:01,564
You'll meet everyone
you should know there.

792
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:05,634
It's the traditional place
to learn all the news, too.

793
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:07,186
The newspapers don't print

794
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:08,720
The really
interesting things.

795
00:45:08,788 --> 00:45:11,756
I suppose you couldn't
help being aware of

796
00:45:11,824 --> 00:45:13,292
The unfortunate presence
in charleston

797
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,826
Of so many yankee soldiers.

798
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:17,363
I know you've
been rid of them

799
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,898
For some very long time
up in atlanta.

800
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:21,933
We've been occupied
for so long,

801
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:23,469
We hardly notice them
anymore.

802
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:26,505
I'll never get
used to them, never.

803
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:29,574
Well, then we'll just
have to do our best

804
00:45:29,642 --> 00:45:32,111
To distract you
from their presence.

805
00:45:32,178 --> 00:45:34,213
We can begin
this very day.

806
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,581
My committee is meeting
here this afternoon.

807
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:38,633
You must join us,

808
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:40,202
If only for tea.

809
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,271
I wouldn't want to prevail
on you to participate.

810
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,740
In what?

811
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,809
We raise money
with cake sales

812
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,844
And bazaars of handicrafts
and such

813
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,014
For the confederate home
for widows and orphans.

814
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,182
I'd be quite pleased
to participate

815
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,868
In something like that.

816
00:45:55,935 --> 00:45:58,520
Oh, lovely.

817
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,557
Every bit of help helps.

818
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,042
Giddyap! Come on!

819
00:46:06,946 --> 00:46:10,682
Giddyap! Come on!

820
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,718
Giddyap!

821
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:15,487
Sally!

822
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:20,926
Watch it!

823
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,031
Sally.

824
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:36,257
Jehoshaphat!

825
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:37,993
We're here.

826
00:46:39,762 --> 00:46:42,164
Who in the heck
is that?

827
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,665
Sally brewton.

828
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:46,918
She can be mad
as a March hare at times.

829
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:48,770
Margaret, emma,

830
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:50,272
We have arrived.

831
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,342
Oh, my.

832
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:58,413
Well, it's another perfectly
thrilling ride, sally.

833
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,982
One's soul looks
forward to it.

834
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,651
Speak for yourself.

835
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,052
Yoo-hoo!

836
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,470
Eleanor!

837
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,039
Ha ha ha!

838
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:09,574
Who's that with you?

839
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:11,109
The new recruit

840
00:47:11,177 --> 00:47:13,913
For our disgustingly
noble cause?

841
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,199
I had always heard that
you would turn the heads

842
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,734
On tin soldiers.

843
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,369
I'm pleased to see that
nobody was exaggerating.

844
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:22,504
Smoke?

845
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:25,140
No, thank you.
I don't indulge.

846
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:29,211
Your husband and I go back
to when he was in knee pants

847
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,849
And I was wondering what those
two funny bumps was on my chest.

848
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:37,119
Eleanor, where has that son
of yours been keeping himself?

849
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,137
He's in
philadelphia.

850
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:41,724
What the pluperfect heck
is he doing there?

851
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,792
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

852
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,594
Rhett!

853
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,898
I believe you rang
for tea, mrs. Butler.

854
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,299
Rhett, darling.

855
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:53,001
Is that what
I think it is?

856
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:55,337
Is that my tea service?

857
00:47:55,404 --> 00:47:57,873
<i>Oh, lord, it is
my tea service.</i>

858
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,442
Where on earth
did you find it?

859
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:02,044
Philadelphia.

860
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,213
The place is bursting
with yankee plunder.

861
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:07,783
I brought a little bit
of it home...

862
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,518
To its rightful place.

863
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:12,788
I think I'm going to cry.

864
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:16,225
If I ever had a son, I'd
want to be just like rhett.

865
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:18,560
A husband would've been
even better.

866
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:19,762
Sally! Sally!

867
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:24,032
How you been keeping,
you wolf in wolf's clothing?

868
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,202
I proposed to you on a number of occasions.

869
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,122
You were about
12 years old at the time.

870
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,141
I wanted to get
my bid in early.

871
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:34,509
Hello, rhett.

872
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,650
Ahem.

873
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,085
It is a fortunate man

874
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:46,321
Who's offered a greater
surprise than he offered.

875
00:48:46,388 --> 00:48:48,924
I don't believe you know
our newest member

876
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:50,291
Miss anne hampton.

877
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,244
How do you do,
miss hampton?

878
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:53,812
Charmed to finally
meet you.

879
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,397
I've heard so much
about you.

880
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,182
Your tender ears
must be sizzling.

881
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,334
Welcome home, rhett, honey.

882
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:02,003
Welcome to charleston,
scarlett...

883
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:03,572
Honey.

884
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,525
You might seriously hurt
my arm, rhett butler!

885
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:09,061
What are you
doing here?

886
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:11,096
I sure didn't
come all this way

887
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:13,131
To lend my time
and efforts

888
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,168
To the confederate widows
and orphans sewing society.

889
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:18,287
I'm here
to be with you.

890
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:19,755
I no longer love you.

891
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:22,791
Don't say that. I'm your
wife. You're my husband.

892
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,344
An unfortunate circumstance
I offered to correct.

893
00:49:25,411 --> 00:49:27,562
I will never divorce you
- never, never!

894
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,464
Your mother's overjoyed
that I'm here.

895
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:32,333
What will you tell her
if you throw me out?

896
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,235
'cause I'll tell her
the truth,

897
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:35,771
And it'll
break her heart.

898
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,473
I don't have to
throw you out.

899
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,342
Sooner or later,
you'll reveal yourself.

900
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:43,112
You think you can pass
yourself off as a lady.

901
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:45,047
Charleston gentry
will see through you.

902
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,049
I am a lady,
damn you!

903
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,951
You couldn't fool
a blind, deaf mule.

904
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:51,319
Show me
your clothes.

905
00:49:51,387 --> 00:49:54,356
I assume you've armed
yourself with a new wardrobe

906
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,890
To win back
my favors,

907
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,961
All of it in your typically awful taste.

908
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:00,996
Now show me
your new frocks.

909
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,015
I'll see what can be salvaged, if anything.

910
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:39,050
Don't catch cold trying
to be alluring, scarlett.

911
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:40,585
You're wasting
your time.

912
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:43,121
I think I've been
wasting my time

913
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:46,191
Since the day I first
laid eyes on you.

914
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:48,226
Get rid of
all this lace.

915
00:50:48,294 --> 00:50:51,296
It's supposed to be a
dress, not a tablecloth.

916
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:54,482
Get rid of this one
altogether. It's hopeless.

917
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,868
Change these gold
buttons for black ones

918
00:50:56,936 --> 00:50:58,236
And shorten the train.

919
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:00,822
Ha ha ha. There's enough bows on this

920
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,257
To decorate
a christmas tree.

921
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,326
I hope you're enjoying
insulting me.

922
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:06,361
As a matter of fact,
I am.

923
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:09,464
See if you can make one
of these presentable enough

924
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:11,432
To be seen in
this evening.

925
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,036
My mother was
a robillard from savannah,

926
00:51:14,053 --> 00:51:17,105
And the o'haras are descended
from the kings of ireland.

927
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,207
Every irishman
I've ever heard of

928
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:22,244
Seems to have been
descended from a king.

929
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,914
Is it just the one king,
scarlett, or were there several?

930
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,052
Ha ha ha.

931
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,504
I hate you.

932
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:33,505
Ha ha ha!

933
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:35,574
I hate you!

934
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:38,577
Looks like that royal
irish blood, miss hampton.

935
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:42,030
Sometimes it gets them
carried away.

936
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:54,175
Won't rhett be joining us, miss eleanor?

937
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:56,595
I'd hoped to have my
first charleston breakfast

938
00:51:56,663 --> 00:51:58,647
With the company
of my husband.

939
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:02,284
Oh, but I thought
you knew, my dear.

940
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:06,888
Well, there-there was a
note from rhett this morning.

941
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,724
He left last night.

942
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,627
He's gone up-river
to dunmore landing.

943
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,294
Didn't he tell you?

944
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:18,233
Well, aren't I
the perfect dunce?

945
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,303
Certainly he told me.
Completely left my mind.

946
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:24,806
What a silly willy I am-
certainly, your plantation.

947
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:29,361
Yes. He spends quite a bit
of his time there these days,

948
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:31,480
As you're
no doubt aware.

949
00:52:31,547 --> 00:52:33,248
Well...

950
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,916
Maybe it's just as well

951
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:38,236
I have a private moment
with you, miss eleanor.

952
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:39,821
Oh?

953
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:43,992
I need you to help me,
miss eleanor.

954
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,626
Well, of course,
scarlett.

955
00:52:45,694 --> 00:52:47,729
How may I? Anything.

956
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,198
I want to
look like a lady.

957
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:51,833
Well, now, scarlett.

958
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:53,635
I know that I don't,

959
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,371
But I want to know
what I'm doing wrong.

960
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,705
I am a lady.

961
00:52:57,773 --> 00:53:00,275
Well, of course
you are, scarlett.

962
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:05,012
Well, it may be that you
have so much vitality,

963
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,048
I mean, all the vigor

964
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:10,618
Of the world
you grew up in,

965
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:11,653
It's misleading
to people here

966
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,990
In the old,
tired, low country.

967
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:21,062
Still, you have no need of
rouge on your lovely face,

968
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,966
And your clothes are...

969
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,000
Well...

970
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:27,035
Uh...

971
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,071
As some of
your clothes are,

972
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:31,606
Ill considered.

973
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:35,210
Yes, w-we'll just
have to find ways

974
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,546
To make you
more like us.

975
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:39,581
Then you'll be
more comfortable.

976
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:40,582
Heh.

977
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:43,285
And I suppose
you will be, too.

978
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:47,155
Well, I would
never have said so.

979
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,641
Fresh fish! It's over here!

980
00:53:52,811 --> 00:53:54,346
Go on, now.

981
00:53:56,915 --> 00:53:59,951
And, uh, baked goods,
and they're so delicious.

982
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:03,021
You could gain 20 pounds
just by looking.

983
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:06,157
Oh, yes, um, I want
some sausage, please.

984
00:54:06,225 --> 00:54:09,260
I'm afraid you're a
little late, mrs. Butler.

985
00:54:10,562 --> 00:54:12,530
You don't
want those onions.

986
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:14,065
They're no good.

987
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:15,066
No good?

988
00:54:15,134 --> 00:54:16,601
What's wrong with them?

989
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:18,136
They're not rotten
or sprouting.

990
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:20,171
They've been
dug up too soon.

991
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:23,375
They look fine, but they
won't have any flavor.

992
00:54:23,442 --> 00:54:25,243
Take my word for it.

993
00:54:25,311 --> 00:54:26,511
How do you know?

994
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:30,348
When I had to run our place
after the war, tara,

995
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:31,883
I planted onions.

996
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,419
I didn't know beans
about growing things,

997
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:37,989
So I dug up some when
the tops started to brown.

998
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,790
I figured they would rot.

999
00:54:39,858 --> 00:54:42,077
They didn't have bite
to them at all.

1000
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,161
You want these.
They're good onions.

1001
00:54:44,229 --> 00:54:47,665
Well, what can you
tell me about celery?

1002
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:49,200
I have an uncommon

1003
00:54:49,268 --> 00:54:53,137
If not downright unnatural
adoration for celery.

1004
00:54:53,205 --> 00:54:55,306
Celery was too fancy
for us.

1005
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:57,926
I had a dozen mouths
to feed.

1006
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,912
Ask me about yams, though,
or white potatoes, turnips,

1007
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:02,013
Or cotton-

1008
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,381
You worked the fields?

1009
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,615
We had to eat.

1010
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:05,816
Weaved grass baskets.

1011
00:55:05,884 --> 00:55:08,386
I'll just go have
look at those baskets.

1012
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:10,255
I hear charleston's
famous for its basketry.

1013
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:11,806
How much
is that?

1014
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:12,840
That's $4.00.

1015
00:55:12,908 --> 00:55:14,342
I just love
those.

1016
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,412
I missed out
on the darn sausage.

1017
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,781
That girl is just about
altogether lacking

1018
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:22,918
In anything that would
pass for an education.

1019
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:25,320
She's got the taste
of a hottentot,

1020
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:29,808
But she's got vigor
and strength and brains.

1021
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,342
She's a survivor.

1022
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,979
We need her kind
in the south, eleanor,

1023
00:55:34,046 --> 00:55:35,997
Even in charleston,

1024
00:55:36,064 --> 00:55:38,032
Maybe especially
in charleston.

1025
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,635
I'm going
to sponsor her.

1026
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:43,772
I tried your recipe
for peach cobbler.

1027
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,842
Scarlett, we have a rather important matter

1028
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:48,877
We'd like to
discuss with you.

1029
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,412
What's that, aunt pauline?

1030
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,946
Concerning your
grandfather robillard.

1031
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:52,947
Incidentally-

1032
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:54,249
What about him?

1033
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:55,784
It's come
to our attention

1034
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,487
That you haven't
written him for years.

1035
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:00,021
Why should I write him?

1036
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:03,592
He's a crabby, mean old man
who's never helped me.

1037
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:07,496
We were hoping you might
come with us to savannah...

1038
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:08,997
For the celebration party.

1039
00:56:09,064 --> 00:56:11,032
What celebration party?

1040
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,567
Father's birthday.

1041
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:17,672
Well, I guess you'll just have
to do that celebrating without me.

1042
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,708
Regardless of your
personal feelings,

1043
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,743
You might consider
the question

1044
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,778
Of respect
for one's elders.

1045
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:25,313
And family loyalty.

1046
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,314
Duty.

1047
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,849
And good manners.

1048
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,885
Don't you dare preach
over me.

1049
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:32,420
I don't care a fig
for grandfather robillard.

1050
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:34,789
He was horrid to mother
and to me.

1051
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:35,991
You know I'm right.

1052
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:37,525
He treats everybody
like dirt,

1053
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:39,060
Including you,
his own daughters.

1054
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:40,929
Father's sometimes
less than gracious.

1055
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,264
Father has
his shortcomings.

1056
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:43,798
That cannot be gainsaid,

1057
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:46,167
But he is our father
nonetheless.

1058
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:47,202
Nonetheless.

1059
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,737
And nonetheless,
I won't be in savannah

1060
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:51,773
Watching him
blow out his candles.

1061
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,775
What I said
she'd say.

1062
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:55,310
It's what you say.

1063
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,193
Can you spare a bouquet for
my hall table, mr. Butler?

1064
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,211
Take you'll pick,
miss brewton.

1065
00:57:14,279 --> 00:57:17,048
Heh heh heh.

1066
00:57:17,115 --> 00:57:19,717
Ahh, flowers.

1067
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:20,752
Ha ha.

1068
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,621
You, sir, are a caution.

1069
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:30,428
You and me
go way back, rhett.

1070
00:57:30,496 --> 00:57:32,797
Tell me just what
exactly is going on

1071
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:35,016
Between you and
that amazing girl.

1072
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,550
What makes you
think that?

1073
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:38,086
Your mother told me

1074
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:40,955
That scarlett was less
than charitable to you

1075
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:42,891
Concerning the death
of your child.

1076
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,727
If I hadn't wanted
bonnie to ride that young,

1077
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,596
She wouldn't
have been on a horse.

1078
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:50,865
If she hadn't
been on a horse,

1079
00:57:50,933 --> 00:57:53,518
She wouldn't
have been jumping it.

1080
00:57:53,585 --> 00:57:55,887
If she hadn't
been jumping it,

1081
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,272
She'd still be alive.

1082
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:59,975
There were several
remarks to that effect.

1083
00:58:00,042 --> 00:58:01,409
That was
obviously grief

1084
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:03,444
Turned upside down
and backwards.

1085
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:05,479
She's put it back
together now.

1086
00:58:05,547 --> 00:58:08,216
Why else would
she be in charleston,

1087
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:09,717
Except to show you that?

1088
00:58:09,785 --> 00:58:13,922
She's here because she refuses
to believe our marriage is over.

1089
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:17,125
This marriage shouldn't
have occurred at all.

1090
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,393
She'd been married
twice before.

1091
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:21,529
She married me
for my money.

1092
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:23,264
She admitted that.

1093
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:25,066
She was madly in love
with ashley wilkes.

1094
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,101
Why did you marry her?

1095
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:30,872
Because she was unlike
any woman I had ever known-

1096
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,874
Passionate, infuriating.

1097
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,611
Ahh, I fell
in love with her

1098
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,148
The moment
I laid eyes on her...

1099
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:42,183
Kind of disease,
I suppose.

1100
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,752
Now ashley wilkes
is a free man

1101
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,788
And would marry scarlett
in an instant.

1102
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:48,590
And I want to
be rid of her.

1103
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:51,693
That only makes her
more determined to have me.

1104
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,627
Heh heh.

1105
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,480
I'm afraid it might
all happen again.

1106
00:58:55,547 --> 00:58:57,465
She's...

1107
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:59,000
Heartless.

1108
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,034
She's selfish.

1109
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:03,071
She's like a child
who cries for a toy

1110
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,139
And then breaks it,
but...

1111
00:59:07,626 --> 00:59:09,661
There are moments...

1112
00:59:09,745 --> 00:59:14,833
There are moments that I come
close to forgetting what I know.

1113
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,401
Well, maybe
she'll change.

1114
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:20,554
When pigs fly, my dear.

1115
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,838
Dunmore landing
coming up now.

1116
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:45,329
Isn't it perfectly stunning?

1117
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,054
I'll give you $50,000
in gold-

1118
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:55,489
I beg your pardon?

1119
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,091
If you'll go away.

1120
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:58,076
Go away?

1121
00:59:58,143 --> 00:59:59,577
A handsome deal, scarlett,

1122
00:59:59,644 --> 01:00:02,430
A fortune bigger
than you'd ever hoped for,

1123
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,631
A king's ransom.

1124
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:05,833
The king being you,
I guess.

1125
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:09,904
It's funny you should offer
me what you call a deal.

1126
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:11,072
What's funny about it?

1127
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:12,474
I came to offer one.

1128
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:15,276
I shudder to think what
your mind might concoct.

1129
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,845
Why don't you just listen
through all that shuddering?

1130
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:21,182
I'm offering for you to
stop acting so hateful to me,

1131
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,818
To act nice and help me
have a good time

1132
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:26,020
Through
the social season

1133
01:00:26,088 --> 01:00:27,889
Like a happy
married couple.

1134
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,390
After the season,
I'll leave.

1135
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:30,925
Without the money?

1136
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,460
With the money,
of course.

1137
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,461
That's no deal.

1138
01:00:33,528 --> 01:00:35,496
There's nothing
in it for me.

1139
01:00:35,564 --> 01:00:39,067
You'll take the money to
leave, but you don't leave.

1140
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:40,234
How do I benefit?

1141
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:41,602
I don't stay forever.

1142
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,638
I don't tell your mother
what a skunk you are.

1143
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:45,740
Hmm.

1144
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,810
I think we might
be able to do business.

1145
01:00:49,878 --> 01:00:52,263
I'm always
willing to dicker.

1146
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:53,447
You confide in mother

1147
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:55,683
That however much
you adore me,

1148
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:57,217
I snore incorrigibly
and unbearably,

1149
01:00:57,285 --> 01:01:00,788
A misfortune requiring us to
sleep in separate bedrooms.

1150
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:02,807
After
the saint cecilia ball,

1151
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:05,009
You'll express an urgent,
irresistible desire

1152
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:06,377
To rush back to atlanta,

1153
01:01:06,444 --> 01:01:10,031
Where you will immediately
engage the services of a lawyer

1154
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:11,733
To negotiate
a legal separation.

1155
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,636
You will never again
set foot in charleston.

1156
01:01:14,703 --> 01:01:17,939
You'll never write or
otherwise communicate with me.

1157
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,075
Swear you'll be nice
before I leave?

1158
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:21,209
Word of honor.

1159
01:01:21,276 --> 01:01:24,078
Lacking a bible,
that will have to do.

1160
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:26,564
If you turn mean,
you broke the deal,

1161
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:28,233
And I don't
have to leave.

1162
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,001
I still get the money.

1163
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:31,202
Done.

1164
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,888
You're a right trial in
the husband department,

1165
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:36,223
But it's nice
doing business with you.

1166
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:40,745
I don't suppose you'd reconsider that
aspect concerning separate bedrooms?

1167
01:01:48,503 --> 01:01:52,173
Girl can't
have everything.

1168
01:02:54,903 --> 01:02:56,371
Thank you, sir.

1169
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,116
10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15,

1170
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:10,885
16, 17...

1171
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:12,052
18.

1172
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,621
There you are,
ma'am.

1173
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,322
Thank you.

1174
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:18,192
Hi, rhett.

1175
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,628
Well, now, here's
a happy surprise.

1176
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:24,699
Ooh, darlin', I was just
hoping I would run into you.

1177
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,166
And so you have.

1178
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:28,336
How have
you been, luli?

1179
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,721
Just fine
and dandy, rhett.

1180
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:31,138
When you coming back
to atlanta?

1181
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:34,375
I never know when I
might run up there.

1182
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:38,395
It could be I'll be here in
charleston if belle wants.

1183
01:03:38,463 --> 01:03:41,315
You don't say.
And why's that?

1184
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:42,383
Business.

1185
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,685
Yours?

1186
01:03:43,752 --> 01:03:46,921
Mine's the only kind of
business I know, ain't it?

1187
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:49,557
Exploring new frontiers
of commerce, are you?

1188
01:03:49,624 --> 01:03:51,659
Mmm...You might say.

1189
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:54,745
Belle's opening
a whorehouse.

1190
01:03:54,813 --> 01:03:56,714
You might say that, too.

1191
01:03:56,781 --> 01:04:00,201
You're here just in time for the big race,

1192
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:03,237
Horse race I'm running day after tomorrow.

1193
01:04:03,305 --> 01:04:05,906
Why the hell you runnin'
a horse race?

1194
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:08,142
I love horse racing.
Can we go?

1195
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,944
What horse race?

1196
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,281
I won a fine quarter horse in a card game.

1197
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:15,950
The loser suggested
he'd race me for it.

1198
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,653
If he wins, he
gets his horse back.

1199
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,322
If I win,
I keep the horse

1200
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,924
And take his
other one as well.

1201
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:24,158
Why?

1202
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:26,894
Why don't you just settle
for what you already won?

1203
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,729
Why are you in charleston?

1204
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,798
Touch.

1205
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:33,901
She told you. She's
opening a whorehouse.

1206
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:36,287
Ha ha ha!

1207
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,449
Don't let me down
now, rhett.

1208
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,451
I bet the mortgage
on you.

1209
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:51,919
Don't tell the missis,
jake.

1210
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:54,055
Don't make me have to.

1211
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,058
Good morning.

1212
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,392
Hello, mr. Butler.

1213
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,794
Who you betting on?

1214
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,030
I'm not the betting sort.

1215
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:05,533
I thought horse racing was
always around and around.

1216
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,235
No, not this kind.
This kind is straight.

1217
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:11,139
I thought it would
be around and around.

1218
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:12,640
Mother.

1219
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:15,977
Yoo-hoo, rhett!

1220
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,913
Are my eyes
deceiving me,

1221
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,848
Or is that
belle watling?

1222
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:21,749
Morning, belle.

1223
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:22,750
Hello.

1224
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:23,884
Luli.

1225
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:26,420
Ladies, may I introduce miss belle watling

1226
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:27,955
And
miss luli harris.

1227
01:05:28,022 --> 01:05:30,257
My mother, belle,
mrs. Butler senior.

1228
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:31,425
How do?

1229
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:34,695
I don't believe you've
ever met my wife scarlett.

1230
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:37,265
I know miss watling
by reputation.

1231
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:40,067
Glad to make your
acquaintance, mrs. Butler.

1232
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:41,302
Heard lots about you.

1233
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,571
I don't expect you
came from atlanta

1234
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,307
To see rhett race a horse, miss watling.

1235
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:49,643
I wouldn't travel
6 feet to watch that.

1236
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:52,747
Actually, I'm here on, uh,
business, truth be told.

1237
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,248
Oh, I'm so fascinated

1238
01:05:54,316 --> 01:05:56,784
By ladies with
business interests.

1239
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,837
So very unusual, isn't it?

1240
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:02,873
What business are you
engaged in, miss watling,

1241
01:06:02,941 --> 01:06:04,408
If one may know?

1242
01:06:04,476 --> 01:06:08,029
You might say I arrange
social get-togethers.

1243
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:09,663
I see. What exactly-

1244
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,549
Uh, uh, mother...

1245
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:14,919
I believe it's time for the race to start.

1246
01:06:14,986 --> 01:06:17,037
Belle, real good running into you. Luli.

1247
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:18,372
Wish me luck.

1248
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,109
I bet a whole dollar
on you.

1249
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:22,443
Don't disappoint me.

1250
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,244
He seldom does.

1251
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,449
Easy on that
last bend, harry.

1252
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:36,707
Would you care for a mint julep, darling?

1253
01:07:04,802 --> 01:07:06,537
Come on.

1254
01:07:06,604 --> 01:07:07,538
More!

1255
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:08,539
Faster.

1256
01:07:08,606 --> 01:07:09,740
More!

1257
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:41,939
Oh!

1258
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:42,940
Yes!

1259
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:43,941
Whoo!

1260
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:44,942
All right!

1261
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:47,978
Ooh, he sure can ride,
can't he?

1262
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:50,380
I'll say.

1263
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:56,337
Harry.

1264
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:57,638
Congratulations.

1265
01:08:07,132 --> 01:08:09,066
Never a doubt,
my friend.

1266
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:11,202
Never a doubt.

1267
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:13,204
Great job.

1268
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:14,738
Congratulations,
mr. Butler.

1269
01:08:14,806 --> 01:08:16,107
Congratulations.

1270
01:08:16,174 --> 01:08:18,375
Well, thank you so much.

1271
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:20,377
I really
don't believe rhett

1272
01:08:20,445 --> 01:08:22,746
Was in need of two
more horses, though.

1273
01:08:22,814 --> 01:08:25,249
Didn't have a thing
to do with horses.

1274
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:28,252
It had to do
with him winning.

1275
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:58,298
Much too revealing to me.

1276
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:01,035
When you going to stop all
this lollygagging around, sally,

1277
01:09:01,102 --> 01:09:04,071
And accept my oft repeated
proposals of matrimony?

1278
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:06,607
Maxwell, if
I've told you once,

1279
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,609
I've told you
more than twice,

1280
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,645
Two marriages
were enough for me.

1281
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:12,146
It's nothing personal.

1282
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:13,280
Third time lucky.

1283
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:14,314
Says who?

1284
01:09:14,382 --> 01:09:15,816
When I mentioned

1285
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:17,885
I'd recently
made your acquaintance,

1286
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,220
Daddy said
you had a reputation

1287
01:09:20,288 --> 01:09:22,590
Of some considerable
notoriety during the war.

1288
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,192
Wonder what he could
have been referring to.

1289
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,994
Are you teasing me?

1290
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,829
I made me some money,

1291
01:09:28,897 --> 01:09:32,066
And I had me some fun,
miss hampton.

1292
01:09:37,472 --> 01:09:40,441
Did you come
in my room last night?

1293
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:41,442
No.

1294
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:42,443
You're lying.

1295
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:43,644
Why would I lie?

1296
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,145
I must have dreamt it.

1297
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:47,682
Some random nocturnal
fever overcame you,

1298
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:50,017
No doubt, giving rise
to visions.

1299
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:53,054
Did you come
to my room last night?

1300
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:54,622
Yes.

1301
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:59,627
I expect your
dance card's full.

1302
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,795
I threw it away.

1303
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,163
I'm not dancing
with anyone but you.

1304
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:05,700
We'll be hearing the
crack of breaking hearts

1305
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:06,867
All over the ballroom.

1306
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:09,570
There's only one
I want to hear breaking.

1307
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:10,571
Pity.

1308
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,106
You're a skunk.

1309
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:20,247
It was by far the very
best ball of the season.

1310
01:10:20,315 --> 01:10:22,750
And the last.

1311
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,752
That's your way
of reminding me

1312
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,253
Our agreement
has concluded,

1313
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:28,255
As if I
needed reminding.

1314
01:10:28,323 --> 01:10:31,258
I don't want to talk
about that tonight.

1315
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:33,260
We'll talk
about it tomorrow.

1316
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:37,197
Your mother mentioned your
being in new orleans recently.

1317
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:38,699
For a short while.

1318
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,769
Did being there bring
to mind our honeymoon?

1319
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:45,706
Sure it did.

1320
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:47,441
That's something, anyway.

1321
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:53,714
Is your boat
out there somewhere?

1322
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:54,782
Mm-hmm.

1323
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,785
Does it have a name?

1324
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:00,788
<i>Bonnie.</i>

1325
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:04,792
I suppose I might
have guessed that.

1326
01:11:07,295 --> 01:11:09,229
I've never been sailing.

1327
01:11:09,297 --> 01:11:11,231
What's it like?

1328
01:11:11,299 --> 01:11:12,733
It's wonderful.

1329
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,234
I'll bet it is.

1330
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:15,803
I've never been.

1331
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,238
All right.

1332
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:20,240
All right,
just this once.

1333
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,309
As adam said to eve.

1334
01:11:35,657 --> 01:11:39,026
I've never had
so much fun in my life.

1335
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:41,061
Well, more or less.

1336
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:46,099
Bring it about, mate.

1337
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:54,858
Ha ha ha!

1338
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,222
We don't want to tangle

1339
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,291
With that
kind of weather.

1340
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,393
Here. Take the tiller.

1341
01:12:13,461 --> 01:12:14,895
This!

1342
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,764
I'll drop the jib.

1343
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,409
Hold your course, mate!

1344
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:17,524
Start bailing!

1345
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:22,029
Bail out the water!

1346
01:13:30,304 --> 01:13:33,673
Rhett!

1347
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:40,680
Scarlett!

1348
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,752
Scarlett!

1349
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,088
Hold on!

1350
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:12,306
Don't die on me,
scarlett.

1351
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:14,674
Please...

1352
01:15:14,742 --> 01:15:16,310
Don't die on me.

1353
01:16:31,702 --> 01:16:35,005
Come on.

1354
01:16:35,073 --> 01:16:38,308
Come on. Come back
to me, scarlett.

1355
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:40,510
Don't go.

1356
01:16:40,578 --> 01:16:42,512
Don't go, scarlett.

1357
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,114
Don't go.

1358
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,773
Oh, scarlett!

1359
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,412
I thought you were gone.

1360
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,666
I wasn't dreaming
this time, was I?

1361
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,668
Here. Take some of this.

1362
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,737
It's just rotgut.
It'll warm you.

1363
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,104
I don't need it.

1364
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:00,874
I've never been warmer
in my life.

1365
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,693
Listen to me, now.

1366
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,278
For the rest of my life.

1367
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:06,280
What happened...

1368
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:10,233
Ahh, it was, um...

1369
01:18:10,301 --> 01:18:13,820
It was a celebration
of survival.

1370
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:17,791
Nothing more.

1371
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,793
You're saying that
'cause...

1372
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,796
That's all
you want it to be,

1373
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,766
But what happened
was your true heart,

1374
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:29,169
Your true heart...

1375
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,738
You love me.

1376
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:33,740
I know you do.

1377
01:18:33,808 --> 01:18:37,210
You love me.

1378
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:31,315
Pansy?

1379
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:34,234
Pansy.

1380
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,169
Oh, miss scarlett,

1381
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:37,704
You woke up.

1382
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:40,273
You been sleeping
the longest time.

1383
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,708
How long?

1384
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:43,443
What time is it?

1385
01:19:44,411 --> 01:19:45,829
How is she?

1386
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:48,448
Well, she woke up
just this minute.

1387
01:19:48,516 --> 01:19:49,882
Oh, thank goodness.

1388
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,117
Oh, honey.

1389
01:19:51,185 --> 01:19:52,152
Miss eleanor...

1390
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,188
Ohh.

1391
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:56,723
How long
have I been sleeping?

1392
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:57,724
Oh...

1393
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:58,758
Where's rhett?

1394
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:00,294
Oh, you've been sleeping

1395
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:02,162
Nearly 24 hours, dearest.

1396
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,663
How do you feel?

1397
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:05,031
Jehoshaphat.

1398
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:06,400
24 hours?

1399
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:10,304
How could anybody
sleep that long?

1400
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:12,339
You had quite an ordeal.

1401
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,040
Don't you remember?

1402
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:17,143
Most of it, I guess.

1403
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:19,813
Where's rhett?

1404
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,748
Pansy...

1405
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:24,184
Tell mr. Rhett
that sleeping beauty

1406
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,720
Is back from
the land of nod.

1407
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:28,255
Well, maybe not so beauty...

1408
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,591
If I look as bad
as I feel.

1409
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:31,625
Oh.

1410
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:33,126
I'm feeling dreadful.

1411
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,912
Well, I don't believe
mr. Rhett here...

1412
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:36,863
Right now.

1413
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:38,898
Pansy, go down
to the kitchen

1414
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:41,401
And bring some broth up
for miss scarlett.

1415
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,970
And some tea.

1416
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:44,904
The doctor's
been by several times,

1417
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,840
And he's given
every assurance

1418
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:48,308
About your condition.

1419
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,944
And he says
he wants you to rest

1420
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,678
For another day or two.

1421
01:20:52,746 --> 01:20:54,214
Is rhett all right?

1422
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:55,415
Rhett's fine.

1423
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,419
I've got the most
splitting headache.

1424
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:02,588
Will he be back soon?

1425
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,859
Go on, miss eleanor.

1426
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,495
It's just like
the poets say.

1427
01:21:10,864 --> 01:21:12,465
Sometimes...

1428
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:15,535
Out of the darkest
danger and fear

1429
01:21:15,602 --> 01:21:18,838
Comes the most beautiful
and dazzling night.

1430
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:23,343
We almost lost our lives.

1431
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,378
And in that near losing,

1432
01:21:25,446 --> 01:21:27,881
We found each other
at last.

1433
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:29,716
Oh, scarlett.

1434
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:35,806
What's the matter?

1435
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:40,193
Rhett is all right,
isn't he?

1436
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:43,263
You're not lying to me,
are you?

1437
01:21:47,468 --> 01:21:48,801
What's this?

1438
01:21:50,871 --> 01:21:51,872
From rhett?

1439
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:57,277
Shall I leave you alone for a bit?

1440
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,630
<i>Scarlett...</i>

1441
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:21,201
<i>There's nothing I can say
about what happened yesterday,</i>

1442
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,236
<i>Except that
I'm profoundly ashamed</i>

1443
01:22:23,304 --> 01:22:26,306
<i>And sorry
to have been the cause</i>

1444
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:28,841
<i>Of such pain
and danger for you</i>

1445
01:22:28,909 --> 01:22:31,011
<i>And regret bitterly
all that occurred</i>

1446
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,546
<i>After our escape.</i>

1447
01:22:32,613 --> 01:22:34,914
<i>My actions
were reprehensible.</i>

1448
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,383
<i>I cannot, however,</i>

1449
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,452
<i>Deny now the truth
of anything I said</i>

1450
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,654
<i>In the aftermath
of our...</i>

1451
01:22:41,722 --> 01:22:45,392
<i>Ill-advised
and reckless encounter.</i>

1452
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:49,962
<i>I must not and will not
ever see you again.</i>

1453
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,464
<i>Naturally I cannot remain</i>

1454
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:54,100
<i>In the environs
of charleston.</i>

1455
01:22:54,168 --> 01:22:56,135
<i>The cash settlement
I promised</i>

1456
01:22:56,203 --> 01:22:58,672
<i>Will be transferred to you
immediately</i>

1457
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:01,741
<i>In care of henry hamilton
in atlanta.</i>

1458
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:04,877
<i>I ask you to accept
my sincere apologies</i>

1459
01:23:04,945 --> 01:23:07,447
<i>For everything
about our lives together.</i>

1460
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,982
<i>It was not meant to be.</i>

1461
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:12,686
<i>I wish you
a happier future.</i>

1462
01:23:15,656 --> 01:23:18,607
Miss scarlett,
a messenger just came by.

1463
01:23:28,252 --> 01:23:30,720
Delighted as I am to
hear your news, ashley,

1464
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:32,205
I naturally
would've preferred

1465
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:36,309
It had been a visit to me
that brought you to charleston

1466
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:38,411
Instead of some
darned business matter.

1467
01:23:38,478 --> 01:23:41,347
Dare I say
my business here

1468
01:23:41,415 --> 01:23:43,683
Is more excuse for my
presence than reason for it?

1469
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:47,753
You're not rake enough to say
such a thing to a lady, ashley.

1470
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:49,789
Not and get away
with it.

1471
01:23:49,856 --> 01:23:52,125
I sometimes
so wish I were...

1472
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,160
Rake enough.

1473
01:23:53,227 --> 01:23:54,694
You've heard
the saying

1474
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:56,730
About leopards
and spots, I guess.

1475
01:23:56,797 --> 01:23:57,964
Alas, yes.

1476
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:59,199
Alas nothing.

1477
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,602
What you are is wonderful and fine, ashley.

1478
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:05,822
You have no cause whatsoever
for regret about it.

1479
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,857
It's what
I loved you for.

1480
01:24:07,925 --> 01:24:11,477
And made a ninny of myself
for, if truth be told,

1481
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,047
And I guess it has to be sometimes.

1482
01:24:14,114 --> 01:24:16,499
If rhett butler
had just a smidgen

1483
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:18,251
Of your character
and dignity-

1484
01:24:18,269 --> 01:24:21,104
How's rhett? That's the first
mention you've made of him.

1485
01:24:21,171 --> 01:24:23,106
Does a leopard
change his spots

1486
01:24:23,173 --> 01:24:25,692
For a stripe
down his back?

1487
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,593
Are there difficulties?
I thought-

1488
01:24:27,661 --> 01:24:29,696
He's left me, ashley.

1489
01:24:29,763 --> 01:24:32,766
For good and all
this time, I guess.

1490
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,819
I'm so very sorry,
my dear.

1491
01:24:35,887 --> 01:24:38,855
A minute ago you said
you brought a surprise,

1492
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:41,391
As if your being here
wasn't surprise enough.

1493
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:46,062
I won't tolerate being kept in
suspense for one minute longer.

1494
01:24:47,164 --> 01:24:49,165
I brought you
some photographs.

1495
01:24:49,233 --> 01:24:51,167
I'll just go
and get them.

1496
01:24:51,235 --> 01:24:52,702
I'll only
be a moment.

1497
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,237
Don't be silly.

1498
01:24:54,305 --> 01:24:56,839
Save you a trip.
I'll come on up.

1499
01:24:56,907 --> 01:24:58,391
You really
think you should?

1500
01:24:58,458 --> 01:24:59,809
Fiddle-dee-dee.

1501
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:01,844
I've spent
the past two months

1502
01:25:01,912 --> 01:25:03,380
Trying to do
what's expected

1503
01:25:03,447 --> 01:25:05,948
Of a proper charlestonian
nose-in-the-air lady.

1504
01:25:06,016 --> 01:25:08,985
What I have to conclude
is they're them, I'm me,

1505
01:25:09,052 --> 01:25:11,837
And never
the twain's gonna meet.

1506
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:16,826
I hope the accommodations in this
hotel are worthy of you, ashley.

1507
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:18,845
I'm quite content so far.

1508
01:25:22,866 --> 01:25:24,251
They're perfectly
wonderful, ashley.

1509
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:28,020
I can hardly wait
to see them real.

1510
01:25:28,088 --> 01:25:31,458
Of course the photographs
don't quite do them justice.

1511
01:25:31,525 --> 01:25:33,009
They're such fine homes.

1512
01:25:33,077 --> 01:25:34,510
They've enhanced
big sam's reputation

1513
01:25:34,578 --> 01:25:35,979
In the building trades.

1514
01:25:36,046 --> 01:25:38,014
You can be sure of that.

1515
01:25:38,082 --> 01:25:40,583
And how about your reputation
in the lumber trades?

1516
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:44,103
I've got almost more
demand than I can supply.

1517
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:46,939
I'm so tickled-pink
for you, ashley.

1518
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:49,709
Will you be coming back
to atlanta, scarlett?

1519
01:25:51,162 --> 01:25:52,645
I haven't quite decided

1520
01:25:52,713 --> 01:25:55,348
On my next
course of life.

1521
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:58,467
I wish you'd
come back to atlanta.

1522
01:25:58,535 --> 01:26:00,353
Do you?

1523
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,921
Very much.

1524
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:07,293
Very much.

1525
01:26:14,835 --> 01:26:17,520
I think maybe I've got about 10 seconds

1526
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:20,073
To get myself
out of this room.

1527
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:21,024
Scarlett...

1528
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,658
5...

1529
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:31,784
Scarlett...

1530
01:26:31,852 --> 01:26:33,353
This is charleston.

1531
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:34,821
And you are,
ostensibly,

1532
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,256
A lady.

1533
01:26:36,323 --> 01:26:38,691
A lady does not
accompany a man

1534
01:26:38,758 --> 01:26:40,226
To his hotel room.

1535
01:26:40,294 --> 01:26:42,761
And certainly not
in the broad light of day.

1536
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:45,764
And most certainly
not in charleston.

1537
01:26:45,832 --> 01:26:48,801
Did this person who saw
me going up the stairs,

1538
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:50,336
Whoever she is,

1539
01:26:50,404 --> 01:26:52,872
Since you refuse
to divulge her identity,

1540
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:54,407
Did this person
observe me

1541
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,976
Coming back down the
stairs 10 minutes later?

1542
01:26:57,044 --> 01:27:00,113
I'd need more time than
that to unlace my shoes,

1543
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,564
Much less my corsets.

1544
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,599
Scarlett, don't.

1545
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,284
You're being vulgar.

1546
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:07,971
I'm sorry.

1547
01:27:09,506 --> 01:27:13,159
But you are no longer
welcome in this house.

1548
01:27:14,695 --> 01:27:17,079
Well,
that suits me just fine.

1549
01:27:17,147 --> 01:27:20,116
'cause this is
no longer a house

1550
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:23,253
In which I care
to be welcome.

1551
01:27:57,371 --> 01:27:58,837
Oh, my lord.

1552
01:27:58,905 --> 01:28:00,439
Is that me?

1553
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,843
How can that be me?

1554
01:28:05,512 --> 01:28:06,980
What am I doing?

1555
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:09,482
What have I done to myself?

1556
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:13,619
Is that cowardly
disgusting creature

1557
01:28:13,687 --> 01:28:15,155
Scarlett o'hara?

1558
01:28:15,222 --> 01:28:17,189
No, it is not.

1559
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:20,293
Scarlett o'hara
doesn't drown her sorrows.

1560
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:22,212
Scarlett o'hara
doesn't hide away

1561
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:24,397
And hope for
what she wants.

1562
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:28,901
Scarlett o'hara goes out
and gets what she wants.

1563
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:30,203
You coward.

1564
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:32,922
Coward!

1565
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,822
This here for
miss robillard.

1566
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,958
Which of 'em?

1567
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:53,026
Whichever.

1568
01:28:56,747 --> 01:28:59,716
Eulalie!

1569
01:28:59,783 --> 01:29:01,184
Scarlett's changed her mind!

1570
01:29:01,251 --> 01:29:04,153
She's going
to savannah with us!

1571
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,610
Ohh.

1572
01:29:38,405 --> 01:29:40,006
Oh, my lord.

1573
01:29:42,209 --> 01:29:43,542
Oh, lord.

1574
01:29:44,744 --> 01:29:45,745
Yes.

1575
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:50,483
Yes.

1576
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:53,736
<i>Well, I guess life's</i>

1577
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:56,789
<i>Just a long game of chance
after all,</i>

1578
01:29:56,856 --> 01:29:58,241
<i>Isn't it,
mr. Rhett butler?</i>

1579
01:29:58,308 --> 01:30:00,743
<i>That's what a gambling man
like you would say,</i>

1580
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:01,877
<i>Isn't it?</i>

1581
01:30:01,945 --> 01:30:03,912
<i>And you think
you've won it</i>

1582
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,914
<i>And walked away
from the table</i>

1583
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:07,450
<i>Leaving me high and dry.</i>

1584
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:09,485
<i>Well, you'll be
thinking again</i>

1585
01:30:09,553 --> 01:30:11,487
<i>One of these days,
won't you?</i>

1586
01:30:11,555 --> 01:30:13,021
<i>You surely will.</i>

1587
01:30:13,089 --> 01:30:15,057
<i>Maybe you don't want me,</i>

1588
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:17,593
<i>But I've got something now
you do want...</i>

1589
01:30:17,661 --> 01:30:18,761
<i>Always wanted.</i>

1590
01:30:18,828 --> 01:30:21,297
<i>The ace
is up my sleeve now,</i>

1591
01:30:21,365 --> 01:30:24,133
<i>And I'll play it
when the time's right</i>

1592
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,568
<i>When I'm good and ready.</i>

1593
01:30:25,636 --> 01:30:27,770
<i>You'll be willing
to walk barefoot</i>

1594
01:30:27,837 --> 01:30:31,374
<i>Over hot coals
to come back to me.</i>

1595
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:33,776
<i>We were always two pieces
of the one thing,</i>

1596
01:30:33,843 --> 01:30:35,177
<i>My darling rhett.</i>

1597
01:30:35,245 --> 01:30:36,679
<i>Now we're three.</i>

1598
01:31:23,793 --> 01:31:26,845
God's nightgown!
Who'd have thought

1599
01:31:26,912 --> 01:31:29,131
I'd ever set foot
in savannah again?

1600
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:32,067
Father will be thrilled
to pieces that you have.

1601
01:31:32,135 --> 01:31:33,402
To pieces.

1602
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:36,238
You know what pa used to
say about grandfather-

1603
01:31:36,356 --> 01:31:39,208
Pierre robillard wouldn't
give you the time of day

1604
01:31:39,275 --> 01:31:41,076
If your watch was broke.

1605
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:43,045
Even mother laughed at that.

1606
01:31:43,112 --> 01:31:46,131
She couldn't deny it, not
even about her own father.

1607
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:48,167
I suppose
father never was

1608
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:51,470
Very fond of gerald
o'hara, if truth be told.

1609
01:31:51,538 --> 01:31:55,023
At least I can see
my other kin while I'm here.

1610
01:31:55,091 --> 01:31:56,458
What kin is that?

1611
01:31:56,526 --> 01:31:57,726
My o'hara kin.

1612
01:31:57,877 --> 01:32:00,779
Perhaps you better not
make note of that intention

1613
01:32:00,846 --> 01:32:02,363
To your grandfather,
scarlett.

1614
01:32:02,431 --> 01:32:03,882
Perhaps not.

1615
01:32:13,893 --> 01:32:16,829
Will mind your manners,
won't you, scarlett?

1616
01:32:16,896 --> 01:32:19,697
Father is quite old and considerably frail.

1617
01:32:19,765 --> 01:32:20,733
Considerably.

1618
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,168
Wouldn't do to tax
his declining strength

1619
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:25,703
With your sometimes-
how shall I put it-

1620
01:32:25,771 --> 01:32:27,239
Quite forthright manner.

1621
01:32:27,306 --> 01:32:29,508
Will it be necessary
to genuflect

1622
01:32:29,575 --> 01:32:31,309
When he grants me
audience?

1623
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:33,345
That's what I'm talking
about, scarlett.

1624
01:32:33,412 --> 01:32:35,880
You are just being
naughty on purpose.

1625
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:37,349
On purpose.

1626
01:32:42,021 --> 01:32:44,072
Well, jerome, we're here.

1627
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,273
We're here.

1628
01:32:45,341 --> 01:32:48,310
Welcome again to savannah and home, ma'am.

1629
01:32:48,377 --> 01:32:49,344
Thank you.

1630
01:32:49,412 --> 01:32:51,730
Jerome, this is
our niece, mrs. Butler.

1631
01:32:51,797 --> 01:32:54,265
Yes, I remember
miz butler.

1632
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:55,734
How are you, jerome?

1633
01:32:55,801 --> 01:32:57,769
I'm well and fine,
ma'am,

1634
01:32:57,837 --> 01:32:59,938
And hopin' the same
for yourself.

1635
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:02,223
Jerome!

1636
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,792
Is that them come?

1637
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,879
The mister's had his
sleeping chamber relocated

1638
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:09,848
To the parlor floor
of the house, ma'am.

1639
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:14,886
The staircase had become a
considerable trial for him to manage.

1640
01:33:14,954 --> 01:33:16,337
Jerome!

1641
01:33:16,405 --> 01:33:19,307
Yes, sir, mister,
coming right along now.

1642
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:22,494
Doesn't sound all that frail to me.

1643
01:33:23,963 --> 01:33:26,831
He's asking for you now,
dearest.

1644
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,368
I'll be just a minute,
aunt eulie.

1645
01:33:29,435 --> 01:33:32,537
He could scarcely believe
that you were here.

1646
01:33:32,605 --> 01:33:34,572
I can scarcely
believe it myself.

1647
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,025
You will be nice now,
won't you, scarlett?

1648
01:33:37,093 --> 01:33:39,060
I will, aunt eulie,
I promise.

1649
01:33:39,128 --> 01:33:41,095
Oh, bless you.

1650
01:33:42,265 --> 01:33:45,733
I don't know why I'm
caring how I look anyhow.

1651
01:33:45,801 --> 01:33:48,803
He's probably blind
as a bat by now.

1652
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:50,838
I'll try
to keep my promise,

1653
01:33:50,906 --> 01:33:53,675
But if you hear any shooting, it'll be me.

1654
01:34:01,968 --> 01:34:03,402
Hello, grandfather.

1655
01:34:05,438 --> 01:34:07,072
Are you awake?

1656
01:34:09,675 --> 01:34:11,676
It's scarlett,
grandfather.

1657
01:34:16,749 --> 01:34:19,268
I had hoped that,
in time,

1658
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:22,954
You would come to favor less
your father and more your mother.

1659
01:34:23,022 --> 01:34:26,424
I see I am to be disappointed
in that wish.

1660
01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:29,628
I guess so. I'm more o'hara
than robillard, grandfather.

1661
01:34:29,696 --> 01:34:33,031
Always have been,
if I dare say so here.

1662
01:34:33,099 --> 01:34:36,868
I've never known you not
to say whatever you dared.

1663
01:34:36,936 --> 01:34:37,870
Sit.

1664
01:34:37,937 --> 01:34:39,304
I promised aunt eulie

1665
01:34:39,372 --> 01:34:41,439
I'd be
on my best behavior.

1666
01:34:41,507 --> 01:34:43,074
You have grown older.

1667
01:34:43,142 --> 01:34:44,610
So have you.

1668
01:34:44,677 --> 01:34:46,345
But not to such advantage.

1669
01:34:46,412 --> 01:34:47,345
Why, grandfather,

1670
01:34:47,413 --> 01:34:49,380
Am I mishearing a remark

1671
01:34:49,449 --> 01:34:52,417
That sounded so breathtakingly
close to a compliment?

1672
01:34:52,485 --> 01:34:54,786
To what do we owe

1673
01:34:54,854 --> 01:34:58,290
The dubious pleasure of your
presence here in savannah?

1674
01:34:58,358 --> 01:35:00,025
That's more like it.

1675
01:35:00,093 --> 01:35:02,394
Aunt eulalie and aunt pauline invited me

1676
01:35:02,461 --> 01:35:03,896
To celebrate
your birthday.

1677
01:35:03,963 --> 01:35:06,598
It seemed an appropriate
opportunity for me

1678
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:09,434
To attend to a few
other matters here.

1679
01:35:09,502 --> 01:35:11,336
Other matters?

1680
01:35:11,404 --> 01:35:13,838
One personal, the other more like business.

1681
01:35:13,907 --> 01:35:15,073
As to the business-

1682
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:17,008
Have you come
to beg money again?

1683
01:35:17,076 --> 01:35:19,628
I never begged you
for money, grandfather.

1684
01:35:19,695 --> 01:35:23,165
I only asked for a loan
to feed my starving family

1685
01:35:23,233 --> 01:35:24,699
After the yankees
passed through

1686
01:35:24,767 --> 01:35:27,051
Leaving nothing but ruin
and death behind them.

1687
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,621
I got along
without your help.

1688
01:35:29,689 --> 01:35:32,691
I am now a woman
of considerable means.

1689
01:35:32,758 --> 01:35:35,727
And I'm here
to spend some of that

1690
01:35:35,795 --> 01:35:40,298
On what one of my sisters
saw fit to give away.

1691
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:42,834
I would have to wonder

1692
01:35:42,902 --> 01:35:44,335
What it might be

1693
01:35:44,403 --> 01:35:47,906
That your sister
would value so little

1694
01:35:47,973 --> 01:35:50,075
And you so much.

1695
01:35:50,142 --> 01:35:51,476
Tara.

1696
01:35:51,544 --> 01:35:53,512
Ahh-ha ha.
Fabled tara.

1697
01:35:53,579 --> 01:35:55,146
There's no fable
to it.

1698
01:35:55,214 --> 01:35:58,449
It's home.
At least it was

1699
01:35:58,517 --> 01:36:02,237
Till careen decided to give
away her 1/3 share in it.

1700
01:36:02,305 --> 01:36:05,356
Seems she turned severely
religious for some reason.

1701
01:36:05,424 --> 01:36:08,343
It's her intention
to become a nun.

1702
01:36:08,411 --> 01:36:10,678
Careen always was
kind of flighty.

1703
01:36:10,746 --> 01:36:13,297
To be a catholic,
of course,

1704
01:36:13,365 --> 01:36:15,299
Requires
in the first instance

1705
01:36:15,367 --> 01:36:17,802
A certain degree
of mental instability.

1706
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:23,942
You made mention of some personal
reason for your presence here.

1707
01:36:24,009 --> 01:36:27,212
I'm going to search out
my relatives.

1708
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:28,597
Relatives?

1709
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:32,116
I am the last of the
robillard line in savannah.

1710
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:34,152
I know that.
O'haras, I mean.

1711
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,754
Ohh! The peasants?

1712
01:36:35,821 --> 01:36:39,190
Maybe some of pa's
brothers are still alive.

1713
01:36:39,258 --> 01:36:41,993
Pa would like it
if he knew

1714
01:36:42,061 --> 01:36:44,663
I was looking up
my long-lost kin.

1715
01:36:44,731 --> 01:36:48,299
Did you really hate pa
as much as he said?

1716
01:36:48,368 --> 01:36:51,335
When my youngest and
most cherished daughter

1717
01:36:51,403 --> 01:36:54,373
Wed herself
to gerald o'hara,

1718
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,908
There was
no visible bottom

1719
01:36:56,976 --> 01:36:59,978
To the pit
of disastrous folly

1720
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:02,514
Into which she flung
both herself

1721
01:37:02,582 --> 01:37:05,516
And the honorable name
of robillard.

1722
01:37:06,553 --> 01:37:09,221
I guess pa wasn't
exaggerating.

1723
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:13,891
May I ask who it was

1724
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:16,261
Witnessed this supposed
indiscretion on scarlett's part?

1725
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:18,830
Supposed? She was seen
entering the drummond hotel

1726
01:37:18,897 --> 01:37:22,867
With a man she herself later admitted
to my mother was ashley wilkes.

1727
01:37:22,935 --> 01:37:26,371
As for who saw them,
my mother declined to say.

1728
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:28,406
And did
this nameless accuser

1729
01:37:28,474 --> 01:37:30,408
Also peek
through the keyhole?

1730
01:37:30,476 --> 01:37:33,378
You don't have to take this
too seriously, sally.

1731
01:37:33,446 --> 01:37:34,713
How do you know

1732
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:37,248
That what went on between
scarlett and wilkes

1733
01:37:37,317 --> 01:37:38,617
Is what you're
thinking?

1734
01:37:38,685 --> 01:37:40,485
That's a considerably
naive idea

1735
01:37:40,553 --> 01:37:42,521
Coming from someone
of your experience.

1736
01:37:42,588 --> 01:37:43,955
Naive, hell.
It's fair.

1737
01:37:44,023 --> 01:37:46,525
Since when has scarlett
ever deserved fair?

1738
01:37:46,592 --> 01:37:49,077
The woman was forever
inclined to rash behavior

1739
01:37:49,145 --> 01:37:51,346
When in a state
of mental distress.

1740
01:37:51,414 --> 01:37:53,482
You sure must've
put her in one.

1741
01:37:53,549 --> 01:37:56,101
I believe scarlett's never
entirely gotten over

1742
01:37:56,169 --> 01:37:58,003
Her feelings
for ashley wilkes

1743
01:37:58,087 --> 01:38:00,772
And she decided
to do something about that.

1744
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,108
It would be decent of you to hear her side.

1745
01:38:04,176 --> 01:38:05,944
Do you know
where she's gone?

1746
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:07,895
No. I'll have to
find out.

1747
01:38:07,963 --> 01:38:10,015
You are getting
her side then?

1748
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,148
No.

1749
01:38:11,216 --> 01:38:13,235
I'm gonna divorce her.

1750
01:38:23,612 --> 01:38:25,480
I'll take
one of those.

1751
01:38:25,548 --> 01:38:26,681
Yes, ma'am.

1752
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:31,719
Hello.

1753
01:38:31,787 --> 01:38:34,221
Morning, ma'am. And ain't it a fine one?

1754
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:35,222
It is.

1755
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,725
I'd like to see
mr. O'hara.

1756
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:38,693
You're seeing him.

1757
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:40,695
How might I be
of service?

1758
01:38:40,763 --> 01:38:44,749
Actually, the mr. O'hara I'm
looking for would be more elderly.

1759
01:38:44,817 --> 01:38:47,519
Mr. Andrew o'hara
or mr. James o'hara.

1760
01:38:47,586 --> 01:38:50,488
Perhaps I've come
to the wrong store.

1761
01:38:50,556 --> 01:38:52,089
You've come
to the right one.

1762
01:38:52,157 --> 01:38:54,892
I'm their nephew, jamie
o'hara at your service.

1763
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,829
Oh, my goodness,
then you're my cousin.

1764
01:38:57,896 --> 01:38:59,431
Am I indeed?

1765
01:38:59,498 --> 01:39:01,633
Certainly one
not known to me.

1766
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,135
I'm katie scarlett,

1767
01:39:03,202 --> 01:39:05,603
Gerald's daughter
from atlanta.

1768
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:08,006
No doubt
you don't know it,

1769
01:39:08,074 --> 01:39:10,141
But my mother passed on.

1770
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:12,143
That was
your auntie bridget.

1771
01:39:12,211 --> 01:39:14,129
God rest her dear soul.

1772
01:39:14,196 --> 01:39:16,731
Also uncle andy's wife
as well, auntie una.

1773
01:39:16,798 --> 01:39:20,335
Ah, took the heart
out of poor uncle andy.

1774
01:39:20,403 --> 01:39:22,387
Followed her
within a month.

1775
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:24,823
Uncle james, then,
is he gone, too?

1776
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:27,225
He's not even
thinking of going.

1777
01:39:27,293 --> 01:39:30,195
Fair chance he'll
outlive the lot of us.

1778
01:39:30,263 --> 01:39:33,181
He'll be beside himself
to see you, katie scarlett.

1779
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,183
He's getting on
in years,

1780
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:38,736
But he's still able to
pull his weight. And how.

1781
01:39:38,804 --> 01:39:40,772
He's living with us
now,

1782
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,307
Me and my wife maureen
and kids.

1783
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:44,809
There's eight of them.

1784
01:39:44,877 --> 01:39:49,380
At least that was the count
when I left this morning.

1785
01:39:49,448 --> 01:39:52,951
And here's that very house,
be it ever so humble.

1786
01:39:53,018 --> 01:39:56,488
But we've all come
from a lot worse, hmm?

1787
01:39:56,555 --> 01:39:58,190
And no complaints now.

1788
01:39:59,759 --> 01:40:01,192
God rest his soul,

1789
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:05,697
I always said your father
was the best of the lot of us.

1790
01:40:05,764 --> 01:40:08,232
Have you not heard me
say it, jamie?

1791
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,233
I have.

1792
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:10,267
And often.

1793
01:40:10,335 --> 01:40:13,238
The runt of the litter
he was,

1794
01:40:13,306 --> 01:40:15,773
But hard as nails...

1795
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:20,445
And o'hara to the smallest
bone in his body.

1796
01:40:20,513 --> 01:40:23,498
A fine small man
was gerald...

1797
01:40:23,566 --> 01:40:26,184
Much as meself.
Ha ha ha.

1798
01:40:26,252 --> 01:40:27,636
I suppose you know

1799
01:40:27,703 --> 01:40:31,789
How he come by that grand
plantation of his, eh?

1800
01:40:31,857 --> 01:40:34,776
Playing poker with my money,
that's how.

1801
01:40:34,894 --> 01:40:39,530
And did I ever see a nickel
of it back? I did not.

1802
01:40:39,598 --> 01:40:42,400
Did he ever happen
to relate

1803
01:40:42,468 --> 01:40:44,835
How he come to leave ireland,
katie scarlett?

1804
01:40:44,903 --> 01:40:47,572
I would guess upwards of
about a hundred times.

1805
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:50,608
Fled with a price
on his head, he did.

1806
01:40:50,676 --> 01:40:52,644
One blow of his fist,

1807
01:40:52,711 --> 01:40:55,180
And down went that english
landlord's rent agent,

1808
01:40:55,247 --> 01:40:57,715
Never to rise again
in this world.

1809
01:40:57,783 --> 01:41:00,885
A father to make a woman
proud, I should say.

1810
01:41:00,953 --> 01:41:03,988
And so I was...
And am.

1811
01:41:04,056 --> 01:41:07,025
Here's to a dutiful
and loving daughter, then.

1812
01:41:07,093 --> 01:41:12,830
May every man be blessed with one of
her like, and five would be better.

1813
01:41:12,898 --> 01:41:16,201
And I'll add a welcome
for cousin scarlett

1814
01:41:16,268 --> 01:41:18,803
To our hearts
and to our homes.

1815
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:21,339
May she never be
out of the one,

1816
01:41:21,407 --> 01:41:23,875
Nor long absent
from the other.

1817
01:41:23,943 --> 01:41:27,778
I'm more touched than
I can find words to say.

1818
01:41:27,847 --> 01:41:29,731
Well, they're
lying about someplace.

1819
01:41:29,799 --> 01:41:32,050
I'm sure
you'll find them.

1820
01:41:33,519 --> 01:41:35,586
Right. Enough
of the feasting.

1821
01:41:35,654 --> 01:41:37,355
Let's have
some fiddlin'.

1822
01:42:34,847 --> 01:42:37,748
Oh, goodness, scarlett!

1823
01:42:37,816 --> 01:42:39,784
Are you all right,
darlin'?

1824
01:42:39,852 --> 01:42:41,820
Oh, get her a drink.

1825
01:42:41,887 --> 01:42:43,170
Oh, my dear.

1826
01:42:43,238 --> 01:42:44,272
Are you all right?

1827
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:47,042
You simply must let us
summon a physician.

1828
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:48,610
You're just being stubborn.

1829
01:42:48,678 --> 01:42:49,644
Stubborn.

1830
01:42:49,711 --> 01:42:52,347
I'm fine. I just
overdid it, that's all.

1831
01:42:52,415 --> 01:42:55,850
I'm recovering quite nicely
without the aid of a doctor.

1832
01:42:55,918 --> 01:42:58,820
The best thing
you could do for me

1833
01:42:58,887 --> 01:43:03,541
Would be to stop standing there
wringing your hands and just shoo.

1834
01:43:03,609 --> 01:43:06,544
If you feel the slightest
further bit indisposed,

1835
01:43:06,612 --> 01:43:07,946
Call for, uh...

1836
01:43:08,013 --> 01:43:08,947
Pansy!

1837
01:43:09,015 --> 01:43:11,149
Yes, and she'd send
for the doctor.

1838
01:43:11,217 --> 01:43:12,150
Shoo!

1839
01:43:12,218 --> 01:43:13,318
Shoo! Shoo!

1840
01:43:13,386 --> 01:43:14,319
Uh...

1841
01:43:14,387 --> 01:43:15,487
Uh, scarlett...

1842
01:43:15,554 --> 01:43:16,721
Shoo!

1843
01:43:16,788 --> 01:43:18,356
Uh, y-yes.

1844
01:43:21,827 --> 01:43:24,429
You're still looking kind
of purplish, miss scarlett.

1845
01:43:24,447 --> 01:43:26,347
Are you sure-

1846
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:28,149
I'm not ill, pansy.

1847
01:43:28,216 --> 01:43:29,601
I'm...

1848
01:43:31,303 --> 01:43:32,804
Indisposed.

1849
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,274
It must be suppertime.
Go get your supper.

1850
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:38,660
Can I bring you
something up?

1851
01:43:38,727 --> 01:43:41,146
Not right now.
Maybe later.

1852
01:43:41,213 --> 01:43:43,214
Go and have your supper.

1853
01:44:00,232 --> 01:44:02,166
My beautiful,

1854
01:44:02,234 --> 01:44:07,304
Enchanting, magical
little...Indisposition.

1855
01:44:10,259 --> 01:44:12,727
You're just going to
have to go on being

1856
01:44:12,794 --> 01:44:16,281
The teeniest little bit
of a fib for a while.

1857
01:44:16,349 --> 01:44:18,249
I know you don't mind,

1858
01:44:18,317 --> 01:44:20,684
Considering
the good cause it's in.

1859
01:44:20,752 --> 01:44:24,622
The good cause being
just the exact right time

1860
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:27,225
To introduce you
to your daddy.

1861
01:44:27,293 --> 01:44:30,145
I don't know when
the right time will be,

1862
01:44:30,212 --> 01:44:33,147
But I'll just have to
content myself

1863
01:44:33,215 --> 01:44:35,733
With imagining
the expression

1864
01:44:35,801 --> 01:44:39,153
On the handsome visage
of mr. Rhett butler

1865
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:43,141
When he finds out I'm giving
him another sweet life...

1866
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:46,744
For the one
we so tragically lost.

1867
01:44:49,815 --> 01:44:52,700
Oh, my darlin' little
indisposition,

1868
01:44:52,767 --> 01:44:55,252
I pray you're a girl.

1869
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,155
Please, please,
be a girl.

1870
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,170
Morning, boss.

1871
01:45:13,239 --> 01:45:14,372
Morning.

1872
01:45:43,702 --> 01:45:46,154
Hmm. I'd say
they're an improvement

1873
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:47,655
Over the last lot.

1874
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:49,457
And right to say it.

1875
01:45:49,525 --> 01:45:53,093
There's 10 more coming from
new york within the week.

1876
01:45:55,514 --> 01:45:57,648
And a thousand rounds.

1877
01:45:57,716 --> 01:45:59,150
That's all right,
then.

1878
01:45:59,218 --> 01:46:02,887
Will I make the usual
arrangements for the shipment?

1879
01:46:04,022 --> 01:46:05,172
You will.

1880
01:46:13,832 --> 01:46:15,800
From the look
of them,

1881
01:46:15,867 --> 01:46:18,836
I'd venture your hands
haven't done kitchen work

1882
01:46:18,904 --> 01:46:21,839
For quite some time,
scarlett, if ever.

1883
01:46:21,907 --> 01:46:23,341
They've done
far rougher things

1884
01:46:23,409 --> 01:46:25,910
Than shell peas
in their time, maureen.

1885
01:46:25,978 --> 01:46:26,911
Have they?

1886
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:29,046
You don't look it.

1887
01:46:29,114 --> 01:46:31,082
Are you rich,
scarlett?

1888
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:35,620
Well, I guess you could say
I'm pretty well off, yes.

1889
01:46:35,687 --> 01:46:37,638
So I says to jamie.

1890
01:46:37,706 --> 01:46:39,757
Carries herself rich,
I says.

1891
01:46:39,825 --> 01:46:42,793
Not to mention stopping
at the manse

1892
01:46:42,862 --> 01:46:47,281
Of mr. Pierre robillard, grand
mucky-muck of savannah hoi polloi.

1893
01:46:47,349 --> 01:46:50,567
Shall I tell you
how I got rich?

1894
01:46:50,635 --> 01:46:53,187
I think I'd enjoy
the telling.

1895
01:46:55,374 --> 01:46:56,707
Well...

1896
01:47:10,656 --> 01:47:13,707
So I took the inheritance
from my second husband-

1897
01:47:13,776 --> 01:47:15,243
If I'm late for lunch,

1898
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,278
I must be in time
for supper.

1899
01:47:17,345 --> 01:47:19,313
Colum! Ye devil!

1900
01:47:19,381 --> 01:47:21,849
Not a word of warning.

1901
01:47:21,917 --> 01:47:25,069
I was hoping to catch you in the act.

1902
01:47:25,137 --> 01:47:26,938
Get away,
you terrible man.

1903
01:47:27,005 --> 01:47:29,107
If I wasn't a priest,

1904
01:47:29,174 --> 01:47:31,475
Nothing would save you
from my worldly attentions.

1905
01:47:31,543 --> 01:47:33,461
Blasphemer.
Now here's a surprise.

1906
01:47:33,528 --> 01:47:36,264
I'll bet me Sunday bonnet
on that.

1907
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:39,383
She's the landlord's
daughter come for the rent.

1908
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:42,453
Nothing of the kind.
She's scarlett o'hara butler,

1909
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:46,440
Down from charleston to make the
acquaintance of her savannah kin,

1910
01:47:46,508 --> 01:47:48,559
And long overdue it was.

1911
01:47:48,627 --> 01:47:51,512
Scarlett, say hello to
father colum terence o'hara,

1912
01:47:51,579 --> 01:47:55,066
Here from ireland and
another one of your cousins,

1913
01:47:55,133 --> 01:47:57,602
May god have mercy on you.

1914
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:59,753
Pleasure to make your acquaintance,
scarlett o'hara butler.

1915
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:01,372
Well, bless me, father.

1916
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,125
It's been a heck
of a long time

1917
01:48:04,192 --> 01:48:06,310
Since I've been
to confession.

1918
01:48:12,851 --> 01:48:16,003
Happy birthday, father.

1919
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:18,088
Happy birthday,
grandfather.

1920
01:48:22,794 --> 01:48:25,980
Will you open your gifts
in the drawing room, father?

1921
01:48:26,047 --> 01:48:27,731
No.

1922
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,534
Would you rather
we brought them in here?

1923
01:48:30,603 --> 01:48:32,236
I would not.

1924
01:48:32,237 --> 01:48:35,606
Where would you like to open
your presents, grandfather?

1925
01:48:35,674 --> 01:48:38,141
At a place
of my choosing,

1926
01:48:38,209 --> 01:48:40,711
At a time
of my choice,

1927
01:48:40,779 --> 01:48:43,414
And most certainly
in private.

1928
01:48:43,482 --> 01:48:45,949
I suppose, after some
considerable thought,

1929
01:48:46,017 --> 01:48:48,819
I might be able to imagine
something sadder

1930
01:48:48,887 --> 01:48:50,688
Than opening
birthday presents alone,

1931
01:48:50,755 --> 01:48:51,822
But I doubt it.

1932
01:48:53,258 --> 01:48:54,758
Scarlett, good heavens.

1933
01:48:54,826 --> 01:48:58,962
I was hoping to enjoy
your seeing what I got you.

1934
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:00,898
Perhaps you will.

1935
01:49:00,965 --> 01:49:04,052
I mean me seeing you
seeing it.

1936
01:49:04,119 --> 01:49:06,570
I know what you mean.

1937
01:49:10,308 --> 01:49:14,311
See what you've done?

1938
01:49:14,379 --> 01:49:16,347
In absolute and certain
knowledge

1939
01:49:16,415 --> 01:49:18,866
That scarlett will not
make her own apologies,

1940
01:49:18,934 --> 01:49:20,835
No matter
how deeply owed,

1941
01:49:20,903 --> 01:49:22,520
May I beg your pardon

1942
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:24,588
In her stead, father?

1943
01:49:24,656 --> 01:49:27,458
However much pauline
and I may regret

1944
01:49:27,526 --> 01:49:30,177
Having to return to
charleston tomorrow, we can,

1945
01:49:30,245 --> 01:49:31,762
And certainly you may

1946
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:33,664
Take some modicum
of comfort in knowing

1947
01:49:33,732 --> 01:49:35,899
That scarlett will
be returning with us.

1948
01:49:35,967 --> 01:49:37,868
I'll be staying.

1949
01:49:39,203 --> 01:49:40,404
I beg your pardon?

1950
01:49:40,472 --> 01:49:42,439
I'll be staying on
for a bit.

1951
01:49:42,507 --> 01:49:44,641
What are you saying?

1952
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:48,312
She says she'll be staying
a while! Are you deaf?

1953
01:49:48,379 --> 01:49:51,149
May one ask why,
scarlett?

1954
01:49:51,216 --> 01:49:54,184
I still haven't settled
with the sisters of mercy

1955
01:49:54,253 --> 01:49:56,754
About buying back
careen's share of tara,

1956
01:49:56,821 --> 01:49:59,290
And I'm not leaving savannah
till I do.

1957
01:49:59,358 --> 01:50:02,793
Besides, I'm just getting to
know my o'hara relatives here,

1958
01:50:02,861 --> 01:50:06,697
And I'm in no hurry to stop
knowing them so quick.

1959
01:50:06,765 --> 01:50:09,233
Well, if you remain
in savannah,

1960
01:50:09,301 --> 01:50:10,768
Where will you stay?

1961
01:50:10,835 --> 01:50:14,204
My o'hara kin would gladly
have me stay with them,

1962
01:50:14,273 --> 01:50:16,674
But they don't have
room for pansy,

1963
01:50:16,759 --> 01:50:19,160
And I can't get along
without pansy,

1964
01:50:19,177 --> 01:50:22,246
Of course,
I could go to a hotel.

1965
01:50:22,314 --> 01:50:26,317
There must be at least one
decent accommodation in savannah.

1966
01:50:26,384 --> 01:50:28,852
Or I could just
offer myself up

1967
01:50:28,921 --> 01:50:31,322
To the good graces
of grandfather robillard

1968
01:50:31,389 --> 01:50:33,624
And hope he might
provide shelter

1969
01:50:33,692 --> 01:50:36,227
For the relatively brief time
I'll be remaining.

1970
01:50:36,294 --> 01:50:38,762
Stay if you like.

1971
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:43,517
It is a matter of supreme
indifference to me.

1972
01:50:43,585 --> 01:50:44,935
See?

1973
01:50:45,003 --> 01:50:47,371
I knew I'd be welcome.

1974
01:50:52,477 --> 01:50:54,344
Giddyup!

1975
01:51:01,536 --> 01:51:02,503
Whoa.

1976
01:51:02,571 --> 01:51:03,504
Good morning.

1977
01:51:03,572 --> 01:51:05,038
Rhett! Well,
good morning.

1978
01:51:05,106 --> 01:51:07,575
How are you this fine day, my dear?

1979
01:51:07,643 --> 01:51:09,777
Quite fine this fine day,
and yourself?

1980
01:51:09,844 --> 01:51:11,312
I couldn't be better.

1981
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:14,315
I see you've made the
purchase of a new frock.

1982
01:51:14,382 --> 01:51:16,367
A frock? Why, no, it's-

1983
01:51:16,435 --> 01:51:19,436
There you go again,
teasing me, rhett butler.

1984
01:51:19,504 --> 01:51:20,955
How might I make amends?

1985
01:51:21,022 --> 01:51:23,374
I might find some
forgiveness in my heart

1986
01:51:23,442 --> 01:51:27,512
If you would offer me
a ride to the library.

1987
01:51:27,579 --> 01:51:31,115
If it isn't too terribly
bold of me to mention it,

1988
01:51:31,183 --> 01:51:33,651
I was sincerely
sorry to hear

1989
01:51:33,718 --> 01:51:36,186
Of the difficulties
between you and mrs. Butler.

1990
01:51:36,254 --> 01:51:37,721
Thank you.
As for boldness,

1991
01:51:37,789 --> 01:51:40,824
It happens to be a
quality I admire in women.

1992
01:51:40,892 --> 01:51:42,677
That's very unusual.

1993
01:51:42,744 --> 01:51:44,178
In my experience,

1994
01:51:44,245 --> 01:51:46,313
Which of course
has been quite limited,

1995
01:51:46,381 --> 01:51:49,817
I've observed that gentlemen are
generally somewhat discomposed

1996
01:51:49,885 --> 01:51:52,753
By any show of
forthrightness in a lady.

1997
01:51:52,821 --> 01:51:55,289
I think gentlemen
generally are.

1998
01:51:55,357 --> 01:51:58,325
I gather you don't count
yourself in that company?

1999
01:51:58,393 --> 01:52:00,361
In the company
of gentlemen

2000
01:52:00,428 --> 01:52:02,396
Or the company
of gentlemen

2001
01:52:02,464 --> 01:52:03,898
Discomposed by
forthright ladies?

2002
01:52:03,966 --> 01:52:05,500
Are you teasing me
again?

2003
01:52:05,567 --> 01:52:08,002
Why do you keep
doing that?

2004
01:52:08,069 --> 01:52:11,038
I seem unable to
resist it, don't I?

2005
01:52:11,106 --> 01:52:14,108
Maybe it's because of the
charming, delightful manner

2006
01:52:14,175 --> 01:52:17,277
With which
you respond to it.

2007
01:52:17,345 --> 01:52:20,297
Daddy says you're something
of a gambler.

2008
01:52:20,365 --> 01:52:23,333
I've played a hand of cards
now and again.

2009
01:52:23,401 --> 01:52:25,369
Mother doesn't like
daddy to gamble.

2010
01:52:25,436 --> 01:52:27,838
She says there's
too much chance of losing.

2011
01:52:27,906 --> 01:52:30,674
If you don't chance the losing,
you can't chance the winning.

2012
01:52:30,742 --> 01:52:33,744
Wish I could be that way
sometimes.

2013
01:52:33,812 --> 01:52:34,745
What way?

2014
01:52:34,813 --> 01:52:37,281
The way you said
about gambling.

2015
01:52:37,349 --> 01:52:41,352
Sometimes I wish I could throw
caution to the four winds,

2016
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:44,455
Laugh at fate, let the
chips fall where they may.

2017
01:52:44,522 --> 01:52:46,057
Maybe you will one day.

2018
01:52:46,124 --> 01:52:48,125
I can't imagine it.

2019
01:52:48,193 --> 01:52:49,493
Sometimes
we need someone

2020
01:52:49,561 --> 01:52:52,196
To help our imaginations
along a bit.

2021
01:52:52,264 --> 01:52:54,031
Do you think so?

2022
01:52:54,099 --> 01:52:58,202
I've often known that
to be the case.

2023
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:00,737
Always bearing in mind,
of course,

2024
01:53:00,805 --> 01:53:02,840
That you risk
the losing.

2025
01:53:04,042 --> 01:53:05,576
And chance the winning.

2026
01:53:11,883 --> 01:53:13,384
This is it.

2027
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,386
What's the matter?

2028
01:53:16,454 --> 01:53:18,421
Maybe I best
wait outside.

2029
01:53:18,489 --> 01:53:19,423
Why?

2030
01:53:19,491 --> 01:53:20,958
Being a baptist?

2031
01:53:21,025 --> 01:53:24,812
Silly. It's not a church.
It's a convent for nuns.

2032
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,197
Even if it was a church,

2033
01:53:27,265 --> 01:53:29,734
You'd be perfectly free
to go in.

2034
01:53:29,801 --> 01:53:34,371
Besides, they'd probably be
delighted to get their hands on you.

2035
01:53:40,929 --> 01:53:42,196
The decision, of course,

2036
01:53:42,264 --> 01:53:44,247
Lies in
the bishop's hands.

2037
01:53:44,315 --> 01:53:47,285
You can't accept my offer on your own?

2038
01:53:47,352 --> 01:53:48,819
Out of the question.

2039
01:53:48,887 --> 01:53:51,289
I have to talk
to the bishop now?

2040
01:53:51,356 --> 01:53:52,506
Certainly not.

2041
01:53:52,574 --> 01:53:55,426
I'll present your suggestion
to him on your behalf.

2042
01:53:55,494 --> 01:53:59,430
I wouldn't want to put
you to all that trouble.

2043
01:53:59,498 --> 01:54:01,532
I'd be more than happy
to speak to the bishop.

2044
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:03,367
That would be impossible.

2045
01:54:03,435 --> 01:54:05,035
When will you talk
to him?

2046
01:54:05,103 --> 01:54:08,739
I have an appointment with
bishop flynn three days hence.

2047
01:54:08,806 --> 01:54:10,841
Perhaps the opportunity
will arise

2048
01:54:10,908 --> 01:54:13,844
For me to convey
your wishes to him.

2049
01:54:13,912 --> 01:54:15,479
He's irish?

2050
01:54:15,547 --> 01:54:17,915
County meath, I believe.

2051
01:54:17,983 --> 01:54:22,653
Could you mention to him
that my maiden name is o'hara?

2052
01:54:24,456 --> 01:54:25,523
Just as a note-

2053
01:54:25,590 --> 01:54:29,059
Personal curiosity
on my part, if I may?

2054
01:54:29,127 --> 01:54:30,594
Go right ahead.

2055
01:54:30,662 --> 01:54:33,630
Should the bishop look
favorably upon your request

2056
01:54:33,698 --> 01:54:36,667
And agree to exchange
our interest in tara

2057
01:54:36,735 --> 01:54:41,138
For your generous donation
to the sisters of mercy,

2058
01:54:41,206 --> 01:54:43,707
By my reckoning
that still leaves

2059
01:54:43,775 --> 01:54:46,243
The 1/3 share
in the property

2060
01:54:46,311 --> 01:54:48,279
Retained by
your other sister.

2061
01:54:48,347 --> 01:54:49,280
Suellen.

2062
01:54:49,347 --> 01:54:50,914
Suellen, yes.

2063
01:54:50,982 --> 01:54:52,816
Which would effectively
still deny you

2064
01:54:52,884 --> 01:54:56,653
The full ownership
you so passionately desire.

2065
01:54:56,721 --> 01:54:59,055
Your reckoning is right,
sister.

2066
01:54:59,123 --> 01:55:02,026
I'll just have to think
about that tomorrow.

2067
01:55:05,663 --> 01:55:06,847
Miss scarlett.

2068
01:55:06,915 --> 01:55:09,082
Oh, miss scarlett,
wake up.

2069
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:13,204
He wants to see you right
this minute, he says.

2070
01:55:13,271 --> 01:55:14,355
What?

2071
01:55:14,422 --> 01:55:15,973
Who wants me?

2072
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,992
Him.

2073
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:25,332
What's the matter,
grandfather?

2074
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,319
My breakfast
is unsatisfactory.

2075
01:55:28,386 --> 01:55:30,554
You got me out of bed
for that?

2076
01:55:30,622 --> 01:55:33,357
I got you out of bed
to do something about it.

2077
01:55:33,425 --> 01:55:36,393
What have I got to do
with your breakfast?

2078
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:39,429
Send it back and tell them
to bring what you want.

2079
01:55:39,431 --> 01:55:40,764
You tell them.

2080
01:55:40,832 --> 01:55:43,501
What am I, some kind
of hired help?

2081
01:55:43,568 --> 01:55:44,768
Order
your own breakfast.

2082
01:55:44,836 --> 01:55:46,253
I'm going
back to bed.

2083
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:49,874
The bed to which you believe
you are returning, young woman,

2084
01:55:49,941 --> 01:55:51,441
Belongs to me.

2085
01:55:51,509 --> 01:55:55,646
You occupy it only by
my grace and favor.

2086
01:55:55,714 --> 01:55:57,080
Is that a threat?

2087
01:55:57,148 --> 01:56:00,251
It is
a pertinent observation.

2088
01:56:08,226 --> 01:56:11,729
Maybe I'll talk to your
cook about her grits.

2089
01:56:11,796 --> 01:56:15,265
I wonder
if you have noticed

2090
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:17,334
The portrait of your
grandmother robillard

2091
01:56:17,402 --> 01:56:18,702
In the drawing room.

2092
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:21,905
I have. She was
a stunningly beautiful woman.

2093
01:56:21,973 --> 01:56:24,708
You favor her
remarkably.

2094
01:56:24,776 --> 01:56:26,109
Why, thank you,
grandfather.

2095
01:56:26,177 --> 01:56:29,513
Would that you might resemble
her in other respects.

2096
01:56:29,581 --> 01:56:31,815
What other respects?

2097
01:56:31,883 --> 01:56:35,286
She was a woman
of consummate grace,

2098
01:56:35,353 --> 01:56:37,154
Of great gentleness
and gentility.

2099
01:56:37,222 --> 01:56:39,256
I guess
I wasn't in school

2100
01:56:39,324 --> 01:56:41,358
The day
they handed those out.

2101
01:56:41,426 --> 01:56:46,646
Still...I suppose there
might be something to be said

2102
01:56:46,714 --> 01:56:47,781
For...Spirit.

2103
01:56:47,816 --> 01:56:49,833
There's folks
who think so.

2104
01:56:49,901 --> 01:56:51,184
I shouldn't wonder.

2105
01:56:52,487 --> 01:56:54,371
Grace, gentility
and all that-

2106
01:56:54,439 --> 01:56:58,208
Those are easy things
to take to.

2107
01:56:58,276 --> 01:57:02,279
I guess spirit takes some
getting used to by some

2108
01:57:02,347 --> 01:57:05,099
Before they can
appreciate it.

2109
01:57:05,167 --> 01:57:08,219
You may be right.

2110
01:57:08,286 --> 01:57:10,671
What precisely
is wrong

2111
01:57:10,738 --> 01:57:14,457
With the grits?

2112
01:57:14,525 --> 01:57:16,359
Where is
your parish?

2113
01:57:16,427 --> 01:57:17,995
I have no parish.

2114
01:57:18,062 --> 01:57:20,597
Who'd trust him
with one?

2115
01:57:20,664 --> 01:57:23,300
Only a fool
or the devil.

2116
01:57:25,069 --> 01:57:26,870
Are you
a missionary priest?

2117
01:57:26,938 --> 01:57:30,941
Laboring to ease the suffering
of the poor and bereft.

2118
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:34,010
There's no one
like him for it.

2119
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:36,647
You must travel
quite a bit.

2120
01:57:36,714 --> 01:57:38,149
Oh, wherever I'm called.

2121
01:57:38,216 --> 01:57:40,551
But I'm never long away
from ireland.

2122
01:57:40,618 --> 01:57:43,587
Do you have any influence with bishop flynn

2123
01:57:43,655 --> 01:57:45,989
Here in savannah?

2124
01:57:46,057 --> 01:57:48,526
A hard man,
the good bishop,

2125
01:57:48,593 --> 01:57:50,060
And not easily influenced.

2126
01:57:50,128 --> 01:57:51,462
Why do you ask?

2127
01:57:51,529 --> 01:57:52,996
He turned me down

2128
01:57:53,064 --> 01:57:55,532
About buying back
careen's share of tara.

2129
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,801
I mentioned
me wanting to buy it.

2130
01:57:57,869 --> 01:57:59,269
Turned you down,
has he?

2131
01:57:59,337 --> 01:58:01,838
I can hardly
keep from crying

2132
01:58:01,906 --> 01:58:04,942
Every time
I think about it.

2133
01:58:05,009 --> 01:58:08,245
It would have meant
the world to me.

2134
01:58:08,313 --> 01:58:10,280
I wonder
if the bishop

2135
01:58:10,348 --> 01:58:12,782
Might be persuaded
otherwise.

2136
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:13,784
By who?

2137
01:58:13,852 --> 01:58:16,353
Are you aware
there's a cathedral

2138
01:58:16,421 --> 01:58:18,888
Being erected
here in savannah?

2139
01:58:18,956 --> 01:58:20,190
No. Is there?

2140
01:58:20,258 --> 01:58:21,525
There is.

2141
01:58:21,593 --> 01:58:23,860
And the foreman
of all the bricklayers

2142
01:58:23,928 --> 01:58:25,496
Laboring on this
magnificent structure

2143
01:58:25,564 --> 01:58:27,298
Is a man called
tommy shannon,

2144
01:58:27,365 --> 01:58:29,333
A good friend
to yours truly

2145
01:58:29,401 --> 01:58:31,402
And has been
these many years.

2146
01:58:31,469 --> 01:58:34,705
He's also the husband
to my sister pidge.

2147
01:58:34,773 --> 01:58:37,508
Tommy could be persuaded
to let it be known

2148
01:58:37,576 --> 01:58:39,075
In an indirect manner

2149
01:58:39,143 --> 01:58:42,780
That a considerable slowdown in
the progress of the work might occur

2150
01:58:42,847 --> 01:58:45,949
Unless the bishop were to
reconsider his unreasonable attitude.

2151
01:58:46,017 --> 01:58:47,318
That's blackmail.

2152
01:58:47,385 --> 01:58:50,387
Of course,
if it doesn't sit well-

2153
01:58:50,455 --> 01:58:53,290
I didn't say
it didn't sit well.

2154
01:58:55,994 --> 01:58:57,794
Family...

2155
01:58:57,862 --> 01:59:00,631
It's a grand thing.

2156
01:59:05,754 --> 01:59:07,036
If I were your lawyer,
rhett,

2157
01:59:07,104 --> 01:59:09,073
This document would never
have been drawn up.

2158
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:10,624
Why not?

2159
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:13,327
Why? It flies in the face

2160
01:59:13,395 --> 01:59:17,798
Of every moral tenet that
we hold dear to our hearts.

2161
01:59:17,865 --> 01:59:19,333
My lawyer did mention

2162
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:22,419
It was a somewhat unusual
action for an individual to take.

2163
01:59:22,487 --> 01:59:23,420
Somewhat unusual?

2164
01:59:23,488 --> 01:59:24,588
Heavens, rhett,

2165
01:59:24,656 --> 01:59:26,256
It is almost unheard of!

2166
01:59:26,323 --> 01:59:28,992
Maybe it should be
heard of more often.

2167
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:32,162
Have you no respect whatsoever
for the sanctity of marriage?

2168
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:35,265
I guess that'd depend
on the marriage, henry.

2169
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:38,235
I can think of three
or four right now

2170
01:59:38,303 --> 01:59:40,604
I'd say don't have
much sanctity in them.

2171
01:59:40,672 --> 01:59:44,140
I'd have to add my own one
to that number.

2172
01:59:44,209 --> 01:59:46,543
Have you informed scarlett
of these intentions?

2173
01:59:46,611 --> 01:59:47,978
I would have if I could.

2174
01:59:48,046 --> 01:59:49,613
I don't know where she is.

2175
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,598
I wish with all my heart

2176
01:59:51,666 --> 01:59:53,683
You would reconsider
this drastic action.

2177
01:59:53,751 --> 01:59:56,102
It so violates everything we believe in.

2178
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:59,439
I'd appreciate it if you'd
forward those papers to your client

2179
01:59:59,507 --> 02:00:01,391
With the utmost dispatch,
henry.

2180
02:00:01,459 --> 02:00:03,594
Oh...

2181
02:00:03,628 --> 02:00:05,395
Poor scarlett.

2182
02:00:05,463 --> 02:00:07,364
If there's one thing
scarlett isn't,

2183
02:00:07,431 --> 02:00:08,599
It's poor.

2184
02:00:31,055 --> 02:00:34,023
You wanted to see me,
grandfather?

2185
02:00:34,125 --> 02:00:36,693
First I wish
to thank you

2186
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:39,229
For your
birthday gift to me.

2187
02:00:39,297 --> 02:00:41,398
You're welcome.
I'm glad it fits.

2188
02:00:41,466 --> 02:00:44,935
I apologize for losing
my temper the other day

2189
02:00:45,003 --> 02:00:46,503
And the result of that.

2190
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:50,674
I am 94 years old.

2191
02:00:50,741 --> 02:00:52,075
You sure don't look it.

2192
02:00:52,143 --> 02:00:53,310
Don't carry your remorse

2193
02:00:53,378 --> 02:00:55,112
To the extent
of desperate flattery.

2194
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:57,931
Then I take it back.

2195
02:00:57,999 --> 02:01:01,552
I have no reasonable expectation
of living much longer.

2196
02:01:01,619 --> 02:01:04,587
I have a request to make
to you.

2197
02:01:04,689 --> 02:01:08,692
It is my wish that
you remain with me here

2198
02:01:08,759 --> 02:01:11,661
For the duration
of my life.

2199
02:01:11,729 --> 02:01:13,130
Remain with you?

2200
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:14,964
I don't understand,
grandfather.

2201
02:01:15,032 --> 02:01:19,035
If you will remain in
this house as a chatelaine,

2202
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,570
Attend to my comforts,

2203
02:01:20,638 --> 02:01:22,005
Conform with my wishes,

2204
02:01:22,073 --> 02:01:24,641
I am prepared
to designate you

2205
02:01:24,709 --> 02:01:27,811
As my sole heir.

2206
02:01:27,878 --> 02:01:30,763
My estate,
as you surely are aware,

2207
02:01:30,831 --> 02:01:34,551
Is not inconsiderable.

2208
02:01:34,619 --> 02:01:37,237
I'm a married woman,
grandfather.

2209
02:01:37,305 --> 02:01:40,557
I expect I shall be able to
tolerate your marital status.

2210
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:42,575
I have responsibilities
and obligations.

2211
02:01:42,643 --> 02:01:45,345
I can't just
walk away from them.

2212
02:01:51,969 --> 02:01:53,536
And considering
all those considerations,

2213
02:01:53,604 --> 02:01:57,073
I'm sure you'll understand that
no matter how generous your offer

2214
02:01:57,141 --> 02:02:00,143
Or however much I'm
sincerely touched by it,

2215
02:02:00,211 --> 02:02:03,213
It would be out of the
question for me to accept.

2216
02:02:03,281 --> 02:02:07,718
As yet you do not know
how generous my offer is.

2217
02:02:07,785 --> 02:02:10,687
My estate
is presently valued

2218
02:02:10,755 --> 02:02:15,058
In excess of $500,000.

2219
02:02:16,861 --> 02:02:18,328
Half a million dollars?

2220
02:02:18,395 --> 02:02:20,363
And you my sole heir.

2221
02:02:20,431 --> 02:02:24,668
I didn't think any one person
had that much money.

2222
02:02:24,736 --> 02:02:26,637
You were mistaken.

2223
02:02:26,704 --> 02:02:28,138
Half a million dollars?

2224
02:02:28,205 --> 02:02:32,609
I agree it is a sum that
may bear certain repetition,

2225
02:02:32,677 --> 02:02:35,446
But we need not belabor
the point, scarlett.

2226
02:02:35,513 --> 02:02:37,481
You'd give me
all that money

2227
02:02:37,549 --> 02:02:40,050
If I stayed on here
till you passed on?

2228
02:02:40,117 --> 02:02:43,821
Under the conditions
of my needs and wishes.

2229
02:02:53,247 --> 02:02:56,866
Well,
what is your answer?

2230
02:02:58,653 --> 02:02:59,887
No.

2231
02:03:01,105 --> 02:03:02,739
My answer has to be no.

2232
02:03:02,807 --> 02:03:05,175
You refuse my proposal?

2233
02:03:05,242 --> 02:03:06,977
I'm afraid
I just have to.

2234
02:03:07,045 --> 02:03:09,179
<i>How dare you!</i>

2235
02:03:09,246 --> 02:03:13,250
How dare you turn up
your papist, peasant nose

2236
02:03:13,317 --> 02:03:15,785
At the opportunity
to become mistress

2237
02:03:15,853 --> 02:03:17,520
Of this great house

2238
02:03:17,588 --> 02:03:19,656
And attendant
to its master!

2239
02:03:19,724 --> 02:03:22,058
Even supposing
I was able to tolerate

2240
02:03:22,126 --> 02:03:23,827
Your intolerable manners-

2241
02:03:23,894 --> 02:03:26,095
Which I most definitely
would not-

2242
02:03:26,163 --> 02:03:29,132
The fact that I can
turn down your proposition

2243
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,167
With hardly a twinge
of regret

2244
02:03:31,235 --> 02:03:32,603
Is some indication to me

2245
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:35,138
That maybe I'm just
beginning to think

2246
02:03:35,205 --> 02:03:39,143
There might be more important
things than money after all.

2247
02:04:09,891 --> 02:04:12,159
I hope you don't mind me
saying this,

2248
02:04:12,227 --> 02:04:13,693
But I'm a bit confused.

2249
02:04:13,761 --> 02:04:16,230
I don't doubt
that maureen is as well.

2250
02:04:16,297 --> 02:04:17,748
Here's
a bill of divorcement

2251
02:04:17,815 --> 02:04:19,799
From the husband
you've told us

2252
02:04:19,867 --> 02:04:22,819
Is dying for your return
to his side in charleston.

2253
02:04:22,887 --> 02:04:25,906
There is a bit
of confusion there.

2254
02:04:25,973 --> 02:04:26,957
I fibbed.

2255
02:04:27,024 --> 02:04:29,526
Oh. Then
that's clarified.

2256
02:04:29,594 --> 02:04:32,896
Then this document's more
of a shock than a surprise.

2257
02:04:32,964 --> 02:04:35,932
No. It's as much one
as the other.

2258
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,501
I never dreamed that-

2259
02:04:37,535 --> 02:04:41,371
I never imagined
rhett would...

2260
02:04:42,739 --> 02:04:47,227
What am I going to do?

2261
02:04:47,295 --> 02:04:49,546
There now, love.

2262
02:04:49,614 --> 02:04:52,515
It's him that's committed
the sin of divorce, not you.

2263
02:04:52,583 --> 02:04:56,386
And it's him who'll suffer
the wrath of god for it.

2264
02:04:56,453 --> 02:04:58,221
I'm pregnant.

2265
02:04:58,289 --> 02:04:59,756
Glory be to god.

2266
02:04:59,824 --> 02:05:02,759
Is the man
such a blackguard

2267
02:05:02,827 --> 02:05:05,595
As to divorce the woman carrying his child?

2268
02:05:05,663 --> 02:05:06,829
He doesn't know.

2269
02:05:06,897 --> 02:05:08,198
What are you saying,
scarlett?

2270
02:05:08,266 --> 02:05:10,300
We had a silly old quarrel.

2271
02:05:10,368 --> 02:05:11,702
We weren't
on speaking terms.

2272
02:05:11,769 --> 02:05:15,806
I was waiting for
the right time to tell him.

2273
02:05:15,873 --> 02:05:17,340
That'd be about now.

2274
02:05:17,408 --> 02:05:18,374
Never!

2275
02:05:18,442 --> 02:05:21,344
Never, never, never!

2276
02:05:21,412 --> 02:05:22,378
Divorce me?

2277
02:05:22,446 --> 02:05:23,914
Divorce me, will he?

2278
02:05:23,981 --> 02:05:27,383
There may come a day when he finds
out I've borne him another child,

2279
02:05:27,451 --> 02:05:31,021
But it'll be over my
wizened and lifeless body.

2280
02:05:31,055 --> 02:05:33,540
Your mind's
in too much turmoil

2281
02:05:33,608 --> 02:05:35,074
To be thinking clearly.

2282
02:05:35,142 --> 02:05:39,645
It's quite clear you won't be
able to keep the truth from him

2283
02:05:39,713 --> 02:05:41,431
Once your baby's come.

2284
02:05:41,499 --> 02:05:43,716
He could hear it
from someone else.

2285
02:05:43,784 --> 02:05:45,752
Far better
if it's from you.

2286
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:47,321
If I'm far away,

2287
02:05:47,438 --> 02:05:49,272
There'll be
nobody to tell him.

2288
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:51,241
What's on your mind,
scarlett?

2289
02:05:51,309 --> 02:05:53,743
Far away where?

2290
02:05:53,811 --> 02:05:55,078
When I was a girl,

2291
02:05:55,145 --> 02:05:58,114
My pa was forever going on
about ireland.

2292
02:05:58,182 --> 02:06:01,585
Maybe it's time I saw
what he was going on about.

2293
02:06:01,652 --> 02:06:03,553
You're for ireland,
then?

2294
02:06:03,621 --> 02:06:05,789
I'm for ireland.

2295
02:06:47,298 --> 02:06:50,400
It's the most breathtaking
country I've ever laid eyes on,

2296
02:06:50,468 --> 02:06:52,402
Just like pa
always described it.

2297
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,905
We always thought he was
gilding the truth a bit.

2298
02:06:54,972 --> 02:06:57,858
No need to gild it,
is there?

2299
02:06:57,925 --> 02:07:01,862
I never thought I'd ever see a
place more beautiful than georgia.

2300
02:07:01,929 --> 02:07:04,397
Before the war,
of course.

2301
02:07:14,225 --> 02:07:16,108
It's like another world
altogether.

2302
02:07:16,176 --> 02:07:19,228
It's so...So ancient.

2303
02:07:19,263 --> 02:07:23,133
Nothing like ancient.
200 years maybe.

2304
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:24,868
Fairly new.

2305
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:31,241
I adore it.
I simply adore it.

2306
02:07:31,308 --> 02:07:34,227
Are we far from
uncle daniel's house?

2307
02:07:34,295 --> 02:07:35,728
Not far now.

2308
02:07:35,796 --> 02:07:37,713
Let me just
go over it.

2309
02:07:37,782 --> 02:07:40,216
There's grandmother, katie
scarlett, whose namesake I am.

2310
02:07:40,284 --> 02:07:43,753
Never, never did I imagine
I'd meet her face-to-face.

2311
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:46,739
There's uncle daniel,
your pa,

2312
02:07:46,807 --> 02:07:48,841
And my pa's eldest brother,

2313
02:07:48,909 --> 02:07:54,297
And there's my cousin-
don't tell me-timothy

2314
02:07:54,365 --> 02:07:55,781
And his two sisters.

2315
02:07:55,849 --> 02:07:58,284
Jehoshaphat, how many cousins do I have?

2316
02:07:58,352 --> 02:08:00,286
That's kathleen
and, um, brigid.

2317
02:08:00,354 --> 02:08:01,787
Bridie.

2318
02:08:01,855 --> 02:08:03,789
Bridie.
Did I get them all?

2319
02:08:03,857 --> 02:08:05,791
That's them all
beneath that roof.

2320
02:08:05,859 --> 02:08:08,944
Will there be room
for me beneath it, too?

2321
02:08:09,012 --> 02:08:10,814
They'll see to that
well enough.

2322
02:08:10,881 --> 02:08:13,383
It's your possessions
I've some doubts about.

2323
02:08:13,450 --> 02:08:15,335
I guess I overdid it,

2324
02:08:15,402 --> 02:08:18,771
But I'll surely find a
place of my own very soon.

2325
02:08:18,839 --> 02:08:22,642
My clothes and I won't be a
bother to anyone, I promise.

2326
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:25,629
I'm doubtful we'll be
able to locate you a house

2327
02:08:25,696 --> 02:08:28,398
To equal what you're
accustomed to, scarlett.

2328
02:08:28,466 --> 02:08:31,668
That's all right.
This is a new life.

2329
02:08:50,003 --> 02:08:52,105
I've got it.

2330
02:08:54,141 --> 02:08:55,775
Come on, get up.

2331
02:09:12,843 --> 02:09:14,277
Go on.
Everything out.

2332
02:09:14,344 --> 02:09:16,679
Don't put that
with the rest.

2333
02:09:16,747 --> 02:09:18,547
Come on, sean,
hurry up.

2334
02:09:20,684 --> 02:09:22,552
Stand back.

2335
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:24,587
There's a bit
of trouble here.

2336
02:09:24,655 --> 02:09:25,722
I won't be long.

2337
02:09:25,789 --> 02:09:27,073
Let me see.

2338
02:09:27,141 --> 02:09:28,642
Stay in the coach.

2339
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:31,060
Don't get out of it
now.

2340
02:09:31,128 --> 02:09:32,628
Come on, everything out.

2341
02:09:32,696 --> 02:09:34,130
Get the table.

2342
02:09:34,198 --> 02:09:37,968
Move along, paddy,
move along.

2343
02:09:39,453 --> 02:09:40,904
You, priest.

2344
02:09:40,971 --> 02:09:43,806
Back in your box
and get on your way.

2345
02:09:43,874 --> 02:09:46,809
I'll just have a word
with the woman, captain.

2346
02:09:46,877 --> 02:09:49,980
You wouldn't deny her a
bit of comfort, would you?

2347
02:09:51,048 --> 02:09:52,499
Don't fret.
Don't fret.

2348
02:09:52,566 --> 02:09:54,000
Please do something.

2349
02:09:54,067 --> 02:09:56,569
I'll send donnelly over for your things.

2350
02:09:56,637 --> 02:09:58,288
We'll find a place
for you.

2351
02:09:58,356 --> 02:10:01,291
Stand clear there.

2352
02:10:01,358 --> 02:10:03,760
Put your backs
into it, men!

2353
02:10:03,827 --> 02:10:05,262
Come on, lads!

2354
02:10:05,329 --> 02:10:07,564
Come on, boys, you're
supposed to be knocking...

2355
02:10:10,551 --> 02:10:13,686
Come on, harder!
Harder! Move it!

2356
02:10:13,754 --> 02:10:15,221
And again!

2357
02:10:15,288 --> 02:10:16,789
Swing it!

2358
02:10:16,857 --> 02:10:18,825
There she goes!

2359
02:10:19,727 --> 02:10:21,844
Harder!

2360
02:10:24,465 --> 02:10:26,015
Come on!

2361
02:10:28,802 --> 02:10:31,170
Torch it!

2362
02:10:50,257 --> 02:10:52,191
Stay in the coach, miss.

2363
02:10:52,259 --> 02:10:54,828
Colum, what in heaven's name
is happening?

2364
02:10:54,895 --> 02:10:56,830
They've destroyed
that poor woman's house.

2365
02:10:56,897 --> 02:10:58,331
It's an eviction,
scarlett.

2366
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:00,333
She hasn't
the rent money.

2367
02:11:00,401 --> 02:11:02,335
Why did they destroy it?

2368
02:11:02,403 --> 02:11:04,838
So's no one
will live in it.

2369
02:11:04,905 --> 02:11:06,339
I don't understand.

2370
02:11:06,407 --> 02:11:07,841
The owner's english.

2371
02:11:07,908 --> 02:11:09,342
The english
own ireland.

2372
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:10,844
You understand that,
don't you?

2373
02:11:10,911 --> 02:11:11,911
Sort of.

2374
02:11:11,979 --> 02:11:14,213
The owner doesn't want
to rent it anymore.

2375
02:11:14,298 --> 02:11:17,249
He's doing what they call
organizing his property.

2376
02:11:17,317 --> 02:11:20,770
First the rent is raised beyond
the possibility of being paid.

2377
02:11:20,838 --> 02:11:22,772
Then the house
is burnt down.

2378
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:25,274
Then the land is set
to grazing cattle.

2379
02:11:25,342 --> 02:11:27,210
That's where
the profits are.

2380
02:11:27,277 --> 02:11:28,628
And that's ireland,
too.

2381
02:11:28,696 --> 02:11:30,697
No beauty about it
whatsoever.

2382
02:11:55,639 --> 02:11:58,291
I thought the driver's name was brendan.

2383
02:11:58,359 --> 02:11:59,759
I beg your pardon?

2384
02:11:59,827 --> 02:12:03,262
When you introduced me to the
driver, you called him brendan,

2385
02:12:03,330 --> 02:12:05,264
But that soldier
called him paddy.

2386
02:12:05,332 --> 02:12:07,767
We're all paddies to the english, scarlett.

2387
02:12:07,835 --> 02:12:11,120
It's comparable to your
despicable term "nigger."

2388
02:12:11,188 --> 02:12:13,622
I never used that word
in my life.

2389
02:12:13,691 --> 02:12:15,457
Pa would've flayed me raw.

2390
02:12:15,525 --> 02:12:18,461
I wasn't referring to you in particular.

2391
02:12:18,529 --> 02:12:20,463
I'm glad to hear it.

2392
02:12:20,531 --> 02:12:23,566
I must say, "paddy"
doesn't sound all that bad,

2393
02:12:23,633 --> 02:12:25,384
Not as bad
as that other.

2394
02:12:25,452 --> 02:12:27,703
You'd have to be irish.

2395
02:12:29,639 --> 02:12:31,007
Whoa!

2396
02:12:32,009 --> 02:12:33,376
Whoa!

2397
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:40,550
Whoa!

2398
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:45,622
Glory,
what was that?

2399
02:12:45,657 --> 02:12:49,158
In far too much of a hurry to be irish.

2400
02:12:49,226 --> 02:12:51,160
That'd be
one of them.

2401
02:12:51,228 --> 02:12:52,094
English?

2402
02:12:52,162 --> 02:12:54,730
You're getting
the lay of the land.

2403
02:13:12,733 --> 02:13:15,385
Whoa.

2404
02:13:19,139 --> 02:13:20,606
Milord.

2405
02:13:39,343 --> 02:13:41,111
Have you brung her?

2406
02:13:47,534 --> 02:13:49,068
Hello, everybody.

2407
02:13:58,696 --> 02:14:00,529
Have you
turned to stone,

2408
02:14:00,597 --> 02:14:03,499
Or are you going to give
the girl the welcome

2409
02:14:03,567 --> 02:14:06,068
She came halfway
around the world for?

2410
02:14:06,136 --> 02:14:09,688
Young katie
scarlett o'hara.

2411
02:14:09,756 --> 02:14:13,142
You honor my house,
and I bid you welcome.

2412
02:14:18,849 --> 02:14:20,283
You must be brigid.

2413
02:14:20,351 --> 02:14:24,154
Bridie.

2414
02:14:24,221 --> 02:14:26,622
You'll be stopping
in my room.

2415
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:28,808
And...Tim.

2416
02:14:28,876 --> 02:14:30,109
That's right.

2417
02:14:30,176 --> 02:14:31,110
Hello, tim.

2418
02:14:31,177 --> 02:14:32,545
I'll get your bags.

2419
02:14:35,315 --> 02:14:37,049
That's katie scarlett.

2420
02:14:42,973 --> 02:14:45,542
Gerald's girl,
is it?

2421
02:14:45,609 --> 02:14:47,576
Come at last.

2422
02:14:47,644 --> 02:14:49,979
And I've lived
to see the day.

2423
02:14:50,046 --> 02:14:51,981
Glory be to god.

2424
02:16:08,876 --> 02:16:11,627
I got your note.

2425
02:16:11,695 --> 02:16:13,263
Evidently.

2426
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:17,166
I came
as soon as I could.

2427
02:16:17,234 --> 02:16:20,069
Soon enough.

2428
02:16:20,137 --> 02:16:21,770
Did you miss me?

2429
02:16:28,412 --> 02:16:30,780
No doubt
you've missed this.

2430
02:16:42,092 --> 02:16:44,243
Here.

2431
02:16:44,311 --> 02:16:46,028
Have a look.

2432
02:16:48,032 --> 02:16:50,699
That's disgusting.

2433
02:16:50,767 --> 02:16:52,452
Take it away.

2434
02:16:54,605 --> 02:16:56,271
Get undressed.

2435
02:17:38,281 --> 02:17:41,217
Would you like a cup of tea, scarlett?

2436
02:17:41,284 --> 02:17:42,818
I'd love it.

2437
02:17:42,886 --> 02:17:44,737
Kathleen,
I got the feeling

2438
02:17:44,804 --> 02:17:46,739
My wardrobe might not
be appropriate

2439
02:17:46,806 --> 02:17:48,791
For living in ireland.

2440
02:17:48,892 --> 02:17:50,826
Your clothes
are beautiful, scarlett,

2441
02:17:50,894 --> 02:17:54,247
But you might be right
in their lack of fitness.

2442
02:17:54,314 --> 02:17:57,250
Would you like the lend
of something of mine?

2443
02:17:57,317 --> 02:17:59,735
Thank you, kathleen.
That's very generous of you,

2444
02:17:59,803 --> 02:18:02,237
But I think I better
do some shopping.

2445
02:18:02,305 --> 02:18:03,739
We could go into town.

2446
02:18:03,807 --> 02:18:05,741
I can't today.
Colum's coming by.

2447
02:18:05,809 --> 02:18:08,243
Is he? Where are you
off to, then?

2448
02:18:08,311 --> 02:18:09,845
He wouldn't tell me.

2449
02:18:09,913 --> 02:18:11,263
Adventuring, he says.

2450
02:18:11,331 --> 02:18:12,765
Well, come on, then.

2451
02:18:12,833 --> 02:18:16,836
We'll find you something more
fit for adventuring than that.

2452
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:22,775
Are you going to tell me
where we're going

2453
02:18:22,843 --> 02:18:24,193
Before we get there?

2454
02:18:24,261 --> 02:18:25,528
I am not.

2455
02:18:25,596 --> 02:18:27,880
If you weren't a priest
and my cousin,

2456
02:18:27,948 --> 02:18:30,382
I could wheedle it out
of you.

2457
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:31,884
Wouldn't I enjoy
the wheedling

2458
02:18:31,952 --> 02:18:34,353
Were I not your cousin
and a priest.

2459
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:35,855
As for your priesthood,

2460
02:18:35,922 --> 02:18:38,858
I'll have to ask you
to do something

2461
02:18:38,925 --> 02:18:41,861
Which I guess will be
difficult for you.

2462
02:18:41,928 --> 02:18:43,863
And what might that be?

2463
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:45,865
I have to tell
a little fib

2464
02:18:45,932 --> 02:18:48,034
And ask you
not to tell anybody

2465
02:18:48,101 --> 02:18:49,368
That's what it is.

2466
02:18:49,435 --> 02:18:50,536
A fib?

2467
02:18:50,603 --> 02:18:53,039
A little white lie
that won't hurt anybody.

2468
02:18:53,106 --> 02:18:55,541
I'm not asking you
to tell it.

2469
02:18:55,608 --> 02:18:56,959
I'm asking you...

2470
02:18:56,994 --> 02:18:59,378
I'm just asking you
not to say anything.

2471
02:18:59,445 --> 02:19:02,214
Will I choke on these words
I'm not to speak?

2472
02:19:02,282 --> 02:19:03,782
I don't see why.

2473
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:07,786
I don't want to be a divorced
woman bearing a child.

2474
02:19:07,854 --> 02:19:09,788
How can you not be that

2475
02:19:09,856 --> 02:19:11,290
If it's what you are?

2476
02:19:11,358 --> 02:19:12,791
I can be a widow.

2477
02:19:12,859 --> 02:19:14,293
I'm going
to tell people

2478
02:19:14,361 --> 02:19:15,794
My husband
recently passed on.

2479
02:19:15,862 --> 02:19:17,796
What'll be
the point of that?

2480
02:19:17,864 --> 02:19:20,299
I don't want to be
a divorced woman

2481
02:19:20,367 --> 02:19:23,802
Bearing the child of a
husband that threw her over.

2482
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:25,304
I simply
cannot bear it.

2483
02:19:25,372 --> 02:19:27,239
Nor will you have to.
Hush now.

2484
02:19:27,307 --> 02:19:28,740
You won't tell?

2485
02:19:28,808 --> 02:19:30,742
It'll be our secret.

2486
02:19:30,810 --> 02:19:32,244
Thank you, colum.
Thank you.

2487
02:19:32,312 --> 02:19:34,746
And there'll not be
a man or woman

2488
02:19:34,814 --> 02:19:37,316
That'll ever
wheedle it out of me.

2489
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:40,953
This is tara.

2490
02:19:41,021 --> 02:19:42,321
Tara?

2491
02:19:42,389 --> 02:19:43,822
The first tara,

2492
02:19:43,890 --> 02:19:46,825
Whose memory your father
brought with him to america.

2493
02:19:46,893 --> 02:19:49,828
You see that row of
ancient stones over there?

2494
02:19:49,896 --> 02:19:51,330
That's all we've left

2495
02:19:51,398 --> 02:19:53,332
Of the great
banqueting hall

2496
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:56,101
That was tara
10 centuries ago.

2497
02:19:56,169 --> 02:20:00,439
Here's where the o'haras
sung first, scarlett.

2498
02:20:00,506 --> 02:20:04,109
And the monaghans,
the mahoneys,

2499
02:20:04,177 --> 02:20:06,545
O'gormans, o'briens,

2500
02:20:06,612 --> 02:20:08,847
The donahues,
the carmodys,

2501
02:20:08,915 --> 02:20:11,283
The heroes.

2502
02:20:11,351 --> 02:20:14,153
All the heroes.

2503
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:16,405
This was tara.

2504
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:23,979
I feel so...Strange,
colum.

2505
02:20:24,047 --> 02:20:26,348
It does that to some.

2506
02:20:26,416 --> 02:20:28,417
What is it?

2507
02:20:28,484 --> 02:20:29,719
Time.

2508
02:20:42,932 --> 02:20:44,366
What are you up to?

2509
02:20:46,186 --> 02:20:48,253
Just something silly,
I guess.

2510
02:21:08,174 --> 02:21:11,109
If only pa could know
where I just stood.

2511
02:21:11,177 --> 02:21:13,111
He does, of course.

2512
02:21:13,179 --> 02:21:15,614
I wish I could
believe that.

2513
02:21:15,682 --> 02:21:18,250
Give it time.

2514
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:20,720
What's this place?

2515
02:21:20,787 --> 02:21:22,655
Ballyhara.

2516
02:21:22,723 --> 02:21:26,174
All this land round
is known as ballyhara.

2517
02:21:26,242 --> 02:21:29,177
200 years ago,
it was our people's land.

2518
02:21:29,245 --> 02:21:30,513
O'hara land.

2519
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:32,981
That's the big house
of ballyhara.

2520
02:21:33,049 --> 02:21:34,550
Does no one live in it?

2521
02:21:34,618 --> 02:21:36,251
No one lives there.
No one will.

2522
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:38,353
What do you mean? Why?

2523
02:21:38,421 --> 02:21:40,523
There's
a dark history on it.

2524
02:21:40,590 --> 02:21:41,757
Tell me.

2525
02:21:41,825 --> 02:21:44,493
You've had enough folklore
for one day, darlin'.

2526
02:21:44,561 --> 02:21:47,529
We don't want
to overdo it, do we?

2527
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:52,201
That's very sad.

2528
02:21:52,269 --> 02:21:53,602
We had no idea.

2529
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:56,839
You have our deepest
condolences, dear scarlett.

2530
02:21:56,907 --> 02:21:57,840
Thank you.

2531
02:21:57,908 --> 02:21:59,391
What a tragedy.

2532
02:21:59,459 --> 02:22:02,394
The husband passed on
whose child you're carrying.

2533
02:22:02,462 --> 02:22:05,481
It would appear I wasn't
meant for marriage.

2534
02:22:05,549 --> 02:22:07,250
All my husbands
have died.

2535
02:22:08,952 --> 02:22:10,652
All?

2536
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:13,122
You've been to the altar more than once?

2537
02:22:13,189 --> 02:22:16,058
Three times,
as a matter of fact.

2538
02:22:16,126 --> 02:22:19,461
And lost them,
every one.

2539
02:22:19,529 --> 02:22:22,381
Glory be to god,
it's like a curse.

2540
02:22:22,449 --> 02:22:24,450
As like as
makes no difference.

2541
02:22:24,517 --> 02:22:27,536
My first two husbands
were nothing like rhett.

2542
02:22:27,604 --> 02:22:30,539
Not to speak ill
of the dead,

2543
02:22:30,607 --> 02:22:32,874
But darling rhett...

2544
02:22:32,943 --> 02:22:34,843
What a man he was.

2545
02:22:34,911 --> 02:22:39,948
He could make a girl dizzy
just thinking about him.

2546
02:22:40,016 --> 02:22:42,935
My other two husbands
were fine and decent men,

2547
02:22:43,003 --> 02:22:47,023
But 10 of 'em couldn't
have made 1 rhett butler.

2548
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:48,524
There's bashing
a tin pot,

2549
02:22:48,592 --> 02:22:50,259
And then
there's music.

2550
02:22:59,436 --> 02:23:01,937
I believe being divorced
by her husband

2551
02:23:02,005 --> 02:23:04,406
Would be one of the most
devastating things

2552
02:23:04,474 --> 02:23:06,408
That could happen
to a woman.

2553
02:23:06,476 --> 02:23:07,976
It depends on the woman.

2554
02:23:08,044 --> 02:23:10,930
As to scarlett, she can
do with being devastated.

2555
02:23:10,997 --> 02:23:13,933
Is it unseemly of me
to speak about it?

2556
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,434
If it is, I'll-

2557
02:23:15,501 --> 02:23:17,602
Not a bit.
Everyone else is.

2558
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:20,772
Heavens, I can't
bite my tongue any longer.

2559
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,274
I just can't.

2560
02:23:22,342 --> 02:23:23,943
It was me.

2561
02:23:24,010 --> 02:23:25,877
I beg your pardon,
my dear?

2562
02:23:25,946 --> 02:23:27,379
Who saw her.

2563
02:23:27,447 --> 02:23:29,348
Scarlett in the hotel.

2564
02:23:29,416 --> 02:23:34,619
I saw scarlett with the man
I now know is ashley wilkes.

2565
02:23:34,687 --> 02:23:36,188
I saw them.

2566
02:23:36,256 --> 02:23:37,957
I was the one who told.

2567
02:23:38,024 --> 02:23:40,125
You don't say.

2568
02:23:40,193 --> 02:23:41,744
I've been driven
to distraction

2569
02:23:41,812 --> 02:23:44,246
Thinking that's the reason
you were divorcing her.

2570
02:23:44,314 --> 02:23:46,748
Because I told
that I saw scarlett.

2571
02:23:46,816 --> 02:23:49,752
Scarlett and I
have been at loggerheads

2572
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:51,921
For some considerable
time now, anne.

2573
02:23:51,988 --> 02:23:53,422
You don't hate me, then?

2574
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:56,191
I could fully understand
if you did,

2575
02:23:56,259 --> 02:23:58,994
Although
it would break my heart.

2576
02:23:59,061 --> 02:24:00,596
Oh, slow down, honey.

2577
02:24:00,663 --> 02:24:02,230
I appreciate you
mentioning it.

2578
02:24:02,298 --> 02:24:04,733
I've spent years
with a woman

2579
02:24:04,801 --> 02:24:07,770
Whose concept of the truth
was severely lackadaisical.

2580
02:24:07,837 --> 02:24:10,439
I find you a real
refreshing change.

2581
02:24:10,507 --> 02:24:11,973
You do?

2582
02:24:12,041 --> 02:24:13,174
Really?

2583
02:24:13,242 --> 02:24:15,277
You bet.

2584
02:24:15,344 --> 02:24:19,548
I feel like a great big hunk of solid rock

2585
02:24:19,616 --> 02:24:21,417
Has been lifted
off my back.

2586
02:24:21,484 --> 02:24:24,586
I'm quite pleased
to relieve you of it.

2587
02:24:24,654 --> 02:24:27,022
Still and all, weren't
you just perfectly furious

2588
02:24:27,090 --> 02:24:28,524
When you heard
about scarlett?

2589
02:24:28,591 --> 02:24:31,527
Scarlett hasn't always
played by the rules, anne,

2590
02:24:31,594 --> 02:24:32,994
But then,
neither have I.

2591
02:24:33,062 --> 02:24:35,347
But she's a woman.

2592
02:24:35,415 --> 02:24:38,484
She certainly is.

2593
02:24:42,873 --> 02:24:46,341
I've thought about what you
were saying this afternoon.

2594
02:24:46,409 --> 02:24:47,776
What did I say?

2595
02:24:47,811 --> 02:24:50,780
About rules.
Playing by the rules.

2596
02:24:52,416 --> 02:24:54,600
In regard to scarlett.

2597
02:24:54,668 --> 02:24:55,834
Uh-huh.

2598
02:24:57,337 --> 02:24:59,271
Well, I got the impression-

2599
02:24:59,339 --> 02:25:02,274
Maybe I'm mistaken,
I could be totally mistaken-

2600
02:25:02,342 --> 02:25:04,776
But I got the impression
you were suggesting

2601
02:25:04,844 --> 02:25:09,364
A woman has the same sort of
prerogatives to take as a man

2602
02:25:09,432 --> 02:25:10,866
By way of behaving.

2603
02:25:10,934 --> 02:25:13,869
Long as she can be
sensible about it.

2604
02:25:13,937 --> 02:25:15,070
About what?

2605
02:25:15,138 --> 02:25:18,040
Whatever comes of her
claiming the prerogative.

2606
02:25:18,107 --> 02:25:20,508
Like what you were saying
about gambling

2607
02:25:20,576 --> 02:25:22,043
And chancing losing?

2608
02:25:22,111 --> 02:25:23,546
And winning.

2609
02:25:23,613 --> 02:25:25,381
And winning. Yes.

2610
02:25:28,718 --> 02:25:30,619
A woman like that's
particularly attractive

2611
02:25:30,686 --> 02:25:32,822
To a certain kind
of man.

2612
02:25:34,357 --> 02:25:35,657
She is?

2613
02:25:35,725 --> 02:25:38,160
What do you think
about that?

2614
02:25:38,228 --> 02:25:39,794
About what?

2615
02:25:39,862 --> 02:25:41,296
About taking
your prerogative

2616
02:25:41,364 --> 02:25:44,333
And the risks
that come with it.

2617
02:25:44,401 --> 02:25:48,337
I guess I don't know
how I feel about it.

2618
02:25:48,405 --> 02:25:52,341
I don't know that I've got
a prerogative to take.

2619
02:25:52,409 --> 02:25:54,343
Sure, you do.

2620
02:25:54,411 --> 02:25:56,011
I do?

2621
02:25:56,079 --> 02:25:59,548
No question
about you having it.

2622
02:25:59,616 --> 02:26:02,651
Only a question
about you taking it.

2623
02:28:23,426 --> 02:28:24,993
Hello there.

2624
02:28:25,962 --> 02:28:27,429
Hello.

2625
02:28:27,496 --> 02:28:30,381
What are you doing?

2626
02:28:30,449 --> 02:28:32,534
Doing?
I'm looking around.

2627
02:28:32,602 --> 02:28:34,319
You're not irish.

2628
02:28:34,386 --> 02:28:35,838
I'm american.

2629
02:28:35,905 --> 02:28:37,322
From the southern
portion

2630
02:28:37,390 --> 02:28:39,841
Of that troubled
land, I take it.

2631
02:28:39,909 --> 02:28:41,092
Georgia.

2632
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:43,195
Ah. You're among
the vanquished

2633
02:28:43,263 --> 02:28:46,148
In the recent unpleasantness
between the states.

2634
02:28:46,216 --> 02:28:47,783
We lost the war, mister.

2635
02:28:47,834 --> 02:28:49,551
Nobody vanquished us.

2636
02:28:51,587 --> 02:28:53,388
I mean no offense,
mrs...

2637
02:28:53,455 --> 02:28:54,790
Butler.
My full name

2638
02:28:54,858 --> 02:28:59,294
And the one I prefer to go by
is scarlett o'hara butler.

2639
02:28:59,361 --> 02:29:03,431
I'm getting a crick in
my neck looking at you.

2640
02:29:03,499 --> 02:29:06,134
In america, a gentleman
dismounts when addressing a lady.

2641
02:29:06,202 --> 02:29:08,203
He also generally
introduces himself

2642
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:12,140
Unless he has some nefarious
reason not to do so.

2643
02:29:16,179 --> 02:29:17,512
Fenton.

2644
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:18,781
Fenton what?

2645
02:29:18,848 --> 02:29:21,283
Actually,
I'm the earl of fenton.

2646
02:29:21,350 --> 02:29:24,286
That's some magnificent
piece of horseflesh

2647
02:29:24,353 --> 02:29:26,221
You're riding there,
earl.

2648
02:29:26,289 --> 02:29:28,723
You know something
of horses, do you?

2649
02:29:28,792 --> 02:29:30,525
More than something.

2650
02:29:31,795 --> 02:29:34,229
This isn't mine.
It belongs to my uncle.

2651
02:29:34,297 --> 02:29:37,732
I'll be getting myself
a proper horse real soon.

2652
02:29:37,801 --> 02:29:40,803
Yes. I should say
that might be advisable.

2653
02:29:44,407 --> 02:29:47,760
This land once belonged
to my family, the o'haras.

2654
02:29:47,827 --> 02:29:49,261
You don't say.

2655
02:29:49,328 --> 02:29:51,263
Maybe some of it
will again.

2656
02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:53,265
And how might that
come about?

2657
02:29:53,332 --> 02:29:54,767
It's called
ballyhara.

2658
02:29:54,834 --> 02:29:56,268
Yes, I know.

2659
02:29:56,403 --> 02:29:58,854
Do you happen
to know who owns it?

2660
02:29:58,922 --> 02:30:01,323
As a matter of fact, I do.

2661
02:30:01,390 --> 02:30:02,758
Why do you ask?

2662
02:30:02,825 --> 02:30:03,759
Just curious.

2663
02:30:03,826 --> 02:30:06,261
How much land
goes with it?

2664
02:30:06,328 --> 02:30:08,764
1,200 acres.

2665
02:30:08,831 --> 02:30:11,266
That's a nice piece
of property.

2666
02:30:11,333 --> 02:30:13,769
It's a wreck of a place.

2667
02:30:13,836 --> 02:30:15,270
Have you been inside?

2668
02:30:15,337 --> 02:30:18,273
I was just looking
for a way in.

2669
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:20,008
Follow me.

2670
02:30:30,453 --> 02:30:31,886
Must've been a grand house

2671
02:30:31,954 --> 02:30:35,390
Before it was left
to go to wrack and ruin.

2672
02:30:35,458 --> 02:30:38,393
Do you know anything of
the history of ballyhara?

2673
02:30:38,461 --> 02:30:40,895
I get the impression
something unpleasant happened,

2674
02:30:40,963 --> 02:30:43,898
But I don't know what.

2675
02:30:43,966 --> 02:30:46,869
It was built by
an englishman, of course.

2676
02:30:46,969 --> 02:30:49,321
The house passed from
generation to generation

2677
02:30:49,389 --> 02:30:51,323
Until the time
of the famine.

2678
02:30:51,391 --> 02:30:54,409
Are you familiar with
the famine here in ireland?

2679
02:30:54,477 --> 02:30:57,112
My pa told us
all about it.

2680
02:30:58,648 --> 02:31:00,582
The then lord
of ballyhara

2681
02:31:00,650 --> 02:31:02,084
Was unable, it seems,

2682
02:31:02,151 --> 02:31:04,986
To bear the horrors
of starvation and death.

2683
02:31:05,054 --> 02:31:06,488
He bought a ship

2684
02:31:06,556 --> 02:31:09,991
To provide free passage
to america for his tenants,

2685
02:31:10,059 --> 02:31:11,493
Their families,

2686
02:31:11,561 --> 02:31:14,196
Anyone who cared
to take advantage

2687
02:31:14,263 --> 02:31:17,765
Of his pity and largess.

2688
02:31:17,833 --> 02:31:20,001
Many did.

2689
02:31:20,069 --> 02:31:22,504
The exact number
was never known,

2690
02:31:22,572 --> 02:31:24,005
Surely in the hundreds,

2691
02:31:24,073 --> 02:31:27,041
But they all drowned
when the ship went down

2692
02:31:27,109 --> 02:31:28,943
In the first heavy sea
encountered.

2693
02:31:29,011 --> 02:31:30,445
Oh, my lord.

2694
02:31:30,513 --> 02:31:31,946
Not long after,

2695
02:31:32,014 --> 02:31:34,949
The lord of ballyhara
was found in the stable,

2696
02:31:35,017 --> 02:31:37,952
Bound hand and foot
and hung from a rafter.

2697
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:39,454
The act, of course,

2698
02:31:39,522 --> 02:31:43,925
Of a handful of demented
paddies bound on revenge.

2699
02:31:43,992 --> 02:31:46,878
Of course, there was
retribution for the murder.

2700
02:31:46,946 --> 02:31:48,964
Five men from the village

2701
02:31:49,031 --> 02:31:51,383
Were chosen at random
and hanged.

2702
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:52,885
Hanged? By who?

2703
02:31:52,952 --> 02:31:54,386
By the legal
representatives

2704
02:31:54,453 --> 02:31:56,872
Of the british crown,
of course.

2705
02:31:56,939 --> 02:31:59,374
That was all
30 years ago.

2706
02:31:59,441 --> 02:32:01,877
The house hasn't
been occupied since.

2707
02:32:01,944 --> 02:32:05,080
The local witchery
has it, inevitably,

2708
02:32:05,148 --> 02:32:09,050
That the house
is haunted.

2709
02:32:10,703 --> 02:32:12,187
Well, considering
that story,

2710
02:32:12,254 --> 02:32:15,190
If any place had a right
to be haunted,

2711
02:32:15,257 --> 02:32:16,607
I guess it would be ballyhara.

2712
02:32:16,675 --> 02:32:20,611
And should we have a chance
to meet again after today,

2713
02:32:20,679 --> 02:32:24,615
Don't you dare use the word
paddy in my presence again.

2714
02:32:24,683 --> 02:32:26,551
Have I encountered
a fenian heart

2715
02:32:26,618 --> 02:32:28,053
In an american
breast, then?

2716
02:32:28,120 --> 02:32:29,054
A what?

2717
02:32:29,121 --> 02:32:30,555
The word's
unfamiliar to you?

2718
02:32:30,622 --> 02:32:32,057
Fenian?

2719
02:32:32,124 --> 02:32:33,791
The fenian brotherhood,

2720
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:35,293
A secret irish society

2721
02:32:35,361 --> 02:32:38,296
Dedicated to the violent
and bloody overthrow

2722
02:32:38,364 --> 02:32:40,298
Of british rule
in ireland,

2723
02:32:40,366 --> 02:32:43,802
Knowing full well the mayhem
inherent in that hopeless wish.

2724
02:32:43,870 --> 02:32:46,805
I don't want anything
to do with politics.

2725
02:32:46,873 --> 02:32:48,807
That's very wise
of you.

2726
02:32:48,875 --> 02:32:50,308
Ghosts or no ghosts,

2727
02:32:50,376 --> 02:32:52,811
I'd still like to
speak to the owner.

2728
02:32:52,879 --> 02:32:54,178
You are.

2729
02:32:56,015 --> 02:32:59,134
The man who was hanged
was my father.

2730
02:33:00,937 --> 02:33:03,371
May I offer you
some lunch, mrs. Butler?

2731
02:33:03,438 --> 02:33:05,439
We aren't far
from fenton hall.

2732
02:33:06,825 --> 02:33:09,978
The way it looks now
reminds me of our homes

2733
02:33:10,045 --> 02:33:11,729
After the yankees
passed through,

2734
02:33:11,797 --> 02:33:13,231
Except the state
ballyhara's in

2735
02:33:13,299 --> 02:33:15,817
Is the result of
nothing more than neglect.

2736
02:33:15,852 --> 02:33:18,236
Anyone can see
what a beautiful place

2737
02:33:18,304 --> 02:33:19,738
It must have been once.

2738
02:33:19,805 --> 02:33:22,240
I know how you feel
about the english,

2739
02:33:22,308 --> 02:33:25,243
But they sure know how
to build houses.

2740
02:33:25,311 --> 02:33:28,179
What's this I hear
about it being haunted?

2741
02:33:28,247 --> 02:33:31,249
Has anyone actually seen
a ghost at ballyhara?

2742
02:33:34,853 --> 02:33:37,789
Now I know what's different
about supper tonight-

2743
02:33:37,856 --> 02:33:40,792
I'm the only one talking.
What's going on?

2744
02:33:40,859 --> 02:33:42,294
Something happened?

2745
02:33:42,361 --> 02:33:44,362
Did somebody die?

2746
02:33:48,051 --> 02:33:50,452
Are we going
to sit here like lumps

2747
02:33:50,519 --> 02:33:52,987
Or will we have it out?

2748
02:33:53,055 --> 02:33:54,990
You're known
to have been consorting

2749
02:33:55,058 --> 02:33:58,059
With the master of
fenton hall today, scarlett.

2750
02:33:58,127 --> 02:34:00,061
Consorting?

2751
02:34:00,129 --> 02:34:02,564
What's that supposed to mean, consorting?

2752
02:34:02,631 --> 02:34:05,067
I met him by accident at ballyhara,

2753
02:34:05,134 --> 02:34:07,569
And he invited me
home for lunch.

2754
02:34:07,636 --> 02:34:09,571
How did you
know about it?

2755
02:34:09,638 --> 02:34:12,173
Scarlett, there's
nothing happens here

2756
02:34:12,241 --> 02:34:15,177
That the whole county
doesn't know about

2757
02:34:15,244 --> 02:34:17,112
By the fall of dark.

2758
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:20,214
Best to keep it in mind
for future referral.

2759
02:34:20,282 --> 02:34:21,616
Now, look here.

2760
02:34:21,684 --> 02:34:24,118
I'm real fond
of all of you,

2761
02:34:24,186 --> 02:34:26,054
And I have
the greatest respect

2762
02:34:26,121 --> 02:34:28,056
For your feelings
about the english.

2763
02:34:28,123 --> 02:34:30,058
But I have
a slight objection

2764
02:34:30,125 --> 02:34:32,561
About being told
who I can talk to.

2765
02:34:32,628 --> 02:34:33,862
And right she is.

2766
02:34:33,929 --> 02:34:36,898
Miss scarlett's got nothing
to do with our troubles.

2767
02:34:36,966 --> 02:34:38,299
Can she be among us

2768
02:34:38,418 --> 02:34:40,869
And have nothing
to do with 'em?

2769
02:34:40,937 --> 02:34:43,137
It's her decision
to make.

2770
02:34:43,205 --> 02:34:46,608
Stop talking about me as
though I were somewhere else.

2771
02:34:46,676 --> 02:34:49,110
But you're not somewhere else, darlin',

2772
02:34:49,178 --> 02:34:51,446
And that's
the point of it.

2773
02:34:51,514 --> 02:34:53,615
I don't care
about politics.

2774
02:34:53,683 --> 02:34:56,484
Politics! Is it politics
you call it, woman?

2775
02:34:56,551 --> 02:34:57,786
Father!

2776
02:34:57,853 --> 02:35:01,623
Nothing was e'er heard
any the better for shouting.

2777
02:35:01,691 --> 02:35:03,625
Yes, that's what
I call it.

2778
02:35:03,693 --> 02:35:05,627
I've seen
what it can do.

2779
02:35:05,695 --> 02:35:08,129
From fort sumter
to the terrible day

2780
02:35:08,197 --> 02:35:10,632
General lee handed
over his sword

2781
02:35:10,700 --> 02:35:12,133
At appomattox
courthouse.

2782
02:35:12,201 --> 02:35:13,635
And millions dead
between.

2783
02:35:13,703 --> 02:35:15,153
And ruination
and despair.

2784
02:35:15,221 --> 02:35:16,671
I've had
my bellyful,

2785
02:35:16,739 --> 02:35:18,773
And I'll have
no more!

2786
02:35:25,815 --> 02:35:27,549
I'm sorry for shouting.

2787
02:35:30,686 --> 02:35:35,490
Call it politics if
that's your need, scarlett,

2788
02:35:35,558 --> 02:35:39,927
But what we're about here
is human suffering.

2789
02:35:43,066 --> 02:35:44,999
After the hanging
and the murders,

2790
02:35:45,068 --> 02:35:47,502
Fenton's mother took
him and his sister away

2791
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:49,003
To live in England.

2792
02:35:49,072 --> 02:35:51,005
That's still
his real home place.

2793
02:35:51,074 --> 02:35:53,007
But five years
or so ago,

2794
02:35:53,076 --> 02:35:56,511
He bought fenton hall,
as he came to call it.

2795
02:35:56,579 --> 02:35:59,013
He passes a fair bit
of time there.

2796
02:35:59,082 --> 02:36:01,516
I get the impression
he's not well liked.

2797
02:36:01,584 --> 02:36:04,519
No more or less
than the rest of 'em,

2798
02:36:04,587 --> 02:36:07,021
But you shouldn't encourage
an association with him.

2799
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:08,523
God's nightgown!
You, too?

2800
02:36:08,591 --> 02:36:11,025
I'm not encouraging
anything with him.

2801
02:36:11,094 --> 02:36:12,860
All's well, then.

2802
02:36:15,264 --> 02:36:16,698
Home, sweet home...

2803
02:36:16,766 --> 02:36:19,768
Should you choose
to call it that.

2804
02:36:26,108 --> 02:36:28,042
There's a
sleeping chamber there.

2805
02:36:28,110 --> 02:36:31,545
It could do with a few
more sticks of furniture.

2806
02:36:31,613 --> 02:36:33,631
Will it do,
do you think?

2807
02:36:33,699 --> 02:36:35,016
It'll do just fine, colum.

2808
02:36:35,084 --> 02:36:39,087
Now, where can I buy
a good horse and a trap?

2809
02:36:49,248 --> 02:36:50,748
Whoa.

2810
02:36:55,321 --> 02:36:56,321
Evening.

2811
02:37:02,211 --> 02:37:03,544
You're getting what?

2812
02:37:03,612 --> 02:37:06,514
It's my duty
to marry her, belle.

2813
02:37:06,582 --> 02:37:09,016
Jumping jones!
You're gonna tell me

2814
02:37:09,084 --> 02:37:11,586
You got that girl
in the family way?

2815
02:37:11,653 --> 02:37:13,121
Of course not.

2816
02:37:13,189 --> 02:37:16,007
Then what do you mean,
it's your duty?

2817
02:37:16,074 --> 02:37:18,759
I told you.
I compromised her.

2818
02:37:18,828 --> 02:37:21,329
You didn't force yourself
on her, did you?

2819
02:37:21,397 --> 02:37:23,965
You know better
than to ask that.

2820
02:37:24,033 --> 02:37:26,551
I sure do,
and I apologize.

2821
02:37:26,618 --> 02:37:28,570
Is she ragging on you

2822
02:37:28,604 --> 02:37:31,072
To make
an honest woman of her?

2823
02:37:31,139 --> 02:37:34,992
Maybe she's making
an honest man of me.

2824
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:36,727
Oh, rhett...

2825
02:37:36,795 --> 02:37:38,813
Gonna be terrible
for your reputation

2826
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:40,982
If that ever gets around.

2827
02:37:44,553 --> 02:37:45,987
Terrible.

2828
02:37:49,291 --> 02:37:51,726
They're all just
adorable, mrs. Scanlon.

2829
02:37:51,794 --> 02:37:53,394
This one especially.

2830
02:37:53,462 --> 02:37:54,528
When's the baby
coming?

2831
02:37:54,596 --> 02:37:55,529
November.

2832
02:37:55,597 --> 02:37:57,832
Ladies?

2833
02:37:57,899 --> 02:37:59,567
Good morning, father.

2834
02:37:59,635 --> 02:38:00,735
Colum.

2835
02:38:00,803 --> 02:38:02,737
Is she buying out
the shop?

2836
02:38:02,805 --> 02:38:05,606
Just baby stuff thus far,
but I'm still hoping.

2837
02:38:05,674 --> 02:38:07,209
I'm only pulling your leg.

2838
02:38:07,276 --> 02:38:08,710
I should hope so

2839
02:38:08,778 --> 02:38:12,213
After what I bought for
myself not two weeks ago.

2840
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:15,450
No one could complain of
your costume, mrs. Butler.

2841
02:38:15,518 --> 02:38:18,336
I can't decide.
I'll take them all.

2842
02:38:18,404 --> 02:38:20,839
And there's
the proof of it.

2843
02:38:20,906 --> 02:38:24,275
Come on.
I need your help.

2844
02:38:37,205 --> 02:38:39,007
Good morning, ma'am.

2845
02:38:45,681 --> 02:38:47,999
How much will you take
for ballyhara?

2846
02:38:48,067 --> 02:38:50,518
Are you quite serious?

2847
02:38:50,585 --> 02:38:52,186
Let's find out.

2848
02:38:56,458 --> 02:38:57,959
Have you heard?

2849
02:38:59,728 --> 02:39:01,112
Have you heard?

2850
02:39:01,180 --> 02:39:02,480
Heard what?

2851
02:39:02,547 --> 02:39:03,815
It's...

2852
02:39:03,883 --> 02:39:05,383
Ballyhara!

2853
02:39:06,618 --> 02:39:09,053
Have you heard?

2854
02:39:09,121 --> 02:39:12,056
The o'hara woman has just
made purchase of ballyhara

2855
02:39:12,124 --> 02:39:14,793
And a thousand acres
with it!

2856
02:39:14,860 --> 02:39:17,679
Have you been doing your
drinking elsewhere today?

2857
02:39:17,746 --> 02:39:20,715
O'brien must've been talking
to the little people again.

2858
02:39:21,750 --> 02:39:23,083
But it's the truth!

2859
02:39:23,151 --> 02:39:26,538
I've had it from the lips
of father colum himself!

2860
02:39:26,605 --> 02:39:28,690
Would you call him
a liar?

2861
02:39:28,757 --> 02:39:30,324
If you're
pulling our legs,

2862
02:39:30,326 --> 02:39:33,261
We'll hang you from the
rafters by both of yours.

2863
02:39:33,328 --> 02:39:35,229
May I be struck dead

2864
02:39:35,297 --> 02:39:37,298
If I'm not
telling the truth.

2865
02:39:37,366 --> 02:39:38,866
I believe he is.

2866
02:39:38,884 --> 02:39:40,902
And there's
plenty of work

2867
02:39:40,970 --> 02:39:43,538
For every man jack
as wants it,

2868
02:39:43,606 --> 02:39:46,207
Putting it back
to its former state.

2869
02:39:46,242 --> 02:39:48,209
And farms to be had

2870
02:39:48,277 --> 02:39:50,111
At rents
that'll never rise!

2871
02:39:50,178 --> 02:39:51,746
That's her promise.

2872
02:39:51,814 --> 02:39:54,448
Well, here's to
scarlett o'hara, then.

2873
02:39:54,516 --> 02:39:56,350
God bless her rare soul

2874
02:39:56,418 --> 02:39:58,953
Who's took back
what was took from us

2875
02:39:59,021 --> 02:40:01,221
And made it irish
once more!

2876
02:40:01,289 --> 02:40:03,758
Yay! Yay! Yay!

2877
02:40:15,671 --> 02:40:18,172
Now's as good a time
as any.

2878
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:20,208
Consider the risk
in trusting her.

2879
02:40:20,276 --> 02:40:21,976
Where's the risk,
man?

2880
02:40:22,043 --> 02:40:24,813
Do you supposed she'll
go running to the barracks

2881
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:25,813
Hollering sedition?

2882
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:28,449
There's no
chance of that.

2883
02:40:28,517 --> 02:40:30,501
She might turn us down.

2884
02:40:30,568 --> 02:40:32,336
What do you think, colum?

2885
02:40:32,404 --> 02:40:35,189
I think the risk's
more hers than ours.

2886
02:40:35,257 --> 02:40:36,691
How do you figure that?

2887
02:40:36,759 --> 02:40:39,060
Were she to be
discovered helping us...

2888
02:40:39,128 --> 02:40:40,695
She'd know
that risk.

2889
02:40:40,763 --> 02:40:42,697
It's for her
to decide.

2890
02:40:42,764 --> 02:40:44,982
I say now's the time.

2891
02:40:52,007 --> 02:40:55,943
Are you having relations
with the o'hara woman?

2892
02:40:56,011 --> 02:40:58,278
Don't be impertinent.

2893
02:40:58,346 --> 02:41:01,249
I was only wondering.

2894
02:41:01,317 --> 02:41:04,251
You're not here to wonder.

2895
02:41:04,319 --> 02:41:06,253
There's some
whispering it about

2896
02:41:06,321 --> 02:41:08,322
As to you and her.

2897
02:41:17,766 --> 02:41:20,067
Be quiet.

2898
02:41:21,603 --> 02:41:23,604
I want to go now.

2899
02:41:32,380 --> 02:41:33,914
Not yet.

2900
02:41:43,292 --> 02:41:45,026
No! Let me go!

2901
02:41:45,094 --> 02:41:46,527
Let me go!

2902
02:41:46,595 --> 02:41:48,029
Come on, move it.

2903
02:41:48,097 --> 02:41:50,031
We're doing it!

2904
02:41:50,099 --> 02:41:51,532
What are you doing?

2905
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:52,900
What's going on here?

2906
02:41:52,968 --> 02:41:54,602
Scarlett,
we're being evicted!

2907
02:41:54,669 --> 02:41:56,237
Evicted?
What the devil for?

2908
02:41:56,305 --> 02:41:58,539
Where's uncle daniel
and tim?

2909
02:41:58,607 --> 02:42:00,141
Someone's gone
to get them.

2910
02:42:00,209 --> 02:42:02,143
I needn't inquire
as to your identity.

2911
02:42:02,211 --> 02:42:03,794
I presume
you're the american woman.

2912
02:42:03,862 --> 02:42:05,196
You presume right.

2913
02:42:05,264 --> 02:42:07,465
What are you doing
to these people?

2914
02:42:07,533 --> 02:42:09,066
I'm executing an order

2915
02:42:09,134 --> 02:42:11,069
On behalf of
her majesty's government

2916
02:42:11,136 --> 02:42:13,955
For the eviction of persons
resident on this property

2917
02:42:14,022 --> 02:42:16,674
For their having fallen
in arrears on the rent.

2918
02:42:16,742 --> 02:42:19,160
Now, stand aside,
please, miss.

2919
02:42:19,227 --> 02:42:20,895
Are you in arrears,
kathleen?

2920
02:42:21,029 --> 02:42:23,063
God help us,
we are, scarlett.

2921
02:42:23,131 --> 02:42:24,064
How much?

2922
02:42:24,132 --> 02:42:25,399
I beg your pardon?

2923
02:42:25,467 --> 02:42:27,835
It's their pardon
you should be begging.

2924
02:42:27,903 --> 02:42:29,904
How much in arrears
are they?

2925
02:42:29,972 --> 02:42:31,939
Constable?

2926
02:42:33,442 --> 02:42:37,578
7 pounds, 8 shillings, 9 pence.

2927
02:42:46,505 --> 02:42:49,323
Well, do you want it,
or don't you?

2928
02:42:55,581 --> 02:42:58,349
I don't have 9 pence.
You can keep the change.

2929
02:43:12,814 --> 02:43:15,349
By his glory be
to god,

2930
02:43:15,417 --> 02:43:18,952
But doesn't she
just take the cake?

2931
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:22,723
I'll pay you back
every penny.

2932
02:43:22,791 --> 02:43:25,726
I swear it
on my father's grave.

2933
02:43:25,794 --> 02:43:28,162
Why didn't you tell me
you needed money?

2934
02:43:28,230 --> 02:43:29,864
I'd have helped you.

2935
02:43:29,932 --> 02:43:32,166
I'll not take charity,
scarlett.

2936
02:43:32,234 --> 02:43:33,767
It's family, uncle daniel.

2937
02:43:33,835 --> 02:43:36,404
There's no charity
in family.

2938
02:43:36,472 --> 02:43:40,040
Nevertheless,
every penny.

2939
02:43:40,109 --> 02:43:41,542
All right, then.

2940
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:45,413
Maybe we can make
some kind of an arrangement.

2941
02:43:47,215 --> 02:43:48,883
What would that be?

2942
02:43:48,951 --> 02:43:51,986
Will you come farm
a piece of my land?

2943
02:43:54,823 --> 02:43:56,324
The rent will be better,

2944
02:43:56,391 --> 02:43:57,825
Not only for you.

2945
02:43:57,892 --> 02:44:00,428
For anyone who comes
as tenant at ballyhara.

2946
02:44:00,495 --> 02:44:02,930
Put the difference
between your rent here

2947
02:44:02,998 --> 02:44:05,833
And the rent there
toward paying me back.

2948
02:44:05,901 --> 02:44:08,736
It's fine land
up there.

2949
02:44:08,804 --> 02:44:10,905
It's o'hara land.

2950
02:44:15,243 --> 02:44:16,778
Every penny, mind.

2951
02:44:16,845 --> 02:44:18,379
And a bit more.

2952
02:44:18,447 --> 02:44:21,098
I didn't have
the exact change.

2953
02:44:33,462 --> 02:44:35,463
Daniel,
coming up.

2954
02:44:39,635 --> 02:44:41,469
I got that one.

2955
02:44:44,005 --> 02:44:45,673
There she goes.

2956
02:44:47,443 --> 02:44:48,376
Ready?

2957
02:44:48,444 --> 02:44:50,211
Hurry up.

2958
02:45:09,615 --> 02:45:11,048
Want some lunch?

2959
02:45:11,116 --> 02:45:12,550
I just come by

2960
02:45:12,618 --> 02:45:15,553
To tell you I'll be
away for a while.

2961
02:45:15,621 --> 02:45:16,721
Away? Where?

2962
02:45:16,789 --> 02:45:17,722
America.

2963
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:19,324
Boston, philadelphia.

2964
02:45:19,391 --> 02:45:20,825
Don't be gone too long.

2965
02:45:20,892 --> 02:45:22,827
Only as long
as is needed.

2966
02:45:22,894 --> 02:45:24,829
It's coming along.

2967
02:45:24,896 --> 02:45:26,163
Not fast enough.

2968
02:45:26,231 --> 02:45:27,665
Fast is a word

2969
02:45:27,733 --> 02:45:29,166
You'll find
mysteriously absent

2970
02:45:29,234 --> 02:45:31,552
From the irish
vocabulary, darlin'.

2971
02:45:33,388 --> 02:45:37,324
You'll be needing help running
a house the size of this.

2972
02:45:37,392 --> 02:45:40,828
I've taken the liberty
of arranging that for you.

2973
02:45:40,896 --> 02:45:42,463
Rosaleen fitzpatrick's
her name.

2974
02:45:42,530 --> 02:45:46,083
Formerly head housekeeper on
an estate by trim, near laracor.

2975
02:45:46,151 --> 02:45:47,584
I'm much obliged,
colum.

2976
02:45:47,652 --> 02:45:49,086
I hadn't thought
of that.

2977
02:45:49,154 --> 02:45:51,588
I'll have her drop by
at your convenience.

2978
02:45:51,656 --> 02:45:53,590
I have other news as well.

2979
02:45:53,658 --> 02:45:57,094
I've had a letter from
savannah from tommy shannon,

2980
02:45:57,162 --> 02:46:00,597
The works foreman on the new
cathedral being built there.

2981
02:46:00,665 --> 02:46:02,099
It concerns your tara.

2982
02:46:02,167 --> 02:46:04,101
It's about time.
What's the news?

2983
02:46:04,169 --> 02:46:07,604
Faced with a retarded pace
of work on the cathedral,

2984
02:46:07,672 --> 02:46:10,107
As was hinted
as a possibility by tommy,

2985
02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:11,608
The bishop
reconsidered your proposal

2986
02:46:11,676 --> 02:46:14,111
To buy back
your sister's share of tara

2987
02:46:14,179 --> 02:46:17,414
And will enter into
negotiations on a fair price.

2988
02:46:17,482 --> 02:46:19,066
Hallelujah.

2989
02:46:20,635 --> 02:46:23,104
Won't all this alter
your plans somewhat?

2990
02:46:23,171 --> 02:46:24,105
How?

2991
02:46:24,172 --> 02:46:25,606
You seem to be amassing

2992
02:46:25,673 --> 02:46:27,408
A considerable amount
of property.

2993
02:46:27,476 --> 02:46:28,909
Colum,
what we're standing on

2994
02:46:28,977 --> 02:46:30,911
Was here
a million years ago.

2995
02:46:30,979 --> 02:46:35,449
How can anyone have too much of
anything that lasts that long?

2996
02:46:35,517 --> 02:46:37,935
Never thought of it
quite like that,

2997
02:46:38,003 --> 02:46:41,422
But I don't know of any
but you who would.

2998
02:46:41,489 --> 02:46:44,524
You'll be needing
considerable staff, of course.

2999
02:46:44,592 --> 02:46:46,460
I don't know about
considerable.

3000
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:48,446
Just someone
to run the place,

3001
02:46:48,513 --> 02:46:50,948
And I'm assuming that'll
be you, mrs. Fitzpatrick.

3002
02:46:51,015 --> 02:46:53,951
I'll only be using
a few rooms at first.

3003
02:46:54,018 --> 02:46:55,786
When'll the child
be coming?

3004
02:46:55,854 --> 02:46:57,288
I judge October
or thereabouts.

3005
02:46:57,356 --> 02:46:59,790
That's what I'm figuring on
- around late October.

3006
02:46:59,858 --> 02:47:01,292
They've got to finish up

3007
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:03,794
Enough for me
to move in before then.

3008
02:47:03,862 --> 02:47:04,928
Why is that?

3009
02:47:04,996 --> 02:47:07,998
I want my baby
to be born here.

3010
02:47:10,168 --> 02:47:12,102
You'll be needing
a steward

3011
02:47:12,170 --> 02:47:15,105
To manage the butler,
the footmen, and the like,

3012
02:47:15,173 --> 02:47:17,591
And a head stableman
to supervise the grooms.

3013
02:47:17,659 --> 02:47:20,627
How many horses have you
in mind to have?

3014
02:47:20,695 --> 02:47:23,614
I haven't gotten around to
thinking about horses yet.

3015
02:47:23,682 --> 02:47:25,616
I'm late in expressing
my pleasure

3016
02:47:25,684 --> 02:47:28,052
At meeting you and
being in your employ.

3017
02:47:28,119 --> 02:47:32,940
It would be an honor to be
housekeeper for the o'hara.

3018
02:47:33,008 --> 02:47:34,441
Beg your pardon?

3019
02:47:34,509 --> 02:47:37,945
I say I'll be honored being
housekeeper for the o'hara.

3020
02:47:38,013 --> 02:47:39,947
<i>The o'hara?
What do you mean?</i>

3021
02:47:40,015 --> 02:47:41,548
Are you not aware, then?

3022
02:47:41,616 --> 02:47:42,966
You're called
the o'hara now,

3023
02:47:43,034 --> 02:47:45,952
Head of the family o'hara
and all its branches.

3024
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:48,989
A rare grace it is,
you being a woman.

3025
02:47:49,057 --> 02:47:51,492
Hasn't been a female
borne the title

3026
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:53,494
In over 100 years or more.

3027
02:47:53,562 --> 02:47:56,497
Ye gods!
What do I have to do?

3028
02:47:56,565 --> 02:47:57,998
Some will come to you

3029
02:47:58,066 --> 02:48:00,000
With various troubles
now and again.

3030
02:48:00,068 --> 02:48:02,503
There'll be the odd
squabble amongst families

3031
02:48:02,571 --> 02:48:05,105
That might be needing
your attention.

3032
02:48:05,173 --> 02:48:08,609
There may be occasional
intercessions with the landlord

3033
02:48:08,677 --> 02:48:10,110
Asked of you.

3034
02:48:10,178 --> 02:48:12,112
Nothing that
you're not equal to,

3035
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:14,615
From what I've heard
of you thus far.

3036
02:48:14,683 --> 02:48:16,116
Well, I'll do my best,

3037
02:48:16,184 --> 02:48:19,620
But what I'd be equal to
right now is lunch.

3038
02:48:19,688 --> 02:48:21,521
Let's drop into the pub.

3039
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:24,024
Well, now...

3040
02:48:24,092 --> 02:48:27,394
Women are rare enough
in carney's, mrs. Butler,

3041
02:48:27,462 --> 02:48:29,396
And never unescorted.

3042
02:48:29,464 --> 02:48:31,098
But I'm the o'hara.

3043
02:48:47,582 --> 02:48:49,983
Afternoon.

3044
02:48:59,244 --> 02:49:02,129
Here's to ya!

3045
02:49:02,197 --> 02:49:04,665
God bless the o'hara!

3046
02:49:33,028 --> 02:49:34,528
You hurt me.

3047
02:49:37,065 --> 02:49:38,532
Get dressed.

3048
02:49:39,501 --> 02:49:42,069
Are you done with me
for this evening,

3049
02:49:42,136 --> 02:49:43,537
Lord fenton, sir?

3050
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:47,741
Get dressed.

3051
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:50,678
You hurt me.

3052
02:50:08,663 --> 02:50:10,664
God bless all here.

3053
02:50:11,666 --> 02:50:12,566
Colum.

3054
02:50:12,633 --> 02:50:13,567
Whoa.

3055
02:50:13,635 --> 02:50:14,601
Colum.

3056
02:50:14,669 --> 02:50:16,136
You're back.

3057
02:50:17,572 --> 02:50:19,507
How are you?

3058
02:50:19,574 --> 02:50:20,608
Welcome.

3059
02:50:20,675 --> 02:50:22,475
I missed you so.

3060
02:50:22,543 --> 02:50:24,478
So how was boston?

3061
02:50:24,546 --> 02:50:26,146
And philadelphia,
was it?

3062
02:50:26,214 --> 02:50:28,915
Quite civilized,
I'm pleased to report.

3063
02:50:28,983 --> 02:50:33,020
You sure travel far afield to save souls.

3064
02:50:33,088 --> 02:50:37,524
If this little creature was kicking
me like that from the outset,

3065
02:50:37,592 --> 02:50:39,026
I'd be black and blue.

3066
02:50:39,094 --> 02:50:40,027
Poor lamb.

3067
02:50:40,095 --> 02:50:41,528
How much longer?

3068
02:50:41,596 --> 02:50:43,431
About three weeks,
I reckon.

3069
02:50:43,498 --> 02:50:46,434
Will you have your wish
as to the birthplace?

3070
02:50:46,501 --> 02:50:49,437
I will. The whole house isn't finished yet,

3071
02:50:49,504 --> 02:50:52,940
But enough so's I'll have my
baby 'neath ballyhara's roof.

3072
02:50:53,007 --> 02:50:56,510
Be sure to stay beneath it
the night of allhallows eve.

3073
02:50:56,578 --> 02:50:58,011
Why? What's that?

3074
02:50:58,079 --> 02:51:00,280
The same as
your Halloween,

3075
02:51:00,349 --> 02:51:03,950
Though we take it more
seriously than you do.

3076
02:51:04,018 --> 02:51:05,952
It's coming
a week Saturday.

3077
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:09,589
Stay in your house with
your doors shut tight.

3078
02:51:09,657 --> 02:51:12,576
That's when all the goblins and ghosts

3079
02:51:12,644 --> 02:51:15,312
And spirits from
all the times come out,

3080
02:51:15,379 --> 02:51:18,032
Some carrying their
heads beneath their arms

3081
02:51:18,133 --> 02:51:19,933
And all other
unnatural things.

3082
02:51:20,001 --> 02:51:21,819
Colum.

3083
02:51:21,887 --> 02:51:22,987
Oh, well.

3084
02:51:23,054 --> 02:51:25,990
Perhaps you're not
quite irish enough yet.

3085
02:51:28,093 --> 02:51:31,011
There's some plaster
needed on the walls,

3086
02:51:31,078 --> 02:51:34,915
But with a good fire in the
hearth and cheerful curtains,

3087
02:51:34,982 --> 02:51:37,918
The room will afford
quite reasonable comfort.

3088
02:51:37,985 --> 02:51:39,920
And there's
a surprise for you.

3089
02:51:39,987 --> 02:51:42,489
We found it
in the attic.

3090
02:51:47,995 --> 02:51:49,930
Sweet mercy,
what is it?

3091
02:51:49,997 --> 02:51:51,432
It's a state bed,

3092
02:51:51,499 --> 02:51:54,435
Probably made specially for
the viceroy's visit years ago.

3093
02:51:54,502 --> 02:51:55,436
Who's that?

3094
02:51:55,503 --> 02:51:57,521
The head of the government
in ireland.

3095
02:51:57,589 --> 02:51:58,955
I've ordered
a comfy mattress.

3096
02:51:59,023 --> 02:52:00,541
I could sleep in this

3097
02:52:00,609 --> 02:52:03,043
And never hit
the same spot twice.

3098
02:52:03,111 --> 02:52:05,545
The bed wants
more than one in it.

3099
02:52:05,613 --> 02:52:08,048
Mrs. Fitzpatrick, whatever
are you suggesting?

3100
02:52:08,116 --> 02:52:09,316
Ooh!

3101
02:52:12,303 --> 02:52:15,956
I trust there's been no
signs of ghosts as yet.

3102
02:52:16,024 --> 02:52:17,091
Not yet.

3103
02:52:17,158 --> 02:52:19,559
They're probably waiting
till I get settled in

3104
02:52:19,627 --> 02:52:22,062
Before they make
their presence known.

3105
02:52:22,130 --> 02:52:23,480
Do you believe
in ghosts?

3106
02:52:23,548 --> 02:52:27,001
I don't believe in them,
but I'm scared of them.

3107
02:52:27,068 --> 02:52:28,502
Have you a preference?

3108
02:52:28,569 --> 02:52:30,504
I'm hoping for a girl.

3109
02:52:30,571 --> 02:52:34,508
It would appear you haven't
long to wait before you know.

3110
02:52:34,575 --> 02:52:37,144
It's banging on the gates, all right.

3111
02:52:37,212 --> 02:52:39,046
It must be
quite difficult,

3112
02:52:39,113 --> 02:52:41,048
Widowed
and bearing a child.

3113
02:52:41,115 --> 02:52:43,918
I would've preferred it
otherwise.

3114
02:52:43,985 --> 02:52:45,920
I would've
been by sooner,

3115
02:52:45,987 --> 02:52:47,922
But I'm just back
from dublin.

3116
02:52:47,989 --> 02:52:49,423
It's a beautiful city.

3117
02:52:49,491 --> 02:52:50,925
You must see it.

3118
02:52:50,992 --> 02:52:53,427
I have every intention
of seeing it.

3119
02:52:53,495 --> 02:52:56,430
Perhaps I can be
your guide and escort.

3120
02:52:56,498 --> 02:52:58,933
You might care to meet
some fashionable people,

3121
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,435
I dare say,
even the viceroy.

3122
02:53:01,503 --> 02:53:02,937
Does it sound appealing?

3123
02:53:03,004 --> 02:53:04,972
I have to admit
it does.

3124
02:53:05,039 --> 02:53:06,957
I could benefit
from some relief

3125
02:53:07,024 --> 02:53:10,961
From all the muck I've been
slogging through of late.

3126
02:53:11,028 --> 02:53:14,465
But there's somebody else
I've got to meet first, though.

3127
02:53:14,532 --> 02:53:15,633
Of course.

3128
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:17,200
In due time.

3129
02:53:19,036 --> 02:53:21,538
In due time,
I just might.

3130
02:53:29,180 --> 02:53:32,465
I'll take
your horse, father.

3131
02:53:43,244 --> 02:53:46,013
Throw another log
on the fire.

3132
02:53:46,081 --> 02:53:50,017
Colum, what are you doing
out on a night like this?

3133
02:53:50,085 --> 02:53:52,519
I was halfway here
when the storm broke.

3134
02:53:52,587 --> 02:53:55,055
It was easier
to keep coming.

3135
02:53:55,122 --> 02:53:58,959
Who but a priest would
venture out on allhallows eve?

3136
02:53:59,026 --> 02:54:00,427
You're in time
for supper.

3137
02:54:00,495 --> 02:54:02,896
I was hoping
I might be.

3138
02:54:02,963 --> 02:54:05,907
This came in the adamstown
post for you today.

3139
02:54:05,942 --> 02:54:08,852
I'm expecting something
from my lawyer in atlanta.

3140
02:54:08,970 --> 02:54:11,338
This isn't it,
though.

3141
02:54:11,405 --> 02:54:13,841
It's from an aunt
in charleston.

3142
02:54:13,908 --> 02:54:16,076
Would you lay another place for colum?

3143
02:54:16,144 --> 02:54:19,029
I'll just go make myself more presentable.

3144
02:54:43,555 --> 02:54:44,488
Oh, god.

3145
02:54:46,073 --> 02:54:47,474
The baby.

3146
02:54:54,482 --> 02:54:55,982
Ohh!

3147
02:55:08,596 --> 02:55:10,514
Mrs. Fitzpatrick!

3148
02:55:14,018 --> 02:55:15,519
Mrs. Fitz!

3149
02:55:22,026 --> 02:55:23,193
It's coming!

3150
02:55:24,579 --> 02:55:26,096
It's coming!

3151
02:55:29,451 --> 02:55:30,884
I'll get the doctor.

3152
02:55:30,952 --> 02:55:33,987
He's too far,
and there isn't the time.

3153
02:55:34,055 --> 02:55:35,823
Something's not natural.
There's blood.

3154
02:55:35,890 --> 02:55:38,909
I can't vouch for myself
to do it, colum.

3155
02:55:38,976 --> 02:55:40,411
I'll fetch someone
who will.

3156
02:55:40,478 --> 02:55:42,913
Nobody will venture out
on allhallows eve.

3157
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:46,617
Perhaps I'll get someone to
come under special protection.

3158
02:56:00,498 --> 02:56:02,499
Go on, now!

3159
02:56:02,567 --> 02:56:03,550
Hyah!

3160
02:56:37,451 --> 02:56:38,952
Whoa!

3161
02:57:05,113 --> 02:57:06,880
Aah! Aah!

3162
02:57:13,087 --> 02:57:14,088
No!

3163
02:57:18,926 --> 02:57:20,243
Aah!

3164
02:57:21,646 --> 02:57:23,764
It'll be all right,
darlin', shush.

3165
02:57:23,832 --> 02:57:25,031
Shush, darlin'.

3166
02:57:25,099 --> 02:57:26,533
No!

3167
02:57:26,601 --> 02:57:29,069
Shush, shush, shush.

3168
02:57:48,556 --> 02:57:49,573
No!

3169
02:57:49,641 --> 02:57:51,941
It'll be all right.

3170
02:57:54,696 --> 02:58:01,684
Aah!

3171
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:46,729
Aah!

3172
02:58:53,555 --> 02:58:58,291
Aah!
