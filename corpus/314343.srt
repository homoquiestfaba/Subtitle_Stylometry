1
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,004
- What?
- Turn down the music.

2
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,511
- Whatever. Yeah.
- Hey.

3
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,410
Don't. Look<i>...</i>

4
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,676
- Coz.
- Yeah, what's up, coz.

5
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,319
Sorry, it's just... Entertaining.

6
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,512
I missed you.
How'd you know it was me?

7
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,520
I knew it was you.
This piece-of-shit car.

8
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,591
Hey, hey, hey.
This is not a piece of shit.

9
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,318
You should be happy
I have this car.

10
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,690
It means I'm taking care of myself.

11
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,493
- Welcome to the Hamptons, coz.
- Yeah, yeah. It's nice.

12
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,930
It's so nice.

13
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,799
First, I want you to know that
this is just a little party...

14
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,872
...so just be cool, okay?

15
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,137
What is this, another one of these
money, benefit functions?

16
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,043
What else are you gonna add
to the house, another wing?

17
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,650
Baby, look who's here.

18
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:50,050
Look what my kitty-cat dragged in.
Hey, baby boy, hey.

19
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,383
- Good.
- It's been a while.

20
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,548
- Here, that's for you.
- Thank you.

21
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,854
Everyone, this is Tracy Hutchison.
This is Sky's cousin from New York.

22
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,691
Tre, this is Emily,
Nancy and Charles.

23
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,662
- How you doing?
- Welcome to the Hamptons, Tre.

24
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,095
"Tracy," please.

25
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,667
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

26
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,861
So, what brings you
from New York, Tracy?

27
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,405
- A little summertime retreat?
- No, I'm...

28
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,168
Tre works for
one of my father's magazines.

29
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,639
Yeah. I'm writing an article
for <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine...

30
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,078
...about hip-hop in the Hamptons.

31
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,744
And Sky here, she's gonna let me
crash at her place while I cover it.

32
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,082
Is there really
that much hip-hop here?

33
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,920
Ever heard of Summer G?
Rap mogul, self-made millionaire?

34
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,756
Dropped out of college,
started his own label.

35
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,988
Yadda yadda yadda.

36
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,463
Well, he just bought a place here
about a month ago.

37
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,161
Yeah, I'm waiting to be overwhelmed
with bouncing cars and do-rags.

38
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,238
Baby, that's West Coast.

39
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,738
Wait, he just bought
the old Vandercleef place...

40
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,240
...about a mile down the road.

41
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,502
Oh, really?

42
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,509
That close to Sky?

43
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,307
- Did you know that?
- No, no.

44
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,144
I don't really follow the hip-hop world
much anymore.

45
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,219
Well, he must never leave his house.
I've never seen him in town.

46
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,186
I heard that all of his bodyguards
are ex-convicts.

47
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:03,386
- I heard that he used to be in a gang.
- No, I don't think that's quite true.

48
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,532
Well, he's having his
Memorial Day party today.

49
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,102
So when I meet him, I'll see
if there's any truth to the rumors.

50
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,728
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I mean? All right?

51
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,307
Sky, why don't you and Chip
come hang out with me.

52
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,913
- Thank you, no.
- Come on, baby. I think it'll be fun.

53
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,980
Go out, party.
Do something, you know?

54
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,743
Come on there,
Mr. Hightower, loosen up.

55
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,648
Tre, give me a hand inside.
Excuse us a second, baby.

56
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,812
- Can you bring everybody up?
- Absolutely.

57
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,857
- Come on, big boy.
- Oh, I'm in trouble.

58
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,797
- Isn't he great? I love this.
- Oh, yes.

59
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,661
No, I don't even know these people.
No, they're from the zoning board.

60
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,830
I have to schmooze
to let them allow me...

61
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,499
...to build a tennis court
in my own backyard.

62
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,712
- The struggle continues.
- This is what I'm saying.

63
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,508
No, sounds rough. Sounds rough.

64
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:00,209
Why I didn't become a struggling
Bohemian like you, I'll never know.

65
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,946
- It pays less money.
- Oh, that's right. That's right.

66
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,984
No, no.

67
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,560
Tracy, we're boys, right?
You know what I mean. You're my boy.

68
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,526
- Always have been.
- Yeah, we boys.

69
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,461
I want you to do me a favor.
Tomorrow, I'm not going to work.

70
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,398
I'm gonna ride across town
to see an old friend of mine.

71
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,128
- Who?
- She's just an old friend.

72
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,139
But she has a single younger sister,
and I told her I'd bring you along...

73
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,300
...and you could keep
her sister busy for us.

74
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,675
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
So how's everything with my cousin?

75
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,148
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, easy man.

76
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,449
No, first and foremost,
she's my wife, all right?

77
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,855
She is a friend, this woman.
Her sister's a pain in the ass.

78
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,491
Just come along and show everybody
that I actually do know ethnic people.

79
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,692
Ethnic people, huh?

80
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,397
No.

81
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,540
No, I can't do that.

82
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,472
All right. All right.

83
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,947
All right, I understand.

84
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,354
Hey, Tre...

85
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,820
...how's things at my father's
magazine for you?

86
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,589
Okey-dokey, I guess.

87
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,694
Okey-dokey?
What the fuck is that?

88
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,599
Yeah, all right, look.

89
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,293
Straight up. I mean, we boys.

90
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,268
Are you sleeping
with this girl, or what?

91
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,935
What did I say?

92
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,081
Okay, look. Now, I'm not hanging out
with you cats all day, okay?

93
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,310
- I got a lot of work to do, as you know...
- That's all I'm asking.

94
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,786
See, we're boys, Tracy.

95
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,790
So, what about tonight?
You going to that party?

96
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,793
Unless you and your pops
have an itinerary I need to follow.

97
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,090
- Y'all wanted to go?
- No.

98
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,497
As a matter of fact, go ahead and take
Sky with you if she wants to go.

99
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,796
You just keep an eye on her.

100
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,773
With all these roughnecks around.

101
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,201
Rapper types.

102
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,877
Do that for me?

103
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,642
You are my boy, Tracy Hutchison.

104
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,016
You're my boy.

105
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,155
- Tre Hutchison, <i>Flow</i> magazine.
- Tre, Tre.

106
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,019
It should say, "Hutchison."
I'm on the list. Thank you.

107
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,318
- Hold on.
- My plus one.

108
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,256
- I'm with him.
- Thank you.

109
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,830
No, no, I said three cases
of Cristal.

110
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,966
Tre? Tre Hutchison?

111
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,074
Hey, Adam Gordon.
Hey, how are you, man?

112
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,904
- So glad you guys made it out.
- Yes. This is my cousin, Sky.

113
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,775
Hi, great to meet you.
Listen, help yourself to a drink.

114
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,974
I'm gonna go find Summer, all right?
I love you. Thank you.

115
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,587
- Not right now.
- Adam, listen...

116
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,555
Daizy, I gotta find Summer.
You seen him?

117
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,321
Adam. I have an idea.
I wanna sing tonight.

118
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,090
We got a house full of people.
It's a private audience.

119
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,790
- No press, no photographers.
- Daizy, Daizy.

120
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,163
If Summer says you're not ready,
you're not ready.

121
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,464
- Let me go find Summer now?
- No, you know what?

122
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,471
You tell Summer
fuck rapping then, okay?

123
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,406
- Lf he can't cut me a break...
- You'll walk to another label.

124
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,138
- That's right.
- Daizy, there are other artists here.

125
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,976
Why do you deserve
the special treatment?

126
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,320
Do you really have to ask that?

127
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,513
Summer?

128
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,159
Hey, Summer, are you in there?

129
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,719
Yo, Summer, you there?

130
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,212
Summer?

131
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,982
That writer from <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine
is downstairs.

132
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,851
My advice? Parties are good
for business, mood swings are bad.

133
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,687
- Tre?
- Hello. Hey.

134
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,918
- How's it going?
- Yes.

135
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,689
- Summer, very nice to meet you.
- From <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine.

136
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,661
Yes. Thank you
for doing the interview.

137
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,698
Appreciate it.
Can't wait to give the fans a new...

138
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,857
- Tre, is it?
- Yes.

139
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,528
Right. Yes, interview B. Mo.
Where's B. Mo at?

140
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,005
Yo, B. Mo!
B. Mo! B. Mo!

141
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,700
- I look forward to...
- Yeah, I know.

142
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,209
But I need something to drink.

143
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,176
- What's up, dog?
- B. Mo, this is Tre...

144
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,679
...from <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine.

145
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,750
- He wants an interview, dog.
- Word?

146
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,146
All right. Okay.

147
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,966
You sing that song, "Let Me Lick
Your Toes and Make You Brunch?"

148
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,867
That song's the shit.

149
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,797
You don't understand.
It's so romantic.

150
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,909
Well, it came out a while ago.
You know, it's no big deal.

151
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,672
Makes me feel like a one-hit wonder
sometimes, know what I'm saying?

152
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,749
Well, ladies, it was really nice talking.
If you don't mind, excuse us.

153
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,977
- All right.
- Bye.

154
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,455
What's wrong?

155
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,854
- I don't like when you do that.
- What?

156
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,498
Refer to yourself as a one-hit wonder.

157
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,260
Look around you.
I haven't had a hit in two years.

158
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,666
All these people, they all got
hit songs out right now. I'm just not...

159
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,069
But you're not.
I wouldn't be with a one-hit wonder.

160
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,005
You're one of the largest-selling artists
on Summer's label...

161
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,668
...and I want you to act like it.

162
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,679
I'm just staying grounded, baby,
you know?

163
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,821
Mr. Summer?

164
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,325
Hi, Gene Underhill.

165
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,932
Hamptons Homeowners Association,
representing your neighbors.

166
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:58,297
We've been trying to contact you
about the noise level at your parties.

167
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,205
Which neighbor would that be?
Because I think they're all here.

168
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,108
Well, that's not really the point, sir.

169
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,805
Your parties are a constant source
of nuisance for your neighbors.

170
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,143
Now if you're unable
to contain them...

171
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,982
...the homeowners association will
have to respectfully impose a curfew.

172
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,284
Now, if you're unable to comply by<i>...</i>

173
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,110
I'm sorry?

174
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,546
- What are you saying?
- You require a permit, sir.

175
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,176
A party of this stature
requires permits.

176
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,820
- Adam, do we have permits?
- Yes, we have the permit.

177
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,953
Permit. Mr. Underhill,
it was a pleasure. Thank you.

178
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,067
Well, there's still the matter
of the noise and the nuisance.

179
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,216
Summer, how are you doing?

180
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:27,291
Look, I know it's mad hectic right now
with this great party and everything...

181
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,757
...but I was wondering, you know<i>...</i>

182
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,524
I'd like to introduce you to somebody.
My cousin, Sky.

183
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,452
Summer.

184
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,352
Sky.

185
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,190
It's been a long time.
How you doing?

186
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,298
- Been well.
- I'm sorry, wait a minute.

187
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,837
- Y'all two know each other?
- Yeah, we do.

188
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,066
- We went to college together.
- College?

189
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,011
Why didn't you tell me
anything, Sky?

190
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,946
I didn't think he'd remember.
It's been a long time.

191
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,953
Wait a minute. You went
to the Fashion Institute of Technology.

192
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,385
You went to
the Fashion Institute of Technology?

193
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,221
- Yeah, I did.
- What for?

194
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,961
Fashion.

195
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,964
Fashion, okay.
I just got a little startled. I'm sorry.

196
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,603
Did y'all two graduate?

197
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,070
Actually,
Summer never graduated...

198
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,108
...because he was so busy starting up
Royal G records in his dorm room.

199
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,006
And Sky never attended
graduation...

200
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,046
...because she ran off
with some cat to get married.

201
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,285
Okay.

202
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,545
Seems we know a lot
about each other, don't we?

203
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,522
- Not really.
- Not really.

204
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,022
You know, it was really nice of...

205
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,223
Okay. Well, nice party.
Thank you for inviting us.

206
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,529
I'm gonna go and get a drink.

207
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,339
- Hey.
- Hey.

208
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,635
- How you doing?
- Okay. I'm okay.

209
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,801
- You like?
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

210
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,574
- You spent your money well, I guess.
- Take a ride.

211
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,619
Here, we got some boats.

212
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,093
A nice little bar outside.

213
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,357
You got the Hamptons, baby.
You must love this.

214
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,057
- It's all right.
- It's all right?

215
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,204
- Little different from Manhattan?
- Yes.

216
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,635
So, what do you think here, Mr. G?

217
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,005
Does hip-hop have heart?

218
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,345
Let's talk about your cousin.

219
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,044
Why don't you tell me
about my cousin.

220
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,313
I mean, I'm not new, brother.
I saw you flinch.

221
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,825
Yeah, well<i>...</i>

222
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,154
Well, we were together
a couple of years back in school.

223
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,527
- That's it.
- Two years? What happened?

224
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,759
Maybe you should ask your cousin.

225
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,570
But it's not dead yet?

226
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,107
I mean, chemistry's still there, right?

227
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,710
No, it's dead.

228
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,402
I mean, for me, it's dead.

229
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,911
Yeah, but she left kind of abruptly,
you know.

230
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,622
Yo, dog, check this out.
This is why I brought you out here.

231
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,815
I haven't seen Sky in years.
I would love to catch up, you know.

232
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,756
I was wondering if you can arrange,
like, a rendezvous...

233
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,421
...so we can talk.

234
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,892
Bartender, can I get
a Jack and Coke, please?

235
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,332
Look, you know she's married.
Right? I mean<i>...</i>

236
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,870
- I know she's married.
- Married. So I can't do that.

237
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,871
I just don't feel comfortable. I can't.

238
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,444
Thank you.

239
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,977
You're serious?

240
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,778
Yeah, it's getting late.

241
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,385
You got this? Thanks.

242
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,894
What's wrong, baby?

243
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,395
I don't know.

244
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,205
I'm not happy.

245
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,167
Why, what's wrong?

246
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,804
This is Summer G's house.

247
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,909
I want my own house.

248
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,411
It's only for the summer.

249
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,714
After next year,
I'll drop my album.

250
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,350
We'll marry.

251
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,830
I'll buy you a house.

252
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,896
House of your dreams.

253
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,448
Hey.

254
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,858
Hey.

255
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,156
What happened to you?

256
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:42,166
How was the rest of the party?
Anybody bust a cap on a sucker?

257
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,167
Cap on a sucker.

258
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,738
- What do you know about that?
- I know a lot about a lot of things.

259
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,040
Don't try to start that perfect-life
bullshit here. Have a seat.

260
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,872
Okay.

261
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,212
What was up with you
and Summer G?

262
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,780
You loved him?

263
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,081
Cheated on you?

264
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:07,157
- Put his hands on you?
- No, nothing like that.

265
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,253
Okay, drugs?

266
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,797
He did drugs. Drugs.

267
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,728
He sold a little weed in college...

268
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,701
...but just to get by, you know.
Nothing big.

269
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,632
Wait a minute,
you smoked weed?

270
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,302
I'd smoke weed now if I had some,
but Chip thinks it's unladylike, so<i>...</i>

271
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,513
Well, listen, anyway.

272
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,815
Well, what was it? Come on.
What was it?

273
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,011
Come on. Come on, coz.
Talk to me.

274
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,216
- I mean, I see you in pain.
- I don't wanna talk about it, Tre.

275
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,354
Chip knows about you
and Summer?

276
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,054
Chip knows that 10 years ago...

277
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,396
...he stole me away from a guy named
Greg at college. They never met.

278
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,171
Wait a minute.

279
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,243
You mean, 10 years ago...

280
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,708
...you cheat on a struggling artist for
a businessman who buys you gifts?

281
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,817
You know what, Tre?
Fuck you. Fuck you!

282
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,545
- You don't know what happened!
- Okay, okay, Sky.

283
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,951
Hey, Sky, come on.

284
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,252
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,054
All right? Look, I'm your cousin,
and I love you.

286
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,754
I mean, I got your back,
no matter what.

287
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,393
I just want you to be happy. You.

288
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,867
Well, I was there, Tre,
and I know what happened, okay?

289
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,266
So it's over.

290
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,271
God, look at you.

291
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,444
It isn't over, is it?

292
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,482
I'm going to bed.

293
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,560
Bill, you cut me, baby.

294
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,560
I had that. Do you see?
I had that there.

295
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,997
I need you to watch what you're doing.
I mean, damn, Bill. Get with it now.

296
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,137
Shit.

297
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,033
Hey, Ladara, girl, I gotta tell you.

298
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,333
This shit, this is the life.

299
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,171
I mean, girl, you got a house
in the Hamptons, on the water.

300
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,041
And you got this shit
for the whole summer.

301
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:14,015
How did a Brooklyn heifer such as
yourself swing something like that?

302
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,485
Yeah, now. Anything's possible
when you got the hookup.

303
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,715
- Get that.
- Oh, is that right?

304
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,854
That's all.

305
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,157
Something on the tables, son.
Something on the tables, all right.

306
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,026
Hey, Shelly.
Shelly, I don't want no steaks.

307
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,796
Give me some corn
with lots of butter and lots of pepper.

308
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,463
And some more E&J.
Some of that Easy Jesus.

309
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,740
Get all that?

310
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,243
Oh, goodness.

311
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,974
So how are you doing, Tre?
You having a good time?

312
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,777
Oh, it's "Tracy."

313
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,716
And, yes, I'm having a good time.
I'm having a good time.

314
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,356
Just feel kind of silly.

315
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,823
I came here to check on my man,
and it just... I don't know. I feel stupid.

316
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,395
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no. He needs to be checked on.

317
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,532
His trifling ass.

318
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,697
- So I hear you're a photographer.
- No, I'm a writer.

319
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,806
I write for <i>TrueFlow</i> magazine.

320
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,169
- What? For real?
- Yeah.

321
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,605
Shit, that's my shit.

322
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,076
I got a subscription, I got covers
all along my station at work.

323
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,840
I mean, yo<i>...</i>

324
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,507
So, what, you been meeting
a lot of celebs and shit?

325
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,212
Yeah, yeah. Right now, I'm doing
an article on Summer G.

326
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,947
No.

327
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,616
- Hey, Shelly.
- What?

328
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,091
Bring Chip his steak.
We in the middle of a game now.

329
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,924
I ain't bringing him shit.

330
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,032
He ain't my man.

331
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,358
Ain't yours neither.

332
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,696
Hey, Tre.

333
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,771
Hey, Tre, I heard Summer G is
second cousin to the devil.

334
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,908
And that's how he got
so successful.

335
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,302
Baby, can you please
not say stuff like that?

336
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,711
I mean, people gonna think
you're retarded and shit.

337
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,818
I'm gonna have to get back to you
on that one there, Bill.

338
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,783
I'd like some of that steak, honey.

339
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,049
I need something to soak up
some of this E&J in my system.

340
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,491
I'm gonna have diarrhea
like a motherfucker.

341
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,459
Jesus come easy in a bottle.

342
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,333
Jesus come quickly.

343
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,095
- That's Summer G.
- That's Summer G?

344
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,469
That's Summer G's new joint on.
That's Summer G's new joint, y'all.

345
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,167
That's my song.
You need to turn that shit up, baby.

346
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:25,180
- You, come over here and dance.
- Get up and dance with me a little.

347
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,882
Oh, so you can't
dance with me, huh?

348
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,856
Everywhere I look
they're talking about Summer G.

349
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,626
Now I gotta hear this garbage
on the radio? I don't wanna dance.

350
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,766
You can fuck me,
but you don't wanna dance with me?

351
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,997
And I can rent you a house
in the Hamptons too.

352
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,642
Sit down and relax.
Come on.

353
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,207
- Lf I was your wife...
- Don't talk about my wife.

354
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,315
You'd wanna dance with her.
So just pretend I'm Little Miss Sky.

355
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,442
Because I know you're thinking
about me when you're fucking her.

356
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,291
- Chip!
- Don't put your fucking hands on me.

357
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,518
Don't ever put your hands
on my sister again...

358
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,060
...you hear me,
you bitch-ass fucking faggot?

359
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,425
Just stay out of this, Shelly.

360
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,600
Get your ass on the other side
of town, motherfucker.

361
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,361
Put your hands on my sister again...

362
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,734
...I will stab you in the dick
with a plastic spoon, you hear me?

363
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,909
I don't give a fuck
what house you own.

364
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,670
Nigga, I'll burn this bitch up
with your ass up in it.

365
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,644
I'm sure it's the E&J.
E&J makes a nigga short with me.

366
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,249
Your wife might like it
when you smack her around...

367
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,885
...but we from Brooklyn, bitch.

368
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,218
- Ladara!
- Come on.

369
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,688
- Come on.
- Ladara!

370
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,806
Can't believe she's gonna
fuck that nigga...

371
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,669
...with blood coming out
of her mouth.

372
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,237
Damn.

373
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,975
- Look, I gotta go.
- Where you gotta go?

374
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,208
- I got a son at home, waiting.
- I know, I know.

375
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,445
- I'm sorry about this whole Chip thing.
- It's not your fault, all right? I'm out.

376
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,284
I can make it up. Summer's having
a party with his children.

377
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:17,360
Bring your son.
I'll try to make it happen. I'm sorry.

378
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,930
I'll do it.

379
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,737
So here's the deal, Tre.

380
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,575
From this point on,
every interview I give, I give to you.

381
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,108
It's yours, exclusive.

382
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,802
If you can make this happen.

383
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,879
Look, I'm not doing this
for any interview.

384
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,881
I'm doing this because I want to.

385
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,279
But deal.

386
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,819
Just promise me this isn't any,
you know, revenge-stalker...

387
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,653
...l- can't-live-without-my-baby
type of thing, you know.

388
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,159
No, look...

389
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,957
...the thing is, Sky and I
lived together for two years.

390
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,862
Okay, I thought I was gonna marry
the girl.

391
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,702
But I find out
she was playing on me with<i>...</i>

392
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,702
Anyway<i>...</i>

393
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,100
I kind of just lost it.
You know, I called her.

394
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,972
She wasn't there,
so I left her a message.

395
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,513
She never returned that message,
so I went over there.

396
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,546
She moved.

397
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,778
Without giving me a reason.

398
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,389
Without saying goodbye. Nothing.

399
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,951
Man, I just...
I just had to know why, man.

400
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,290
I just have to know the truth.

401
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,293
Yeah.

402
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,458
So you're telling me that
after 10 years...

403
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:36,005
...this truth, it still matters?

404
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,010
- I mean<i>...</i>
- Yes, it still matters.

405
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,579
- Leave now?
- Craig, I'm not leaving.

406
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:47,411
I'm just going to Dierdra's
for a few days.

407
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,486
I just need a little time
to breathe.

408
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,955
All right. It's cool.

409
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,586
Baby, you mind if B. Mo
and Daizy come with us?

410
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,695
Just tag along for the ride?

411
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,196
Fine. You know, Craig, here I am,
once again putting my needs second...

412
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,301
...so that I can babysit for you.

413
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,600
- But fine.
- Nicole, please.

414
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,541
B. Mo and Daizy.

415
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,582
Why are there two coffee cups
in the truck?

416
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,149
- What?
- You heard me.

417
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,717
Why are there two coffee cups?

418
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,912
- Who did you have in here?
- Nobody. What are you talking about?

419
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,216
I got a cup of coffee
before I went to the gym...

420
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,987
...and I got a cup when I came out.
What is wrong with you?

421
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,457
Yo, yo, yo, let's go.
Come on now.

422
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,064
I need me a fish sandwich.

423
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,394
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

424
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,164
Can you believe the last three delis
that we've been to don't sell Newports.

425
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,365
What kind of damn-ass place
don't sell fucking Newports?

426
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,204
- It's the number-one brand and shit.
- Fucked-up bullshit.

427
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,606
But I told you.

428
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,113
I told you, we jumped right
in the fucking TV set.

429
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,148
Look around.

430
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,313
Where the colored folks at?
This is fucking Mayberry right here.

431
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:05,325
Yo. Yo, yo, Craig, stop the car, nigga.
Black people! Black people!

432
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,767
Hey, yo, son.

433
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,263
- Hey, yo.
- Hey, yo, dog.

434
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,466
Yo.

435
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,310
Hey, yo, dog. Do a brother a favor.
Where I can scoop some Ides?

436
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,281
- I'm sorry?
- Son, I need a 40 of the Saint.

437
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,647
But a deuce will do.

438
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,218
I'm sorry, I don't have any money.

439
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,491
- What the fuck are you talking...?
- No, no, no, bro.

440
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,653
Malt liquor, B. Booze?

441
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,265
- That's what we talking about.
- And a McDonald's, okay?

442
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,829
Malt liquor?
Man, this ain't Harlem.

443
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,199
Harlem?

444
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,171
Wait a minute, honey!
Listen, we're from Brooklyn, okay?

445
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,037
East New York, baby. Get it right.

446
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,009
And I'm straight out of Bed-Stuy,
and I'm a peaceful brother...

447
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,274
...but I will bust a cap in your fake
Bryant Gumbel-wannabe ass...

448
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,180
...on some bullshit like that!

449
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,948
- You're B. Mo Smoov, right?
- Word.

450
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,287
- And you're Daizy Duke?
- Yeah.

451
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,024
And you're Craig Lewis?

452
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,688
Holy shit. Give me five dollars.
She knows me.

453
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,135
- Five dollars.
- What?

454
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,705
We up in the Hamptons.

455
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,205
There's a McDonald's and
a 7-Eleven off Route 27.

456
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,439
- You'll find all you want there.
- You got that?

457
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,379
- All right.
- Good looking out, mama.

458
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,782
- Okay?
- White folk in the Hamptons?

459
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,047
They're representing!

460
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,591
We blowing the fuck up!

461
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,159
- Where Brooklyn at?
- In the house!

462
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,821
Where Brooklyn at? In the house!
Where Brooklyn at?

463
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,494
We're blowing the fuck up!

464
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,670
Sky.

465
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,847
Hey, Sky?

466
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,190
Can we turn this down a little bit?
I thought you didn't like it.

467
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,699
It's rap.

468
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,464
Oh, buddy, you tell me.
How was work?

469
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,704
Sarcasm aside, he loved it.

470
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,036
Great.

471
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,009
Good thing there's a Merrill Lynch
branch near the Hamptons, huh?

472
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,273
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,077
Babe...

474
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,011
<i>...</i>we need to talk.
- What about, baby?

475
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,686
Babe, I need you
to be honest with me...

476
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,261
...or I'm gonna go crazy.

477
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,802
Just tell me.

478
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,340
- Tell you what?
- Just fucking tell me, Chip.

479
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,310
Okay, could you not use profanity.

480
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,279
You are my wife.
You are too beautiful for that.

481
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,511
My wife doesn't use profanity, okay?

482
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,787
Just fucking tell me
or let me go?

483
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,024
I don't know what you're asking me,
I really don't...

484
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,895
...but we're okay, you and me.

485
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,094
Right?

486
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:38,206
We're okay.
You are... Look at me.

487
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,742
You are my everything.

488
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,438
I love you.

489
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,513
I've always loved you.

490
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,958
Summer.

491
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,965
Summer.

492
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,834
Summer.

493
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,305
Summer.

494
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,953
- Hey, Daizy, what's up.
- Hey.

495
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,716
Summer?

496
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,016
Morning.

497
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,325
What's up?

498
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,067
Tracy, about yesterday<i>...</i>

499
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:22,068
Yeah, I know it looked bad.

500
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,977
Your cousin and I, we have problems.
And everybody's got problems.

501
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,641
But they're our problems.

502
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,619
Just like I wouldn't understand
problems...

503
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,019
...you might have
in my father's magazine...

504
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,387
...I wouldn't expect you to
understand problems...

505
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,189
...I might have in
my marriage with Sky.

506
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,368
Are we on the same page?

507
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,136
Okey-dokey.

508
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,173
Okey-dokey.

509
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,771
Okey-dokey.

510
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,921
I'm off to the office, Tracy.
See you this afternoon.

511
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,752
See you.

512
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,546
Dog, I'm saying, we were just
chilling at the red light.

513
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,152
- Minding our own business.
- What?

514
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,185
And the white chick gave
us the shout out.

515
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,954
- The white chick.
- Okay.

516
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,388
- Dog, it blew my mind, kid.
- We blowing up, Summer.

517
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,360
We are blowing up.
And everybody can see that.

518
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,132
Yeah, yeah, me too.

519
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,291
So, what do you guys want?

520
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,037
I wanna take it to the next level.

521
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,801
I wanna start producing
my own beats.

522
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:04,277
Right. And, Summer, baby,
I need to stop rapping...

523
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,178
...because you know I can sing.

524
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,178
Produce. Sing.

525
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,182
All this because some
white chick recognized you.

526
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,793
Summer, our audience is expanding.
We need to too.

527
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,795
B. Mo, you need to show me
some responsibility.

528
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,265
And, Daizy, it's getting there,
but your voice is not there yet.

529
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,568
Summer, no disrespect, dog...

530
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,235
...but that's the bullshit.

531
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,157
Who the hell is that?

532
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,893
With no ring on her finger.

533
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,464
<i>Vogue.</i>

534
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,236
- Excuse me?
<i>- Vogue.</i>

535
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,707
You in this week's <i>Vogue.</i>

536
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,971
Oh, and I suppose you read <i>Vogue</i>?

537
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:14,948
Hey, hey, I'm a well-rounded,
educated, sophisticated brother.

538
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,587
I read lots of things.

539
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,622
Yeah, all right.

540
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,625
- I was in this week's <i>Vogue.</i>
- That's what I'm saying.

541
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:28,595
I knew that. And I suppose
you know who I am?

542
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,096
No.

543
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,629
You joking, right?
I'm B. Mo Smoov.

544
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,864
Straight out of Bed-Stuy.

545
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,313
You know, I think I heard you
on the radio this week.

546
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,114
Talk to me.

547
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,249
You looked a lot taller on the radio.

548
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,398
Pretty young lady has jokes.

549
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,265
Can't believe you're funny
and fine.

550
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,372
I'm sorry, can I offer you
something to drink, Ms. Mommy?

551
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,174
You know what?

552
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,346
My name is Shelly, okay?

553
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,574
And I don't drink.

554
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,945
Now, why don't you take a walk
around the party...

555
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,145
...see if you can find another mommy
worth bothering.

556
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,651
And if you can't,
you come back here to me.

557
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,418
Respectfully.

558
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,426
Oh, and by the way, player...

559
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,663
<i>... Vogue</i> is a monthly publication,
not a weekly.

560
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,868
I knew that.

561
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,714
Fine motherfucker.

562
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,942
I know what I got.
Five minutes. I know.

563
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,644
- Can you open the door?
- No, you know how to open a door.

564
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,017
Come on. Let's go.

565
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,617
Tracy and Sky, what a surprise.

566
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,954
Five minutes. Come on.

567
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,996
- Tracy.
- Adam, how we doing there?

568
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,530
- Sky.
- Hey, Adam.

569
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,134
Hey, what's up, Tre. Sky.

570
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,202
- How you doing?
- All right.

571
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,535
- All right.
- Listen, why don't we go inside.

572
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,042
I got Daizy waiting for you to talk to.

573
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,408
- Daizy Duke, right now?
- We hooked that up for you.

574
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,950
Come on, let's go there.

575
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:36,817
Hey.

576
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,725
- Hello.
- Sky.

577
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,029
- How you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

578
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:47,329
- Doing well.
- So, what's going on here?

579
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,535
Brought some kids out
from my old neighborhood...

580
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,612
...invited some kids from here,
threw a little party.

581
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,874
Kind of a cultural-awareness
kind of thing.

582
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,744
- Cute.
- Yeah.

583
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,411
Okay, well, I gotta go.
So I'll see you later.

584
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,788
Let's go for a walk.

585
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,460
Okay.

586
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,127
<i>Hey, it's Nicole.</i>
<i>You hit me on my cell phone.</i>

587
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,464
<i>So leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll hit you back.</i>

588
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,368
What's up, Nicole? It's me, Craig.

589
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:28,478
Just wanted to invite you to a little
barbeque over at Summer's house.

590
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,539
Where you been at?
I called you at Dierdra's...

591
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,912
...cell phone, voicemail.

592
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,120
Call me when you
get a chance, all right?

593
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,723
Peace. I love you.

594
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,857
I have a question for you.

595
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,861
Really? Well<i>...</i>

596
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,798
It ought to be good, you've had
a lot of time to think about it.

597
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,903
Why'd you leave?

598
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,003
Is that what this is all about?
Because if it is, I'm out.

599
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,109
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, well, hold on, just<i>...</i>

600
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,677
- Why'd you leave?
- Why were you so angry all the time?

601
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,040
Angry? I wasn't angry.

602
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,681
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

603
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,079
Is that why you left,
you thought I was angry?

604
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,447
This is ridiculous.
Why am I even here? I'm going.

605
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,454
No, no, Sky,
just answer this question...

606
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,421
...and I promise
I will leave you alone.

607
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,926
You can do what you do,
I'll do what I do.

608
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,627
Why did you leave me for Chip?

609
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,795
Can we go discuss this somewhere
privately if we're gonna talk?

610
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,808
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Come on, right this way.

611
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,344
- What's up, Daizy?
- Nothing.

612
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,195
Private enough?

613
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,896
Yes. Thank you.

614
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,536
Good.

615
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,843
From the first moment
Chip saw me...

616
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,313
...he let me know
he'd do anything for me.

617
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,110
It felt so good, because I'd
come home to you at night...

618
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,118
...and you were so angry
about your day...

619
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,052
...that you couldn't even
listen to me.

620
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,184
And here he was taking me
to plays and picnics.

621
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,887
And he listened to me when
I needed to cry about you.

622
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,564
Did he give you money?

623
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:36,433
Yeah. No, no.

624
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,632
He helped me.

625
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,242
And I didn't take it at first.

626
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,742
But here was this man...

627
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,506
...I didn't know him,
I didn't live with him...

628
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,979
...I didn't even love him...

629
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,313
...and here he was, offering me
his friendship and his support...

630
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,818
...because I had no one.

631
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,919
Do you know how
that made me feel?

632
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,889
Sky, you were lying to me.

633
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,998
You're sitting here telling
me in one ear...

634
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,225
...that you're going out
with your girlfriends.

635
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,700
In the other, my boys are telling me
that you're out with Chip.

636
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,395
Do you know
how that made me feel?

637
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,041
Okay, what? So you didn't
step up because I was lying...

638
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,575
...and I was lying because
you didn't step up. So what?

639
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,440
- So what?
- The point is...

640
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,808
...I was unhappy
when I was with you, Summer.

641
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,416
And you didn't do anything
to make me feel better.

642
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:24,816
I didn't do anything?
Everything I did was for you, Sky.

643
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,081
Trying to make you happy.
You know, whatever.

644
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:31,250
Look, just tell me.
Is that what it was about?

645
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,396
Him buying you things,
taking you places?

646
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,588
Just stop it, okay?

647
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,824
Is that what you think?
It was about the money?

648
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,798
That's never been important.
That's always been your own issue.

649
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,996
Okay, I left you because
I stopped believing in you.

650
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,101
There.

651
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,617
Is that what you needed to hear?

652
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,889
I'm just not believing it.

653
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,953
You know, I never wanted
to be apart from you.

654
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,452
Listen, this world I built...

655
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,858
...it was for you.

656
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,161
So I can prove to you that...

657
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,534
...you know, I could be that man,
that I am that man...

658
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,971
...that you wanted me to be.

659
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:59,372
I never gave up hope that one day
that we'll be together.

660
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,279
Hey.

661
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,215
I ain't never gonna stop
believing in you.

662
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,790
I ain't never gonna stop.

663
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,159
No matter what you think,
Summer...

664
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,700
...you have to know that
I loved you so much.

665
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,163
You need to know that.

666
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,206
I loved you too, Sky.

667
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,308
I know.

668
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,143
I know that now.

669
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,798
<i>Sky.</i>

670
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,640
Hey, baby.

671
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,505
Sky.

672
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,517
Half day today.

673
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:11,943
Hey, girl.

674
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,559
Hey, look here, sweetness.

675
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,517
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

676
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,715
My name's Chip Hightower.
My wife is inside.

677
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,516
I can't let you in.

678
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,025
Why the hell not?

679
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,424
You got two choices.

680
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,929
You can leave now,
or right fucking now.

681
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,198
Get out of my way. Hey, man.
Get your hands off the suit.

682
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,532
- You gonna pay for this suit?
- Hey, it's okay.

683
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:20,107
Ramon, he's with me.
Chip, come on.

684
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,638
- Sky is waiting.
- Hello, Ramon.

685
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:42,191
It's your lucky day, baby.
It's unlocked.

686
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,026
You ready?

687
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,071
- Hey, Chip.
- Hi.

688
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,119
I'm glad you're here.

689
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,349
Now I only have to give two
introductions at the same time.

690
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:13,724
Summer G, this is
Sky's husband, Chip.

691
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,457
I mean, Mr. Chip Hightower.

692
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,960
Chip Hightower.
Pleasure to finally meet you, brother.

693
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:26,434
Heard a lot about you.
Daizy, thanks for showing Chip in.

694
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,705
<i>Fuck you.</i>

695
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,277
Please, have a seat.

696
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,650
It's funny, Summer G and Sky
know each other...

697
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,880
...from back in the old college days.

698
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,149
FIT.

699
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,796
I don't want my wife
socializing with gangsters.

700
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,228
- Gangsters?
- Oh, God, Chip.

701
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,531
Well, Sky, I think somebody
should be honest here.

702
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,604
Now, I've read about
your little rap lifestyle...

703
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,904
...and I know what goes on in it.

704
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,547
I am not comfortable
with my wife being a part of it.

705
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,410
At least I can be
upfront about that.

706
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,744
Look, Chip, come on.

707
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,444
We don't have to believe
everything written in the press.

708
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,248
You wanna tell
me about the press?

709
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,017
So it's all a bunch of lies now, Tre?
Is that what it is?

710
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,392
I can't speak for the press...

711
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:23,090
...but as for my intentions,
they're completely honorable.

712
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,290
Always have been.

713
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,867
Always have been?

714
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,899
Then maybe you can tell me
why my wife finds it necessary...

715
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:34,567
...to hide a photo album of you
under the bed I sleep in.

716
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:43,076
Well, I don't know, Chip.
Like you said, she is your wife.

717
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,618
I've had enough of this.

718
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:48,246
If you wanna sit here and talk
about our personal business, fine.

719
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,892
But I'm leaving.

720
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,653
I'm leaving, Chip.

721
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,566
You have a nice day.

722
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,702
You too.

723
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,111
Oh, come on, I owe you, Tre.

724
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,279
Come on, Summer.

725
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,657
Tre, I owe you.

726
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,488
Summer, you told me you just wanted
to talk to my cousin.

727
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,959
That's what I agreed to.

728
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,190
Please, don't put me in the middle
of a situation...

729
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,130
...I'm gonna regret ever again.

730
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,660
Damn.

731
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,424
Sky.

732
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,288
You gotta tell me something here...

733
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,867
...or I'm gonna lose it.

734
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,063
Do you love this guy?

735
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,398
Do you wear condoms when
you fuck your ho's?

736
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,346
Do you love this man?

737
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,211
Do you wear condoms?
Don't fuck with me.

738
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,581
First of all, if I were a single man
and you weren't in my life, Sky...

739
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,847
...then, yes, I would.
Do you love this man?

740
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,515
Well, if I was a single woman
and I weren't in your life...

741
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:34,357
...then, yes,
I would love another man.

742
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,277
Again, Mr. Hightower,
I am truly sorry.

743
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,146
Please, send me
the dry-cleaning bill.

744
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,015
Gene, it's all right, I've got 50 more
where these came from.

745
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,884
Hey, Gene, Gene.

746
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,150
How's the...? How's the good fight?

747
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,624
- Sorry?
- You know, the Summer G guy.

748
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,387
You get him kicked
off the block yet?

749
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,794
That's what you guys
are trying to do, right?

750
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,366
We're not trying to get
anybody kicked off the block.

751
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,435
Yeah, cut the bullshit.
What's the problem?

752
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,732
Well, I don't know what you're
talking about. There is no problem.

753
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,501
No, no, no.
He has all his proper permits.

754
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,611
He's keeping his parties contained.

755
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,714
- He's respectful of his neighbors.
- Respectful?

756
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,645
Gene, this motherf...

757
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:35,122
Gene, this guy is
coming on to my wife...

758
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,883
...every chance he gets.

759
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,120
Now, how's that
for your fucking respectful...

760
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,363
- Excuse my language.
- No, that's all right.

761
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,364
I'm sorry, I just wasn't aware.
I'm sorry.

762
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,230
Know what he did
when I confronted him?

763
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,503
He threatened me.
He threatens me with a gun.

764
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,801
The guy has
an armed fortress in there.

765
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,138
Bodyguards running around
with automatic weapons.

766
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,303
I'm afraid to walk in public
with my own wife.

767
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,211
Well, Mr. Hightower,
you've gotta go to the police for this.

768
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,080
There's nothing that
the homeowners association can do.

769
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,017
The police, they need proof.
I need you.

770
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,181
I need you to close him down
and get him the hell off my block.

771
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,348
I'm terrified of him.

772
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,291
And now he's turned everybody
around here, including you.

773
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,863
- Lf it were your wife...?
- All right, Mr. Hightower.

774
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,159
- Just calm down.
- I'm calm.

775
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:19,801
All right, now look.

776
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,771
The chief of police
is a friend of mine.

777
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,134
And he is a member of
the homeowners association.

778
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,333
I can put a call in
to him to keep an eye out.

779
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,905
But I'm afraid there's
nothing we can do...

780
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,946
...unless you get Mr. G
to threaten you in front of us.

781
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,686
Well, I can do that.

782
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,920
Okay, okay.

783
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:48,156
I'll call him right now, okay?

784
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,661
Thank you, Gene.

785
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,355
No, no, really, I'm frustrated too.
Let's go.

786
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,051
No, no.

787
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,329
Oh, Summer.

788
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,062
I want you to know
that I've realized...

789
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,170
...that I made a big
mistake 10 years ago.

790
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,802
I left the man that I loved
more than anything...

791
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:42,877
...because I stopped believing
that he loved me.

792
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,408
And now we have one more chance
to make right in our 30s...

793
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,780
...what we did wrong
in our 20s, right?

794
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,148
Right.

795
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:58,149
So you're ready to leave Chip?

796
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:04,323
If I leave my world,
can you leave yours?

797
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,934
That's funny. What?

798
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,198
Sky, wait.

799
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,242
Now, I built this world for you.

800
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,209
I wanna share it with you.

801
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,375
Then show me what
I'm worth to you, Summer.

802
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,179
Look, it makes no sense
for us to give this up.

803
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,555
Remember
those three little words.

804
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,518
For me.

805
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:43,005
Otherwise, we're gonna lose
like we did before.

806
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,536
I gotta go.

807
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,969
Call me...

808
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,705
...later...

809
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:53,940
...tonight.

810
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,418
<i>Does hip-hop have heart?</i>

811
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,323
<i>Hell, yeah, hip-hop has heart.</i>

812
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,457
Summer G believed in me
when no one else would...

813
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,430
...and signed me to his record label.
You know what I'm saying?

814
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,001
That's where the heart is.

815
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,037
Every kid out there on the streets
struggling to get his...

816
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,969
...that's where the heart is.

817
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,633
- Now<i>...</i>
- Wait.

818
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,006
There's some shit Summer
does with his business...

819
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,705
...that I just wouldn't do
if I was running things.

820
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,248
- Oh, really?
- Word is bond.

821
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,352
If you don't mind,
can we go back on the...?

822
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,488
- Sure, go back there.
- Thank you, thank you.

823
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,714
Back in the day,
hip-hop's passion and heart...

824
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,654
...was heard through the lyrics.

825
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,455
Now the industry has become
one big commercial endorsement...

826
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,064
...and verses of product placement.

827
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:47,464
- You know, I mean, cars, jewelry.
- Word.

828
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,299
I guess what I'm asking is,
does today's hip-hop have heart?

829
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,940
Absolutely. Know what I'm saying.

830
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,508
It's still coming from the ghetto,
right from the gut.

831
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:58,374
You know what I'm saying?
Nowadays, it's just more outward.

832
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,880
We were talking about rats,
and roaches and cracks...

833
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,644
...in the ghetto back in the day.
Now we out of the ghetto.

834
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,051
Know what I'm saying? Now it's time
for us to show some upward mobility.

835
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:11,091
With fancy cars and what
you call bling-bling, diamonds?

836
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,557
If you can afford it.

837
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,197
- What's up, players and playettes.
- Oh, what is this?

838
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,059
Man, you know how
I'm doing these days.

839
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,860
- Who did you rob?
- Hey, bro, nobody.

840
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,503
I'm just upgrading my style a bit.
Know what I'm saying?

841
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:26,131
Now, come on, come on, gather round.
You too, come on, man. Gather round.

842
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,478
I'm gonna ask Nicole
to be my wife, yo.

843
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,311
- Word?
- Internal clarity.

844
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,080
Excellent. The whole nine.
They broke it down for me.

845
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,519
- Four carats, baby.
- That shit is fly, dog.

846
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,352
- And it ain't over.
- Big step, Craig.

847
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:47,053
It's not over. Thanks, man, thanks.
But it's not over. Step outside, y'all.

848
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,289
Because the brother's
blinging from all angles.

849
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,696
Bling-bling.

850
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,900
- That's right, y'all.
- Brother going out like that?

851
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,976
That's what I'm saying.
You know, you know.

852
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:03,840
So, what do you all think?

853
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,276
- I got three words for you, baby.
- What's that?

854
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,476
Recipe for disaster.

855
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,911
- I like the rims, though.
- What's she talking about?

856
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,820
Okay, let's see,
I saw Nicole today...

857
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:21,054
...having lunch in this fancy restaurant
with this lawyer dude, all right?

858
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,358
Lawyer dude? What you talking about,
lawyer dude?

859
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,525
You get his name?

860
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,536
Peter<i>...</i>

861
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,732
Peter Carlyle.

862
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,577
He's a friend of my lawyer's,
so he's been to a few parties out here.

863
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,616
I think he's listed.

864
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,222
Please don't let this be happening.

865
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:55,223
What's going on?

866
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,424
Looks like Nicole has been creeping
around town with another dude.

867
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,535
Didn't tell him.

868
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,767
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

869
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,373
Must have slipped her mind.

870
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,544
Look, if I may interject, Craig.

871
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:12,374
Craig, look, she's just having
lunch with her lawyer.

872
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:15,142
- There's no big deal.
- Yeah, word up, dog. That's real, man.

873
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,786
Come on, what's the beef, son?

874
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,215
What are you all,
stupid or something?

875
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,381
- Y'all know better than that shit.
- Craig, you all right?

876
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,618
Just crazy, brother.

877
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:02,127
Hey, Craig, you look nice.
Nicole's not here.

878
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:07,331
Okay, well, I have something really
important I wanna ask her tonight.

879
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:08,834
I'm not trying to play myself.

880
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,064
- I just need to know...
- I'm sorry, Craig.

881
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,471
I can't have this conversation with you.
You need to call her cell phone.

882
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,636
- I just...
- I'm sorry. Just call her cell phone.

883
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,024
Okay.

884
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:01,739
You fucked him
in my home, Sky?

885
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:06,013
You brought him into my house,
and you fucked him?

886
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,418
What the fuck is that?

887
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,089
Those aren't mine.

888
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,252
Oh, shit. Damn! Sky! Sky!

889
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,396
What the fuck, Sky? Jesus.

890
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,297
If you ever put your hands
on me again...

891
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,627
...I swear to God, I will kill you.

892
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,100
Do you hear me?

893
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,499
Do you hear me?

894
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,666
Do you hear me, Chip?

895
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:06,539
You would shoot me right now,
wouldn't you?

896
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,585
You would kill me?

897
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,017
What happened to us?

898
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,959
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

899
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,333
Oh, my God.

900
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:37,001
Oh, God. I'm so confused.

901
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,608
I'm so sorry.

902
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,929
Look, I know I fucked up
in the past...

903
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,935
...I am willing to do
whatever it takes...

904
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:09,037
...to make this right,
because I don't wanna lose you.

905
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,544
I just... I've made a mess
out of everything.

906
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,848
And I'll make it right.

907
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,493
I just don't wanna...
I don't wanna lose you.

908
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,410
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hello.

909
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:50,313
It me. I just wanted to hear your voice
before I went to bed.

910
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:55,014
And also to say I cannot wait
to see you tomorrow.

911
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,856
<i>I don't think it's gonna happen</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

912
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,054
Okay, well, that's cool.
That's cool.

913
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,927
So day after that? That'll be fine.

914
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,295
<i>I don't think so.</i>

915
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:11,633
<i>I don't wanna hang up on you,</i>
<i>but I have to go now, okay?</i>

916
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:17,609
- Oh, okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

917
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:51,041
Come here, girl. Come here.

918
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,447
Give me a second.

919
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,989
Tre?

920
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,029
Hey, brother.

921
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:52,673
I know it was you who set up the first
meeting between Summer and Sky.

922
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:57,505
I want you the fuck out
of my house now.

923
01:11:58,847 --> 01:11:59,939
Chip?

924
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,809
Yeah, baby.

925
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,701
Yo, fellas.
Nicole's cheating on me, man.

926
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:25,329
Straight up. She's going to fucking
dinners, movies, all kinds of shit, man.

927
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,065
- Oh, shit.
- Word.

928
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,040
I don't even know what to do, man,
whether to be sad or angry...

929
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,908
<i>...</i>or what the fuck to do.
- Fuck yeah, get angry.

930
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,346
See, this shit
happened to me years back.

931
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,816
This motherfucker's crazy,
trying to take somebody's woman.

932
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,955
You know where
this motherfucker lives?

933
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:44,559
- Hell, yeah. He's listed.
- I got the remedy.

934
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,321
- Right there.
- You sure?

935
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,760
Yeah, baby.

936
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,658
See, this the Summer
I'm talking about.

937
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,168
Know what I'm saying?
Fuck that businessman bullshit.

938
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,329
Good to be back.
Let's beat this nigga's ass.

939
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,135
Fuck yeah.

940
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:01,970
That's what I'm talking about.

941
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,975
What's going on?

942
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,577
- Nicole's fucking some other cat.
- She's giving away the pussy for free.

943
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,116
So we're gonna kick
that motherfucker's ass for free.

944
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:13,743
Hold on now, all right, you guys?
Come on, cool. Come on.

945
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,651
Think about this rationally, all right?

946
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:19,590
Now, Craig, if Nicole likes this guy,
then kicking his ass...

947
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,788
...is not gonna lead you two down
the road to proper reconciliation.

948
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,595
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Nothing, let's go.

949
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:29,033
Hey, hang on. Hold it. Summer.

950
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,900
This is not the kind
of press you want right now.

951
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:41,645
Dog, you don't need this.
It's me and Nicole, I'll take care of it.

952
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,219
Yo, Craig, fuck that.
Listen to me.

953
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,912
You feel that stuff pumping
through your veins right now?

954
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,218
It's anger. Use it.

955
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,795
Don't let anyone
take anything from you.

956
01:13:55,964 --> 01:14:00,333
It's time to handle your business, boy.
Handle your business.

957
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,305
Handle my business, man.

958
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,375
I got it.

959
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,946
- Handle my business, fellas.
- All right.

960
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,812
Get me Tre.

961
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,364
Summer.

962
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,198
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Come here.

963
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:40,568
I need you to call her.

964
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,300
Now!

965
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,537
Hey, Sky.

966
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,676
Look, I just... Don't... Don't hang up.

967
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,368
Okay? Just hold on.

968
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,411
Hold on.

969
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,848
Sky, it's me.

970
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,616
Look, I need to see you.

971
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,424
Well, I'm throwing
something tomorrow...

972
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,462
...and I'm making
a special announcement...

973
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,123
...and I need you to hear it.

974
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,005
At 11... 11:30?

975
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:47,971
Okay. I'll see you in the morning.

976
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,615
She'll come.

977
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,371
- I love you.
- Yeah?

978
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,206
Yeah.

979
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,714
Now it's your turn.

980
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,911
Chip! Chip!

981
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,682
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you for fucking doing this to me!

982
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:40,055
- Go. Drive!
- You bitch! You fucker!

983
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:45,097
Bitch, shut the fuck up, bitch!
Fuck this shit! I don't give shit...

984
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:57,133
Hey, what are you doing in here?

985
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,548
Shouldn't I be asking you
the same thing?

986
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:08,449
- What are you, living here now?
- No, no, no.

987
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:14,156
I'm not living here, Craig.
But, baby, why are you here?

988
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:15,887
Come on.

989
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:20,397
Craig, what are you doing here?

990
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:24,832
Nicole.

991
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,974
Baby, I love you so much.

992
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,818
Nicole, will you marry me?

993
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,116
Get up. Get up!

994
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,920
I can't even go to Dierdra's without you
running behind me checking on me.

995
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:51,623
- And coming here?
- Baby, it's been three years.

996
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,730
What do you
need to go to Dierdra's for?

997
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:57,338
What do you need space for
breathing room or any of that shit?

998
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,373
- Baby, I love you.
- Love is not enough, Craig.

999
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:03,477
It is not enough.
And you know what?

1000
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:05,670
I don't even think you know
how to love me.

1001
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:09,681
And I have given up hope believing
that you will know how to love me.

1002
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,615
- Who the fuck is this?
- Peter.

1003
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,689
- Peter? This is fucking Peter?
- Peter, baby, just go back inside.

1004
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,848
- What are y'all, fucking now?
- Go back inside.

1005
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,891
- No, don't go back inside.
- Go back inside.

1006
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,656
- You answer my question.
- This doesn't have to do with you.

1007
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:25,595
- What are you, fucking my woman?
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

1008
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,166
- Stop!
- Motherfucker!

1009
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:28,529
You know what, go home!

1010
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,969
Go back to Summer G's house, Craig.
Don't bring this shit here!

1011
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,540
You know what?
I'm not doing this with you anymore.

1012
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:38,009
- Go home!
- Oh, please.

1013
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:42,144
Please don't throw
everything we built...

1014
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:45,079
...for a fucking one-night stand.

1015
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,819
What's it been, a week, a month?

1016
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:51,917
A year.

1017
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,259
A year.

1018
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:03,768
Now go home.

1019
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:09,273
Go back to Summer G's house.

1020
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,924
Gene.

1021
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,769
Chip Hightower.

1022
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,029
Yeah.

1023
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:43,337
If you can guarantee me that you'll be
at Mr. G's house with the police...

1024
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:47,380
<i>...</i> I believe I can give you that reaction
that you very much need to see.

1025
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,519
Well, I'm more concerned about you,
Mr. Hightower. Are you all right?

1026
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,818
Now, don't you worry about me.
I'll be fine.

1027
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,185
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

1028
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:47,299
Shelly. Shelly.

1029
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,170
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1030
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:52,472
How are you?
I found this along the way.

1031
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:57,081
B. Smoov, you forgot I don't drink.

1032
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,813
I knew that. I knew that.

1033
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,616
It's water. Here's another water.

1034
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:06,958
So you enjoying yourself
at this fine party?

1035
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:13,133
Summer sure has a lot of friends.

1036
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,837
Yeah.

1037
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,733
You think he's happy?

1038
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:22,240
Yo, with all this,
who needs happiness?

1039
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,470
Happiness is one
of God's greatest gifts.

1040
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:29,214
Something I keep
trying to tell my sister.

1041
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:35,214
You know, sometimes
happiness is so hard to find.

1042
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:39,048
Happiness, real happiness.

1043
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:42,060
It's God's orgasm.

1044
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:48,601
Wait, let me ask you
a personal question.

1045
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:52,467
Do you experience
this God's orgasm?

1046
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,776
- Daily.
- Daily.

1047
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,178
My kind of woman.

1048
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,238
Fucking bitch!

1049
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,474
What the fuck is wrong
with that bitch?

1050
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:07,179
Fucking playing me?
You wanna fucking play me?

1051
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,915
I'll show you who can fucking play!

1052
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:28,138
- Listen, about the whole situation...
- Tre, now is not the time or the place.

1053
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:36,514
She's here.

1054
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:04,009
Hello, hello, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.

1055
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,647
- Hope you all are having a good time.
- Yeah!

1056
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,749
Good, good, good.

1057
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:12,318
Stick around. I think B. Mo is gonna
do something for everyone later.

1058
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,948
You know it. You know it.
Thank you.

1059
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:20,285
Good. Well, I called
everyone out tonight...

1060
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:23,056
...because I do have
a special announcement to make.

1061
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:24,589
Well...

1062
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,827
...it's pretty much gonna change
everything the way you know it.

1063
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,064
Well, there's no easy way to say this,
so I think I'll just say it.

1064
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,398
- I'm leaving the business.
- What?

1065
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,374
Goddamn.

1066
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,945
- What?
- No way!

1067
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:44,279
Yes, I'm giving it all up...

1068
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,613
...for the woman I love.

1069
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,582
The love of my life, actually.

1070
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,156
My soul mate.

1071
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:56,386
Thanks.

1072
01:23:56,564 --> 01:24:00,557
Happiness...
Happiness depends on it.

1073
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:08,906
As for me, I would like to thank you
personally for supporting my dream.

1074
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:11,007
My artists...

1075
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,710
...I'll miss you.

1076
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,878
And I love you. Thank you.

1077
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:21,954
Let's go.

1078
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:47,373
Sky. Chip.

1079
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,776
Thanks for coming.

1080
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,746
Why don't we go upstairs to my office
where it's quiet for us to speak?

1081
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,655
Hey, Chip. Hey, baby.
We need to talk.

1082
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:02,126
- What are you doing here?
- Tre invited me.

1083
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:06,461
Tre? Tre, Tre, come here.
Come here.

1084
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,159
- You invited her here?
- Yeah.

1085
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,703
- Well, you can deal with her.
- We need to... We need...

1086
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:15,299
Chip, I'm glad you
could make it, brother...

1087
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:19,709
...because I'd like to do
this face to face.

1088
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:23,711
Thing is, I'm in love with your wife.

1089
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,287
She's in love with me.

1090
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:29,680
We wanna live the rest
of our lives together.

1091
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,655
I'm sorry.

1092
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:36,726
Summer, I came here to let you know
that that's not happening.

1093
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:39,590
My husband and I
have been making...

1094
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,099
...some big mistakes
over the last couple of weeks...

1095
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:45,171
...but we've been talking,
and we're gonna work things out.

1096
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,799
We're gonna rebuild
our relationship.

1097
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,906
Summer, I'm married.

1098
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:54,879
I've made a commitment to that,
and I'm gonna stick to it.

1099
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:56,812
I'm sorry.

1100
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:01,348
All right. Now you heard
what my wife said.

1101
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,013
Daddy's home.

1102
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,386
So you stay the hell
away from my family.

1103
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:10,764
Whoa, whoa, Sky, Sky. Please.
This is a joke, right?

1104
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,265
Your mind must be clouded.
You remember the things we said...?

1105
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:16,596
Mr. G, the fact of the matter is,
I am not a saint.

1106
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,568
I made plenty of mistakes.

1107
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,267
So that's why I'm willing to forgive that
you ever put your hands on my wife.

1108
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,741
This time. Next time,
I'm not gonna be so forgiving.

1109
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,778
Yo, dog.

1110
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,541
I'm not gonna get angry.

1111
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:35,154
Look, me and Sky have something
you probably couldn't fathom.

1112
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:38,518
You don't know what you
stepped in the middle of.

1113
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:42,561
No, you have no idea
what you stepped in the middle of.

1114
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,930
Mrs. Hightower?

1115
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,633
Come on.

1116
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,246
No. No.

1117
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,085
How does a brother
get his car around here?

1118
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:13,117
Sky. Sky, don't do this.

1119
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:18,388
- Shut up, friend! Sky.
- Hey, she still loves you.

1120
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:21,660
So I want you to remember that
when you're fucking one of your ho's.

1121
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:25,135
Because I'm gonna damn sure
remember when I'm fucking my wife.

1122
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,568
Come on, man. What you gonna do?

1123
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,573
Here we go.

1124
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,769
Nothing. What could you do
10 years ago?

1125
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:35,313
Nothing. Because you
will always be a broke, ghetto...

1126
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,747
...punk-ass, wannabe-me bitch.

1127
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,653
Come on.

1128
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:41,978
Let him go!

1129
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:44,352
- Come on, Summer.
- Now! Let him go!

1130
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,618
Let him go.

1131
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:52,689
Sky, baby<i>...</i>

1132
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,200
Sky, come on.

1133
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:57,693
Summer.

1134
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,610
Summer, you told me
to handle my business.

1135
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:39,804
You told me to handle
my business, Summer.

1136
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,539
He told me to handle my business!

1137
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:57,293
Somebody call an ambulance.

1138
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:12,906
I'm sorry.

1139
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,480
I'm sorry.

1140
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:19,711
I'm sorry.

1141
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:21,582
Don't leave me.

1142
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:29,487
Oh, God, please help me.

1143
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,292
Oh, my God, please.

1144
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,565
Daizy sounds good.

1145
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:59,235
One more question
for the record, G.

1146
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:03,843
Does hip-hop have heart?

1147
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:08,180
You won't let this question go,
will you?

1148
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:11,885
I guess not.

1149
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,986
Hell no.

1150
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,959
We're a bunch
of heartless bastards.
