1
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,541
Did you see it? I think I got it.

2
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,187
That little piggy was fast.

3
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,849
Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill.
We all take credit.

4
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,627
- I got a side ache.
- You hit Enmebaragesi.

5
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,922
I'm pretty sure he had that
when he left the village.

6
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,558
That's not my spear.

7
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,103
My spear has feathers...
Okay, that one's got a feather.

8
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,707
Okay, that is my spear.
I'm sorry, man.

9
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,609
Great. Two spears.
Twice the killing power.

10
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,814
Thanks a lot.
Next time don't block my shot.

11
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,247
What? I didn't say...
Come on, not my fault.

12
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,015
Who stands in front of a boar
on a hunt?

13
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,159
Hey, there you are.

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,769
I don't think you wanna be gathered.
You wanna be eaten.

15
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,365
Hi, Marlak.

16
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,577
Well, there won't be any berries
in the fruit salad now, so we all lose.

17
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,280
Hey, Oh. How's it going?

18
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,644
Hunters think they're so cool.
You know, they...

19
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,310
They don't think this is challenging?
Gathering? It's extremely challenging.

20
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,925
You have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it...

21
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,389
...and put it in the basket.

22
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,653
Are they picking on you?

23
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,319
If they're picking on you,
I will straighten them out.

24
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,989
- All right. Yeah, would you?
- You're right.

25
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,429
Let it slide this time.

26
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,628
Next time, though, they will feel the tip
of my short spear.

27
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,103
- What happened to your spear?
- I modified it. Made it a snub nose.

28
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:34,337
It's lighter. It's a better killing tool.
Anyway...

29
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,877
Oh, there's Maya.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

30
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,885
I'll be right back.
Unless something goes horribly right.

31
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:46,154
- Hello, Maya.
- Hey, Zed.

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,891
What do I gotta do
to make you my woman?

33
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:55,194
Look, you're a special guy.
You've got a lot of personality.

34
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,428
When my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs...

35
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,335
...you really helped me
see the funny side.

36
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,973
"No, no! He's got my ankle!"

37
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,370
"Get off." That's your mom.

38
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,680
So, yeah, you make me laugh,
but that's not enough.

39
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,446
I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl.

40
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,592
I need a man who can protect me
and take care of me.

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,283
What do you mean?
Like Marlak?

42
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,191
Well, I mean, he is the best hunter
in the village.

43
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,195
- Debatable.
- People voted.

44
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,394
Maybe I'm not the greatest hunter.

45
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,934
- Or gatherer.
- Yes. Or gatherer.

46
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,572
Zed, those are the only two jobs
that we have here.

47
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,573
I can take care of you.
Does it look like I'm starving?

48
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,406
Come on.
Tell me you can say no to this.

49
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,839
Give it a second. Let it work on you.

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,245
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely can say no to that.

51
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,446
Maya. Can I see you later?

52
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,353
I think I have to wash my hair.

53
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,797
You washed your hair last year.

54
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,767
Tonight, we feast.

55
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,210
Maya. For you.

56
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,905
Thanks, Marlak.
Another severed boar's head.

57
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,209
- It's a different color.
- Yeah, this one is...

58
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,649
- Left the tongue in.
- Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak.

59
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,757
Look at Marlak flirting with Maya.
He doesn't know her at all.

60
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,825
Head's not even the best part
of the boar.

61
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,761
It's the back fat, stupid.
Muscleheaded idiot.

62
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:37,232
Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema.

63
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,129
Yeah. She doesn't even know I exist.

64
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,041
There's like 60 people
in the village. I mean...

65
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,338
...you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists.

66
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,572
I just wanna lay with her so badly.

67
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,014
I don't see it. She's cute,
but I don't think I'd lay with her.

68
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,246
She's your sister. I mean,
that'd be like laying with your mother.

69
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,391
Which was a big mistake.
I see that now.

70
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,019
You think it's not gonna be awkward
in the morning, but... Trust me, wow.

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:04,697
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

72
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,894
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

73
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,332
...at the feast tonight
then drag her back to your hut.

74
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,166
My hut's a mess right now,
and what if she struggles?

75
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,002
You give her a little tap on the head.
Women respond to that.

76
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:19,064
I still live with my parents.

77
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:22,144
I don't wanna keep them up all night
with my raucous lovemaking.

78
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,940
I'd get an earful in the morning.
She only likes hunters.

79
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:28,175
She doesn't like gatherers.
She's a gatherer herself is the irony.

80
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,819
She's a self-loathing gatherer.

81
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:36,255
- That's pretty suggestive.
- I wouldn't read too much into that.

82
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,293
Okay, now she's just asking
for some splinters.

83
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,890
Hey, hey... Squanto.
Give me a break, would you?

84
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,228
You got the whole forest.

85
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:49,566
Why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut?

86
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,836
I could be wrong, I think what it is
is that all the poop in the area...

87
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:58,345
...fertilizes the ground and it gives
the leaves a softer feel for wiping.

88
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:02,952
It's not that nobody respects you.
I haven't heard that from everyone.

89
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,712
I've had it. Let's go.

90
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,114
Where are we going?
We're not supposed to go this far.

91
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,783
I'm sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke.

92
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,293
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Change villages.

93
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:16,125
No. I'm gonna change my head.

94
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,793
I don't think that's possible.
Your head is attached to your body.

95
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,666
Not the whole head.
I mean, my mind.

96
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,965
Mind...

97
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,735
Don't tell me you're thinking
about eating forbidden fruit.

98
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,435
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

99
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,605
Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

100
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:35,183
You don't eat from that one.
It's forbidden.

101
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,580
But why is it forbidden?

102
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:38,653
What is it they don't want us
to have?

103
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:42,280
It's not the fruit. It's about the rule.
It's about doing what you're told.

104
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,893
We've been doing what we were told
our entire lives.

105
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:47,530
- How's that worked out?
- I like doing what I'm told.

106
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:50,030
It gives my day
some much-needed structure. Wait.

107
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,963
Zed. Stop.
It's just a piece of fruit.

108
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:54,194
Eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life.

109
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,100
What if it's magic fruit?

110
00:07:56,273 --> 00:08:00,107
What if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known?

111
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:01,676
That's a pretty low bar.

112
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:04,109
Then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me.

113
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,805
Maya would lay with me like that.

114
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,974
That's what this is about?
Laying with Maya?

115
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,779
I have a great destiny,
I'm about to find out what it is.

116
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,013
Put the fruit down.
What if somebody sees us?

117
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,091
They'll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill.

118
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:19,558
Now you've done it.

119
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,728
It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste.

120
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,869
Does it have a sort of forbidden taste?
That's what it is.

121
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:30,097
- Oh, I definitely feel something.
- What?

122
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:34,801
Less hungry, for one,
but also more intelligenter.

123
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:38,178
It's like
I feel like maybe I know everything.

124
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:43,446
Ask me something. Anything. Go.
Test me. Go.

125
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,850
All right, where does the sun go
at night?

126
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,120
Pass. Next question.

127
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:51,653
- Okay, where do babies come from?
- Pass. Next question.

128
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:56,061
- There's a snake on my foot.
- In the form of a question.

129
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,030
There's a snake on my foot?

130
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,801
- Correct.
- What do I do?

131
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:06,170
I got a lot of ideas. I'm bursting
with ideas on the subject.

132
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:09,835
- It's constricting me.
- You could stick your finger in its hole.

133
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,811
You know what, you could eat it
before it eats you. Try that.

134
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,679
Eat the snake first.
That's what my new brain tells me.

135
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,945
- It's preparing to eat me.
- Go for the eyes.

136
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,089
It's big.

137
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,448
Zed, please help me.

138
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:26,990
I'm dying a virgin.

139
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,428
Wait right here.
I'm gonna go eat more fruit.

140
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:47,047
- This was a bit of a rough day for me.
- Yeah. There's gotta be more to life.

141
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:50,277
This is a lot. I don't think I can handle
too much more than this.

142
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:52,513
No way. Look at these people.

143
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,125
They're like animals.
We're way too good for this.

144
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,625
Now that I'm smarter
I'm going straight to the top.

145
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:01,059
I'm bringing you.
You're gonna be my right hand.

146
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,563
I've seen what you do
with your right hand. No.

147
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:06,430
Don't you wonder what's on
the other side of the mountains?

148
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:09,231
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains, okay?

149
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:12,637
The world ends. Everybody
knows that. You'd fall right off of it.

150
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,037
But what if it doesn't?

151
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,941
It makes my stomach go:

152
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:20,478
I've been thinking a lot
ever since I ate that fruit.

153
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,084
Why is there fruit? What is fruit?

154
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:26,322
It's a thing that you eat.
Why do we eat?

155
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,982
What are we? What are we?
Why do I have these?

156
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,060
Everything is weird.

157
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:35,824
When you really stop and look at it,
everything gets very, very strange...

158
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,466
Why am I talking? What is this?

159
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,864
My lips make a movement
and then a sound...

160
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:41,936
...and you know what I mean.

161
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:43,936
Blows my mind.

162
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:48,073
That just sounds like crazy fruit talk.
I don't wanna hear it right now.

163
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,212
Boy, she looks nice tonight.

164
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:55,176
Do it, man. Dance for her.

165
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,411
I don't know.
They're doing the jackal dance.

166
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,020
It's not my strongest.

167
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:02,590
What, are you kidding me?
You have an amazing jackal dance.

168
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,728
Go. Jackal dance.

169
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:28,043
Get into it.

170
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:36,252
<i>Over the head.</i>

171
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:57,338
I'm gonna go and eat.
I'm gonna come back.

172
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:04,482
Your father was a great hunter.
But you, you're like a little girl.

173
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:06,980
Good one, Marlak.

174
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,227
Enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden.

175
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,659
Really? Well, what if I told you
that Enmebaragesi was a liar?

176
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:17,356
I saw him eat the forbidden fruit.

177
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:20,002
Oh, that.

178
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:25,464
- Hey, what's going on here?
- I will kill you where you stand.

179
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:28,475
Oh, a shooting star. That's the best.

180
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:44,450
- You really ate the fruit?
- One bite. What's the big deal?

181
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:46,823
You don't eat the fruit.

182
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,431
It's the number one rule
since the beginning of time.

183
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,796
Since the Great Turtle climbed out
of the sea with Earth on its back.

184
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:55,836
I know, but I'm a little fuzzy
on the exact details.

185
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:58,566
Forbidden. Forbidden fruit.

186
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:04,442
You ate... You did the one thing
you're not supposed to do. Forbidden.

187
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:08,414
But the word "forbidden" implies
there's a little wiggle room.

188
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:11,748
There's no wiggle room
with forbidden. You're cursed, man.

189
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:16,256
If you stay here, we'll all be cursed.
You have to leave.

190
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,054
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I didn't eat the fruit.

191
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,253
My hands are tied.

192
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,922
I know I'm being a dick right now, man,
but I'm just trying to help you.

193
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,466
Do I detect a little bit of jealousy
because I now have...

194
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,934
...the knowledge of good and evil
and you don't?

195
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:32,131
You think it's easy being the shaman
of the village?

196
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,368
You think I like putting on
a boar's head every morning?

197
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,307
Putting a bone through my face?

198
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:39,642
I know we've known each other for
a long time. We throw the rock around.

199
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:43,411
We have fun together, man,
but I can't be...

200
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:44,848
You know what I mean?

201
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:49,117
Plus, wanna know something?
I am high as shit right now, dude.

202
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,760
I just licked like three toads.

203
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:55,056
I've been up for like 27 suns up
and suns downs.

204
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,199
- Okay.
- I just wanna get a meal...

205
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,029
...I wanna take a fucking nap.
- This is bullshit.

206
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:03,904
You really... You fucked the pooch
on this one.

207
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:06,607
- Hard.
- I say what I did...

208
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:07,970
...was a good thing.
- Oh, yeah?

209
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,806
Yeah. Really, really very good thing.

210
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:13,506
And I should know because I have
the knowledge of good and evil.

211
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:15,082
- Oh, okay.
- So I ought to know...

212
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,812
...when I know what I'm saying
is what I know what I'm saying.

213
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,957
- Good.
- And I'm not leaving.

214
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,891
You better get out of here.

215
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,433
Okay, but before I go,
I just wanna say one thing.

216
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:35,127
I know I'm not the greatest hunter.

217
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:38,866
- Or gatherer.
- Or gatherer. Thank you.

218
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,600
But there's gotta be more to life
than this.

219
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,666
I'm going, but because I choose to.

220
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:47,240
And anyone who wants to join me
is welcome.

221
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:50,575
I don't know where we're going,
but I will lead us.

222
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:53,809
Yeah, light up the darkness.

223
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:55,850
So who's with me?

224
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,415
Anyone?

225
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,287
Anyone named Oh?

226
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:08,265
Okay. Looks like
I'm gonna be going it alone.

227
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,860
Which is fine with me.

228
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,468
Better, in fact...

229
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:14,434
...because having a partner
would just probably slow me down.

230
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,665
I'm gonna start a new tribe,
10 times better.

231
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:19,139
There's gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun.

232
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,306
It's gonna be called Muscle Tribe
of Danger and Excellence.

233
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:29,476
And you're not invited. I don't even like
any of you guys. I never did.

234
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,653
Unless anyone changes their mind.
Does anyone wanna come?

235
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:36,187
- We're good.
- Fine. Good. Bye-bye.

236
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:40,958
Don't... Nobody panic.

237
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:52,208
No! That's... That's...
Oh, it's not my house.

238
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,268
I see you.

239
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:28,576
Go away, Marlak.

240
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:32,773
- Really, animal noises?
- Badger.

241
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,111
This is just insulting.
It's time I killed you.

242
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,722
Fine. But then, tell me this:
Who's that behind you?

243
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:43,520
You think I'm gonna turn around?
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

244
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,165
Nice whack on the head.
You should try hitting Eema that hard.

245
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,705
We can discuss that later.
We should run away.

246
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,036
Yes, yes, of course.

247
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:04,409
So you decided to come after all.
Was it the speech?

248
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:07,745
- It was the fire. I lost everything.
- Yeah.

249
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,386
I wish we didn't have to leave.

250
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,215
Probably never gonna see
Eema again.

251
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:14,620
That's not true. We'll go back.

252
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,589
Those hunters are idiots.

253
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,956
They're gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour.

254
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,564
Will you get real, man?
There's no going back, okay?

255
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,224
There's nothing to go back to.
It's just ashes.

256
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,627
Like it's hard to build
one of those huts.

257
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,533
It's just a pile of sticks and dung.

258
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:30,508
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

259
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,304
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

260
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,636
- I'm sorry, l...
- It's okay.

261
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:37,280
- I don't mean that, obviously.
- I know you're mad...

262
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,609
...but this is a great
opportunity for us.

263
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,911
They didn't appreciate you
back there.

264
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:45,283
You're the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd.

265
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,287
They were all drinking from their
hands.

266
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,188
Well, it just seems practical.
I mean, I don't know.

267
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,455
We have an incredible destiny.

268
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:57,126
You don't even know where we are.
We're lost.

269
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,532
Of course I know where we are.

270
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:06,476
It's a cougar.
Don't move a muscle.

271
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:09,238
- What do we do?
- Don't move your lips.

272
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:13,248
Rule number one: Show no fear.

273
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:14,612
You're showing fear.

274
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,814
Much better. Very good.

275
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,982
- Now what?
- There's two opinions on this one.

276
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,290
Some say run,
others say stay perfectly still.

277
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:31,800
- Which one are you gonna do?
- I'm going to run!

278
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:52,749
You should put some maggots
on those scratches.

279
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,391
They look pretty deep.

280
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,426
They are very deep.
That's why they appear that way.

281
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,027
- You're still mad at me, aren't you?
- I wish I hadn't come.

282
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,666
Maybe you shouldn't have come...

283
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,598
...if you're gonna keep whining
about every little cougar...

284
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,397
...that attacks you.

285
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,900
Oh, what does this look like?

286
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,205
You making your own fire?

287
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,710
No, I'm making arrows.
We're gonna need them.

288
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:21,148
- You still coming?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:24,716
Yeah!

290
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:30,456
Yeah. You're my buddy. Yeah.

291
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,321
You're saying we're gonna walk...

292
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:35,554
...and eventually we're gonna get
to a spot where the world ends...

293
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,757
...and it's like... What is it?
What are we looking at?

294
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:42,370
First of all, why are you talking to me
in that tone like I'm an idiot?

295
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,165
This is general knowledge.

296
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:57,441
- I knew it!
- This is incredible.

297
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,519
You still think the world just ends?

298
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:02,555
Come on, admit it. The fruit man
has the knowledge.

299
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:04,817
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

300
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,289
Did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit?

301
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:13,435
Yeah. I can see, like, 10 minutes
into the future now.

302
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:16,935
- So what am I doing in ten minutes?
- You're having sex with a zebra.

303
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,697
- That's not funny.
- I'm not joking.

304
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:20,967
Hope you're ready to bone some zeeb.

305
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,840
People. More than one.

306
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:29,245
Walking that way.

307
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,852
You think? There's about
a thousand footprints there.

308
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,284
- I mean, it's kind of obvious.
- Oh, yes.

309
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,584
- They stopped here to poop. Look.
- No, I don't want to.

310
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,093
Two men, maybe three. A child.
Or a small woman, maybe.

311
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:45,098
What are you doing?
You don't know where that's been.

312
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,394
- I know where it's been.
- Don't touch it.

313
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,594
You don't know if a squirrel
has peed on it.

314
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:52,501
Still warm.
Almost hot in the center.

315
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:56,968
Looks like they had some nuts.
Apples, maybe.

316
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:59,113
What are you doing?

317
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,639
- Yep, apples.
- What difference does it make?

318
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,648
That doesn't help us to know that.

319
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:08,853
You can tell if they ate some shit.
There's a lot of shit in that shit.

320
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:11,492
My mistake, this is bear poop.

321
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:13,492
What's that, though?

322
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:23,564
This one's mine.

323
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:28,071
Tonight, we feast.

324
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,412
We're gonna need
some arrowheads.

325
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,496
This is where you die!

326
00:21:54,202 --> 00:21:55,726
Easy, easy.

327
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:58,134
He won't get far.

328
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:03,042
- Did you shoot my cow?
- Oh, no.

329
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:06,777
Yes. Well, we're hunters.

330
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:08,541
Well, he's a hunter. I'm a maker.

331
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:13,677
- A maker?
- I made this loincloth. I make arrows.

332
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:16,289
I've made a shelf unit for my hut.

333
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:20,458
I welcome us to you.

334
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,360
- What do you do?
- What does it look like?

335
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:26,156
- We're farmers.
- Well, he's a farmer, I'm a herdsman.

336
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:27,798
You're a suck is what you are.

337
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:31,299
- My brother Cain. I'm called Abel.
- You are called "suck."

338
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,995
There you go with that "suck."
What does that mean?

339
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:36,766
Short for "suckle."
Short for "suckle up."

340
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:40,708
You're suckling up to God.
You're a suckle-up.

341
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:43,848
Somebody's upset because God
looked on my sacrifice with favor.

342
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:46,678
"God looked upon my sacrifice
with favor." I mean...

343
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:48,220
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

344
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,380
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

345
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,317
Why are you bringing these guys
in it?

346
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,151
- They live in a tree.
- Oh, see?

347
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:56,761
I mean, come on. You just gotta be
so superior to everyone else.

348
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:59,329
No, but superior to... Than you.

349
00:22:59,498 --> 00:23:02,399
Superior... Let's see how superior
you are when I kick your ass.

350
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,398
- Oh, yeah?
- You want some of that?

351
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:06,127
- Yes, I do.
- Guys.

352
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:09,433
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- No, come on.

353
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:13,874
No. This smug asshole insulted you,
and I want him to take it back.

354
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:16,310
- We're not that insulted.
- Why don't you make me?

355
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:19,279
No, no. Boys, boys.
You are brothers. Let's just relax...

356
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,079
...and let's all just get
some perspective...

357
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:25,820
Yeah. Yeah. That's how we do it.
That's how we do it. That's...

358
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:28,482
- There are rules that we abide by.
- Yeah, right.

359
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:34,593
- Should we do something?
- Just let them settle it.

360
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:36,597
I tripped.

361
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,238
Well, I guess that settles it.

362
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,604
- What?
- Nothing.

363
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:52,440
It's... He's all right.
He's just... He's resting.

364
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:55,576
Well, he's tuckered out
from the fight.

365
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:57,745
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's... You know what?

366
00:23:57,923 --> 00:24:00,483
Let's cover him up with a little dirt
and some straw...

367
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,059
...to keep him warm
until he wakes up and...

368
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:07,130
Hey. Abel, what are you doing
with my foot? Playing possum?

369
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,561
Hey. Oh, hey, stop it.
He's choking me.

370
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:15,995
Stop it, Abel. Are you trying
to choke me to death, Abel?

371
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:18,540
"Yes, Cain, I am."
Come on, stop it!

372
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,669
Self-defense. Clearly. Self-defense.

373
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,313
What have I done?
What have I done?

374
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,287
What have I done again?
What have I done some more?

375
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:52,176
What have I continued to do?

376
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:55,640
Oh, guys.
Guys, we're in some real trouble here.

377
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,475
What do you mean, "we"?

378
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,083
I don't wanna play the blame game
but you hit him.

379
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:02,686
No, no, no. There's two of you
and there's one of me.

380
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:05,846
- You could have stopped me.
- Didn't know you were gonna kill him.

381
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:09,255
- Are you calling me a murderer?
- Did I say that?

382
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:12,522
It was an accident. Right?

383
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:14,961
Yeah, you were holding a rock...

384
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,431
...and he ran into it
with his face repeatedly...

385
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:20,162
...until he just couldn't pull through.

386
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,135
- It was horseplay.
- It was horseplay.

387
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:24,172
It was two horses playing.

388
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:27,106
One murders the other one...

389
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:32,980
Yeah. It's probably best if we
didn't mention this accident to anyone.

390
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:35,642
Because, you know,
people don't understand, and...

391
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:36,981
Who am I gonna tell?

392
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:39,123
I can't think of one
who'd be interested.

393
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,521
I'd only tell him
and he's a witness as well.

394
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:43,820
- Why even bring it up?
- Okay.

395
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,862
- It's like he killed himself.
- Cry for help, if anything.

396
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:49,500
All right. Good.

397
00:25:50,902 --> 00:25:55,339
I like you guys. I do.
I like you guys a lot. I do.

398
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:57,737
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

399
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,969
- We already have dinner plans.
- Damn.

400
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,910
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

401
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,141
We'll come over to your place
for supper.

402
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,650
I mean, how many times
do we see you?

403
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:11,113
- Just don't kill me.
- No horseplay.

404
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:13,154
- What?
- Nothing.

405
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,455
What are these big,
round things for?

406
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:20,257
They're wheels, numbskull.
They make the cart roll.

407
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:38,879
I feel like a bird.

408
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,880
Bring it forth.

409
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,090
Hello.

410
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,232
I'm gonna yak.

411
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:07,243
Hey. What's wrong with you?

412
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:10,609
- Let me get your hair.
- That was too fast.

413
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,656
Cain, I ask you again,
where is thy brother Abel?

414
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,822
I don't know.
I haven't really seen him at all.

415
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,232
Have you... You guys...
You guys haven't seen him, have you?

416
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:35,464
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't... Never...

417
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,507
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- What's his name?

418
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:42,135
- Sure he's out there somewhere...
- I haven't seen anybody anywhere.

419
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:45,306
Never had the pleasure.
Sure he's in the prime of his life.

420
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:48,942
This is good soup. Really good.

421
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,486
Lilith said she saw you
in the field with him.

422
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:54,250
Oh, man, this bread is good.

423
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:59,353
Oh, really? That... Oh, yeah.
No, that was yesterday, right.

424
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,931
No, this day.
She said you both made offerings.

425
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:04,764
- Oh, that was Boaz. Yeah.
- No.

426
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,665
- Japheth. It was Japheth.
- No.

427
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:08,203
- Enoch.
- No.

428
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,840
- I'm sure it was Gilgamesh.
- No.

429
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:11,498
- Ishmael.
- No.

430
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,802
- Ezidia?
- No.

431
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:14,206
- Jennifer?
- No.

432
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,574
Now I'm remembering correctly.
It was Tishbaven.

433
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:19,216
It was you. She said
it looked like you were arguing.

434
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:24,686
Yeah, well, let's be honest.
Lilith is a lying bitch.

435
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:28,189
Look, I mean, we're brothers.
We're gonna argue, it's human nature.

436
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,454
- Show me the perfect family.
- His flock goes untended in the field.

437
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,430
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

438
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,057
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

439
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:37,292
I mean, just get off my back, Father.

440
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:41,803
I wish you were dead too.
Even though Abel's not dead at all.

441
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,735
I fear the worst for Abel.
I'm sorely vexed.

442
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:48,813
You're welcome to spend this night
with us.

443
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,880
You may lay with my daughter Lilith.

444
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:53,546
She is without a husband...

445
00:28:53,717 --> 00:28:56,208
...and as the Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply."

446
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:58,778
What about me?

447
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:01,116
You may share the bed
of my son Seth.

448
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,316
- Thanks, Papa.
- Yeah, there you go.

449
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:06,419
I multiplied with sheep.

450
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:08,154
Smell that.

451
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:11,423
Hello.

452
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,964
Feeling fruitful?

453
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:20,667
My bed is small but you're welcome
to share it. It's the way of my people.

454
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,074
That is such a good way to be.

455
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:30,484
In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty
girl like you is sleeping alone, anyway.

456
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:33,054
I'd have thought
guys would be lined up at the door.

457
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:37,489
- Oh. I don't like men.
- Maybe...

458
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:40,357
...you just ain't met the right one yet.

459
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,094
Loincloth rising.

460
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:55,640
- No, I like girls.
- We have that in common.

461
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:58,508
No, I'm attracted to women.

462
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,545
I don't even know what that means.

463
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:12,390
- What does that mean?
- I like to have sex with other women.

464
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:16,456
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
All my brain blood was in my boner.

465
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,302
That was such a good one.

466
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:25,998
Okay, here we go. Ready, ready?

467
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,671
No, wait.

468
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:40,821
Little surprise on the end
of that one, right?

469
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:43,186
- Very good.
- One more, ready?

470
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:49,690
No, we're good.
Oh, do you wanna see a trick?

471
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,326
Do I have to?

472
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:57,138
Your brother Seth
is an interesting guy.

473
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:59,974
Did you know he can put
his own penis in his mouth?

474
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,576
I did not know that.

475
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,940
Whole thing. Right in there.

476
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,545
It's been a great sleepover...

477
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:10,618
...and thank you
for the gruel and the garb.

478
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,849
- Where's everybody going?
- To look for thy brother Abel.

479
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:17,016
- Good luck.
- What?

480
00:31:17,193 --> 00:31:20,253
I said, good luck, Father.
I'm really worried about him.

481
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,556
You're not coming?

482
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:24,859
I'm just gonna stay here
and finish toiling...

483
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,666
...and then we'll be right behind you.
- Good.

484
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,641
Hey, I'm heading to the coast.
You guys should come with me.

485
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,074
They're gonna try to blame this
whole Abel-killing business on you.

486
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:40,372
- Why blame it on us?
- When they find him...

487
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:44,177
...and see his head, they're gonna
start pointing fingers. You're drifters.

488
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,114
They're gonna put two
and two together.

489
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:49,484
Now stop asking so many questions
and let's go. Go, go, go.

490
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:02,028
Cain. After him.

491
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:11,636
- They're gaining on us.
- They're getting away.

492
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:15,646
- Eat my dust, Father.
- This is really too fast.

493
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,943
- Oh, no, no.
- Hold tight. Hold tight.

494
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,112
Cain! My justice will be swift.

495
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:27,554
No. No! Damn you, Cain.

496
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,162
Who's in God's favor now, Father?

497
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:41,263
What are the odds of that?
Hey, am I lucky or what?

498
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:42,466
Your head's smoking.

499
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,207
Hey, it didn't leave a mark, did it?

500
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,146
Just a pink, red hole.

501
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:53,684
- Your bangs are gonna cover it.
- All right. Whatever.

502
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,249
This is the biggest place
I've ever seen.

503
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:02,691
It's called a town. Just act normal.

504
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,965
- Hi.
- Hello. Greetings, seafarer.

505
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,566
- That's not normal.
- Hello.

506
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,169
Would you stop saying
hi to everybody? It's annoying.

507
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:13,738
All right, this is a market.
Over there is a Build-A-Bear.

508
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:18,406
That's a really good container store.
Oh, this place has killer hemp.

509
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,441
- Yes, please.
- Next up is an unusual item.

510
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:28,445
- He's big. He's strong.
- It's Marlak.

511
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:31,918
Oh, do not worry. He is not fighting,
he is having fun.

512
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,460
Okay, maybe he's
little bit depressed.

513
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:40,267
Maya and Eema.

514
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:43,459
- Zed.
- Eema.

515
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:46,299
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Gosh.

516
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,600
What happened?
How did you get here?

517
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,973
After the fire that you started,
the hill tribes raided the village.

518
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,204
They held us captive...

519
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,474
...and traded us to the boat people,
who brought us here.

520
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,881
So it's such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here.

521
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:02,420
- You think it's a coincidence?
- What do you think?

522
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,323
I'm not sure, but I'm beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason.

523
00:34:08,495 --> 00:34:11,157
God wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil.

524
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:14,165
- Why would he want that?
- Why are we assuming God's a he?

525
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,565
I don't know what to say to that.

526
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:22,132
You kidding?

527
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:25,611
Anyway, don't you guys see
what I'm saying?

528
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:26,871
Why would he choose you?

529
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:29,106
Why wouldn't he choose
someone stronger?

530
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:31,979
Chosen doesn't have to be strong.
I'm big like this.

531
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:34,347
- You have a fat face.
- My brain. It's enormous.

532
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,682
I'm smarter than you are.
I don't talk as much.

533
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,586
I'm the smartest guy in the village.

534
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:40,818
I'm the smartest guy
that was in the village.

535
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,657
Excuse me,
you are interested in some slaves?

536
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:45,625
Yes.

537
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:49,428
- This one looks pretty good.
- And her little friend. Very good.

538
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:51,127
- Just how I like them.
- Hey.

539
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:52,704
Feisty.

540
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:54,966
So how do we do this
if we want them?

541
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:58,606
You have money?

542
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:00,542
That depends
on what you mean by money.

543
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:03,512
Excuse me.
Perhaps I could be of some help here.

544
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:07,609
You guys, let me deal with this guy,
see if I can work out a deal.

545
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:09,776
What happened to your forehead?

546
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:13,549
I didn't murder my brother. I didn't.

547
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,249
All right, I'm just gonna...

548
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,587
We're gonna get you out of this.
You trust me?

549
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:22,598
- I want to trust you.
- Fair enough.

550
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,729
Next up is a twofer.
It is two for price of one.

551
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:32,398
Have a great vacation.

552
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,067
Never trusted that guy.

553
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,304
Because he murdered his brother
with a rock?

554
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,882
Is that why you didn't trust him?
You got great instincts.

555
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:53,189
Sorry, do you think you could move
your hands, please?

556
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:54,991
Yeah.

557
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,532
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

558
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:03,163
Enmebaragesi, can you move that way
a little bit? We're crowded back here.

559
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,901
Oh, yeah, no problem.
How's that?

560
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:09,136
Look, I want you to know...

561
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:12,180
...I blame myself for everything
that's happened.

562
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,810
- Yeah. So does everybody else.
- Stay away from my woman.

563
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:20,287
Not gonna be possible, Marlak.

564
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:24,256
She's not your woman.
You can't own people.

565
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:27,421
Except for the guy who bought
all of us. Apparently, he can.

566
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:28,758
- That's it.
- What?

567
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,867
- I'm gonna kill you!
- "I'm gonna kill you."

568
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,868
You always say, "I'm gonna kill you"
and you never do.

569
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:39,741
Be still. Don't make me come in there.

570
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,345
I'd like to see you try.

571
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,593
Take the slaves!

572
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:04,367
Go!

573
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,240
Eema, run like a cougar
is chasing you.

574
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:14,336
- Zed!
- Eema.

575
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,806
Come here, you two.

576
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,305
Go, go, go, go.

577
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:34,020
Sir, shall we pursue the slaves?

578
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,229
Let the desert have them.
They won't get far.

579
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,159
Yes, sir.

580
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,378
- Orders, sir?
- Tend to the slaves.

581
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,680
- We leave for Sodom before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.

582
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,049
I wonder who they are.

583
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:01,824
Their hats are really great,
aren't they?

584
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:03,324
Their hats?

585
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,553
When that guy
cut the other guy's head off...

586
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,721
...I wasn't thinking about
what a great hat.

587
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:11,767
It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd
be lying if I said it wasn't up there.

588
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,961
I'm just saying, if I can snag one,
I'm going to.

589
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:17,603
Now I just have to figure out a way
to rescue Maya and Eema.

590
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:21,108
How are we gonna rescue them?
These guys are killers.

591
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:25,111
Even killers have to sleep sometime.

592
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,818
That was refreshing.

593
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:39,487
Shit!

594
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,155
They're gone.

595
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,388
Now where do we go?

596
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:49,502
They said they were going to Sodom.
We're going to Sodom.

597
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:54,974
I think I have sand in my ass,
but there's no way of knowing for sure.

598
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:58,134
I'll take a look in it
when we get to Sodom.

599
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:02,245
We making a burnt offering
or something?

600
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,783
Yes, Isaac.
As God has commanded me.

601
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:07,682
But I don't see the sheep anywhere.

602
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:12,417
The Lord. The Lord shall provide
the sheep, my son.

603
00:39:12,593 --> 00:39:14,857
What is this?
Is this some sort of magic trick?

604
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:18,055
In a way. In a way.

605
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:22,427
If this is because I didn't clean up
my tent, I'm sorry.

606
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:24,571
I'll do it right when I get home.

607
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,229
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

608
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:30,605
The Lord has spoken unto me, Isaac,
and I must obey him.

609
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:34,009
If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff,
would you do it?

610
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:36,276
- Forgive me, Isaac.
- My God.

611
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,884
Stop! What are you doing
with that kid?

612
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,946
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

613
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:45,888
This is my son, sir.
We were playing a game.

614
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,053
All right?
It's called Burny Burny Cut Cut.

615
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:52,428
You weren't.
You were gonna kill him.

616
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,297
I was not going to kill him.
I was going to sacrifice him.

617
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,904
- There is a tremendous difference.
- Not to him.

618
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:04,705
By what right dost thou interfere?
Art thou sent by the Lord?

619
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,610
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

620
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:12,116
- Aye. Aye, verily, thou art.
- Verily. Yea.

621
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:16,382
Thou were sent by the Eternal One
to stay my hand.

622
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,220
- All of that.
- This is Isaac.

623
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:24,763
And I am Abraham, the son of Terah
of the House of Nahor.

624
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:29,426
We were two doors down from Nahor.
We were Nahor's neighbors.

625
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:31,400
And I am Zed, son of Zero.

626
00:40:31,572 --> 00:40:35,770
And this is Oh, son of Ooh
from the House of Sticks and Dung.

627
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:38,309
The tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond.

628
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,107
Come. Come, my friends.

629
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,877
We are the Hebrews.

630
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,781
A righteous people,
but not very good at sports.

631
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:48,478
This way, friends. Come.

632
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:51,254
Brothers, brothers.

633
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,817
Let us give thanks
unto the Lord thy God...

634
00:40:55,996 --> 00:41:00,023
...for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day.

635
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:03,227
Praise be to God,
hallowed be his name.

636
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:04,803
And let us also praise him...

637
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:08,169
...for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us.

638
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:09,832
He hath increased our wealth...

639
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,500
...and blessed us with...

640
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,773
Thanks. Thank you.
A lot of loving things.

641
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:16,314
- Kind loving kindness.
- Yeah.

642
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:18,452
Friends, whence comest thou?

643
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,887
- He wants to know where you're from.
- Thou comest not from...

644
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:25,924
...the Cities of the Plain,
from Sodom and Gomorrah.

645
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:28,357
- Heard of them, never been there.
- Are they nice?

646
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:29,723
"Are they nice?"

647
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:32,661
They have been cursed for all time
by the Lord thy God...

648
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,233
...for their abominations.
- I did not know that.

649
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:38,633
They worship idols
and they bow down before false gods.

650
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:40,671
- Abdominal.
- It's the worst.

651
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:43,810
The men of that city
are weak and soft...

652
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:47,209
...fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink.

653
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:49,576
I'm not hearing the bad part.

654
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,075
The women are whores.

655
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:54,687
Their shameless lust
knows no bounds.

656
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:56,083
They flaunt their flesh...

657
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:59,658
...and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth.

658
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,660
Which one of the two cities
has the most whores?

659
00:42:03,664 --> 00:42:07,259
Just so we know to stay away
from that one especially.

660
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:10,665
Walk you not the path of Sodom.

661
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:13,238
For the Lord thy God
has said unto me...

662
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,308
...that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city...

663
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:19,378
...and all who dwell within
for their iniquity.

664
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:22,443
He shall smite them.

665
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:26,382
Them, and all of their seed.

666
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:30,422
So when do you think
this smiting's gonna go down?

667
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,287
- Because we have some friends there.
- Their fate is sealed.

668
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:36,555
But for my faith and devotion...

669
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:37,921
...that self-same God...

670
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:41,861
...has promised unto me
the whole of this land.

671
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:46,393
From the Heights of Golan in the north
to the Sinai in the south.

672
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,630
From the river of Jordan
to the great sea.

673
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:52,833
- This is all your land?
- For all of eternity.

674
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,342
But apparently God
forgot to tell anyone else.

675
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:57,412
We're at war with someone
every other day.

676
00:42:57,581 --> 00:43:00,675
Excuse me. I and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies...

677
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:03,479
...by the mighty hand
of God, blessed be he.

678
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:05,815
- Praised is his name...
- Unto us.

679
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:08,355
...and glory his graciousness.
- Wealthy bounty.

680
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:12,518
Therefore, to signify my covenant
with the one true God...

681
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:17,360
...I shall on this day
circumcise the flesh of my penis.

682
00:43:17,534 --> 00:43:22,995
And of you. And you, and of you,
and every male who dwelleth hereby.

683
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:26,232
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what you mean.

684
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,504
We shall grasp the foreskins
of our penises...

685
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,116
...and we shall cut therefrom
the extra flesh. Amen.

686
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:37,783
I don't think I have any extra.

687
00:43:37,955 --> 00:43:40,549
- Couldn't we pierce our ears?
- No, no, no.

688
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:43,124
So it shall be written,
and so it shall be done.

689
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:46,922
Let me get this straight. You're saying
you have too much cock?

690
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:48,564
And you wanna:

691
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:53,901
You know, Abe, it's been a long day,
we've all had a lot to drink...

692
00:43:54,071 --> 00:43:57,598
...and I know that this foreskin thing
sounds like a good idea now...

693
00:43:57,775 --> 00:43:59,834
...but you might wanna sleep on it.

694
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,841
We can always cut it off
in the morning.

695
00:44:02,012 --> 00:44:05,209
But if we do it now, there's just no way
to get it back on there.

696
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:08,283
No, no, no, trust me, it's gonna be
a very, very sleek look.

697
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:12,684
This is gonna catch on. I'm gonna go
get my good knife.

698
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:18,356
Just wait right there. I'll be right back
to cut your penises.

699
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:22,927
Not the whole thing,
you understand. Just the very tip.

700
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,297
And after, we're all gonna have wine
and sponge cake.

701
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,739
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

702
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:33,001
Going to Sodom.
We have to save Maya and Eema.

703
00:44:33,177 --> 00:44:35,737
He said that God
was gonna smite Sodom with holy fire.

704
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:38,177
God also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick.

705
00:44:38,348 --> 00:44:43,786
Dad, no! No! No!

706
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:48,213
So listen, I've been thinking,
what constitutes the tip of the penis?

707
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:51,190
Because his definition
might not be the same as mine.

708
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:54,922
- What if the tip is your favorite part?
- The tip is your only part.

709
00:44:58,836 --> 00:45:00,633
Come out here.

710
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:04,365
Hey, you caught me. Guilty.

711
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:05,633
What are you doing here?

712
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:08,141
- I'm gonna come.
- You don't know where we're going.

713
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:09,904
- You're going to Sodom, right?
- No.

714
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,776
How stupid you think I am?
You've had a boner for Sodom...

715
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:15,817
...since my dad mentioned it.
If I take you, get me some wine.

716
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:17,453
Aren't you a bit young?

717
00:45:17,621 --> 00:45:20,055
Do you like hanging out
with this little girl?

718
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:23,292
My dad just trimmed my dick skin.

719
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:28,289
That's Sodom right there.
The Unholy Land.

720
00:45:28,465 --> 00:45:32,492
The devil's playground,
where the sinners are winners.

721
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:36,362
Me and my boys sneak in here
on the weekends sometimes.

722
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,168
Pick up on the babes,
drink some wine, smoke some herb.

723
00:45:39,343 --> 00:45:41,777
- Shouldn't be smoking either.
- Thanks a lot, Grandpa.

724
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:44,743
I've been smoking for four harvests
now, so I think I'm good.

725
00:45:47,618 --> 00:45:49,176
These doors are enormous.

726
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:52,951
- It looks like they're not open, so...
- You just gotta knock.

727
00:45:53,123 --> 00:45:55,091
- They let me in all the time.
- Yeah, knock.

728
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:56,726
- Why don't you knock?
- You knock.

729
00:45:56,894 --> 00:45:59,886
- What if we're waking somebody?
- Eema and Maya might be in there.

730
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:01,792
I gave them our word
we'd rescue them.

731
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:04,593
I want to get my dicky sticky.

732
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:09,636
- Halt. Halt.
- Get help. Tell your father.

733
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:12,570
Like I'm gonna tell my father
I came with you guys to Sodom.

734
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:13,971
So long, suckers.

735
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:16,544
I kind of get why his dad
wanted to kill him.

736
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:20,643
Get in.

737
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:25,280
- What's this, then?
- They were banging on the gate.

738
00:46:25,455 --> 00:46:29,323
- Hebrews from the look of them.
- Well, we're not really Hebrews.

739
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,790
We are Hebrews?

740
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:35,090
I get it. No talking.

741
00:46:35,265 --> 00:46:37,324
- Should we wake the commander?
- Oh, no.

742
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:41,699
Don't want to wake the commander.
He gets mean when you wake him.

743
00:46:41,872 --> 00:46:43,840
Meaner than this?

744
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:49,770
Let go of his titty.

745
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:52,846
Yeah. Okay. All right, good one.

746
00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:57,248
What the bloody hell
is going on out there?

747
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:04,886
Who screamed?
Sounded like a woman.

748
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:09,188
But you don't look like a woman.
You wanna kiss me?

749
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:11,493
Like in a romantic way?

750
00:47:13,103 --> 00:47:15,697
By tomorrow morning,
you'll wish you hadn't been born.

751
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,806
- I already feel that way right now.
- Yeah.

752
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,966
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

753
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:24,580
Because that I would pay to see.
You versus a guy your size.

754
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,515
Give me my stick.

755
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:35,087
Bumpy. You got a smoother one?

756
00:47:35,892 --> 00:47:37,086
Yeah.

757
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,728
Turn around
and put your hands on the table.

758
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,257
Now!

759
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:45,059
I'll take that kiss now.

760
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:49,372
- We'll start with the fat one.
- Relatively fat. I mean...

761
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:53,100
- Welcome to Sodom.
- Hey, I want a piece of that.

762
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,146
- Cain?
- You know them?

763
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:00,382
Brothers.

764
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:07,487
I missed you so much. Oh, you guys.
Promise you'll never leave me again.

765
00:48:11,061 --> 00:48:13,188
- This is amazing.
- And this is a Monday.

766
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:15,194
You should see this place
on a Thursday.

767
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:18,596
- Because Thursday's the new Friday.
- Well, thanks for saving us.

768
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:22,569
- What are you gonna do to us now?
- Excuse me? Do I detect a tone here?

769
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:24,769
You did sell us into slavery.

770
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,138
Hold a grudge much?
That was, like, a fortnight ago.

771
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:30,438
It was less than a fortnight.
Half a fortnight.

772
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:33,708
- It was a sevennight.
- Oh, give me a break.

773
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:35,613
I was dealing with the death...

774
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:39,119
...of a close, personal family member
and I needed some space.

775
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:43,316
But hey, now I realize that you guys
are like my real brothers.

776
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:48,021
And it's so rare to have a brother
that you love and don't wanna kill.

777
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:50,093
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

778
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:51,700
Hey, who's hungry?

779
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,130
- I'm hungry.
- Don't kill me.

780
00:48:53,303 --> 00:48:54,930
Yeah? Okay.

781
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:58,005
Excuse me, I was...

782
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:02,077
Yeah, that's two for flinching.
Hey, let's go.

783
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:06,978
Here. Now we're even.

784
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:11,653
Check out the woman across the way.
She's looking at us.

785
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:15,622
She's totally eye-knowing us
with her eyes right now.

786
00:49:38,248 --> 00:49:40,580
Well, she's really making
that banana last.

787
00:49:43,386 --> 00:49:46,014
- Go talk to her.
- I kind of have a girlfriend right now.

788
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:49,249
A girl that I'm going to marry.

789
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:53,089
Make my wife, make her my girlfriend
one day when I get enough strength.

790
00:49:53,263 --> 00:49:56,721
What transpires within the confines
of the walls of Sodom...

791
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,835
...stays within the confines of the walls
of Sodom.

792
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:04,537
If you guys are gonna stay here,
you should join the guard.

793
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:07,939
- Hey!
- Hey, hey what, hey? Huh? Yeah.

794
00:50:08,278 --> 00:50:11,281
I mean, the pay's not great
but the perks, tons of them.

795
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:15,047
I'm telling you, it's the only way to go.
Come on, let's go talk to the sergeant.

796
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:18,917
- Let's go.
- Hurry now.

797
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:27,196
This is great. How do I look?

798
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:31,125
I can't see. This is too big on me.
I wonder if I can get a smaller size.

799
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:35,362
Yeah, someone's gotta be
the hat person around here.

800
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:37,234
- Find a...
- Excuse me.

801
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:40,604
Hey, my helmet is way too big
for me. It looks really silly.

802
00:50:40,777 --> 00:50:43,610
- Think I can get a smaller one?
- Line up!

803
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:50,279
- What are you doing? In the line.
- Wait, he's not...

804
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:53,082
In the line. Face forward in the line.

805
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:55,417
- Guys. Guys?
- I don't know where to...

806
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,423
- Guys.
- You too!

807
00:50:58,061 --> 00:51:01,553
- Guys.
- Find a hole, you stupid bastards.

808
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,722
- It's kind of obvious, isn't it?
- Not to me.

809
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,334
Soldiers. Present arms.

810
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:13,935
I never got a sword.
I only got the holder.

811
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:17,446
I didn't know
that that's what it was for.

812
00:51:17,914 --> 00:51:20,974
- So this is it? We just walk around?
- Yeah, pretty much.

813
00:51:21,151 --> 00:51:22,448
Just look for troublemakers.

814
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:26,612
If you see a thief or a pickpocket,
we'll slap them around a little bit.

815
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,886
Maybe cut off a finger, you know,
or tip of the nose sometimes.

816
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:35,623
Lower lip. Just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion.

817
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:37,027
It seems kind of harsh.

818
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,933
Hey, just remember it's the palace
that pays us, not the people. Come on.

819
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:44,437
Feed us!

820
00:51:46,943 --> 00:51:52,347
Six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain.

821
00:51:52,515 --> 00:51:56,508
Majesty, there's talk of revolution
in the streets.

822
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:59,211
Oil and grain are scarce,
prices are high.

823
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:03,883
Starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food.

824
00:52:04,327 --> 00:52:06,921
We could actually have a riot
on our hands.

825
00:52:07,097 --> 00:52:10,328
Poverty has a bitter taste,
but it is a flavor they are born to.

826
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,698
It is the will of the gods.
What do the entrails predict?

827
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,176
Well, the liver is streaked with gray,
which is not a good sign...

828
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:25,781
...but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized...

829
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:28,884
...which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region.

830
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:30,849
The genitals are enormous.

831
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:33,353
That's of no significance,
I'm just commenting.

832
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:35,286
If you do look at this intestine...

833
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,892
...his large intestine
is arranged in an arc...

834
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:40,723
...then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes.

835
00:52:40,897 --> 00:52:43,559
To me, I see a happy face.
That makes me happy.

836
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:45,398
What does it mean?

837
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:50,403
Well, could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart.

838
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:52,905
Or that you're going
on a long sea voyage.

839
00:52:53,076 --> 00:52:54,907
Could I come?
I've never been on a boat.

840
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:57,512
How did you become high priest?

841
00:52:58,415 --> 00:52:59,814
I'm your brother-in-law.

842
00:52:59,983 --> 00:53:02,417
Perhaps it's time
for a new high priest.

843
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:12,224
Perhaps it's not time
for a new high priest.

844
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:24,330
Let that be a warning to you.

845
00:53:24,507 --> 00:53:29,171
Next time, I shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face.

846
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:31,109
Or a fireball.

847
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:34,939
And you know what's the best part
about Sodom? The sodomy.

848
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:37,052
You guys are in for a treat.

849
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:57,664
Down.

850
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:00,002
Did you see that girl?

851
00:54:00,377 --> 00:54:01,776
That was Princess Inanna.

852
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:04,573
She's totally hot.
Don't even think about it.

853
00:54:04,948 --> 00:54:05,972
Why not?

854
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:09,016
Why? Because she's royalty
and you're a caveman.

855
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:10,482
Where's everybody going?

856
00:54:10,653 --> 00:54:12,814
To the temple.
You guys have to see this.

857
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:15,287
- Will she be there?
- Yeah, everyone'll be there.

858
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:28,366
There she is.

859
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:40,505
The princess isn't eating.

860
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:43,243
I find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry.

861
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,617
- You can't keep starving yourself.
- Why not?

862
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,782
Everybody else is starving.
Present company excluded.

863
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:51,551
Careful, princess.

864
00:54:51,728 --> 00:54:55,095
You may be my stepdaughter,
but these are dangerous times...

865
00:54:55,265 --> 00:54:58,792
...and those are dangerous words.
- Whatever.

866
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:00,935
Hi.

867
00:55:02,138 --> 00:55:03,628
Yeah.

868
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:16,211
- What's happening?
- They're picking a virgin.

869
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,248
Oh, please. If you're a virgin,
then I'm a fuzzy little gerbil.

870
00:55:24,427 --> 00:55:27,828
Back to the whorehouse with you.
Quick as a bunny. There you go.

871
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:29,464
What do they need a virgin for?

872
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:32,897
- To throw her in the fire. Are you new?
- What? Why?

873
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,065
An offering to the gods.

874
00:55:36,506 --> 00:55:38,838
- Are you serious?
- There's a famine going on...

875
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:41,442
...so if we make
a good enough sacrifice...

876
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:45,012
...then the gods give us rain.
You get rain, you get harvest...

877
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:47,843
...you get harvest, you get food.
You know what food is?

878
00:55:48,017 --> 00:55:50,485
Yeah, you know food.

879
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:53,622
So they're gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains?

880
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:57,851
Where do you think rain
comes from? Clouds?

881
00:55:58,027 --> 00:55:59,517
My 6-year-old knows.

882
00:55:59,696 --> 00:56:03,655
- Hey, how do you get rain?
- Burn a virgin.

883
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:07,359
I didn't think
it was anything related to...

884
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:09,732
Yeah, yeah. "I didn't think,
I didn't think."

885
00:56:09,906 --> 00:56:12,670
It's the gods and it comes
from virgins being burned.

886
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:14,738
Did I do something to offend you?

887
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:18,312
I come here, I get a great seat
at the sacrifice, and you're ruining it.

888
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,278
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me.

889
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:26,820
Hey, guys? I'm trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family.

890
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,015
Do you mind? Do you mind?

891
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:30,454
For the love of the gods...

892
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:33,323
...we commit this fair maiden...

893
00:56:33,997 --> 00:56:37,228
...to Moloch's holy fire.

894
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:44,771
These virgins, it's always a girl?

895
00:56:44,941 --> 00:56:48,172
I'm really happy for her.
She was always the runner-up.

896
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:49,368
True success story.

897
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:52,640
My lord,
the princess wishes to see you.

898
00:56:52,815 --> 00:56:54,680
Me? What about my friend?

899
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:56,546
Can the two of us come?
We're a pair.

900
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,552
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The three of us are like a pair.

901
00:56:59,722 --> 00:57:03,180
No, not you.
The two of you, follow me.

902
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,951
Great.

903
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:08,697
- I'll try to put a good word in for you.
- Yeah, do.

904
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:12,631
If we never, ever see you again,
it's not because we're avoiding you.

905
00:57:13,036 --> 00:57:14,560
Don't forget about me.

906
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:21,508
This is Zaftig, the eunuch.
You, go with him.

907
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:23,578
Oh, can't I go with him?

908
00:57:23,746 --> 00:57:28,410
- Why? Is he your lover?
- No, we're just friends.

909
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:29,882
That would be weird.
We're both guys.

910
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,810
- Come with me.
- What do you do?

911
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,545
I've been a palace eunuch
since I was 9 years old.

912
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:40,417
- How would I become a eunuch?
- They cut off your testicles.

913
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,353
Why all the genital mutilation?

914
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,791
Well, you get to keep them.
I always keep mine close at hand.

915
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,760
Would you like to see?

916
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,263
No.

917
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,904
Can I ask your opinion?

918
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:05,343
What do you think?
Ponytail or no ponytail?

919
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:09,576
- I don't know and I really don't care.
- Okay. I just wanted to know...

920
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:13,245
...what the ladies of Sodom
were into nowadays, but...

921
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,925
This party is insane.

922
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,060
It's more of a hair-down
kind of scene, I'd say.

923
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,229
Hi.

924
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,934
Be sure to try the fruit.

925
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,982
Maya. What are you doing here?

926
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,917
Okay, I'm still alive,
thank you for asking...

927
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,781
...and I'm still a slave.

928
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:48,151
I was coming to rescue you. Really.
That's why we were here.

929
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:49,724
- We were gonna find you.
- Yeah?

930
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,726
You seemed worried
about your ponytail just a second ago.

931
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:54,992
I was just...

932
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,565
- You were just chosen again.
- I was.

933
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,328
I would love to join you at this orgy,
but I can't...

934
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:05,133
...because I have to go be a slave,
and I don't get any breaks.

935
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,069
And the princess has crabs.

936
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:16,778
Oh, yes, it's steamy.

937
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,914
God, that's realistic.

938
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:21,920
Watch it, jerk.

939
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,685
A real woman, that's...

940
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,829
Oh, excuse me, Miss...

941
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:31,524
Ter. Mister. Awkward.

942
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,534
Good concentration.

943
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,598
You're good. You're real good.

944
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,275
- Oh? Is that you?
- I'm not supposed to talk, I'm a statue.

945
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:52,513
- Yeah, you look so gold.
- It's all the gold paint.

946
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,623
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

947
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:58,818
I just had my entire body
painted by a fat guy with no balls.

948
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,123
- Oh, how did that go?
- He was extremely thorough.

949
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,500
- How's it going with you?
- Not bad.

950
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,659
Just had a little rub and scrub.
Now I'm up for some grub.

951
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,395
- Sounds luxurious.
- Hey.

952
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:13,201
You remember that woman
who brought us in with the face dress?

953
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,868
That was Maya. She's working here
now and she looks great.

954
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,412
- Kind of mad at me, though.
- And there's Eema.

955
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:21,581
Come here, wench.

956
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,582
Let me have a look
what's up that skirt.

957
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,954
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
- It was no accident.

958
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:34,188
Hey. You. Slave girl.
I told you to fetch me more wine.

959
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,925
- Apologize to this officer now.
- I'm sorry.

960
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:42,060
Good. Now go fetch.
Wait over there by the skinny statue.

961
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:45,105
I'll deal with you later. Go!

962
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,207
Slaves. What are you gonna do?

963
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,175
Wait a minute.

964
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,613
Don't I know you?

965
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,199
- What are you, crazy?
- I will not serve these people.

966
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,892
- I'd rather die.
- Keep it up. You will.

967
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,298
Have you joined them?

968
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:17,736
I haven't joined anything.
I'm not having fun.

969
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,375
I'm just checking it out.
A lot to learn here.

970
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:24,536
- What, human sacrifice?
- No. No human sacrifices.

971
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,807
I've been chosen
to do something great.

972
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,245
Yeah, here we go.

973
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:32,946
I'm pretty sure it's not hunting pigs
and weaving baskets.

974
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,220
- Oh?
- Hello, Maya.

975
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,428
She wants to see you. Now.

976
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,122
Don't think
I'm interested in her.

977
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,665
- Whyever would I think that?
- It's part of my plan.

978
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,803
I'm gonna get us out of here
soon as I can.

979
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:51,134
- The princess awaits you.
- And I await her.

980
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:55,908
You two, await me.
Stay out of trouble. Stay gold.

981
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,104
He has no idea what he's doing,
does he?

982
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:02,183
- It's nice to see you like this.
- It's nice to see you too.

983
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:04,616
We should do something.
When do you get off?

984
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:09,121
- Never. I'm a slave.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

985
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,760
Slave girl, bring me a towel.

986
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,593
Yeah, I should go be a slave.

987
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,232
I'm gonna strike a specific pose,
I guess.

988
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,198
- Okay.
- I love you.

989
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:31,270
You there. Golden boy.
Come here.

990
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,456
Rub me with oil.

991
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,752
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
That's not...

992
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,192
I'm not one of the oil rubbers,
I'm just a guard.

993
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,160
Rub me with oil or die.

994
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:02,538
- Is that enough?
- Much more. Baste me like a chicken.

995
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:07,380
Oh, yes. Pour it all over me,
you little bronze bitchlet.

996
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:10,315
Yeah, okay. You got the whole thing
on you now.

997
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,953
Marvelous, I love it.

998
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,579
All right, well, have a good evening.
I'm glad I could help you out.

999
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,919
Now rub it in.

1000
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:20,893
With my hand?

1001
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:24,556
No. With your nutsack.
Of course, with your hand.

1002
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:30,830
Oh, yes.

1003
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,770
Oh, yes, the oily oiliness.

1004
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,207
The musky, precious,
smoky, oily oiliness.

1005
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:39,507
Yes, that's right.
Oh, God, paint a picture on my body.

1006
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,479
- Tell a story on my nipples.
- Yeah.

1007
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,279
That's right, take me down
the smoky Euphrates.

1008
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:46,752
Do something
you'll be ashamed of later...

1009
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,448
...you naughty little goat.
All right, charm the snake.

1010
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:51,924
- Eema. Hey...
- Oh, just like that. Now slap me.

1011
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:55,051
- This isn't what it looks like.
- My tummy. Go ahead, slap me.

1012
01:03:55,228 --> 01:03:58,493
- Slap me. Slap the tummy.
- No, it's fine. I mean, I understand.

1013
01:03:58,664 --> 01:04:01,895
Go on. I love it, I love it.
Oh, you're very gifted.

1014
01:04:02,068 --> 01:04:05,333
No, no, no. I'm just rubbing oil
on this man's chest. Eema.

1015
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:08,770
A gift. I don't know,
you've got some sort of gift.

1016
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,313
- Good luck.
- Look, Maya. Maya.

1017
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,053
Come to me.

1018
01:04:26,392 --> 01:04:27,484
Beautiful, isn't it?

1019
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,026
You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill.

1020
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:33,222
Yep. Twin cities.

1021
01:04:33,433 --> 01:04:35,867
People think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out...

1022
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:39,334
...because they're so evil.
- And what do you think? Am I evil?

1023
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:43,441
Well, I don't really know you,
but you don't look evil.

1024
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:45,372
Do you find me attractive?

1025
01:04:47,914 --> 01:04:49,108
Yeah.

1026
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:50,613
Let me ask you one thing.

1027
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:53,308
What would a girl like you
want with a guy like me?

1028
01:04:54,053 --> 01:04:58,990
I don't know.
I just find you interesting.

1029
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,354
They say it's the will of the gods...

1030
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:04,052
...that some men should suffer
while others rule.

1031
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,721
That we're all just victims
of our own fate.

1032
01:05:06,899 --> 01:05:08,628
I believed that until this morning...

1033
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:12,464
...when I saw you standing up alone
in the square and I said to myself:

1034
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:17,439
"Yes! Finally, here's one man
who refuses to bow down to anything.

1035
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,477
A man with the courage
to question the order of things.

1036
01:05:20,646 --> 01:05:25,982
A man chosen by the gods
to do something great."

1037
01:05:26,152 --> 01:05:27,983
That's exactly
what I've been thinking.

1038
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:30,384
You would not believe the stuff
happening to me.

1039
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:33,116
- I just didn't know why.
- I know why.

1040
01:05:33,292 --> 01:05:38,559
To bring you here. To this place.
To me.

1041
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:41,632
I could not agree more.

1042
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:45,335
I'm trying to agree more, but I can't,
because that's how much I agree.

1043
01:05:46,305 --> 01:05:47,897
Come.

1044
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:52,770
This must be difficult
for you to understand...

1045
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:55,675
...but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods...

1046
01:05:55,848 --> 01:05:58,976
...and the good of the people.
I keep nothing for myself.

1047
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:04,422
- That's very unselfish of you.
- It is unselfish of me, isn't it?

1048
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,683
You're so perceptive
for one so young.

1049
01:06:07,293 --> 01:06:10,854
- Yeah. What are those doors there?
- Behind these doors...

1050
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,966
...is the Holy of Holies,
earthly domain of the gods.

1051
01:06:15,134 --> 01:06:17,329
A place so ineffably sacred,
so powerful...

1052
01:06:17,503 --> 01:06:19,698
...that to enter is instant death.

1053
01:06:20,773 --> 01:06:23,367
- Who cleans it?
- Needs no cleaning.

1054
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:26,068
Kind of makes you think
about the people that built it.

1055
01:06:26,245 --> 01:06:27,974
Like, did they die instantly...

1056
01:06:28,147 --> 01:06:30,047
...or were they given
a courtesy second...

1057
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:32,047
...to get out of there by the gods?

1058
01:06:32,218 --> 01:06:34,914
They were allowed to finish,
given four and a half seconds...

1059
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:37,078
...then the gods descended.

1060
01:06:38,391 --> 01:06:41,053
- What if a bug goes in there?
- Instant death for the bug.

1061
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:44,128
Are there dead bugs all over?
Because nobody cleans it.

1062
01:06:44,297 --> 01:06:46,265
They're vaporized immediately...

1063
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:50,698
...by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor.

1064
01:06:51,337 --> 01:06:53,771
- Can we go in?
- I just told you.

1065
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,569
To enter is instant death,
you gorgeous little dunce.

1066
01:06:57,944 --> 01:06:59,275
Can't even poke our heads in?

1067
01:06:59,445 --> 01:07:01,379
You're so young and curious,
aren't you?

1068
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:04,914
You want to know it all
and taste it all, explore it all, be it all...

1069
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:08,019
...dance with it all, suck it all,
don't you?

1070
01:07:08,754 --> 01:07:10,517
I've got a riddle for you.

1071
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,419
What has two thumbs...

1072
01:07:12,592 --> 01:07:14,753
...and is desperate
for another hot-oil rub?

1073
01:07:15,528 --> 01:07:17,894
- What?
- This person.

1074
01:07:18,064 --> 01:07:20,259
Come on. Let's go.

1075
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:25,395
- Come. Come quick.
- That will not be a problem.

1076
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,931
What are we doing here?

1077
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:33,111
I want you to enter
the Holy of Holies.

1078
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:35,179
Oh, that is quite a coincidence...

1079
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:38,340
...because I want you to sit
on the Poley of Poleys.

1080
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:43,678
- Oh, no. That's the Holy of Holies.
- I thought you were talking about...

1081
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:47,087
You have to go in there
and speak to the gods.

1082
01:07:47,259 --> 01:07:49,727
- The gods are in there?
- So they say.

1083
01:07:49,895 --> 01:07:52,295
The only one who goes in there
is the high priest.

1084
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:55,195
They say it's instant death
for anyone else to enter.

1085
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:59,634
- Then why am I going in?
- Because you've been chosen.

1086
01:07:59,805 --> 01:08:02,672
If the gods wanted you dead,
they would've killed you already.

1087
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:05,709
- Right.
- This is what you've been chosen for.

1088
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:08,244
To speak to the gods,
divine their purpose...

1089
01:08:08,414 --> 01:08:11,713
...and plead with them
to end this terrible famine.

1090
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:14,318
Then come back out
and tell me what it's like inside.

1091
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:15,511
- Okay.
- Okay.

1092
01:08:15,688 --> 01:08:17,053
Right.

1093
01:08:23,596 --> 01:08:26,258
I'm pretty sure I'm chosen,
but I'm not "sure" sure.

1094
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:28,064
You're chosen.

1095
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:31,567
Okay. I'm gonna go in,
but you gotta do something for me.

1096
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:34,729
- You gotta let my friends go.
- Anything.

1097
01:08:45,418 --> 01:08:50,947
Don't kill me, don't kill me,
don't kill me...

1098
01:08:51,123 --> 01:08:53,614
Get up. You look ridiculous.

1099
01:08:56,062 --> 01:09:00,055
- Oh? What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from the high priest.

1100
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:02,427
I spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him.

1101
01:09:03,636 --> 01:09:05,228
Is that chest hair?

1102
01:09:05,404 --> 01:09:07,634
Not all of it. Just don't ask, okay?

1103
01:09:08,641 --> 01:09:10,871
I've lost my sense
of right and wrong.

1104
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:13,568
How did you get in here
without getting fried?

1105
01:09:13,746 --> 01:09:15,179
- I don't know. How did you?
- Because I'm a chosen.

1106
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:19,510
Probably why God didn't kill you:
He knew you were my follower.

1107
01:09:19,682 --> 01:09:22,412
- I'm not your follower.
- Why are you always following me?

1108
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:26,112
I'm not following you. I walk
behind you at the same pace as you.

1109
01:09:26,289 --> 01:09:28,519
Not following.
I could be leading from the rear.

1110
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:31,888
Come on. I'm the leader.
I always have been.

1111
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:34,188
Some leader.
Told us you were gonna get us out.

1112
01:09:34,364 --> 01:09:37,527
- Just been messing around at orgies.
- Messing around at orgies?

1113
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,997
No, no. I'm not like you.

1114
01:09:39,168 --> 01:09:41,830
I don't get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun.

1115
01:09:42,005 --> 01:09:45,168
- I have no downtime.
- Please. Your whole life is downtime.

1116
01:09:45,341 --> 01:09:47,741
That's what you think?
That's what everybody thinks.

1117
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,902
I'm about to show you something.
Observe.

1118
01:09:56,119 --> 01:10:00,385
Almighty God, or gods,
whatever the case may be...

1119
01:10:00,723 --> 01:10:02,884
...I need to ask a favor of you.

1120
01:10:03,059 --> 01:10:04,788
I know
I've really messed things up...

1121
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:09,459
...but I really need to come through
on this one...

1122
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:13,758
...and I wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends.

1123
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:17,703
- And that's it, that's the favor.
- Oh, shit.

1124
01:10:19,342 --> 01:10:22,641
And also,
if you could just make it rain...

1125
01:10:22,812 --> 01:10:27,579
...or like drizzle without us having
to kill a virgin, you know what I mean?

1126
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:31,049
Because we need our virgins
at the moment.

1127
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,414
And also, if you could give me
the power...

1128
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:37,320
...to see through women's clothing
without them knowing...

1129
01:10:37,493 --> 01:10:39,484
...that would be really great.

1130
01:10:41,397 --> 01:10:42,421
Hello?

1131
01:10:42,598 --> 01:10:44,998
Hasn't it occurred to you
that it might be silent...

1132
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:48,831
...because God is not in here?
Look around. There's nothing in here.

1133
01:10:49,005 --> 01:10:51,633
That doesn't prove anything.
Maybe he stepped away.

1134
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:53,673
- For what?
- God stuff.

1135
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:56,277
If he needs something,
he can create it from nothing.

1136
01:10:56,446 --> 01:10:59,244
What's the point of being God
if you keep running for things?

1137
01:10:59,415 --> 01:11:03,408
Let me just put something out there.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

1138
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:08,120
What? So everything is just random?

1139
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:10,088
Then nothing would mean anything.

1140
01:11:10,259 --> 01:11:12,352
- What would be the point?
- That is the point.

1141
01:11:12,528 --> 01:11:14,428
That there's no point? That's stupid.

1142
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:15,689
- You're stupid.
- No.

1143
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:19,028
- There's something bigger than me.
- There's nothing bigger than you.

1144
01:11:19,202 --> 01:11:21,261
- Don't touch my belly to make a point.
- Fine.

1145
01:11:21,437 --> 01:11:24,998
- Okay. I'm sorry, I have a man's body.
- I'm maturing at my own pace.

1146
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:28,635
- You are so jealous of me.
- Jealous? That you're a bullshit artist?

1147
01:11:28,811 --> 01:11:31,871
That every time you speak,
it's bullshit coming out of your mouth?

1148
01:11:32,048 --> 01:11:35,211
You would believe in God
if you've ever been with a woman.

1149
01:11:35,384 --> 01:11:37,818
- I'm a virgin by choice.
- Not your choice.

1150
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:39,748
- Take that back.
- I won't.

1151
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:42,254
- Take back what you said.
- Take back what you said.

1152
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:43,790
Everything you've ever said.

1153
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,224
Don't stand close.
Get your belly off of my belly.

1154
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:47,623
Don't touch my belly.

1155
01:11:47,797 --> 01:11:50,061
I don't want to touch bellies with you,
ever.

1156
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:51,996
Take everything
you've ever said back.

1157
01:11:52,168 --> 01:11:54,136
- You're out of control.
- You're a freak.

1158
01:11:54,303 --> 01:11:57,830
- Stop screaming, stop screaming.
- You're a freak! Get off me.

1159
01:12:01,477 --> 01:12:05,038
I can pull this thing together.
The princess is right out there.

1160
01:12:05,214 --> 01:12:06,647
And if I play this right...

1161
01:12:06,816 --> 01:12:09,910
...l'm gonna get us all out of here,
Maya and Eema too.

1162
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:12,247
Just trust in me. Have a little faith.

1163
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:16,084
Fine, but not for you. For Eema.
And I'm too tired to argue right now.

1164
01:12:16,259 --> 01:12:19,751
I had a long hot bath with the
high priest, and I'm lightheaded.

1165
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:22,363
I'm sorry for squeezing you so hard.

1166
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:25,527
Let's go. Freak.

1167
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:32,403
God, if you do exist,
if you make Eema love me...

1168
01:12:32,742 --> 01:12:35,905
...I would be very grateful. Okay?

1169
01:12:36,646 --> 01:12:38,477
If you do exist.

1170
01:12:42,685 --> 01:12:44,175
You guys waiting to go in there?

1171
01:12:44,353 --> 01:12:46,480
Because I gotta say:
Not that big a deal.

1172
01:12:46,656 --> 01:12:49,420
If you see a broken penis,
it was like that when we went in.

1173
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:50,616
Seize him.

1174
01:12:52,094 --> 01:12:53,755
I'm seized.

1175
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,029
I wish I was upside down.

1176
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:06,934
Looks kind of fun.

1177
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,978
Is it fun?

1178
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:14,474
So you're not talking to me?

1179
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:17,210
We're not friends anymore,
after all I've done for you?

1180
01:13:17,386 --> 01:13:20,219
- What have you done for me?
- I brought you out of your shell.

1181
01:13:20,389 --> 01:13:23,722
Yeah? I liked my shell.
I liked the village.

1182
01:13:23,893 --> 01:13:27,351
Because of you, I'm in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers...

1183
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,294
...and they burn women
and they make people slaves.

1184
01:13:30,466 --> 01:13:32,434
People cut off
the ends of their penises...

1185
01:13:32,602 --> 01:13:35,537
...and their testicles and I'm
never gonna see Eema again...

1186
01:13:35,705 --> 01:13:37,229
...and it's because of you.

1187
01:13:37,406 --> 01:13:40,933
Please forgive me.
I mean, you are my best friend.

1188
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:43,340
I hate the world! I hate you!

1189
01:13:43,512 --> 01:13:47,346
And now I'm hanging upside down
and I really have to pee.

1190
01:13:47,516 --> 01:13:48,983
I know I'm not perfect.

1191
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:53,417
And maybe I made a few wrong turns,
but you gotta understand I'm chosen.

1192
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:56,285
That's a lot of responsibility.
You can't even imagine.

1193
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:59,951
The only one that thinks that you're
chosen is you. So shut up already!

1194
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:04,293
I'm gonna get us out of this thing
if it's the last thing I do.

1195
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:20,208
That was just my first idea.

1196
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:22,117
I'm also accepting ideas.

1197
01:14:22,285 --> 01:14:26,153
Guard!
The upside down prisoner has to pee!

1198
01:14:26,756 --> 01:14:29,316
Oh, I'm peeing.

1199
01:14:32,361 --> 01:14:33,385
Oh, no.

1200
01:14:33,562 --> 01:14:35,120
Try to keep your mouth closed.

1201
01:14:39,568 --> 01:14:41,229
Oh, no. In the nose.

1202
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:50,037
Hey, I'm peeing on my face too,
on the inside.

1203
01:14:50,212 --> 01:14:51,907
I hate you.

1204
01:15:01,924 --> 01:15:03,414
Observe, my dear...

1205
01:15:03,592 --> 01:15:06,220
...since it was you
who lured him to his death.

1206
01:15:07,797 --> 01:15:11,255
"For the crimes of blasphemy...

1207
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:14,033
...heresy...

1208
01:15:14,503 --> 01:15:16,232
...conspiracy..."

1209
01:15:16,405 --> 01:15:18,873
- What you thinking about?
- "Treachery...

1210
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:20,269
...leprosy..."

1211
01:15:20,443 --> 01:15:21,774
Trying to make conversation.

1212
01:15:21,944 --> 01:15:23,502
"Puppetry...

1213
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:27,308
...hyperbole..."
- Your hair looks really good today.

1214
01:15:27,483 --> 01:15:30,577
- I peed all over it.
- Then that's the secret, I guess.

1215
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:32,380
"Sodomy..."

1216
01:15:33,956 --> 01:15:37,790
- Oh, it's "refusal of sodomy."
- Yeah!

1217
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:40,285
Can you just forgive me?

1218
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:42,027
I think I hate you too much.

1219
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:45,395
"Lechery
and the murder of my brother, Abel."

1220
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:47,229
- Oh, come on!
- Shut it!

1221
01:15:48,037 --> 01:15:50,631
For these, and other crimes...

1222
01:15:50,806 --> 01:15:53,934
...the prisoners shall be stoned...

1223
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:55,543
...to death!

1224
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:01,414
- Wait! Can I make a suggestion?
- What?

1225
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:04,815
Just have one person throw stones
at us.

1226
01:16:04,987 --> 01:16:10,186
In fact, I think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us.

1227
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:13,817
No. That doesn't make any...

1228
01:16:14,663 --> 01:16:16,392
- We want that guy.
- That guy.

1229
01:16:16,565 --> 01:16:18,533
- Me?
- That's our stoner.

1230
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:21,761
What, just because I'm a eunuch
you don't think I can throw?

1231
01:16:21,937 --> 01:16:23,928
I'll show you throwing.

1232
01:16:24,106 --> 01:16:27,337
No, no. No, no, no! Gross.

1233
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:31,810
Did he just hurl his own ball at him?
How spectacular.

1234
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:34,472
No! That doesn't count.
That was a testicle.

1235
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:35,810
I think it counts.

1236
01:16:35,985 --> 01:16:38,317
- Pick somebody else.
- What is that idiot doing?

1237
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:41,320
- I pick that guy!
- Nice.

1238
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,151
- This guy?
- No, no, the shorter man.

1239
01:16:43,325 --> 01:16:45,259
Right in front of him.

1240
01:16:45,428 --> 01:16:46,952
It's a kid. This is a kid.

1241
01:16:47,129 --> 01:16:49,757
So? You got something against kids?
This guy hates kids.

1242
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:52,628
- Let me smite him!
- Kid hater!

1243
01:16:53,202 --> 01:16:56,103
- One shot!
- No, they're our future!

1244
01:16:56,272 --> 01:16:58,797
All right. Hey, go ahead and...

1245
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,868
Okay. I'm hit.

1246
01:17:03,345 --> 01:17:05,279
Holy shit, that kid's got an arm.

1247
01:17:05,448 --> 01:17:07,439
God. There's two of us.

1248
01:17:07,616 --> 01:17:08,674
Are you guys happy now?

1249
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:14,983
Okay! Everybody on this side,
on the count of three! One, two...

1250
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:18,149
Wait! I have a question for the king.

1251
01:17:20,196 --> 01:17:23,393
Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies?

1252
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,166
Yes! I entered the Holy of Holies
and, lo, I did not die.

1253
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,710
Why? Because I was chosen
by the gods!

1254
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:42,349
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>

1255
01:17:42,518 --> 01:17:46,750
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>

1256
01:17:46,922 --> 01:17:49,720
- Spare the chosen one!
- And his friend!

1257
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:53,089
- And his young friend.
- Don't kill either of them.

1258
01:17:53,262 --> 01:17:55,822
Everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one.

1259
01:17:55,998 --> 01:17:57,989
Is it possible? Is he truly chosen?

1260
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:01,330
Well, of course it's possible.
Highly doubtful.

1261
01:18:01,504 --> 01:18:03,734
Majesty, with respect...

1262
01:18:04,236 --> 01:18:07,637
...whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue.

1263
01:18:07,806 --> 01:18:10,639
If you were to kill him now,
given the public mood...

1264
01:18:10,809 --> 01:18:13,835
...it could inflame the situation
so as...

1265
01:18:14,013 --> 01:18:19,349
...to cause a radical regime change.

1266
01:18:20,186 --> 01:18:23,019
If you take my meaning.

1267
01:18:24,823 --> 01:18:26,757
Yes, that will do.

1268
01:18:31,664 --> 01:18:37,261
It is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved...

1269
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:43,864
...to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion!

1270
01:18:44,043 --> 01:18:45,067
Yes!

1271
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:47,269
And how is that better?

1272
01:18:58,424 --> 01:19:01,188
You seem to enjoy your work.
How long have you been a slave?

1273
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,590
Oh, I'm not a slave. I'm a volunteer.

1274
01:19:05,898 --> 01:19:09,561
Marlak. Enmebaragesi.
Long time no see.

1275
01:19:12,304 --> 01:19:13,396
I deserve that.

1276
01:19:13,572 --> 01:19:16,871
Take these bricks up top.
The masons are waiting.

1277
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:20,808
I would but I did something to my
neck. I think I slept on it funny.

1278
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:24,313
I should probably take it easy,
or I'll be no good for work tomorrow.

1279
01:19:24,483 --> 01:19:26,417
Move!

1280
01:19:26,585 --> 01:19:29,053
You know,
the mud's really good for your skin.

1281
01:19:29,722 --> 01:19:31,747
- Yeah.
- Ask me why my skin's so good.

1282
01:19:32,825 --> 01:19:34,224
- Why's your skin...?
- The mud.

1283
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:35,883
I knew you were gonna say that.

1284
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:42,830
You gotta love being outside.

1285
01:19:43,402 --> 01:19:45,336
Move it!

1286
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:47,895
Faster!

1287
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,873
- Want some water?
- You're from the village, aren't you?

1288
01:19:56,048 --> 01:19:58,312
I'll bet you wish you were back there
right now.

1289
01:19:58,717 --> 01:20:00,514
- Yeah.
- Don't give up.

1290
01:20:00,686 --> 01:20:02,313
You'll get home someday.

1291
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,150
Who's gonna take him there?
The chosen one?

1292
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:24,609
You two, up! Get on line. Now.

1293
01:20:24,777 --> 01:20:27,177
- Where are we going?
- To watch the sacrifice.

1294
01:20:27,346 --> 01:20:29,871
- The king demands it.
- Is it compulsory?

1295
01:20:30,049 --> 01:20:34,145
There was some work that I wanted to
finish doing, get a jump on tomorrow.

1296
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:37,649
I'd like to see how big you are
without that whip.

1297
01:20:39,191 --> 01:20:40,522
Same basic size.

1298
01:20:42,294 --> 01:20:43,989
All is in readiness, Your Majesty.

1299
01:20:44,163 --> 01:20:46,131
What now?
More virgins to sacrifice?

1300
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:51,962
Yes, two. Your own handmaiden
and another slave.

1301
01:20:52,137 --> 01:20:56,039
Followers of the chosen one.
Discovered by this loyal soldier.

1302
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:59,735
Oh, I was just doing my job.
It's what I do.

1303
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:05,578
And one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity.

1304
01:21:08,116 --> 01:21:11,119
For the love of the people,
and the heavenly gift of rain...

1305
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,350
...we offer a humble sacrifice:

1306
01:21:14,956 --> 01:21:17,424
our own stepdaughter...

1307
01:21:18,593 --> 01:21:20,322
...the Princess Inanna.

1308
01:21:23,298 --> 01:21:26,790
- You're insane.
- For the good of the people, darling.

1309
01:21:26,968 --> 01:21:28,799
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

1310
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,097
If you like,
I can arrange for you to join her.

1311
01:21:34,376 --> 01:21:35,570
Mother.

1312
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:38,372
How long did you think
I would tolerate your insolence?

1313
01:21:39,214 --> 01:21:41,114
Burn her.

1314
01:21:46,922 --> 01:21:50,380
Drink it. You won't feel a thing.

1315
01:21:56,331 --> 01:21:59,300
Are they booing me?
How dare they.

1316
01:21:59,468 --> 01:22:01,493
They love you.
They're wooing you.

1317
01:22:08,443 --> 01:22:10,877
That's fine. You know?

1318
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:26,721
It's Maya! And Eema!
Wait, Maya's a virgin?

1319
01:22:26,895 --> 01:22:27,919
No, don't kill them!

1320
01:22:28,096 --> 01:22:30,758
- Far enough, slave.
- No, kill me! I'm a male virgin.

1321
01:22:30,932 --> 01:22:33,332
Marlak, we can't let them
do this! Eema!

1322
01:22:33,502 --> 01:22:36,369
Eema. Eema!

1323
01:22:38,073 --> 01:22:41,008
- I gotta get down there.
- Over my dead body.

1324
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:45,112
- No problem.
- No. Hey! Hey! Hey!

1325
01:22:47,582 --> 01:22:51,382
- Thanks, Marlak.
- Now what?

1326
01:22:51,553 --> 01:22:55,717
We implore the great gods
to show us a sign...

1327
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:58,189
...so that we may honor
your divine will.

1328
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,193
Take this end. Lower me down.

1329
01:23:19,548 --> 01:23:21,072
Oh, dear.

1330
01:23:21,249 --> 01:23:22,876
Oh, no.

1331
01:23:57,285 --> 01:23:58,877
- What is it?
- It's a sign.

1332
01:23:59,054 --> 01:24:03,684
The chosen one comes! It's a sign!
He's going to end our suffering!

1333
01:24:03,858 --> 01:24:05,758
Fight the power! Yes, we can!

1334
01:24:12,267 --> 01:24:13,495
All together!

1335
01:24:16,871 --> 01:24:19,772
Let's cut some foreskins!

1336
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:24,671
I knew
I could depend upon your loyalty.

1337
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:28,674
Assholes.

1338
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:37,822
Burn them. Burn them now.
Burn them all!

1339
01:24:37,993 --> 01:24:40,188
Don't struggle,
it's the will of the gods.

1340
01:24:40,362 --> 01:24:41,522
I don't think so.

1341
01:24:41,696 --> 01:24:43,459
Zed!

1342
01:24:43,632 --> 01:24:45,361
Guards!

1343
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:48,235
- Sorry!
- Stupid.

1344
01:24:48,803 --> 01:24:52,671
Ma'am? Okay? All right?
Get the message?

1345
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:55,734
Okay, we should be safe in here.

1346
01:24:56,177 --> 01:24:57,906
Thank you.

1347
01:25:08,056 --> 01:25:10,354
So, Eema, this might be a bad time
to say this...

1348
01:25:10,525 --> 01:25:13,187
...but that stuff
that you saw the other night...

1349
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:15,591
...with the high priest, that...

1350
01:25:15,764 --> 01:25:19,029
He's a friend.
That was totally not a gay thing.

1351
01:25:28,043 --> 01:25:30,603
I always thought
that you and I had a connection.

1352
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:32,406
So I just wanted to mention it now.

1353
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,639
I always thought that we had
one and maybe...

1354
01:25:34,816 --> 01:25:36,909
...thought you might've
felt the same.

1355
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:40,282
I just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say.

1356
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,133
But I always thought... I always
have felt a certain way about you.

1357
01:25:55,303 --> 01:25:57,271
I don't know if you know or not
but you...

1358
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:00,966
All those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut...

1359
01:26:01,142 --> 01:26:02,871
...those were from me.

1360
01:26:03,044 --> 01:26:05,205
- Just kiss me.
- From me like a gift for you.

1361
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,712
I don't know,
I thought you'd like those.

1362
01:26:14,789 --> 01:26:17,485
I always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds...

1363
01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:18,853
...in a soup or something.

1364
01:26:19,027 --> 01:26:21,427
Or, I don't know,
I thought they were practical.

1365
01:26:28,036 --> 01:26:30,061
Should I take off my undercloth?

1366
01:26:34,075 --> 01:26:37,203
Oh, tough guy, huh?
You want a piece of me?

1367
01:26:37,379 --> 01:26:40,041
I'm gonna bash your head in.

1368
01:26:43,752 --> 01:26:46,084
That was a nice shot.

1369
01:26:50,425 --> 01:26:51,790
Hey.

1370
01:26:52,127 --> 01:26:53,151
Hey.

1371
01:27:01,302 --> 01:27:03,133
Zed!

1372
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:07,131
Get up and die like a man.

1373
01:27:07,575 --> 01:27:10,203
Nobody harm this woman.
She's not a virgin anymore.

1374
01:27:10,378 --> 01:27:13,814
- He's not either.
- I saved her life with my lovemaking.

1375
01:27:15,383 --> 01:27:18,011
Sit tight, Mama. Daddy's gotta fight.

1376
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:26,825
Okay. No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, don't kill him!

1377
01:27:27,529 --> 01:27:29,087
What?

1378
01:27:29,264 --> 01:27:31,391
I just had sex with my new girlfriend.

1379
01:27:31,566 --> 01:27:33,534
- So?
- I had to tell somebody. It was great.

1380
01:27:33,701 --> 01:27:37,193
I loved it. I'm hoping
I'm gonna get another opportunity.

1381
01:27:37,372 --> 01:27:40,933
- What's going on behind you?
- I'm not falling for that.

1382
01:27:43,211 --> 01:27:45,577
Sodomize this!

1383
01:28:00,595 --> 01:28:02,085
Hey, Zed!

1384
01:28:03,164 --> 01:28:04,290
- Stop! No!
- Get back!

1385
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:05,523
- Let her go!
- No!

1386
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,861
The gods demand a sacrifice.
You're ruining it!

1387
01:28:08,036 --> 01:28:10,266
- How about a little more oil?
- Yes, darling?

1388
01:28:19,013 --> 01:28:21,243
I always knew you'd break my heart.

1389
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:23,779
A little hot!

1390
01:28:33,127 --> 01:28:34,890
That was ironic.

1391
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:44,365
So...

1392
01:28:45,139 --> 01:28:46,800
...on behalf of the whole city...

1393
01:28:46,975 --> 01:28:49,808
...l'd like to thank the high priest
for his sacrifice.

1394
01:28:49,978 --> 01:28:52,412
That was really something,
wasn't it?

1395
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,980
Come on. Put your hands together,
it makes a sound.

1396
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:17,338
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>

1397
01:29:22,343 --> 01:29:25,938
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?

1398
01:29:27,549 --> 01:29:28,948
Was that a sign from the gods?

1399
01:29:29,884 --> 01:29:31,613
Everybody wants to know.

1400
01:29:32,787 --> 01:29:35,415
Well, I should know,
because I'm the chosen one, right?

1401
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:37,717
Yeah!

1402
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:39,852
You respect me.

1403
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:41,518
Yeah!

1404
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,422
You love me.

1405
01:29:43,598 --> 01:29:45,259
Yeah!

1406
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,190
You fear me.

1407
01:29:47,368 --> 01:29:49,529
Yeah!

1408
01:29:49,704 --> 01:29:51,433
You would worship me.

1409
01:29:51,606 --> 01:29:53,267
Yeah!

1410
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:56,772
Yeah!

1411
01:30:05,553 --> 01:30:06,645
Well, don't.

1412
01:30:06,821 --> 01:30:09,381
- Yeah!
- No.

1413
01:30:09,557 --> 01:30:12,549
And I'm not saying, "Don't" like,
"I'm the chosen one, so don't."

1414
01:30:12,727 --> 01:30:15,958
I'm saying, "Don't"
because I'm not the chosen one.

1415
01:30:17,231 --> 01:30:21,793
I thought I was, but I'm not, sorry.

1416
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:23,870
Turns out I'm just a guy
from the woods...

1417
01:30:24,038 --> 01:30:28,975
...who was lucky enough to have these
great friends to watch my back.

1418
01:30:32,146 --> 01:30:34,205
I'm telling you, you don't need me.

1419
01:30:34,382 --> 01:30:38,079
You know what? Maybe we can all
make our own destiny.

1420
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,188
Yeah. Maybe we could all
be chosen.

1421
01:30:41,356 --> 01:30:42,983
Yeah.

1422
01:30:43,157 --> 01:30:47,150
- You! You could be chosen!
- Yeah!

1423
01:30:47,328 --> 01:30:51,059
- And you! And you!
- Yeah!

1424
01:30:51,232 --> 01:30:54,099
Way over in the back! You, little guy!

1425
01:30:56,104 --> 01:30:57,537
Yeah!

1426
01:31:25,099 --> 01:31:27,590
- So you're queen.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

1427
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:28,793
Yeah, you could've.

1428
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,995
No, really, I tried for years and...

1429
01:31:31,172 --> 01:31:35,541
All right, maybe you couldn't have.
I was pretty amazing with the old...

1430
01:31:36,277 --> 01:31:39,644
Sorry about almost luring you
to your death.

1431
01:31:39,814 --> 01:31:42,374
Oh, please.

1432
01:31:43,184 --> 01:31:45,175
All right.

1433
01:31:47,555 --> 01:31:48,886
Okay.

1434
01:31:49,957 --> 01:31:51,618
See you later.

1435
01:31:53,928 --> 01:31:55,361
Come on, people.

1436
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:57,623
- Pick up that bag of camel dung.
- Yes, sir.

1437
01:31:57,799 --> 01:31:59,164
Hang on to it all day.

1438
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,460
Hustle up.
These donkeys don't pack themselves.

1439
01:32:01,636 --> 01:32:04,161
- I will kill you where you stand.
- Relax.

1440
01:32:04,338 --> 01:32:07,865
They cut a little off the end but there's
plenty more where that came from.

1441
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:10,567
This is my woman.
Stay away from her, or I'll kill you.

1442
01:32:10,745 --> 01:32:12,736
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
- Just go.

1443
01:32:12,914 --> 01:32:14,506
Get out of here or I'll kill you.

1444
01:32:14,682 --> 01:32:16,274
Cranky today.

1445
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:19,648
So are you still thinking
about going to Egypt?

1446
01:32:19,821 --> 01:32:22,790
Supposed to be a real happening
place. You coming with or not?

1447
01:32:22,957 --> 01:32:27,291
Well, I mean, I was kind of
planning on going anyway, so...

1448
01:32:30,531 --> 01:32:32,931
Let me show you this new style.
Everyone's doing it.

1449
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:36,366
You open your mouth really wide.
It makes it way sexier.

1450
01:32:39,574 --> 01:32:43,840
I'm thinking about introducing the
tongue, but I haven't perfected it yet.

1451
01:32:44,011 --> 01:32:46,639
- You know, we'll work on that.
- All right.

1452
01:32:50,084 --> 01:32:52,848
Look at us. Two men.

1453
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:56,217
One going to lead a village and
the other going to explore the world.

1454
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,483
You sure you don't wanna come back,
help me?

1455
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:02,356
You don't need me. Everybody knows
you're the smartest guy in the village.

1456
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:05,693
Gonna know you're the most
incredible warrior anyone's ever seen.

1457
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:09,166
The way you punched that lady? Man!

1458
01:33:09,337 --> 01:33:10,361
I mean, you know...

1459
01:33:10,538 --> 01:33:14,065
She left me no choice, so I had to,
you know, punch her in the face.

1460
01:33:16,077 --> 01:33:18,511
Well, we'll tell stories about you
around the fire.

1461
01:33:19,147 --> 01:33:22,344
Strangers shake hands.
Get that thing out of here.

1462
01:33:27,054 --> 01:33:29,852
- I'm gonna miss you, little guy.
- I'm gonna miss you more.

1463
01:33:30,358 --> 01:33:33,225
Just trying to sniff you.
I wanna remember your scent.

1464
01:33:33,628 --> 01:33:36,358
That's probably the urine in my hair.

1465
01:33:40,501 --> 01:33:42,992
I can't let them see me cry.
They respect me too much.

1466
01:33:43,171 --> 01:33:47,767
Me too. On three.
One, two, three, break.

1467
01:33:51,078 --> 01:33:53,273
Well, may the gods smile on you.
See you around.

1468
01:33:53,447 --> 01:33:55,312
Whatever. Later.

1469
01:33:55,483 --> 01:33:57,144
- Oh?
- What?

1470
01:33:59,587 --> 01:34:01,987
I want you to have babies
with my sister.

1471
01:34:04,258 --> 01:34:06,818
- Try and stop me.
- All right, man.

1472
01:34:06,994 --> 01:34:11,021
- Zed, may the gods smile on you.
- You said that.

1473
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,133
- May they. Yeah.
- Thank you, though.

1474
01:34:14,535 --> 01:34:18,301
All right come on, folks. We're heading
out now because I say so, all right?

1475
01:34:18,472 --> 01:34:21,999
What's the deal? Come on, Lindsey.
Come on, everyone's looking.

1476
01:34:22,176 --> 01:34:25,441
Please. Go. Good.

1477
01:34:25,613 --> 01:34:27,604
To the north!

1478
01:34:29,483 --> 01:34:31,280
You know that that's west.

1479
01:34:31,452 --> 01:34:33,386
I was just checking to see
if you knew.

1480
01:34:33,554 --> 01:34:35,488
To the west!

1481
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:38,320
I'm already glad you're here.

1482
01:34:58,646 --> 01:35:01,513
One, two, three, foreskin!

1483
01:35:01,983 --> 01:35:04,952
Invoke your blessing
and do your will.

1484
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,485
What's the fucking line? What is it?

1485
01:35:07,655 --> 01:35:09,520
It was a game.
It was a game of chance...

1486
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:12,022
...and he hit his head
and he killed himself.

1487
01:35:12,193 --> 01:35:15,253
If anything, it was a suicide.
Okay.

1488
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:17,420
I let one go.

1489
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:24,829
In honor of the chosen one,
as my first official act as your queen...

1490
01:35:25,006 --> 01:35:27,133
...l'm going to go back
and say the line again.

1491
01:35:27,308 --> 01:35:30,675
- Let's go back. Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah.

1492
01:35:30,845 --> 01:35:32,142
You just want it all.

1493
01:35:32,313 --> 01:35:34,975
You want to taste it all
and know it all and feel it all.

1494
01:35:35,149 --> 01:35:38,141
And suck it all in and blow it all out
your backside, don't you?

1495
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:39,946
Sorry.

1496
01:35:43,824 --> 01:35:46,884
It's like the Great Turtle coming out
of the sea, you know?

1497
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:50,656
It's like with the earth on its back,
you understand?

1498
01:35:50,831 --> 01:35:53,026
I'm an oilman.

1499
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:57,799
You're cursed, Zed, and if you don't
leave here we're all gonna be cursed.

1500
01:35:57,972 --> 01:36:01,373
And it drank up the ocean,
then pooped out the mountains...

1501
01:36:01,542 --> 01:36:04,136
...and the first man
fell from the stars.

1502
01:36:04,312 --> 01:36:07,679
This is... I don't... This doesn't make
a lot of sense, guys.

1503
01:36:07,848 --> 01:36:09,816
Can I talk to Harold?
Is that...?

1504
01:36:27,368 --> 01:36:28,528
What's that?

1505
01:36:28,703 --> 01:36:32,696
What's that?
A strange Gorgon from another time!

1506
01:36:32,873 --> 01:36:36,434
I weep for the suffering
of my people.

1507
01:36:37,445 --> 01:36:38,537
We're getting boned...

1508
01:36:38,713 --> 01:36:41,011
...by the planes, the trains,
and the what, huh?

1509
01:36:41,182 --> 01:36:42,206
Zed?

1510
01:36:42,383 --> 01:36:45,216
- Oh, that's great.
- Zed? It's constricting me.

1511
01:36:45,586 --> 01:36:48,487
Can I show you this new kiss
I been thinking about?

1512
01:36:48,656 --> 01:36:51,853
- Yeah.
- It's called a tongue kiss.

1513
01:36:56,163 --> 01:36:59,326
- It's strange. Yeah. Okay.
- Still perfecting it, yeah.

1514
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,832
- It's fine.
- All right.

1515
01:37:02,003 --> 01:37:03,630
What?

1516
01:37:12,046 --> 01:37:14,412
And camera reloading!
