I don't know what you're saying!
I don't know what you're saying!

10
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:35,176
I don't know what you're fucking saying.
I don't understand.

00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,251
- William.

00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:11,893
I have something special for you.

14
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,355
I have something special.

15
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:17,799
Take it.

16
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,060
It's heroin.

17
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,416
Take a seat.

18
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,604
You okay?

00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:56,573
Okay?

20
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,566
You okay? Hey.

21
00:13:58,874 --> 00:13:59,709
You...

22
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,711
We are the same.

23
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,380
I...

24
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,965
Yeah.

25
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:11,804
You!

26
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:13,765
You.

27
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:15,308
Look at me.

28
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:16,934
Look.

29
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,021
Dead.

30
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:24,942
Look.

31
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:31,616
Come on...

32
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:35,370
I'm your friend.

33
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,121
I am Tiffany.

34
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:38,623
My name is Tiffany.

35
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,500
I am so beautiful inside.

36
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,168
You're sick.

37
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:19,163
If the guards find anyone gambling,
smoking, or tattooing,

38
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:21,666
you'll be punished.

39
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,167
Understand?

40
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:26,796
Stand up.

41
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,591
Walk to the dormitory.

42
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,636
Stay in line. No talking.

43
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,067
Get off me!

44
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,697
Get off! Get off!

45
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:55,176
You want to fucking fight?

46
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,491
Your name?

47
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:24,409

00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,743

00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,101

Sit down!

60
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,482
You have money?

00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:56,816
- No.

62
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,695
You work?

You understand?

69
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,594
Yes, I understand.

70
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:25,803
No, no cock.

71
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:26,929
- No cock?
- No cock.

72
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:28,765
No cock. No more?

73
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:29,849
No more.

74
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:34,937
Stand up, Billy! Stand up!

75
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,184
Twenty.

76
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,430
Listen. Twenty.

77
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:54,482
One.

78
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,927
No.

79
00:20:58,294 --> 00:20:59,629
Go on.

80
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:07,136
- Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15.
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:32,912

What are you doing now?
Don't fucking touch me!

83
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,985
Fuck off!

84
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:27,091
Yeah.

85
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,719
You! Don't speak!

86
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:41,078
Okay?

87
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:42,539
You...

88
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,149
Sit down!

89
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:46,918
All right?

90
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,405
I need painkillers.

91
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:23,865
I don't have.

92
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:26,951
What do you mean you don't have?
You're an infirmiry.

93
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:29,245
I'm told you do tramadol for free.

94
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:30,530
Not free for you.

95
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:34,166
What do you mean, it's not free? I've just
seen you give it to five people in a row.

96
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:35,610
You need to pay.

97
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,496
No, I've got no money.

98
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,215
I've got no money. I've been told it's free.

99
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:42,984
You have cigarette for me?

100
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:45,136
I don't have no...

101
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:48,681
I have no cigarettes, okay?
I've got no pull here.

102
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:50,067
And I just want tramadol.

103
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:52,644
This is not right.

104
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:54,604
Give me the... no, fuck you!

105
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,371
Who wants to fucking go next?

106
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,841
Who wants to fucking go next?

107
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:55,262
You love ladyboys?

108
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:57,138
You love ladyboys?

109
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:07,324
Hey.

110
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:12,562
Yes.

111
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,273
You remember me?

112
00:33:17,408 --> 00:33:18,835
I just wanted to...

113
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:21,187
say thank you...

114
00:33:21,537 --> 00:33:22,705
for the other day.

115
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:25,425
For what?

116
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:29,128
For helping me when I was in a bad way.

117
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,142
Okay.

118
00:33:36,176 --> 00:33:39,597
And I wanted to ask as well
if I could get some cigarettes.

119
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:47,522
Your family put money in your account, right?

120
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:48,731
I've got no family.

121
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:56,448
No family, no money, no cigarettes.

122
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,867
I'm gonna get some money
next week, okay? In my account.

123
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,288
I need you to borrow me some
cigarettes. I'll pay you back.

124
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:05,832
I give you only one.

125
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:10,962
- Which one?
- Red ones.

126
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:16,217
Tell me your name, please.

127
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,169
Billy.

128
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,764
- What's your name, by the way?
- My name is Fame.

129
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,393
- Nice to meet you, Fame.
- Nice to meet you, Billy.

130
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,247
Can I just get one more packet, please?

131
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:53,976
Why is the fan blade missing?

132
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:59,231
- Cell Boss! Where is the blade?
- I don't know, sir!

133
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:00,983
How the hell don't you know?

134
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,902
Everybody! In the yard!

135
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:06,781
Someone got killed.

136
00:40:17,994 --> 00:40:19,364
I found yaba, sir.

137
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:26,996
It's not mine.

138
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:29,466
It's not mine.

139
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:31,968
Confess, Billy.

140
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,169
It's not mine.

141
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:38,190
Look, this is mine.

142
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:40,518
That's mine. That's my top. That's my top.

143
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,854
This is definitely not mine, I swear to God.

144
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:45,690
That's not my shirt! That's...

145
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:49,444
No, that's fucking not mine!
Look, it doesn't even fit!

146
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:53,531
It doesn't even fucking fit.
Look! It's fucking too small.

147
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:55,074
It doesn't even fucking fit.

148
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,329
I swear, it's not mine.
I promise you, it's not mine.

149
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,283
Hey. Hey, the heroin.

150
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:22,672
Get inside.

151
00:43:56,255 --> 00:43:57,590
Hey, you.

152
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:05,957
Yaba.

153
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:08,401
My yaba.

154
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:15,800
My yaba.

155
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:21,364
It's from a ladyboy.

156
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:22,324
Ladyboy?

157
00:44:50,642 --> 00:44:52,019
You got the stuff, man?

158
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:53,630
Step back.

159
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:58,192
Fuck you!

160
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,487
Fuck you!

161
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:06,117
Where is your fucking heart, man?
Where is your fucking heart?

162
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,369
You just pay me.

163
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:11,038
If you don't have money, the Muslim guys...

164
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:13,249
just beat them for me.

165
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:14,917
Smash them.

166
00:45:15,376 --> 00:45:17,379
They're not good for my business.

167
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,510
I'm not gonna beat up
some fucking Muslims, all right?

168
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:26,304
You're a boxer, man. Don't be scared.

169
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:30,517
I'm not fucking scared.
I don't give a fuck about that.

170
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,312
I'm not scared. I'll beat up everyone
in this fucking prison if I have to.

171
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:36,939
I'm saying to you I just need a hit now.

172
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:40,360
If you fucking give me a hit now,
I'll fucking do whatever you want, man.

173
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,445
I'll do whatever you fucking want.

174
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,083
They almost died.

175
00:46:47,301 --> 00:46:48,472
Take it.

176
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:51,598
I told you, just beat them,
not try to kill them.

177
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:54,008
Take it.

178
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:02,068
Billy!

179
00:48:41,582 --> 00:48:43,285
<i>Family visit...</i>

180

I'm happy to see you.

183
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:21,531
Are you okay?

184
00:49:27,628 --> 00:49:29,714
I had a fight.

185
00:49:33,425 --> 00:49:34,702
I won.

186
00:49:35,135 --> 00:49:36,379
Number one.

187

I'm sorry to see you like this.

188
00:50:00,118 --> 00:50:01,037
It's all right.

189
00:50:11,963 --> 00:50:13,190
Take care...

190
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:15,242
Billy.

191
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:17,572
Stop!

192
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:19,031
Sit down!

193
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:23,411
Why don't you care about each other?

194
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:27,332
You eat together.

195
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:30,502
You sleep in the same room.

196
00:51:31,126 --> 00:51:32,754
You do activities together.

197
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:35,172
Don't you have any sense of unity?

198
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,592
Prison is for men,

199
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:39,886
not for dogs!

200
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:42,555
Can't you speak to one another?

201
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:44,641
Why do you fight?

202
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:46,809
What is there to gain?

203
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,424
I'm here to train.

204
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:21,135
I want to train!

205
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:34,899
Go!

206
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:37,694
I'm a boxer. I can show you I can fight.

207
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,321
I need to fight.

208
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:41,331
Let me in.

209
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:45,518
Come on, just...

210
00:52:45,784 --> 00:52:49,038
Just let me show you, all right?
Same, same. I'm a boxer.

211
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:51,708
Go!

212
00:52:52,165 --> 00:52:54,168
Come on, man. Let me in.

213
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,794
Hey.

214
00:53:16,357 --> 00:53:17,634
How are you?

215
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:24,407
Look, I'm sorry about not bringing
the cigarettes back.

216
00:53:30,078 --> 00:53:31,873
I've had a fucking rough time.

217
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:40,382
And I was wondering maybe
if I could get some more cigarettes.

218
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:43,635
Join the boxing team.

219
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:46,137
I want to fight again.

220
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:50,850
Just give me this one chance
and I promise I'll pay you back.

221
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:52,644
I sear to God, Fame.

222
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:55,888
I'll prove to you.

223
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:05,607
I'll make it up to you.

224
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,867
I'll make it up to you.

225
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:12,297
Hey.

226
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:14,231
Hey.

227
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,000
I've got the cigarettes.

228
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:38,527
Your turn.

229
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:39,742
Okay.

230
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:46,826
You fight?

231
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:48,695
- Boxing.
- Oh, boxing.

232
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:18,102
I want to bet.

233
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:19,679
Cigarettes.

234
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:21,055
- How many?
- Two packs.

235
01:00:16,985 --> 01:00:19,071
My fish won. Hey, two packs.

236
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:20,532
- Cigarettes.
- No.

237
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:23,318
- My fucking fish won.
- It wins every time.

238
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:25,253
My fish won.

239
01:00:25,786 --> 01:00:27,455
Give me two packs of cigarettes.

240
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:29,374
I fucking won, man.

241
01:00:29,831 --> 01:00:31,083
I fucking won.

242
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,209
Fucking...

243
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,434
The rule is the rule. He won.

244
01:00:47,516 --> 01:00:50,520
No, boss. This prick is tricky.

245
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:53,315
Follow the rules. How much did he bet?

246
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:25,455
Hey.

247
01:01:30,225 --> 01:01:31,769
It's from your girlfriend?

248
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:35,231
No, no, no. Fighting fish.

249
01:01:35,814 --> 01:01:37,400
- Okay.
- I won a bet.

250
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:39,736
No girlfriend, no family.

251
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:41,070
No, no girlfriend.

252
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,491
I wanted to apologize, actually.

253
01:01:45,073 --> 01:01:46,075
Because...

254
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,745
I lied to you about my dad.

255
01:01:49,536 --> 01:01:50,747
Not having a family.

256
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:54,166
I've got a dad, I've got brothers.

257
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,628
They don't know I'm in prison.

258
01:01:57,794 --> 01:01:59,013
It's okay.

259
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:03,092
Why are you in here anyway?

260
01:02:03,174 --> 01:02:04,552
I killed my father.

261
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,874
Why?

262
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:13,653
He beat me.

263
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:18,275
He was not happy with who I am.

264
01:02:51,932 --> 01:02:53,150
Sorry.

265
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,806
Put 'em up, man. Put 'em up.

266
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,626
Put 'em up!

267
01:03:36,685 --> 01:03:38,170
Put 'em up.

268
01:03:39,855 --> 01:03:41,065
William.

269
01:03:43,191 --> 01:03:44,319
Just fucking do it.

270
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:49,907
See and decide.

271
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:52,369
You... No! Okay?

272
01:03:52,451 --> 01:03:53,528
Again.

273
01:04:18,226 --> 01:04:19,262
Strong.

274
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:22,173
Okay.

275
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:09,812
Hey.

276
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:15,527
Hey.

277
01:05:26,712 --> 01:05:27,755
78.

278
01:06:09,546 --> 01:06:10,382
Hey!

279
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:11,499
Fucking go!

280
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:13,376
Fucking go!

281
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:14,394
Your fight at Songkran was a fucking mess.

282
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:16,563
You will be transferred.

283
01:11:17,896 --> 01:11:20,942
You're going to move to the boxing team cell

284
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:22,777
and share their privileges.

285
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:27,740
You're the first foreigner to compete
to qualify for national tournament.

286
01:11:27,823 --> 01:11:29,409
Consider this an honor.

287
01:11:30,492 --> 01:11:32,954
The tournament will take place
in another prison.

288
01:11:33,036 --> 01:11:35,164
You have only two months to train.

289
01:11:35,246 --> 01:11:37,959
If you don't want to represent
our prison, say now.

290
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:39,477
I can.

291
01:11:41,628 --> 01:11:43,047
- I want to fight.
- Good.

292
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:48,353
Thank you, sir.

293
01:11:54,925 --> 01:11:56,288
Wait.

294
01:11:59,771 --> 01:12:00,898
From your father.

295
01:12:19,733 --> 01:12:20,952
Thank you, sir.

296
01:12:25,672 --> 01:12:27,124
William Moore.

297
01:12:31,553 --> 01:12:33,973
See you later, man.
Look after yourself, all right?

298
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,934
When I was arrested,

299
01:14:42,017 --> 01:14:46,564
I pleaded guilty for my girlfriend.

300
01:14:46,647 --> 01:14:49,066
I got five years.

301
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:52,570
When I realized I was gonna
be in for five years,

302
01:14:52,653 --> 01:14:54,822
I went wild.

303
01:14:55,196 --> 01:14:59,494
I killed three people
in prison, stabbed them.

304
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:01,871
Three. Three people.

305
01:15:02,954 --> 01:15:04,582
He killed three.

306
01:15:04,665 --> 01:15:06,918
It's been 13 years now.

307
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,172
Seeing people leaving this prison
makes me want to go home.

308
01:15:11,255 --> 01:15:15,385
So I joined the boxing team,
trying to be a better man.

309
01:15:16,134 --> 01:15:19,347
You know what you get from being a boxer?

310
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:23,893
Your life inside here is better
than any regular prisoner's.

311
01:15:23,975 --> 01:15:29,857
Sometimes, you can fight outside
and see your family.

312
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:34,070
Even if it's just for a few minutes,
it warms your heart.

313
01:15:34,986 --> 01:15:36,197
Me...

314
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:41,536
South Thailand and Bangkok.

315
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:44,747
- I killed...
- Two people.

316
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:48,710
My family is poor,
so I decided to be a hitman.

317
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:51,838
Life sentence for a hitman.

318
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:49,974
William.

319
01:19:23,006 --> 01:19:24,241
You...

320
01:19:25,426 --> 01:19:26,555
No good.

321
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:27,637
You start here.

322
01:19:30,847 --> 01:19:32,099
- Okay?
- All right.

323
01:19:32,182 --> 01:19:33,225
Go, William.

324
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:08,840
Fame.

325
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:11,301
Fame.

326
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:13,636
Hey, sorry, I'm busy now.

327
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:15,763
I'm busy now, okay?

328
01:22:17,055 --> 01:22:18,858
I'm not talking to you.

329
01:22:22,853 --> 01:22:24,689
I'm not fucking talking to you!

330
01:22:25,063 --> 01:22:26,524
I'm not fucking talking to you!

331
01:22:30,527 --> 01:22:31,363
Come here!

332
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:33,990
I fucking want to know!
I want to fucking know!

333
01:22:34,072 --> 01:22:37,827
Come over here. You're a fucking liar.

334
01:22:38,785 --> 01:22:40,363
You're a fucking liar!

335
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:05,772
I said fucking hit me!

336
01:23:05,854 --> 01:23:07,189
Fucking hit me.

337
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:10,151
Come on. Fucking hit me.

338
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:11,986
Come on. Fucking hit me, man.

339
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:14,822
Fucking hit me then, okay?

340
01:23:14,905 --> 01:23:16,366
Fucking hit me!

341
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,410
Hey! Fucking hit me.

342
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:20,127
Hey!

343
01:26:06,034 --> 01:26:08,621
Hey, I'm sorry, okay? I fucked up.

344
01:26:08,704 --> 01:26:10,873
- I made a mistake.
- Sorry?

345
01:26:15,961 --> 01:26:17,589
Look, I'm fucking sorry.

346
01:28:25,966 --> 01:28:28,886
This song is about a woman

347
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:34,016
who is ready to wait forever
for the man she loves.

348
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:34,596
Okay. One more!

349
01:30:44,145 --> 01:30:45,632
Hey, Billy.

350
01:30:47,691 --> 01:30:48,810
Money!

351
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,806
I'm gonna get your money, all right?
I'm gonna get it.

352
01:30:53,889 --> 01:30:56,645
I've got a fight coming up.
I'm gonna win, okay?

353
01:30:56,725 --> 01:30:59,496
I'm gonna win. I'm gonna fight.
I'm gonna win, okay?

354
01:31:00,245 --> 01:31:03,249
I'm gonna fucking win, all right?
I'm gonna fucking win, okay?

355
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:24,437
I'm gonna get the money for you,
all right? I'm gonna win the fight.

356
01:31:25,262 --> 01:31:26,398
No.

357
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,441
I got AIDS. You want?

358
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:36,874
You lose...

359
01:32:30,126 --> 01:32:31,404
I'm okay.

360
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,901
I've got to tell them I'm coming up.

361
01:33:35,859 --> 01:33:36,944
It's all I've got.

362
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:41,741
The reason you have a rupture
is because of boxing

363
01:33:41,823 --> 01:33:44,494
and the massive abuse of drugs and alcohol.

364
01:33:45,994 --> 01:33:47,789
Any more trauma and frankly...

365
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,832
you could bleed to death.

366
01:33:53,377 --> 01:33:54,579
Look, Mr. Moore.

367
01:33:55,337 --> 01:33:56,556
I'm sorry.

368
01:34:00,884 --> 01:34:02,462
I'll keep my guard up.

369
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,029
William Moore.

370
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:11,721
Okay.

371
01:42:24,321 --> 01:42:25,657
Okay?

372
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:53,363
- Billy!
