1
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:23,593
Bucharest, Romania

2
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,881
What?

3
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:00,792
Why are you a thief, Jack?

4
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,393
Diplomatic corps wouldn`t take me.

5
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:09,363
Besides, l like to think that l`m doing
my part...

6
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:11,800
for international relations.

7
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,299
You`ve been here six months, Tuliver.

8
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:16,602
All you want to do is joke and play.

9
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,438
Americans, never a straight answer.

10
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:24,346
Military taught me three things:

11
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,917
how to kill, how to steal...

12
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,751
and never surrender information.

13
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:35,622
l wasn`t much on the killing part.
But l`m willing to try again.

14
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,996
lf you know what l mean.

15
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:41,600
For my country, of course.

16
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,602
You can do so much with your life.

17
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:46,929
l am doing something.

18
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:50,372
- We are doing something.
- Well, we can do some more.

19
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,977
No.

20
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,842
Come back here, Suza.

21
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:57,715
Get dressed.

22
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,485
Don`t be late for work.

23
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,525
l hate work.

24
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,320
She was a mature woman.

25
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:13,796
Mature women run at Spanky.

26
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:16,697
Did you wear
your ``Don`t fuck me, l`m a queer`` T-shirt?

27
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:18,997
She was crazy begging for it.

28
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,370
Begging me to give it to her, Spanky style.

29
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,910
The last woman to beg you to do anything
was your mama...

30
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:28,105
and that was to clean up your room.

31
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:30,281
l was sporting it fresh, mate.

32
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:33,576
Pimp daddy.
Eastern Bloc loves Western cock.

33
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:36,587
- Know what l mean?
- Oh, you know what l mean?

34
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,123
- You sure that thing`s gonna work?
- T!

35
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,184
- And the detonators?
- Everything`s cool.

36
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:44,388
Just like the plan, T-man.

37
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:47,232
Three trucks.

38
00:03:58,444 --> 00:03:59,638
Three locations.

39
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,403
Go!

40
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:03,071
Kill the engine.

41
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,210
Let`s move.

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,410
Do it. Go!

43
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:12,649
We`ve been hit.

44
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,551
One prize depot.

45
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,890
Sectors 3 and 5...

46
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,090
Christ.

47
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,632
...Code 14 alert.

48
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:22,894
Shit.

49
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:24,867
- Three signals.
- Three trucks.

50
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:28,368
Twenty casinos unloading
all at the same time.

51
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,516
Gentlemen, we are about to be
$20 million richer.

52
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,222
Get out of the truck! Get your ass out.
Down on the ground!

53
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,817
Get on the ground!

54
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,121
Get your ass out of there! Lay down!

55
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,800
Move it!

56
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,400
l sure hope you have big pockets.

57
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,764
Call the police.

58
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:03,968
`Cause that`s $3 million apiece.

59
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,407
- On the ground, stay down!
- Don`t shoot.

60
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:07,536
- Open the back!
- l can`t.

61
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,341
Open the back or l`ll open your head!

62
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,814
- l can`t. lt`s on timer.
- Manual open it.

63
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,318
No, it`s on timer.
lt only opens at the location or the depot.

64
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:18,617
You blew the electrics. l can`t open it.

65
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,706
Seven seconds.

66
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,390
Where did you find those timers? Pull out.

67
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:05,670
Team One, out.

68
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:08,429
- Out! Back to the van!
- Pull out!

69
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,872
Team Two, talk to me. Pull out.

70
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:19,646
- Move your ass.
- Get in!

71
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:21,814
Move your ass, Charlie.

72
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:26,155
Yes, who is this? Yes, Capt. Szabo.

73
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,251
Yes, we do. Well, they must have our routes.

74
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:33,559
l`m pulling all the trucks back
to the main depot.

75
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,361
Can we get police escorts?

76
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:36,899
- How many trucks?
- Fourteen.

77
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,765
Pull them all back on high alert.

78
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,606
You catch these bastards, Captain.

79
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,839
All trucks, Code 86.

80
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:52,450
Return immediately to the depot.

81
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,019
Problem. We`re turning around,
back to the depot.

82
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,145
- Why?
- We`re all being pulled back.

83
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:59,383
Police escort is on its way.

84
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:30,021
Hello, Cristina.

85
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,527
Okay, gentlemen, we have a situation.

86
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,757
Please take that to the vault
and lock up your shotguns. Thank you.

87
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,425
We don`t work for Vanderbrink.
No overtime for us.

88
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,867
And our case is for
Mr. Bostnescu in Bucharest.

89
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,666
- Vanderbrink policy--
- Change of policy, Barney.

90
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,506
Get us a driver.

91
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:52,873
And get us and this case to our location.
Right now.

92
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,380
- Touchy.
- Touchy assholes.

93
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:18,534
- Sorry, Mr. Vanderbrink.
- No, that`s fine.

94
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:20,166
What`s going on?

95
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:23,969
You better go to the briefing room, Cristina.
No phones.

96
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:36,079
Thirteen.

97
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:09,113
Okay, everyone in the truck.

98
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,250
Here we go again.

99
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,487
One more time!

100
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:17,027
Come on, move it out, people. Move it out.

101
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,890
How`s the foot, Bull?

102
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:21,796
Were you raised by hamsters or something?

103
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:23,791
Crazy hamsters, Bull.

104
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:33,411
We got eight minutes
till the final crew arrives.

105
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:35,979
And most likely
the Bucharest Police Department...

106
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:39,517
and about 3,000 NATO troops
stationed at various bases around this city.

107
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,781
So, be quick, be quiet, be clean.

108
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:44,953
Oh, yeah, another thing.

109
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:48,515
Last person on the beach
can kiss my sandy ass.

110
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,291
Sync. Let`s go.

111
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:11,379
Oh, shit.

112
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:15,285
Hey, let`s play a game.

113
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,211
Get on the floor! Get on the fucking floor!

114
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:44,104
Go!

115
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,050
Everything`s secure
and everyone`s accounted for?

116
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:54,648
Last truck is at the gates now.

117
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,923
Everything`s in the vault.
Except for the two posers in Truck Four.

118
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,590
Will you go and talk to them?
l`ll debrief the crew.

119
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,835
- Go!
- Three minutes and counting.

120
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:17,712
Should read your classics, man.

121
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,483
Everything`s here. Come and get it.

122
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,283
Bring them in.

123
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:46,434
Vanderbrink Securities came to Romania
to do business.

124
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:05,225
Your decisive actions this morning...

125
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,061
has kept Vanderbrink
the most secure transport in the world.

126
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,541
Unfortunately...

127
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:30,949
a police captain is on his way
to interview each and every one of you.

128
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:34,457
But just, please,
be as honest with him as you can be.

129
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,928
Where`s Cristina?

130
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:47,061
Cristina Grigore?

131
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:50,975
- Jack.
- Nice job.

132
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,108
One minute!

133
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,927
Anyone got a cell phone?

134
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,058
Sorry, Mr. Vanderbrink.

135
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,895
No. Of course not.

136
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,000
That`s it.

137
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:37,648
Ready?

138
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,255
- Shall l drive?
- Men.

139
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:02,412
Two pros.
One of them had a case tied to his arm.

140
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,642
lt must be something big.

141
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,411
- He wouldn`t let go.
- How big?

142
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,444
Oh, shit.

143
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:49,523
An ArmorLite.

144
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:53,758
Couldn`t put a bullet through this.
Practically impossible to open.

145
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:57,357
One-time keypad, custom job, very hi-tech.

146
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:01,567
Nice. This case is smoking up, baby!

147
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:03,540
Happy birthday.

148
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:05,633
Get the bags. Let`s move it.

149
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:13,480
Sir, l had to call in a NATO bomb squad.

150
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:00,989
No, sir, not yet.

151
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:02,123
- Captain.
- Not now.

152
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:03,895
- But, Captain--
- Hold on, Commissioner.

153
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:05,060
l`m--

154
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:08,095
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

155
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:12,469
l love the smell of Fart Putty in the morning.

156
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:16,272
My kids have some.
Drive me nuts with it all day.

157
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,446
Get me Vanderbrink.

158
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:27,054
- No answer.
- Get someone over there, now!

159
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:42,468
Whoa, what?

160
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:45,266
What`s the matter?

161
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,046
Why`d you stop, Charlie?

162
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,643
- Why`d you stop driving?
- Charlie who?

163
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:18,500
Jack!

164
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,478
Bang, bang, bang!

165
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:41,127
No, Bull!

166
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:51,107
Give us the case, Tuliver, or you won`t live!

167
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,757
Jack!

168
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:10,491
- Kill him.
- Jack!

169
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:13,860
Don`t shoot the case.

170
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:32,705
Go!

171
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:39,012
Explain this one to me.

172
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:43,290
How was the suspect driving in your car,
holding your gun, Sgt. Anders?

173
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,093
l was buying coffee.

174
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,366
English?

175
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:50,400
- That bad?
- Not that bad.

176
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,665
Police?

177
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:57,636
Military police. Weekend pass from the base.

178
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,004
ln Costanza?

179
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:00,975
l thought it was an American base.

180
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,172
lt`s a NATO base, so it`s mostly Americans.

181
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:05,579
Some Brits. Not too many French.

182
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:08,712
Shit.

183
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:20,125
Stay down. Stay inside. Call the police.

184
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,761
Drop the case, Tuliver.

185
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,849
You, stay!

186
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:41,849
Shoot him!

187
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,511
Police. Drop it!

188
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,923
- Armed robbery in progress.
- Get the case.

189
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,557
- Vanderbrink Security.
- Get the case.

190
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,158
All units to Pietra Romano.

191
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,329
Suspect armed and dangerous.

192
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:02,167
Car. Yeah, car.

193
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:03,774
- No.
- Yeah.

194
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,900
- Look, l need a ride.
- Shit.

195
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,442
Throw the case in the car.

196
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,167
- Jeez!
- Hold on!

197
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:42,146
Crap.

198
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:47,845
- You may have a death wish. l don`t.
- That`s good, Private.

199
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:51,453
You just stay like you are,
we`ll get along just fine.

200
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,557
That`s Sgt. Anders, Shit Bag.

201
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:57,657
You`ll be meeting
the rest of the army real soon.

202
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,797
Armed robbery, kidnapping a military
police officer, a high-speed felony pursuit.

203
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:13,038
l`m sure they`ll go easy on you in
the Romanian prison system.

204
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:14,338
What do you think, Brains?

205
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,509
Or do you prefer Shit Bag?

206
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,815
No!

207
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,597
My car!

208
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:38,635
Just keep your panties on, okay?

209
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,607
No!

210
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:00,522
Shit.

211
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:10,583
Hate to love you and leave you.

212
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:18,427
Today, Sergeant. Today.

213
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:25,336
Cheeky bastard.

214
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:27,938
Phone.

215
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:33,066
Shit. l just bought that car, you wanker.

216
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,350
What is in you that is so hot?

217
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:49,155
Then what, Sgt. Anders?

218
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,128
Then, for the fifth time,
the shit bag kidnapped me...

219
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:55,958
stole my car,
and trashed at least two cruisers...

220
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,592
motorcycles, and God knows what else!

221
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:00,736
Then, he just let you go?

222
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:04,937
What are you hiding, huh, Anders?

223
00:25:05,076 --> 00:25:06,976
l could hide my foot up your--

224
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:13,873
- Sgt. Anders is cooperating fully, l see.
- Does she belong to you?

225
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:16,384
- Maj. Wilson, U.S. Embassy.
- Good.

226
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:20,150
Maybe you can tell me why,
of all people, your Sgt. Anders...

227
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:23,227
happened to be visiting from a NATO base
three hours away...

228
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:27,128
and conveniently buys a coffee in the street,
an American robs 20 casinos...

229
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:28,198
a priceless case...

230
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,199
- That`s hardly a reason--
- ...shoots a cop...

231
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:34,635
then your Sgt. Anders drives him away,
oh, and gives him a gun.

232
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:38,800
Captain, Sgt. Anders has been in
the Military Police Department for two years.

233
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,605
- l can assure you, she is not--
- Look. lt was an inside job.

234
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:46,212
l don`t think our guy is the killer.
He saved my life, sir.

235
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:50,879
And you are so grateful that you drove
him away with $65-million case.

236
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,854
Sgt. Anders, would you
step outside, please?

237
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:55,619
Excuse me.
You have some jurisdiction here?

238
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:57,260
Are we under military command?

239
00:25:57,362 --> 00:26:00,331
l know you guys are invading
all over Romania. Should l salute?

240
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:03,093
Capt. Szabo, you did call in
a NATO bomb squad.

241
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:05,462
And you are illegally detaining
a British citizen.

242
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,936
Report to Lts. Tool and Banner.

243
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,908
Don`t go too far, Anders.

244
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,647
New uniform or is it casual day today,
Sergeant? l didn`t get the memo.

245
00:26:22,754 --> 00:26:25,348
- Fun joy ride, Sgt. Anders?
- Spectacular, sir.

246
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,447
Gun and car. lmpressive.

247
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,049
Did he tip?
You didn`t drive him, too, did you?

248
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:32,152
Yeah. Nuts, hopefully.

249
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,621
- What do you need, Lieutenant?
- Photo fit.

250
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:38,668
Check the files to see if he comes up in a
mug shot in American, European databases.

251
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,898
The guy was a pro. l think it was two gangs,
one hitting the other.

252
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:48,570
Sgt. Anders, l have spoken with
your superior officer in Costanza.

253
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:52,376
The only pro you`ve ever seen
fixed the copier in your office.

254
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,051
Leave the detection work to us.

255
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,989
- Do l need a lawyer, sir?
- You bet your ass.

256
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:06,688
You two have been assigned a desk,
in there. Get to work.

257
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:14,465
He answered your cell after the robbery?

258
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,508
Yeah, l lost that, too, sir.

259
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:27,544
Hello.

260
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:30,746
No, l`m sorry,
Kelly had to step out for a minute.

261
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:32,880
Call back later. Bye-bye.

262
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:37,856
Pray to God Almighty
you do not know this man, Sergeant.

263
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:40,055
You`ll face a court-martial.

264
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:43,793
Just wanted to make sure
we`re clear on that.

265
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:48,730
Anders? Kelly Anders? We found your car.

266
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,276
l`m gonna kill that son of a bitch.

267
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,584
What was so difficult?

268
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:08,282
The case goes to Amsterdam, then to Berlin,
then you bring it back here to me.

269
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:11,657
Mr. Grapini, the depot security
wouldn`t let us get--

270
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:13,628
You`re not going to make excuses.

271
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:17,394
Please tell me you`re not going to
justify losing the van Gogh...

272
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:19,197
What my partner was trying to say was--

273
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:23,000
...worth $65 million.

274
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:29,577
You have one of two options:

275
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:34,414
l can give you nothing
and ruin your careers...

276
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:38,478
or l can triple your fee.

277
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:45,321
Find that painting and bring it to me,
or destroy it.

278
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:47,592
l don`t care which.

279
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,531
Bargaining chip.

280
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:43,746
l think you had better pray
that Tuliver loves you above all things...

281
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,387
little Suza.

282
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:52,863
Yes, sir.

283
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:03,201
You and your girlfriend packing for
a vacation, Spanky?

284
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:05,108
Yeah.

285
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:08,968
l took the blanks out of this one.

286
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:16,452
That was good, though. l must say.
Switching ammo and everything.

287
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:17,680
Not me, man.

288
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:21,588
Come on, T, you brought me in on this.
``$20 mil.

289
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,990
``Just come meet Suza. Suza`s got a plan.``

290
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:28,361
And you came back to your apartment?
Spanky, that`s the very first rule.

291
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:30,601
Never go back to your apartment.

292
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,933
You know, l pulled together
some of the best soldiers l know.

293
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:36,698
And you.

294
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:40,877
Now they`re all dead. But not you.

295
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:43,071
Please, l`m cool. J.T.

296
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,214
l need a name, Spanky.

297
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:51,515
You know they took Suza? Suza, Spanky!

298
00:30:51,622 --> 00:30:54,216
- J.T., l wouldn`t do you bad.
- Oh?

299
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:55,519
l`m just here to do the work.

300
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:56,684
- Right, right.
- That`s all.

301
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:58,318
Do you know what l mean?

302
00:30:58,863 --> 00:31:00,330
Oh, fuck, man.

303
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:02,092
Please.

304
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:56,913
Okay.

305
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:02,788
No, don`t leave. You will hurt our feelings.

306
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,626
Have we met?

307
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:10,028
l`ll be your mugger tonight.
You have our case.

308
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:13,936
- You got my friend.
- We have your friend`s life.

309
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:16,900
Well, you kill me
then you never get the case.

310
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,373
Who said anything about killing you?

311
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,380
lt`s in a locker in the bus station.
The key`s in my left pants pocket.

312
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:30,411
Go on, check.

313
00:32:32,556 --> 00:32:35,252
l was informed that you would be
more difficult.

314
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,020
- Check him.
- Come on.

315
00:32:58,449 --> 00:32:59,939
Spanky style.

316
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:11,861
What the fuck?

317
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:17,694
- Alexsie Kutchinov.
- l`m hungry.

318
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,797
Eating peas...

319
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,266
has become like climbing
the Ural Mountains.

320
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,331
How much money for a cure?

321
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,170
Nothing. There is no cure.

322
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:09,018
lrony always bites you...

323
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,212
in the ankles.

324
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:20,856
l hate to lose things, Spanky.

325
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,124
lt is Spanky, isn`t it?

326
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:29,732
Have you any idea
how ugly that can make me?

327
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:32,932
Ugly as a crack ho on smack, Daddy?

328
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:40,476
- Tuliver?
- Don`t know the cat.

329
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:42,176
Tuliver...

330
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:46,655
who just made me $20 million
ripping off every casino in the city.

331
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:51,826
l`m on vacation.
l don`t know no Tuliver man, dude.

332
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:55,530
lf you insist on lying to me, Spanky...

333
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,397
l will shoot you.

334
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:02,769
They will drop you in the river.

335
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:06,275
Now, was it not Tuliver...

336
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:09,175
who killed six of my soldiers
in your apartment?

337
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:13,444
Was it not Tuliver who organized the heist...

338
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:15,775
and stole my case?

339
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,882
l don`t know zip, P. Diddy.

340
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:22,558
Dudes tried to jump up my crib...

341
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,097
and then bam, Spanky was out,
just like Buster Douglas.

342
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,667
Except for that Tyson fight.

343
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:38,065
Okay. We have a saying in my country.

344
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,377
No.

345
00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:46,111
``The shoe salesman...

346
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,716
``he never carries shoes.``

347
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:03,257
Now, where is Tuliver?

348
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:09,299
- Who does he trust?
- l don`t know.

349
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:12,469
Spanky!

350
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,024
Damn it! Just can`t...

351
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,690
Mercea.

352
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,797
Mikhail Mercea.

353
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:44,338
Mikhail Mercea? Yes, l know him.

354
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:46,273
l know him.

355
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,379
Yeah. Okay. Good.

356
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:52,382
Spanky. Very good.

357
00:37:00,124 --> 00:37:03,218
You want a sweet? Okay.

358
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:04,653
Check.

359
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:18,441
l love Romania.

360
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:50,906
Nothing. l don`t think
he`s been picked up before.

361
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:55,375
- Just look, Sergeant. Don`t think.
- He knew my badge was a military lD.

362
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,014
Military?

363
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,517
Back in the box, My Little Pony.

364
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,282
Lt. Tool, there was something wrong
with the shooting.

365
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,017
So l don`t think he`s the triggerman.

366
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:11,117
Cry me a river. He`s a cop-killer, in my book.

367
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:13,930
Why don`t you clear up a little around here?

368
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:18,661
Look for your new boyfriend`s face. Unless,
of course, you ain`t looking too hard.

369
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,367
Steal my phone, too, Shit Bag?

370
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:00,204
Sorry. It압 habitual.

371
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:03,904
Actually l`m just borrowing it. l lost mine.

372
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:07,983
lt`s in the evidence bay. lf you want it,
drop by the police station and we`ll swap.

373
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:11,316
- Okay. Promise you won`t arrest me?
- l promise.

374
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:14,489
So why were you crashing my party,
Sgt. Anders?

375
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:17,025
Oh. l didn`t know l needed an invite...

376
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:20,597
Capt. Jack Tuliver,
disgraced Delta Force commando.

377
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:23,791
38 years old. Shall l go on?

378
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:25,232
Very good.

379
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,599
So you got a card in the game.

380
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:31,936
Talk to me, Tuliver.
Everybody else wants you dead.

381
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:34,667
A police officer was killed
in your raid today.

382
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:35,779
Not by me.

383
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:37,676
l`m about the only one that believes you.

384
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:39,078
And why would you believe me?

385
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:41,413
Well, l`ve driven with you, and l survived.

386
00:39:41,518 --> 00:39:43,543
Which is more than l can say for my car.

387
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:46,487
Do you know how long it took me
to save up for that?

388
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:49,891
And l suppose you saved my life.

389
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:56,158
Oh, you`re making me mushy, Sgt. Anders.

390
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:59,133
lt was another gang that hit you,
wasn`t it? Who?

391
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:02,863
Yeah, well, when l find out,
you`ll be the first to know.

392
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:15,384
Any word from your guy?

393
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:22,925
Couldn`t find their own asses after a crap.

394
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,952
Mikhail around?

395
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:51,554
Get lost.

396
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:54,817
Tell him that Tuliver is here.

397
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:29,481
``$1.3 million.``

398
00:41:31,895 --> 00:41:33,226
``$800,000.``

399
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:35,860
``$1.5 million.``

400
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,025
Where did they get $80 million?

401
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:47,203
A $65-million painting?

402
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:53,205
Now, l wonder what kind of case
that would be in, Capt. Tuliver?

403
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:11,134
You shouldn`t have come here.
People want you dead.

404
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:14,795
You wouldn`t happen to know
who`s trying to kill me, would you?

405
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:17,563
Yeah. Me.

406
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:19,699
Oh, shit.

407
00:42:20,177 --> 00:42:23,806
- What did you get Bull into, Tuliver, huh?
- Come on, he came to me.

408
00:42:23,947 --> 00:42:27,383
Bullshit! Bull would have come to me
for a heist.

409
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:31,248
His own brother!
He would have been alive now.

410
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:34,046
- Bull`s dead because of you.
- No, come on! No.

411
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:37,991
Both of my brothers died around you.

412
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:42,293
And you are still alive?
Can you explain that to me?

413
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,737
What?

414
00:42:58,649 --> 00:43:01,277
l lost 12 guys today.

415
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,152
l`ll tell you another thing.

416
00:43:06,857 --> 00:43:11,487
Every time one of your brothers died,
so did l.

417
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:20,770
Tuliver.

418
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:27,610
Where are you going to go, huh?

419
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:30,713
Come on. What are you drinking?

420
00:43:31,882 --> 00:43:34,908
Look. No guns. Okay?

421
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,510
Come on. Let`s drink.

422
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:40,948
Bull came to me.

423
00:43:42,192 --> 00:43:45,252
He met some girl that worked for
an armored car company.

424
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,090
She came to him. He came to me.

425
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,155
That`s it.

426
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:58,533
Delta Force.

427
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:02,405
``Frank `Bull` Mercea.``

428
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,205
Dorothy!

429
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:08,784
Bull Mercea. Buddy of yours, Jack?

430
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:12,288
What, do you bring your own people in
for the job?

431
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:15,187
Married. Bucharest.

432
00:44:19,563 --> 00:44:23,363
Alexsie Kutchinov is
a very dangerous Russian.

433
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,958
He`s put the word out on you.

434
00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:30,102
- l could be killed for just talking to you.
- A gangster?

435
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:33,108
Gangster, a thief, drug dealer.

436
00:44:33,276 --> 00:44:38,077
Covers it all with nightclubs,
art dealership, car dealers...

437
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:42,584
you name it.
lf there is money to be made in this town...

438
00:44:42,686 --> 00:44:45,280
you can be sure he`s got a hand in it.

439
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:51,652
- He`s got a friend of mine.
- Who?

440
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:54,731
The girl.

441
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,556
Jack!

442
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:02,126
Never let a woman
get into your business, Jack.

443
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,500
Tully.

444
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:13,145
Crazy as a shit house rat.

445
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:18,983
l`ve always wondered
what my brothers saw in you.

446
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,929
Both so determined to become
American citizens. For what?

447
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,993
Even worse, that Bull should organize
a heist...

448
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:36,163
and not tell me.

449
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:38,036
lt`s nothing personal, Mik.

450
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:44,907
Stay here tonight.

451
00:45:45,382 --> 00:45:48,681
Andre will take you to a safer place
in the morning.

452
00:45:58,562 --> 00:45:59,654
Hi.

453
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:01,788
l`m sorry to drag you out so early,
Mr. Grapini.

454
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:03,923
Anything to help. Please.

455
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:08,701
So, you found an original van Gogh.
That압 correct, isn앖 it?

456
00:46:08,805 --> 00:46:10,238
Hiemler`s Lily.

457
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:13,038
Hiemler`s Lily?

458
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,008
l bought a consignment of paintings...

459
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:20,242
from a cousin of Hiemler,
Alfred Lindle, a Dutch artist.

460
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,514
l always liked his work. And the bank
wanted money for the debts he owed.

461
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:29,056
They sent me every painting in the house
for one price.

462
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:31,919
The Lily was in with them.

463
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:35,293
l thought it a prank, at first.

464
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:38,460
Well, apparently it is the real thing.

465
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:41,433
- Didn`t Lindle claim it?
- No.

466
00:46:42,505 --> 00:46:45,474
Like the original`s owner,
he took his own life.

467
00:46:47,143 --> 00:46:49,441
That poor painting traveled
all over Europe...

468
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:51,946
to be authenticated
by the insurance company.

469
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:55,484
lt only had one more place to go
before l could show it.

470
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,144
Now it is a ghost again.

471
00:46:59,823 --> 00:47:02,485
- Will the insurance cover it?
- lt is covered.

472
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:06,322
But hopefully we`ll never have to find out.

473
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:11,028
What l can trust is
that you people can do your job.

474
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:12,633
Can you?

475
00:47:13,203 --> 00:47:15,797
Well, it`s always hard
when things are stolen.

476
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:18,067
Young lady, this is not hard.

477
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:21,074
This is a fucking tragedy.

478
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:33,688
l was just thinking about you.
Couldn`t leave me alone, huh, Jack?

479
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,258
Well, l`ve already had my hands
down your pants.

480
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,759
Figured l`d try for second base, Anders.

481
00:47:38,862 --> 00:47:40,853
Well, my door`s open. Come on over.

482
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:42,864
Now, what kind of man you take me for?

483
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:46,231
- A thief in the wrong country.
- Not a killer?

484
00:47:46,336 --> 00:47:48,634
- Convince me.
- Blanks in the gun.

485
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:51,137
Couldn`t have shot him, even if l wanted to.

486
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:53,071
Now, why would you put blanks
in your gun?

487
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,177
Looked like you were shooting
when l saw you.

488
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:59,112
Not at the cop.
And l didn`t put blanks in my gun.

489
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:01,646
Turn yourself in. The evidence will pan out.

490
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:03,616
You didn`t tell them about me yet, did you?

491
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:04,854
What makes you say that?

492
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:07,252
My mug shot`s not plastered
all over the news.

493
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,320
Well, did you mean to steal that case
or was that bonus?

494
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:13,058
Even thieves need to get lucky
every now and then.

495
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,163
What are you in this for, Anders?

496
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,299
l want you all for myself.

497
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,563
What`s in the case?

498
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:23,805
Give me something
and l`ll give you something.

499
00:48:24,975 --> 00:48:26,567
Are we talking about the same thing?

500
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,977
Probably not.

501
00:48:28,078 --> 00:48:31,514
Jack, think long and hard about what
you want from this relationship...

502
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:32,615
and then call me.

503
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:35,952
l will.

504
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,248
l`m starting to like you, Anders.

505
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:44,454
Always leave them hanging.

506
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:09,774
Professor.

507
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:11,620
Yes?

508
00:49:11,755 --> 00:49:14,519
l`m Sgt. Anders, NATO forces,
stationed here in Bucharest.

509
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:15,624
Hello.

510
00:49:15,825 --> 00:49:19,761
Could l ask you a few questions about
a painting you were to have authenticated?

511
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:20,997
Which painting is this?

512
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,359
A possible lost van Gogh.

513
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:23,556
The Lilies in the Field?

514
00:49:27,804 --> 00:49:28,828
The painting is a fake.

515
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,570
lt`s not that l don`t believe you, sir.

516
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:35,433
How can you be so sure when...

517
00:49:35,578 --> 00:49:37,944
two other reputable art appraisers
think it`s real.

518
00:49:38,281 --> 00:49:39,305
To the trained eye...

519
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:42,612
it`s obvious that the brush strokes
were not those of the master.

520
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:45,213
The painting lacks texture, nuance...

521
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:48,316
and the familiar pastichal brilliance.

522
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:50,048
- So, it`s forgery?
- Yes.

523
00:49:50,226 --> 00:49:51,625
Credible attempt, but...

524
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:52,895
nonetheless...

525
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,296
a forgery.

526
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:57,560
Now, if you`ll excuse me, Sgt. Anders.

527
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:39,272
Nothing personal, Tully.

528
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:40,910
Just business.

529
00:50:42,312 --> 00:50:43,279
Oh, you cocksucker.

530
00:50:44,314 --> 00:50:45,281
Your little job...

531
00:50:45,915 --> 00:50:47,746
has put us all in danger.

532
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:50,377
This man would be very upset with me...

533
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:51,713
if l helped you.

534
00:50:52,222 --> 00:50:53,189
Mikhail...

535
00:50:53,456 --> 00:50:55,356
who do you think killed Bull, huh?

536
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,325
Who do you think?

537
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:01,623
So, sore Tuliver...

538
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,328
we have a saying in my country:

539
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:06,558
``Don`t blame the baker...

540
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,505
``when the butcher bakes the bread.``

541
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:14,208
What the hell does that mean?

542
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:16,511
lt means you are fucked.

543
00:51:18,414 --> 00:51:20,882
So, you had no idea
what was in the package?

544
00:51:21,151 --> 00:51:23,085
Have you ever done courier work?

545
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,712
- No.
- No.

546
00:51:25,021 --> 00:51:27,080
A client pays for a package to be delivered...

547
00:51:27,724 --> 00:51:28,782
we deliver.

548
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:30,359
And where was it going?

549
00:51:30,994 --> 00:51:32,291
To the destination.

550
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:34,921
Destination was...

551
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:37,795
a Dr. Bostnescu, here in Bucharest.

552
00:51:40,436 --> 00:51:41,767
You could be more helpful.

553
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:43,105
l am.

554
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:45,902
Do you have an armed assault
and robbery charge against you?

555
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:47,009
Acquitted.

556
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:49,512
And what has that got to do with anything?

557
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:51,310
Nothing really...

558
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:52,809
just being thorough.

559
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:56,875
Would hate to think of a man with counts of
armed assault against him would have...

560
00:51:56,986 --> 00:52:00,820
any knowledge of a $65-million painting
going missing on his watch.

561
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:08,762
My cell number.

562
00:52:08,998 --> 00:52:11,228
Call me if you think of anything useful.

563
00:52:12,936 --> 00:52:14,335
Don`t get up.

564
00:52:21,344 --> 00:52:22,311
Follow her.

565
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:52,932
What did he say?

566
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,799
Go with God.

567
00:52:56,412 --> 00:52:57,606
Sister fucker.

568
00:53:00,283 --> 00:53:01,341
Wake him.

569
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:19,628
No sleep for the wicked, Jack.

570
00:53:23,606 --> 00:53:26,131
There must be something really big
in that case.

571
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:29,673
Oh, that`s frightening, Tuliver.

572
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,979
You can read minds.

573
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:34,982
lf l`m dead...

574
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:37,812
no case.

575
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,709
l`ll be just one minute.

576
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:03,735
Make yourself at home.

577
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,177
Dorothy!

578
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,674
Do you know where Jack Tuliver is?

579
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:45,078
He`s wanted for the murder of
a police officer.

580
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:48,080
Jack can kill, but he`s no killer.

581
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:51,283
Grapini...

582
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:54,887
made this job sound so much easier...

583
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:56,930
than it turned out.

584
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:01,392
Get someone to steal the casino money.

585
00:55:02,305 --> 00:55:03,272
Oops.

586
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,236
$65-million painting...

587
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:10,768
disappears.

588
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:14,316
Oh, yes.

589
00:55:15,985 --> 00:55:17,714
lt is a painting, Jack...

590
00:55:19,055 --> 00:55:21,114
and l need that painting.

591
00:55:23,793 --> 00:55:24,760
You see...

592
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:27,524
it would be very bad for me...

593
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:30,756
if that painting was to show up...

594
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:34,126
and everyone realized...

595
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,630
it was a fake.

596
00:55:40,143 --> 00:55:42,373
How will l get my insurance money then...

597
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:44,004
Jack?

598
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,048
How many people in this photo
will die this week?

599
00:55:53,423 --> 00:55:54,890
Why did Jack go to prison?

600
00:55:55,925 --> 00:55:58,018
You see the other man next to Jack?

601
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:00,921
Constantine was Bull`s brother.

602
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:03,531
They were in the military with Jack.

603
00:56:05,201 --> 00:56:07,260
Constantine Mercea died for his country.

604
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:12,632
A military officer sent Constantine
on a suicidal mission.

605
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:13,742
And he died.

606
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,240
Jack broke that officer압 arm and leg...

607
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,304
then stole a helicopter...

608
00:56:19,515 --> 00:56:22,848
flew into the local town to have
a drink to his friend압 memory.

609
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:25,551
Eight MPs were sent to get him.

610
00:56:26,189 --> 00:56:27,781
Four ended up in the hospital.

611
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:32,250
Tuliver did four years in Leavenworth
for that one night.

612
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:38,861
Jack went to jail...

613
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:41,262
and Bull came home.

614
00:56:49,979 --> 00:56:51,469
How did they get into this?

615
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:53,849
l don`t know.

616
00:56:54,617 --> 00:56:55,845
lt was that girl...

617
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:57,419
Suza.

618
00:56:58,387 --> 00:56:59,354
Suza?

619
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,090
How was she, Tuliver?

620
00:57:09,765 --> 00:57:11,995
Just another girl in another city?

621
00:57:15,705 --> 00:57:18,606
What would you do for
a team member, Jack.

622
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:22,843
Are you a team player?

623
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:25,981
No!

624
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:33,079
Come on.

625
00:57:34,724 --> 00:57:36,214
You don`t have to do that.

626
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:39,350
Jeez.

627
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,766
She came to Bull to set up a job.

628
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,135
lt was too big for Bull.

629
00:57:49,805 --> 00:57:51,830
So they called in Tuliver?

630
00:57:55,912 --> 00:57:57,345
l`m sorry for your loss.

631
00:57:58,648 --> 00:57:59,615
Who is this?

632
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,518
That`s Bull`s other brother, Mikhail.

633
00:58:03,386 --> 00:58:04,717
He owns a nightclub.

634
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:16,488
Hello, Mikhail.

635
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:18,033
Nice car.

636
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,168
Nice new car.

637
00:58:21,771 --> 00:58:23,739
Are you an accessory that comes with it?

638
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,366
Funny you should say that.

639
00:58:25,575 --> 00:58:26,542
Say what?

640
00:58:26,676 --> 00:58:27,665
Accessory.

641
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:30,369
Jack Tuliver`s accessory.

642
00:58:34,984 --> 00:58:35,951
Wanna dance?

643
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:44,626
Suza.

644
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,803
They`re going to kill me.

645
00:58:57,206 --> 00:58:58,730
l can`t do this much longer.

646
00:59:00,843 --> 00:59:03,368
But if l talk, we are dead.

647
00:59:03,846 --> 00:59:05,074
l`m so sorry, Jack.

648
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,084
lt wasn`t meant to be like this.

649
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:12,912
lt was gonna be so easy.

650
00:59:15,224 --> 00:59:17,158
We were all gonna go to the beach.

651
00:59:18,361 --> 00:59:19,988
Spanky sold us down the crapper.

652
00:59:20,796 --> 00:59:21,763
No...

653
00:59:23,165 --> 00:59:24,689
they have him upstairs.

654
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:29,972
Jack...

655
00:59:30,573 --> 00:59:31,562
just tell them.

656
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:34,033
lf l do, you are dead.

657
00:59:34,877 --> 00:59:38,176
You haven`t heard Spanky scream for
the last 24 hours.

658
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:40,108
They are relentless.

659
00:59:41,317 --> 00:59:43,808
l`d sooner die quick with a bullet
than like this.

660
00:59:45,121 --> 00:59:47,487
l can`t die like this.

661
00:59:47,957 --> 00:59:50,221
l can`t.

662
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:58,965
No, l have not seen Jack Tuliver
for a long time.

663
00:59:59,669 --> 01:00:01,159
l`ve seen that man before.

664
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:04,606
Recently?

665
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:07,442
He`s in a picture in a house.

666
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:13,179
Standing next to Tuliver, who did four years
in Leavenworth when he died.

667
01:00:13,983 --> 01:00:14,950
Now...

668
01:00:16,285 --> 01:00:17,513
if l was Jack...

669
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:20,481
and was in trouble with a gang
who busted my heist...

670
01:00:20,656 --> 01:00:23,523
and every policeman in the city
thinks l shot a cop...

671
01:00:24,493 --> 01:00:25,983
l would come here.

672
01:00:27,663 --> 01:00:31,360
So, you think you know Jack pretty well?

673
01:00:33,169 --> 01:00:35,034
How does that happen?

674
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:39,429
How does a good-looking police officer
like you...

675
01:00:39,942 --> 01:00:43,969
give a shit about a dirty bank robber
like Jack Tuliver?

676
01:00:44,547 --> 01:00:45,514
He`s my alibi.

677
01:00:49,085 --> 01:00:52,486
Have you ever met
the art dealer from whom...

678
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,020
Grapini gets his art?

679
01:00:55,558 --> 01:00:56,616
Who?

680
01:00:57,259 --> 01:00:59,921
l should make his acquaintance
if l were you.

681
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,463
But take my advice...

682
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:04,465
have a gun nearby...

683
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:05,891
when you do.

684
01:01:06,502 --> 01:01:09,096
He`s not as friendly as me.

685
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:10,729
Give me a name.

686
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:14,843
l see.

687
01:01:19,381 --> 01:01:20,405
Thank you.

688
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,207
Sergei.

689
01:02:00,422 --> 01:02:02,481
Come on.

690
01:02:07,463 --> 01:02:08,430
Embarrassing.

691
01:02:12,434 --> 01:02:13,401
You see...

692
01:02:14,837 --> 01:02:15,826
patience.

693
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:22,608
Okay, l`ll take you to it.

694
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:29,910
You think l am stupid man, Jack?

695
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:33,981
You think a man who would
cut his own throat shaving...

696
01:02:34,423 --> 01:02:38,382
could run the largest pugata
in this entire shitty country!

697
01:02:41,397 --> 01:02:42,523
Cutthroat world?

698
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:44,724
Stupid man?

699
01:02:45,734 --> 01:02:46,701
Hit him.

700
01:02:47,136 --> 01:02:48,899
No, please. Don`t, please.

701
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:53,741
Look, it`s in a...

702
01:02:54,643 --> 01:02:57,703
locker in the train station.
The locker has no number.

703
01:02:59,748 --> 01:03:01,215
l`ll take you to it.

704
01:03:02,284 --> 01:03:03,774
And why you take me?

705
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:06,516
So you can try to escape?

706
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:09,424
One of my men here kills you...

707
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:12,019
l lose my case.

708
01:03:15,197 --> 01:03:16,630
l hid the key.

709
01:03:19,368 --> 01:03:21,199
``l hid the key``?

710
01:03:23,038 --> 01:03:24,005
Funny.

711
01:03:25,407 --> 01:03:27,875
l`ll tell you what, Tuliver.

712
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,543
Tomorrow morning...

713
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:31,111
you will get the key.

714
01:03:31,714 --> 01:03:33,511
And you will bring me my case.

715
01:03:36,919 --> 01:03:38,318
Or the penalty...

716
01:03:38,721 --> 01:03:40,382
of her death...

717
01:03:41,657 --> 01:03:43,716
will be so much worse...

718
01:03:44,727 --> 01:03:46,991
than the death itself.

719
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,697
Sweet dreams, Jack.

720
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:34,471
No warrant. Nice, Kelly.

721
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:49,849
Eastern European art.

722
01:04:52,628 --> 01:04:54,061
Acquisitions.

723
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:04,938
Thanks, honey.

724
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:17,307
Pretty, now.

725
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:19,452
What, you want a date?

726
01:05:20,689 --> 01:05:23,351
Maybe your friend over here
might be a better choice.

727
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,628
You no laughing soon, funny man.

728
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:33,735
You really don`t like me, do you?

729
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:36,962
No.

730
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:43,744
lt`s over there.

731
01:05:46,648 --> 01:05:47,637
After you.

732
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,787
Key.

733
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:55,650
Untie my hands, l`ll give it to you. Oh, yeah.

734
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:58,090
- No more games.
- Okay. All right.

735
01:05:58,794 --> 01:06:00,762
lt`s in the top locker. Over there.

736
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:03,531
Yeah.

737
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:11,606
Don`t slip.

738
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:17,236
- Goat fucker?
- lgnore him. Get the key.

739
01:06:17,379 --> 01:06:18,346
Get the key.

740
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,517
Get the key.

741
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:25,949
l`m gonna fucking kill you.

742
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,995
Let me hear your smart mouth now,
you motherfucker.

743
01:06:34,163 --> 01:06:35,460
What are you gonna do, huh?

744
01:06:35,564 --> 01:06:38,761
- What, you gonna beat me with your shoes?
- No. With the gun!

745
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,393
You`re so fucking clever, huh?

746
01:06:41,637 --> 01:06:43,434
Learned a few bad words, huh?

747
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:47,631
Get the case,
and you can buggerfuck him until Sunday.

748
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:49,337
lf it makes you happy.

749
01:06:49,478 --> 01:06:50,809
You think l would do that?

750
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:52,313
l am a man.

751
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:54,912
l don`t like men.

752
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:58,114
He makes you angry and you...

753
01:06:58,587 --> 01:06:59,611
act like schoolgirl!

754
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:01,188
Schoolgirl? Schoolgirl?

755
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:02,687
l give you school--

756
01:07:39,862 --> 01:07:41,762
l told them it was in my left pocket.

757
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:54,171
So what makes Alexsie Kutchinov
so interesting, Mikhail?

758
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:01,950
Got you.

759
01:08:17,766 --> 01:08:19,700
Are you sure she helped him out?

760
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:22,229
Well, you`ll save on dropping the case.

761
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,565
l want that little bitch taken care of.

762
01:08:45,227 --> 01:08:47,127
Well, gentlemen.

763
01:08:58,774 --> 01:08:59,741
Problems?

764
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:01,376
Yes.

765
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:13,621
Get her.

766
01:09:52,427 --> 01:09:53,951
Never know until you try.

767
01:09:58,066 --> 01:09:59,966
l was wondering what happened to you.

768
01:10:00,502 --> 01:10:03,403
Anders, still got those panties on l like?

769
01:10:03,972 --> 01:10:06,065
l`m wearing just a smile for you, Jack.

770
01:10:06,942 --> 01:10:08,307
Still got my painting?

771
01:10:08,477 --> 01:10:10,445
All of this is for a damn painting?

772
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:17,117
Well, it better not be one of them sad
clown paintings, `cause l hate those things.

773
01:10:21,423 --> 01:10:23,050
Talking of sad clowns...

774
01:10:23,825 --> 01:10:26,521
you`re a good-looking man, Jack.
Do you know that?

775
01:10:26,828 --> 01:10:27,795
Gotta go.

776
01:10:28,997 --> 01:10:30,521
- What?
- Nothing.

777
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:32,990
Always a pleasure, Anders.

778
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:35,535
Gotta run. Places to go, people to kill.

779
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:47,812
Hi, Jack. Missed you.

780
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:49,678
What are you doing, stalking me?

781
01:10:49,785 --> 01:10:52,049
- Phone sex isn`t illegal in Romania.
- No...

782
01:10:52,654 --> 01:10:54,121
but armed robbery is.

783
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:57,524
And if that was sex...

784
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,286
only one of us was satisfied.

785
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,722
Boy, do you need a boyfriend.

786
01:11:03,165 --> 01:11:04,132
Come with me.

787
01:11:04,499 --> 01:11:05,966
l`m taking applications.

788
01:11:10,639 --> 01:11:12,004
You kill the artist...

789
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:14,435
buy his paintings and slip it in with them...

790
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:17,545
threaten the appraisers,
maybe even have Alexsie kill one.

791
01:11:17,646 --> 01:11:18,613
What was his name again?

792
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,338
Gustav, Dr. Gustav.

793
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:22,142
That`s right. Dr. Gustav.

794
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:25,352
l didn`t kill the artist. He shot himself.

795
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:28,022
And l did find it in his paintings.

796
01:11:29,825 --> 01:11:31,725
You better tell him the truth, you know...

797
01:11:31,827 --> 01:11:33,886
when he wigs out like this, l can`t--

798
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:35,427
There is no Lily in the Field.

799
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:38,897
lt`s a fucking myth like Bigfoot
or the Loch Ness Monster.

800
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:41,530
The painting`s a fake, isn`t it?

801
01:11:42,337 --> 01:11:44,100
You set this whole thing up.

802
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,207
So what then?

803
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:48,468
Split the insurance money with Alexsie?

804
01:11:50,412 --> 01:11:51,879
So what do you do now, huh?

805
01:11:58,653 --> 01:11:59,620
Talk to me.

806
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:02,314
l`m the only friend you`ve got.

807
01:12:02,424 --> 01:12:03,891
You watch too much TV.

808
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:08,227
There`s no evidence, no witnesses,
and not a brain in this room.

809
01:12:09,765 --> 01:12:11,062
l want my lawyer.

810
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:12,734
ldiots.

811
01:12:14,403 --> 01:12:16,769
The boys will be back soon
with my painting.

812
01:12:18,673 --> 01:12:21,335
$20 million in bags downstairs.

813
01:12:22,577 --> 01:12:23,805
And a dead thief.

814
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:28,276
How will your life change after that?

815
01:12:29,885 --> 01:12:31,113
Little Suza?

816
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,688
My gun, my phone, and the painting.

817
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,150
The gun is gone.

818
01:12:36,258 --> 01:12:39,455
The phone is in my pocket.
You could reach in there if you want it.

819
01:12:39,561 --> 01:12:42,928
Now, you are not a straight-talking man,
so why should l believe you?

820
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:44,430
Well, l didn`t lie to you.

821
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:46,558
l just didn`t tell you all the facts.

822
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:49,159
You know, l have a begrudging respect
for you, Tuliver.

823
01:12:49,271 --> 01:12:50,738
You get a lead, gather a team...

824
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:53,467
and pull off one
of the most daring robberies in history.

825
01:12:53,608 --> 01:12:55,098
Don`t ruin it by me killing you.

826
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:57,211
Look, do you wanna be a hero or not?

827
01:12:58,046 --> 01:12:59,343
You`re negotiating?

828
01:12:59,815 --> 01:13:00,907
l will arrest you...

829
01:13:01,016 --> 01:13:03,177
l will clear my name and l`ll make lieutenant.

830
01:13:03,285 --> 01:13:05,185
Then you`re gonna have to phone me
in prison.

831
01:13:05,287 --> 01:13:08,154
Maybe you might like
a relationship like that, l don`t.

832
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,158
Look, l don`t give two shits
about that painting.

833
01:13:11,259 --> 01:13:13,887
There are people in there
who are relying on me.

834
01:13:14,062 --> 01:13:15,825
They`re gonna die if l don`t help them.

835
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:17,831
lt`s not your concern. lt`s a police matter.

836
01:13:17,933 --> 01:13:18,900
What?

837
01:13:20,535 --> 01:13:23,504
Romanian police, right? Highly unlikely.

838
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:25,298
l`m getting out of this car.

839
01:13:25,474 --> 01:13:27,806
Not without a bullet
in your body, you`re not.

840
01:13:28,043 --> 01:13:29,510
Sgt. Anders, listen...

841
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:31,637
l get my friends...

842
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,613
you get the painting,
and you can keep all the money.

843
01:13:34,983 --> 01:13:38,077
But if we wait for Romanian police,
it`s all gonna disappear.

844
01:13:38,887 --> 01:13:40,582
With a whole lot of bullets.

845
01:13:45,427 --> 01:13:46,826
Lt. Anders, huh?

846
01:13:48,897 --> 01:13:50,057
Sounds pretty good.

847
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,295
You must be betting l`m some kind of idiot.

848
01:13:54,669 --> 01:13:56,102
l hate betting.

849
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:02,734
Never leave a man or woman in the field.

850
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:04,745
Old habits.

851
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:06,848
Shit!

852
01:14:08,216 --> 01:14:09,774
What am l, chopped liver?

853
01:14:09,985 --> 01:14:12,078
Tuliver, going in unarmed?

854
01:14:20,295 --> 01:14:22,422
Not gonna do much good
if they aim for the head.

855
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:23,930
Well, l can duck.

856
01:14:27,035 --> 01:14:28,002
Firstly...

857
01:14:28,503 --> 01:14:29,731
l come with you.

858
01:14:29,938 --> 01:14:30,962
All right. Second?

859
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:32,061
Secondly...

860
01:14:32,574 --> 01:14:35,475
don`t ever make the mistake of thinking
l won`t shoot you.

861
01:14:37,412 --> 01:14:39,243
Look, this ain`t target practice...

862
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:41,215
these guys are serious.

863
01:14:41,349 --> 01:14:42,577
They will kill you.

864
01:14:42,784 --> 01:14:44,376
Just get us inside, Rambo.

865
01:14:44,486 --> 01:14:46,249
Let me worry about the dying bit.

866
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:01,667
You should see this for yourself.

867
01:15:09,544 --> 01:15:10,511
How many?

868
01:15:11,413 --> 01:15:12,573
About five plus.

869
01:15:13,214 --> 01:15:14,977
All right. How do we get in?

870
01:15:17,118 --> 01:15:18,085
Quietly.

871
01:15:19,187 --> 01:15:20,279
You wait here...

872
01:15:20,722 --> 01:15:22,485
till l get inside, okay?

873
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:25,759
Don`t shoot until l do.

874
01:15:26,227 --> 01:15:27,194
And...

875
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:29,622
try to aim and hit them, not me.

876
01:15:33,702 --> 01:15:35,067
Don`t get shot, Jack.

877
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,569
l need you breathing.

878
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,230
See, you do care.

879
01:15:57,092 --> 01:15:58,354
Oh, shit!

880
01:17:05,727 --> 01:17:06,819
Fuck!

881
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:35,256
Hey!

882
01:18:27,075 --> 01:18:29,236
No!

883
01:19:28,303 --> 01:19:29,531
l know where Jack is.

884
01:20:06,841 --> 01:20:08,502
Fuck! Psych!

885
01:20:50,418 --> 01:20:51,476
Jack!

886
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:02,062
Tuliver.

887
01:21:02,397 --> 01:21:03,364
Thank God.

888
01:21:04,732 --> 01:21:05,926
They almost got me.

889
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:07,963
l had the drop on them.

890
01:21:08,069 --> 01:21:10,435
l was gonna give it to them, Spanky Foo.

891
01:21:13,174 --> 01:21:14,141
Go!

892
01:21:19,881 --> 01:21:20,848
Fuck.

893
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:28,022
lt`s okay.

894
01:21:31,826 --> 01:21:32,793
Jack.

895
01:21:35,163 --> 01:21:38,860
- Macking with the hos, JT?
- Macking the 9 mm, dick.

896
01:21:40,802 --> 01:21:41,769
Oh, no.

897
01:21:46,341 --> 01:21:47,808
- Go.
- Thanks.

898
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:51,778
Thanks, J.T. Thanks, mate.

899
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:57,851
Let`s go.

900
01:22:24,645 --> 01:22:26,374
You are persistent, Jack.

901
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:30,076
You brought the cavalry.

902
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:34,481
Well, you know...

903
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:36,147
you shoot her, we shoot you.

904
01:22:36,491 --> 01:22:37,924
Who wins, Alexsie?

905
01:22:38,393 --> 01:22:40,827
l may have the gun pointed
at her pretty head...

906
01:22:41,062 --> 01:22:42,552
but l can`t be sure...

907
01:22:42,663 --> 01:22:44,893
l can stop from pulling the trigger.

908
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,690
l have a problem...

909
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:48,232
you might have noticed.

910
01:22:48,469 --> 01:22:49,766
Being a psychopath?

911
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:53,299
You must be Jack`s other girl.

912
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:55,798
Nice job.

913
01:23:02,517 --> 01:23:04,144
You have to save her, Jack.

914
01:23:05,987 --> 01:23:07,420
Drop the fucking gun, now.

915
01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:08,750
You drop the gun...

916
01:23:09,557 --> 01:23:11,525
or l blow her fucking head off!

917
01:23:11,926 --> 01:23:12,893
Now!

918
01:23:13,895 --> 01:23:15,362
l mean it, Jack!

919
01:23:16,764 --> 01:23:18,061
Do it, Jack!

920
01:23:28,776 --> 01:23:30,243
Now kick it over.

921
01:23:30,778 --> 01:23:31,802
Kick it!

922
01:23:34,215 --> 01:23:35,443
Now move back.

923
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,242
Back, Jack.

924
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:40,016
You see...

925
01:23:40,621 --> 01:23:41,986
it is easy.

926
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,131
Game over, Jack.

927
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,143
l`m sorry.

928
01:24:05,947 --> 01:24:06,914
You set me up?

929
01:24:07,181 --> 01:24:09,081
Jack!

930
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,048
You set us all up.

931
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:18,989
All of them died because of you.

932
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:20,987
You killed Bull.

933
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:26,260
Fucking bitch.

934
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:28,396
Well, that`s your problem, Jack.

935
01:24:29,103 --> 01:24:31,833
You always think for everyone else
and not for yourself.

936
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:33,634
l don`t want...

937
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:35,934
a five-way split and a beach hut.

938
01:24:37,178 --> 01:24:38,475
l want a two-way split.

939
01:24:39,514 --> 01:24:42,483
That`s a cool $25 mil, with the painting.

940
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:45,509
l just needed someone to steal it for us.

941
01:24:46,154 --> 01:24:47,951
Wait, no.

942
01:24:48,456 --> 01:24:49,821
But l heard you scream.

943
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,384
Sometimes love is painful.

944
01:24:53,494 --> 01:24:55,962
Especially when you need to know
where that case is.

945
01:24:56,964 --> 01:24:58,124
Costly case, that.

946
01:24:59,133 --> 01:25:02,625
Just point him in the right direction
and he is twice the man you are, Jack.

947
01:25:03,337 --> 01:25:04,964
All drive and passion.

948
01:25:06,073 --> 01:25:07,438
No fake orgasms here.

949
01:25:09,043 --> 01:25:11,204
Maybe l`ll not be an art dealer anymore.

950
01:25:12,313 --> 01:25:14,679
A man has to stick to what he is good at.

951
01:25:18,486 --> 01:25:19,453
Well...

952
01:25:21,189 --> 01:25:22,486
where is my case?

953
01:25:28,529 --> 01:25:29,962
l won`t ask twice, Jack.

954
01:25:34,335 --> 01:25:35,666
lt`s in my car.

955
01:25:36,337 --> 01:25:37,304
See?

956
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,563
That wasn`t so hard now, was it?

957
01:25:51,852 --> 01:25:54,286
Never let a woman in your business.

958
01:25:55,623 --> 01:25:56,590
Oh, shit!

959
01:25:58,226 --> 01:25:59,193
Mikhail.

960
01:25:59,427 --> 01:26:00,485
Oh, shit, indeed.

961
01:26:02,063 --> 01:26:03,189
This is for Bull.

962
01:26:11,138 --> 01:26:12,696
Now we`re even, Jack.

963
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:16,269
Anders, want a ride?

964
01:26:17,878 --> 01:26:19,607
Show some appreciation...

965
01:26:19,714 --> 01:26:21,181
for the man that saved you.

966
01:26:21,415 --> 01:26:22,382
l have a ride.

967
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:25,748
Save somebody`s life
and that`s the gratitude.

968
01:26:28,389 --> 01:26:29,356
No!

969
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,259
Now we`re even.

970
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:44,762
Obviously, l`m coming with you.

971
01:27:15,202 --> 01:27:17,102
Oh, no. Please, not this again.

972
01:27:40,061 --> 01:27:41,050
Shit!

973
01:27:41,862 --> 01:27:43,454
Excuse me, l have just been shot.

974
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:55,804
That`s got to hurt.

975
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:04,716
Move!

976
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:07,913
Shit!

977
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,638
- You`re a lunatic.
- Probably.

978
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:29,292
You have been most uncooperative, Mikhail.

979
01:29:29,804 --> 01:29:31,533
Told you, l know nothing.

980
01:29:31,705 --> 01:29:34,105
Police picked you up in a house
with a dozen dead bodies.

981
01:29:34,241 --> 01:29:35,799
With a bullet hole in your own leg.

982
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,634
Yet you say you know nothing.

983
01:29:37,778 --> 01:29:38,904
Don`t bullshit me.

984
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:41,514
Maybe a little time in jail might help him to...

985
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:43,710
refresh his memory.

986
01:29:44,318 --> 01:29:45,285
She`s dead.

987
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:48,314
lf she`s dead...

988
01:29:50,324 --> 01:29:51,882
why did we not find her body?

989
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:54,255
These were professionals, Captain.

990
01:29:54,929 --> 01:29:57,796
Professionals don`t leave
dead cops for forensic evidence.

991
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:00,357
You`ll never find Anders.

992
01:30:01,368 --> 01:30:03,700
Unless you drain the entire Black Sea.

993
01:30:04,538 --> 01:30:06,768
Beautiful, worthless souvenir.

994
01:30:09,143 --> 01:30:10,508
Ready for a swim, Shit Bag?

995
01:30:11,212 --> 01:30:13,510
Do l look like l`m ready for a swim?

996
01:30:13,814 --> 01:30:15,748
l mean, l like the lake...

997
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,779
but when are we gonna go to the beach?

998
01:30:17,885 --> 01:30:19,546
We can`t afford to be at the beach.

999
01:30:20,287 --> 01:30:22,448
The beach, the beach.

1000
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:25,255
There is nothing better than coming home...

1001
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:27,820
after a long, hard day at work...

1002
01:30:27,995 --> 01:30:30,225
and sticking your feet in the hot sand...

1003
01:30:31,632 --> 01:30:32,599
and...

1004
01:30:33,634 --> 01:30:35,261
And, and, and what?

1005
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,369
What if it`s not a fake?

1006
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:39,239
The painting?

1007
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:41,634
lt is a fake.

1008
01:30:41,976 --> 01:30:44,536
l mean, we could sell it back to
the insurance company.

1009
01:30:44,678 --> 01:30:46,475
No questions asked, $20 million.

1010
01:30:47,515 --> 01:30:48,607
lt is...

1011
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:50,083
a fake.

1012
01:30:52,219 --> 01:30:53,516
Excuse me, do you speak German?

1013
01:30:53,988 --> 01:30:55,421
- English?
- English.

1014
01:30:55,756 --> 01:30:57,018
Can l help you?

1015
01:30:58,425 --> 01:31:01,451
Yes, l`m looking for Sgt. Kelly Anders.

1016
01:31:02,096 --> 01:31:03,358
l can help you.

1017
01:31:08,202 --> 01:31:09,692
My name is Franz Gustav.

1018
01:31:09,937 --> 01:31:11,427
- Dr. Franz Gustav?
- Yes.

1019
01:31:12,673 --> 01:31:14,368
You authenticated the van Gogh?

1020
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:15,609
Yes.

1021
01:31:16,477 --> 01:31:18,672
When l heard that Mark Van der Mer died...

1022
01:31:19,446 --> 01:31:20,413
l panicked.

1023
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,685
l thought l would be next.

1024
01:31:28,856 --> 01:31:31,290
l`ve never been involved
in anything like this before.

1025
01:31:32,126 --> 01:31:33,184
So...

1026
01:31:33,294 --> 01:31:34,591
it is a fake?

1027
01:31:36,764 --> 01:31:37,731
Oh, no.

1028
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:39,963
ln my opinion...

1029
01:31:40,301 --> 01:31:41,700
it`s the real thing.

1030
01:31:50,611 --> 01:31:52,044
Read the newspapers today?

1031
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,003
What newspapers?

1032
01:32:15,069 --> 01:32:17,230
Tuliver, you lucky bastard!

1033
01:32:23,043 --> 01:32:24,340
Jack.

1034
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:26,804
What newspapers?

1035
01:32:27,848 --> 01:32:29,475
- Got to read, baby.
- You better tell--

1036
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:31,574
Got to read, you gotta read more.
