FEIVELYNE YOLANDA YAFFA

2
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:39,256
After having sailed a perilous trip, 
I enjoyed again a quiet life. 

3
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:45,220
But soon I was tired and longed
for oceans and adventure. 

4
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:49,850
= = The report on my fifth trip begins here. 

5
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,582
MANY YEARS LATER

6
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:31,731
A very familiar scent of darkness and evil filled the air. 

7
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,693
I can not even hear voices.

8
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:42,784
It is... black magic, Captain Sinbad.

9
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:46,621
We die if we go ashore.

10
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:53,127
-Let's Sail away from this place.
-We Should leave the port.

11
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:58,799
We do not know yet.
I am going to the palace.

12
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:40,340
-Zohreh! What happened?
-Take Your men with. We advocate.

13
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,009
NIGHT BEFORE

14
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,770
Sultan was like a father to me,
and the princess was my life. 

15
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:37,562
For His transcendent majesty and his hip

16
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:41,232
-Let me introduce wizard Hassan.

17
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:55,663
Their famous and unique Majesties.

18
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:59,124
I am honored being called to Maleks court.

19
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,045
Tonight I will give one forestilling-

20
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:07,799
-which gives thrill of joy of everyone who sees it.

21
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,523
This little box contains nothing but sand from my home.

22
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:29,445
But see how it shows us pictures from a reality in our time.

23
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:47,021
It was really amazing.

24
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:51,316
Tell Hassan how you perform such magic tricks?

25
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,531
-And What's in the box?
-Your Majesty, I promise...

26
00:08:57,614 --> 00:09:01,284
... that the box contains only sand from my home.

27
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:07,457
But you must allow this humble sorcerer its secrets.

28
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,252
Humble? Do not be so modest.

29
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:18,384
My advisors say that you have amazing abilities, and it looks Mon.

30
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:25,600
My friend, I promise that you will be richly rewarded
at the end of this evening.

31
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:29,478
I am not in doubt Your Majesty.

32
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:35,234
With your permission, 
I will show my tricks for prinsessen-

33
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:39,989
-to celebrate her upcoming marriage with Captain Sinbad.

34
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:46,453
I wonder why he did not participate in this festive evening.

35
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:54,419
We sailed for many days and nights - 

36
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:59,841
-until we finally came to a large, uninhabited island. 

37
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:03,261
I thought we in any case. 

38
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:05,004
I can not leave the island without amulet Goddess.

39
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:58,181
It was a little too personally!

40
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:58,781
We have lots of gold and jewels.
What is so special about the amulet?

41
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:05,079
It must be my wedding to the princess. 
She dreamed of it.

42
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:09,333
And now you will meet her dreams.

43
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,921
Men give flowers.
I give magical amulets.

44
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,427
I wish that you did not waste
invisibility gift at a wedding.

45
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,264
You speak like a true thief, Firoozeh.

46
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,934
We sail for home.

47
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:44,200
With your permission, 
I will show my tricks for prinsessen-

48
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:49,038
-to celebrate her upcoming marriage with Captain Sinbad.

49
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:55,670
I wonder why he do not participate in this festive evening.

50
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:59,381
-V?rsgo.
-Prinsesse.

51
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:16,148
I can only imagine one thing which is a beautiful princess worthy.

52
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:22,863
Heaven.

53
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:29,828
For you, my butterfly.

54
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,795
I wish that this momentcould last an eternity.

55
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:43,007
Your Majesty has his way.

56
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,864
Parisa!

57
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,580
Parisa!

58
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:37,351
Follow me and take your men with.

59
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:49,155
-Zohreh, What happened?
-Do You life amulet with?

60
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:51,949
Give us the amulet.

61
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:59,248
But Parisa said that gave invisibility gift.

62
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,334
Her dream is not easily decipherable.

63
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:07,798
There is a reason it is called life amulet.

64
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:25,648
-Forr?deri!
-Your Highness. Zohreh told everything.

65
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:28,985
I'm afraid that he has taken her.

66
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:33,614
He is not interested in Parisas body.

67
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:40,079
It is her soul, he seeks.
He ??called the white deeve.

68
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:47,211
He is a dark wizard,
who drink the innocent souls.

69
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:50,631
If he steals the princess's soul...

70
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:55,886
... it would be better,
if she had never been born.

71
00:17:55,969 --> 00:18:03,101
Where is this white deeve?
-On A large island called Masejonia.

72
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:07,022
It is a gloomy place.

73
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:11,484
The Witch explained
that I was the sultan's only hope - 

74
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:18,408
-and that I should travel to the
black desert within 40 days and nights. 

75
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:47,978
= = As we sailed into the unknown, was
thoughts about the princess everything I had. 

76
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:41,905
-Sinbad ship is almost ready.
-Is It?

77
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:50,831
I can never be together.
Learn to accept it.

78
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:55,710
None princess of Malek can love
an ordinary man. Such is the law.

79
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:06,471
There he is again!
Every day at the same place...

80
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:12,310
-... staring like a hungry dog.
-I Think about how he looks at me.

81
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:15,229
Guards, lower me down.

82
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:19,942
Do not worry, Zohreh.
The guards will protect me.

83
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:23,654
The guards are men.

84
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:28,409
None of them protects your virtue,
as I do, princess.

85
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:36,416
From now on you must think of
that you are a princess.

86
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:43,048
If you are determined
losing your head...

87
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,852
Who is calling me?

88
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,567
My eyes two watching the sea,
but on the beach he has an eye. 

89
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,696
Only with the heart that one can be free. 

90
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,866
"My eyes two watching the sea. "

91
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:22,394
My ship sank to the ocean floor. 

92
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:31,862
binoculars.

93
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:03,742
Is there anything on this island,
are not gigantic?

94
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,711
-In Fools, I do not know what you do.
-We Are starving.

95
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:18,465
Hungry men do not ask.
Taking.

96
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:21,218
Stop now. That's an order.

97
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,694
Abdul, listen to me.
She protects only its eggs.

98
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:42,405
Stand still.

99
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:48,661
You're doing it. Stand just quiet.

100
00:24:57,336 --> 00:25:00,130
Back, back!

101
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,303
We go back to the camp.

102
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:18,148
Zohreh said that this country
is prehistoric.

103
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:24,654
We must be very careful
future.

104
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:29,325
Why did you let us not kill the bird?
-It Was not necessary.

105
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:33,371
Not necessary?
It was by killing Abdul.

106
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:36,207
Abdul still alive.

107
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:46,550
The kind of thinking makes us
to the true monsters, not them.

108
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:50,846
Yes, Captain.

109
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:09,656
Parisa, where are you now?

110
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:17,747
Alas, you dream of your loved Sinbad?

111
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,422
Princess.

112
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:31,719
Sinbad comes after me.
I have foreseen it.

113
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:40,186
His ship now rests on the ocean floor...

114
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:47,401
... and to swim to shore...

115
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:52,823
... is suicide.

116
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:58,537
What do you want?
-It's Not about what I want...

117
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,459
... but what will happen.

118
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,504
I show you...

119
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,466
... what it means.

120
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,102
No.

121
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,991
Captain.

122
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:25,037
-God Be praised, something to drink!
-It Appears to be honey.

123
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,896
I would lift a bowl,
but I have no water left.

124
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:57,569
-This Is an island. We will soon find water.
-Which Island has an infinite desert?

125
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:02,032
Where are the other shore?
Yes, where is it?

126
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:06,119
Was your tongues,
otherwise I crave death.

127
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,539
This is an island.
We will find water.

128
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:14,127
Then I will quench the thirst
with this honey.

129
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,880
Jamal, you do not know
whether it is toxic.

130
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,675
I'm sorry, Captain, but I...

131
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:46,366
No one moves. Stand still.

132
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,294
Running!

133
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:22,142
How many weavers
have been working on it?

134
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:28,398
It took several years to make,
but see it now - completely destroyed.

135
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:31,318
Why do we not stop
to hide?

136
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:37,949
Parisa, I'm not used to
navigate the sea in a woman's heart.

137
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:44,414
Women are not so difficult to understand.
We want simple things.

138
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:48,626
Also a princess puts
devotion higher than jewels.

139
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,966
A wink, a smile,
a poem that praises her now and then.

140
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:02,223
The bright moon reflected
in your radiant face.

141
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:08,062
Your snowy cheekbones
provides water and grace.

142
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:12,775
My heavy heart desires
an audience with you.

143
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:17,988
I appears.
I must return.

144
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:22,075
Your command, I catch it.

145
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,105
-I Called Sinbad...
-I know who you are and what you want.

146
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:57,610
Come in.

147
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:17,379
-Firoozeh?
-Sinbad!

148
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:33,103
-Kaptajn Where did you go?
-I Thought the monsters took you all...

149
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:37,273
... But I see that the villagers
has treated you well.

150
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:41,778
Yes, and they have also given us
much food and drink.

151
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:45,698
-Kaptajn, Let us drink.
-For Life.

152
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:44,338
Sinbad, Your Majesty.

153
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:51,387
My spies told that you have
met my daughter behind my back.

154
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:58,143
Your Majesty,
I admit with a merry

155
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:04,358
-that I love Princess Parisa and makes
anything to marry her.

156
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:08,403
Say what it takes, because I'm...

157
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:13,074
Sinbad! I've heard about you.

158
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:18,455
My daughter has told
that you have always treated her compensation

159
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:22,667
-and that her love
is like yours.

160
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,629
It may never happen.

161
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:32,635
If you are a known man,
then you are an ordinary man.

162
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:35,846
Dad, I do not care.

163
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:42,061
Your people would love you if you gave
your only daughter to one of them.

164
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:47,733
What a terrible idea.

165
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:52,863
You love this man today,
but how do you think you sensor

166
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:58,911
-after a life of poverty,
I give nothing.

167
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:03,623
I would still love him!

168
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:10,964
I offer you five times the value
of your catch and a fine fartoj-

169
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:13,842
-if you sv?rger-

170
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:19,097
-that you sail from here
and never see my daughter again.

171
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,725
With all due respect,
You know what my answer is.

172
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:27,647
Listen to me, Sinbad,
I am a fair man.

173
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:34,153
I offer you the opportunity
to get your desire fulfilled.

174
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:38,240
You can get married
with my daughter today.

175
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:44,038
But a minute after
that I have been man and wife...

176
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,043
-... you will be beheaded.
Daddy!

177
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:53,380
You have never been so barbaric!

178
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:57,300
How do you treat your daughter
and the man she loves, such ?!

179
00:37:57,384 --> 00:38:00,345
Because I am the Sultan!

180
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:05,141
This man desires not only you,
Parisa.

181
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:09,938
He also determines
my whole kingdom fate.

182
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,775
You are no ordinary girl.

183
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,695
Your future would be
entwined forever.

184
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:24,660
If I lose you, I lose
an heir of royal blood.

185
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:28,664
So choose your fate, Sinbad!

186
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:41,301
-Is There something wrong with the food?
No, it's a beautiful sky.

187
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,179
Is there something wrong with me?

188
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:50,519
It is written that a man from the sea
must defeat all evil in this country.

189
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:56,191
Most men think
I'm irresistible.

190
00:38:57,442 --> 00:39:02,739
But you may have other wishes?

191
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:06,409
Sinbad. Sinbad.

192
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:10,721
Firoozeh you live!

193
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:16,686
-It I think...
-We solve it. You come with me.

194
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:20,606
No, I have an idea. See.

195
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:30,115
-I Ask only wait with me.
-No! You follow me!

196
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,620
No, Sinbad.
This is the only way.

197
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:35,011
Poor Firoozeh.

198
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:39,808
So it seems to amuse you-

199
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:43,520
-when I show my sorcery power.

200
00:41:44,396 --> 00:41:48,691
As you know, I
manipulate time.

201
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:59,076
See your child.

202
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:04,874
Your and Sinbads.

203
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:12,047
-How Do I know it's real?
-Because...

204
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:17,636
... The power of human emotions
generate tops...

205
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:23,016
... in time and space.

206
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:34,319
I have not knock
to change them.

207
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:36,279
Or...

208
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:45,205
... to catch these peaks and use
them to travel through time.

209
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:51,836
I am not strong enough,
but soon it will change.

210
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,550
But my Sinbad still alive.

211
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:04,431
I wonder
if you still feel that way...

212
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:11,188
... after we have looked at
your own destiny.

213
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:16,902
It was sin.

214
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:24,659
I see that you do not have any.

215
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:32,450
-Sinbad?
-Firoozeh You live?

216
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:38,915
-A Escaped soul?
-I Know who you are.

217
00:45:38,998 --> 00:45:43,336
Then you know that you can not
play with me. Stand on the line!

218
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:55,180
Are you living still?
Forget it. Just go to the page.

219
00:45:56,849 --> 00:46:04,106
Wait a minute. These are good people.
Why are they not in paradise?

220
00:46:04,189 --> 00:46:07,025
Their fates are not decided yet.

221
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:11,696
But in the case
they have not earned it here.

222
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:18,078
There is cursed
these creatures. Also your men.

223
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:23,666
We are condemned to wander
of sand dunes in perpetuity.

224
00:46:25,293 --> 00:46:28,463
Forward march!

225
00:46:28,546 --> 00:46:30,465
Wait!

226
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:37,763
-Are You interested in a bet?
-I Have never been wanting.

227
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:43,602
Soon you belong to me.
It makes you all the time.

228
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:53,695
But you have things to do, and yet
you are trapped here as their watchdog.

229
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:56,907
True, Sinbad.

230
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:03,580
Killing is a natural part
of the large sand

231
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:07,292
-over life and time.

232
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:10,920
A curse is also part of the world.

233
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:16,926
But taking a life on a
unnatural way and curse it-

234
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,014
-skaber a huge gap.

235
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,518
Suppose I rate it here.

236
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:31,899
If I find this
white deeve and kills him...

237
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:39,114
... so lets these souls
go free without any harm.

238
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:45,287
And if you lose?

239
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:51,126
If I lose, I take your place
and watching over them forever.

240
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:55,839
You will definitely lose.

241
00:47:55,922 --> 00:48:00,802
But in any case
I win.

242
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:03,847
But mark you this, Sinbad-

243
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:08,768
-to be me
is to suffer most of all.

244
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:15,817
I have borne the weight of all losses
and all sorrow, since man came to.

245
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,363
You will do it without end.

246
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:23,824
If you drop.

247
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:28,704
Are you still willing to
to participate in this bet?

248
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:37,171
Yes.

249
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:39,715
Yes.

250
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:17,501
-What Are you?
-This Picture paints a thousand words.

251
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:22,256
-The You do not need.
You look like the Sultan.

252
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:27,636
You see, what you will see.
Only what your brain will see.

253
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,849
A spirit becomes a part of you,
when it is freed.

254
00:49:31,932 --> 00:49:35,936
-A True spirit.
Yes, to the service.

255
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:41,566
Is it true that the spirits grant
three wishes when they are freed.

256
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:48,865
It is said,
but for five hundred years ago-

257
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:56,206
-lokkede A treacherous and evil
human me to go into lampen-

258
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:00,126
-after he had gotten his wish.

259
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,256
As that was not bad enough,
he spent his final desired

260
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:09,552
-to use my powers
to a felling

261
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:13,723
-for the unfortunate soul,
which freed me.

262
00:50:13,806 --> 00:50:19,353
He said that my deliverer
also could get three onsker-

263
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:24,233
-but then he added
a terrible condition.

264
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:30,864
The man must die within the first
sunset after my release.

265
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:35,994
So what have you got to say now, Sinbad?

266
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,421
So I will not
ask anyone wants.

267
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:51,759
I can not let you go
without your three wishes, you know.

268
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:55,597
One of them can not be
to spare your life.

269
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:02,603
I'm not looking forward to this.
When the day dawns, ending your life.

270
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:06,816
Just to be sure...

271
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:11,529
Not a single request can
spare me this despair?

272
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:16,283
Correct. A desire can not save you.
It makes me very sore.

273
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:23,540
But the spirit must obey his liberator.
So w ant now, Sinbad.

274
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:31,506
My first wish is that you
spares me for this despair.

275
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,179
I thought I
had explained it to you.

276
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:43,101
One of your wishes
can not spare you. What a waste!

277
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:47,438
Now there are only two wishes left.

278
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:56,239
My second wish is
to be close to Parisa.

279
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:09,460
See the power that you testify.

280
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:19,928
See the power that you testify.

281
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:26,351
-And Parisa?
Yes, behind these doors.

282
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:32,190
I can only take you
to deeves cave.

283
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:38,988
But what role does it play?
You must nonetheless soon say goodbye.

284
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:44,535
Yes, of course.
My third and last wish is...

285
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,833
... that you spare me
of this despair.

286
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,962
You must now observe the consequences of...

287
00:52:57,214 --> 00:53:02,261
Excuse me a moment.
It's a bit confusing.

288
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:07,224
It takes just a moment, Sinbad.
Thank you.

289
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:11,395
Three wishes for five hundred years.
Minus one, minus one...

290
00:53:11,478 --> 00:53:17,109
It might not be the entire desired.
One moment, Sinbad.

291
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:25,200
You need not be so confused.
A claim could not spare me.

292
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:29,704
-Continue...
-You Did not say that more people want...

293
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:33,166
... could not save me
from certain destruction.

294
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,881
Do struggling contend
if you do not have the right!

295
00:53:41,424 --> 00:53:44,927
Your will is my law.

296
00:53:48,848 --> 00:53:54,311
Thank you, Sinbad. You have freed me
from another prison.

297
00:53:55,479 --> 00:54:01,443
My time here is almost over,
but before I say goodbye...

298
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:06,156
barging, undesired you do it here?
-No.

299
00:54:07,616 --> 00:54:13,330
But there is no book,
which says that gifts are bad.

300
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:22,923
What should I...

301
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:13,263
The white deeve was a powerful force. 

302
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:17,350
armies could not escape
its grip. 

303
00:56:36,469 --> 00:56:39,346
I want kill you again.

304
00:58:29,787 --> 00:58:34,500
Yes, yes, yes... Sinbad...

305
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:40,923
You seem to
to have more lives than a cat.

306
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:44,009
Where is Parisa?

307
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:09,492
Before chipper
you should look around.

308
00:59:12,245 --> 00:59:16,874
I can free the beast
with a single motion.

309
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:26,800
-Sinbad, Is it really you?
-Everything Is good.

310
00:59:29,053 --> 00:59:34,308
-Befri Her!
You're not in a position to make demands.

311
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:39,062
What do you want?
-It's Not what I want...

312
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:42,774
... but what will happen.

313
00:59:42,858 --> 00:59:48,863
A long time ago, I asked a spirit
grant my desired

314
00:59:48,947 --> 00:59:55,411
-about unlimited power,
but the spirit tricked me.

315
00:59:55,495 --> 01:00:01,334
My power is limited to this island.

316
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:06,589
However, this is changing.

317
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:13,304
A new day dawns and leads a storm with
itself, which spans the entire world.

318
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:20,436
A powerful soul as your
generates feelings for your elskede-

319
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:26,024
-and becomes the catalyst
which makes my magic thousandfold stronger!

320
01:00:26,108 --> 01:00:30,320
Do you understand it, Sinbad?

321
01:00:30,404 --> 01:00:35,367
You're the last
ingredient in this drink.

322
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,454
Was Parisa the bait
that led me here?

323
01:00:39,538 --> 01:00:44,334
You threatened the woman I love.
My crew is gone.

324
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:48,922
Firoozeh which was as a sister death.

325
01:00:49,005 --> 01:00:55,595
I know you see me
as embodied evil.

326
01:00:55,678 --> 01:01:02,226
Or am I part of the balance sheet
as nature intended.

327
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:06,731
-It's Not too late to stop this.
-Make!

328
01:01:06,814 --> 01:01:10,901
You only have one chance now.

329
01:01:10,985 --> 01:01:15,906
Give me your soul,
otherwise I get rid of this beast freedoms

330
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:20,953
-which completes your life here and now.

331
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,137
-It Accepts me.
-No!

332
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:49,188
-What Will happen to him?
-He Can go with me...

333
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:53,860
... or be my humble servant.

334
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:58,447
It's his choice.

335
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:08,874
I have two conditions.
Parisa go free now.

336
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:14,421
And the city Malek must have peace.

337
01:02:14,505 --> 01:02:21,386
Only then I promise you my soul,
and maybe I go with you.

338
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:26,308
You have my word.

339
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:30,478
Let's get it over with.

340
01:02:32,272 --> 01:02:36,651
Take this and wear it around your neck.

341
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:42,991
And put your sword.

342
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,611
Why are you hesitating? Choose now.

343
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:26,241
Wealth, a ship and your life.

344
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:32,455
Or... one kn?lers wedding.

345
01:03:41,714 --> 01:03:45,801
-The Choice is easy, your Majesty.
-Kraften!

346
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:52,850
I might as well be dead
like living an empty life without her.

347
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:13,078
I do not get wiped out!

348
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:55,494
There was another woman
in your life that you loved.

349
01:04:55,577 --> 01:04:58,580
Your mother!

350
01:06:50,856 --> 01:06:53,817
Hurry to the balloon!

351
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,612
Again evil
unable to defeat it - 

352
01:08:23,696 --> 01:08:29,285
-a always been
the true ultimate power. 

353
01:08:29,368 --> 01:08:32,997
Power in a motivated heart.
