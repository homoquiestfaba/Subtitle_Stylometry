Yeah, nothing
was downloadable
back then.

It's a peace
summit, guys.

is it that
you've lost your way

50
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,986

51
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,072
This is a peace summit.

52
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,660

to me now.

53

Hey.

54
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,171

I know the truth.

64
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,886
You are a liar

65
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,389

66
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,904
No fighting.
We're here for
a peace summit.

67
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,823
You must put your
petty differences aside.

68
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,993
Master Fumitaka
has ordered it.

69
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,245
Now.

Surviving.

74
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,100
Surviving?
Come on.

75
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,269
It's time to flourish.

76
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,439
Master Fumitaka will be
very pleased to see you.

77
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,359
It's been way
too long, brother.

78
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,280
No weapons
in the bunker.

79
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,866
Relinquish them.
Now.

80
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,709
Who's Captain Uptight
over there?
Hiroshi.

81
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,670
We trained together
under Master Fumitaka.

82
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,798
He was chosen
as a Master's second.

83
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,010
Over you?

84
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,013
I guess
you can't be given everything,
can you, little brother?

00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,548
How far down
does this thing go?

87
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,551
These old bunkers
sometimes went
100 floors down.

88
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,055
Thousands of feet
into the earth.

89
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,225
People lived down here
after the Great War.

90
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,936

Only the 20th floor?

93
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,408
I usually like
my peace summits
at least 50 floors down.

94
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,411
No one has ever come back
from the lower floors alive.

95

Ooh.

96
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,751

Brothers and sisters,

our very way of life.

No clan may harm

No ninja may harm

Violation of this truce

125
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,712

00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,757
I spent all mine
getting us off
the summit floor.

183
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,426
Mar?
Full.

184
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,095
Surge?
Thirsty.

185
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,013
Surge.
Full.

186
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,601
<i>Barely time
to make a blue spark.</i>

187
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,774
Did anyone get a look
at the assassin?

188
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,194
No. It all happened
so fast.

189
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,030
It's got to be Becker.

190
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,950
Becker?

191
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,119
How could it be Becker?
You look nothing alike.

192
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,621
The look
on Becker's face
right after.

193
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,957
Like he knew
it was going
to happen.

194
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>Well, who would want
Fumitaka dead anyways?</i>

195
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,128
It's Becker.

196
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,380
He doesn't want peace.

197
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,133
He wants us gone.

198
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,802
He kills Fumitaka
and then blames me.

199
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,888
<i>Gives him the excuse
to finally take our
entire village out</i>

200
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,890
<i>while putting him in tight
with the new regime.</i>

201
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,892
Two birds, one stone.

202
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,371
If you turn yourself in,
they'll let the rest
of us go.

203
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,874
I doubt <i>that.
It's worth a shot,
isn't i2'?</i>

204
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,418
We're just waiting
to die down here.

205
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,545
Your loyalty
is appreciated.

206
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,673
You got us
into this mess coming
to this ridiculous summit.

207
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,341
Surge, you're acting
like an idiot.

208
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,177
Oh, I'm an idiot, huh?
I'm an idiot?

209
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,596
Look where it's
gotten us to, huh?
Surge.

210
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,520
How is he going
to hold this clan
together?

211
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,693
Well, at least
I'll be drunk
when we die.

212
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,951
We'll stay alive
by the Code.
Your Code is dead
and so are we.

213
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,620
Our Code
is a commitment.

214
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,456
To the clan.
The village.
Each other.

215
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,710
This isn't about us.
About whether we live.

216
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,545
It's about whether
our wives live,

217
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,382
our children live,
our clan lives.

218
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,468
The Code
is bigger than me.

219
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,345
Bigger than us.

220
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,557
Brother,

221
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,728

222

Come on.

223
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,247
Let's get out of here.

224
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,238
Let's split up.

225
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,324
I don't think
that's a good idea.

226
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,034
We'll never find
each other.

227
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,369
We've got to cover
more ground.

228
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,041
All right,
let's split up.

229
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,335
But remember this spot.

Oh, Sky
wasn't born to us.

268
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,782
He was
from Becker's clan.

269

When they discovered
he couldn't hear or speak,

270
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:57,038
they cast him out.

271
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,458
Sky wandered

was still master
of our clan.

541
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,319
The assassination,
I know you didn't do it.

542
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:24,697
What a revelation.

543
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,700
Are you finally
admitting your guilt?

544
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,734
Three witnesses
saw you.

545
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,320
They saw
an illusion.

546
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,090
Do it, you coward.

547
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,095
Kill me.

548
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,888
Who is headed
to my village?

549
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,723
What village?

550
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,559
Who killed Fumitaka?

551
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,977
You did.

552
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,314
Didn't you?

553
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,092
Brother.

554
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,595
Hey.

555
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,764
Where are we?

556
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,099
Home, Surge.
Home.

557
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,436
The poison
is moving again.

558
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,688
We need to get you back
to the village now.

559
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,774
Water.

560
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,777
Okay, I'll be back
in a second.

561
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,412
<i>[water running]</i>

562
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,024
Brother?

563
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:49,151
Ahh.
No!

564
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,079
Reveal yourself.

565
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,834
Every clan has
their secret weapon.

566
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,380
But I have the most
powerful one of them all.

567
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,427
Deceit.

568
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,855
<i>[muted chanting]</i>

569
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,550
<i>You killed
our master.</i>

570
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,762
Why?
When did you become
so naive?

571
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,144
You have no honor.
No respect for the Code.

572
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,688
I live
by my own code.

573
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,992
You had everything.
No, I had nothing.

574
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:25,915
Master Fumitaka
always loved you most.

575
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:29,919
I knew you would
always be my enemy.

576
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,837
Fumitaka chose you.

577
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,882
Only because
I made it so.

578
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,787
<i>When we were young,</i>

579
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,456
my deceit was subtle.

580
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,669
Master Fumitaka
seeing you steal
an apple

581
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:15,965
or hearing you tell
a little white lie.

582
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:20,136
Before long,
he couldn't quite
trust you.

583
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,304
That made him very sad.

584
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:26,642
<i>It broke his poor
little heart.</i>

585
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:30,646
Needless to say,
I started looking
very promising to him.

586
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,149
He gave you everything.
No.

587
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,652
I waited years
to take over the clan.

588
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,738
But our beloved Fumitaka

589
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,991
decided to call
for peace,

590
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:46,162
<i>bring you and all
the others back
into the fold.</i>

591
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:50,499
<i>[thundering]</i>

592
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,268
<i>[shouting]</i>

593
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,766
Ahh!

594
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,272
I intercepted
his message.

595
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,816
He was going
to make you
his second.

596
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:03,447
<i>Seeing you as master
of the Lost Clan,</i>

597
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:07,243
<i>upholding the Code
so well.</i>

598
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:10,412
Practically
made me vomit.

599
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,457
That is why now
you must die.

600
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,584
<i>[grunting]</i>

601
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:17,253
[yelling]

602
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,394
Brother.
[groans]

603
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,823
Cage of the Lost Clan,

604
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,285
you are a great warrior

605
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,122
and an honorable ninja.

606
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:01,005
Asleader
of the Southern Clan,

607
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,634
I promise you
your homeland
will be protected.

608
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,392
Don't protect us.

609
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,894
Respect us.

610
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:21,442
Come on, brother.
Let's go home.
