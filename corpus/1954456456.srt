it's a legitimate arre.

He's been living here

He's alleged to owe

in excess of
half a million dollars.

   told us was true, Brit.

 It's the tip of the iceberg.

1236
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:34,977
I mean, he was charged with
credit card fraud in Virginia,

1237
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:37,513
though those charges
were later dropped.

1238
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,414
                    Which means
          they may not be true.

1239
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:42,417
Which means
the charges were dropped.

1240
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:44,253
      He knows a lot of people,
                          okay.

1241
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:46,455

           rebooting my career.

1242
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:48,323
       I read a script
        that he wrote.

1243
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:51,927
Look, it is true that he has
an executive producer title

1244
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,029
and story-by writing credit
on a film,

1245
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,665
but he had to sue
to get them.

1246
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:59,101
So I can't say
how legitimate those are.

1247
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:02,938

he's done this to.
