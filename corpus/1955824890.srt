Oh, yeah,
Bo's great. Love it.

358
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,702
Mary, no.

359
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,414
No, if you name him,
you're gonna start feeling
affectionate toward him.

360
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:49,483
And once you feel
affectionate, you're
gonna want to keep him.

361
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:52,810
And if there is one thing
we are definitely not
going to do...

362
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,999
Do you think he'll be
warm enough down here?

363
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,818
That's my workshop.

364
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,722
Let's just let him stay here
till he's all better.

365
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,296
Don't you think
we should at least...

366

Uh...

371
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,372
Come on.
Let's go talk upstairs.

372
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,747
Okay...

373
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,184

I am so glad you're okay.

Do you know how much
flying around I have
done looking for you?

380
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,978
I thought that maybe
the miller caught you
and was gonna eat you.

381
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,805
Eat me? Yeah, I don't think
he was gonna do that.

382

He had crazy in his eyes.

383

He's still out
there someplace.

384

385
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,579
Nah. I think we're good.

386
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,148

You're saying that baby
is the actual Messiah?

390
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,560

I do need to sit down,

I know. I know how
it sounds, but yes.

393
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,801
And God wants you
and me to raise him.

394
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:27,271
Me? Are you sure, uh...

395
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:28,941
I mean, did
the angel mention me?

396
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,042
Well, no, but it's...

397
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,944
Look, I can't raise
the Son of God.

398
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,245
He's a king.
I'm just a carpenter.

399

Hate to say it,
but even if we got you out,

410
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,382
you're never gonna
make it to the royal

Dave, look,
I don't want to hold you back.

You fly ahead without me.

413
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,155
I'll catch up once my leg heals.

414
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,233
No. We're in this together,
and I'm not gonna
leave you here.

00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,802
- Friends don't do that.
- Are you sure?

416
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,461
Yeah, and besides, you'd
never make it without me.

- Okay.

422
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,439
So, now what?

423
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:36,507
Hide out here
until your leg heals,

424
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,309
and then just get
yourself kicked out.

425
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,311
And we'll be back on track, pal.

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,149

431
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,322
I said hide here,
not settle in and get a name.

Now bring in my scribes.

537
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,609
There is a prophecy.

538
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,610
- What are they saying?
- Shh.

539
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,179
I can't make it out,
but it's something about
the king of the... Shoes?

540
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,416
King of the shoes?
That's what this is about?

541
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,452
- Mmm-mmm. That can't be right.
- Whoa! Look!

542
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:50,255
Look! Dude has gold slippers.
King of the shoes, no doubt.

543
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,689
That, Felix, is money
and no taste.

544
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,092
Can we move past the shoes?

545
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:55,694
- I think...
- Yo, look at that guy.

00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,638
- You see him?

I know these things.

He's like a nightmare
wearing a helmet.

00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:07,638
We must find this king at once.

to the task.

In the meantime, I invite
you to stay in the palace
as my royal guests.

No, no, that's
not necessary, sire.

Oh. But, I insist.

00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,587
Okay. That was sinister.

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,322
Yep. We're leaving.

704
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,583
But he definitely cried
like a baby.

705
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,719
- But I digress.
- We don't have time for this.

706
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:04,388
No! Wait! The show
is about to start.

707
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:06,290
Okay. You can...

708
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,026

710
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,993
What are you doing?
Don't watch me.
(CONTINUES HUMMING)

711
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,679
(CHUCKLES) Aw, yeah.
This bird can dance.

(GROWLING)

714
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,463
No, guys. Guys, guys, guys,
no, this is the best part.

715
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,788
Okay, there you go.
They're gone.

716
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,039
Where's your owner?

717
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,157
Yeah! Where's your owner?

718
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,525
Who, the miller?
I don't know a miller.

719
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,963
My owner's a nice
pregnant lady.
You would love her.

720
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,114
That's her.

721
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,131
Where is she?

722
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:52,503
Wait, you're looking for Mary?
Did I say &quot;pregnant lady&quot;?

723
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:54,037
I meant &quot;miller.&quot;

724
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:56,340
I'm just a mill donkey
on vacation.

725
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,392
Who's Mary?

726
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,311
Keep talking.

727
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:02,324
Okay, that was pathetic.
Let me handle this, Bo.

728
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,447
- Guys, donkeys are stubborn.
- Yeah.

729
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,526
- He's not gonna tell you anything.
- Sorry, guys.

730
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,061
You would have to
torture it out of him.

731
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:09,454
Wait, what?

732
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,424
(GRUNTS)

733
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,876
He didn't bandage himself.

734
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:16,193
That's her scent.

735
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:18,362
Now we just gotta figure out
which way she went.

736
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,497
- We'll tell her you said hello.

00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,475
Whoo! They left the gate open.

740
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,516
Okay. The royal caravan
is right this way.

741
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,852
We'll catch it in no time.

742
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,353
Wait. Where you going?
Dream is that way.

743
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:44,689
Right, but Mary is this way.

744
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,890
No, no, no, no.

745
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,190
Royal caravan cannot wait
for a rescue mission.

746
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:52,029
Especially when that guy
is after her.
He is major bad news.

747
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,098
I'm not gonna just
let her get hurt, Dave.

748
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,333
She was nice to me.

749
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,434
Aw, come on, Bo.

750
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,035
We've been waiting for this.

751
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,503
It'll just take a second.

752
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,572
Once Mary's safe,
we'll turn right around

753
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,225
- and join the royal caravan.

754
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,176
Deal?

755
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,045
(GROANS) Fine! Deal.

756
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,880
So we turn right around.

757
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,884
Okay, leave this to me.
I know a shortcut.

He'll lead us right to her.

761
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,681
And then what?

762
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:28,831
Then we find the baby.

763
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,801
Oh. That baby messed
with the wrong dogs.

764
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:34,605
Nothing scares us.
Not even a baby.
Right, partner?

765
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:36,373
Just stop.

I'm bad at being bad?

I got it.

770
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:59,129
Okay, Dave, be honest.
Are we lost?

771
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,731
No.

772
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,642
'Cause this doesn't exactly
look like the beaten path.

773
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,868

Hey, look. It's Mary.
That's them.

my terrible shortcut.

You're welcome.

786
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,277
Which way am I supposed to go?

787

Well, actually,
I'm here with my friend, Dave.

807
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:38,638
I'm meeting him at the bottom.
We're on the road to Bethlehem

808
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:40,930
so we can catch up with
my friend Mary and save her.

809
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:45,269
And once we do,
we will be joining
the royal caravan.

00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:47,571
Huh?

00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:50,173
Well, I guess I'll get back
to following the star.

813
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,241
The star? You mean the...

814
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,611
- You mean that super bright one?
- Yeah, that one.

815
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,556
Have you noticed how
it's been getting brighter?

816
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,848
Totally. And the weird way
it kind of pulsates.

817
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:00,184
Yes! It's like it's...

818
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:01,335
Like it means something.

819
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:02,352
Exactly.

00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,856
Okay, come on.
We're almost down.
One more chasm.

This is really easy
for you, isn't it?

822
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,596
You got it, Bo.
Just don't look down.

Now, just... Ooh!

Just try to get
your hooves in...

for a wedge thing here.

That's it. You got it.
You're a wedge.

Fantastic.

just lift that hoof
and take a step down.

Just one hoof at a time.

Well, didn't exactly
stick the landing,
but that was good.

See you around.

are beautiful

Deadly steep, but great views.

You've been to Bethlehem?

858
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,685
Are you kidding?

859
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:44,020
I grew up around there.
I know all the ins and outs,

860
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:46,356
how to avoid predators
and treacherous high cliffs.

861
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,825
(SCOFFS)
The treacherous cliffs.

862
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,680
You're not really considering
this, are you?

863
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,998
Come on, Ruth. Lead the way.

864
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,901
Sheep are usually
better at following,
but I will do my best.

865
00:38:58,034 --> 00:38:59,369
Let's go, flock.

866
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,571
Yippee.

00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,054
Felix, come on.

868
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,689
Shouldn't we be sneaking out?

869
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,292
Why are we sneaking in?

870
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,132
King Herod is up to something.

871
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,200
And we are gonna find out what.

872
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,736
With the help of a little
well-placed distraction.

fellas. Hurry.

Still no report from my hunter?

00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,948
Has he found the child?

878
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,549
(STAMMERS) No, sire.

879
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,884
But your scribes are ready
to present their findings.

880
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,520
Well, finally,
someone's doing their job.

881
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,389
Ah, so tell me where he is.

882
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,391
According to the prophecy,
Your Majesty,

883
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,627
the new king is to be
born in Bethlehem.

884
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,896
And? That's all?
To what family?

885
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,533
Who are they? I am the king.

886
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:09,540
Huh. I am the king of Judea.

887
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,841
If you people can't
find this one child,

888
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,077
then I'll just have
to kill them all.

889
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,579
See? I told you.

890
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,082
Shall we send soldiers
to track him down?

891
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,919
Um, no.

892
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,554
You three, come.

893
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:25,687
It's the wise men.

894
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,756
Hide, quickly.

895
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,627
So, any word of the new king?

896
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,128
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

897
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:34,064
Look for him in Bethlehem.
You're free to go.

898
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,466
Our humblest thanks,
Your Majesty.

899
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,103
When you find him,
send word to me.

900
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,007
I dearly wish
to know where he is

901
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,776
so that I, too, may honor him...

902
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,578
(SNIFFING)

903
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:49,513
With a gift.

904
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,321
You know, I think
he might be up to something.

905
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,324
He's using the wise men
to track down the new king.

906
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,627
Yeah! Plus, did you see him
crumple that flower?

907
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,129
BOTH: Shush!

908
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,514
We have to warn the new king.

909
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:07,765
Pack your bags, boys.

910
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,767
Looks like we're
going to Bethlehem.

911
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,604
And now our tour will
continue past these
pebbles on the path.

912
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,440
Watch your step.
Watch your step.
And watch your step.

913
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:18,308
I blame you for this.

914
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,644
(GASPS) There they are.

915
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,447
Come on.

916
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:28,619

917

(EXCLAIMS)

918
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,993
(GASPS) Mary.

919
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,570
Are you sure you don't want
to sit in the cart?

920
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:39,796
No, it's hard enough
for you as it is.

921
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,466
Just let me fix my boot.

922
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,867
I don't believe it.

923
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,134
Really, I'm fine.

924
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,136
No, not that. That.

925
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,139
Bo?

926
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,909
Mary. You're in danger.

927
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,880
You need to listen to
what I'm about to say
extremely carefully.

928
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:59,316
(BRAYING)

929
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,350
You ever feel like he's
trying to talk to us?

930
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,821
Why is he here?
Where did he come from?

931
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,155
She's not getting it.

932
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,357
Okay, uh, new plan.

933
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,892
Can you two act like dogs?

934
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,778
What do you think?

935
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,529
Uh, yes. I do a great dog.

936
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,231
Dogs are my fourth best animal.

937
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,732
Great. Just follow my lead.

938
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,906
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
&quot;Look at me. I'm Mary.
I'm so pregnant.&quot;

939
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,509
(IN DEEP VOICE)
&quot;I'm Joseph.
I'm in a bad mood.&quot;

940
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:29,380
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that supposed to be me?

941
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:31,615
It's totally you.

942
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,926
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
&quot;Oh, no! Look!
Here come the dogs!&quot;

943
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,110
(WHISPERING) That's you guys.

944
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,220
Oh. Oh! Uh...

945
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,687
(PANTING)

946
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,589
Woof! Woof, woof, woof.

947
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:42,058
Throw me a stick,
and I'll bring it right back.

948
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,660
Oh, what's this?
It's a tail?

949
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,038
- I'm gonna get you.
- Seriously?

950
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,473
We're doing this
instead of the royal caravan?

951
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,899
No, Ruth, you're a scary dog.
Just be meaner.

952
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:53,803
Oh. Oh? Meaner?
You mean like...
(GROWLS) this!

953

954
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,583
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, no! They got me!

955
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:00,611
If only a certain donkey
had warned me.

958
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:07,484
There is something seriously
wrong with those animals.

959
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:09,652
I think Bo's trying
to tell us something.

960
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,322
Come on, come on.

961
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:19,428
I think he wants a belly rub.

962
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:23,399
What? No. I mean, yes,
always, but not now.

963
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,902
Ugh. This is not working.

964
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,203
Guys, I hate to break this up,
but we've got trouble.

965
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:31,173
Mama!

966
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,876
Those guys?

967
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:34,420
Yeah, they've been
following us since
we came down the cliff.

968
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,084
Couldn't you have pointed
that out sooner?

969
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:37,981
Oh, no. They followed
us right to her.

970
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,750
Well, why don't we hide
in that big flock over there?

971
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,619
That's what a sheep would do.

972
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:44,221
Yes. Great idea.

973
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,423
MARY: Bo, what are you...

974
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:48,225
- Joseph?
- Right behind you.

975
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,462
Oh, okay.

976
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,962
Wow, you must be really thirsty.

977
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:54,816
I'm gonna grab some water.
Do you want some?

978
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:58,202
Sure. Yeah, I guess
I'll just take a look
at that wheel, then.

979
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,456
Don't carry too much, okay?

980
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:03,941
I won't.

981
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,010
Oh! Sorry.

982
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,218
Fresh figs! Get your fresh
figs here. I got them.

983
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:19,189
Hello, sir. You look like
a man who appreciates
fine pottery.

three buckets of water.

Do you see anything?

00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,066
What are we looking for?

riding with royalty.

993
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,678

and lead them away.

Ruth, you stay here
and guard Mary.

995
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,215
If they find her,
get our attention.

996
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,217
Yeah. We should
have a secret signal.
