give you some fun money.

We went to the same church,
lived on the same block.

- Well,

66
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,253
you've been taking care
of others for too long.

No. I'm Louise.
I'm Cathy's cousin.

You must be frank.

74
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,405
Cathy and I have
talked a lot about you

75
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,807
the last couple of months
and about Laura.

76
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,810
I was just talking to Laura
about her future.

77
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,780
Shut up, bitch.

78
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,716
- It's just a tick.
- Sorry.

79
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,688
Laura's gonna be
all taken care of.

80
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,391
I see.
And what about you, frank?

81
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,992
Do you have somebody new
to take care of you?

82
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,762
- Ah, no.
- Yes.

83
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,464
I... I don't need
a... a new caretaker.

84
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,468
I'm finding him
a new caretaker very soon.

85
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,070
I just hope
you're not expecting Laura

86
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,438

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,806
Oh, no one needs to worry about

88
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,008

92
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,355

- Quite a bit of it.

Yeah, it's chocolate all right.

- Hmm.
- Will you quit eating them?

112
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,667
I made them for Laura.

113
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,670
I shouldn't feel better,
though, should I?

114

Besides, Meth's the drug

Why were you trying to give me
your bat, frank?

162
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,143
Ray, I told you
I want you to have it.

00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,351
Who gives a fuck?

354
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,852
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

355
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,021
- Hand it over.
- What?

356
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,490
- I'm not that bad.
- ( Laughs ) Right.

357
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,659
May we remind you
of the watermelon cooler night?

358
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,994
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

359
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,863
- Let's go.
- That never happened.

360
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,565
Thank you.

361
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,067
A toast...

362
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,769
To no more fifth period,
no more curfews,

363
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,471
no more uniforms,

364
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,473
and tomorrow we hit the road.

365
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,974
Cheers.

366
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,944
It's only one shot,
so I don't want to see a drop.

367
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,381
- Mm.
- Race you.

368
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,717
- Mm!
- I gotta pee.

369
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,885
- Oh, jeez.
- ( Coughing )

370
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,555
- Wow, okay.
- Oh, yeah.

371
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,558
So, I'm surprised
frank convinced you to come.

372
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,394
- How did he do it?
- Um...

373
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,796
By being super annoying.

374
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,864
He's been acting really strange

375
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,400
since mom died.

376
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,635
How're you doing?

377
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,572
She was sick for nine months,

378
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,874
at least she's not
suffering anymore.

379
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,578
I'm fine.

380
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,913
Seriously,
I'm... I'm totally fine.

381
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,448
Those last couple weeks
I just...

382
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,717
I could not see her

383
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,986
like that anymore.

384
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,988
But I just...
You know, I worry about frank.

385
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,857
I mean, I'm all he's got.

386
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,525
Well, he's a grown man, Laura.

387
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,727
He'll deal.

388
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,729
Yeah.

389
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,731
I just don't know
what he's thinking anymore.

390
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,066
You know?

391
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,936
Well, his caretaker is gone.

392
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,105
- You're leaving for college...
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,107
And he has to adjust
to living with some

394
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,809
- <i>stranger in his home.</i>
- Oh!

395
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:34,478
I mean, he's probably
just at the end of his rope.

396
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,547
Ah, bitch!
( Barks )

397
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,149
Wait.
What did you say?

398
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:42,686
You know, he's probably
just at the end of his rope.

399
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:46,023
- Oh, shit.
- Where are you going?

400
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,191
Laura?

401
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:50,594
<i>( Music playing )</i>

402
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,530
- ( Yells out )
- <i>( Woman screaming )</i>

403
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,698
What?

404
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,505
- Ah.
- Come on.

405
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,918
- You sleepwalk now, too?
- ( Gasps )

406
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,494
What?

407
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,842
Late night?

408
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,243
Guess I'll get breakfast.

409
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,745
Why were you giving away
your bat, frank?

410
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,181
I... I told you already.

411
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,050
My mom took care of you
my whole life,

412
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,718
and now suddenly you don't need

413
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,886
a new caretaker?

414
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:49,887
- Why?
- <i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

415
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,523
I told you.
Ray...

416
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,861
Where's frank?

417
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,029
He sent me this cryptic email
last night.

418
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,032
- Where is he?
- I wouldn't call it cryptic.

419
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,934
What does it say?

420
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,803
"Urgent.

421
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,606
Please clean everything up
before Laura comes home."

422
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,674
Oh, oh, I... I meant
to send that

423
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,643
to my housekeeper.

424
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,145
Housekeeper?
I'm your housekeeper.

425
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,680
So, I hired a new housekeeper.

426
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,082
<i>No, you didn't!</i>

427
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,217
Where's the rope, frank?

428
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,686
What rope?

429
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,689
I did hire a housekeeper.
You're leaving.

430
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,224
- What would you know?
- <i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

431
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't you bother
answering the door, frank.

432
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:32,196
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Shut up, bitch!

433
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:36,600
Oh, hi frank, is Laura ready?

434
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:37,935
- No.
- <i>Yes.</i>

435
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,104
I'm not going.
I gotta stay with frank.

436
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,772
What do you gotta stay here for?

437
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,275
I got ray and... and the gay
to take care of me.

438
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,910
You know why.

439
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:49,079
God, why did you
take the rope, frank?

440
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,749
Stupid, lying whore, fucking...

441
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,218
Mm-mmm.

442
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,720
The zipper on your suitcase
is broken.

443
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,124
You told me, right?
Look at it.

444
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:03,093
So, I put slipknots
in the rope so I could...

445
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,262
Eventually I'll tie that thing
together so it'll stick together

446
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,797
<i>and you could take it.</i>

447
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,666
Satisfied? Bitch!

448
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,001
I'm sorry, frank.

449
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,905
I'm sorry,
but I can't stay around

450
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,908
- all of this negative energy.
- What? What?

451
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,810
No, no, no, no.
Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.

452
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,078
No, you can't go.

453
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,680
I'm supposed to leave
this morning.

454
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:23,981
- So, you are coming?
- No, forget it. Nope.

455
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,683
Rick, Rick,
no, we'll pay you double.

456
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,351
- My trip's only a few days.
- Nope, no thank you.

457
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,853
We'll pay you a months' salary
just to stay till I get back.

458
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,855
- Give me my stuff.
- Come on!

459
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:36,093
- ( Grunts )
- Rick!

460
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,695
Donald trump
couldn't pay me enough

461
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,863
to take care of that lunatic!

462
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,635
That's it.
I can't go.

463
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,203
I can't...

464
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,075
You have to.

465
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,076
I can't be trapped alone

466
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,277
in a car for two days

467
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,912
with Hannah Montana over there.

468
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,146
She'll have me Kumbayaing

469
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,116
before we're even out
of the driveway.

470
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,818
( Sighs )

471
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,686
I can help, of course,

472
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,723
but I can't manage a 24/7 watch.

473
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,057
I'm sorry, you guys, I can't go.

474
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,826
I cannot leave frank alone.

475
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,694
You can go.
I'll be fine.

476
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,763
I... I... I'll call you
every day until...

477
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,865
Until the day
that you don't call me?

478
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,634
It's only for a couple of days.

479
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,636
It'll be fine, right?

480
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:22,139
Oh, please don't flake.
You have promises to keep.

481
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,274
Alisa, if Rick hadn't quit,
maybe I'd consider it,

482
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,010
but something
is going on with frank.

483
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,177
I can feel it.

484
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,979
I can't leave him
alone right now.

485
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,118
Why don't we bring frank along?

486
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,720
You mean frank?

487
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,055
Oh, my god.

488
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,257
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my god, Laura.

489
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,993
I don't know why I said that.
I'm just really hungover.

490
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,695
- And I...
- Alisa:<i> Fuck no!</i>

491
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:47,331
I'm not gonna be trapped
in a car with a grown-ass man.

492
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,199
We're supposed to have fun
on this trip.

493
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,868
Look, I lied to my parents

494
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,069
about going on a church retreat

495
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,170
this weekend.

496
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,773
- So, we can't bail now.
- No!

497
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,942
No, this is a totally
fucked up idea, Laura.

498
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,111
You can't seriously
be thinking about this.

499
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,813
I don't know if I have much
of a choice.

500
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,682
Come on, it'll be fun.

501
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,151

wanna go on a road trip?

I'll take over
when my head clears up a bit.

No prob.

508
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,838
Do you wanna
sit up front, frank?

509

There's more room up there.

510

00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,473
The movie game is a good one.

529
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,074
Yellow car?

530
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,877
<i>( Bell dings )</i>

531
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,416
Do you want anything?

532
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,254
- Laura?
- Yeah.

533
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,357
Why was Stacy
buried so far from home?

534
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,226
Well, her mom's family
is from up there.

535
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,829
So that is home.

536
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,298
And it was your idea
to take this trip?

537
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:41,071
Well, we all made a promise
to Stacy when she was dying.

538
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,574
She kept saying

539
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:47,945
how she'll never see
her 18th birthday.

540
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,848
And we were
just sitting with her

541
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,351
and all we could
think to say was...

542
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,086
We'll spend
your 18th birthday with you.

543
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,893
I don't think any of us
actually believed it.

544
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,562
What?

545
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,065
No, nothing.
It's just...

546
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,335
I shoulda known this.

547
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,405
You and I lived
in the same house.

548
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,042
Fucking idiot.

549
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,222
Want anything?

550
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,126
What the fuck, Kim?

551
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,594
We're not even a hundred miles
out of town yet.

552
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,429
Why the hell didn't you tell us

553
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,164
this piece of shit only got
two miles to the gallon?

554
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,667
Sorry. I usually just
drive it around town.

555
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,569
So, I didn't know.

556
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,173
Holy shit.

557
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,909
Is that Kevin bowman?

558
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,279
What?

559
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,347
The gas guy.
Oh, my gosh.

560
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,682
Remember him?

561
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,084
He was like, a living legend
in ninth grade.

562
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,286
Senior quarterback.

563
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,587
The most popular guy
in high school.

564
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,422
<i>- Kevin bowman.
- No, it can't be.</i>

565
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,590
I heard he moved to New York

566
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,392
with, like, a model girlfriend

567
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:12,262
- or something.
- Well, apparently not.

568
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,698
Remember Stacy
had the total hots for him?

569
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,333
Do you remember
she saved that piece of gum

570
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,102
- that he chewed for like a year?
- Oh, yeah.

571
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,271
And she made an altar for him
with all of his pictures.

572
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,040
Oh! Do you remember
the one year that Laura

573
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,308
gave her one of his jockstraps

574
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,943
for her birthday?

575
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,545
- Yeah.
- She slept with that nasty thing.

576
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,248
Gross.

577
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,117
- What? What're you doing?
- Don't worry your little head.

578
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,986
My god, Alisa.

579
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,454
Alisa, don't.

580
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,624

581
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,459
Hey, frank.

582
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,063
- Thanks. Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Welcome.

583
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,230
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Uh! Ah!

584
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,598
- Here. I got it.
- Fuck! I did it again!

585
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,733
It's okay.
It's...

586
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,544
Looking for something?

587
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:04,548
Oh, I'm looking
for something all right.

588
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,385
The question is...

589
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,253
Do you have what I want?

Fucking tick.

- Yeah, you like that?
- Yeah.

595
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,120
- That's good.
- Yeah.

596
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:30,367
Oh, by the way, Stacy says hi.

597
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,636
<i>Whew!</i>

598
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:34,504
Wait!
What the fuck?

<i>Hey!</i>

Oh!

602
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,848
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

603
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,716
What the fuck?

604
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,553
Frank, let's go!
Get in the car, frank!

00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,192
Kim?
Let's go! Drive!

606
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,596
Woo-whoo!

607
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,131
Let's go!
Drive!

608
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,299

- Okay.

609

- Hurry!
- What? I'm driving.

610
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,635
What the hell did you do, Alisa?

611
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,637
Just getting Stacy
her birthday gift.

612
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,607
- You didn't.
- Kevin bowman's football helmet!

613
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,243
- Whoo!
- Are you crazy?

614
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,679
- He's gonna call the cops and
get us arrested. - For what?

615
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,147
This isn't
"Thelma and Louise."

616
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,748
I didn't rob a store.

617
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,151
I just, you know,
took a little memento.

618
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:24,287
Still we could've gotten
into a lot trouble, Alisa.

619
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,691
I can't believe this.

620
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,593
Yeah, if you want
your own stupid thrills,

621
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,594
do it on your own time.

622
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:33,130
Don't rope us into it.

623
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,698
You know what?

624
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,566
Fuck you guys.

625
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,736
Stacy would've
totally been into this.

626
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,671
You two need to learn
to chill the fuck out

627
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,374
and have a little fun.

628
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,909
It'll do you both some good.

629
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,213
Stupid.

630
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,214
- Ugh!
- Ow!

631
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,415
- Sorry.
- Frank!

632
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,584
Ah, sorry.

633
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,753
They're gaining on us.

634
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,222
Kim: <i>Nobody's gaining
on us, frank.</i>

635
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,228
( Sighs )

636
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,300
- I miss Stacy.
- Ugh!

637
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:12,302
Sorry.

638
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,771
It was never quite the same
after she died.

639
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:20,310
Sure. You had loads of fun
with Stacy.

640
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:21,745
Like the time she locked you
in the boys bathroom

641
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,180
with Johnny Dale.

642
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,548
Said you needed
seven minutes in hell

643
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,684
to make sure you really wanted
to go to heaven.

644
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,886
That wasn't really the time
I was thinking about.

645
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,922
And the time freshman year
when she unzipped your skirt

646
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:34,925
and your hello kitty underwear
was showing all day.

647
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,394
- That wasn't exactly when...
- Or, no, no, no, no, no.

648
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,728
The time she threw you
in the pool.

649
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,697
You were wearing
that white dress.

650
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,534
That was the first day I saw
your tight wet, hot pink bra.

651
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,869
So naughty.

652
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,504
That doesn't sound like
a very Christian color.

653
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:48,838
Stop it, okay?
My mom saw that.

654
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,440
I got in big trouble
over that bra.

655
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,742
- Do you remember when she...
- I hated Stacy!

656
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,848
Maybe that's why
you lied to your parents

657
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,851
about going on
a Christian retreat.

658
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,355
So you could take the car,
go to Stacy's grave.

659
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,659
Make sure she was really dead.

660
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,929
Why are you always
so mean to me?

661
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,531
I'm just saying it like it is.

662
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,533
You guys, stop!

663
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:20,370
- You know you're being a bitch.
- Ooh, Kim just said bitch!

664
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:21,471
You know, Jesus heard that.

665
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,673
You better ask for forgiveness.

666
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,311
- Oh... ah!
- Ow! What the fuck?

667
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,447
Are you trying to get us killed?

668
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,518
Seriously, Laura?

669
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,686
You need to choose

670
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,021
who you want to be friends with

671
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:40,490
because after this trip,
I am done with her.

672
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,530
Ooh, nice friends you got.

673
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,399
- Can you get out of the car?
- What?

674
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,337
What, wha... wha...
What're you doing?

675
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:55,772

He could be a serial killer.

Ah! I'm with Kim

- Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

Besides, isn't it
the Christian thing to do?

700

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,913
Frank: <i>Jeffrey Dahmer!
Jeffrey Dahmer!</i>

705
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,114
<i>( Barks )</i>

706
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,486
There is no way I'm letting
him get in this car.

707
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,728
What the fuck, Kim?

708
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,930
He could be your future husband

709
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,665
for all you know.

710
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,667
Now, you'll never know.

711
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,168
I am not meeting
my future husband

712
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,570
on the side of the road.

713
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,776
Actually, that's how I met
Laura's mom.

714
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:22,111
- No, you didn't.
- Sure did.

715
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:25,114
Well, I met her at a bus stop.

716
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,983
She was still a nurse
at the time.

717
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,252
( Chuckles )

718
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,688
She was wearing
this bubblegum pink cotton

719
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,523
nurse's uniform.

720
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,592
She had her hair up in a bun,

721
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,927
and she had on these
spotless white shoes.

722
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,630
Ah, she looked like an angel.

723
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:43,032
So, you hit on her?

724
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,802
She sat next to me on the bus,
and we got to talking

725
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,837
and, well,

726
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,539
that was after
I hit her in the face.

727
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,841
So, I guess in a way,
I did hit on her.

728
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,610
( All laughing )

729
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:56,846
It was like god

730
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,682
just put her at that bus stop.

731
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,121
See, Kim?

732
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,656
Sometimes it's good to step out

733
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,725
of your comfort zone
and live a little.

734
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:11,594
Well, that was an exception.

735
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,096
Haven't you ever heard
of the expression

736
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,931
"you play with fire,
and you will get burned"?

737
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,200
Haven't you heard the expression

738
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,902
"you better use it
before it gets old"?

739
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,038
Whatever.
"To each your own."

740
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,999
Laura, ( Clears throat )
You're not hungry?

741
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,206
I'm just curious, frank.

742
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,908
Why do you always bite
that key ring?

743
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,878
Is it because of the tourettes?

744
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,014
Oh, my god. Kim, is having tact
anti-Christian or something?

745
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,616
Frank doesn't mind.

746
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,685
Do you?

747
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:09,886
I just have

748
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:11,287
never known anybody
with tourettes,

749
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,590
and I have a lot of questions.

750
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,625
And Laura's never
let us spend this much time

751
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:16,926
<i>with frank before.</i>

752
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,931
I... I'm worse around people.

753
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,933
You mean your tourettes is?

754
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:27,270
I mean, you aren't
your tourettes, right?

755
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,838
I read somewhere that it's like

756
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,173
this evil twin

757
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,709
that comes out
when you least expect it.

758
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:36,713
Like, you just can't control
what it says or does.

759
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,048
I can relate to that.

760
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,249
I just think it's really cool

761
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,784
that you can swear like a sailor

762
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,653
<i>and never get in trouble for it.</i>

763
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:44,921
( Laughs )

764
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,889
Well, I... I wouldn't
say never.

765
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,060
Can I hear what you're like

766
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,862
without the key ring just...

767
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,330
Just once?

768
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,013
He needs a trigger.

769
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,319
Shut up, you little bitch.

770
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:22,025
Fuck you, cocksucker.

771
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,161
- Damn it!

772
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,696
Oh.

Hey!

776
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,707
That is no way to address
teenage girls.

777
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,108
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself

778
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,443

Bitch picnic, bitch picnic,

782
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,817
Stop it right now!

783
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,820
This is a public place
with children present!

Stop it!
He can't help it!

( Yelling, barks )

786
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,195
Sorry.

787
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,170
I'm sorry.

788
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:10,339
I didn't know
you were afflicted.

789
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:11,908
But you really
shouldn't be in a public place

790
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,910
with kids present.

791
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:15,378
And you need to learn
how to pick on someone

792
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,447
your own size.

793
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:18,981
It was a mistake.

794
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Dickhead.

795
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,722
Sorry.

I have tourettes, too.

797

Asshole.

00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,198
Sorry. Me, too.

What she said.

800
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,870

- I was?

- Totally.

good digs at him.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Give me some five.

814
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,274
of a little danger now and then.

815
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:21,944
Oh, I... I'm not thirsty.

- No. No, it's for your eye.

Do you know Laura's plans
for after we get back?

823
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,000
She got a volleyball scholarship

824
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,202
to my college,

825
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,537
but lately she said
she's not going.

826
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,407
Ah, I don't know
what her plans are,

827
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:27,143
but, heh, she's going.

828
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,314
<i>Good.</i>

829
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:33,482
It's a little selfish of me,

830
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,384
but I was kind of afraid
I'd have to go alone.

831
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,855
It's a private
religious college,

832
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,323
did you know?

833
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,058
Well, they've got a lot
of secular majors for Laura

00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,292
to choose from,

835
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,962
but, my future's
already been decided.

836
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,533
I'll be taking religion classes,

837
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:53,169
so I can be a teacher
in one of my church's schools.

838
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,341
I think I'll be good at it.

839
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,510
I hope I like it.

840
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,552
How do you think people know

what they're supposed
to do with their lives?

842
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,023

teach you that.

843
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:16,359
Mm. I... I...
I wouldn't know.

I... I've never had a job.

I live off disability

847
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,902
and a trust fund
from my parents.

848

851
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,314
you really wanted to do
something else?

852
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,653
Do you think
that voice in my heart is god?

853
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:45,655
You got me.

854
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:49,425
I'm currently not
on speaking terms with god.

855
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,594
Because of Cathy?

856
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,303
Is she okay?
Laura, I mean.

857
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:05,007

859

but...

860
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,248
Even before then,
she seemed kind of...

861
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,718
Forever sad ever since...

It's scary enough going off into
college out into the real world.

01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:32,988
Oh, my god.
Frank, what're you doing?

1057
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,697
Is he a friend of yours?

1058
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:42,831
Yeah.

Wake up.
Alisa's not here.

1072
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,878
I didn't eat the cookie.

1073
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,881
- What?
- Hey, Alisa's not here.

1074
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:35,050
Oh, my god!
Someone killed her.

1075
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,451
She could be
lying in a ditch somewhere.

1076
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:37,819
I told her not to go.

1077
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:40,055
- I told her, didn't I?
- Ow.

1078
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:41,790
Who... who... who is dead?

1079
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:42,991
Alisa!

1080
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:46,161
Oh, check the car.

1081
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,063
( Clears throat )

1082

<i>( Snoring continues )</i>

1083
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:00,542
Is she alive?

1084
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:03,245
Oh, she's more than alive
all right.

1085
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,247
I had to fight her off
the whole night.

1086
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:08,784
Latte for Kim.
Espresso for Laura.

1087
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,385
Hey, is frank up?

1088
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:14,856
You actually
talked to Alisa last night?

1089
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:16,525
Yeah, is that unusual?

1090
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:19,161
Like a conversation?
About us?

1091
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:23,165
Yeah, we talked all night.
We watched the sun come up.

1092
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,002
You are the cute hitchhiker?

1093
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:29,504
Well, I do prefer
to be called by my name.

1094
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,039
Vinnie.

1095
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,374
You must be frank.

1096
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:33,875
It's herbal tea.

1097
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:36,344
Alisa told me you had
the tourettes.

1098
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,580
That means no caffeine, right?

1099
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:40,148
She wasn't sure what you drank
in the morning,

1100
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,983
so I figured
that was the best bet.

1101
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,330
( Moans )

1102
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,966
What're you staring at?

1103
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,434
( Sighs )

1104
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,004
Shit.

1105
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,006
Good morning, Princess.

1106
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,174
( Sighs )

1107
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,218
So, what's your boyfriend's
name again?

1108
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,921
Vinnie.
And he's not my boyfriend.

1109
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,257
Then why are you staring at them

1110
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:23,625
like a jealous girlfriend?

1111
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:27,162
I don't give a shit
what they do together.

1112
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:29,130
Can we just leave already?

1113
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:32,567
Mm-hmm.

1114
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,503
- Hey.
- Would you believe it,

1115
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:38,073
Vinnie's heading
to the same place we are.

1116
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:39,875
Oh.

1117
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:41,243
Oh, well, not the cemetery.

1118
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,011
I'm hitching to my aunt's farm.

1119
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,546
It's only about, what,
like, 20 miles away

1120
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:45,881
from where you guys are headed.

1121
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,049
And it's a big house.

1122
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,986
You guys can all stay there,
and it's miles from anywhere.

1123
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:53,121
Frank can swear
as loud as he likes,

1124
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,589
and he won't even
get kicked out.

1125
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:00,228
He's going our way.
He needs a ride.

1126
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,663
So...

1127
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,904
- Yeah, I don't see why not.
- Ooh! Yay, you can come.

1128
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,205
( Giggles )

1129
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:16,211
Well, there's not gonna be
enough room in the car.

1130
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,280
You know frank and his ticks.

1131
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:20,548
Oh, I... I don't mind
getting hit in the face.

1132
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,083
I mean, that's what
seven years of bad luck

1133
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,219
- does to a guy.
- ( Giggles )

1134
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,022
It's fine, right?

1135
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,691
Um...

1136
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:32,494
Oh, look, you know,
I get it, guys.

1137
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,663
I don't want to cause
any troubles, so...

1138
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:40,568
Ah, wait, Vinnie,
just hang on a minute.

1139
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:45,273
- Kim: What?
- I don't want him in the car.

1140
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,276
Why not?
He's cute and he's nice.

1141
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,145
Total boyfriend material.

1142
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,714
He's a guy I hooked up with
last night.

1143
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,249
That's it.

1144
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,619
And we can stay
with his aunt for free.

1145
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,955
I'm sorry. No.

1146
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:01,957
I'm not spending hours
trapped in a car

1147
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:05,727
with some random guy
I hooked up with.

1148
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,395
It's not happening.

1149
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,034
Hey, Vinnie.
( Clicks tongue )

1150
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,102
Let's go.

1151
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:17,272
<i>( Music playing )</i>

1152
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:32,053
( Horn honks )

1153
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,360
- ( Shuts music off )
- We're gonna play a game.

1154
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:40,295
Well, no,
it's not really a game.

1155
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:42,297
We're gonna go around and say
what's on our bucket list.

1156
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:43,631
Won't that be fun?

1157
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,633
Really?
A bucket list?

1158
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,503
- Can it be anymore lame?
- I'll go first.

1159
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,306
I want to teach
in my church's school,

1160
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:54,209
volunteer in Africa for a year
and start an orphanage.

1161
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:57,379
I want you to shut up
for five minutes.

1162
01:06:57,381 --> 01:06:58,380
Come on, this is important.

1163
01:06:58,382 --> 01:06:59,414
We could all die today

1164
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00,715
and have all these regrets.

1165
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,484
So it's good
we list them all down now.

1166
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:04,185
Well, if we all died today,

1167
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,489
then your stupid list
wouldn't matter, would it?

1168
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,024
Vinnie:
<i>I'll go.</i>

1169
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,525
( Clears throat )

1170
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,495
I want to brew beer,
start my own brewery,

1171
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:16,498
and then get married
and have a huge family.

1172
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,167
Awe, that's so nice.

1173
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,204
All right, fine.
I'll go.

1174
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,273
I wanna live every day
like it's my last

1175
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:26,708
which is what
I've been doing anyway.

1176
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,045
I wanna get a Harley
and ride around the world.

1177
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,579
Where will you go?

1178
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:33,448
It doesn't matter.

1179
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,784
It's all about the journey
and not the destination.

1180
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:38,686
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
I'd totally do that.

1181
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:40,088
I mean, you know,

1182
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,656
before I settle down
and everything.

1183
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:43,224
Yeah, I'm not settling down.

1184
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,393
To be stuck in
one place forever.

1185
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,561
Ugh.

1186
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,198
It sucks being stuck in hell.

1187
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,600
O-Kay.
What about you, frank?

1188
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:55,303
Well, ( Chuckles )

1189
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,705
I... I... I've never really
thought about it.

1190
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,574
Stupid, crazy bitch.
( Grunting )

1191
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:03,378
( Clears throat ) I've always
just lived day by day.

1192
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,414
With my condition
there's certain limitations.

1193
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:10,218
So, I... I just stay at home
and watch TV, read,

1194
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,820
listen to my music.

1195
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:15,323
I... I don't really dream
of doing anything.

1196
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:17,659
Yeah, but if you
could do anything,

1197
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,828
what would you do?

1198
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,563
Well...

1199
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:26,401
I have always been curious
to try one thing.

1200
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:27,702
What?

1201
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,240
To drive.

1202
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:34,742
To drive?
That's it?

1203
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,211
( Laughs )

1204
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:38,213
If you could do anything
in this world

1205
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:40,115
and you just want to drive?

1206
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,150
Yeah, sit behind the wheel

1207
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:43,585
<i>and have my foot on the pedal</i>

1208
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:46,387
and just drive.

1209
01:08:46,389 --> 01:08:48,389
Fucking asshole.
( Grunting continues )

1210
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,492
- ( Clears throat )
- ( Alisa laughs )

1211
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:52,260
What do you want to drive?

1212
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:56,331
Mm, anything.
A car, a truck, a bus.

1213
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,600
Anything with wheels
and a motor.

1214
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:01,603
Well, let's do it then.
Laura, let him drive.

1215
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,538
There's no way
I'm letting frank drive.

1216
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,174
Oh, come on.
It's his dying wish.

1217
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:08,443
- Let the man drive.
- <i>I'm sorry, frank,</i>

1218
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:10,612
but I don't think
my parents would be too happy

1219
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,147
if I let you drive the car.

1220
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,816
Nah, it... it's okay.
It's just a stupid wish.

1221
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,818
Fucking crazy bitches.

1222
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,754
- ( Clears throat )
- Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

1223
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:26,161
Well, what about you, Laura?
What's on your bucket list?

1224
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:28,163
Uh...

1225
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:29,731
I don't know.

1226
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:32,433
I just graduated high school,

1227
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:34,836
I've worked really hard,
and mom's was sick.

1228
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,938
I haven't had time to think
about what comes next.

1229
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,873
You plan on going to college?

1230
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,744
We'll see. Um...

1231
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:44,512
I just want to make sure
frank is settled

1232
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,681
- <i>before I go.</i>
- ( Laughs ) Oh, she's going.

1233
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,650
There's no question about it.

1234
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:50,818
Well, it's my life, isn't it?

1235
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,853
All right.

1236
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,688
Say you don't go to college,

1237
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,356
what... what're you gonna do?

1238
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,425
I don't know, frank,
but I'll figure it out.

1239
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:58,960
The problem is,

1240
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:01,329
you spend so much time
thinking about everyone else,

1241
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:03,331
you haven't had any time
to think about yourself.

1242
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,633
- Dumb bitch.
- It's true, Laura.

1243
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,503
Not the dumb bitch,
but the part before that.

1244
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:10,805
Yeah, I mean,
frank can take of himself.

1245
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:11,906
Right, frank?

1246
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:13,374
What is this?
An intervention?

1247
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,243
We're just saying that,
you know,

1248
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,511
you need some time
to take care yourself.

1249
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:18,780
- Right, guys?
- Uh-huh.

1250
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:22,784
Has everyone aired out
their grievances?

1251
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:25,486
'Cause we're not talking
about this anymore.

1252
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:39,334
Kids: <i>( Chanting ) Frank!
Frank! Frank!</i>

1253
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:41,736
- Ow!
- <i>( Chanting continues )</i>

1254
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,705
We're here, frank.

1255
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:02,290
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- I got it.

1256
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:04,292
The best place to grow up.

1257
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:05,760
Aunt Flossie!

1258
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:08,630
Kim:
You got it?

1259
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:11,599
Alisa:
<i>Oh, have fun, guys.</i>

1260
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,568
You coming?

1261
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:23,044
Cock fucking
son of a slut whore.

1262
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:24,412
( Barks )

1263
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,287
Vinnie!
( Laughing )

1264
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:36,424
Aunt Flossie,
I'd like you to meet Alisa.

1265
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:37,992
Hi, nice to meet you.

1266
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,528
- Are you his girlfriend?
- Oh, no, no,

1267
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,531
well, I... I mean,
not yet anyway.

1268
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,466
Well, welcome Vinnie's
not yet girlfriend.

1269
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,467
Thanks so much for having us.

1270
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,468
And these are her friends.

1271
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,469
This is Kim.

1272
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

1273
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,306
Vinnie:
<i>Laura and...</i>

1274
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:52,940
- bitch tractor fucker! (
Barking continues ) -<i> Frank.</i>

1275
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,642
Well, aren't you a colorful one.

1276
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,445
Welcome home.

1277
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,380
She's says that to everybody,
but it's true.

1278
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:01,916
For the next couple of days
consider this home.

1279
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,651
Or forever long you wanna stay.

1280
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,952
Come on.

1281
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:28,476
Come in, come in,
and make yourself comfortable.

1282
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,645
Vinnie will take you upstairs
and show you your bedrooms.

1283
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:31,979
I'm gonna make
a little bit of tea.

1284
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,815
Thank you.
Wow.

1285
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,962
Get that apple out.

1286
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:49,964
Now, you stay here, all right?
You don't say a word.

1287
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:52,133
I don't want to hear you.
I don't want to smell you.

1288
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:55,136
And for the life of god,
keep that mouth closed.

1289
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:56,671
Okay, now,
just stay right there.

1290
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:58,806
Don't you screw this up for me.

1291
01:12:58,808 --> 01:12:59,841
Okay.

1292
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:08,516
Hello, hello.

1293
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:10,518
Oh, am I interrupting?
You got company?

1294
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,520
- Come in, come in, come in.
- Oh. Yeah,

1295
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:14,389
I just wanted to drop by

1296
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,924
and bring you some apples
from the trees.

1297
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:19,093
Aw, thank you,
preacher Alexander.

1298
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:21,462
Well, you keep baking
those apple pies

1299
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:22,964
and I'll keep
bringing them over.

1300
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:25,032
Stupid Jesus lover bitch!
( Clears throat )

1301
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:28,903
Sorry.

1302
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:39,046
Fucking shit eating whoreface
Bible trash!

1303
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:42,683
( Grunting )

1304
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:56,964
Well, my offer still stands,
Flossie.

1305
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:59,500
And you know I'm offering
more than market value

1306
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:00,802
for this house.

1307
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,773
I don't think we should be
talking about this now.

1308
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:10,745
You're not seriously gonna sell
the house to Puggis, are you?

1309
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:13,915
Your uncle promised Puggis

1310
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:17,585
that if he would
stay and work the farm

1311
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:18,886
and take care of it,

1312
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:21,222
he would sell it to him
for a lower price.

1313
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:23,191
Yeah, but he's not
taking care of it,

1314
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:25,193
<i>and besides, you know
uncle is in no condition</i>

1315
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:27,061
<i>to be making those decisions.</i>

1316
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:30,131
You know Puggis manipulated him.

1317
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,499
I don't know that.

1318
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:40,641
Oh, g...
You fucking freak show.

1319
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,877
Why didn't you stay
in your mama's womb?

1320
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,078
<i>Oh.</i>

1321
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,713
Stupid fucking
white trash bitch!

1322
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,048
- ( Clears throat )
- Dear god...

1323
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,951
What the hell is go...
Ah, shit.

1324
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:56,791
Are you the preacher's son?

1325
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:59,594
Y... yeah, yeah.
I'm his son, John.

1326
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:03,097
Wh... why hasn't anyone
fixed your teeth?

1327
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,966
( Sniffs )

1328
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:08,669
My... my pa says it's the way
god wants me to be.

1329
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,971
So...

1330
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,606
I already told you,
preacher man,

1331
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:12,807
she ain't sellin' to you.

1332
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:13,841
Well, that's for her to decide,

1333
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,510
don't you think?

1334
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:18,212
After all I done for you,
you and your husband.

1335
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:19,747
<i>Is this how you gonna treat me?</i>

1336
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,816
He made me a promise,
a fucking promise.

1337
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:24,652
This is her house to sell,
so she's making the call.

1338
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:26,554
The offer's good until Monday.

1339
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:29,557
- You think... - y'all go
get the hell outta here!

1340
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:31,058
Go on!

1341
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,895
She ain't got nothin'
to think about, preacher.

1342
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,065
( Door slams )

1343
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:39,867
Fucking Satan
worshiping asshole!

1344
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,736
Hey, don't swear
in front of my son!

1345
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:43,604
In fact, I don't want you
talkin' to him, neither.

1346
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:46,607
Why didn't you stay put
like I told you to...

1347
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:49,777
Fix his fucking teeth!

1348
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:51,746
I'm not sorry.

1349
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,919
Your husband made me a promise
on his deathbed.

1350
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,253
<i>You got to honor that.</i>

1351
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:01,789
Oh, yeah, you're the one
to talk about honor.

1352
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,791
Making him promise you
to sell the house

1353
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:06,093
for almost nothing
on his last breath.

1354
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:09,263
This is between
your aunt and me.

1355
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:12,033
You ain't got
nothin' to do with this, boy.

1356
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:15,870
<i>If I ever see that preacher
around here again...</i>

1357
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,338
There's gonna be trouble.

1358
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:21,709
( Door opens, closes )

1359
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:27,582
You ever meet someone
who doesn't give a fuck?

1360
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:30,151
Well, I don't give a fuck.

1361
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:33,254
You wanna bully someone?
You bully me.

1362
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:42,196
Get off me, you retard.

1363
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:47,034
<i>You nut!</i>

1364
01:16:49,806 --> 01:16:51,238
Don't worry, aunt Flossie.

1365
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,974
Everything's gonna be okay.

1366
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:59,146
I don't know what to do.

1367
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:01,849
Just leave it to me.

1368
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:04,652
I'll take care of everything.

1369
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:08,789
<i>( Knocking on door )</i>

1370
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,292
