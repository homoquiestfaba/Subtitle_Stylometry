You always think that the end will occur.

28

Unfortunately, God knows everything.

If this happens  last year, you know before
mother drank, you'd be home now

We all have at home, such as family or something

I got married at a very young age...

Yes, yes, I'm fine.

116
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,730

I just feel a little disappointed, that's all.

This is a big problem for me, all of us have the time
fun

121
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,690
Oh I'm sure you'll survive if you can.

122
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,320
It comes with both hands on the floor.

123
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,240
And the stewardess said...
"I'm sorry..."

124
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,030
You may only carry one luggage

125
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,880
I'm sorry, Captain

126
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,690
And he thinks I'm funny

Thank you.

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,440
Sounds like it is your mother talking

133
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,320
Sometimes it looks like it.

134
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,970
There is someone who saw the earthquake on the news and
try to convince people it's good news.

135
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,720
Does that make sense to you?

136
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,610
Death by Tsunami,
it beyond your shadow.

137
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,430
Children
dragged into the sea before they were aware.

138
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,160
It's hard to imagine the baby in hand.

139
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,850
And he was so sure I
save her baby.

140
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,440
But he mengikhlaskannya.
He ​​is grateful.

141
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,600
She thanked him for killing others?

142
00:12:52,310 --> 00:13:01,010
He has a chance, that night he refused
in the evacuation, and he felt God was watching.

143
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,990
And.... / Then...

144
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,710
And he tries to

145
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,710
How people see things like that, and...

146
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,420
If you look close enough, you'll see what
you're looking for.

147
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,100
And I've got a lot of work to it.

148
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,980
One of them

149
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,080
might be the truth.

150
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,930
And what about you?

151
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Do you have seen the village?

152
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,410
I see everyone
not care about the small things.

153
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,170
And if he asks why?

154
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I know why.

155
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,190
Tsunami.

156
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
I know what I think

157
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,960
Not. No, I do not do it.

158
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,770
If you want an amazing thing
as it happens, and...

159
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,570
Do you mind if it is
a stranger at the airport?

160
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,190
Oh...

161
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,260
Why laugh? ./ Oh, no.

162
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,030
What?

163
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,830
Oh, just thinking about that joke.
The man makes me laugh.

164
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,590
Ray !. / You mean Captain Steele?

165
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,410
Just in front of others.

166
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,390
Really?

167
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,320
So he is?

168
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,940
No, not yet.

169
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,800
But, we would spend time together
in London.

170
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,940
True?
Why do not you tell me?

171
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,700
Chloe, where are you going?

172
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,550
Ah, how many details I beg

173
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,430
I really need someone to talk to today in

174
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,550
Thank you.

175
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,370

It is still in the development stage

265
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,850
That's about mechanical engineer or something else

266
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,900

He ​​looks very upset because he had to go.

Yes, and anyway, you're not the only one who thinks
earthquake is the end of the world.

292
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,240
There is a mad woman who thinks like that.

293
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,780
Not so true.

294
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,730
After all, Hmm...

295
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,360
He is a great guy.

296
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,290
Chloe dear...

297
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,270
I do not intend to force.

298
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,090
I know how to taste like that

299
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,740
I just want you to understand.

300
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,790

Ready for what?

304
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,570
You know...

305
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,360
Forget it.

306
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,080
Can we talk without you interrupting?

307
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,050
Mom, I just got here.

308
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,940
I'm not really prepared to talk tough
.

309
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,730
Yes, of course, now listen to me.

310
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,910
Few.

311
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,380
I pray that you come home, and I'm sure
is why God brought you here.

312
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,600
What are you saying?

313
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,220

God did not take me home, I
carrying myself.

I bought the tickets, I was on a flight
,

316
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,970
God has nothing to do with it.

317
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,120
And let me ask you something

318
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,820
If God takes me home for dad's birthday,

319
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,920
Then why did he fly to London?

320
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
Maybe it's important for us to talk

321
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,870
I do not like the taste of it

322
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,270
One thing I am sure, God is the reason why now
father is not here now

323
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,070
Chloe!

324
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,690
I'll be right back ../ Yes.

325

329
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,300

Want to ask me something?

331
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,910
Want to know how I drive?

332
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,790
Maybe where I buy my clothes?

333
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,670
How can I reach the urinal?

334
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,650
What is a urinal?

335
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,380
This is my father.

336
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,370
He plays football.

337
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,290
That's good, son.

338
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,140
Tomorrow
if he would play his hand was healed.

339
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,020
Your father played baseball on television?

340
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,870

341
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,670

Cosmo. He was my dog.

344
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,490

Father very angry. He pushed Cosmo.

00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,140
What I say unto
about the other passengers?

348
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,160
Sorry...

349
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,600
So, you're a bad man.

350
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,450
Yes.

351
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,570
You're going to give it to the child?

352
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:31,140
His father is a famous person.
I'm not sure he needs the money.

353
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,070
Do you want to go where?

354
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,720
Go out . / What can I join

What we could go to the mall? ./ Yes, we can.

359
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,210
I heard 8% of the
Americans like to go to the mall.

360
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,740
Do you think it's crazy mother.

361

What?

362
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,810
Not.

363
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,570
No, I'm just annoyed

364
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,350
Father says pastor Bruce has brainwashed her.

365
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,340
Oh, it's just a joke.

366
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,260
True?

367
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,210
I do not understand.

368
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,770
So did I..

369
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,920
So this is a little annoying.

What is it? ./ Do

371

Well, but you have to pay your bills right?

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,430
So how long Chloe in the city?

What's the problem? ./ No... I...

You want coffee? ./ Yes.

385
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,690

You were just a waste of time to keep

He never took me away.

390
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,650
So why not go alone, do not you think?

391
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,770
Hmm? Yes, yes of course.

392

Dad just has to work, it is
things that should do it, ok?

Everyone in this plane
already terrified.

Currently, it is the biggest threat on this plane
.

448

Now I'm going to ask the flight attendants to calculate the amount of your

Whatever happens to them,
we will find them.

I still have not been able to reach
anyone, so I do not know if this.

451

This incident has occurred in all planes
or just here alone, but I promise...

I Williams, reporting from flight 257

We are in the waters of Atlantis, towards London, but

478
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,960

I can not see it clearly.

483
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
Then what happened?

484
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,320
Not happen.

485
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:54,040
I just sit here and very frightened.

486
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,790
I scream scared, I do not know.

487
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:20,020
Although this sounds impossible, but it's all real
.

488
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:27,520
I'm not aware of all this.

489
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,970
Hey!

490
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,880
Return the bag to me!

491
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,700
Not!

492
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,290
Are you okay?

493

Right.

499
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,460
It's a bad trip.

500
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,430
You must move on.

501
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,160
This is not be the last.

502
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,840
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

503
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,100
Hey, hey.

504
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,970
It's okay.

505
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,840
Now sit down.

506
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,500
Wear your seat belt.

507
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,340
You'll be fine.

508
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,040
All of this does not really happen.

509
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,870
That's okay, we'll get through this.

510
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,840
All of this does not really happen.

511
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,450
Why do not you relax, just relax.

512
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,390
Try to sleep.

513
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,220
Can you tell me what you see?

514
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:33,770
All it would not make a difference.

515
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,760
Listen...

516
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,580
Did you ever see the
disappear just like that?

517
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,320
Not.

518
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,360
What is next to you?

519
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,260
Who is it?

520
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,170
I do not know, a stranger.

521
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,110
Is there anything unusual about the
is not it?

522
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,760
There are strange to us all here.

523
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,650
Get that camera out of my face.

524
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,110

Mother, please pick up the phone,
I do not know what happened.

527
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,650
Ramy, if you receive a call.

00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,660
I need you to listen, understand?

529
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,520
I know that you fear
and I'm too scared.

530
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,270

I love you.

534
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,810
I think, we should pray
for what happens here.

535
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,970
It is the same prayer...

536
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,900
A prayer?

537
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,590
Prayer to whom?

538
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,590
To God.

539
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,590
Who is God?

540
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,390
Ye God, or God I?

541
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,330
Only God.

542
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,010
You know what I think?

543
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,910
No,

544
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,810
This is the captain speaking, we
halfway again to New York.

545
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,790
Hopefully we can get through this.

546
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,740
Pak...

547
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,510
Raymie ../ Back off.

548
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,150
Hi this is Chole Stlee

549
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,830
You okay?

550
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,650
Can you calm the passengers?

551
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,620
I'll try it, but I do not know how the outcome
.

552
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,280
They must be terrified.

553
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,200
We all fear.

554
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,160
I know, I'm going to land this plane
whatever happens.

555
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,090
What is it?

556
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,840
Aircraft in 1581, this aircraft
257, did you hear?

557
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,550
Aircraft in 1581 you should be
to change lanes.

558
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,630
Tampakanya we get the problem of emergency, prepare everything.

559
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,550
Now!

560
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,150
Hello passengers, please return to your seats and place
wearing a seat belt.

561
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:47,300
Chloe  15.81, did you hear? Please replace
at 10 thousand feet altitude.

562
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,890
Damn!

563
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,750
Emergency!

564
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,500
This is Peacon 257

565
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,390
We were involved in a collision.

566
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,300
5.81 Charlie fell.

567
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,350
Our Coordinated

568
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:45,780
4-7, this is an emergency situation.

569
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,570
There is a plane that crashed,
We need a rescue team

570
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,340
Repeat, this is an emergency situation.

571
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:01,250
Come on, there must be someone out there.

572
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,910
What is wrong with you?

573
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,920
You do not believe me?

574
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,770
We are not talking about a bomb.

575
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,590
If this is a gun, it
is not from this planet.

576
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,450
What are you talking about?

577
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,350
I'm just saying, maybe they were abducted.

578
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,310
Alien?

579
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,270
Come on.

580
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,290
Can you believe this guy?

581
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,820
Is everything okay?

582
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,540
What about the other plane, what he also lost passengers
?

583
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,700
I do not know.

584
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,160
Your camera, I want you to photograph the plane's wing
captain.

585
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,160
Wendy.

586
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,950
Wendy.

587
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,070
Be careful.

588
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,900
Hey.

589
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,760
Here's the picture.

590
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,680
Looks like we got a problem.

591
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,790
6 inch gap in the aircraft wing. And spoiler disappeared

592
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,690
That's the problem.

593
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,580
What does that mean?

594
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:22,250
This will be a difficult journey.

595
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,190
We will get problems during this trip.

596
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,970
I think this it is a lucky day I

597
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,040
They've disappeared

598
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,960
They all have brought the children.

599
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,750
Are you sure?

600
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,570
I'm looking for my son.

601
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,570
I'd been talking to a doctor.

602
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,440
This is not just about suffering.

603
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,360
It occurs where where.

604
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,220
Virtually all parts of the world.

605
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:46,690
None
even one child is not disadvantaged over this incident.

606
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:57,290
We rely only on this computer tool.

607
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:05,060
Camera, I lose
Auto pilot can you check the back of the wing of this plane?

608
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,020
Listen

609
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,850
Makusdmu fuel.

610
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:13,640
We are at an altitude of 3000 feet, we
can not refuel granted.

611
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,230
Perfect.

612
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,460
Look, we have to go back.
We must return.

613
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,490
We will return safely. No, I mean,
I want to go back home to see my baby.

614
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,320
We have lost a lot of fuel,
how we can survive this problem?

615
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:53,850
We should be able to return safely ../
Calm down, nothing will happen.

616
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,670
Oh, look at that fire.

617
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,480
Now you know, that we will die.

618
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,460
Back off!

619
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:11,180
Hey, everybody, listen to me!

620
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:15,010
No one will be dead, you hear me
? ./ Everything back seat.

621
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,000
True captain Now

622
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,010
I want you all to remain calm.

623
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,690
There was fire coming out of the
side of the wing of this plane.

624
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,310
Is that fire burning wings,
or simply remove the fire alone?

625
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:57,360
Removing the fire, and the flames were huge.

626
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,340
It was bound to happen due to a fuel leak.

627
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,930
What? ./ It is derived from
leaking fuel.

628
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,110
That's what caused the fire was out.

629
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,890
Let's go back  ../
We must look at the situation first.

630
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:14,570
It could happen here or here.

631
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,510
So what will we do?

632
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,270
Let it burn.
Only that we can do.

633
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,250
The flames had dimmed.

634
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:51,010
Fuel level will not change.

635
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,990
Do it marked
we've run out? ./ We do not know.

636
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,720
And I ../ What a loss ladder?

637
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:04,460
The elevator. It seems we have reached the New York
two hours late

638
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,200
I could not move it.

639
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,150
You're going to try to do that?

640
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,070
At least I will try.

641
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,990
I've tried.

642
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,840
We will do another plan,
because that part has been exposed.

643
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:23,780
You have to talk to the passengers
what is going on.

644
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,760
I do not know about the passengers.

645
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:28,460
But I know this.

646
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,460
I am the person who flew it.

647
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,280
Excuse me. I was just thinking,

648
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,210
Where's disappearance?

649
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,940
What?

650
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,820
I mean ..

651
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,870
Why do we not get to see it all?

652
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,770
Like, you know, it's not visible.

653
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:39,620
It was an annihilation.

654
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:43,310
Is not this more crazy than annihilation?

655
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,820
Hello, this is an automated message service.
You must be mengevakusikan themselves.

656

How close did you know him?

659
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,960
What?

660
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,760
How close did you get to know him?

661
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,650
Not too close. She's just a friend.

662
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,590
Look goods goods goods goods ../ what?

663
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:42,430
Whatever. Find just what you get and
can bring to me.

664

I beg. / Ok

665
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,590
We have a problem anymore with the flight.

666
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:46,220
Please fasten your seat belts, we
at an altitude of 1000 feet with a latitude 1000

667
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,680
What did you get?
What did you get? Quick take here.

668
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,560
Why do you need all this?

669
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,390
It's all crazy, and the whole world thinks
crazy.

670
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,270
What are you talking about?

671
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,180
I think I know the cause.

672
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,970
How can we know where its existence?

673
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,610
What do you mean?

674
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,660
What if we pass through holes caterpillars,

675
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:41,520
and into a space of time, we could be in
different time dimension of human existence.

676
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,260
What if that happens?

677
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,250
It was crazy!

678
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,260
Stop! Enough is enough, all of you!

679
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,280
I know what happened here.

680
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,050
Do you know?

681
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,940
How much are they paying you?

682
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,890
What are you talking about?

Shut up, shut up!

Mom, who's your husband? Just tell us that.

I promise you, I've never met your husband

What is going on?

696
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:33,450
Mrs , look, I do not know what this is...

Ray, what happened to you?

700
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:43,960
Why are you talking like this?

701
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:47,670
You've never talked about God before.

702

Where does the  this?

My wife

705
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,380
Miss, I beg you!

706
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:20,310
Forget about him, ok?

707
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,170
Calm down,

708
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,250
In no part of any of this.
Todongkan weapon on me alone

709
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,150
I did not do anything,

710
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:30,880

711
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,830
Miss, I beg you!
Todongkan arms to me!

That's good, ok?

714
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:43,340
Now, just tell me what you think would happen
?

715
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,230
He tried to take my daughter from me.

716
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,190
He thought he would be
do that, right?

717
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,920
He took my daughter, then...

718
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,000
I fell asleep,

719
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:59,600
someone must have put something in the drink
I, I should have known he would do this.

720
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,520
He ​​can not do it when you fall asleep.

721
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,600
Not possible.

722
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,310
The aircraft landed while I was asleep,

723
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,140
he picked it up and pay you
all to lie to me.

724
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,060
I can not lose him, I could not.

725
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,880
You need to relax.

726
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,730
I'm always awake.

727
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:21,800
This aircraft has not landed.

728
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,650
No one got out of this plane.

729
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,610
Then where is he?

730
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,180
I can not lose him, I
can not, just that I've got him!

731
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:38,110
You're thinking I'm crazy,
what should I say?

732
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,070
If he disappear?

733
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,050
I know where he is.

734
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,700
Pastor Barnes?

735
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,690
Chloe...

736
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,400
Hey.... / Oh, no...

737
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,460
Oh, thank God you're still here.

738
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:24,300
I was so scared, when I saw
they're gone I'm afraid...

739
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:29,040
He does so, like
promise, just a blink of the eye

740
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,720
What?

741
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,810
Is true...

742
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,820
Then why are you still here?

743
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,290
It is in the Bible.

744
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,140
My parents sent me to
camp in the summer time,

745
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,090
everyone is talking about this.

746
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:54,750
They say that one day
millions of people will just disappear.

747
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:55,780
Millions?

748
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,740
Moreover, they say?

749
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,560
I do not remember.

750
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,580
It's been a long time.

751
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,370
What did you say, this act of the devil?

752
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,540
Not.

753
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,380
It is the Lord.

754
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,130
Do not tell me you believe this.

755
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,140
It does not matter what I believe.

756
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,150
Where are they? Where did they go?

757
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,860
Go to heaven.

758
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:23,740
Kim  true

759
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,610
What do you mean?

760
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,550
Maybe I was really mad.

761
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,380
No you're not.

762
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:34,230
Maybe he's better off without
I ../ Do not say it.

763
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,070
No, do not!

764
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,080
Please, do not!

765
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:41,010
Maybe he's better off without me.

766
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,860
You have to listen to me now, do not do this.

767
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,650
You can not give up.

768
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,420
Do you have any children, Mr. Williams?

769
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,310
No, I do not have.

770
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:56,380
But I have a mother.

771
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:01,020
ill, father
I've tried everything, doctors, drugs.

772
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,010
But it was all to no avail.

773
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,000
I came home from school one day,

774
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,850
and I found him.

775
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,710
He just lay there,

776
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:13,610
silent, do not you do that to Katie.

777
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:20,440
I may not know what is happening
these days, but this is not the fault of Katie,

778
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,100
what do you hear me?

779
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,250
Yes.

780
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,200
If he's out there right now,

781
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:27,970
see us.

782
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:36,490
Yes, that's good.

783
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,450
Give me that.

784
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,980
Hey, this is not about us.

785
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,700
It's about the truth.

786
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,690
You have to focus on the truth.

787
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,770
That actually, Ray?

788
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:02,550
Are you serious? lya.

789
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:05,440
This is not about the past
us, it's about this time.

790
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:08,190
What happened to this plane today.

791
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,140
Could happen in everywhere, now also

792
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:15,080
So they are all in heaven, the conclusions.

793
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:17,870
Without talking to anyone else outside of this plane.

794
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,720
You will follow the explanation that comes to your head.

795
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,640
I already knew this would come.

796
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,550
In all details

797
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,670
How is it possible

798
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,390
But the way it happened,
how they disappeared,

799
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:35,280
Even the way their clothes are still there.

800
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,090
The details are perfect.

801
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,940
How can he know that?

802
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,080
Think about it.

803
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,910
Why did not you think about this?

804
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,680
You lied to me about your wife,

805
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,500
Do you lie to your wife about this flight.

806
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:52,480
You even lied to his own daughter.

807
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,330
Seems that you can lie to everyone in your life,

808
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,130
and now you're asking me to seek God.

809
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,130
Hattie.

810
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,730
You do not understand.

811
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:15,540
You're here every day.

812
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,500
You work here, preaching here.

813
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,270
Not what counted.

814
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,450
What do you mean?

815
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:25,040
I know all the words, I could
cite all the chapters, but it was not enough.

816
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,890
You have to believe.

817
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:28,900
Believe?

818
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:30,860
Believe in what?

819
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,840
In God who killed my father?

820
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:41,400
God who took me from my mother and sisters of this world?
God who crashed the plane and destroyed the city?

821
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:43,260
He took them to protect them.

822
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,310
From what?

823
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,100
From the darkest period in the history of this world.

824
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,210
Murder, war...

825
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,840
And 7 years of darkness, they took him

826
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,850
And what we are all that's left?

827
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:59,530
What about me? What should I do?

828
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,560
This is not about what we do, it's about
requesting amnesty and surrender our lives...

829
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:04,550
Stop it!

830
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:10,160
God the mother I'm talking about,
will not ever do something like this.

831
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,190
Chloe, I beg...

832
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,970
Listen to me.

833
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,890
Dengarkanmu?

834
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,760
Why should I do that?

835
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,900
You do not even listen to yourself.

836
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,140
Are you okay Marshal?

837
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:41,930
Yes.

838
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:44,880
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

839
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,700
Peacon 257  This is the control tower

840
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,450
This is Peacon 257,
call control tower

841
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,400
257  This is
Peacon marcus, are you there?

842
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:58,210
Marcus, I'm 20 minutes outside of JFK,
I have to spin. Where are you?

843
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,000
You're a loss how many victims?

844
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,130
So it happens everywhere?

845
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,830
The whole planet friend

846
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,700
No one knows how many
, but millions

847
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,560
seems to be no way out.

848
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,710
What about my family?

849
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:17,420
I need you to call
Irene, make sure they are safe

850
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,360
How are you feeling?

851
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,400
Critical. I would be very lucky if achieving

852
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:26,160
Listen, all aircraft landing everywhere,
is not possible if you're landing at JFK

853
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,870
How Werdia Luke?

854
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,020
Sorry, Ray!

855
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:30,810
So where do I go?

856
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,900
You should land.

857
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,680
Marcus, I could not land

858
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,660
We'll let you know, when it's ready

859
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:41,450
It is not possible, you have to talk to them
. clear the way for us.

860
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:44,200
Marcus?

861
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:46,120
Marcus!

862
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:56,820
JFK tower, this Peacon 257, I'm in the emergency fuel shortages
, I need a foundation, I repeat, I need grounding.

863
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,080
So...

864
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:39,220
Is there a backup plan?

865
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,040
We do not have it.

866
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,710
We're not just a shortage of fuel, but gas as well.

867
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:50,590
JFK is the nearest airport, we
will be lucky to get there.

868
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,580
We only have one choice,

869
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:55,460
I hope they clean up the runway
and they do it quickly.

870
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,310
What about the sea? ./ I do not know.

871
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:01,220
We hit the water, I do not know what
this plane will survive.

872
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:10,760
We can not, we can not
harm these people.

873
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:12,840
Hey...

874
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,420
Are you okay?

875
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:22,330
You probably do not remember me,

876
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:29,150
In your father's office you sit at a table
yellow.

877
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:35,690
I remember thinking, this guy definitely
wants everything the best.

878
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,860
They have a small plastic table.

879
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,410
But when you're on the table, the table becomes a table
as the best among others.

880
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,280
Sometimes I also think like that.

881
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,100
Well...

882
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,990
At least he tried.

883
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:55,000
And I have a daughter too.

884
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,710
I mean, he's big now, he's married now
,

885
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,530
she never existed in my office desk.

886
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,530
To be honest, I was always too busy,

887
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:07,520
I hardly ever see him again.

888
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:15,110
You know, before all this happened, I
never even thought of him.

889
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:21,770
I wish I could say now that I do,
but I think about money, and jobs.

890
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,630
Maybe this is the best .

891
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:29,650
I'm sorry...

892
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,470
You know what he said about heaven
?

893
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:37,370
Although I really wanted to see it,

894
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,170
time I came home I
hope he was not there.

895
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:08,090
I need you to look for me.

896
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,880
I'm trying.

897
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:16,510
I'm sure this is uh... ended more fun than in the
plane.

898
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,580
I can understand that.

899
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:27,020
Jim to the tower, do you hear me?

900
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,940
We are leading towards the beach.

901
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,890
Our fuel is almost exhausted.

902
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,040
I need a path to a clean landing.

903
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,820
I repeat, I need
path to a clean landing.

904
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:38,670
Listen to me...

905
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,540
I control the plane with many passengers here.

906
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,510
I do not have nothing, not
no flag, no elevators.

907
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,540
And if this run correctly,
occurrence can not be repeated.

908
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,430
I need to refuel.

909
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,990
Oh...

910
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,810
Damn...

911
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:22,820
There reply?

912
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:25,570
He who controls consolenya.

913
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,670
What else? What can I say.

914
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,570
He turned.

915
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,240
I should not leave him today.

916
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,290
You do not know.

917
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,280
All I know, he came to meet me and I
go.

918
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:42,070
I left it alone.

919
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,850
Only God knows what he went through
down there.

920
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,780
He loves you, right? He will understand.

921
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:59,320
I can not let this be the last
thing for us.

922
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,030
I just can not.

923
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,940
I must tell the truth to him.

924
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:12,690
And I have to tell him that this is not the fault of his mother
, everything is my fault.

925
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:19,510
Every time I call God, I turned.

926
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,850
Mother...

927
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:25,620
I do not know if you can hear what is not...

928
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,430
But there is what I'm saying.

929
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:34,460
This morning
I feel we as a family will be destroyed.

930
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,140
And I blame you.

931
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:41,120
And I know that I hurt you.

932
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:44,000
Father, forgive me

933
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,680
I'm so sorry.

934
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:06,870
Hello?

935
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,990
Who is this? ./ Chloe...

936
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,920
This is Buck. / Thanks

937
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,750
Thank God, you're alive.

938
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,510
Where is my father?

939
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,460
He is here.

940
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,310
Chloe, honey, are you okay?

941
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,470
Dad...

942
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:24,330
I think you've died

943
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,310
Are you okay?

944
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:31,820
Yes, yes... I think so.

945
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:37,620
Mother and Raymie, they both disappear

946
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:44,530
I, I told you about this.

947
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,300
Yes, and he also had to tell me.

948
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:50,080
I love you very much.

949
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:53,030
I love you more than anything in this world.

950
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:56,000
I, father. I also...

951
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:58,950
I'm so sorry, I lied to you this
day and I'm not there with you today.

952
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:02,540
I just want you to know how much I love you
.

953
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,690
No matter what happens.

954
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:07,470
Well, dad... Why
do you talk like this?

955
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,390
What happened? Where are you?

956
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:14,160
Well... we still are in the air. We
the way, but there is a problem.

957
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,000
All electrical path outages...

958
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:18,950
What?

959
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:21,830
And I do not have enough fuel.

960
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,740
Chloe...

961
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,760
Dad...

962
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,490
Chloe...

963
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,350
The passengers...

964
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,330
We are entering the New York area.

965
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:27,170
Good...

966
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,910
All its airport closed.

967
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,880
And I want you to keep on kuris you

968
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:39,660
Fasten your seat belt,
and try to remain calm

969
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,510
But I have to be honest...

970
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:46,190
This is a very serious situation.

971
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:51,080
We talked on the tower controllers, and we
try to alternate landing area

972
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:54,060
But very little fuel us

973
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:59,700
Please note well our flight crew.

974
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:02,590
And if you believe
with the power of prayer.

975
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,490
Perhaps now is the time

976
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:11,260
Do you want to pray with me?

977
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:14,160
Yes, of course. Course.

978
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,360
No nothing.

979
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,410
Still not getting the signal.

980
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,500
Keep on trying.

981
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:34,330
I'll do it.

982
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,210
Well, now you have to put it down.

983
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:39,200
Put?

984
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,090
Where? ./ Aquatic...

985
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,010
But you said...

986
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,810
I know...

987
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:48,640
I want to fly in the JFK long as I could, but
I can not fly there without there are landing pads

988
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,760
This all happens in all airports

989
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,430
By flying there, it is impossible

990
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:58,340
We flew 4,000 times

991
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,060
JFK tower is 257 Peacon we need airstrip immediately

992
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,810
Continue to try

993
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:51,060
Well everything,
I need you to pay attention because we enter the emergency procedures.

994
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:52,180
I need you guys

995
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,410
Listen to instructions from the flight crew

996
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:10,380
JFK tower is Peacon 257, we need
emergency landing, now.

997
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:16,170
JFK tower. JFK tower is Peacon 257,
I need emergency landing now.

998
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:31,300
Come on...

999
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,680
right.

1000
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,560
Buck, can you hear me?

1001
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,490
Chloe

1002
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,480
Biarakan I speak in speakers

1003
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,290
I think I found a place where you can land
.

1004
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:04,070
In the highlands in the west, there is a large
lane and I was cleaning the track.

1005
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:06,920
Nothing is guiding us, we
can not land in the dark.

1006
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:10,820
Hey, check your phone and open the application compass...

1007
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,580
Well, wait a minute.

1008
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,460
Well, I've got it.

1009
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:20,530
Well, see the below screen is no sequence of numbers.
I need you to read it to me.

1010
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:28,940
North West... 40.66.34 73.78.32

1011
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:29,970
I got

1012
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,870
Chloe, how long
path that we have a foundation?

1013
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:32,990
Uh... There is about half a mile, father.

1014
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:33,920
And there's more...

1015
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,740
How much longer? I need at least 1 mile.

1016
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,650
Well, wait a minute.

1017
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:07,330
Chloe... Chloe, what are you still there?

1018
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,120
Around 17:10

1019
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,070
18...

1020
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:18,020
Buck... Buck, can you hear me?

1021
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:20,780
Hello?

1022
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,530
Come

1023
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,190
You've got to be kidding on me

1024
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,050
Come on.

1025
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:51,500
We need a vision or something,
so we can know when the landing would begin

1026
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:07,000
you want me to sit here shortly
? ./ Yes... Yes...

1027
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:11,680
Do not stop praying, and
all will be fine.

1028
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:25,280
We're running out of fuel.

1029
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,140
What?

1030
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:28,160
Not.

1031
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:31,060
This can still be used for landing
at least we should try to land

1032
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:36,590
Or we will hit the ground quickly.
Is not nothing we can slow down, just brakes alone.

1033
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:39,450
I need you to seek the best for us

1034
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,190
Father...

1035
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,180
Chloe...

1036
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:49,140
Chloe...

1037
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:53,860
About 9/10 mi. This is the longest track
I can try.

1038
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,810
I mean 9/10 is enough?

1039
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:00,580
But you need something
sign up so I could see the runway being

1040
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:03,460
right.
I play my car lights, what do you see?

1041
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,330
No, we were too far away for that, we need
bigger and brighter as a beacon

1042
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:10,350
We ran out of time, I
have to land now.

1043
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,250
Chloe...

1044
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:21,890
I just need my lighter...

1045
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,510
What we are going through there?

1046
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:32,220
If no, I do not want him to think it was a mistake
he

1047
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:56,500
This is it, we're going to land.

1048
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,400
Did you see something?

1049
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:03,040
No.... / Keep looking,
about 3 miles.

1050
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:14,660
We only have one chance,
we must know when to start

1051
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:16,500
Still nothing whatever

1052
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,470
Come on darling

1053
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,100
There!

1054
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:12,290
Try opening wheels for landing.

1055
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,340
Dad, you're going to hit me.

1056
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,170
Oh...

1057
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,900
We're home

1058
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:36,630
All right, get out of the plane, now.
Come on, hurry.

1059
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,260
We should fast. Let

1060
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,380
Come...

1061
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:15,210
You can get down, I beg
away from the path, / Come away

1062
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,500
Hey, hey

1063
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,480
Hey!

1064
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:56,470
Buck.... / Chloe.

1065
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:59,290
Thank you.

1066
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,970
You've done an incredible job.

1067
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:09,890
You also

1068
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:11,760
Patty!

1069
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,550
I'm sorry.

1070
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:18,570
I know.

1071
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,160
Dad...

1072
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,890
I should be there with you.

1073
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,650
With the mother, and Remy.
I'm not supposed to leave you.

1074
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,650
I'm quite happy you okay

1075
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:44,410
