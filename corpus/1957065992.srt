They're dangerous.

352

Take some for me.

353
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,630
Why the long face, fella?

354
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,267
My best friend Stewart
can't hang out with me.

355
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,902
He's got gonorrhea.

356
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,905
Gonorrhea comes from Italy,
I think.

357
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,807
Let's call next door
to the pizzeria

358
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,775

to come over.

359
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,746
( speaking Italian )

360
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,917
Luigi, you're an &quot;I-talian.&quot;
Tell us what gonorrhea is.

361
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,921
Gonorrhea.
Now that's a spicy discharge.

362
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:24,522
Now,
that's interesting.

363
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,658
Tell us some more, Luigi.

364
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:31,529
Oh it'll turn
your sausage into a hot pepper.

365
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:34,265

- And it'll kill you.

- Hey, Satan!
- Yeah dude.

391

Would you consider
yourself

man, Satan?

393
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,910
Well now, I'll tell you,
this girl's

a big, fat horse dong

396

Well, Satan.

Just one.

416
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,620
You work for a major
government organization,

417

why the fuck
can't they fix your face?

418

- Midget Ninjas.
- Sweet corn-fed Jesus.

424
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:34,112
Boy, Jesus was a black man,
Jesus has a Jheri curl.

Sir, we have
a big problem.

441
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,882
So, I see the
government sent

million dollar man.

443
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,921
Best men are for weddings,
I'm here for the funeral.

444
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,823
Well, I hope
you like a closed casket,

445
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:55,627
cause I'm gonna mess
you up big time.

446
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,531
Correction,
small time.

452
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:02,260
( growling )

453
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,675
How many times
have you tried losing weight?

454
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,745
Only to find that you're
not losing any weight?

455
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,914
Well, now there's
a new way.

456
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,318
A final way,
to get off those extra pounds.

It couldn't
be any easier.

462
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,172
Time to ask
the tough question, Satan.

463
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,274
If Jesus was here
in the room right now,

464
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:53,144
what'd you say?

465
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,746
Ah, me and Jesus,
we don't have beef.

466
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,982
It's just that he's
a faggot

467
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:00,151
and I can kick his ass.

468
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:01,819

where do you summer?

470
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,957
When I'm not busy
being Satan, what?

Your body is ruined.

507

I haven't actually
started yet.

508
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:53,030
My God.
Your cholesterol
is through the roof

509
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:57,168
and you have no liver.
Literally, it's gone.

510
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,004
And you're having a heart
attack right now.

This happens all the time.

512

It's not gonna happen today.

513
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,011
Well, nobody dies
on my shift, big buddy.

514
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:09,914
The doctor
and I decided that

515
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:11,849
&quot;Extrasize Me&quot; might not be
the best documentary

516
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:13,951
for me right now.
So I've changed the game plan.

517
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:15,852
I've decided to buy
and consume as much cocaine

518
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,855
as I possibly
can in the next thirty days.

519
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:19,857
And if my drug dealer
asks me if I want to eight ball,

520
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,327
I have to upgrade.
This is &quot;Eight Ball Me.&quot;

521
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:29,033
So you want some fucking
booger sugar, huh?

522
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,535
How much do you want
to get, dog?

523
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,271
- I'll take a gram.
- That's tight, that's tight.

524
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,273
You sure you
just don't want a eight ball?

525
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:43,247
- All right.
- Step up fool, let's roll.

526
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,216
( snorting )

527
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:52,990
Shit, you're having
a fucking heart attack!

528
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:55,226
What the fuck?
What the fuck,

529
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,361
get the fuck out
of my fucking house, dude.

530
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:59,831
Oh, fuck.

531
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,441
No, but I asked this one,
he knows how to pistol whip

532
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,577
a man and not
leave no marks.

533
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,277
He's a professional.

534
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:15,478
<i> Ay cabron!</i>
A professional,<i> sí.</i>

535
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:18,115
I got written up
so many times before

536
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:19,951
I learned this technique.

537
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,586
- ( speaking Spanish )
- Hold on a minute.

538
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,221
Get your<i> pistola</i> and you
hold it right here like this.

539
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,255
- Show the camera.
- Like this, you hold it...

540
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:26,390
( speaking Spanish )

541
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,859
You say,<i>
 Toma, guey!</i>

542
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,994
<i> Toma, guey!
 Otra vez.</i>

543
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:31,262
<i> Toma, guey!</i>

544
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:33,531
See no bruise.
I used to pistol whip

545
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:37,034
- like this or like that.
- Or like this.

546
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,269
<i> Toma, guey!</i>

547
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:40,303
No, that's bad.
You get written up.

548
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,006
( speaking Spanish )

549
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,442
You taught me that,<i>
 mi amigo,</i> my partner.

550
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,509
<i> Cabron.</i>

551
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,078
Learned it as a child.

552
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,113
-( speaking Spanish )
- What's that noise?

553
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:51,182
- Let's put on the light switch.
- ( shouting )

554
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:52,550
- Turn on the lights.
- Fuck you, beaners!

555
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,352
Ah, it looks like
we have trouble.

556
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,154
Yeah, sweet dude!

557
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,157
( speaking Spanish )

558
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:07,164
Put your hands out
where we can see them.

559
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,934
( speaking Spanish )

560
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,335
- What?
- ( speaking Spanish )

561
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,570
Which one of you
had the weed,

562
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:14,572
Abercrombie,
or bitch, cabron?

563
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:18,009
- We ain't got no weed mad.
- Who's got the weed?

564
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,078
Who's got the weed?
Come here.

565
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:23,447
Damn it,
we don't have any weed, man.

566
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,416
We just came for some titties,
we just came for some titties.

567
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,351
<i> Mira.</i>
See,<i> guey.</i>

568
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:28,619
( groans )

569
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:30,121
<i> ( shouting in Spanish )</i>

570
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,122
<i> Toma, toma!</i>

571
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,624
This is for Salma Hayek!

572
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:38,696
This is for everybody.
Who's next?

573
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,465
I'm Jeffery Sutton,
masturbation trainer.

574
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:43,067
Being in touch
with your body

575
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,302
and masturbating
are not bad.

576
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,505
It's your body,
take charge.

577
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,608
Think about how good
you feel while masturbating.

578
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:53,244
Your body needs love.
Don't be afraid
to give it to it.

579
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:56,447
It took me years,
living in my parents' basement

580
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,616
to perfect the techniques
I'm bringing to you.

581
00:31:58,649 --> 00:31:59,684
Techniques such as:

582
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,219
Wind cooling.

583
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,687
The process
of using a fan

584
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,189
to cool your hand down
to a temperature your body

585
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:08,658
will not recognize
as it's own.

586
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:12,029
Or sitting on your hand
until it falls asleep.

587
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:14,599
And then you
can take advantage of it.

588
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,172
Announcer:<i>
 Send check or money order to:</i>

589
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,572
<i>Jeffery Sutton.</i>

590
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:23,574
<i>Care of Jeffery Sutton's
parent's house.</i>

591
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,242
<i>Masturbation not legal</i>

592
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,610
<i>in Pennsylvania, Utah,

593

<i>Tennessee
and some parts of Texas.</i>

594
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,381
Announcer:<i>
 And next up,</i>

595
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:33,351
<i> it's Lexis from Texas
 with the strongest neck</i>

596
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,519
<i> in the west.
 If you know what I mean.</i>

597
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,288
As a professional dancer,

598
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,322
I know the importance
of staying in shape.

599
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,459
And between
my stage performance,

600
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,396
my drug addictions,
and my regular visits
to the STD clinic,

601
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:48,366
I don't have
a lot of time for exercise.

602
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,101
Neckercise
was engineered by a team

603
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,537
of world renowned
scientists.

604
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,073
They designed
what four out of five
titty dancers agree,

605
00:32:57,107 --> 00:33:01,012
is the perfect
balance of strength
and endurance.

606
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,749
Man:<i>
 Oh, yeah!</i>

607
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:08,418
Time is money,
and client satisfaction
is everything.

608
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:11,589
That's why
I choose Neckercise.

609
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:27,204
It's hotter than
a motherfucker, shit.

610
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,106
Man, what's taking
them so long.

611
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:32,476
Damn, I'm tired
of this shit.

612
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,113
- Yup.
- Ah, this. Here they come.

613
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,514
You said &quot;boat,&quot;

614
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,618
not three hundred
fucking boats, shit dick.

615
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,586
Are you guys sure
you're not cops?

616
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,755
- Do we look like cops?
- You look like my dick.

617
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,425
You got the money?

618
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,559
- Yeah, you got the yeah?
- Yeah I got the yeah.

619
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,628
- You got the money?
- Yeah.

620
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,163
Hey shut the fuck up
about the money and the yeah.

621
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,631
Thank you,
where is the money?

622
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,668
- Close.
- How close?

623
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,570
In my pocket.

624
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:05,176
Sweet. Alright,
let's do this shit.

625
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:10,147
Let me test
this shit.

626
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,415
Come on, man.

627
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,549
You didn't
even put your face in it.

628
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,851
You sure you're
not a cop?

629
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,119
- Come on, man.
- Man, what the fuck?

630
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,520
You didn't even take it.

631
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:18,388
Come on stick
that big ass head in there.

632
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,623
Oh, yeah!

633
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:20,757
Man, I didn't say
face fuck it.

634
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,560
Would a cop do that? Yeah.

635
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,428
All right,
that's the real shit there.

636
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,364
Now give me the money
give me the money, pubic hair.

637
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:30,167
Pull that shit out.
You want some more
of this, big head?

638
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,534
Here you go, buddy.

639
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:33,838
What the fuck is that?
Miami Mice, suckers.

640
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,807
Oh shit!

641
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,642
Let's get these
motherfuckers.

642
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:40,845
Hell yeah!

643
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,181
What the hell?
Come back.

644
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,417
Bring your ass back here.

645
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:53,290
Trade me your board
for this gun, dude.

646
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:54,757
Thanks.

647
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,627
( laughs, grunts )

648
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,364
Fuckers, stay down.

649
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:03,134
Give me the board.
I'll shoot you, fucker.

650
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,136
You're gonna have to catch me,
motherfucker,

651
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,305
I'm a be
a hard ass prisoner.

652
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:09,740
Come on, brother.

653
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,542
Can't you give
a brother a break?

654
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:13,611
Yeah, I'm gonna give
you a break, all right.

655
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,886
I'll fucking shoot
you in the back, fucker.

656
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,288
Stop.

657
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:25,723
Fuck you.

658
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,227
( shouting )

659
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,265
Is there
a problem, officer?

660
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,533
Not anymore,
motherfucker.

661
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,350
Did that hurt?

662
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,753
( shouts )

663
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,621
You fucking shot me, dick.

664
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:59,323
( yelling )

665
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:06,629
You know,
Cathy recently sat down

666
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:08,799
with Jesus
and openly discussed
his being spotted

667
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,935
at numerous Hollywood
hot spots.

668
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,870
His ban from all state
lotteries and casinos.

669
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:14,872
And living
with his father

670
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,807
for so many years.

671
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,908
I lived with my dad

672
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,343
for about three
thousand years.

673
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:20,811
That was a long time.

674
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:22,680
I couldn't get any privacy.

675
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,915
Well, Jesus,
I must say I like
your new apartment.

676
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:27,551
If you want,
you can spend
the night here.

677
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:28,953
And um.
Well, I don't think

678
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,589
there's room
with all the pizza boxes.

679
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,390
Well, let's get
to some questions.

680
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:35,759
I've heard a rumor.

681
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,294
Can't do anymore lottery.

682
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:40,231
I fixed the winner,
whatever, the roll.

683
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,232
- Jesus magic.
- Yeah.

684
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,901
- And you'd win?
- A lot.

685
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,436
I'm banned
from playing anywhere

686
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,471
in the United States now.
To play lottery,

687
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,241
I have to go
to other countries like Africa.

688
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,909
They probably
don't give you much.

689
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:55,846
But the men
there are gorgeous,
and they are hung.

690
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:59,250
That's what I've heard.
Where did I hear that?

691
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,683
Where did I--

692
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,654
- Colin Farrell.

00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,491
a lot of people
are dying to know.

695
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:08,625

a little naughty.

699
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,500
Well I guess
I asked the question, didn't I.

700
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:19,403
You did, I hope

Don't get excited

A gangbanger's funeral
here in East Los Angeles.

756
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:47,450
Little Sleepy
was killed recently,

757

this funeral for him.

758

His homies

Why did he die?
Senseless, senseless act.

765
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:07,604
Maybe because
he spray painted a wall.

766
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:09,840
A wall on my house.

767
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,676
Maybe 'cause
he jacked a car. My car.

768
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,711
Maybe he took off
the rear side view mirrors

769
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:16,914
of my car
and that's why
he deserved to die.

770
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,849
That's right, pussy,
you deserved to die.

771
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:20,217
You ain't all that,

00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,619

what were you like
when you were a kid.

779
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,165
Did you smoke cigarettes,
hang out with your buddies?

780
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,968
Childhood
really began for me

781
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,238
when I first took
a bubble bath with my uncle.

782
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,739
Well, you gotta

Virgin Mary.

785
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,880
You think it's true
that she was a virgin?

786
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:52,683
I'm-- I'm sorry
this interview is over.

Ma'am, whatever you are.

his tell all book.

798
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:18,609
And talks about his ongoing feud
with the Dalai Lama.

799
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,844
( chuckles )
That sounds amazing, Cathy.

800
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,846
Well, we had to release
Jimmy Winks and Stingray

801
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,517
because you two used
excessive force on 'em.

802

1202
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:53,375
Ah shit,
look at those faggots.

1203
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:55,243
Man, I hate these
fucking faggots.

1204
01:01:55,277 --> 01:01:57,313
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this.

1205
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,281
Together:
Hey!

1206
01:01:59,314 --> 01:02:01,350
What do you guys want,
the regular?

1207
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:04,252
Only if that comes with
an extra large burrito,<i> hombre.</i>

1208
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:06,389
You want the regular or not?

1209
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,193
All right, this deal's
gonna go down,

1210
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:13,496
but I don't want
none of that gay shit,
do you understand?

1211
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,031
( scoffs )

1212
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,035
( squeaking, pop )

1213
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:21,871
( grunts )

1214
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,340
All:
Hey, hey.

1215
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:32,248
Any of you<i> vatos locos </i>
want to cleanse with a popper?

1216
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,317
It's mad relaxation
for your butt muscles.

1217
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,486
I'll take a hit.

1218
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,955
Ooh, Chongo.

1219
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,028
Inmate's voice:<i>
 It seemed Charlotte
 had made a breakthrough</i>

1220
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:49,198
with big Chongo in the back
of the laundry room that day.

1221
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:54,370
Ready for some Chongo love?

1222
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,437
( Charlotte
imitates club music )

1223
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:57,907
Chongo love?

1224
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,108
<i> Eh, homes.</i>

1225
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:02,111
I didn't Chongo
was a pipe monster.

1226
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:05,981
- He is now.
- I need some dick.

1227
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,416
<i> I tried everything
 I could think of</i>

1228
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:09,985
<i> to get taken advantage of
 that summer.</i>

1229
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:13,389
Oops,
I just dropped a soap.

1230
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:18,027
I'm bending over
to pick it up right now.

1231
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,797
( rock music playing )

1232
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:31,974
I'm Steve-O,
and I'm about to pull
a double kick flip

1233
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:33,843
on a coffee table.

1234
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,344
'Cause thrill
loves skateboarding,

1235
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:37,079
I love skateboarding.

1236
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:40,049
Fuck me.

1237
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:48,991
Yeah!

1238
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:52,060
Hey, I'm drunk,
but don't worry.

1239
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:53,596
Let's leave the skateboarding
to the professionals.

1240
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,331
Ladies and gentlemen,

1241
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,400
the greatest professional
skateboarder ever to live!

1242
01:03:59,234 --> 01:04:03,305
I'm Ryan Simonetti
and this is &quot;Calling the Cops.&quot;

1243
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:04,507
( shouts )

1244
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:13,182
Oh, yeah!

1245
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:19,222
( yelling )

1246
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:25,160
Ah! Fuck you!

1247
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:26,662
( shouting )

1248
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:28,464
Fuck that table!

1249
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:58,928
Announcer:<i>
 This is an FNN special report.</i>

1250
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:02,997
Hello, a camper,
who was actually camping

1251
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:05,701
<i> brought us this next
 doozy of a story</i>

1252
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:07,403
<i> that I found
 so compelling,</i>

1253
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,005
I had to go down
and investigate it further.

1254
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,440
All by myself.

1255
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:13,709
In the swamps of Florida,

1256
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:15,644
we found
what looked like an ogre.

1257
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:16,645
A real live ogre.

1258
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,513
Or what appeared to be

1259
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,150
<i> an ogre that looked like
 another ogre that's famous.</i>

1260
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,954
<i> We followed him,
 for several days.</i>

1261
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,622
<i> Through the swamps.</i>

1262
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:29,725
This is the interview,
raw and uncut.

1263
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:34,129
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Cut! Cut!

1264
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,038
Sadly, our interview ended,
and I had to leave,

1265
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:46,107
but we'll fondly remember
our little friend in the swamp.

1266
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:48,244
<i> I know I will.</i>

1267
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:54,583
That was-- that was
an amazing interview.

1268
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:00,089
I'm Jeffery Sutton,
masturbation trainer.

1269
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,024
You may know me
from my popular line

1270
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:03,993
of training tapes available
only on the internet,

1271
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,495
television, and through
some gentlemen's magazines.

1272
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:07,696
Well, now there's a new way

1273
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:09,497
to learn my time-tested
techniques.

1274
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:12,201
Jeffery Sutton's
masturbation training camp.

1275
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:15,738
That's right.
Uh-huh!

1276
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:18,374
I'll run you through
a rigorous course

1277
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,242
that will not only
train your body,

1278
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:23,212
but most importantly,
your precious hands.

1279
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,457
Act now,
and the first 100 callers

1280
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,625
will receive this handsome
Jeffery Sutton t-shirt.

1281
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:45,234
Well, kids, we have a very
special treat for you.

1282
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,403
Today,
a famous scientist

1283
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,071
is gonna
come into the classroom

1284
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:54,042
and talk to us
about alligators.

1285
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,444
Got you.

1286
01:06:55,477 --> 01:06:57,413
Nobody here's afraid
of alligators, are they?

1287
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:00,214
You are?

1288
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,084
Well, I'm not afraid
of alligators.

1289
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:04,386
If I'm not afraid,
you don't have to be afraid.

1290
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:06,821
You just have to be brave.

1291
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:11,493
So, not to worry, we're just
gonna see some photographs.

1292
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,596
( roaring,
children screaming )

1293
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:23,372
But you said
you were gonna talk to it...

1294
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:26,141
Hands on
is the best way to learn.

1295
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:27,676
What about safety?

1296
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,444
Safety's not an issue.
I have it all under control.

1297
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,713
<i> ( roars )</i>

1298
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:34,483
All right, kids, we're gonna
have a little demonstration,

1299
01:07:34,516 --> 01:07:35,818
and Manny has assured me

1300
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:39,321
that everything
is perfectly safe.

1301
01:07:39,354 --> 01:07:41,390
This is a handfeed.

1302
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:46,495
( screaming )

1303
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:02,811
Don't freak out.
Calm down.

1304
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:05,581
You have a considerable
flesh wound.

1305
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:10,486
( screaming continues )

1306
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:15,189
Today we've learned
that the alligator
is very impressive.

1307
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:17,859
When I launch
this missile at the moon,

1308
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:22,598
I'll prove to the world
that I'm king of the madmen.

1309
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,902
Sir, that's absolutely
ridiculous.

1310
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:31,373
Why would you want to launch
the missile at the moon?

1311
01:08:31,406 --> 01:08:33,274
Einstein,
you're an idiot.

1312
01:08:33,308 --> 01:08:34,776
It's the middle
of the day.

1313
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:37,446
The moon
won't be out for hours.

1314
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,414
It's a slow missile,
you ignorant moron.

1315
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:41,617
Just launch it.

1316
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:15,651
-<i> Thirty seconds to launch. </i>
- Oh, man.

1317
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:19,254
- XXXL, you son of a bitch.
- I got you, Lankin.

1318
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:21,723
You're own your own, puppy.

1319
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:26,762
<i> Fifteen seconds to launch.</i>

1320
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,531
Hey, hey, hey,
what the hell do you want?

1321
01:09:29,564 --> 01:09:31,900
Can't you see
I'm in the middle
of something, motherfucker?

1322
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:33,902
I don't know what to do.
I'm in a jam.

1323
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,538
I've got fifteen seconds
to stop this missile
from being launched.

1324
01:09:36,571 --> 01:09:38,407
I need a pass key
to get into their system.

1325
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:41,910
Motherfucker,
use the force.

1326
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:44,780
What is that, magic?

1327
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,281
No, motherfucker.

1328
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:48,283
Force something
into the console.

1329
01:09:48,316 --> 01:09:50,285
What are you,
stupid, Fat Joe?

1330
01:09:50,318 --> 01:09:52,621
What's wrong,
is you dirty?

1331
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:54,856
Jeez.
Go on and handle this, man.

1332
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:56,258
I gotta finish
what I'm doing.

1333
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:57,626
God damn it.

1334
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,880
Shit!

1335
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:22,617
The suit! The suit!
The suit!

1336
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,888
Damn, you're squashing me.
You're squashing me.

1337
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:30,392
Yeah, dude,
it's time, isn't it?

1338
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:32,494
Time for you to admit
that your dick

1339
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:33,962
is so fucked up
with herpes

1340
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:36,365
that you won't even
show it to your own wife.

1341
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,899
Let alone
cheat on her with it.

1342
01:10:37,932 --> 01:10:40,469
You're not gonna go
anywhere near a doctor's office,

1343
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:41,703
because they
might tell you

1344
01:10:41,736 --> 01:10:44,573
how fucked up
your dick really is.

1345
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:46,008
Chill out, dude.
It's mellow.

1346
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,478
I got the Extendo-Dong-brand
penis concealer.

1347
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:51,046
And enhancer.

1348
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,382
Come in for a fitting,

1349
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,484
<i> and enjoy your dick
 the way it used to look.</i>

1350
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:59,454
<i>Except longer, firmer,
and girthier.</i>

1351
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:02,658
Fuck your way back to the top
of your relationship

1352
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,027
and all the side bitches.

1353
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,697
Sure, you gave your wife
and a few bitches herpes.

1354
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:12,401
But now you can give back.
Extendo Dong.

1355
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,336
Fuck 'em all.

1356
01:11:18,673 --> 01:11:20,309
( duck squeaks )

1357
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:27,849
I can smell
the great outdoors
and the open range.

1358
01:11:27,882 --> 01:11:29,483
It's great here.

1359
01:11:29,517 --> 01:11:30,818
But there's been
some development.

1360
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,321
Hey, stranger.

1361
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,556
Better watch for Indians
and rattle snakes.

1362
01:11:34,589 --> 01:11:36,758
Shut up,
you old coot.

1363
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:38,760
We know you gotta
save your money.

1364
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:41,096
Nobody knows that better
than a cowboy.

1365
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:43,799
That's why we
at the Black Angus
cattle restaurant

1366
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:47,502
are bringing you
the big beef burger sandwich.

1367
01:11:47,535 --> 01:11:50,105
Oh, yes,
it's raining beef.

1368
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:51,740
It's a fat-ass
woman burger.

1369
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:53,875
And it's burger-licious.

1370
01:11:53,908 --> 01:11:57,313
- Oh, your beef is so big.

What do they call
a taco in France?

1372
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:04,885
Well, a taco
is just a taco,

1373
01:12:04,919 --> 01:12:06,688
but they call it
&quot;le taco.&quot;

1374
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:08,389
- Le taco?
- Le taco.

1375
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:11,626
Le taco,
le taco. Le taco.

01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:14,129

Oh, I'm gonna
handcuff you inside, chica.

- I can watch, no?
- Oh, shit! She's a man.

1389
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:53,934
She's a man!
She has a sausage,

1390
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:56,505

1391
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,072
Kick her out.
Should I kick her out?

1392
01:12:58,106 --> 01:13:01,876
Uh, she's kinda cute.

1393
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,577
Okay.

When my brother
first started

1397
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:15,657
partying with children
for a living,

<i> we were all
 very proud of him.</i>

1399
01:13:17,592 --> 01:13:19,861
But then, it was more
about the party

1400
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:20,996
and less about
the children.

1401
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,697
Kids are ready.
They're outside.

1402
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,901
Ah. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

1403

We've had cameras
following him around,

to intervene, dude.

I mean,
I'll level with you.

1412

that fucking clown?

What the fuck are you doing?
That's my wife!

Oh, you don't you even think
about cock-blocking me!

1425

I just have a fucking blast.

Plus I act as my own agent,

1432

Ah, much better.

I'm back, kids.

I'll tell ya,
back when I was
in clown college,

1438
01:15:19,914 --> 01:15:23,018
I was at the top
of my class.

What kind of twisted
party clown are you?

I'm not paying for you.
Get out of my house.

My brother thinks he's going
to another kids' party.

1453
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:27,715
But it's actually
an intervention.

1454
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,050
He probably
won't know the difference,

1455
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:32,253
but it's time to stop,
Steve-O.

1456

Enough is enough, dude.

1457
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:37,291
And hopefully this
is the last party
you'll ever go to.

1458
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:39,260
Yeah, dude.

1459
01:16:42,897 --> 01:16:47,802

Thank you.

I'd like to thank you all
for being here.

1461
01:16:49,737 --> 01:16:52,040
It's nice to see that
Steve-O's got

1462
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:55,310
such supportive
friends and family members.

1463
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:59,014
I'd say Steve-O
is one lucky clown.

Now, he thinks
he's coming here

1465

for a birthday party.

1466
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:06,855
When he gets here, he might
be in destructive mode,

1467
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:09,924
so nobody do anything
to agitate him.

1468
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:13,028
Hmm? Remind him
that we're here to help him.
