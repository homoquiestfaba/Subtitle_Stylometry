1
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:23,153
How does it kill someone feel?

2
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:28,450
Like my father always said:

3
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:32,662
"It is better to become a 12-judge
than six range. "

4
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:37,333
What your father did?
-You know it well.

5
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,669
He was a hero.

6
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:45,465
The vast majority of New Orleans
is under water.

7
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:49,469
Tens thousandth of homes and businesses
have been destroyed.

8
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:54,474
This is our country's history
the worst natural disasters.

9
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:59,603
The Mayor Nagin has ordered
almost all the 1 500 police officers --

10
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:06,652
Iopettamaan rescue
and to go to prevent theft.

11
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,322
Oh, hell, is it Kenny?
-On.

12
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:02,620
What do your partner here did?
-We made a distinction.

13
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:07,541
I was 9 district.
People were stuck in here.

14
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:11,920
I did not receive half off
until the water rose.

15
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,923
Help me.

16
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:21,011
Dead työparisi,
Kenny Cowlings ...

17
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:26,058
What about her?
What do you want to know?

18
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:31,563
You tell me.
-Did he bribe?

19
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:39,403
If Kenny had taken bribes,
I would have killed him.

20
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,414
There have been flooded,
I need help.

21
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:14,269
All the bandits shot at.
Go out of business confidence.

22
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:18,939
You moron.
You can not even bear telkkaria.

23
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,443
Let's go to hell.

24
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:28,615
What the hell are you doing?
-Come down from there!

25
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:31,659
I do my job.
-Come on down.

26
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:36,247
Siivoamme your sotkut.
-We 're in this together.

27
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:39,500
Come on down!
-Go out of himself. I do my work.

28
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,878
Come down now!
-I. Take care of your own work.

29
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:46,673
You shot a man for no reason.
-He deserved it.

30
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:50,677
Stan Johnson, 5 circuit.
-Are you a cop?

31
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:54,138
I will handle this.
Ammutko are you cops?

32
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:56,891
Drop your weapon.
Calculate it!

33
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:09,945
Andy Devereaux.
-Hi. Stan Johnson.

34
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:13,448
Where is your partner?
-He left when the water rose.

35
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:19,370
I stayed here. Where are you from?
-Chicago. I came here only.

36
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:22,539
Lucky boy.
-Did I not?

37
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:27,377
He shot the man accused.
-New Orleans atmosphere is gone.

38
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:46,853
... Katrina hit the city
and suburban areas.

39
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:51,024
New Orleans residents
prayed for mercy.

40
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:56,279
... the victim is increasing.
Whole neighborhoods are gone.

41
00:04:56,487 --> 00:05:02,201
Residents now get to know
that they might not be able to return.

42
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,330
... the number of dead
can rise to thousands.

43
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:12,252
The conditions get worse still
two dam fell.

44
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,756
Approximately 80% of the city
is now under water.

45
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:20,801
We are the storm,
which many of us are afraid.

46
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,470
I do not want to be alarmist --

47
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:27,683
but people need to realize
that the situation is serious.

48
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,894
Hence the dramatic instruction.

49
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:37,108
Everyone must now leave
New Orleans.

50
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:42,529
Rekkalasteittain water, ice,
food, medicines and tents ...

51
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:49,369
More than 1 700 cars will be ready
to bring supplies across.

52
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:53,790
Coast Guard has worked with
great two days --

53
00:05:53,998 --> 00:06:00,296
and it has saved
more than 1, 000 vulnerable people.

54
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:06,176
The aim now is to find a space
tens of thousands homeless --

55
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:11,806
and to save the people katoilta
desert Super Domen area.

56
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:17,061
Reconstruction takes a long time.
It will take many years.

57
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,898
Violent looting
have increased.

58
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:25,485
Many movements have been stolen
all the weapons.

59
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:29,489
Armed gangs
dominate the streets.

60
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,250
Half a year later in.

61
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,476
How you doing?
- What do you do?

62
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:03,729
Go inside only.

63
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:09,901
How you doing?
-What do you do? The new gold teeth?

64
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,786
Hello. Do you have something for me?

65
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,416
Hello, darling.

66
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:36,300
Latin Kings!

67
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,019
Hell, Chamarro!

68
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:46,448
Was it here?
-No.

69
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:50,285
You now have a new pair.
You trust him?

70
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,372
True on earth.

71
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:06,300
Look at these.
Swarm wannabe-koviksia.

72
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,719
Have been here all day.

73
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,353

What am I doing?
-Hands behind the head.

78
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,309
I just want to chat to you.

79
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,853

Let go.
-Put him in irons.

This is my park.
I make you a 9-mm-sterilization.

91

Do not do it.

92
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:20,923
Shoot at him, Stan.
-Not good enough. He is not a threat to us.

93
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:24,802
He wanted to shoot kytän.
Will save lives by shooting him.

94
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,514
I will shoot him.
-Do not shoot! I know important stuff.

95
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:34,394
You do not know shit.

What does he look like?
-Black dude with a pisamat.

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,449
It has a handsome green Caprice,
which have large rims.

Why I am interested
dealer for the youths, which has a fine track?

101
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:00,543
That guy is a drug agency of men.

Are you okay?
-I.

106
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:30,320
We had luck.
-But Downey Littlellä not.

107
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,409
When his partner
were found dead --

108
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:42,956
He requested the transfer for you,
so that you can start to his paired.

109
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:46,960
Yes. Palkkakin was better.

110
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,005
I have a wife and three children.

111
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:54,717
Please tell me the family.
-You have to evaluate my family.

112
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:59,055
This will be your data.
-I do not tell my family.

113
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:04,017
Then we talk about a couple of your privacy.
-What about him?

114
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:09,022
He always goes to the door first.

115
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:12,692
He has received a dealer for the youths in jail
and killed the pair.

116
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,320
Does it
opinion of him?

117
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:23,410
Our group, except
Police here are a joke.

118
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,121
The situation is getting worse
before healing.

119
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,083
Gangs have become here in the whole country.

120
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:37,965
My and Andy's like, guys
keep your world up.

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,558
Hell, that is boring.
Looking for something vibrant.

00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:52,937
Huvittaako go?
-No.

123
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,649
You have to learn to love this.

124
00:13:56,858 --> 00:14:00,402
Come on, Barney.
Do not just sit on the egg in hand.

125
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:04,198
What the hell is that?
-That is a Santa Claus.

126
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:08,452
That is a ghost.
I have not given permission to drive here.

127
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,413
Without the lights yet.

128
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:18,711
Want to play?
-He slows down.

129
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,595
Would you like to give me a reason?

130
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,848
He wants to play.
-Let's go with.

131
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:36,227
Are you ready?
-Let 's go. Where did he go?

132
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:41,106
Keep eye on her, Barney.

133
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:46,361
In this way we go.
Do not lose him.

134
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,698
Right or left?
-Left.

135
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:53,660
Right here.
-Where the hell is he?

136
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:57,538
Maybe we should go.
Leave it to another night.

137
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:01,292
That bastard can not shave
the center of anything and everything.

138
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,044
There he is.

139
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,949
What do you have? At least not in
chickens and watermelons.

140
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:43,872
Ajatko to me, asshole?
-Don 't you know who you talking about?

141
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:48,001
I do not give a shit.
Lift the window and tell me to hell.

142
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,797
Shut up, pisamanaama.
-Steal Christmas cartwheel?

143
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:56,551
Will kill you in Satan now.
Hands-ratille!

144
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:09,563
Drug Police.
If you breathe, you're dead.

145
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:14,609
Watch her, Barney. -Hell.
I thought that we just pelleiltiin.

146
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,528
Go to hell!

147
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:21,365
I am the drug agency!
-Ah, so you?

148
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,998
Bribes that welcomes cop.

149
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,792
Yeah, but I am still alive.

150
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:37,213
You do not take bribes,
but now you're dead.

151
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,049
The die is cast.

152
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:46,013
What about confirmations?
-You are my actions.

153
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,433
What are you now did you, Barney?

154
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:55,104
You shot him on the head.
-Is he a drug agency?

155
00:16:55,313 --> 00:17:01,110
Quite a story. Well shot.
Lohduttaudutaan half & half play.

156
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,280
Half of his money,
his half their substances.

157
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:09,284
In this world, man is nothing
if he does not have the money.

158
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:13,329
I shot him on the head.
Well-shot.

159
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,708
We are fucked.
Do you know do it?

160
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,838
Make this statement.
I studied the car.

161
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:27,134
Teenkö message?
-Yes, do it, Barney.

162
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:33,765
What if we were seen.
-You are a ghost!

163
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:38,811
I, the number in this town!
Can you hear me, assholes?

164
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:47,652
Oh, hell, Barney!
This is a great evening.

165
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:54,117
Make a declaration, it already is.
-Tapatat me yet. The Devil's crazy.

166
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:59,080
Don 't you feel it?
This is the best part.

167
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,999
I know the whole ruumiissani.

168
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:21,016
How repairs are progressing?
-The roof is still a hole.

169
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:27,022
I can lend you the money.
-Me pärjätään, but thank you.

170
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:42,828
Andy? That contribution this ...
-Shut up. You did well.

171
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:57,300
Do not chasing siskoasi.
For further back.

172
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:01,845
The food is almost ready.
Do something.

173
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,556
Korjataanko roof this morning?

174
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:08,602
Hello? So.

175
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:13,523
After all, it is good.
-Who is it?

176
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:17,944
Wait a minute.
So. Okay.

177
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:26,285
Insurance agent said,
that the rain damage will be replaced.

178
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:31,039
Let go, bitch.
-Around here there is talk about!

179
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:35,835
Ask for forgiveness from him!
I do not want to hear that word anymore.

180
00:19:56,938 --> 00:20:00,733
The FBI. Where are the marksmen?
-There.

181
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:09,449
Vasquez? Ballentine?
-Yeah. Who are you?

182
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:12,660
Agent Brown, FBI.
Do you know what you did?

183
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:16,289
I have only done my job.

184
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:20,751
Your work?
I shot-dealer for the youths Ray Delacroix'n.

185
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,921
You shot the FBI agent.
-Was he in your men?

186
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:28,049
Had taught
that the police may shoot.

187
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:33,972
You looked badge?
-Yes. But he shot first.

188
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:39,643
HIGH Friendly.
What happened, Vasquez?

189
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:44,565
He attended kimppuumme. We showed
badges, but he fired anyway.

190
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:49,402
Why did he do so?
-Look him up.

191
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:52,072
The man was a complete lunatic.

192
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:58,953
Go to the station and make a report.
-He deserves a medal.

193
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:04,958
Cardiac pump blood pasi few minutes
before he was shot in the head.

194
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:11,840
The first body hit,
he raise the gun shoot.

195
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:16,427
They shot him on the head
self-defense. Well shot.

196
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:23,934
I believe that the husband executed a
her third shot.

197
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:29,064
Where is this job, was he?
-It was the FBI investigation.

198
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:36,362
Clean your pesänne.
My husband is decent.

199
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,700
Your department is legendary.

200
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:46,747
Suspected of being beaten, the drug is lost
before storage ...

201
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:50,208
Do you have proof?
-For more than imagine.

202
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:56,172
So this was the first
ampumavälikohtauksesi? -Yeah.

203
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,219
How does it feel?
Time-good.

204
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:08,975
It was clear to me soon,
that I have to shoot --

205
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:13,980
if I was going to perform my work,
and so was able to do so.

206
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:19,235
How does it kill someone feel?
-I made only a job.

207
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:24,073
It was a legitimate kill.
There are animals.

208
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:28,785
I will take care of the animals.

209
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,582
One calf Delacroix'sta spoke.
I would like to chat to him.

210
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:39,170
It is too late.
If you do not wish to be contacted psychic.

211
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:43,632
Did he say anything interesting?
-Said kusipääksi me.

212
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:48,845
Is that why you shot him?
-Here in the city departed eaten.

213
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,431
Departed eaten.

214
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:57,061
It was late and I was hungry.
I like dark meat.

215
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,313
Precisely.

216
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:03,400
He seemed a good meal,
so I shot him.

217
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:07,154
Oh hell kuustoista,
give a little food.

218
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:11,157
I kyttänä city,
Who the hell are you?

219
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:14,452
Rumors have, therefore, correct?

220
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:18,831
So you really eat the dead.

221
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,252
Really? I like
socks pins at the top --

222
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,005
and a dry ass spike fooled.

223
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:30,925
You do the job you are to me the information,
who lost your takianne.

224
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:36,055
Lincoln freed the slaves.
I will not help you.

225
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:39,892
You will help, since you submitted
Delacroix'n hell.

226
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:44,605
Hypätkää only.
The water is warm.

227
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:50,110
But bring floats.
-Floats with. Was there more?

228
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:56,949
Stan, can I give to you
lap dance at a later date.

229
00:23:57,158 --> 00:24:00,411
He should deal with.
-Provides turpaan?

230
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:06,416
This is bullshit.
I have not done anything. Let me.

231
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:11,463
Do not väännä hard.

232
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:19,303
Ferraro!
Office. Now.

233
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:25,392
Yes?

234
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:30,313
The FBI has perseessäni in such a way that seems
I would regard as the Hoover stringejä.

235
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:34,192
Are those guys imbalance?

236
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,992
The warning signals are there.

237
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:48,663
The normal feeling of guilt
after the shooting --

238
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:52,250
leaves me with the other
thinking less.

239
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:57,380
It can lead to
vainoharhoihin and isolation.

240
00:24:57,588 --> 00:25:03,594
All of this region blocks
are controlled by gangs.

241
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,847
The game is a lot of drug money.

242
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:10,600
Therefore, the police may be freer rein.

243
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,438
Receive or adopt?
-So it just is. Reply now.

244
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:19,025
Your report has not yet been completed.

245
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:26,698
I believe that one of my crew
has made a deal FBI.

246
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:30,994
Has he sung kytistä other?
They said so.

247
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:35,164
They want to know
what I would do the cause.

248
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:39,668
But if this is a traitor ...
-Do I have to explain this?

249
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:43,714
That is an internal investigation of thing.
-You must tell the facts.

250
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:47,384
I assessment of their mental condition.

251
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:53,181
Confidentiality
protect them.

252
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:56,976
You can break it
if they violate the rules.

253
00:25:57,185 --> 00:26:00,020
If you happen to hear something ...

254
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:04,233
If sattuisin find a traitor ...

255
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:09,404
Talk to me Ferraro.
You are in my job.

256
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,951
It is a good old 3NG through.

257
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:06,081
Chamarro and the Latin Kings
handled the job well

258
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,867
These were 3NG-gang.

259
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,914
Angered, they Do Ragsit?
Latin Kingsit?

260
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:55,293
Before the angle of five friends,
set up the gang.

261
00:27:55,501 --> 00:28:01,549
But this setting does not trade.
It is illegal in this country.

262
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:05,385
New Orleans drug trade
shares are now trading.

263
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:09,889
Perhaps this is, however,
only a local gang war.

264
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:14,269
Why the FBI is interested?
-It always is.

265
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:17,188
It will explore
the same stuff.

266
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:22,192
Look at this.

267
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:01,103
Relax a little.
They do not know why we are here.

268
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:06,108
Someone has taken ahneeksi.
-Do you want to start a gang war?

269
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:12,113
3NG are gone.
New Orleans is ready.

270
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:19,662
Willing to take.
-We have to decide who is the number.

271
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:29,045
Do you vote?

272
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:38,971
It was the number of votes in favor.

273
00:29:40,806 --> 00:29:42,683
Fuck you.

274
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:54,694
Check out this one.
-Come on.

275
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:58,614
I am the center of the city.
We departed eaten.

276
00:29:58,823 --> 00:30:02,201
Delacroix was a pile of shit,
kind turpaan beaten.

277
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,287
You are as Edgar Allen Poe.

278
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:08,415
Look at this.
-We 've got company.

279
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,043
Follow her, Barney.

280
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:18,341
Mahallesi country Satan.

281
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:24,805
Look at this.
Abrakadabra.

282
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:30,685
You live here in the corner.

283
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:34,605
You do not move,
and you do not say a word.

284
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,569
They extorted.
-It is now my turn.

285
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:47,784
What is your name?
-Tanya.

286
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:02,298
Jimmy Dean.
What do you do?

287
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,600
Where should we go?
-Directly ahead, hell.

288
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:17,228
Do not the big tele, slut.

289
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:24,193
There is only mulkunimijöitä.
-Bye. Wait a little.

290
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:29,281
What's Amman name is?
Open the door, Selina. Here is a police officer.

291
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:34,702
Need a search warrant.
-Tanya gave permission to.

292
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:37,705
Open the door.
-You have trouble.

293
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:41,792
But if I have to break the door,
viewfinder, you kamasi.

294
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:46,546
And then you put in irons.
Open this goddamn door.

295
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:52,093
Hands up!
Hands-up, Satan.

296
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:56,097
Do you want us to hit you?
Calculate the bag.

297
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,850
Calculate the bag.

298
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,353
Where were you going?
-I do anywhere.

299
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:07,357
You drag it.
I want to see your face.

300
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:11,694
What we have
-Look at this, Barney?

301
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:15,365
What do we have?
-This show will start from one.

302
00:32:15,573 --> 00:32:19,618
Now I get it, why you are in a hurry.
Are you a conditional?

303
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:23,122
Spread your legs.
-Do not be afraid.

304
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,584
You need to sit the rest of you.

305
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:31,796
For increased
cocaine possession as a result.

306
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:35,883
What things do you have?
-Do you know Ray Delacroix'n?

307
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,969
He is dead?

308
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:40,763
Who do you think you killed him?

309
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:45,475
He was the FBI agent.
-I did not know it.

310
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:50,146
And hell!
Now, starting with the station.

311
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:54,025
Come on.
-Now you want to talk?

312
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:59,989
Sit down, bitch!
What do you know? Tell me.

313
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:02,950
What news do you have?

314
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:08,121
Ray always hang out FEMA's camp.

315
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,956
FEMA?

316
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:13,167
After all, it is federal.
Fucks with me?

317
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:17,421
Did you this?
-I. Kai you believe me?

318
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,424
We do not want problems.

319
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:24,636
Relax.

320
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,892
Do not kiss the mouth, narkkarihuora.
I do a full search.

321
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:36,147
How long is it going?
Small-time. Make yourself a drink.

322
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:40,734
Partner may be a little hard.
-I like kovistelusta.

323
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:46,031
Oh, shit.

324
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:49,075
Not the mouth!

325
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:58,334
We do not want problems.

326
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,300
Kiillota badge?

327
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:09,094
Just like that.

328
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,388
Remove the handcuffs.

329
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:18,686
Fine Moment
huumepoliisimme history.

330
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:26,735
I studied his documents.
-Kenny is gone. Stop already.

331
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:31,448
No, but your father.
Or, because I am here I am.

332
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:36,702
I just wanted to know
Why live to the edge.

333
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,416
I am a good cop.
All you need to know.

334
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:47,045
I am concerned about safety.
-Are you worried about me?

335
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,382
It is nice.

336
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:55,845
100-meter radius of this
made crimes. We are looking for them.

337
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:59,974
And then what?
-We do not hesitate. We apply the law.

338
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,769
Shooting incidents do not think.
It is a reflex.

339
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:09,482
If pahis going to shoot STAN,
ampuisin him. And vice versa.

340
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:13,444
So trust the Parisians?
-Yes.

341
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:22,328
Trust your partner to contact you?
-He is safe in my parinani.

342
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:29,960
You have over there, the weapons displayed at night.
Against the closed door.

343
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,590
If you want to secure your partner,
wait for reinforcements.

344
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:40,761
Do not chasing legends.
-You know me all, right?

345
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,306
If you knew
I had already ordered.

346
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:06,785
What now?

347
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:12,040
It is late as hell.

348
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:17,253
My father hated a couple of the Night Services.

349
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:21,507
My father gave her to go home.
Him it is not obstructed.

350
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,759
Why not?

351
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:29,848
He thought that the city raises
when people go to bed.

352
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,852
City was his auspices.

353
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:40,399
It was to save from evil.

354
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:44,903
What night are you done?

355
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,283
Were man ever caught?

356
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:54,370
Scout 1-11, are you free?

357
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,142
Someone took the garbage out.

358
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,895
Russian, Asian and black
the same tomb.

359
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:24,690
Clearly gang war.

360
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:28,110
The war is over.
Chamarro is hoidellut all.

361
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,446
How many of you think we can find?

362
00:37:56,677 --> 00:38:00,890
What is wrong?
-Nothing.

363
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,437
N7B ... 9F7.

364
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:12,066
A car owned by Jason Trotter.
-Jake Jambalaya.

365
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:17,154
Pimp gangs.
Rolled Kennylle and me.

366
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:21,116
He drives kuutospiiriin.

367
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,170
Who are they?

368
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,715
That is Chamarron house.
Run the back side.

369
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:41,594
How you doing?

370
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:55,857
In this way you're treated.
Jake Suck dick, bitch!

371
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:43,609
What are you doing?

372
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:47,654
Very good run Sunday.
Now walk a little.

373
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:50,407
Without the exploration permit or anything?

374
00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:53,618
You know yourself,
what happens over there.

375
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:57,830
Invitation confirmations.
-We can not tell about this in advance.

376
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,375
I do not want to be shot.
-Come on, Stan.

377
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:05,587
If assholes aimed at us,
we will shoot them.

378
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:09,382
They have so much firepower,
We do not need to aim for.

379
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:12,552
This is fear itself.

380
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,598
When the shotgun yskäisee,
they do not shoot no longer.

381
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:23,020
If someone shoots one of them to us,
I send him to hell.

382
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:27,357
Then the other will strike fear.
I do not let them shoot you.

383
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:30,985
You know why?
You have the charisma.

384
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:34,822
What does your wife say?

385
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:39,410
That I should keep feature.
He is dependent on me.

386
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:42,454
What you distinguish them?

387
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:48,752
My death.
-What else?

388
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:55,591
What is the purpose of this is?
-Once jutustellaan.

389
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,261
You do not jutustele.
You want to hear something.

390
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,765
I do not know what you're looking for,
but you can not find it.

391
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:06,226
What scared me to ask?

392
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:19,780
Go to bed, slut.

393
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:28,788
How is it going, Jake? All right?
-Yeah. I have something for you.

394
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:33,459
Go to deal with the ropes.
But do not kiss.

395
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:44,595
How are you, Jake?
-Hey, Andy?

396
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:49,933
What the hell is it?
Who is this is a nigger?

397
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:54,103
I'll take part in the death of Kenny reason.
-Shut up.

398
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:58,190
Tell me, what is happening.
After all, we are pals.

399
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:02,152
You must believe me.
I do not relate to this way.

400
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:07,157
Do not treat me this way.
-Freeze!

401
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:11,244
Do not move.
Drug Police.

402
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:15,039
Get your hands on your head slowly.

403
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:20,336
Counting to ten. One ...
-Stop it, Andy!

404
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:23,756
Two. Three.

405
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:27,801
Four.
-Raise your hands! He is serious!

406
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:31,638
Six. Seven.
Hands-down.

407
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,558
Eight.
-Hands up!

408
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:38,978
Nine.
-He is crazy.

409
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:43,107
Nine and a half.
Not expect to ten.

410
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:27,939
Oh, hell!
Easy-just now.

411
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,531
Take me to the hospital.

412
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,950
Andy!

413
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,338
Thank you. We came here and shots
why. We were examining the area.

414
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:57,633
We opened the door, they shot.
We defended ourselves.

415
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,677
I understand.

416
00:43:59,885 --> 00:44:03,055
Drove over, and we heard
five to six shots.

417
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:07,559
We went in to call for help
to save lives.

418
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:12,105
Vaaransimme security
to protect others.

419
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:15,441
I hate it
when you treat me like a baby.

420
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:56,354
Come on!
-Have you seen any?

421
00:44:56,562 --> 00:44:59,065
Do you know anything?
-I.

422
00:44:59,273 --> 00:45:01,233
Go for it.

423
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:09,324
Ase!

424
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:17,164
We got him.

425
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,505
Barney, what have you done?
Oh, shit.

426
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:29,843
She does not have a gun.
-Oh, hell.

427
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:39,643
What did you do, Barney?
-Hell. Hell.

428
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:44,314
He aimed at us, and that's it.

429
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:56,868
Well shot.
I'll take the taxes off.

430
00:45:57,577 --> 00:46:01,914
Asshole aimed at you
and you shot him. Barney!

431
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:05,584
I understand.
-Come on now.

432
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:10,018
Here cavalry comes.

433
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:16,524
They shot at you, Jake Jambalaya.
Want to know who did it?

434
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:20,444
Fuck you.
You are in fact the killer.

435
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:27,451
It is said that the death of
freak out in stages.

436
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:30,995
You are not yet dead.
Do you have to tell.

437
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:34,540
It applies only to
that die of old age.

438
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:39,795
Not when shot at,
stupid asshole.

439
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,880
You are right.

440
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:44,883
I have the knowledge Delacroix'sta.

441
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:49,012
He was a FEMA camp
much of their time.

442
00:47:49,221 --> 00:47:51,222
Lakeview?
-Right.

443
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:53,808
See you in hell, assholes!

444
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:16,787
I've been found innocent.

445
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,085
But, four people have died
shooting in three years.

446
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:25,587
Yes, I am a good shooter.

447
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:30,759
Answering violence with violence.
-Yes.

448
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:38,057
If the door should now be second man --

449
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:41,644
aimed at my head,
what do you do?

450
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:47,899
Ampuisin him.
And I want to thank you for me.

451
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:07,125
Re wasting your time.
I'm not getting you search permission.

452
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:10,462
We try to play the judge.
-Not good enough.

453
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,173
You mikkejä
and you do the job you tapes and photos --

454
00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:18,177
and then you get the permit.
None of the judge does not apply here.

455
00:49:18,386 --> 00:49:20,721
Do not jauha shit.

456
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:26,143
Shooting Anne studied.
Be happy badge.

457
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:31,940
They do not accept it.
-Who?

458
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:34,317
I can not do anything.

459
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:40,156
You will not get permission to search FEMA camp
without the pictures and tapes.

460
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:46,036
Where do these jätkiä found?

461
00:49:46,244 --> 00:49:48,205
Goddamn cops.

462
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:03,093
Is it good?

463
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:22,945
This information. You understand?
-I understand.

464
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:32,495
What now?
-The matter is now official.

465
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:35,456
The FBI is examining my miehiäni.

466
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:39,752
The FBI received a tip
rejected a search authorization.

467
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,173
They suspect that the men do
search without a warrant.

468
00:50:45,382 --> 00:50:48,927
FBI to call me and says,
that my husband take bribes.

469
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:52,972
"If you warn them,
you are corrupt. "

470
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:56,559
Are they to blame?
-Too little pay.

471
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:00,729
The fact that they are
the police here.

472
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:06,610
What do you mean? -People
are tired of the violence.

473
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:09,529
They are tired of the city.

474
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:14,742
Does loyalty to the law
less than miehiäsi item?

475
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:20,206
Do you know them. They hakkaavat
confessions of people

476
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:23,333
They steal, and maybe worse.

477
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,420
What would you
in my situation?

478
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,548
Warn them.
-I can not.

479
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:34,260
Why are you telling me this?

480
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:44,645
We are trying to prevent the gang war.

481
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:47,314
City must build again.

482
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:51,234
Dealer for the youths are not waiting for.
They give go ahead.

483
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:54,570
And it gives you permission
do whatever you want them?

484
00:51:54,779 --> 00:52:01,535
No, but my street is not determined by
no judge or jury.

485
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:05,872
The streets, I will conclude.
I am the law.

486
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,586
What if the law is corrupt?
-You think that I am corrupt?

487
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,548
My belief does not matter.
-Bullshit.

488
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:20,761
You sectors have taken part in this.
-I get money for its avoidance.

489
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,182
But did not you see it yourself?
-What?

490
00:52:26,183 --> 00:52:30,395
The problems are many.
We try to improve the situation.

491
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:35,441
We come to work and try to
direct people to the middle of the ruins.

492
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,403
We are working on and we remain on course,
so that you can do your job.

493
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:44,408
You keep us in the same manner.
-So you want to change me.

494
00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:48,870
You want me to be softer.
Then it would be hope.

495
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:54,751
Hope the police district,
hope for the city.

496
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:57,211
Hope for you.

497
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:02,424
What are the most afraid of?

498
00:53:06,053 --> 00:53:09,472
Some other time.
Maybe.

499
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:15,228
Andy ...
Treated with this rules.

500
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:22,568
Thanks for the advice.
-It is not advised.

501
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:52,220
Hello.
-Hey.

502
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:57,308
Hello, Andy. Kuis passes?
-What did you say?

503
00:53:57,516 --> 00:54:00,936
Excuse me.
-Hey, Andy.

504
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:05,440
Turn bag.
-Shutdown the box.

505
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,110
A great TV.
-Yeah.

506
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:13,072
We received the last
insurance money.

507
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:16,159
They left a little extra.

508
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,869
Bye. Love you.

509
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:27,419
Bye.
Love you.

510
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:34,926
Cadillac us.
-No, we will take it.

511
00:54:35,134 --> 00:54:38,387
I do not want this Buickia.
It stinks.

512
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:42,891
I get to choose first.
-Mexican and Cadillac ...

513
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,437
You coming, Stan?
-Joudutaanko me this shit ämpäriin.

514
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:51,816
Why are we taking this shit?
Oh hell.

515
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:54,027
This is just shit heap.

516
00:55:13,753 --> 00:55:16,380
Ready?
-On. We look to them.

517
00:55:48,285 --> 00:55:50,203
Go on, boys.

518
00:55:57,752 --> 00:56:00,004
Hell, it's Tanya.

519
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,674
Selina!

520
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:08,303
Who?
-She gave this tip.

521
00:56:26,903 --> 00:56:30,782
Treated with this rules.
-Thank you vinkistä.

522
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:35,119
Wait. This is a trap.
-What?

523
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:40,249
What do you mean?
-This will not work without a permit.

524
00:56:40,457 --> 00:56:43,544
It has not been before to have been a barrier.

525
00:56:46,713 --> 00:56:49,007
No, no, no!

526
00:56:51,051 --> 00:56:56,139
What is happening there?
-Someone showed us.

527
00:56:57,932 --> 00:57:04,188
Are you sure it was a trap?
-I knew that something had gone wrong.

528
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:06,648
Who of us laverteli?

529
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:10,360
Friendly?
Pepe? Barney?

530
00:57:10,568 --> 00:57:14,614
Barney has been weak.
And it's not friendly. Perhaps Pepe.

531
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:28,502
You told them.

532
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,630
What are you horiset?
-They were warned against the camp.

533
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:35,550
I am not doing anything.
-Lying.

534
00:57:35,758 --> 00:57:39,553
Fuck you, Brown.
I am not afraid of you anymore.

535
00:57:39,762 --> 00:57:44,433
I am no longer cooperate.
We should perhaps look teikäläisiä.

536
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:49,271
Wait. We agreed
that the city Cleaning up.

537
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:52,524
We have the same side.
-It is my goal.

538
00:57:52,732 --> 00:57:55,777
I do not know at all
what your goals are.

539
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:59,572
I am sorry if you feel like it.
Look around.

540
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,700
No one is safe here.
No one.

541
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:07,871
Fuck you, Brown.

542
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:40,442
The FBI. You leave four under.

543
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:58,876
Call you later.

544
00:59:05,924 --> 00:59:10,637
We came to resolve
Drugs police payola problem.

545
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:14,223
We have evidence
The murder charge for.

546
00:59:16,058 --> 00:59:20,062
But before we continue,
we offer you a contract --

547
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:24,733
if you want to prove other corrupt
against police officers.

548
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:29,487
I have not seen the police
using the wrong position.

549
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:33,866
There is not a corrupt police officers.
-Not in hell.

550
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:37,453
We act according to the rules.
-You are all the same.

551
00:59:37,662 --> 00:59:41,832
Grab the offer,
because you are corrupt.

552
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:44,960
We have corruption
one of your police officers.

553
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:48,088
Did you receive someone on your side?

554
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:52,425
Idiot selling drugs
FBI-agent.

555
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:56,929
He has admitted theft,
sales and crime lavastamisen.

556
00:59:57,138 --> 01:00:00,808
She 's set piece guilty guilty?

557
01:00:01,016 --> 01:00:04,436
Tell me something new.

558
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:12,986
False evidence against the police?
-You can use him to testify.

559
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:18,824
In addition, we have a witness who
saw all murdered in the house.

560
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:23,495
He saw you and your partner
opening became a battle.

561
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:25,914
That is bullshit.

562
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:29,751
He saw you and the Former Ball
shoot weapons in a non-member.

563
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,212
Laitoitte his gun in his hand
and took his money.

564
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,924
Was there more?
In that case, I am leaving.

565
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,343
You have a mess.

566
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:44,306
You mean crack hooker?
You acknowledge, therefore, that he saw it?

567
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:50,020
If it was the crack whore,
I gave to go --

568
01:00:50,228 --> 01:00:54,107
he was certainly there,
but did not see anything.

569
01:00:55,817 --> 01:01:01,238
Ammuttaessa people are hiding.
He did not see anything at all.

570
01:01:04,032 --> 01:01:07,536
You will not find a single judge --

571
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:12,248
who believes in crack-whore-word
hero of the police against the word.

572
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:15,418
You did not call up reinforcements.

573
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:18,796
You do not want anyone to see,
how are you.

574
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:23,467
You had no suspicions. Went
only to steal and kill.

575
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:28,722
Shooting gave a reason to go inside.
We had time to call help.

576
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:36,771
Our man speaks the truth.

577
01:01:38,189 --> 01:01:42,109
We believe in him.
And so a jury believes.

578
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:47,614
We collect the evidence. It is
easy as the rain kastuminen.

579
01:01:47,823 --> 01:01:50,909
Several arrests
was invented.

580
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:56,164
Lavastitte evidence and even
you shot the innocent victims.

581
01:01:56,372 --> 01:01:59,750
They were convicted of crimes
they did not do so.

582
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:04,671
Lie. I am not a lawyer,
but I know these things something.

583
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,884
I can tell,
that this strategy will not last.

584
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:13,888
If you let the criminals free
to testify against us --

585
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:18,309
you suggest,
that they have been convicted innocent.

586
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:25,274
They employ more and more criminals,
or lawyers, and the city loses.

587
01:02:25,482 --> 01:02:28,944
All of this supposed
liars because of the police.

588
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,990
You can get us into action
if you get a second on your side.

589
01:02:34,198 --> 01:02:38,411
Only a corrupt do so
and they are not living up to testify.

590
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:45,584
The rule of thumb is that the drug world
is always a corrupt law enforcement.

591
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:50,463
Corrupt police officers, prosecutors,
corrupt CIA and the FBI.

592
01:02:50,672 --> 01:02:53,800
But police want to
scapegoats.

593
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:57,511
One more thing.
You did just a crime --

594
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,765
disclosing
The FBI, the identity of the witness.

595
01:03:01,974 --> 01:03:06,353
I told you anything.
-Said that it is a corrupt cop.

596
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:10,565
How long do you think that it will take,
until we find him?

597
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,902
Write the reports --

598
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:19,198
that Jake Jambalaya reported important
information prior to his death.

599
01:03:19,406 --> 01:03:22,326
I tell them to you.

600
01:03:22,534 --> 01:03:25,871
But he said it,
what I wanted to know.

601
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,207
How do you get the suspects to talk?

602
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:32,794
It is hard to describe,
but I can tell.

603
01:03:33,002 --> 01:03:36,839
I can imagine.
-Tell me everything.

604
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:40,759
I do not in any case tell
you anything.

605
01:03:40,968 --> 01:03:43,137
You do not know to whom you talk.

606
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,102
You are the witnesses.

607
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:56,190
I blame these pellejä
FBI-disclosure of the witness.

608
01:04:01,528 --> 01:04:05,866
If you and your husband have exceeded this limit,
I can not protect you.

609
01:04:07,617 --> 01:04:10,203
I'm sorry.
-Listen to me.

610
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:14,540
They are the earnest.
-You think I fear prison?

611
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:19,795
I fear that you do not reach the prison until.
-No, you have to be involved.

612
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:41,148
Me and Stan did not let on.
-I do not look laver.

613
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:44,943
We find out who lavertelee
and building a trap for him.

614
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:48,321
Shoot at him.
-No, it is not.

615
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,909
What about the witness, Andy?
-I gave her to go.

616
01:04:53,117 --> 01:04:58,039
He did not know anything.
Small fearful junkie.

617
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:01,625
You varastitte,
and you gave me a contribution.

618
01:05:03,252 --> 01:05:06,380
Yes you get a share.
-Moron!

619
01:05:06,588 --> 01:05:09,633
He defrauded you
uncover it.

620
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:14,095
What else you laverrellut?
-I did not know that varastitte.

621
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:18,265
I did not know that he is a witness,
because I did not know the offense.

622
01:05:18,474 --> 01:05:21,143
And I do not want to share that
because I did not steal.

623
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:26,440
Do I understand ten o'clock käskyäsi
right? Stealing is a bad thing.

624
01:05:26,648 --> 01:05:29,734
But lying, pieksäminen,
killing --

625
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:33,613
Liberalization of witnesses,
because you want to marry, it is good?

626
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:38,034
You have the Bible as an idiot.
-I 'm not married drug addicts.

627
01:05:38,242 --> 01:05:41,996
I have not hit anybody,
who has not shot me first.

628
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:46,041
I have not killed anyone,
which is not shot at me. Roughly.

629
01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:50,003
It is a sick hint,
that the use of the junkie.

630
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:55,758
Your girl gave us tips.
-I will show him the place.

631
01:05:55,967 --> 01:06:02,264
If you talk to me about yet,
you will have a disastrous accident.

632
01:06:08,937 --> 01:06:11,481
Goddamn fool.
-Andy!

633
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:17,111
He led me to the trap.
What could I do?

634
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,657
Rode a child too much
Bob Eno's arms or what?

635
01:06:21,865 --> 01:06:25,994
Asshole.
-Barney, now stop.

636
01:06:26,203 --> 01:06:29,623
Why you can not keep the mouth closed?
-Come on now.

637
01:06:34,544 --> 01:06:36,963
Tanya, Barney here.

638
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:43,844
I do not like it.
Take up arms.

639
01:06:44,928 --> 01:06:46,513
Now.

640
01:07:00,818 --> 01:07:02,528
Shit!

641
01:07:11,578 --> 01:07:15,706
Play Now
larger stakes.

642
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,668
Come, go down.

643
01:07:23,714 --> 01:07:28,385
They cut the languages.
-Incredible ...

644
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:32,305
He is no longer nuole
badge.

645
01:07:35,183 --> 01:07:38,144
All right, darling.

646
01:07:38,352 --> 01:07:41,438
Come on, Barney!
-I miss you.

647
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:10,215
The case is not ready.
Why tell us? -Säikyttelyä.

648
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:16,762
This park was filled with dealer for the youths,
but we Siivosen it.

649
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:20,266
Forget about this park.
-I can not.

650
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:25,687
My dad found here.
Was not found.

651
01:08:26,688 --> 01:08:29,858
I do not know what he looks like --

652
01:08:30,066 --> 01:08:33,444
but I have seen
his face a thousand times.

653
01:08:33,653 --> 01:08:37,198
I jahdannut him for years.
Now I will stop.

654
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:43,412
We can not fight the FBI's receipt.
Maybe we should just give up.

655
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,457
They want to export weapons,
so that we can not manage the park --

656
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:51,002
and then we lose the town.
This is my city.

657
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,590
You are too deep.
Loosen a little.

658
01:09:14,148 --> 01:09:17,443
What do you do?
I have a wonderful stuff.

659
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:21,155
Drug Police.
Hands on your head.

660
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:25,909
Turn around.

661
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:29,329
Great, that obeys.

662
01:09:29,537 --> 01:09:33,499
If you do not answer my questions,
scatter your kneecap.

663
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:37,253
I understand.
-This is my park.

664
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,798
The park is for trade purposes.

665
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:45,177
Well I did not want to hear.
There may be shot.

666
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:48,138
I am a subcontractor.
-Who?

667
01:09:48,346 --> 01:09:51,850
For the Spanish Florida.

668
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:57,021
Latin Kings?
-They have to accept everything.

669
01:09:57,229 --> 01:10:00,191
Tell me the name.
Tell me the name!

670
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:02,776
Chamarro.
-Where?

671
01:10:02,985 --> 01:10:06,655
FEMA's camp.
From there, I acquired stuff.

672
01:10:06,863 --> 01:10:09,157
What you are now found in the top?

673
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:12,493
What is available?
-20 On crack.

674
01:10:12,702 --> 01:10:15,913
Earn 200 bucks
or seated in 5 - 10 years in prison.

675
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:19,708
It is not worth it.
The ski park hell.

676
01:10:21,085 --> 01:10:22,795
Run!

677
01:10:23,796 --> 01:10:26,882
Where did he hide the stuff?
Ass

678
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:36,474
Thompson submachine gun.
Tommy-gun.

679
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:40,186
600 shots per minute.
Quite well in 1921.

680
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:48,777
Davey Johnson. City
all-time great lawyer.

681
01:10:48,985 --> 01:10:51,988
Thanks, Andy.
-I have questions.

682
01:10:52,197 --> 01:10:55,658
Every time you raise a prosecution
pahista point --

683
01:10:55,867 --> 01:11:01,038
do equally well, because it
operates. To you it goes. So far so good.

684
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:07,294
When was the last time you have seen
police certificate unreliable?

685
01:11:07,502 --> 01:11:12,048
The judges and the prosecutor's office
will cooperate with us.

686
01:11:12,257 --> 01:11:16,594
I mean, we are your support,
we facilitate your work.

687
01:11:16,802 --> 01:11:20,890
Now the FBI nuuskii places.
We can not prevent.

688
01:11:21,098 --> 01:11:24,309
But if you give the FBI
use us scapegoats --

689
01:11:24,518 --> 01:11:29,064
I am of all with me.
Be taken to the press like hell.

690
01:11:29,272 --> 01:11:33,651
The judges are always in front of me
presented practical prosecutors.

691
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:38,989
Do you know how many I have received
locked up? Get the license!

692
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,535
I put hard against.
I would like to search the permit.

693
01:11:43,744 --> 01:11:47,581
Sorry, but as long
than the FBI is examining you --

694
01:11:47,789 --> 01:11:51,459
none of the judge
does not give you permission to search.

695
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:55,630
As soon as I tried.
We are so close.

696
01:11:58,716 --> 01:12:01,844
Goddamn lawyers.
-Fucking cops.

697
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:22,154
That's quite a poky hole.
-The cops ratsasivat home.

698
01:12:22,363 --> 01:12:26,783
You know, many men were lost?
-Do you want to nose cloth?

699
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:31,079
You could have warned me!

700
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:35,458
Do you think that this is the game!

701
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:39,545
You wanted to clean the city
mess with their own hands.

702
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:43,590
Watching another
seized when the other gangs.

703
01:12:43,799 --> 01:12:48,011
All win.
-Why did the bodies were put into the swamp?

704
01:12:49,638 --> 01:12:52,182
It was sloppy.

705
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:56,936
Please beads,
but do not show tissejäsi.

706
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:04,818
If ryssit yet again,
I will kill you. Do you understand?

707
01:13:11,741 --> 01:13:15,203
Are you doing to me
one more favor.

708
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:21,388
Everyone has murtumispiste,
is it true?

709
01:14:22,806 --> 01:14:25,559
It is not only self-aware in advance --

710
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:29,854
and afterwards it is too late,
nor deeds can be undone.

711
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:35,943
Are you close to murtumispistettäsi?

712
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:43,283
Työparin with is like a marriage.

713
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:47,370
It is a two-man
integrity agreement.

714
01:14:48,455 --> 01:14:51,749
What is your and Andy's happened between?

715
01:14:53,626 --> 01:14:58,255
I feel like I did a suicide
and change my mind at the last minute.

716
01:14:59,882 --> 01:15:04,386
Suddenly, I get it the joy of life,
which I did not realize that I have.

717
01:15:05,804 --> 01:15:10,850
I understand that.
I understand very well.

718
01:15:18,774 --> 01:15:22,528
What caused this?
-The FBI.

719
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:26,615
They will follow us.
Want to destroy us.

720
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:32,412
You have nothing to fear
if the supply rules.

721
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,373
What does that even mean nowadays?

722
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,336
Like Andy says:

723
01:15:40,544 --> 01:15:44,173
It is difficult to work paskassa
and to become a clean home.

724
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:46,633
But he does so.

725
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:51,137
All other
consume a little shit at home.

726
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:54,849
He comes home to clean.
-What about you?

727
01:15:57,601 --> 01:16:03,190
Recently, I have done things,
I do not particularly proud of.

728
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:10,405
Have you violated the law?
-I am probably stretched it a little.

729
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:15,535
But the FBI is wrong.
They are chasing the condition of men.

730
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:20,539
I do not know
how can I fight against it.

731
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:31,049
Just tell me the truth.
When things do not go wrong.

732
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:39,473
I do not even know what the truth is anymore.

733
01:16:41,975 --> 01:16:47,689
Police issued HIGH
John Friendly murder.

734
01:16:47,898 --> 01:16:51,443
He was shot in
in front of their homes in New Orleans.

735
01:16:51,651 --> 01:16:55,363
Witnesses, two masked men
shot by friendly --

736
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:58,616
this comes home
22 Kelo's time today.

737
01:16:58,824 --> 01:17:04,037
John Friendly pacify
gangs controlled the streets.

738
01:17:04,246 --> 01:17:06,957
He was the policeman of 30 years.

739
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:10,377
He was sure was not the
wife and three children.

740
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:13,421
The FBI is examining the case.

741
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:19,135
HIGH John Friendly
was murdered tonight.

742
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:04,593
Do you think that it is he?

743
01:18:06,136 --> 01:18:11,474
I do not know. Pepe has been bribed,
but this is too big.

744
01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:15,478
Who it is,
we have bigger enemies.

745
01:18:15,686 --> 01:18:17,229
Who?

746
01:18:17,438 --> 01:18:21,275
He sold his soul FBI.
That house has been bribed.

747
01:18:24,361 --> 01:18:27,781
They killed Friendly
and we turn next.

748
01:18:29,616 --> 01:18:33,411
I represent the city.
I do not eat fish club.

749
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,581
If I am not respected,
I lutkat slaughtered. Shut-kii.

750
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,002
Barney is ready.

751
01:18:46,339 --> 01:18:51,094
Going without a confirmation?
-There is a hell cops soon.

752
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:54,055
When they come to arrest us.

753
01:18:55,681 --> 01:19:00,019
Are we even the cops anymore?
The time-far from it.

754
01:19:58,864 --> 01:20:01,075
Drug Police!

755
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,910
Drop your weapon!

756
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:59,128
Who is a contact?
-I 'm not a snitch.

757
01:21:08,303 --> 01:21:09,721
Damn!

758
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:16,686
Why would you even heräsit morning?

759
01:21:24,109 --> 01:21:27,779
Who is a contact?
-I am not a snitch.

760
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:33,951
Tell it before he kills you.
-Who is a contact?

761
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:47,881
I made the contract the FBI.
I had to destroy the other gangs.

762
01:21:49,299 --> 01:21:53,678
Brown told us
when the future was the raids.

763
01:21:53,886 --> 01:21:56,556
He warned us
search authorizations.

764
01:21:56,764 --> 01:22:00,351
He would pay guarantees
where we will end up.

765
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:07,941
They dominate
airports and borders.

766
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:13,237
Corrupt cops.
You are all the same.

767
01:22:48,895 --> 01:22:50,605
Pepe!

768
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:55,693
I did not know that it is you.
I have seen.

769
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:02,866
Excuse me.

770
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:05,160
Stop!

771
01:23:20,716 --> 01:23:22,801
Are you okay?
-I.

772
01:23:39,108 --> 01:23:41,944
Are you all right, Barney?
-He is dead.

773
01:23:42,152 --> 01:23:44,321
Who?
-Pepe.

774
01:23:44,529 --> 01:23:49,326
I killed him.
I do not deliberately, Andy.

775
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:53,496
Pepe is dead.
Pepe is dead.

776
01:24:01,587 --> 01:24:05,382
Drug Agency gave
Latin King Sille power.

777
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,177
Where should we go?
-Where we met.

778
01:24:11,054 --> 01:24:13,640
There, it all began.

779
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:18,227
You now have a new pair.
You trust him?

780
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:20,479
Shoot him, Stan!

781
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:25,692
I can borrow money.
-Me pärjätään.

782
01:24:27,736 --> 01:24:29,738
Fine gogglebox

783
01:24:32,282 --> 01:24:34,992
We have corruption
one of your men.

784
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:40,080
You are too deep.
Relax a little.

785
01:24:51,257 --> 01:24:55,303
Have they changed over here?
-Kamat are here.

786
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:59,807
It looks clean.
Examined in places?

787
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:02,518
No, Stan.

788
01:25:02,726 --> 01:25:05,228
Here we met.

789
01:25:08,857 --> 01:25:12,569
Do you have to tell me?
-No.

790
01:25:17,823 --> 01:25:21,160
Do you have to tell me?
-No.

791
01:25:33,046 --> 01:25:37,300
I made a mistake. I needed the money
when the baby was coming.

792
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:43,430
Then came Hurricane.
I do not save the world like you.

793
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:48,143
I have to earn their livelihood.
I earned enough.

794
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:52,272
You are a father, hell.
-Are you gonna shoot me?

795
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,024
You are a traitor.

796
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:59,612
Were Brown breads and the like
Prosecutor turned kimpustani.

797
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:07,202
You lied to flooding up to.

798
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:11,539
Every day, every hour.
Ruined my investigation.

799
01:26:11,748 --> 01:26:15,918
Brown made me stick
when I took the money. I'm not perfect.

800
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:19,755
I'm not me, either.
But I am työparisi.

801
01:26:20,923 --> 01:26:24,134
It did not involve you at all.

802
01:26:25,093 --> 01:26:28,471
It happened
before I met you.

803
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,599
You partner,
and I want to help you.

804
01:26:31,808 --> 01:26:34,852
But you have to sit down.
-What do you mean?

805
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:38,355
I will be happy to assist you,
but you have to jail.

806
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:44,861
I do not have nowhere to go.
-You 're not shoot me.

807
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:48,615
I am your partner.
-What I should have done?

808
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:52,619
What I had to do?
-I do not know, Stan.

809
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:07,521
Calculate the gun, the dealer for the youths.
-I am the FBI to, I am no dealer for the youths.

810
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:10,815
Chamarro talked about.
You stay up.

811
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:15,570
I had to use Chamarroa.
We have the same side.

812
01:28:16,445 --> 01:28:20,449
This is over, Brown.
-I'm still here.

813
01:28:20,658 --> 01:28:23,702
That is the pig,
you are jahdannut throughout your life.

814
01:28:23,911 --> 01:28:28,248
Let me shoot him.
-Not good enough. He was considered reserves.

815
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:33,711
I can make you a good offer.
-Do not go to that yarn.

816
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,089
This must be resolved now.
-Please help a little.

817
01:28:42,428 --> 01:28:46,390
The case is now closed.
-Agree on what happened.

818
01:28:48,099 --> 01:28:52,478
Agree with what happened?
-Kai me this is silent?

819
01:28:52,687 --> 01:28:56,065
We're a pair.
I know that you do not look laver.

820
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:06,116
We do not have much time.
-Agree on what happened.

821
01:29:09,035 --> 01:29:12,705
We were forced to
to defend ourselves and shoot.

822
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,499
Say it.

823
01:29:14,707 --> 01:29:19,545
I was forced to shoot.

824
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:39,563
Ammuitko are you him?

825
01:29:40,731 --> 01:29:45,235
Ampuiko he himself?
Was it an accident?

826
01:29:49,197 --> 01:29:52,325
Wished he ..?
-He was my partner.

827
01:30:08,048 --> 01:30:10,175
Are you all right, Andy?

828
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:30,457
3 years after Katrina
