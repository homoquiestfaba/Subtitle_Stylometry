1
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,767
I want the graves
kept neat.

2
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,597
Your parents.

3
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,686
My grandparents.

4
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,079
You knew them ?

5
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,083
I was a young boy
when I knew them.

6
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:02,834
I want you to buy a plot for
me beside my grandfather.

7
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,924
There is no room.

8
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,932
Then as close
as possible.

9
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,240
I'll have to...

10
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,416
Buy it.

11
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,172
You're coming ?

12
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,089
I have a
few hours to kill.

13
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,612
I don't. I don't
speak yiddish.

14
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,919
I'm looking for
something for my wife.

15
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,747
You have these candlesticks
in the window.

16
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,444
I have to close
up for an hour.

17
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,316
I'm going out to pray.

18
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,719
Would you like to
come back in an hour ?

19
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,073
Maybe come with me.

20
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,694
First visit
to Israel ?

21
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:49,436
Yeah, it's
my first visit.

22
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,526
But I've already
been here a year.

23
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,470
[ Yelling ]

24
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,356
[ Hebrew ]

25
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,471
[ Male ]
...Winner
right there.

26
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:52,826
Let's see
money here, boys.

27
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:54,654
More you bet
more you get.

28
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,177
Okay, that's six
bits, you got four ?

29
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,395
Two bits,
two bits.

30
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,701
You got it.
You got it ?

31
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,311
Alright. Coming out,
coming out.

32
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,661
We got a winner.

33
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,140
Alright, yeah.

34
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,014
See what
you got here ?

35
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,319
It's a seven,
it's a seven.

36
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,581
We got a winner.

37
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:10,800
Here we go.

38
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,280
Pay it up,
pay it up.

39
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,368
Who's up ?

40
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,499
Who's shooting what ?

41
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,892
What's happening ?

42
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,198
Batter up.

43
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:19,287
Can't win if
you do not play ?

44
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,375
Who's the new shooter ?

45
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,419
We need a new shooter.

46
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,987
Nearly a year is
more than a visit.

47
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:09,903
How much longer
will you be here ?

48
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,688
One or two
more days.

49
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,343
Or many years.

50
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,136
I wish my grandfather
could have seen them.

51
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,661
An army.

52
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,273
You know, the saddest
thing a friend told me.

53
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,231
Bunch of your
school children,

54
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:36,973
eight years old.

55
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,236
They were telling
them about Europe.

56
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,891
About the holocaust.

57
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:45,416
One of the kids says,
why didn't we send our army ?

58
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,162
Why didn't we
send our army ?

59
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:53,903
Yeah.

60
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:12,617
You can join me or meet
me back at the shop or...

61
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,489
I'll wait here.

62
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,580
Nice in the sun,
isn't it ?

63
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,234
Yeah, well,
you know.

64
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,366
Get old.

65
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:23,803
It's warm.

66
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,980
Good place
to live.

67
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,157
I think so.

68
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:08,499
The more you bet,
the more you get.

69
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,979
Shoot 'em.

70
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:20,424
It's his
left hand.

71
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:21,773
Place your bets, boys,
place your bets.

72
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,601
The more you bet,
the more you get.

73
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:24,820
See, Benny ?

74
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,692
See ?

75
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:28,868
Place your
bets, boys.

76
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,739
See what
we got here.

77
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,001
Alright,

78
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,133
shoot 'em,
shoot 'em.

79
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,221
Coming up.

80
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,526
Can't win 'em all.

81
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,354
Alright.

82
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,878
Here you go,
here you go.

83
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,357
I'm bettin'
wit you.

84
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,316
Too late.

85
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:43,926
Snake eyes.

86
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,058
Can't win 'em all,
can't win 'em all.

87
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,624
Hey, you owe
me the four bits.

88
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,452
No dice on
the last shot.

89
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,801
You collected
his money.

90
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:50,977
What the fuck you mean,
no dice, you owe me.

91
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,021
Fuck off !

92
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,283
Hey, no,
you owe me !

93
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,894
Get them
out of here.

94
00:14:58,593 --> 00:14:59,594
Are you crazy ?

95
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,551
Are you out
of your mind ?

96
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,813
You want to fight ?

97
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:02,902
I'll fight you.

98
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,120
You want to fight ?

99
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,426
I'll fight
you with nothing.

100
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,080
Throw down
the knife.

101
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,257
Throw down
the fucking knife !

102
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,954
We'll fight you
with nothing.

103
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,477
Are you crazy ?

104
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:14,914
We won the money !

105
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:17,786
We made the bet,
are you fucking nuts ?

106
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
Get the fuck
out of here.

107
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,184
You worked for it.

108
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,750
Pick it up.

109
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,274
You win
the money, meyer.

110
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,450
Bunch of kikes.

111
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,321
You bunch
of sheenies.

112
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,193
Here I am !

113
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:34,629
Here I am !

114
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,458
Here I am,
you fucking Mick pansy.

115
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,547
Here I am,
you cock sucker.

116
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,244
You want
to kill me ?

117
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,377
Here I am.

118
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,686
You're crazy.

119
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,302
Are you okay ?

120
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,173
Meyer, are you okay ?

121
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,959
Yeah.

122
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,223
Thanks, Benny.

123
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,712
Two things.

124
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,714
Listening to me ?

125
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,935
Wade in and
never fight fair.

126
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,764
That's my advice
to you.

127
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,070
Anything else you'll figure
out for yourself...

128
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,724
What do you mean
never fight fair ?

129
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,335
Why'd you drop
the brick ?

130
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,163
Don't always go by me.

131
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,556
Gets your heart beating,
don't it ?

132
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,297
Fighting ?

133
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,343
Pick up your money.

134
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,435
Shh.

135
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,569
You do whatever you want
to do with this, okay ?

136
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,962
Whatever brings
you pleasure.

137
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,834
But never...

138
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:35,271
Never gamble,
jakelah.

139
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,970
Unless it's your game.

140
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,063
Shh.

141
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,415
He stilled the rising
tumult...

142
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,373
He had
the game go on.

143
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,115
And with a smile of
Christian charity.

144
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:55,204
Great Casey's visage...

145
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,901
Should be a smile
of Jewish charity.

146
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,338
Oh, no doubt.

147
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,861
But that's not how
that misguided

148
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,645
son-of-a-bitch wrote it.

149
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,779
Somewhere in this
favored land.

150
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,088
Somewhere bands are playing
and children shout.

151
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,481
But there was
not joy in mudville.

152
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:12,526
Hey !

153
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,310
It's the kikes.

154
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,007
Take it off.

155
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,444
Take it all off !

156
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,228
Show 'em !

157
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,144
Show 'em where they cut your
dick off, you Christ killers.

158
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,494
You're gonna pollute
the river, you Christ killers.

159
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,540
You people
killed Christ !

160
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,020
My people didn't have
time to kill Christ.

161
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,500
You know why ?

162
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,023
'Cause we've been
fucking your mother

163
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,504
for five
thousand years.

164
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,214
Why is a Jew like
a featherbed ?

165
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,102
What does
it do for you...

166
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,408
To pray ?

167
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,715
Who rises refreshed
from his prayers,

168
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,500
his prayers have
been answered.

169
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,199
And that's
the truth ?

170
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,201
I've found it to
be the truth.

171
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:04,681
Even for
somebody like me ?

172
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,078
You know who I am.

173
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,820
I also knew who
you were in '48.

174
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,735
I was with haganah.

175
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,650
I unloaded some
of the guns.

176
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,129
Rumors, you know ?

177
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,088
They had come from
the docks of New York

178
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,569
through the good offices
of yourself.

179
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,095
You think your supreme court
will remember that

180
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,228
in their
arguments today ?

181
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,099
I would hope so.

182
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,319
So...

183
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,103
Let me ask
you a question.

184
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,800
Please.

185
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,239

00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,903
to the United States
justice department

910
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,166
and I get my Israeli
citizenship tomorrow.

911
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,738
There was no mafia.

912
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:01,869
What was it ?

913
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,305
It must have
been the Jews.

914
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:05,830
It was the Jews,
that's who it must have been.

915
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,877
And if it was the Jews,
it must have been me.

916
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:14,273
What am I
demeaning myself ?

917
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:20,932
And I'll tell you.

918
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:23,935
One country's
like another.

919
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,329
What do you
think of that ?

920
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:38,645
Two guys are walking
down the street.

921
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:40,081
Walking towards 'em,
here comes Joe.

922
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:42,867
Joe crosses the street
he shies away.

923
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:44,259
One guy says
to the other guy,

924
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,739
I don't know why
Joe's avoiding me,

925
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,001
I haven't done anything
for him lately.

926
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:50,352
The shit we did.

927
00:58:50,483 --> 00:58:51,919
You know how
much armament

928
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,573
we put through
the Brooklyn pier in '48 ?

929
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,009
Do you know ?i know.

930
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,967
Ah, you don't know.

931
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,708
But they know.

932
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:01,712
The law of return.

933
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:04,236
Every Jew on earth has
a homeland to come to.

934
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:09,371
Zion.

935
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:12,723
We used to say,

936
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:15,116
nobody loves
the Jews.

937
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:18,250
Charlie loved
the Jews.

938
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,296
Used to think he
had a pintele yid.

939
00:59:24,778 --> 00:59:25,823
You know what ?

940
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:27,738
Forget about it.

941
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,087
Where are
we going ?

942
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:31,393
It's not over
here, yet.

943
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:32,351
Yeah.

944
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:34,614
Where are
we going ?

945
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:36,616
For now,
go home, meyer.

946
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,662
Zev will call you the minute
he hears from the court.

947
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:46,278
Four bedrooms.

948
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:47,845
"A lovely
little house",

949
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:49,803
the real estate
woman called it.

950
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:51,631
In the German sector.

951
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:54,112
And she
was right.

952
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,766
Lovely.

953
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,551
Paul called and
buddy and Sandra.

954
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:05,863
They all want to
come next week.

955
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:08,387
I hope you told
them to wait until--

956
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:11,303
we're moved
in and settled.

957
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,655
Four bedrooms, meyer.

958
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:17,178
Room.

959
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:18,353
You should have
waited until--

960
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:21,879
there is
a law of return, meyer.

961
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:23,663
Not a policy.

962
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,099
A law.

963
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,536
They won't put US...

964
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,626
[ Phone ringing ]

965
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:38,896
Yeah.

966
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,332
Mr. Lansky, could you
please give me a comment

967
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:41,986
on your expulsion
from Israel ?

968
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:44,466
Mr. Lansky was not expelled,
his tourist visa expired--

969
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:47,513
but surely you might reflect
that man with drug charges.

970
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,776
I beg your pardon !

971
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:53,780
My husband was harassed
by the u.S. Department--

972
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:55,173
my husband had a vial,

973
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:56,391
excuse me,

974
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,697
of donnatol,

975
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,394
which is an antacid,
do you understand ?

976
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:01,266
For his ulcer.

977
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:03,398
An antacid and
we were detained.

978
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:06,314
We were searched,
we were questioned !

979
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:08,447
How does it
feel as a Jew ?

980
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:10,667
Mr. Lansky is not inclined,
if you might imagine,

981
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:12,756
to answer any further
questions at this time.

982
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:14,148
As a Jew--

983
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,270
After the second war,

984
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:52,273
three Jews,
meet in a d.P. Camp.

985
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:55,581
Discuss plans for
where they'll go.

986
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,759
First Jew says,
"I'm gonna settle in england."

987
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,632
Second Jew says, "uh-huh,
I'm going to Canada."

988
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:07,462
Third Jew goes,
"I'm going to Australia."

989
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:11,292
First Jew says, "isn't
that a long way ?"

990
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:15,514
Third Jew says,
"from where ?"

991
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:22,651
From where ?

992
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:45,647
Paul, your father's in the
study, he'll just be a minute.

993
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:46,910
Come here.

994
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,041
A pile of books
like that...

995
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:49,260
You're going
to go blind.

996
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,001
That's something else.Fresh mouth.

997
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,785
Where do you
get it from ?

998
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,221
Alright, now,
where was I, Evelyn ?

999
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:56,136
The plant
and the dog.

1000
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:57,616
Hold the mail.

1001
01:03:57,746 --> 01:03:59,096
Meyer.

1002
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:00,706
You tell him,
you say to the guy,

1003
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,535
you have a grave
responsibility.

1004
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:04,971
Of course you do.

1005
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:07,669
You have the worries,
not only of your office.

1006
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,370
So on, but of being
re-elected to that office.

1007
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,937
You're under
a lot of pressure.

1008
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:17,244
Now, we have
legitimate interests.

1009
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,072
Not only
in hallandale.

1010
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:21,553
But in the development
of Florida as do you.

1011
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:22,554
Dad.

1012
01:04:22,684 --> 01:04:23,990
Yeah.

1013
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,818
It's goodbye, huh ?

1014
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:27,124
Have a good time.

1015
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,777
I will.

1016
01:04:31,563 --> 01:04:33,739
Take good care
of things here.

1017
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,959
So when do we hear
from the point ?

1018
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,134
Dad.

1019
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:39,049
We aren't gonna
hear for two weeks.

1020
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,181
You let me know.

1021
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:43,140
You got
my itinerary ?

1022
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,230
You let me know
the moment you know.

1023
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,101
I will.

1024
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:49,276
Okay.

1025
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,800
You be good.

1026
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,850
Nice kid.

1027
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,765
He's a helluva kid.

1028
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,462
Is he gonna get in ?

1029
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:04,726
Kinahora.

1030
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:06,859
The Jewish quota
up there is this big.

1031
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:11,211
Where are we ?

1032
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:12,778
Kindergarten.

1033
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,128
Alright.

1034
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:17,652
Blah, blah, yeah.

1035
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:19,524
Legal fees.

1036
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:21,961
So to protect
my interests.

1037
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:25,965
Hey !

1038
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:30,448
I was staying home and I had
the time I'd go down there.

1039
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,319
But as I'm not,
you're going,

1040
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,974
so pay attention
'cause you muck this up--

1041
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:36,671
how high
are we going ?

1042
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:41,328
I would say we
get this guy twenty.

1043
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:44,070
Go as high
as 50k.

1044
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,985
Hmm,

1045
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:47,378
if he wants higher.

1046
01:05:47,508 --> 01:05:49,075
Let's discuss it.

1047
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:54,124
The car is here, meyer.

1048
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,822
Goodbye, dad.

1049
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,563
Alright,
let's get going.

1050
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,044
Take care of
yourself, buddy.

1051
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:02,828
Thank you, Jackie.

1052
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,439
Federal bureau
of investigation.

1053
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,485
You meyer lansky ?

1054
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:17,712
Drugs.

1055
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:21,542
Well, as I told you,
there aren't any drugs.

1056
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:25,198
That's donnatol.

1057
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:28,723
That's a prescription antacid,

1058
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:30,769
and if you find
anything else,

1059
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,510
I'll tell you what.

1060
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,902
You put it there.

1061
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,730
You people.

1062
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:38,298
You've been watching
me so close, so long.

1063
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:41,127
You know, I don't
touch a goddamn--

1064
01:06:41,258 --> 01:06:42,520
I'm a gambler.

1065
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,783
I'm a gambler, pally.

1066
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:47,264
I'm a common gambler.

1067
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:50,267
Then why are
we here, sir ?

1068
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:52,921
Isn't that smart ?

1069
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:56,273
What happened to
innocent until proven ?

1070
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:57,839
Huh ?

1071
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,754
Why are you here ?

1072
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:03,932
You're here because
of the same reason

1073
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,718
that you go anywhere
to get publicity.

1074
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:10,939
Get publicity.

1075
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,289
It's good copy.

1076
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:13,986
Interviewing
meyer lansky.

1077
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,814
Who the hell do you
think you are, son ?

1078
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:17,990
Who the hell do you
think you work for ?

1079
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,167
I came here
with nothing !

1080
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,778
I served
my country !

1081
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:31,047
I got a son who's
going to west point.

1082

You ?

1085
01:07:36,182 --> 01:07:37,096
What do you do ?

1086
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:38,532
Son.

1087
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:41,274
You just tore up my home
in front of my wife,

Mr. Lansky,
good to see you.

1099

I come all
the way from sicily

1100
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:57,454
to deal with
this business about Benny.

1101
01:09:57,584 --> 01:09:59,282
Hey, you know
how Benny is.

1102
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:01,284
Charlie, c'mon.

1103
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,425
You know
what it is ?

1104
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:13,644
I'll tell you
what it is.

1105
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:15,123
It's cum.

1106
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,908
It's only in his balls
is not what I mean.

1107
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,692
It's in his body,
you see.

1108
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:20,738
It's in his body
up to here.

1109

Up to here
all the time.

1110
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:24,524
He can't see
it's over his eyes.

1111
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:28,006
So he comes,
it goes down

1112
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:30,269
so the guys can see out ten,
fifteen minutes

1113
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,705
until it builds
back up.

1114

blind again.

his faults, Charlie.

1207

been cheaper,

that or a doorknob ?

1209

Well, no, a doorknob
would have been cheaper,

1211

with the passport.

1264
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:54,435
This passport.

1265
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:57,874
My client, Mr. Lansky,

1266
01:16:58,004 --> 01:17:00,354
is seeking asylum
in your country.

1267
01:17:00,485 --> 01:17:04,707
Asylum for the reasons
that I have spelled out.

1268
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:09,233
I'm sure that when we,
if you will forgive me,

1269
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,409
reached a level
sufficiently high.

1270
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:12,715
To allow--

1271
01:17:12,845 --> 01:17:15,326
what does
your client do ?

1272
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:16,588
What ?

1273
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,546
It's a simple
question.

1274
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,593
This is a
simple question.

1275
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,726
Don't tell me
it's a simple question.

1276
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:24,770
If it was--

1277
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:26,206
please.

1278
01:17:26,337 --> 01:17:27,947
[ Crying ]

1279
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:29,906
We wouldn't--

1280
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,211
the teacher.

1281
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:34,519
It is not the teacher
I have issue with.

1282
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,479
The boy is being
hazed at school.

1283
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,091
Meyer, he's being
hazed at school.

1284
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:42,570
You think
that's remarkable ?

1285
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,921
He's being hazed.

1286
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,009
What is this ?

1287
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:47,227
You've been
reading a book.

1288
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,103
That's what's
happened.

1289
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:01,938
What ?

1290
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:04,027
What do you want
to do tonight ?

1291
01:18:04,157 --> 01:18:05,985
Buddy ?

1292
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:09,467
Excuse me
a minute.

1293
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:11,991
Hey, dad.

1294
01:18:12,122 --> 01:18:13,732
You going
tonight ?

1295
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:15,299
Yeah, I'm going
for a trip.

1296
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:16,909
Where you going ?

1297
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,258
You know.

1298
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:21,479
I'm going to several
places on business.

1299
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:29,617
You know...

1300
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:32,925
Let me tell
you something.

1301
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:36,233
People dislike what
they do not understand.

1302
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:39,453
What do you
think about that ?

1303
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:48,419
When I was a kid,
I saw things,

1304
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:50,116
which I won't
bore you with

1305
01:18:50,247 --> 01:18:54,164
which were upsetting.

1306
01:18:57,167 --> 01:19:01,345
Now and I'll tell you
how I feel about that.

1307
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:05,392
You don't have to give it
magical significance,

1308
01:19:05,523 --> 01:19:09,222
you see things happen to upset
you, you can look at them.

1309
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:10,615
You can look
at them.

1310
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,748
And say
that happened.

1311
01:19:14,184 --> 01:19:15,576
Or you know what ?

1312
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:17,970
You can look at
them and say,

1313
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:20,756
that happened
and I'm still here.

1314
01:19:25,064 --> 01:19:26,674
And here I am.

1315
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:30,026
Now, it's
in the past.

1316
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:36,293
Now people say things
about your father, your family.

1317
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:41,515
Be advised this happens
all over the world,

1318
01:19:41,646 --> 01:19:43,343
people don't like you
because you're a Jew,

1319
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:45,215
you're a catholic,

1320
01:19:45,345 --> 01:19:47,521
it doesn't make
any difference.

1321
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,741
That's part of life.

1322
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:57,662
Now what's upsetting you
is maybe they're right.

1323
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:06,192
Your father is
a businessman.

1324
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:09,500
That's what I do.

1325
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,416
Now it happens
that I am involved,

1326
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,722
among other things,

1327
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:16,463
and this is just
for your benefit

1328
01:20:16,594 --> 01:20:19,553
because our family's finances
are nobody else's concern

1329
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:23,906
in real estate, in hotels,
in entertainment.

1330
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:28,214
People dislike what
they do not understand.

1331
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,305
They dislike
what they envy.

1332
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:39,095
So sometimes you're just
gonna have to shrug and say,

1333
01:20:39,225 --> 01:20:41,924
"so be it."

1334
01:20:58,941 --> 01:20:59,811
Arrest record.

1335
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:01,030
Arrest record.

1336
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,683
Can we start
at the beginning ?

1337
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:03,946
Let US assume.

1338
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:06,600
Can you conceive
of a case wherein ?

1339
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:09,255
No, I'm not saying
in this case.

1340
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:12,345
I am saying let me
describe a case to you.

1341
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:13,781
And you tell me.

1342
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:15,174
You tell me,

1343
01:21:15,305 --> 01:21:17,263
is it conceivable
such a case would exist ?

1344
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:19,483
A man was persecuted
by his government.

1345
01:21:19,613 --> 01:21:21,093
Persecuted.

1346
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:22,051
Senor.

1347
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:23,269
Not my client.

1348
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,531
Not my client.

1349
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:25,968
Let US say someone.

1350
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:28,057
Some government.

1351
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:30,059
Some government.

1352
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:32,800
A man with
a grudge

1353
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:36,892
develops a vendetta
against a citizen.

1354
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:41,157
And that citizen,

1355
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:42,680
am I saying that
he's perfect, no.

1356
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:43,986
But I am saying.

1357
01:21:44,116 --> 01:21:47,815
The connection between
business, politics,

1358
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:51,123
and what we've come
to know as organized crime.

1359
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:52,168
My client.

1360
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:53,386
Mr. Senator,
my client--

1361
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:55,127
your client
has admitted.

1362
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:56,955
Admitted,
Mr. Polakoff,

1363
01:21:57,086 --> 01:21:58,174
knowing,

1364
01:21:58,304 --> 01:21:59,610
knowing and
consorting with.

1365
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,959
If you check
your records, sir,

1366
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,526
you will not find
the word admission

1367
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:04,006
as you call it,
of consorting with--

1368
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:06,486
and consorting
with frank costello.

1369
01:22:06,617 --> 01:22:09,968
Abnes willman,
Charles Luciano,

1370
01:22:10,099 --> 01:22:12,710
who seems he has just
returned from visiting with--

1371
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,973
you use the loaded word
consorting, senator.

1372
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:16,018
If I may
remind you...

1373
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:17,889
If you may.

1374
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,630
How, how, Mr. Polakoff,

1375
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,761
I ask you.

1376
01:22:20,892 --> 01:22:22,459
A respected
member of the bar.

1377
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:24,156
A light of
the legal profession.

1378
01:22:24,287 --> 01:22:25,853
I ask you.

1379
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:29,031
How can you,
and I will speak
of consorting,

1380
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:32,991
how can you consort
with men such as this ?

1381
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:35,820
To defend Luciano,
to defend--

1382
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,866
yes, sir, what word was it
you wanted to use, senator ?

1383
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,868
Undesirable.

1384
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:43,871
You know, senator,
you're undesirable.

1385
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:46,657
Your persons of,
if I may, low reputation,

1386
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:48,746
are just as entitled
to representation

1387
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:50,182
as any honorable person.

1388
01:22:50,313 --> 01:22:52,358
I don't have to
apologize to you, sir.

1389
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:53,446
You amaze me, sir !

1390
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:54,665
And you amaze me, sir.

1391
01:22:54,795 --> 01:22:55,927
Have you read
the constitution ?

1392
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:58,060
Gentlemen, gentlemen !

1393
01:23:02,499 --> 01:23:04,240
Drink ?

1394
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,764
No, thank you.

1395
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:08,592
You know, senator,
during the war, my client--

1396
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:10,550
I know all about what
you did in the war.

1397
01:23:10,681 --> 01:23:11,682
I know all about--

1398
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:12,726
can I ask you
something ?

1399
01:23:12,857 --> 01:23:13,814
Sure.

1400
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:15,903
What's so bad
about gambling ?

1401
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,557
You like to gamble

1402
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:19,777
like it quite a bit,
I'm told.

1403
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:21,605
Well, you know,

1404
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:24,303
I may like this and
I may like that.

1405
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:27,393
But I don't want you
people to control it.

1406
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,963
Well, maybe
you're confused.

1407
01:23:32,094 --> 01:23:37,316
Maybe you confuse me
with this or that Jew

1408
01:23:37,447 --> 01:23:39,275
who comes in here
and begs you to let him

1409
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:41,407
share the trough with you.

1410
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:43,670
Is that
the case ?

1411
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:48,110
I don't take
your meaning.

1412
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,635
Well, you said
"you people",

1413
01:23:51,765 --> 01:23:53,506
I assumed you
meant the Jews.

1414
01:23:53,637 --> 01:23:55,421
I did not
mean the Jews.

1415
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:58,381
I beg your pardon,
who did you mean then ?

1416
01:23:58,511 --> 01:24:00,687
I meant someone
as famous--

1417
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:02,515
I understand how
pleased you get,

1418
01:24:02,646 --> 01:24:05,301
someone to pick on, huh ?

1419
01:24:05,431 --> 01:24:07,085
Get the Jew.

1420
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:09,348
You're fooling
no one, mister.

1421
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:12,308
But you have chosen
the wrong man.

1422
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:15,180
Is that so ?

1423
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,356
Chosen the wrong man.

1424
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:20,577
What got your son
into west point ?

1425
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:26,278
No, I wouldn't,
get into that,

1426
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:28,498
in front of
the committee
if I were you.

1427
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:30,848
Don't tell me what is
and is not allowed.

1428
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:33,111
... and that gambling

1429
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:35,809
is the linchpin
of the organized crime

1430
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,376
of this country.

1431
01:24:37,507 --> 01:24:40,466
And that all their gambling
operations are controlled

1432
01:24:40,597 --> 01:24:43,426
by this man.

1433
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:45,863
That it is tied
to loan sharking,

1434
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:49,040
that it funds prostitution
and drugs.

1435
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,259
Senator, there's--

1436
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:51,564
if I may ?

1437
01:24:51,695 --> 01:24:54,654
And the subordination
of elected officials.

1438
01:24:54,785 --> 01:24:57,135
Now, Mr. Lansky,
for example,

1439
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:59,920
would you tell US
how in the world

1440
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:01,705
you have conn--

1441
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,931
How've you gotten your
son into west point ?

1442
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:13,456
Senator, I strongly object
to the introduction--

1443
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:15,849
would you share
with US

1444
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,852
the source of your
ability to manipulate...

1445
01:25:18,983 --> 01:25:21,159
To control.

1446
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:33,824
Hold's off.

1447
01:25:33,954 --> 01:25:35,304
How bad is that ?

1448
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:36,392
Two percent.

1449
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:37,741
Over what ?

1450
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:39,308
Over the last week.

1451
01:25:39,438 --> 01:25:41,658
And so we say
that's what ?

1452
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,094
What ?

1453
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:44,791
We would say that's
attributable to what ?

1454
01:25:44,922 --> 01:25:46,750
How you doing ?

1455
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,231
How am I doing ?

1456
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:52,059
I'm doing like the joint
is doing, jakelah.

1457
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,453
Hell of a thing.

1458
01:25:54,584 --> 01:25:57,717
United States of America
verses meyer lansky,

1459
01:25:57,848 --> 01:25:58,936
Jake lansky.

1460
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:00,764
You are hereby ordered
to appear

1461
01:26:00,894 --> 01:26:03,332
gambling, forgery,
conspiracy.

1462
01:26:03,462 --> 01:26:04,768
Operating...

1463
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:05,943
They got US down
for everything

1464
01:26:06,073 --> 01:26:07,249
except sinking
the normandy.

1465
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:09,294
Hell of a thing.

1466
01:26:09,425 --> 01:26:11,166
You know,
it's the...

1467
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:14,081
After all, it's
the goddamn predictability

1468
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:15,170
of the whole thing,
isn't it ?

1469
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,388
Meyer, meyer.

1470
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:51,641
Opinion on that
labor problem...

1471
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:53,120
I'm sure you're
doing fine.

1472
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:54,383
The other party--

1473
01:26:54,513 --> 01:26:56,994
no, no, no,
you handle it.

1474
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:04,131
A sheet of paper
and an envelope, please.

1475
01:27:05,002 --> 01:27:08,310
♪ I know him so

1476
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:28,504
Here you are,
Mr. Lansky.

1477
01:27:28,634 --> 01:27:31,768
Thank you.

1478
01:27:31,898 --> 01:27:32,899
Can I get you
anything else ?

1479
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,771
No, thanks.

1480
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:38,688
Oh, give me
a pen, will you ?

1481
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,256
Thanks.

1482
01:28:27,737 --> 01:28:30,479
Let me have a
glass of water, okay ?

1483
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:39,705
The captain
has advised me

1484
01:28:39,836 --> 01:28:41,577
we will be landing
in Panama City

1485
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:43,405
in approximately
twenty minutes.

1486
01:28:43,535 --> 01:28:44,841
Please have your
passports ready

1487
01:28:44,971 --> 01:28:46,930
and remain seated
until the aircraft

1488
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,453
has come to
a complete stop.

1489
01:28:51,238 --> 01:28:53,415
Worse comes to worse,
you stay down here.

1490
01:28:53,545 --> 01:28:54,677
It's hot.

1491
01:28:54,807 --> 01:28:56,156
It's not
hot in Miami.

1492
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:57,375
Well, the thing is,

1493
01:28:57,506 --> 01:28:59,246
what's it
gonna take ?

1494
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:02,902
You got a
spare million, meyer ?

1495
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:05,252
If I had 1/10th the money
they think I have.

1496
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:08,038
If I had 1/10th
the money I should,

1497
01:29:08,168 --> 01:29:10,693
they'd be rolling out
the red carpet.

1498
01:29:10,823 --> 01:29:11,781
You had to
spare a million--

1499
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:14,218
you want to sue
Castro for it ?

1500
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,438
You want to sue
Castro for my money ?

1501
01:29:18,309 --> 01:29:19,832
Lookit, lookit,

1502
01:29:19,963 --> 01:29:21,878
the feds have
the hots for you, meyer.

1503
01:29:22,008 --> 01:29:23,793
They aren't
going to go away.

1504
01:29:23,923 --> 01:29:25,490
You want to be
the old wolf,

1505
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:27,057
keep everyone at bay.

1506
01:29:27,187 --> 01:29:28,798
A person starts
to lose his step,

1507
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:30,539
it's human nature.

1508
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:32,802
You know,
I don't feel so good.

1509
01:29:33,933 --> 01:29:36,283
What can I do ?

1510
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:39,983
When we get down,
find a place, I'll lie down.

1511
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:43,682
Lie down,
lie down now.

1512
01:29:43,813 --> 01:29:46,163
He's not
feeling good.

1513
01:29:46,293 --> 01:29:48,339
You take
your pill ?

1514
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:50,385
It's okay,
it's okay.

1515
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:00,873
I'm in love.

1516
01:30:01,004 --> 01:30:02,222
Is that the thing ?

1517
01:30:04,616 --> 01:30:07,227
What happened to they're
all like row boats.

1518
01:30:07,358 --> 01:30:09,708
Turn 'em over,
they're all the same.

1519
01:30:09,839 --> 01:30:10,709
I'm in love.

1520
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,494
Oh, hell...

1521
01:30:12,624 --> 01:30:14,626
Hey, don't nudge me,
I'm doing it for you.

1522
01:30:14,757 --> 01:30:15,932
Am I doing
it for you ?

1523
01:30:16,062 --> 01:30:19,805
Who's my landsman ?

1524
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:20,850
What better way
to spend your time.

1525
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,417
I'm in love !

1526
01:30:29,162 --> 01:30:31,121
What about
Joey ?

1527
01:30:57,321 --> 01:30:59,454
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

1528
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:02,892
Who are you ?

1529
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:04,415
I'm a friend
of a friend

1530
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:06,809
who asked me to
see you about a matter

1531
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:11,074
which concerns him and
a certain young woman.

1532
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:15,774
Virginia hill.

1533
01:31:15,905 --> 01:31:17,297
That's not
necessary.

1534
01:31:17,428 --> 01:31:22,085
A certain past.

1535
01:31:22,215 --> 01:31:25,567
And my friend wants to know
your intentions towards her.

1536
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:29,658
I don't get you.

1537
01:31:29,788 --> 01:31:33,444
If you're intentions
are marriage,

1538
01:31:33,575 --> 01:31:35,751
my friend is going to
give you his blessings.

1539
01:31:36,882 --> 01:31:38,014
Marriage ?

1540
01:31:40,886 --> 01:31:42,932
Marriage ?

1541
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:48,241
If your intentions
are marriage,

1542
01:31:48,372 --> 01:31:51,506
he's going to give
you his good will.

1543
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:54,683
Look, I don't
want to...

1544
01:31:54,813 --> 01:31:56,293
Let's not
waste time.

1545
01:31:56,423 --> 01:31:58,904
We're very
busy men.

1546
01:31:59,035 --> 01:32:00,384
Get me a pipe with
a long enough stem and

1547
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,865
I'm gonna blow smoke
up my own ass.

1548
01:32:02,995 --> 01:32:05,345
But don't make
me sit here

1549
01:32:05,476 --> 01:32:08,435
and tell me
you don't know.

1550
01:32:09,828 --> 01:32:11,569
What don't
you know ?

1551
01:32:13,136 --> 01:32:15,442
My friend is a friend
to this person.

1552
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:19,534
You are going
to treat her right.

1553
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:24,321
Treat her right.

1554
01:32:27,106 --> 01:32:31,110
If your intentions
are otherwise,

1555
01:32:31,241 --> 01:32:34,679
I can't help you.

1556
01:32:40,816 --> 01:32:42,905
I'm just
a messenger.

1557
01:32:43,035 --> 01:32:45,777
You've had
the message.

1558
01:32:48,737 --> 01:32:50,086
I think
we're done here.

1559
01:33:03,316 --> 01:33:04,840
Nice looking woman.

1560
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,450
Not for you, pal.

1561
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,931
That's Virginia hill.

1562
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:12,325
I believe
she's spoken for.

1563
01:33:19,898 --> 01:33:21,639
Is that so ?

1564
01:33:28,298 --> 01:33:29,342
Switzerland.

1565
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:30,648
Every two weeks,
her vanity case.

1566
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:32,128
We don't even
know what's in it.

1567
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:34,391
Let's cut the
bullshit, meyer,

1568
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:36,001
what's in it
is money.

1569
01:33:36,132 --> 01:33:37,742
Where does the money
come from ?

1570
01:33:37,873 --> 01:33:39,265
The flamingo.

1571
01:33:39,396 --> 01:33:41,137
And our friend is
gone so off the deep end.

1572
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:43,313
Don't talk to me
about loyalty.

1573
01:33:43,443 --> 01:33:46,446
Because his
loyalty is...

1574
01:33:46,577 --> 01:33:49,841
What is he do with our 8 million
dollars for a 4 million dollar

1575
01:33:49,972 --> 01:33:52,409
hotel which at
that price is obscene ?

1576
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:54,933
And don't tell me statue
in the dessert, meyer..

1577
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:57,370
Because I know how
far you go back.

1578
01:33:57,501 --> 01:33:58,850
We go back...

1579
01:33:58,981 --> 01:34:02,071
We go back
to square one.

1580
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:03,594
What do we do if that
weren't the case, meyer ?

1581
01:34:03,725 --> 01:34:05,291
Would we be
having this meeting ?

1582
01:34:05,422 --> 01:34:06,336
Would we be having
this meeting ?

1583
01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:07,772
I don't think so.

1584
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:10,209
Meyer, can we get
a sense of this thing,

1585
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:12,037
can we
get a vote ?

1586
01:34:12,168 --> 01:34:14,387
I say we vote
right now.

1587
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:20,742
I'm sorry, meyer.

1588
01:34:27,923 --> 01:34:29,315
Vote.

1589
01:34:30,534 --> 01:34:33,102
Alright.

1590
01:34:33,232 --> 01:34:36,148
I'm going to ask for
a vote on this thing.

1591
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:00,607
On behalf of
the captain and crew,

1592
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:02,131
welcome to Panama.

1593
01:35:04,873 --> 01:35:06,004
I can get
that for you.

1594
01:35:06,135 --> 01:35:08,267
What am I,
an old man ?

1595
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:11,140
So, Panama.

1596
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,272
What's wrong
with that ?

1597
01:35:15,405 --> 01:35:17,363
A wandering Jew.

1598
01:35:17,494 --> 01:35:19,496
You know what my
father used to say ?

1599
01:35:19,626 --> 01:35:21,977
The hill people and
the valley people.

1600
01:35:22,107 --> 01:35:23,587
Hill people
and valley people

1601
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:24,719
always hated
each other.

1602
01:35:24,849 --> 01:35:25,894
The way of the world.

1603
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:27,765
We're the hill people.

1604
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:29,158
Is that
what we are ?

1605
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:30,550
That's right.

1606
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:32,030
Conditions
are tough.

1607
01:35:32,161 --> 01:35:33,771
Gotta find
an easy way.

1608
01:35:33,902 --> 01:35:35,381
Eh ?

1609
01:35:35,512 --> 01:35:36,731
Nomads.

1610
01:35:36,861 --> 01:35:38,384
Come down
to the valley.

1611
01:35:38,515 --> 01:35:41,257
What do these hill
people want with US ?

1612
01:35:41,387 --> 01:35:45,130
Home is the sailor,
home from the sea.

1613
01:35:45,261 --> 01:35:46,305
What's that ?

1614
01:35:46,436 --> 01:35:47,654

Oh, well, he left
everyone alone.

maybe bowie...

01:45:47,123 --> 01:45:53,347
Not the best bet
but the f-i-x sure thing.

1780

And costello would
call Walter winchell

1781
01:45:57,176 --> 01:45:58,743
winchell would give
it to hoover.

01:45:58,874 --> 01:46:01,093

bet a few hundred.

1783
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,793
I bet none of those commies
he was locking up

1784
01:46:04,923 --> 01:46:06,272
were giving him
sure things.

it cosa nostra.

Said that the FBI
uncovered it.

01:46:34,213 --> 01:46:35,867
But for
the longest time,

1794
01:46:35,998 --> 01:46:38,304
the FBI treated
you with...

1795
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:43,397
Perhaps hoover did
not think me worthy

1796
01:46:43,527 --> 01:46:45,311
of his notice.

1797
01:46:46,443 --> 01:46:48,837
Because you see,

1798
01:46:48,967 --> 01:46:51,274
because my role
in the whole thing

1799
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:55,017
has been magnified
out of all.

1800
01:46:55,147 --> 01:46:58,455
Because the time came
when it suited his purposes

1801
01:46:58,586 --> 01:47:01,197
and I'll tell you why.

1802
01:47:01,327 --> 01:47:02,198
Yes.

1803
01:47:02,328 --> 01:47:03,199
You know why ?

1804
01:47:03,329 --> 01:47:04,983
Because
I'm a Jew.

1805
01:47:08,465 --> 01:47:09,597
Hoover needed,

1806
01:47:09,727 --> 01:47:12,164
mind you, the man
died in '72.

1807
01:47:12,295 --> 01:47:15,646
All the charges against me
were dropped by 1976.

1808
01:47:18,997 --> 01:47:21,957
The man needed
someone non-Italian

1809
01:47:22,087 --> 01:47:24,481
if the mafia
didn't exist.

1810
01:47:25,308 --> 01:47:27,702
So they picked...

1811
01:47:27,832 --> 01:47:30,531
Look, I'm a gambler
nothing more.

1812
01:47:30,661 --> 01:47:31,967
That's what I am.

1813
01:47:32,097 --> 01:47:33,708
That's what
I always was.

1814
01:47:33,838 --> 01:47:35,536
Essentially
an odds maker

1815
01:47:35,666 --> 01:47:39,017
for a pastime that people
will do what you will.

1816
01:47:39,844 --> 01:47:41,367
Always engage in.

1817
01:47:42,499 --> 01:47:47,156
You said,
bigger than u.S. Steel.

1818
01:47:47,286 --> 01:47:48,287
We were
bigger than...

1819
01:47:48,418 --> 01:47:51,290
Let me tell
you something.

1820
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:53,641
People will
always gamble.

1821
01:47:53,771 --> 01:47:57,514
So, now you see
the governments.

1822
01:47:57,645 --> 01:47:58,907
Huh ?

1823
01:47:59,037 --> 01:48:00,865
The lottery.

1824
01:48:00,996 --> 01:48:03,389
The numbers pays off
six hundred-to-one.

1825
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,435
State lottery now.

1826
01:48:05,566 --> 01:48:07,263
Get into
the business.

1827
01:48:07,393 --> 01:48:10,788
Suddenly
"oh, gambling isn't so bad.

1828
01:48:12,181 --> 01:48:14,009
They pay five hundred to one.

1829
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:17,316
And I'll tell you,
by the turn of the century,

1830
01:48:17,447 --> 01:48:19,971
the government,
you watch,

1831
01:48:20,102 --> 01:48:23,409
you'll have to watch
because I won't be there.

1832
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:26,195
The government will be
running not only gambling,

1833
01:48:26,325 --> 01:48:30,982
gambling, prostitution,
drugs.

1834
01:48:33,289 --> 01:48:34,899
Why ?

1835
01:48:37,467 --> 01:48:39,295
Because that's
where the money is.

1836
01:48:40,862 --> 01:48:42,341
That's where
the money is.

1837
01:48:44,779 --> 01:48:46,302
Do you believe that ?

1838
01:48:46,432 --> 01:48:49,566
Sore throat,
chicken soup.

1839
01:48:55,006 --> 01:48:58,183
I'd like to talk to you
for a moment about violence.

1840
01:49:01,578 --> 01:49:03,972
You're a soldier,
you were in the wars.

1841
01:49:05,582 --> 01:49:07,497
Of course.

1842
01:49:07,628 --> 01:49:09,455
Do you talk
about it ?

1843
01:49:19,335 --> 01:49:22,251
The cossacks are coming.

1844
01:49:26,603 --> 01:49:27,778
You can run.

1845
01:49:27,909 --> 01:49:29,824
Maybe you
can get away.

1846
01:49:29,954 --> 01:49:30,955
You can hide.

1847
01:49:31,086 --> 01:49:32,391
Maybe they
won't find you.

1848
01:49:32,522 --> 01:49:33,436
You can fight.

1849
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:34,872
Maybe you'll win.

1850
01:49:35,003 --> 01:49:37,745
You do what you
have to do at the time.

1851
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:40,835
By the best lights
that you have.

1852
01:49:42,401 --> 01:49:45,187
And it's your
own personality.

1853
01:49:45,317 --> 01:49:47,319
Your own...

1854
01:49:49,104 --> 01:49:50,888
Character.

1855
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,719
You see, environment,
a little bit yes.

1856
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,155
But at an
early age.

1857
01:49:57,286 --> 01:50:02,421
An early age,
who you are is who you are.

1858
01:50:05,337 --> 01:50:06,643
And that's everyone.

1859
01:50:11,082 --> 01:50:12,997
You want some
more coffee ?

1860
01:50:26,271 --> 01:50:29,971
You know, you ask someone
who's in the jailhouse

1861
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:31,363
for his story,

1862
01:50:31,494 --> 01:50:33,844
you get the
jailhouse story.

1863
01:50:33,975 --> 01:50:37,239
Murray stole,
carmine stole,

1864
01:50:37,369 --> 01:50:39,371
but I never stole.

1865
01:50:39,502 --> 01:50:41,809
Bob killed
and Mikey killed,

1866
01:50:41,939 --> 01:50:44,289
but I never killed.

1867
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:47,031
It's the
jailhouse tale.

1868
01:50:50,121 --> 01:50:51,862
You ever worry ?

1869
01:50:51,993 --> 01:50:55,213
You show me somebody
who profited from it,

1870
01:50:55,344 --> 01:50:58,260
I'd be glad
to do it.

1871
01:50:58,390 --> 01:51:01,219
What would you do if you
could do it over again ?

1872
01:51:04,309 --> 01:51:05,310
What would you
do differently ?

1873
01:51:06,572 --> 01:51:08,226
What would I do ?

1874
01:51:08,357 --> 01:51:10,664
What would I do ?

1875
01:51:14,232 --> 01:51:15,669
What would I do
differently ?

1876
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:21,413
I wouldn't
change a thing.
