Look what they did to me!

30
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,064
- Why do you care - so much if I get along
- With Darla?

00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,024
- After this trip, - I'll never have

- Yes, if I can
- wait that long.

- The only man
- I've had in my life

192
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,843
Wait for it.

193
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,513
Not everyone could fail

194
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:46,597
so miserably at acting,

195
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,932
and still have

196
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,225
the courage to keep trying,

197
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,560
even though

198
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,562
she gets rejected over

199
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,562
and over and over.

200
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,772
And there it is.

201
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,838
Kind of like the way she was

202
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,110
rejected by all of

203
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,110
the boys in high school.

204
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,320
She was so unpopular

205
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,589
- that even the vending - machines rejected
- Her quarters.

206
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,469
Okay, all right.

207
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,325
Thank you, Darla.

208
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,410
That was fascinating.

209
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,475
Just like your

210
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,496
stories about collecting

211
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,496
barf bags at 30,000 feet.

212
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,166
And your "how

213
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,250
to-put-on-a-seatbelt"

214
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,250
speech

215
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,751
- is always a big hit
- at parties.

216
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,605
- And I know that
- whenever I need advice,

217
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,922
Jessie will always be there,

218
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,964
- because, Lord knows,
- she's never out on a date.

219
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,468
- Let's hear
- it for Darla Shannon.

220
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,075
If her name sounds familiar,

221
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:27,305
it's probably because

222
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,241
- you wrote a complaint - letter
to an airline - About her.

223
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,849
(BOTH LAUGHING)

224
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,729
(SCREAMING)

225
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,232
This is awesome!

226
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,858
This is fun!

227
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,381
This is going

228
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:42,861
to be the day I die!

229
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,865
And I was so looking

230
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,741
forward to puberty!

231
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,349
- You should've seen
- Darla's face in high school.

232
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,582
The moon had less craters.

233
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,811
- Then again,
- the moon didn't eat

234
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,920
- Four personal pan
- pizzas for lunch every day.

235
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,735
Okay, at least

236
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:03,299
I didn't have to eat

237
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,299
with the cafeteria lady.

238
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,529
Olga was a sparkling

239
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,717
conversationalist.

240
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,263
At least, I assume so.

241
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,680
I don't speak Russian.

242
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,516
Congratulations, Luke.

243
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,268
You have driven us

244
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,268
to the mess hall,

245
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,499
the one place

246
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,687
we are sure to get caught.

247
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,480
- That's where
- the rush comes in.

248
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,776
I'll just go in reverse.

249
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,193
It must be this "R" button.

250
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,653
(GUESTS SCREAM)

251
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,030
Incoming!

252
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,701
- (WHISPERS)
- You think anybody noticed?

253
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,038
Luke, did it ever occur

254
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,247
to you that

255
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,582
- "R" might stand
- for "rocket"?

256
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,174
I told you kids

257
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,717
never to set foot

258
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,717
in that thing again.

259
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,427
We can explain!

260
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,511
Ravi made us do it!

261
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,848
Okay, I can fix this.

262
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,413
All I need is a hammer,

263
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:57,477
a screwdriver,

264
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,477
and a time machine.

265
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,232
Dad, I can explain.

266
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,441
It was an accident.

267
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,360
You think maybe

268
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,795
- if you had been
- watching these kids

269
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,654
- Instead of trading
- insults with Darla,

270
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,573
- This accident would
- never have happened?

271
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,783
Okay, I got carried away.

272
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,285
That was a mistake.

273
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,621
But so is ambushing

274
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:15,913
your daughter with

275
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,913
a surprise wedding!

276
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,581
- PRESCOTT:
- I was afraid if I told you

277
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,979
I was marrying

278
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,334
Darla's mom over

279
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,334
the phone, you'd freak out!

280
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,919
- What do you think
- I'm doing now?

281
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,379
I came back here

282
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,796
to try and make things

283
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,796
right between us.

284
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,861
But instead I'm stuck

285
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:26,882
with a new family,

286
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,550
- and you didn't
- even ask me!

287
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,927
Why should I ask you?

288
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,095
You didn't ask

289
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,221
me when you ran off

290
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,221
to New York!

291
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,063
- Because I knew you wouldn't
- be supportive!

292
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,934
It's a lot easier

293
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,768
to be supportive when

294
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,768
somebody makes good decisions.

295
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,562
Leaving home

296
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:40,645
was a good decision.

297
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,398
- Mom always told me
- to follow my dreams.

298
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,875
- She'd be proud
- that I moved to New York.

299
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,213
Not if she saw

300
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:46,526
what a disaster

301
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,526
it's turned into.

302
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,009
Well, if that's how you feel,

303
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,530
then maybe I just should

304
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,530
just not come to your wedding.

305
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
If that's what you want.

306
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,183
It wouldn't be the first time

307
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,455
you went AWOL

308
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,455
from this family.

309
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,125
That's it.

310
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,547
Kids, we're going back

311
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:06,630
to New York, right now.

312
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,691
- They're going
- to tear us apart!

313
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,925
We have to run away!

314
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,196
- Okay, but I'm wearing - high heels,
so you might - Have to carry me.

315
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,346
Done.

316
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,504
- And I thought our private jet
- was a fun way to travel!

317
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,743
- Jump in. I'll drive us
- to the airport.

318
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,107
Get out of that vehicle!

319
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,463
Or you know what?

320
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:27,776
Don't. I don't care.

321
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,236
I'm done.

322
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,612
What do you mean?

323
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,591
- I mean you knew how important
- this weekend was to me,

324
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,284
But you obviously didn't care.

325
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,536
You deliberately disobeyed me,

326
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,871
over and over,

327
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:40,164
and I'm sick of it!

328
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,270
We promise it will

329
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,333
never happen again.

330
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,834
You're right, it won't.

331
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,315
And it's not

332
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,753
my problem anymore,

333
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,753
because I quit.

334
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,099
- I hope you two
- are satisfied.

335
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,934
Because of your malfeasance,

336
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,727
we are going to

337
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,727
lose Jessie!

338
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,606
Hey, her quitting

339
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:05,856
is your fault, too!

340
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:06,916
- You're the one
- who's supposed to stop us

341
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,733
- From doing
- stupid stuff like that.

342
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,611
Yeah, you're like our smaller,

343
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,446
more annoying Jiminy Cricket.

344
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,681
Jessie, you have

345
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,119
every right to be angry,

346
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,038
but please, do not quit.

347
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,269
Yeah, we're really,

348
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,916
really, really sorry.

349
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,377
- Sorry doesn't
- cut it this time.

350
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,379
- I promise, we've
- learned our lesson.

351
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,922
Good, then I hope

352
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,423
you'll be more respectful

353
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,423
to your next nanny.

354
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,509
We do not want another nanny!

355
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,593
We just want you.

356
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,513
- You're the best nanny
- in the whole wide world!

357
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,390
And Emma would agree,

358
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,662
if she had not run away

359
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:41,892
with Caleb when

360
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,892
you were not paying attention.

361
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,396
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me?

362
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,815
- After you quit,
- there was a power vacuum.

363
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,942
We did not know

364
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:51,026
who to report to.

365
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,529
Emma's not picking up.

366
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,613
How am I supposed

367
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,613
to find them?

368
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,740
- Well, I know where
- there is a computer

369
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,471
That can triangulate

370
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,160
her cell phone signal

371
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,160
and pinpoint her location.

372
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,620
Great, where is it?

373
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,747
In the B.A.T.

374
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,709
Of course it is.

375
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,649
Well, then I guess

376
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,712
we're taking that B.A.T.

377
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,527
Yes! I am so proud of you

378
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:13,757
right now.

379
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,821
Which will probably

380
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:15,842
never happen again,

381
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,842
so enjoy it.

382
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,721
Okay, everybody buckle up.

383
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,932
I hope this thing is fast.

384
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,121
There's a button marked "F."

385
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,268
Maybe that means fast.

386
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,268
Right there.

387
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,025
It means "fly"!

388
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,715
Or "fetal position,"

389
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,362
which I will now assume.

390
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,738
And I'm gonna assume

391
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:37,739
the whoo-hoo position.

392
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,699
Whoo-hoo!

393
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,661
I want one of these

394
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:43,703
for Christmas,

395
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,872
but pink and with streamers!

396
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,751
- I'm glad you guys
- are both having fun.

397
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,815
Meanwhile,

398
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:51,836
I think I just

399
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,836
got a bug in my teeth.

400
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,048
Although my vision

401
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,132
is blurred from fear,

402
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,176
I believe the computer

403
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,760
has located Emma's

404
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,760
cell signal!

405
00:11:58,802 --> 00:11:59,844
Great, where is she?

406
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,887
I have good news

407
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,888
and bad news.

408
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,181
What's the good news?

409
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,642
Emma appears

410
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:05,767
to be in a munitions bunker.

411
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,749
The munitions bunker

412
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,313
is where they keep all

413
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,313
of the deadly explosives!

414
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,981
And that was the bad news.

415
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,857
Way to steal my thunder.

416
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,406
(SIGHS)

417
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,721
Sorry, I couldn't find us

418
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:21,992
a more romantic place to hide.

419
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,328
- Any place with you
- is romantic.

420
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,808
I just won't be lighting

421
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:26,871
these candles I brought.

422
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,792
Oh, you look cold.

423
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,354
- Do you want my jacket
- or something?

424
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,840
LUKE: Sweet!

425
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:37,882
ZURI: Yeah!

426
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,759
RAVI: God protect us.

427
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,345
(THUDS)

428
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,805
Are we in heaven?

429
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,267
Am I playing washboard

430
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:48,686
for the late, great country

431
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:48,686
legend, Tammy Wynette?

432
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,936
Then no.

433
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,901
- Okay, I'll run in and grab
- Caleb and Emma.

434
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,655
You guys stay put.

435
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,492
And don't touch anything!

436
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,951
But I want a snow cone.

437
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,620
- It has a
- snow cone maker, too?

438
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,542
- No wonder you guys
- keep stealing this thing.

439
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,855
Jessie,

440
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,085
I am not going back

441
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,085
to New York.

442
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,379
Don't even bother to ask.

443
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,341
- Oh, I'm not asking.
- I'm grabbing and pulling.

444
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,717
You can't separate us!

445
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,359
- We're two souls
- that have become one.

446
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,553
- Your two souls - can video chat.
- We're leaving.

447
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,619
No! I'm staying here

448
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,350
with Caleb. I love him!

449
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,395
(ALARM BLARING)

450
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,915
- AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
- Munitions bunker in lockdown.

451
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,838
Emma, you just locked us

452
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,736
in a room packed

453
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,736
with deadly explosives!

454
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,028
As opposed to safe explosives?

455
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,958
- Sorry, I get sarcastic
- when I'm nervous.

456
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,469
- AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
- Munitions bunker in lockdown.

457
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,827
Cool!

458
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,473
- I know I should care - that
Jessie and Emma - Are trapped,

459
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,058
- But I'm all hopped up
- on snow cones!

460
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,668
- Want some? - Want some?
- Want some?

461
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,256
Emma, why did you do that?

462
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,758
You left me no choice.

463
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,842
No choice?

464
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:02,884
You didn't hear me mention

465
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,884
the video chat option?

466
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,739
- And you shouldn't have run
- away in the first place.

467
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,055
That never solves anything.

468
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,516
- Says the girl who's running
- away from her own

469
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,557
Father's wedding.

470
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,893
- (SCOFFS) That is
- completely different!

471
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,187
Somewhat different.

472
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,855
Okay, it's exactly the same.

473
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,171
But I'm running away

474
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:19,359
from the demon seed, Darla!

475
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,860
- No offense.
- None taken.

476
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,404
She used to hold

477
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:23,905
me down and make me

478
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,905
smell her armpit.

479
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,947
- That is a terrible thing
- to do to a little kid.

480
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,492
It was this morning.

481
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,268
So you're going to let Darla

482
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,790
make things worse between

483
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,790
you and your dad?

484
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,082
(SIGHS)

485
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,376
Look, it's not just Darla.

486
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,981
- I never thought my dad
- would get married again.

487
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,591
But he's fallen in love.

488
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,968
- Don't you want him
- to be happy?

489
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,928
Well, of course I do, but...

490
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,618
Everything

491
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:49,723
is happening so fast.

492
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,184
I don't want

493
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:53,435
my family to change.

494
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,895
You wouldn't understand.

495
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,941
Actually, I do understand.

496
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,490
When my parents adopted Luke,

497
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:07,157
then Zuri, then Ravi,

498
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,180
I was upset, because

499
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:10,744
I didn't want my family

500
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,744
to change.

501
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,038
But now I love them

502
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,205
more than anything.

503
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,541
Even Luke,

504
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:16,834
who's about as

505
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,834
demon seed as they come.

506
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,275
But my dad and I have been

507
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,505
through a lot together.

508
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,423
We've always been a team.

509
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,656
You can still be a team,

510
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,428
you're just adding

511
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,428
a few more players.

512
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,527
- Yeah, but I'm getting Darla
- on my team.

513
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,664
Well, I got a 7-foot

514
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,311
lizard with rat breath

515
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,311
and a scary, forked tongue.

516
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,897
Okay, it's a draw.

517
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,089
I guess my dad deserves

518
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,111
to start a new chapter

519
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,111
in his life.

520
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,552
Like I did when I moved

521
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:48,824
to New York and started taking

522
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,824
care of you guys.

523
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,743
Exactly, and look

524
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:52,202
how great that turned out.

525
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,745
It did, didn't it?

526
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,832
How did you get so smart?

527
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,500
I've had a great teacher.

528
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,007
Besides, I know

529
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,174
a lot about love.

530
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,674
- After all, - I've been in it
- For two whole days.

531
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,453
Just wait until you can

532
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:14,974
finally make a guy really care

533
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,974
about you, too.

534
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,562
Okay, moment over.

535
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,272
- But you're right.
- I should get to that wedding.

536
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,007
Except I can't,

537
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,738
because, thanks to you,

538
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,738
I'm locked in!

539
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,927
Maybe Luke, Ravi and Zuri

540
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,783
will try to blast us

541
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,783
out of here with the B.A.T.

542
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,327
(SCOFFS) We are in

543
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,828
a room full of explosives

544
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,723
- equipped with - a hair-trigger
- Self-destruct system

545
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:37,748
In case someone

546
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:38,749
tries to steal them.

547
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,501
Not even they

548
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,210
would be dumb

549
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,210
enough to fire on it.

550
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,839
Ready, aim, fire!

551
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,178
(LAUGHS)

552
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,765
Nimrods.

553
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,369
- (SIREN BLARING) - AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
- Munitions bunker under attack.

554
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,478
Activate self-destruct

sequence,

556
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,855
Well, that's not good.

557
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,942
ALL: Help! Let us out.

558
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,863
- I can't believe
- Jessie's really not coming.

559
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,240
Maybe I was too hard on her.

560
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,325
Aw, she wouldn't miss

561
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,367
your wedding.

562
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,070
- I know it.
- She'll be here.

563
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,871
I don't know.

564
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,640

- And I took away
- the keys to her tank.

567
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,296
have you seen Jessie?

568
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,069
No. With any luck,

575
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,036
- We're going
- to get blown to bits!

576
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,771
- And you're too pretty
- to be rubble!

577
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,855
I know!

- But thank you
- for disobeying me!

You're welcome.

591
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,055
