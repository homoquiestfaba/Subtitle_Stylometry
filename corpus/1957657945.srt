00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,770
[intense music playing]

2
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,296
[man] Okay, Cherry,
all cards are on the table.

3
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,198
We got a serious problem here.

4
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:10,834
Turning tricks is one thing,
but robbery that's a felony.

5
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,837
And robbery with a weapon,
that's robbery first degree.

6
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,040
You're looking at
five years minimum.

7
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,943
Come on, Captain.

8
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,178
You detectives
have been trying to pin

9
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:25,416
that robbery shit
on one of us girls for months.

10
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,985
It's bullshit and you know it.

11
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,300
Hands in the cage, animal.

12
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,813
Fuck! You don't
wanna fucking do this!

13
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,782
[muttering indistinct]

14
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,318
You're not gonna
fucking get away with this.

15
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,752
What the fuck did you just--

16
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,221
Shut the fuck up!

17
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,223
Night-night, bitch.

18
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,026
[indistinct]

19
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,161
Snake...

20
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,869
Wait for my signal, okay.

21
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:21,539
Stay in the cell.

22
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,008
- Wait till I get dressed.
- Right. Okay.

23
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,011
I know we got your DNA
all over that room.

24
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,983
I fucked that dude, I admit it.
I fucked that dude hard.

25
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:36,320
I'd be shocked if my DNA
wasn't in the room.

26
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:41,892
But DNA is not robbery,
you stupid damn motherfucker!
Asshole.

27
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,198
Be ready.

28
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,618
Come on, Cherry, help me out.

29
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:10,120
You help me and I'll help you.

30
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,427
No!

31
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:19,230
You know what?

32
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,431
I didn't rob anybody,

33
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:24,134
and I'm tired
of the goddamn scam.

34
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,870
You're charging me with felony,
I want a lawyer.

35
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,838
You want a lawyer?
I'll get you a lawyer.

36
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:32,977
But in the meantime,
you're gonna hang out
with the boys down in holding.

37
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,980
Fuck you.

38
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,550
- Can I help you officer?
- [gasps]

39
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,051
- Whoa.
- Surprise.

40
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:44,555
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Surprise, surprise.

41
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:48,259
- Don't fucking move.
- All right, just-just relax.

42
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,893
Now you in my jail now.

43
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:51,761
Okay, just tell me
what you need.

44
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:53,464
Just settle down and relax.
Tell me what you need.

45
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,766
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shut the fuck up, you're next.

46
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:00,070
And you do
exactly as I tell you.

47
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:02,805
Okay, all right,
just-just relax.

48
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,211
Take the handcuffs out
and cuff yourself.

49
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,980
Okay. Okay.

50
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,316
Take 'em out and put them on.

51
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,051
All right, all right.

52
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,954
- All right, all right.
- From behind, asshole.

53
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,791
Look, all right,
all right, all right.

54
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,094
I ain't playin'
with you, man.

55
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,964
Okay, all right, I'm cuffed.

56
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,934
All right, I'm cuffed.

57
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:33,537
- Nice try, motherfucker.
- [cuffs tighten]

58
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,774
Now get the fuck up.

59
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,510
Okay, all right, all right,
just-just settle down.

60
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,045
- [Cherry gasps]
- [mutters]

61
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,880
Don't you fucking move.

62
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,482
- Shut it.
- All right.

63
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:50,220
- Is it true?
- No.

64
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,492
- [gunshot]
- Everybody down!

65
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:02,066
Go, Raj, get 'em!
Grab the weapons.

66
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,367
[Raj] Sit down, come here.

67
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,203
[Snake indistinct]

68
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,106
Don't do something stupid, pops!

69
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,175
[Snake] Your fucking move now.

70
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,677
Don't look at me!

71
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:15,179
Get 'em cuffed,
get 'em cuffed.

72
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,716
Let's go, let's go!
We ain't got much time!

73
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,318
- Hurry up.
- No heroes today, pops.

74
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,886
Handcuff that asshole.

75
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,358
You guys like this, huh?

76
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,592
You like seeing
your captain like this?

77
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,294
Move.

78
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,763
Don't give me a fucking reason,
sit down.

79
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,498
Put a fucking cuff on.

80
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,501
Put it on!

81
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,347
[Snake laughing]

82
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,655
[Raj] Do her, man.

83
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,761
[soft chuckle]

84
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,463
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

85
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,170
[Raj] Now what, man?

86
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,306
Now...

87
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:22,379
Now we wait.

88
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:31,789
Shit...

89
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,091
Shit... [mutters]
Shit!

90
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,194
Fuck.
[screams]

91
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:40,664
[suspenseful music playing]

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,435
Patch me through.

93
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,069
Right away.

94
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,619
[phone ringing]

95
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:17,067
- What?
- This is FBI Special Agent
Roger Kinkaid.

96
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,402
Who am I speaking to?

97
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:20,137
This is McMasters,

98
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,875
and I have the captain
and a few other pigs in here.

99
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,878
Okay, Mr. McMasters.

100
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,479
What do you want from us?

101
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,814
I don't know.

102
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,983
Let me get back
to you about that.

103
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,489
Shit.

104
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,325
What do we do now?

105
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:44,194
There's nothing we can do
until he calls back.

106
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,070
[sighs]

107
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:04,281
[suspenseful music playing]

108
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,951
[Kinkaid] Okay, what do
we know about these three men?

109
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:11,288
Okay, Frank Williamson
a.k.a. Snake,

110
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:16,426
he is a convicted rapist,
gun and drug smuggler.

111
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,395
He's been arrested
multiple times

112
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,498
and his attorney always
finds a way to get him off.

113
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,668
Rajesh Carnak,

114
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:28,672
a.k.a. the Midnight Strangler,
the famous serial killer.

115
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,208
- He's the one responsible--
- Okay, okay.

116
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,677
I'm very familiar
with this case.
Let's move on.

117
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,346
Mike McMasters.

118
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,516
Paranoid schizophrenic
and the leader of this group.

119
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,087
He was arrested for homicide
and got off scot-free.

120
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,324
Apparently there wasn't
enough evidence to convict him.

121
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,160
The three have a long history.

122
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,262
They've known each other
for years.

123
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,498
They've been
incarcerated together

124
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:57,234
and wanted to form
some sort of alliance

125
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:59,803
to bring terror
to small communities,

126
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,874
eventually working their way
up to larger cities.

127
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:04,976
Thank God they
didn't get to do that.

128
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,178
Yes, but look what happened now.

129
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:13,717
A rapist, a serial killer
and a paranoid schizophrenic
holding hostages.

130
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,421
What a fucking mess.

131
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,969
- [coughing]
- Hey.

132
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:33,103
Look what I found.

133
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:38,475
Hey, can we keep her?

134
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,146
- Better yet, can I have her?
- [shudders]

135
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,148
She's all yours.

136
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,351
- You can't do that!
- Shut the fuck up!

137
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:51,154
- Sit your ass down.
- Hey, I found her, she's mine.

138
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,224
He said I could have her,
dammit, not you.

139
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:56,995
Fuck, chicken head.
I fucking found her.

140
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,997
- I'm taking her.
- That's enough!

141
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,033
[whimpering]
Officer, it's scary.

142
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,734
He looks so evil.

143
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,803
I know one minute you're mean,
the next minute

144
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:09,172
you're a good, good cop.

145
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,476
I'm in good hands, right?
You won't hurt me.

146
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:13,978
Will you take her over there?

147
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,014
We'll figure out
what we're gonna
do with her later on.

148
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,016
- Get over there.
- Don't hurt me.

149
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,349
[grunts]

150
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:22,386
I know what I'm gonna
do with her later on.

151
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,255
- You ain't doing shit.
- [laughing]

152
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,591
Thank God she's mine, man.

153
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,226
Are you okay?

154
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:32,162
- [breathes heavily]
- He's not a cop.

155
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,931
[McMasters]
Knock off the chit chat.

156
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,638
Thanks.

157
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:49,881
[suspenseful music playing]

158
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,633
McMasters, right?

159
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,538
Look, uh, you can still
get out of this.

160
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,240
All you gotta do
is let us all go.

161
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,609
I mean, I'll put in a good word
for you and the others.

162
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:23,047
Look, I'll tell the FBI
you didn't hurt me
or any of my guys.

163
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,749
- They'll just think--
- [Cherry yells]

164
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,783
Hey!

165
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,022
[groans]

166
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,389
[man] Oh, no, no.

167
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,326
Don't worry, sweetheart.
He's only sleeping.

168
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,295
- He needs a doctor.
- Get her ass down.

169
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:39,663
You bastard!

170
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,602
- What do we do now?
- We got in this together,

171
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,405
we'll get out of it.
We got this.

172
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:51,475
Maybe we could use these pigs
as bargaining chips, huh?

173
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:52,843
What do you think they're worth?

174
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:57,347
- A million dollars?
- A million dollars each?

175
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,382
They ain't worth
a hundred grand.

176
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,853
Get the fuck out of my face.

177
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,755
[Snake] Look, man,
it's a million dollars.

178
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:07,491
That's what they're worth,
that's what we're gonna get.

179
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:10,061
- We gotta lock this place down.
- Go get it done, it's your job.

180
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,695
I got it.

181
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,530
What are we gonna do
with that bitch?

182
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,532
Officer...

183
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,568
I'm sure you make
a lot of money.

184
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,570
I have a daughter, she needs me.

185
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:23,807
I'm not that bright
so I'm useless here, can I go?

186
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,011
We're gonna have
a lot of fun with her.

187
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,081
Later.

188
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,748
Much later.

189
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:33,316
No, I'm useless.

190
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,989
You listen and sit
your fucking ass down.

191
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,723
Now!

192
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,825
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:49,100
[sobbing]

194
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,871
[dramatic music playing]

196
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,783
I'm gonna call.

197
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,691
[phone ringing]

198
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,426
Yes?

199
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,397
McMasters, it's Roger Kinkaid.

200
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:22,967
<i>Ready to talk now?</i>

201
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,635
Sure.

202
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:29,106
But first,
is there anybody hurt in there?

203
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,242
Anybody need medical attention?

204
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,509
<i>Everybody's fine.</i>

205
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:36,746
- For now.
- <i>Okay.</i>

206
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:41,285
So what exactly
do you want from us?

207
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:47,457
Well, for starters
I want four million apiece.

208
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,793
<i>A million for each pig here.</i>

209
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:52,829
And for the captain,

210
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:59,603
I want a chopper, a pilot
and a full tank of gas.

211
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:05,642
And the bitch,
you can have her for free.

212
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:06,944
Got this?

213
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:09,613
<i>Consider it a gift</i>

214
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:11,883
<i>from me to you</i>

215
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,683
<i>since I'm so polite.</i>

216
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
What girl?

217
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,890
Well, well, well.

218
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:23,393
For someone who works in
the intelligence field,

219
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,096
you sure don't have much,
do you?

220
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:28,032
[laughing]

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,137
She's nothing, she's a whore.

222
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,572
We found her.

223
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,909
<i>That's why you get it for free.</i>

224
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:43,347
McMasters, you gotta realize
that we can't get $4 million
that quickly.

225
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:45,715
Listen to me, you fuck!

226
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,550
I'm the one in charge here!

227
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,388
<i>Do you get this?</i>

228
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,257
And if I don't have
these demands,

229
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,328
I will start
killing these people
one by one every hour.

230
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,561
You got that, amigo?

231
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:01,631
<i>And as for the bitch,</i>

232
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,368
we will fuck her,
we will gut her,

233
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:07,071
and we will kill her,
and fuck her again!

234
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,673
Not in that particular order.

235
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,708
I think you get the point.

236
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,011
You have one hour.

237
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:18,481
Fuck.

238
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,418
Fuck!

239
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,521
[groaning]

240
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:28,825
[breathing deeply]

241
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,295
Where did this girl come from?

242
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:33,097
I don't know.

243
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,341
The problem
with a paranoid schizophrenic

244
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,910
is we never know
who we're actually talking to.

245
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,312
What are you doing here,
Rodriguez?

246
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,647
- Move.
- By whose authority?

247
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,183
I'm in charge now.

248
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,956
[phone ringing]

249
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:04,095
McMasters, this is Rodriguez.

250
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:05,595
Who's this?

251
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,599
Put Kinkaid on the line.

252
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:13,337
McMasters, this is Rodriguez
and I'm in charge now.

253
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,839
Listen, I'm in charge!

254
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:19,276
Listen, McMasters,
I'm not here to play your games.

255
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,146
Put Captain Davis
on the phone now.

256
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,981
Oh-- Oh, yeah?

257
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,055
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

258
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,089
[officer] <i>Fuck!</i>

259
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:33,590
You-- fuck you!

260
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:35,993
Calm your ass!
Calm the fuck down!

261
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:37,895
What have you done?

262
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:42,766
Did you see what you made me do?

263
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,702
That one's on you.

264
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,205
Put Kinkaid on the line now.

265
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,739
I'm here.

266
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,879
Kinkaid, I want my money.

267
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:56,247
You got an hour.

268
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,786
You SWAT guys,

269
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:06,057
you're a hammer,
but not every problem is a nail.

270
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,925
You did this.

271
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,931
Oh, my God.

272
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,866
[McMasters]
Get her out of here.

273
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,642
[sobbing]

274
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:28,112
You bastard asshole!

275
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,759
[whimpering]

276
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:48,598
No! You bastard!
[sobbing]

277
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:56,806
We know all about Captain Davis,
but what do we
know about the hooker?

278
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,741
We don't know anything
about the hooker.

279
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:02,012
Honestly, McMasters
is our problem.

280
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:05,416
Look, it may not be
in his file,

281
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,585
but he claimed
during his last trial

282
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:10,753
that he blacks out
before he kills.

283
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:13,623
He killed six members
of the Stephenson family,

284
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,393
and then he said
he didn't remember any of it.

285
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:19,897
He's a killer.
They all have their story.

286
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,401
Cindy Stephenson,
the only survivor,

287
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:26,437
watched him kill
her entire family

288
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,441
and he was armed
only with his fist
while reciting Psalms Ten.

289
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:33,077
Psalms 10?

290
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,146
What the hell
does that have to do with it?

291
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,216
It's some Psalm
revolving around evil
against God and such.

292
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,152
Some weird shit.

293
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,623
She also said
that he appeared to be dreaming

294
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:48,092
in some sort of trance,

295
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,195
so much that he
couldn't even see her.

296
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,301
Kinkaid... trust me...

297
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,871
McMasters is our problem.

298
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,990
- Chow time, huh?
- Hell yeah.

299
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:23,693
- You guys feel like pizza?
- Yeah, that sounds good to me.

300
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,932
Yeah, me too.

301
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:29,466
You know, I was thinking...

302
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,206
wasn't this your girlfriend's?

303
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:38,741
[chuckles]

304
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:51,322
[phone ringing]

305
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,294
Kinkaid.

306
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,297
We're ready for lunch now.

307
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,966
McMasters...

308
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,101
Uh, we have sandwiches.

309
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,437
We'll send in some sandwiches,
how's that?

310
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,206
No, we'll take pizza, pepperoni.

311
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,611
No, you can't just call us
and order pizza like that.

312
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:16,947
Listen,
I'm in charge here, okay?

313
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:18,649
And we'll take pizza.

314
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:20,317
<i>No, no, I'm not doing this.</i>

315
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:23,554
We'll send you in
the same sandwiches
that we have.

316
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:25,122
<i>That's it.</i>

317
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:28,758
Guys...

318
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:41,105
[screaming]

319
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,744
Tell 'em.
Tell, 'em, tell 'em!

320
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,679
You tell 'em
and they'll feed us.

321
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:50,581
Yeah.

322
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:51,649
Yeah.

323
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,783
- [screaming]
- [Kinkaid] Okay.

324
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,719
What? I can't hear you.

325
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:58,355
- Okay, okay, stop.
- We're getting our pizza?

326
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:00,090
We'll get you your damn pizza.

327
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:01,892
Get this bitch out of my face!

328
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:04,428
Take her out of here!

329
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:09,166
Kinkaid, you need to start
listening to what I say!

330
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,770
Do everything I say,
whatever I want,

331
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:15,773
you give it to me, motherfucker!
You hear me?!

332
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:18,442
<i>Or I'll fucking kill everybody!</i>

333
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:20,711
We will all die!

334
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,479
- Fuck you!
- [phone slams]

335
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,486
Fuck!

336
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,289
Fuck!

337
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:37,161
Fuck you!

338
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:53,610
John, yeah, Kinkaid.

339
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,646
Yeah, right.

340
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,981
Listen, I need a favor.

341
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:00,184
You gotta get us some pizzas.

342
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:02,686
No, no, no, no.

343
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,023
Just the-the real delivery boy.

344
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,258
No, we'll take
responsibility for him.

345
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:12,062
Pizzas and the delivery boy,
understand?

346
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:14,865
No-- no, wire,
no camera, nothing.

347
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:21,438
Right. All right.
We're waiting.

348
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:35,285
So where do you guys
wanna start from now?

349
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,955
I've been reading up
on McMasters' file,

350
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:40,457
and he fancies himself
a lady's man.

351
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:42,493
So I'm gonna give him
a chance to be one.

352
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:45,295
So what are you gonna do,
flirt with him?

353
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:50,100
Oh, this will be the first
flirtatious negotiation

354
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:52,403
I've had the pleasure
of ever experiencing.

355
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:57,107
No, I'm gonna play to his ego
and find out
what started this shit.

356
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:59,543
[chuckles]
Well, let me ask you this.

357
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:01,912
Do you need a moment
to put on your make up?

358
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:04,081
What is that
supposed to mean?

359
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:06,550
[Kinkaid] Whoa, hang on.

360
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,786
We got a real problem here.
We gotta act quickly.

361
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,157
Did you know that McMasters
is a paranoid schizophrenic

362
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,426
and is normally under
heavy medication?

363
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:17,327
I read something
about that in his file.

364
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,264
And claustrophobia
is part of his pathology.

365
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:23,834
No. No, I didn't know that.
What's your point?

366
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:27,872
His murder revolves around
his schizophrenia

367
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:30,307
and it's triggered by
enclosed spaces.

368
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,278
Okay, the bullpen
is larger than his cell.

369
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:39,116
My point is that
when he's in his cell,
he's getting daily medication.

370
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:41,985
Son of a bitch.

371
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,720
We are well past that now.

372
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:45,956
He could explode at any moment.

373
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,304
Look what I found.

374
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:02,172
[McMasters]
Fucking food, finally.

375
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,909
Put that pizza there
right there.

376
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:07,044
Check his ass for wires.

377
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:10,013
Put your hands up.

378
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,318
Turn around.

379
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,324
Okay, he's clean.

380
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,497
You're kind of cute, huh?
Think I might wanna keep you
to play with you for a while.

381
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,131
Hey, Raj, check him out.

382
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:30,969
Yeah, nothing to check out.

383
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,669
Not my style.

384
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:33,972
- [chuckles]
- Hey, you got me.

385
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:36,773
- Leave him alone.
- Shut the fuck up and sit down.

386
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:38,375
Knock it off.

387
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,447
Pizza boy...

388
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:46,650
I got a message for you.

389
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:54,191
It's for Roger Kinkaid,
the FBI agent
in charge out there.

390
00:27:54,224 --> 00:27:59,196
You tell him
Mike McMasters says hello.

391
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:05,469
And that I'm right here
whenever he wants to see me.

392
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,874
And you let him know

393
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:14,144
that his captain and all
his fellow officers are okay.

394
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:16,580
Everyone's fine.

395
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,783
And remind him
about the money he owes me.

396
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,387
Can you do that for me?

397
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:33,597
Don't fuck up.

398
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,735
Now if I were you,
I'd pick that up.

399
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,806
Get the fuck out of here.

400
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,455
[shirt rips]

401
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:02,292
[groans]

402
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,928
It's a shame your lady

403
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:05,696
isn't gonna get down
on this pizza.

404
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:06,763
You hungry?

405
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:09,934
You okay?

406
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:11,735
- Hey, you okay?
- [groans]

407
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:13,670
[coughs]

408
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:30,487
You, my friend...
[mutters indistinct]

409
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:35,525
Where's Falcon?

410
00:29:36,894 --> 00:29:38,295
Where's Falcon?!

411
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,531
They-they killed her, Captain.

412
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:44,668
- What?
- They fucking killed her!

413
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,303
[groans]

414
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:48,906
Fuck you!

415
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,075
Go and shoot me!
Fucking shoot me!

416
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:53,111
No, you-you bastards.

417
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:55,113
You fucking bastards!

418
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:57,848
You fucking mother
son of a bitch,

419
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,183
McMasters, you're gonna fry!

420
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,718
You are so gonna fucking fry,

421
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,154
and I'm gonna put the needle
in your arm my fucking self!

422
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,790
Or I'll fucking kill you myself
right fucking now,

423
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:08,126
you fucking asshole!

424
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:10,827
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you! Fuck--

425
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,331
- Fuck you!
- [Cherry groans]

426
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:17,834
Shut the fuck up!
I will fucking kill you!

427
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:19,770
If I just wanna kill anybody,
I'm gonna kill you!

428
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:22,372
You got that?
You fucking piece of shit!

429
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:25,409
- Fuck you!
- No, please, no!

430
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:26,543
Sit down.

431
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:34,384
- No.
- What's your problem?

432
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:39,857
You think...
You think I'm afraid of you?

433
00:30:39,891 --> 00:30:44,461
No. You're a bastard,
but I lived with one.

434
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:48,432
Yeah? What was he like?

435
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,468
My daughter's father.

436
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:54,571
[soft chuckle]
I thought I married a good man

437
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,975
and we were gonna live
happily after.

438
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:03,981
But, you know, he's like you,
lunatic motherfucker
serial killer.

439
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:08,385
- Yeah.
- You know, he turned on me.

440
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:12,990
- Good.
- Just when my daughter
turned one year old.

441
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:17,360
That night he--
I never seen that face.

442
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,600
One hand had gun,
the other hand he had a scissor.

443
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:27,504
And he pointed at me,
asked me to choose.

444
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:33,543
You know, you kill me
or kill my daughter.

445
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,980
What'd you choose?

446
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,918
Come on, what you choose?

447
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:43,487
I couldn't, I wouldn't.

448
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,224
He's a bastard.

449
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:49,326
I got lucky
but it was a nightmare.

450
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:54,232
You know why I like him?

451
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:56,134
He's passionate.

452
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,936
Turns me on just like you.

453
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,403
Just like me, huh?

454
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,778
You're just a fucking whore.

455
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:10,480
Only a whore.

456
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:12,449
You know what
happened to him?

457
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:15,318
What? What happened?

458
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:20,490
He got crushed by a car,
terrible accident.

459
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:23,227
You know,
life's a bitch, right?

460
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:24,896
[chuckles]
Huh?

461
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:28,933
- Yeah, it is.
- Hey.

462
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:31,235
- Hey.
- What, what?

463
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:34,939
If I fuck you,
you're not gonna hurt me, right?

464
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:37,074
If I fuck you, no?

465
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:40,278
- No.
- No.

466
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,612
- No, great.
- I won't hurt you.

467
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:45,849
I'll fuck you.

468
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,789
If I fuck you...

469
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:58,095
I will have no choice
but to hurt you.

470
00:32:58,129 --> 00:32:59,663
Do you understand?

471
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:02,967
- I'll fuck you good.
- Yes.

472
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,036
- Yes.
- Yeah.

473
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:10,540
We're good, right?

474
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:13,144
Yeah.

475
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:15,112
Yeah, you can have some pizza.

476
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:48,913
Kinkaid,
your time's running out.

477
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,480
You have my demands?

478
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:52,016
[Kinkaid over phone]
<i>We have the money,</i>

479
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,851
<i>but you're gonna</i>
<i>have to wait five minutes.</i>

480
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:57,188
I want everything,

481
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:59,957
and if I don't get it
in five minutes,

482
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:02,492
another one
of your people's gonna die.

483
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:12,003
[exhales]

484
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,137
[Cortez] Hey.

485
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:15,873
Hey.

486
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,809
Why don't you let us go?

487
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,713
Please, please.

488
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:26,984
I've tortured and killed
a lot of people in my life,

489
00:34:27,018 --> 00:34:31,688
especially liked killing
those young sorority girls.

490
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:34,557
And I've always
wanted to kill a cop.

491
00:34:36,227 --> 00:34:39,397
Not a fast death,
you understand?

492
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,767
A slow, agonizing death.

493
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,071
One to remember, huh?

494
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:52,176
I wanna feel your pain
for the rest of my life.

495
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,810
[chuckles]

496
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:01,851
Maybe if you entertain me,
I'll just permanently
disable you, huh?

497
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,029
That's it, decided.

498
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:15,465
You two will be my first cops.

499
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:20,537
It's gonna be a fuckin' miracle.

500
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,940
It's gonna be great!

501
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:25,675
I can't wait.

502
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,346
Hey, hey, come on, man.

503
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,714
Quit fucking around.

504
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:33,117
Even you don't
wanna kill two cops.

505
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:35,819
That's insane.

506
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,690
- Come on, stop.
- Cortez, stop.

507
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,060
- He ain't screwing around.
- Of course he is,

508
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:47,365
- he's just trying--
- Listen to your friend, bitch!

509
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:51,869
This ain't no goddamn game...
we're playing.

510
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,547
What the hell just happened?

511
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,584
- God. Shut the fuck up.
- No.

512
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:09,053
He's gonna come back here,

513
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,889
he's gonna torture us
and then he's gonna kill us.

514
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:14,058
- Do you get the picture?
- No, no. He's not-- He's not--

515
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,259
He doesn't wanna--

516
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,930
- [guys muttering indistinct]
- Get this whiney bitch out of
here now.

517
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,798
[stammers]

518
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:25,702
No, no, Osborn, Osborn!
Stop, please!

519
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:27,537
- [kicks drawer]
- McMasters...

520
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:31,708
If you kill--
If you kill another cop...

521
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:35,446
they're not gonna
give you anything. Nothing.

522
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,714
Davis! Whitney!

523
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:39,383
They're gonna fuck you up!

524
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:41,751
[yells] Fucking psycho!

525
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,120
Yeah?

526
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:45,056
But you know what
they're gonna give you?

527
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,493
[groans]
You're a fucking psycho!

528
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:51,195
[groaning]

529
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,732
Captain John Davis,

530
00:36:55,765 --> 00:37:00,104
we award you
with the badge of disgrace

531
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:04,508
'cause you couldn't
keep your family alive
when they needed you most!

532
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,310
[Cherry] Shut the fuck up!

533
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:08,212
You're a stupid motherfucker

534
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:13,884
lunatic psychopath racist
white trash asshole!

535
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:15,019
That's you.

536
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:19,589
Shut the fuck up,
before I fuck you and kill you.

537
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:22,393
No, you will not
because I fuck good.

538
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:24,028
You will not kill me,
I fuck good.

539
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,662
You will not kill me,
you know that?

540
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:27,465
Ehh. Fuck you.

541
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:30,534
- [moaning]
- Fucking asshole. Come fuck me.

542
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:32,436
Come fuck me, you motherfucking.

543
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,138
- Fuck you, asshole.
- Fuck you, bitch.

544
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:38,242
Fuck me, come.
Come here. Fucking asshole.

545
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:40,377
Come, come, come, come.

546
00:37:58,429 --> 00:37:59,964
[Cortez groans]

547
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:38,002
[dramatic music playing]

548
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,866
You two stay here.

549
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:11,268
I got some business
to take care of with this bitch.

550
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:16,040
Not you, bitch.

551
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:18,808
You.

552
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:30,254
[suspenseful music playing]

553
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:45,903
- Hey, promise me one thing.
- Whatever you want.

554
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:48,838
I'll only fuck you,
not the other guys, okay?

555
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:50,908
Whatever you say.

556
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:55,980
Pick me up.

557
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:04,855
McMasters...
[muttering indistinct]

558
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,823
Slow, slow, slow.

559
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:10,361
Slow down. I'm yours.

560
00:40:10,394 --> 00:40:12,196
You're in charge.

561
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:17,368
I'm only yours. Shh.

562
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:20,137
I fuck good.
Fuck me.

563
00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:29,846
- [McMasters and Cherry moaning]
- [chair creaking]

564
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:33,284
Yes, sir.

565
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:42,393
Man, I'm getting a piece
of that ass if it kills me.

566
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,297
He might kill you, too.

567
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,332
You think
that damn freak McMasters

568
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,501
is gonna share
his piece of ass with you?

569
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,436
Who's fucking you?

570
00:40:55,572 --> 00:40:57,608
I fuck good,
I'm your fucking bitch!

571
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,476
- [grunts]
- [screams] Fuck!

572
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,212
You asshole!
[screams]

573
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:08,886
You dumbasses.

574
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:11,455
McMasters doesn't
give a shit about you.

575
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:17,761
He's like my brother.
I know he's gonna share with me.

576
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:19,829
Not a chance, dude.

577
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:23,133
No man shares his spoils.
No man.

578
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:26,870
That damn whore
is playin' hard, he's hers.

579
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,572
Listen to that shit.

580
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:30,374
Slow down, slick.

581
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,444
Take your time, McMasters.

582
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:36,880
You can fuck me as long
as you want any time you want.

583
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,184
But promise,
promise I only fuck you.

584
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:42,753
- Not the other guys, promise.
- Fuck me.

585
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:45,189
- Promise you, asshole, promise.
- I promise!

586
00:41:45,222 --> 00:41:47,124
[both grunting]

587
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:55,866
You ain't heard nothing yet.
Wait till I'm up in there.

588
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:57,334
[chuckles]

589
00:41:57,368 --> 00:41:58,969
Yeah, right.

590
00:42:03,707 --> 00:42:06,343
- [screams]
- [grunting]

591
00:42:08,112 --> 00:42:10,881
Fuck you, motherfucker.

592
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:19,858
[whispers] Oh, yeah.

593
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,993
- Fuck.
- You're my bitch.

594
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:25,829
I'm your fucking bitch.
[sobbing]

595
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,564
But not others, okay?

596
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:30,401
No... [indistinct]

597
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:31,870
I wanna please only you.

598
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:34,905
Yeah... come on.

599
00:42:35,706 --> 00:42:37,241
I fuck good, right?

600
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:38,308
You fuck good.

601
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,394
What?

602
00:42:58,429 --> 00:42:59,663
[Snake] Nothing.

603
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:03,534
You have something to do, right?

604
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:05,969
Yeah, man.

605
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:13,944
Do it.

606
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:27,224
Got lip--
My lipstick's all over you.

607
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:28,525
[chuckles]

608
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:43,974
Why don't you go ahead
and have a seat?

609
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,217
Who are you
pointing that gun at?

610
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:18,509
[suspenseful music playing]

611
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:18,235
McMasters.

612
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:21,071
McMasters, get up!

613
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:25,542
Hey.

614
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:31,448
Where is our money?

615
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:32,583
You--

616
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,053
What'd you
just say to me, man?

617
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:36,787
Take it easy, man.

618
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,322
[Raj] Calm down.

619
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:40,824
Take it easy.

620
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:42,526
Easy, man.

621
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:50,467
No reason to worry.

622
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,869
What happened?

623
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:03,948
It's okay, man, don't worry.
Just calm down.

624
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,415
No reason to worry.

625
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:09,887
Huh?

626
00:46:51,095 --> 00:46:53,563
[shuddering breathing]

627
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,722
[phone ringing]

628
00:47:25,997 --> 00:47:27,230
Kinkaid here.

629
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:29,332
McMasters.

630
00:47:32,202 --> 00:47:34,271
You got the demands?

631
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:37,075
They're on their way.

632
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:40,044
<i>I'm gonna need my medication.</i>

633
00:47:40,078 --> 00:47:42,080
I know,
your meds are on the way.

634
00:47:42,113 --> 00:47:48,452
I need it now...
or everybody is gonna die.

635
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:50,821
<i>Medication.</i>

636
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:52,990
My medication.

637
00:47:54,158 --> 00:47:55,392
Now.

638
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:11,508
[grunting]

639
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:15,612
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll whack himself.

640
00:48:18,082 --> 00:48:19,984
Sounds like he's losing it.

641
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:24,287
Goddammit, fuck!
Shit, fuck!

642
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,523
[grunting]

643
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:38,602
We're gonna get them all killed.

644
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:42,539
Don't talk like that.

645
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,995
[whispers] Come on.

646
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:11,768
Come on.

647
00:49:30,288 --> 00:49:33,191
What exactly
is your fucking problem?

648
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:34,926
We gotta move faster.

649
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:37,862
Snake, I need you
to do negotiations, please.

650
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,030
Yeah.

651
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:42,166
I'll get us out of here.

652
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,601
- You just--
- No, no, no, no, no.

653
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,471
You don't understand, man.

654
00:49:48,505 --> 00:49:50,875
I gotta get out of here, now.

655
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:55,612
If I move too fast,
we're gonna end up right back
in this fuckin' place.

656
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,381
Just calm down.

657
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,584
I can't stay calm.

658
00:50:18,236 --> 00:50:20,104
[sniffles]

659
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:25,877
I need my medication.

660
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,081
I need to get out of here
if I don't have my medication.

661
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,883
I gotta go, now.

662
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:35,019
You're gonna have to get
your shit under control, man.

663
00:50:35,052 --> 00:50:36,686
I'll get us out of here.

664
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,556
Don't touch me.

665
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:44,694
I'll get your meds,
you got that?

666
00:50:45,428 --> 00:50:46,596
Now come on.

667
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,965
No.

668
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,734
I'm gonna stay here.

669
00:50:58,742 --> 00:51:01,245
There's too many people
out there.

670
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:03,147
McMasters.

671
00:51:10,121 --> 00:51:11,554
Dammit.

672
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:15,026
Fuck.

673
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,468
Hey, Raj,
leave the bitch alone.

674
00:51:27,104 --> 00:51:28,638
McMasters is sick,
I'm in charge.

675
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,375
- Who said?
- I did.

676
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:33,443
So you're the one
who's gonna get me my money now?

677
00:51:33,476 --> 00:51:36,813
I'm gonna get the money for us,
not for you, for us.

678
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:39,783
Get on with it, shit's taken
long enough already.

679
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:58,802
[phone rings]

680
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:01,838
- Who's this?
- This is Kinkaid.

681
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:05,076
Can we talk about
how this all got started?

682
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:10,081
I mean, whose idea was it
to rush the bullpen,
take hostages?

683
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:13,284
McMasters?

684
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:15,585
Kinkaid, this is Snake.

685
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:18,255
McMasters is sick,
he needs his meds.

686
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:20,091
<i>He's strugglin'.</i>

687
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:22,492
<i>I, uh-- I was just--</i>

688
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:24,895
I saw that in his file.

689
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:27,198
But even if he
took them right now

690
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:29,967
it would take a while for them
to build up in his system.

691
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,104
- You understand?
- I want it now.

692
00:52:33,137 --> 00:52:34,939
How about...

693
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,478
How about if we transferred you
to a minimum security prison,

694
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:41,778
would that help things along?

695
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:43,147
Transfer?

696
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,548
He'd never go for transfer.

697
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:48,618
We want money
and safe passage in Mexico.

698
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:52,555
$4 million,
a helicopter, Mexico.

699
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:57,594
I could promise you
that I would do my best.

700
00:52:57,627 --> 00:52:59,864
But you know
that's not gonna happen, right?

701
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:01,432
Man, you don't got much time.

702
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:03,467
I'm not asking you
to sell out your friends.

703
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:06,137
I know you're not
that kind of guy.

704
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:10,840
But Raj and McMasters,

705
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:13,411
<i>they're a whole another story.</i>

706
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:15,645
<i>Before you say anything,</i>

707
00:53:15,678 --> 00:53:18,115
<i>I'd like to tell you</i>
<i>something man to man.</i>

708
00:53:18,149 --> 00:53:23,220
I'm so glad that you've
taken over the situation.

709
00:53:23,254 --> 00:53:27,324
I mean, you're the only
rational mind in the room,

710
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:29,026
you know what I mean?

711
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:31,694
And I'll make you this promise.

712
00:53:31,728 --> 00:53:35,933
I will get you those meds
as soon as possible.

713
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:38,302
Okay?

714
00:53:38,335 --> 00:53:40,004
Hurry up, please.

715
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:44,542
That's a win.

716
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:46,676
Huge win.

717
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:55,352
Raj, go check on
that son of a bitch.

718
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:57,754
- He's flipping out in there.
- Why don't you do it?

719
00:53:57,787 --> 00:54:01,791
'Cause I said for you to.
Do you understand me?

720
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:04,727
[Raj] Damn bullshit.

721
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:06,763
It's just starting right now.

722
00:54:21,278 --> 00:54:22,679
McMasters.

723
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:26,417
- McMasters.
- [gasps]

724
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,219
- You okay?
- Who are you?

725
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:30,787
Raj.

726
00:54:32,256 --> 00:54:34,724
- Who?
- Raj, man.

727
00:54:34,757 --> 00:54:37,727
- You all right?
- You got my meds?

728
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,662
We're working on it,
just give it a beat.

729
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,565
- We're working on it.
- Give me my meds, man.

730
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,968
Put the gun down, man.
Chill out, dude.

731
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:45,903
- Give me my fucking meds.
- We're working on the meds.

732
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:48,139
Put the fucking gun down, man.

733
00:55:09,326 --> 00:55:11,929
Who gave you the authority
to promise him meds?

734
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:14,398
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Kinkaid?

735
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,634
I'm trying to stop
a bloodbath.

736
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:20,271
Kinkaid's taking over
the negotiations.

737
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:23,207
Let's just get these meds
ready for delivery.

738
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,012
No. There will be
no meds delivered.

739
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:31,549
Do you understand the extent
of the situation over there?

740
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:33,584
Nothing will be
given to that group

741
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:35,752
without concessions
on their part.

742
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:41,091
If McMasters goes psychotic,
there'll be no negotiations
just an aftermath.

743
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:44,061
My position
is not up for debate.

744
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,264
From here on out,

745
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:49,533
this situation will be
handled by the book.

746
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,768
No concessions.

747
00:56:05,382 --> 00:56:06,716
[Raj] Snake.

748
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:14,892
Look, I know you and McMasters
go back a long ways.

749
00:56:15,993 --> 00:56:19,697
That dude's lost it
and that's a big problem.

750
00:56:19,729 --> 00:56:23,701
But Kinkaid said
he's gonna get the meds.
I know he's gonna come through.

751
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:26,170
Yeah, well he better
and quickly.

752
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:28,738
Otherwise we're gonna
have to take out
that damn freak ourselves.

753
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:30,840
You saw how he
pulled his guns on us.

754
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:33,978
What the fuck are you afraid of?
You've got a gun, too.

755
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:36,580
Get in there and watch him.

756
00:56:36,614 --> 00:56:38,983
Just don't fucking kill him.

757
00:56:39,016 --> 00:56:43,020
[scoffs]
You wanna take all the fun
out of this for me, huh?

758
00:56:43,053 --> 00:56:46,190
Look, I don't give a shit.

759
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:49,759
I'm not sure which one
of you assholes scares me more.

760
00:56:50,527 --> 00:56:51,895
[scoffs]

761
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:09,647
Just hang in there, Cherry.

762
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,982
They're gonna get us
out of here, I promise.

763
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,785
[sniffles]
I'll be dead by then.

764
00:57:15,818 --> 00:57:17,721
No, you won't.

765
00:57:17,755 --> 00:57:20,257
Just hang in there,
just a little longer.

766
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:22,026
It'll be over soon.

767
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:24,161
Think about your daughter.

768
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:28,065
I am, but I'm not sure
I can get out of this.

769
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:31,769
Please, and I'll be
any good for anyone.

770
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:36,340
Just a little longer.
It'll be over soon.

771
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,678
Davis, can you see it?

772
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:42,913
They're screwing
this whole thing up.

773
00:57:42,946 --> 00:57:45,115
They're gonna get us killed.

774
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:58,429
[suspenseful music playing]

775
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:03,067
What you're proposing
is gonna get people killed.

776
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,601
It's gonna get cops killed.

777
00:58:04,635 --> 00:58:07,938
And I don't think it's legal
to withhold meds from this man.

778
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:10,774
Is that how you feel also?

779
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:14,678
Rodriguez, mistakes were made.

780
00:58:14,712 --> 00:58:16,313
It happens in a negotiation.

781
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:18,749
It's the nature of the game,
come on.

782
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:21,151
Nothing will be
sent to that bullpen.

783
00:58:21,185 --> 00:58:24,988
No more food, no water.
Nothing.

784
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:31,295
And there will be no more
communication with that bullpen
until they call us.

785
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:35,065
Your hard line approach
is gonna blow up in our faces.

786
00:58:52,483 --> 00:58:54,418
[laughing]

787
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,293
[Raj] What's so damn funny?

788
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:06,163
What's funny?

789
00:59:06,196 --> 00:59:08,565
Your so called leader
is back there losing it.

790
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:13,103
He's gonna get you both killed
or kill you both himself.

791
00:59:15,272 --> 00:59:16,774
Shut up!

792
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:19,276
[grunting]

793
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,290
[winces] Fuck! Fuck!

794
01:00:10,828 --> 01:00:12,796
Fuck, man.

795
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,498
I need to get control.

796
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,836
I have to take control
of the situation.

797
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,104
[suspenseful music playing]

798
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,546
Fuck.

799
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,350
Fuck.

800
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:09,988
Snake, may I talk to you?

801
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,021
What do you want?

802
01:01:11,054 --> 01:01:12,489
It's about Davis.

803
01:01:12,523 --> 01:01:16,560
He's in a very bad shape.
He's unconscious.

804
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:19,964
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, no, I swear.

805
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:22,699
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

806
01:01:25,168 --> 01:01:28,539
- Please help.
- I'll take care of this.

807
01:01:28,572 --> 01:01:30,207
Thank you.

808
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:41,818
[phone ringing]

809
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:54,999
Snake, this is Rodriguez.

810
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:58,669
[Snake] <i>Who is this?</i>
<i>Every time I call</i>
<i>it's a new bullshitter.</i>

811
01:01:58,702 --> 01:02:00,203
What can I do for you, Snake?

812
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:02,406
I asked for some meds.

813
01:02:02,439 --> 01:02:06,209
And I gotta tell you
one of your hostages
is in bad shape.

814
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:14,318
So are you offering me
Captain Davis for the meds?

815
01:02:14,351 --> 01:02:17,454
No, I'm just
giving you information.

816
01:02:18,856 --> 01:02:21,291
Well, if you want the meds,

817
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:23,160
you're gonna have to
give us the captain.

818
01:02:23,193 --> 01:02:26,663
I don't give a damn
about the meds.

819
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:31,268
The captain on the other hand,
you want him, make an offer.

820
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,805
I don't give a fuck
if he dies or not.

821
01:02:36,406 --> 01:02:40,577
Well, Snake, you do know
that it's murder?

822
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:43,647
Look, dumbass, who do you
think you're dealing with?

823
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,651
We're facing life
no matter what happens
if we ever get out of here.

824
01:02:50,387 --> 01:02:51,822
Let me call you back, Snake.

825
01:02:51,856 --> 01:02:53,624
Suit yourself.

826
01:03:01,065 --> 01:03:03,333
What are you
gonna offer him now?

827
01:03:05,268 --> 01:03:07,237
The meds for the captain.

828
01:03:08,739 --> 01:03:11,742
You know the difference
between you and Kinkaid?

829
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:13,310
[Rodriguez] Hm?

830
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:16,948
Kinkaid recognized that he
underestimated that asshole.

831
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:18,749
He actually gave a damn.

832
01:03:18,782 --> 01:03:21,818
You're too arrogant to recognize
or care about anything.

833
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,756
- I can have you removed.
- [scoffs]

834
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:27,925
You have no authority over me.

835
01:03:27,959 --> 01:03:30,460
You have no authority over me!

836
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:33,965
I'm losing, I'm losing.

837
01:03:33,998 --> 01:03:37,200
If there is a God
I will believe in you.

838
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:41,271
Please send me magic and power.
Get me out of here.

839
01:03:41,304 --> 01:03:43,640
Please. Please.

840
01:03:43,674 --> 01:03:45,409
[sobs]

841
01:03:58,288 --> 01:04:01,458
Snake, may I go
to the bathroom?

842
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:06,030
[Snake] Yeah.

843
01:04:06,064 --> 01:04:08,598
- Come with me.
- Okay.

844
01:04:12,636 --> 01:04:14,838
Please--
Please, don't hurt me.

845
01:04:14,872 --> 01:04:16,908
Don't hurt me.
[whimpers]

846
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:21,411
Save that bullshit
for McMasters.

847
01:04:21,445 --> 01:04:23,014
I don't wanna hurt you.

848
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:24,982
I don't wanna fuck you.

849
01:04:25,016 --> 01:04:28,152
Torture, pain.

850
01:04:28,186 --> 01:04:31,722
That's what I want.
That's what I need.

851
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:37,095
Relax, I'm not going anywhere.

852
01:04:37,128 --> 01:04:38,762
I'm not.

853
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:42,532
You know what your problem is?

854
01:04:42,566 --> 01:04:45,469
You try so hard to be in control
but you're not in control.

855
01:04:45,502 --> 01:04:50,540
Let me tell you this.
I'm a fucking whore.

856
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:53,677
If I fuck one more man,
doesn't make any difference.

857
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:57,014
But it will make difference
for you, remember that.

858
01:04:57,048 --> 01:04:59,217
If you fuck me right now,

859
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:03,855
you lose control over me
and get fucking punished.

860
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:06,256
[screaming]

861
01:05:08,558 --> 01:05:09,994
[sobbing]

862
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:19,636
I'm done with you.

863
01:05:27,078 --> 01:05:28,745
[whimpering]

864
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:49,000
What are you doing?

865
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:52,569
Get out there, now!

866
01:05:57,175 --> 01:05:59,676
[suspenseful music playing]

867
01:06:09,419 --> 01:06:11,621
[line ringing]

868
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:15,358
Who's this?

869
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:17,360
This is Rodriguez.

870
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,695
I'm calling to make an offer.

871
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:20,932
Look, I wanna talk to Kinkaid.

872
01:06:20,965 --> 01:06:22,632
Kinkaid here.

873
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:25,937
I've got somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

874
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,104
Hold on.

875
01:06:34,245 --> 01:06:37,114
[Cherry]
<i>Is this FBI Agent Kinkaid?</i>

876
01:06:38,316 --> 01:06:40,517
Yes, this is Kinkaid.
Who is this?

877
01:06:41,852 --> 01:06:43,787
Nice to hear your voice.

878
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,223
It's Cherry.

879
01:06:45,256 --> 01:06:47,892
I wanna talk to you about Davis,
the captain.

880
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:49,559
I'm listening.

881
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,230
<i>I think he'll die if he</i>
<i>doesn't go to see a doctor.</i>

882
01:06:52,263 --> 01:06:56,633
And he's breathing very poor

883
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:59,937
and right now
he's suddenly unconscious.

884
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:04,876
Cherry, how are you?
Have they hurt you?

885
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:08,079
I'm... I'm, uh...

886
01:07:11,315 --> 01:07:13,918
I'm fine, I'll be fine.

887
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:23,793
So what's your offer?

888
01:07:24,694 --> 01:07:25,829
So, Snake,

889
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:30,334
the offer is
meds for the captain.

890
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:32,569
Look, this is how it is.

891
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:36,240
In an hour I give Davis to Raj
to use as a toy.

892
01:07:36,274 --> 01:07:37,975
Then I give Cherry
to McMasters.

893
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:41,845
Now I want those meds and food,
then we'll talk.

894
01:07:52,056 --> 01:07:54,125
I had a rapport with Snake.

895
01:07:55,927 --> 01:07:57,527
Good job.

896
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,163
[suspenseful music playing]

897
01:09:20,878 --> 01:09:23,613
It's been a few minutes
since the food was delivered.

898
01:09:23,646 --> 01:09:25,182
You wanna check in now?

899
01:09:26,217 --> 01:09:29,753
Uh... Yeah.

900
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:41,032
- Who is it this time?
<i>- Snake, it's Kinkaid.</i>

901
01:09:42,133 --> 01:09:43,566
The food okay?

902
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,169
Yeah, man, it's good.

903
01:09:45,202 --> 01:09:51,208
Now, I-I sent you, uh,
a gesture of good faith.

904
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:52,776
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

905
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:55,079
Meds for McMasters.

906
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:58,648
<i>It's in one</i>
<i>of the food containers.</i>

907
01:09:58,681 --> 01:10:01,485
Hey, Kinkaid, I appreciate it.
Thanks, man.

908
01:10:01,519 --> 01:10:03,888
All right, now listen, uh,

909
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:07,258
you give me a call
when you're ready to talk.

910
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,126
<i>Yeah, I'll do that.</i>

911
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:23,074
Chris, could we put together
a list of potential prisons

912
01:10:23,107 --> 01:10:25,242
that we could
transfer these guys to?

913
01:10:25,276 --> 01:10:27,677
Sure, I can do that.

914
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,915
McMasters is gonna be
especially difficult though.

915
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:37,687
You know, I must admit,
Snakes' demeanor changed.

916
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,192
But those meds were
our biggest bargaining chip.

917
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:42,460
And now they're gone.

918
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:46,696
I think the bigger question
is did we get it to him in time?

919
01:10:47,465 --> 01:10:49,666
Yeah.

920
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:52,536
Kinkaid said
they put a tranquilizer
in a food container.

921
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:54,105
Did we throw that shit away?

922
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:55,605
Yeah.

923
01:11:03,646 --> 01:11:05,282
Ah, shit.

924
01:11:17,094 --> 01:11:19,597
Man, there's only
one in here.

925
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:21,398
I hope this shit works.

926
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:23,267
Damn straight.

927
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,568
Look, I ain't scared of much,

928
01:11:24,602 --> 01:11:27,505
but that son of a bitch
scares the shit out of me.

929
01:11:27,538 --> 01:11:29,373
When are we
gettin' to Mexico?

930
01:11:29,406 --> 01:11:32,076
Soon. Very soon.

931
01:11:45,089 --> 01:11:46,590
[Kinkaid on phone]
<i>You got Kinkaid.</i>

932
01:11:46,624 --> 01:11:48,159
Hey, Kinkaid, listen, uh,

933
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:50,561
I need to get Davis
out of here to a doctor.

934
01:11:50,594 --> 01:11:52,563
Man, I got two problems though.

935
01:11:52,596 --> 01:11:54,031
<i>What are the problems?</i>

936
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:56,666
Look, these two think
we're headed to Mexico.

937
01:11:56,699 --> 01:12:01,338
And if I give up Davis,
they're gonna want answers.

938
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:03,806
- <i>Are they armed?</i>
- Yes.

939
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:07,178
<i>Snake, this is the deal:</i>

940
01:12:08,778 --> 01:12:12,183
<i>I can get you into</i>
<i>a minimum security prison.</i>

941
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,554
<i>Will Raj go for the same deal?</i>

942
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:19,156
Man, if he doesn't
I'm gonna have to kill him.

943
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:23,527
I have no idea
what I'm gonna be dealing with
once McMasters wakes up.

944
01:12:23,561 --> 01:12:27,398
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>I can do with McMasters.</i>
<i>No one will take him.</i>

945
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:31,902
<i>Now, you give me, Davis,</i>

946
01:12:31,936 --> 01:12:36,307
<i>and I'll get you and Raj</i>
<i>into minimum security prisons.</i>

947
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,341
<i>That's the deal.</i>

948
01:12:37,374 --> 01:12:40,177
<i>But you've got to</i>
<i>convince Raj, okay?</i>

949
01:12:40,211 --> 01:12:42,779
Yeah, that sounds good.

950
01:12:56,961 --> 01:12:59,029
I'm worried about Snake.

951
01:13:00,064 --> 01:13:02,967
He's the most rational
of the three, but...

952
01:13:04,935 --> 01:13:07,671
he sounded scared of Raj.

953
01:13:07,705 --> 01:13:11,075
I just wonder
how persuasive Snake can be.

954
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:26,557
You said we'd be out of this
shit hole and in Mexico by now.

955
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:29,792
That was the motherfucking deal,
period.

956
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:34,797
Between him
and the two cops we killed,

957
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:36,766
this deal went south.

958
01:13:36,799 --> 01:13:39,570
So the plan's
changed now, huh?

959
01:13:39,603 --> 01:13:43,340
It's because of
you and McMasters
that this deal's dead.

960
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:47,044
You know what,
fuck the cops, fuck McMasters.

961
01:13:47,077 --> 01:13:50,481
Why did the plan change, huh?
Was it because of that whore?

962
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:53,417
Mesmerized her with your voodoo
like she did him?

963
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:54,851
Let me tell you something.

964
01:13:54,885 --> 01:13:57,921
If I go to prison,
that bitch dies.

965
01:13:57,955 --> 01:14:02,026
Raj, minimum security prison.

966
01:14:02,059 --> 01:14:04,728
It's a fucking country club,
that's what our offer is.

967
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:06,664
[Raj] It's life, Snake.

968
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:09,533
We'll still be
in prison for life.

969
01:14:09,566 --> 01:14:12,835
You guys have life,
I had short time.

970
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:15,339
- You guys had life.
- Yeah, I had life.

971
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:17,541
That's why I listened
to you and McMasters.

972
01:14:17,574 --> 01:14:19,410
We're supposed to be
in Mexico.

973
01:14:19,443 --> 01:14:23,213
You know what, I think
I can make it still, too.

974
01:14:23,247 --> 01:14:27,217
No, we can't make it.
It's over.

975
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:31,655
Yeah, we can't, Snake.

976
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:34,658
I-- I'm gonna make it.

977
01:14:34,692 --> 01:14:37,061
And the princess
is going with me.

978
01:14:37,094 --> 01:14:42,032
Look, man, we're lucky Davis
is still alive.

979
01:14:42,066 --> 01:14:45,269
Without that bitch,
I got no power left.

980
01:14:45,302 --> 01:14:48,972
Well, I guess
you're fucked then, ain't you?

981
01:14:49,006 --> 01:14:51,275
You know what,
I'm in charge.

982
01:14:53,177 --> 01:14:56,347
You and McMasters
can leave whenever you want.

983
01:14:57,214 --> 01:14:58,682
Bitch is mine.

984
01:14:58,716 --> 01:15:00,584
[suspenseful music playing]

985
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,879
[phone ringing]

986
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:36,887
Snake, did you
work things out with Raj?

987
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,989
Yeah, we talked.

988
01:15:39,022 --> 01:15:41,425
<i>And the answer's</i>
<i>go fuck yourself.</i>

989
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,130
Snake and McMasters
can leave whenever they want.

990
01:15:46,163 --> 01:15:49,366
The bitch and I want
a helicopter on out of here.

991
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:58,609
Raj, I can't get you
a helicopter.

992
01:16:00,244 --> 01:16:02,546
<i>Only the governor</i>
<i>can approve that.</i>

993
01:16:03,947 --> 01:16:07,151
All right, have it your way.

994
01:16:07,184 --> 01:16:09,653
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I've been wanting to die.</i>

995
01:16:09,686 --> 01:16:11,388
<i>Maybe tonight's the night.</i>

996
01:16:11,422 --> 01:16:15,592
But the bitch goes with me
and that's on your ass.

997
01:16:27,304 --> 01:16:29,006
Oh, God.

998
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:34,578
So what exactly did he say?

999
01:16:36,814 --> 01:16:40,484
He said he can't
authorize a chopper.

1000
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,454
So you say you're gonna
kill yourself and the bitch.

1001
01:16:43,487 --> 01:16:47,825
[chuckles]
Yeah, and I mean to do it.

1002
01:16:47,859 --> 01:16:49,326
So I'm fucked?

1003
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,094
I need the bitch
for my transfer.

1004
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:53,664
Well, that's not my
fucking problem now, is it?

1005
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,199
Why do you wanna kill me?

1006
01:16:55,232 --> 01:16:56,967
I didn't do anything wrong.

1007
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,736
I have a daughter.
She needs me.

1008
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,572
Do you have a fucking heart?

1009
01:17:01,605 --> 01:17:04,107
I don't want to die.

1010
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:07,912
If I have to pay,
they have to pay.

1011
01:17:07,946 --> 01:17:11,648
And you have to pay.
That's just how it works.

1012
01:17:11,682 --> 01:17:13,584
Okay, then.

1013
01:17:13,617 --> 01:17:17,421
Then may I talk to my daughter
for the one last time?

1014
01:17:18,655 --> 01:17:22,861
Snake, can I speak to
my daughter one last time?

1015
01:17:22,894 --> 01:17:25,496
- I don't see why not.
- Thank you.

1016
01:17:28,499 --> 01:17:31,502
You can play up
those tears all you want,

1017
01:17:31,535 --> 01:17:33,237
but I know the truth.

1018
01:17:33,837 --> 01:17:34,939
What truth?

1019
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:36,707
The truth about
you and Snake.

1020
01:17:37,808 --> 01:17:39,042
What about us?

1021
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:41,745
You're crazy, there's nothing--
fucking truth.

1022
01:17:41,778 --> 01:17:43,347
There's no fucking truth
between us.

1023
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,182
I'm just trying
to stay alive.

1024
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:47,384
I'll do anything
to achieve that.

1025
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,753
Do you understand,
motherfucker?

1026
01:17:49,786 --> 01:17:50,955
- Shut up!
- Okay.

1027
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:53,156
Another truth, Raj.

1028
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:57,394
The truth about your sorry ass.

1029
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:02,799
You want to talk about that?

1030
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,201
You want to talk about that?

1031
01:18:04,234 --> 01:18:07,371
Shut up, bitch,
or I'll kill you right now.

1032
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:10,073
Go ahead, kill me,
I'm already dead.

1033
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:15,178
But before that, let's discuss
the truth about you,

1034
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:17,949
how you murdered a woman
because you can't
get up for one.

1035
01:18:17,982 --> 01:18:24,154
A prison turned her
into a fucking asshole
for old real men.

1036
01:18:24,187 --> 01:18:26,623
You lying whore.

1037
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:29,359
You're never gonna see
your daughter again.

1038
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:31,662
- We'll see about that.
- Shut up.

1039
01:18:31,695 --> 01:18:34,665
I need to call Kinkaid
and make a deal for myself.

1040
01:18:34,698 --> 01:18:37,834
You're on your own
and stay the fuck away from me.

1041
01:18:43,173 --> 01:18:45,342
[phone ringing]

1042
01:18:48,612 --> 01:18:50,847
Hello, Snake?

1043
01:18:50,882 --> 01:18:53,216
[Snake]
<i>I wanna talk to Kinkaid.</i>

1044
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,152
Kinkaid's not here.

1045
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:57,187
He's trying to find a way
to help out your friend.

1046
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,323
Fuck him.
He's not my friend,

1047
01:18:59,356 --> 01:19:01,025
