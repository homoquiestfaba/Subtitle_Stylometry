1
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,319
NOSTALGIA FOR THE LIGHT

2
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,799
The old German telescope,

3
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,799
...that I've seen once again
after so many years,

4
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,479
...is still working

5
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,559
...in Santiago, Chile.

6
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,879
I owe my passion
for astronomy to it.

7
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,039
These objects, which
could have come...

8
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,959
...from my childhood home,

9
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,239
...remind me of that
far-off moment...

10
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,839
...when one thinks one
has left childhood behind.

11
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,839
At that time, Chile
was a haven of peace...

12
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,399
...isolated from the world.

13
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,559
Santiago slept...

14
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,999
...in the foothills of the Cordillera,
detached from the rest of the world.

15
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,799
I loved science-fiction stories,

16
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,159
...lunar eclipses

17
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,639
...and watching the sun through
a piece of smoky glass.

18
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,279
I learnt by heart the
name of certain stars

19
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,359
...and had a map of the sky.

20
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,239
It was a simple provincial life.

21
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,799
Nothing ever happened.

22
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,199
The Presidents of the Republic...

23
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,599
...walked unescorted
through the streets.

24
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,039
Only the present moment existed.

25
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,919
One day this peaceful life
came to an end.

26
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,999
A revolutionary tide swept us
to the centre of the world.

27
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,719
I was lucky to be a part
of this noble venture...

28
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,119
...which woke us all
from our slumber.

29
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,559
This time of hope is forever
engraved in my soul.

30
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,319
At around the same time,

31
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,799
...science fell in love
with the Chilean sky.

32
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,799
A group of astronomers...

33
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,519
...found they could
touch the stars...

34
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,879
...in the Atacama Desert.

35
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,999
Enveloped in star dust,

36
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,839
...scientists from all over the planet

37
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,479
...created the biggest
telescopes in the world.

38
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,199
Some time later,

39
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,559
...a coup d'etat swept
away democracy, dreams...

40
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,399
...and science.

41
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,879
Despite living in a devastation zone,

42
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,279
Chilean astronomers...

43
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,919
...carried on working, supported
by their foreign colleagues.

44
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,239
One by one,
the secrets of the sky...

45
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,119
...began to fall upon us
like translucent rain.

46
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,719
In Chile, astronomy is a
passion shared by many.

47
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,599
I'm just one enthusiast
amongst thousands.

48
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,919
Our humid planet has only
one small brown patch...

49
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,239
...that has absolutely no humidity.

50
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,759
The vast Atacama Desert.

51
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,279
I imagine that man
will soon walk on Mars.

52
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,439
This ground beneath my feet...

53
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,119
...bears the strongest resemblance
to that faraway world.

54
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,399
There is nothing.

55
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,479
No insects, no animals, no birds.

56
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,999
And yet, it is full of history.

57
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,079
For 10,000 years,

58
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,159
...this region has been
a transit route.

59
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,319
Rivers of stone...

60
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,559
...provided natural paths.

61
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,359
The caravans of llamas and men...

62
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,119
...came and went between
the high plains and the sea.

63
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,599
It's a condemned land,
permeated with salt,

64
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,119
...where human remains are mummified
and objects are frozen in time.

65
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,119
The air,

66
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,679
...transparent, thin,

67
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,759
...allows us to read...

68
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,079
...this vast open book of memory

69
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,559
...page after page.

70
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,839
The telescopes...

71
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,399
...are the window to the cosmos.

72
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,039
This is where the
celestial mystery begins.

73
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,159
In the glow of the night,
the stars observe us.

74
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,599
At the bottom of
the lakes of sand...

75
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,759
...are petrified fish and molluscs.

76
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,319
I can pick them up
with my hands.

77
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,119
The hills and the Indian
fortresses merge into one.

78
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,199
Apparently there are
meteorites under the rocks...

79
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,959
...that can affect a compass.

80
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,959
I have always believed...

81
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,879
...that our origins could
be found in the ground,

82
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,039
...buried beneath the soil
or at the bottom of the sea.

83
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,279
But now, I think that
our roots are up above,

84
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,479
...beyond the light.

85
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,559
Where do we come from,

86
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,199
...where are we and
where are we going?

87
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,919
Where do we come from?
It's a key question.

88
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,239
It has always been at the
core of our civilisations.

89
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,319
As for religion,

90
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,839
...the world of science today...

91
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,599
...tends to separate
science from religion.

92
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,159
And yet the fundamental questions
pondered by man

93
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,559
are of a religious origin and motive.

94
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,359
That's my opinion.

95
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,439
It's a matter of discovering
the origins of mankind,

96
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,919
...of our planet,
the solar system.

97
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,399
Finding out how a galaxy,
a planet or a star is born.

98
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,679
All these questions
about our origins,

99
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,199
...we astronomers try to answer.

100
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,039
It's a never-ending story.

101
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,759
What eats away at the
astronomer is "the origin of".

102
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
I study diffuse galaxies
whose origins are a mystery.

103
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,839
We don't know why they
do not self-destruct.

104
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,679
We try to shed light on
these difficult questions.

105
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,879
That is science.

106
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,399
We try to answer two questions,

107
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,479
...we do so as best we can,
and four more arise.

108
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,639
That is the nature of science.

109
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,839
Some say that we're
not very efficient,

110
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,959
...that in answering two questions,
we trigger four others.

111
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,719
But that's science;
it's never resolved.

112
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,319
That's what I like about it.

113
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,519
The mystery of science is eternal.

114
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,919
Below these domes...

115
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,479
...are other messages
which also come from afar.

116
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,359
These rock carvings,
made by pre-Columbian shepherds,

117
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,719
are over 1,000 years old.

118
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,079
Here, more than anywhere else,

119
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,519
I feel that the desert...

120
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,319
...is revealing a secret.

121
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,719
All of our life experiences,

122
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,879
...including this conversation,
happened in the past.

123
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,439
Even if it is a matter
of millionths of a second.

124
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,599
The camera I am looking at
now is a few metres away...

125
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:49,599
...and is therefore already several
millionths of a second in the past...

126
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,239
...in relation to the
time on my watch.

127
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,879
The signal takes time to arrive.

128
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,919
The light reflected from
the camera or from you,

129
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,119
...reaches me after a moment.

130
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,599
A fleeting moment, as the
speed of light is very fast.

131
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,359
How long does it take
for moonlight to reach us?

132
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,319
Just over a second.

133
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,759
- And sunlight?
- Eight minutes.

134
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,959
So we don't see things at the
very instant we look at them?

135
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,199
No, that's the trap.

136
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,239
The present doesn't exist.

137
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,919
It's true.

138
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,559
The only present that might exist...

139
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,159
...is the one in my mind.

140
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,959
It's the closest we come
to the absolute present.

141
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,079
And not even then!
When I think,

142
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,959
...it takes a moment for the signal
to travel between my senses.

143
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,679
Between when I say "this is me"
and when I touch myself,

144
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,399
...there is a lapse in time.

145
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,799
The past is the astronomers' main tool.

146
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,799
We manipulate the past.

147
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,479
We are used to living
behind the times.

148
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,159
That's how it is.

149
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,519
Like an archaeologist
who also studies the past.

150
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,199
Exactly.

151
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,319
A not-so-distant past,
but it's the same.

152
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,919
- He tries to imagine...
- Exactly.

153
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,879
A historian does the same thing.

154
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,319
Geologists, too.

155
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,199
They know that the deeper they dig,
the older the things they'll find.

156
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,839
It's the same for us.

157
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,959
The present is a fine line.

158
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,119
A puff of air would destroy it.

159
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,599
On this flat rock face...

160
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,559
...are the outlines of two
human faces, perhaps masks.

161
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,519
They were carved by the
pre-Columbian shepherds...

162
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,159
...who passed through here.

163
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,879
It was a natural route
to San Pedro de Atacama.

164
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,359
These drawings resemble those
carved on the mountain opposite.

165
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,439
We are on the prehistoric road
that runs alongside the rock drawings.

166
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,159
The modern road was laid
on top of the old one.

167
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,599
There on the right,

168
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,279
...we can see drawings
of llamas and people.

169
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,799
The astronomers...

170
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,959
...created an enormous telescope...

171
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,079
...to bring two seemingly
incompatible things closer:

172
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,719
...the origins of everything...

173
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,799
...and the past of
everything we are today.

174
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,559
Two different situations...

175
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,239
Today they receive the past.

176
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,759
But, at the same time, they receive
the most distant past of all...

177
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,959
...which is the origin
of the whole system.

178
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,959
They study one past
and we study another.

179
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,519
They are in the present
recording a past...

180
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,519
...which they have to reconstruct.

181
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,719
They have only minute clues.

182
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,039
They are archaeologists like us.

183
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,679
Why are some places more suitable
for this study of the past?

184
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,679
It's a real mystery.

185
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,719
The question is: why are there
archaeologists and astronomers...

186
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,719
...in the same place?

187
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,239
The answer is simple.

188
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,279
Here, the past is more
accessible than elsewhere.

189
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,919
The translucency of the sky...

190
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,319
is, for the archaeologists of space,

191
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,599
...what the dry climate is for us.

192
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,439
It facilitates our access
to evidence from the past.

193
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,279
The translucency enables
the astronomers...

194
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,759
...to shed light on the
mysteries of space.

195
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,399
This is why
we share the same territory.

196
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,959
We are at a gateway to the past.

197
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,999
That's right. It's a gateway
we know how to go through.

198
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,999
But when we come out again,

199
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,999
...will we have made discoveries
that will shake our lives forever?

200
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,479
This remains a mystery to me.

201
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,879
And yet, this country has
not yet considered its past.

202
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,399
It is held in the grasp
of the coup d'etat...

203
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,399
...which seems to immobilise it.

204
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,479
This is the paradox
which concerns you most.

205
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,199
This is where the problem lies.

206
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,719
It's worthy of your concern.

207
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,159
I totally agree with you.

208
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,999
It's true that it's paradoxical.

209
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,719
We've hidden away...

210
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,879
...our nearest past.

211
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,399
It's a huge paradox.

212
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,719
Listen, we know hardly anything
about the 19th century.

213
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,239
How many secrets
are we keeping...

214
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,879
...about the 19th century?

215
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,319
We have never acknowledged
that we marginalised our Indians.

216
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,279
It's practically a state secret.

217
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,839
We've done nothing
to try to understand...

218
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,679
...why, in the 19th century,

219
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,519
...staggering economic phenomena
such as saltpetre appeared,

220
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,639
...yet today there's nothing left.

221
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,079
We've kept our
recent past hidden.

222
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,719
We've concealed it.

223
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,959
It's absurd.

224
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,199
We avoid looking at
this recent history.

225
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,159
It's as if this history
might accuse us.

226
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,519
And that, dear friend,
helps no one.

227
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,959
Not the right, not the
centre, not the left.

228
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,719
Like other of the planet's deserts,

229
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,599
...the Chilean desert is an
ocean of buried minerals.

230
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,719
In the open air...

231
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,719
...lie men who died working.

232
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,239
Like geological layers,

233
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,199
...layers of miners and of Indians...

234
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,799
...are swept by a relentless wind.

235
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,439
They were nomadic families.

236
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,759
Their belongings, their
memories are nearby.

237
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,479
Near the observatories, in the
middle of this vast emptiness...

238
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,879
...are the ruins of Chacabuco,

239
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,839
...the biggest concentration camp
of Pinochet's dictatorship.

240
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,119
The ruins of this camp...

241
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,279
...are in fact the ruins of a mine.

242
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,759
The military didn't have to build
a camp, as, by way of cells,

243
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,439
...they used the houses
of the 19th-century miners,

244
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,159
...a time when the mining
industry was like slavery.

245
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,599
All the military had to do...

246
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,159
...was to add barbed wire.

247
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,839
I was imprisoned in a
concentration camp in the North

248
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,799
...from November 9th, 1973,

249
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,199
...until October 1974.

250
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,639
In Chacabuco, did you
hear of a group...

251
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,639
...who observed the stars?

252
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,519
Yes, I was part of this group.

253
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,919
There were about 20 of us.

254
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,479
Was the person who led
the group an astronomer?

255
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,519
He was a doctor who knew a lot
about astronomy: Dr Alvarez.

256
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,159
During the day, he
gave us theory lessons...

257
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,959
...and, at night, we went
outside to watch the stars.

258
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,879
What we learnt of astronomy...

259
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,639
...was to recognise the constellations.

260
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,519
- Did you have a
telescope? - No.

261
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,239
The sky was so transparent...

262
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,279
...that the stars...

263
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,159
...were like small light bulbs.

264
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,199
How did you find
the constellations?

265
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,039
He showed us how
to make a device.

266
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,119
A tripod with a dial on top...

267
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,759
...that showed the hours.

268
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,879
A kind of balance contraption
was fixed on that...

269
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,799
...with a needle and
two crossed wires.

270
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,039
That served as a viewfinder.

271
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,079
What did you feel watching
the stars whilst in prison?

272
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,159
We all had a feeling...

273
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,119
...of great freedom.

274
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,079
Observing the sky and the stars,

275
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,599
...marvelling at the constellations,

276
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,159
...we felt completely free.

277
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,399
"In this house lived the
following political prisoners:

278
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,039
Victor Astudillo,

279
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,519
Luis Henriquez,

280
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,319
René Olivares,

281
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,119
Enrique..."
You can only see the "E".

282
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,399
"Enrique Pastorelli."
I remember him well.

283
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,439
And here: "Federico
Quilodrán Chávez."

284
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,559
The military banned
the astronomy lessons.

285
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,479
They were convinced that
the prisoners could escape...

286
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,599
...guided by the constellations.

287
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,519
Luis's dignity lies in his memory.

288
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,279
He wasn't able to escape,

289
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,599
...but, by communicating
with the stars,

290
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,159
...he managed to preserve
his inner freedom.

291
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,079
He remembers traces
that have been erased,

292
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,839
...electric cables, watchtowers.

293
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,679
Luis is a transmitter of history.

294
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,039
Miguel, the architect of memory,

295
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,439
...is also a lover of stars.

296
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,999
He was in five detention centres...

297
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,999
...where he contemplated the
sky and used his memory...

298
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,359
...to carve each prison
into his mind.

299
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,999
When the military saw...

300
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:29,199
...the published drawings of the
camps which they had dismantled,

301
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,719
...they were dumbstruck.

302
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,439
Like that.

303
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,519
That's how you measured?

304
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,039
That's right.

305
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,319
When I decided to
leave a testimony...

306
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,319
...of what a concentration
camp in Chile was like,

307
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,559
...I began to measure in this
way the different spaces,

308
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,479
...so as to be able to draw them
one day if I ever got out.

309
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,399
Each day as I walked to work,

310
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,519
I discreetly measured
the assembly courtyard.

311
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,559
It measured 30 metres,
ten by three or five by six.

312
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,279
There.

313
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,119
30 metres.

314
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,799
Here something important is missing.

315
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,279
At the far end was a
solitary confinement block.

316
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,639
It measured six by nine.

317
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,719
Here, there was
another row of barbed wire.

318
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,519
It was everywhere.

319
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,439
At night, by candle light,

320
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,559
...I made my drawings.

321
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,879
When I'd finished,

322
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,759
...I tore them into tiny shreds...

323
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,839
...that I hid in case
of a night raid.

324
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,479
The next day,
I was one of the first up

325
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,679
...and I went to the latrines
to get rid of them.

326
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,919
I memorised it all easily...

327
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,959
...and, when I was in
exile in Denmark,

328
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,359
...I drew these places again
as if I'd known them all my life.

329
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,359
That is memory.

330
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,679
An architect, at least, is capable...

331
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,119
...of memorising all the dimensions.

332
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,839
Miguel and his wife...

333
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,959
...are for me a metaphor of Chile.

334
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,279
He is remembering...

335
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,239
...whilst Anita is forgetting...

336
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,119
...as she has Alzheimer's disease.

337
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,359
At an altitude of 5,000 metres,
the radio telescope ALMA...

338
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,159
...is being made by
several countries.

339
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,279
It will have 60 antennas,

340
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,399
...or 60 ears to listen to
the waves of the sky.

341
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,519
It will be able to listen to bodies...

342
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,599
...whose light doesn't
reach the earth.

343
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,039
It will register the energy
produced during the Big Bang.

344
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,159
Victor, a 29-year-old engineer,

345
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,279
...will be one of the rare
witnesses to this event...

346
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,919
...which to me seems so unreal.

347
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,759
How did you get into astronomy?

348
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,599
My mother encouraged me to
apply to ESO, the observatory.

349
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,799
- You were born in Germany?
- Yes, Germany.

350
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,199
- So you are a child of exile.
- I'm a child from nowhere.

351
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,879
I'm not from Chile, nor am I from
the country where I was born.

352
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,679
- Do you feel comfortable here?
- Yes, I feel Chilean.

353
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,159
I am Chilean.

354
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,919
The energy this
antenna will detect...

355
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,039
...was emitted billions
of years ago.

356
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,479
It is from the past and
only reaches us today...

357
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,239
...but it belongs to
history, to the past.

358
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,519
Your mother was expelled from
Chile during the dictatorship.

359
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,839
Nowadays, she cares for
ex-prisoners who were tortured.

360
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,479
Are you aware that you and
your mother work in the past?

361
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,479
The past is at the
core of our work.

362
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,999
Both of us...

363
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,039
...try to learn from the
past, from history,

364
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,279
...to build a better future.

365
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,239
According to one official commission,

366
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,719
...30,000 people were tortured in Chile.

367
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,519
But it is estimated...

368
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,159
...that another 30,000
did not come forward.

369
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,199
The women who search
for their dead...

370
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,999
...demand an answer...

371
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,999
...from those responsible
for the disappearances.

372
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,879
These women...

373
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,959
...come across those who participated
in the disappearance of their relatives...

374
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,159
...in the streets of their villages.

375
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,119
The torturers...

376
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,599
...who walk free in the streets.

377
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,479
This kind of situation
is traumatic for those affected.

378
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,559
Crossing paths with someone...

379
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,559
...who arrested their
husband or son...

380
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,359
...traumatises them all over again.

381
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,359
Maybe this is one
of the differences...

382
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,519
...between the two
searches of the past.

383
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,639
What do you think
of these women...

384
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,679
...who search for the remains
of their loved ones?

385
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,919
They continue to sift the desert.

386
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,159
To compare two completely
different things,

387
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,599
...their process is similar to
ours, with one big difference.

388
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,119
We can sleep peacefully,

389
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,639
...after each night spent
observing the past.

390
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,519
Our search doesn't
disturb our sleep.

391
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,599
Sometimes the heat
bothers us, but we sleep.

392
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,319
The next day, we plunge back,
untroubled, into the past.

393
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,519
But these women must
find it hard to sleep...

394
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,599
...after searching
through human remains,

395
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,359
...looking for a past
they are unable to find.

396
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,959
They'll not sleep well
until they do so.

397
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,159
That is the major difference.

398
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,599
There's no comparison.

399
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,479
That's my opinion.

400
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,759
What is strange...

401
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,319
...is that society should understand
these women better...

402
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,959
...than it does astronomers.

403
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,359
But the opposite is true.

404
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,799
Society has a greater understanding
of the astronomers,

405
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,959
...in their search for the past,

406
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,079
...than of these women who
search for human remains.

407
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,439
There is a certain reticence
and that worries me.

408
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,599
People say, "It's in the
past, enough's enough!"

409
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,799
That's easy to say.

410
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,559
Until they find their loved ones,

411
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,959
...they'll never find peace.

412
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,199
I can't imagine what they
must be going through.

413
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,999
I don't know what I'd do...

414
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,119
...if a sister, a brother
or one of my parents...

415
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,399
...were lost somewhere in the desert,

416
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,919
...in this vast expanse.

417
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,119
Personally, as an astronomer,

418
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,279
...I would imagine my father
or mother in space,

419
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,999
...lost in the galaxy somewhere.

420
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,679
I would look for them
through the telescopes.

421
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,399
I would be very anxious...

422
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,279
...as it would be difficult to
find them in the vastness.

423
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,399
It's the same for these women...

424
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,279
...as the Atacama Desert is so immense.

425
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,199
Who knows where they are?

426
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,559
For 17 years, Pinochet assassinated
and buried the bodies...

427
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,319
...of thousands of political prisoners.

428
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,199
So that the bodies could never be found,

429
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:38,279
...the dictatorship dug them up and
disposed of the remains elsewhere...

430
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,999
...or threw them into the sea.

431
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,239
The women of Calama
searched for 28 years,

432
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,079
...until 2002.

433
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,279
Some of them continue to search
as victims are still being found.

434
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,359
During the shooting of this
film, they found the body...

435
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,159
...of a disappeared female prisoner...

436
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,239
...in another part of the desert.

437
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,519
These women...

438
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,399
...provided us with various facts,

439
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,759
...one of which proved vital.

440
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,879
Whilst searching in the desert,

441
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,959
...they discovered something curious:

442
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,799
...tiny pieces of human bones.

443
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,479
An expert confirmed
that these were indeed human bones.

444
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,399
It was strange,
the pieces were so tiny.

445
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,439
They weren't skeletons,

446
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,639
...but fragments of skulls, of feet,

447
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,719
...shards of long bones.

448
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,439
When they took us there,

449
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,279
...we, as archaeologists,

450
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,119
...noticed that the soil
had been turned over.

451
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,959
These fragments, which are flat,

452
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,479
...must be the splinters of a
thighbone or the bone of an arm.

453
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,399
The exterior of these
bones is smooth.

454
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,159
This must be the inside of a bone...

455
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,879
...as it is porous.

456
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,199
It is much thicker.

457
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,959
Their whiteness is due
to calcination by the sun.

458
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,959
What did you find of your brother?

459
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,799
A foot. It was still in his shoe.

460
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,879
Some of his teeth.

461
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,519
I found part of his
forehead, his nose,

462
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,199
...nearly all of the
left side of his skull.

463
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,959
The bit behind the ear
with a bullet mark.

464
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,479
The bullet came out here.

465
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,959
That shows he was shot from below.

466
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,119
I don't know what position he was in.

467
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,759
They finished him off
with a bullet in the forehead.

468
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:43,239
All of this part of the
skull was shattered.

469
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,759
They shot him twice in the head.

470
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,759
I remembered his tender expression...

471
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,039
...and this was all that remained.

472
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,679
A few teeth and bits of bones.

473
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,399
And a foot.

474
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,279
Our final moment together,

475
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,279
...was when his foot was at my house.

476
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,559
When the mass grave was discovered,

477
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,039
...I knew it was his shoe and his foot.

478
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,759
That night, I got up...

479
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,439
...and went to stroke his foot.

480
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,839
There was... a smell of decay.

481
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,959
It was still in a sock.

482
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,839
A burgundy sock.

483
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,359
Dark red.

484
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,079
I took it out of the bag
and looked at it.

485
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,839
I remained sitting in the
lounge for a long time.

486
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,559
My mind was blank.

487
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,919
I was incapable of thinking.

488
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,399
I was in total shock.

489
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,759
The next day, my
husband went to work...

490
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,479
...and I spent all morning
with my brother's foot.

491
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,959
We were reunited.

492
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,279
It was a great joy and
a great disappointment...

493
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,599
...because only then did I take in
the fact that my brother was dead.

494
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,479
The bodies of Calama...

495
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,959
...were dug up with a machine.

496
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,319
A machine that digs,

497
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,039
...with five teeth.

498
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:54,439
These bodies were dug up on the
orders of the military high command.

499
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,399
But fragments of skulls...

500
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,679
...fell from the right side
of the machine,

501
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,719
...and of feet, from the left side.

502
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,759
The bodies were loaded onto a truck.

503
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,639
We photographed the marks
and reconstructed the operation.

504
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,159
The bodies were then taken to a place
which even today remains unknown.

505
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,919
The truck had a driver.

506
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,519
There were soldiers
to unload the bodies.

507
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,999
And, most importantly, the truck
was part of a detachment,

508
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,759
...a division under military authority.

509
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,159
It's up to the military
to provide this information...

510
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,799
...so that our friends from Calama...

511
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,079
...can give their dead
the burial they deserve.

512
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,799
Will you carry on searching?

513
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,159
For as long as I can,

514
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,239
...if we must carry on searching,

515
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,559
...I will do so.

516
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,519
Even if I have many doubts...

517
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,879
...and I ask myself questions
which I can't answer.

518
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,559
They say they unearthed
them, put them in bags...

519
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,039
...and threw them into the sea.

520
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,119
Did they really throw
them into the sea?

521
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,079
I can't find the answer
to this question.

522
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,959
What if they threw them out nearby,
somewhere in the mountains?

523
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,599
At this point in my life,

524
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,479
...I'm 70,

525
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,119
...I find it hard to believe
what I'm told.

526
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,839
They taught me not to believe.

527
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,759
It's hard for me.

528
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,319
Sometimes I feel like an idiot...

529
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,839
...because I never stop
asking questions...

530
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,239
...and nobody gives me
the answers I want.

531
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,599
If someone were to tell me...

532
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,039
...they threw them out on
the top of that mountain,

533
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,479
...I would find a way of
getting right to the top.

534
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,919
I'm not as strong
as I was 20 years ago.

535
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,159
I'm not as healthy.

536
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,759
It would be difficult.

537
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,479
But hope gives you strength.

538
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,279
I no longer count the times...

539
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,999
...Vicky and I have gone
into the desert.

540
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,559
We set out full of hope...

541
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,719
...and return with our heads hanging.

542
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,159
But we always pick ourselves up,

543
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,159
...give ourselves a shake

544
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,399
... and set off again the next
day even more hopeful...

545
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,719
...and more impatient to find them.

546
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,919
Some people must wonder...

547
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,599
...why we want bones.

548
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,399
I want them so much!

549
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,759
And I'm not the only one.

550
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,399
When they found
one of Mario's jawbones,

551
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,319
...I told them I didn't want it.

552
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,759
I told Dr Patricia Hernández,

553
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,479
"I want him whole."

554
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,479
"They took him away whole,
I don't want just a piece of him."

555
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,639
And I'm not saying it just for him,

556
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,879
...but for all the disappeared.

557
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,199
All of them!

558
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,479
If I found him today and
I were to die tomorrow,

559
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,119
...I would die happy.

560
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,519
But I don't want to die.

561
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,839
I don't want to die
before I find him.

562
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,319
As I told you the other day,

563
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,159
...I wish the telescopes...

564
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,079
...didn't just look into the sky,

565
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,759
...but could also see
through the earth...

566
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,679
...so that we could find them.

567
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,399
Like this...

568
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,239
Then, a bit further on.

569
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,679
We would sweep the
desert with a telescope.

570
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,119
Downwards.

571
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,239
And give thanks to the stars
for helping us find them.

572
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,999
I'm just dreaming.

573
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,679
These lines you see on the
screen form a spectrum.

574
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,319
This is the digital imprint of a star.

575
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,479
This is the spectrum.

576
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,079
These are the calcium lines of the star.

577
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,399
If my son had been executed
during any dictatorship,

578
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,519
...no matter who I was,
my education or my beliefs,

579
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,359
...I would never be able to forget.

580
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,879
I would be morally obliged
to preserve his memory.

581
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,999
We cannot forget our dead.

582
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,679
We must keep them in our memory.

583
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,039
The courts of justice
must do their work,

584
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,639
...human rights organisations too,

585
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,599
...everyone involved
must take a stand.

586
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,679
That's to be expected.

587
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:54,239
But we absolutely cannot
forget a tragedy like this.

588
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:03,239
PISAGUA MASS GRAVE
JUNE 1990

589
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,519
We must continue the search.

590
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,079
If they were thrown into the sea,

591
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,879
...we will find a trace of them someday.

592
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,439
Many were indeed
thrown into the sea.

593
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,679
If they put the bodies in a mine,

594
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,159
...an abandoned place,
we'll find them eventually.

595
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:20,719
It suits them that there are
fewer and fewer of us women.

596
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,479
Fewer problems.

597
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,279
Because we are a problem.

598
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,999
For society, for justice, for everyone.

599
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,479
For them we are
the lowest of the low.

600
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,479
We are Chile's leprosy.

601
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,919
That's what I think.

602
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,679
IT WAS NOT A WAR
IT WAS A MASSACRE

603
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,599
There were many groups
of women searching:

604
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,759
...in Arica, Iquique,

605
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,119
...Pisagua, La Serena,

606
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,639
...Colina, Paine, Lonquén,

607
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,959
Concepción, Temuco,

608
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,439
Punta Arenas...

609
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,919
These women's search never crossed
paths with that of the astronomers...

610
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,639
...who were tracking another
kind of body: celestial bodies.

611
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,119
Whilst these women
handled the desert matter...

612
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,399
...the astronomers discovered
that the earth's matter...

613
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,439
...was the same throughout the cosmos.

614
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,919
10,000 years ago, the first
inhabitants of Atacama...

615
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,599
...gathered the pebbles
washed up by the sea.

616
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,239
They also knew something of the stars...

617
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,799
...and they buried their dead at night.

618
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,199
Scientists collected the remains
of these men of antiquity...

619
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,839
...and classified them meticulously.

620
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,679
They studied them...

621
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,679
...like the pages of a unique book...

622
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,039
...and today preserve them like treasure.

623
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,439
When I was a child, my
mother took me to a museum...

624
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,759
...to see the skeleton of a whale.

625
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,119
I stayed for a long time...

626
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,359
...beneath this skeleton
that is still there today.

627
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,479
I imagined it was
the roof of a house...

628
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,079
...where other whales could live.

629
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,599
Today, there are other skeletons...

630
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,639
...that are not in a museum.

631
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,559
They are made of calcium,

632
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,599
...the same calcium that
stars are made of.

633
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,199
But unlike them,
they have no names.

634
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,359
We don't know which souls
they belonged to.

635
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,519
They are the remains of remains.

636
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,919
The remains of the disappeared
of the military dictatorship...

637
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,039
...that have not yet been identified.

638
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,639
I wonder...

639
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,159
...for how long they
will lie in these boxes.

640
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,719
Will they be placed
in a monument one day?

641
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:51,639
Will they have earned a
museum space like the whale?

642
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,999
Will they be given
a burial one day?

643
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:17,439
Valentina works for the leading
astronomy organisation in Chile.

644
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,719
Her grandfather taught
her to observe the sky...

645
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,599
...when she was a child.

646
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:29,199
She is married with two children.

647
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,719
In 1975, when she was one year old,

648
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,199
...she was detained with her
grandparents by Pinochet's police.

649
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,039
I am the daughter of detained
and disappeared parents.

650
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,799
First they detained my grandparents.

651
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,079
They were held for several hours.

652
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,719
They threatened them relentlessly...

653
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,879
...to make them reveal
where my parents were,

654
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,399
...or else I, too, would disappear.

655
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,319
With this threat,

656
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:13,279
...my grandparents took
them to where we lived.

657
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,719
After detaining my parents,

658
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,439
...they returned me to my
grandparents who brought me up.

659
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,239
Astronomy has somehow helped me...

660
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,199
...to give another dimension to the pain,

661
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,639
...to the absence,

662
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,399
...to the loss.

663
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,279
Sometimes, when one
is alone with that pain,

664
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,599
...and these moments are necessary,

665
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,959
...the pain becomes oppressive.

666
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,359
I tell myself it's all part of a cycle...

667
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,439
...which didn't begin
and won't end with me,

668
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,599
...nor with my parents,
or with my children.

669
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,519
I tell myself we are
all part of a current,

670
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,319
...of an energy, a recyclable matter.

671
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,599
Like the stars which must die...

672
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:23,479
...so that other stars can be
born, other planets, a new life.

673
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,359
In this context,

674
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,919
...what happened to my parents

675
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,439
...and their absence take
on another dimension.

676
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:41,159
It takes on another meaning
and frees me a little...

677
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,439
...from this great suffering,

678
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,679
...as I feel that nothing
really comes to an end.

679
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,759
My grandparents are
the happiness in my life.

680
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,359
Thanks to them, I've been
able to write my own story.

681
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,079
Not merely from a painful perspective...

682
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,519
...but also a joyful one,

683
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,399
...optimistic,

684
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,799
...driven by this strength
and the desire to progress.

685
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:31,999
My grandparents were wise...

686
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,159
...realising they had
a double responsibility.

687
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,679
They found a way...

688
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,399
...to make my parents important
reference points for me.

689
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,719
They passed on my parents'
values and their strength.

690
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,799
What is more, my grandparents
were able to overcome their pain...

691
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,399
...so that I could have...

692
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,759
...a happy and healthy childhood.

693
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,199
Sometimes I feel like...

694
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,719
...I'm a product with a
manufacturing defect...

695
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,959
...which is invisible.

696
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:20,359
I find it funny when people
tell me that it doesn't show...

697
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,919
...that I'm the daughter
of disappeared prisoners.

698
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,679
I realise that my children
don't have this defect.

699
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:33,639
Nor does my husband
and that makes me happy.

700
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,719
I am surrounded by people...

701
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,519
...who have no manufacturing defect.

702
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,999
I am happy that my son
is growing up like this.

703
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,799
Compared to the immensity
of the cosmos,

704
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,799
...the problems of the Chilean
people might seem insignificant.

705
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,639
But if we laid them out on a table,

706
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,959
...they would be as vast as a galaxy.

707
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,399
Whilst making this film, looking back,

708
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,839
...I found in these marbles...

709
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,319
...the innocence of the Chile
of my childhood.

710
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,199
Back then,

711
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:35,479
...each of us could carry
the entire universe...

712
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,719
...in the depths of our pockets.

713
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,679
I am convinced that memory
has a gravitational force.

714
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,599
It is constantly attracting us.

715
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,639
Those who have a memory...

716
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:13,519
...are able to live in the
fragile present moment.

717
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,479
Those who have none...

718
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,279
...don't live anywhere.

719
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:31,999
Each night, slowly, impassively,

720
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,799
...the centre of the galaxy
passes over Santiago.
