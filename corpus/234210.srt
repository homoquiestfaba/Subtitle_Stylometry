1
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,406
Manuel.

2
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,450
Manuel!

3
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,715
Manuel.

4
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,935
I think....

5
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,148
I think I found you one.

6
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,487
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,577
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

8
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,886
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,846
It's okay.

10
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,441
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:21,530
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,622
Sure.

13
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,812
What the hell?

14
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,039
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,209
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,920
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,143
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,563
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,357
Asshole.

20
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:43,529
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,697
- Chas!
- What?

22
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,534
- Move the car.
- Why?

23
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,370
Move the damn car!

24
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,582
"Chas, move the car. "

25
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,002
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,598
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,437
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,861
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,291
No!

30
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,340
Show yourself.

31
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,221
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,690
For your boss.

33
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,692
Pull it!

34
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,928
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,633
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,385
What happened in there?

37
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,686
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,896
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,358
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,444
I need some help, Father.

41
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,655
You do?

42
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,490
From me?

43
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,284
What kind of-?

44
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,415
- Hey, listen, I-
- That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,086
Listen to the ether.

46
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,465
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:55,804
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,934
A few days.

49
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,394
Okay.

50
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,856
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,529
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,157
- I told you to move it.
- You did tell me to move it...

53
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,660
...but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon...

54
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,579
...I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,249
- Take Alvarado.
- Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

56
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,129
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

57
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,547
- No?
- Nope.

58
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,007
Nope?

59
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,134
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,255
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

61
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,260
It's been...

62
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,305
...two weeks since my last confession.

63
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,644
I killed a man today.

64
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,313
Another one.

65
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,364
I didn't even see his face, I just...

66
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,617
...pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:47,708
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

68
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,754
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

69
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,133
Where to aim, when to fire.

70
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,512
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

71
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,223
Something damned?

72
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,520
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

73
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,900
You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

74
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,027
Yeah, I'm trying.

75
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,155
I'm trying real hard.

76
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,949
Isabel.

77
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,000
Isabel.

78
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,515
Things I've beaten.

79
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,227
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,689
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,984
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,738
Come on, Les.

83
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,157
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

84
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,076
This is aggressive.

85
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,164
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,209
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,920
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,674
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,932
- Make arrangements.
- No need.

90
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,101
I already know exactly where I'm going.

91
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,857
- Morning.
- Good morning.

92
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,818
- Good morning.
- Detective.

93
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,737
- No, no, no.
- Angela, wait.

94
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,490
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,034
Give us the room, please.

96
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,941
Isabel.

97
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,575
She fell from the roof?

98
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,493
She jumped.

99
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,122
- No.
- Look...

100
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,293
...I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

101
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,846
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- Angie.

102
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,432
- She wouldn't kill herself.
- Detective.

103
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,892
- Period.
- Detective.

104
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,602
Period!

105
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,148
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,452
- Hold the door. You going down?
- Not if I can help it.

107
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,585
A new case?

108
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:29,299
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,344
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

110
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,602
Oh, yeah, that's-
Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,147
How you feeling, John?

112
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,899
So, what's new?

113
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,615
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope...

114
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,286
...holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan...

115
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:02,166
...and- Oh, you'll love this.
- screech beetle from Amityville.

116
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,172
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

117
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,300
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

118
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,261
I just like them.

119
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,221
Yeah. Who doesn't?

120
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,267
Yeah, easy there, hero.

121
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,896
- That's dragon's breath.
- I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

122
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:28,650
Yeah, well, I know a guy
who knows a guy.

123
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,993
So, what's the action?

124
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:42,080
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

125
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,209
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

126
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,128
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

127
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,464
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John...

128
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,965
...not doorways.

129
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:56,053
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

130
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,722
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

131
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,724
Sure thing, John.

132
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,352
Anything else?

133
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,438
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a-?

134
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,316
On the house.

135
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:13,654
All right, question. How much longer
do I have to be your slave, John?

136
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,616
You're not my slave, Chas.

137
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,328
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

138
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,539
Like Tonto or Robin.

139
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,291
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

140
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,170
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

141
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,591
John? John.

142
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,345
I love our little talks, John.

143
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,151
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

144
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,988
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

145
00:19:56,154 --> 00:20:00,534
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

146
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,120
I really need to speak with him.
It's important.

147
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,873
First come, first served.

148
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,879
So you're rude no matter where you are.

149
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,055
- Father.
- Hi.

150
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,143
- You have news. Yes.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

151
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,484
I know what you want, son.

152
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,030
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

153
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,492
I'm flattered.

154
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,745
Well, I could offer something...

155
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,999
...about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock...

156
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,168
...but it might sound disingenuous.

157
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,962
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

158
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:58,175
- Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
- She didn't commit suicide.

159
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,844
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

160
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,971
Oh, rules.

161
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,932
Father.

162
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,600
David.

163
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,020
This is Isabel.

164
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:13,815
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

165
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,318
Please.

166
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,779
I'm sorry.

167
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,868
I've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

168
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,663
You might consider
giving me an extension.

169
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,290
I could do your side some good
these days.

170
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,626
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

171
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,380
What about the minions I've sent back?

172
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:40,551
- That alone should guarantee my entry.
- How many times have I told you?

173
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,636
That's not the way this works.

174
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,389
Why, haven't I served him enough?

175
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,142
- What does he want from me?
- Only the usual.

176
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,271
Self-sacrifice, belief.

177
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,524
- Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
- No, no, you know.

178
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,818
And there's a difference. You've seen.

179
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:02,489
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

180
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,616
A gift, John.

181
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,202
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

182
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,747
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

183
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,666
Who's that for?

184
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,171
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

185
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,506
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

186
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,176
Impossible rules, endless regulations...

187
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:26,305
...who goes up, who goes down
and why.

188
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,103
You don't even understand us.

189
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,273
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

190
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,412
Why me, Gabriel?

191
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,082
It's personal, isn't it?

192
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,713
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough...

193
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:04,176
...I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

194
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,722
You are going to die young...

195
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,643
...because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

196
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,562
And you're going to go to hell...

197
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,649
...because of the life you took.

198
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,239
You're fucked.

199
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,710
At least it's nice out.

200
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:44,341
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

201
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,183
And his punch lines are killers.

202
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,566
John!

203
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:04,695
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

204
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,252
Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.

205
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,964
So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...

206
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,466
Police report she had been
physically penetrated...

207
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,261
...over 100 times and buried alive.

208
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:33,015
- found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs...

209
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,933
He stuffed Holly's body into...

210
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,896
- The bodies ravished by the unknown...
- He used a small handsaw...

211
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,399
Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.

212
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,151
Isabel.

213
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,176
I'm so sorry, Izzy.

214
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,303
Constantine.

215
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,838
Dodson.

216
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,714
Hello?

217
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,092
Hello.

218
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,015
Hello?

219
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,786
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

220
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:33,529
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

221
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,637
I know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

222
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,389
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

223
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:04,184
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

224
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,979
- You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
- It's a bar?

225
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,358
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

226
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,027
- John, the man's a legend.
- Yeah.

227
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,572
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

228
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,240
I'm begging you, John, please?

229
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,451
- Sure, you can get in.
- I can get in?

230
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,704
If you can get in.

231
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:28,000
If I can get-? It's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

232
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,505
Two frogs on a bench.

233
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,553
Two frogs on a bench.

234
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,638
No, no, I'm with the guy you just-

235
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,599
John! John!

236
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,684
I'm with him, though.

237
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,645
Rat in a dress.

238
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,024
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

239
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,067
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

240
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,913
Don't get up.

241
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,416
You've been absent some time.

242
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,461
Have you come here with relics to sell?

243
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:57,923
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

244
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,802
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

245
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,846
Midnite, Jesus...

246
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,266
...I thought the thing was authentic.

247
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,728
I see now.

248
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:15,065
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

249
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,942
A few months, maybe a year.

250
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,695
I thought I heard thunder last night.

251
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,823
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

252
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,952
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

253
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,329
So I've heard.

254
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,666
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here...

255
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,878
...for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

256
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,717
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

257
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,052
They don't like you, John.

258
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,013
How many have you
deported back to hell?

259
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,517
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

260
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,312
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

261
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,731
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon...

262
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,275
...trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

263
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:02,988
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven...

264
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:05,574
...the great détente
of the original superpowers.

265
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:10,496
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

266
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,164
Now...

267
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,626
...I need to use the chair.

268
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:23,091
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you...

269
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,927
...you know I am neutral.

270
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:29,139
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

271
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,809
Before you were a bartender...

272
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:37,147
...you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

273
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,859
- And I-
- You were Constantine.

274
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,279
The John Constantine.

275
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,615
Once.

276
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,203
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

277
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,664
Something's coming.

278
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,375
Spooky.

279
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,293
Balthazar.

280
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,339
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

281
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,383
I'll make your night.

282
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,095
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

283
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,351
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

284
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,395
Johnny boy.

285
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,818
Word is you're on your way down.

286
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,070
Fresh meat.

287
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:30,450
Finger-licking good.

288
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,536
We have a meeting now, John.

289
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,421
What? I didn't catch that.

290
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,340
Welcome to my life.

291
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:36,808
Mr. Constantine.

292
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,146
- I saw you-
- I remember.

293
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,650
- And then I saw you at the-
- Regular kismet.

294
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:49,154
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

295
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,282
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

296
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,993
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

297
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,204
Please?

298
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,751
Always a catch.

299
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,601
My sister was murdered yesterday.

300
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:22,604
- Sorry to hear.
- Thanks.

301
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,651
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

302
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,154
Thought you said she was murdered.

303
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,198
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

304
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:36,869
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

305
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,830
That's just crazy.

306
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,379
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

307
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:52,551
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

308
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:56,180
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

309
00:34:56,346 --> 00:35:00,893
She started talking about demons,
angels.

310
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,687
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

311
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:07,482
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

312
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:11,904
Some kind of legion or cult.

313
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,907
Sounds like a theory, detective.

314
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,450
Good luck.

315
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,121
I thought with your background,
you could at least...

316
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,873
...point me in the right direction.

317
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,250
Yeah, okay, sure.

318
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,380
It wasn't a suicide.

319
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,633
My sister was a devout Catholic.

320
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,177
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life-

321
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:38,013
Her soul would go straight to hell...

322
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,101
...where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony...

323
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:46,396
...for all eternity. That it?

324
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,524
That about right?

325
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:57,241
Goddamn you.

326
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,771
Detective.

327
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,649
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager...

328
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:34,153
...a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

329
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,697
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

330
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:40,993
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

331
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:45,372
- Just influence. See who would win.
- Okay, I'm humoring you.

332
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,499
- Why?
- Who knows.

333
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,627
- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
- Oh, so it's fun.

334
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:55,591
It's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

335
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:59,344
And you think the devil is responsible?

336
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,139
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

337
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:05,642
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

338
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,396
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

339
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:12,858
Well, this has been real educational...

340
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,693
...but I don't believe in the devil.

341
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,155
You should. He believes in you.

342
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,593
It's a power outage.

343
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,637
Not likely.

344
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:47,434
- What?
- We should go. Now.

345
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,274
What is that?

346
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,985
Wings.

347
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:59,780
Maybe talons.

348
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:02,699
You're kidding. Of what?

349
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,578
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

350
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,835
That's really not going to help.

351
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,800
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

352
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,218
Suit yourself.

353
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,826
Demons stay in hell, huh?

354
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,121
Tell them that.

355
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:55,836
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

356
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,046
It's the sulfur.

357
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,507
Sulfur.

358
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,928
What were those things?

359
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,890
Demons.

360
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:13,812
- Scavengers of the damned.
- No, no. It's impossible.

361
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:17,649
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

362
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,613
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

363
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,114
Isabel?

364
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,867
Never in a million years.

365
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:29,244
Well, let's be sure.

366
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,830
Let's see if she's in hell.

367
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,397
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

368
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,900
In front of the chair.

369
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,446
I can't believe I'm doing this.

370
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,115
- These are all Isabel's things?
- Yeah.

371
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,035
- How about the cat?
- Duck?

372
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,704
Yeah, why?

373
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,998
Duck.

374
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,376
Oh, you think that's strange.

375
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:18,961
Cats are good.

376
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:20,671
Half in, half out anyway.

377
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,316
If this is some kind of spell
or something...

378
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,528
...don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

379
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:46,905
Why, do you have any?

380
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:50,033
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

381
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,664
I need you to leave.

382
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,209
- I'm sorry?
- Angela, please.

383
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,215
The apartment.

384
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,927
Okay.

385
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:17,436
Be careful with that cat.

386
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,984
God, I hate this part.

387
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,479
- Isabel.
- Constantine.

388
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,525
Angela.

389
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,321
Jesus.

390
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,035
- Constantine, what-?
- Twins.

391
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:22,037
Jesus. What?

392
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:25,290
- You were twins.
- What did you say?

393
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,043
- She killed herself.
- What?

394
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,630
And she's damned for it.

395
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,769
How is this possible?

396
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,940
I need to eat.

397
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:35,671
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

398
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,384
Relax, man.

399
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:42,719
Slow down!

400
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,786
What the hell kind of place is this?

401
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,045
John.

402
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,953
When I was a kid, I could see things.

403
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,413
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

404
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,668
Things you shouldn't have to see.

405
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,689
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

406
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:01,233
They made it worse.

407
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,280
You think you're crazy long enough...

408
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:07,990
...you find a way out.

409
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:12,077
- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.

410
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:18,667
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

411
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:21,837
But when you cross over...

412
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:25,174
...time stops.

413
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,303
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

414
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,348
When I came back...

415
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:36,935
...I knew...

416
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,897
...all the things I could see were real.

417
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:46,069
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

418
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:51,033
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

419
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:54,578
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

420
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:57,539
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

421
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,792
The influence peddlers.

422
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:06,173
They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...

423
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,219
...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

424
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:13,305
Those with the demon's touch...

425
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:18,310
...like those part angel,
living alongside us.

426
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,854
They call it the balance.

427
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:24,274
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

428
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:28,237
So when a half-breed breaks the rules...

429
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:32,491
...I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

430
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,619
I don't get them all...

431
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:39,915
...but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

432
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,752
- ...retirement.
- I don't understand.

433
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:47,756
I'm a suicide, Angela.

434
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:51,301
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

435
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:53,428
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

436
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:56,014
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison...

437
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,433
...where half the inmates
were put there by you?

438
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:03,147
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

439
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:06,567
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

440
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,694
He's not planning anything.

441
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,946
When we were little...

442
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:14,408
...Isabel saw things too.

443
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,956
Dodson.

444
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:26,795
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

445
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:29,923
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

446
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,177
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

447
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,263
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

448
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,517
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

449
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:42,227
He's okay.

450
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,781
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

451
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:29,691
Yes?

452
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:32,361
What do you mean?

453
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,655
What?

454
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,323
How?

455
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:50,337
Got it. Bye.

456
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:59,471
I need to see where Isabel died.

457
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:02,683
Séances, Ouija boards, channeling.

458
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:06,728
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

459
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:09,314
She certainly did that.

460
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:12,860
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

461
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:16,572
She'd scare my mother half to death.

462
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:20,868
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

463
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,203
So you had her committed.

464
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,621
Yeah.

465
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:26,373
How long?

466
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,417
Two weeks.

467
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:30,544
This time.

468
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:35,132
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

469
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,512
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand...

470
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,890
...does it have something to do
with this?

471
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,350
I'm a cop, John, remember?

472
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:50,272
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

473
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:55,110
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

474
00:53:55,277 --> 00:54:00,407
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

475
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,577
Something just for you.

476
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:09,082
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

477
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:12,419
- I'm not like my sister.
- But you were once.

478
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,713
When you were kids.

479
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,674
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

480
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:21,428
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

481
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,013
That was a long time ago.

482
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,057
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

483
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:27,184
There is nothing here.

484
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:30,813
- Hey. Come on.
- She planned her death in this room.

485
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:34,233
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

486
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:37,528
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw...

487
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:40,572
...feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

488
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:43,492
- What did she do, Angela?
- How should I know?

489
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:45,953
- What did she do, Angela?
- I don't know.

490
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:50,290
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

491
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:55,003
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

492
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,298
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

493
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,717
- What did she do?
- I don't know!

494
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:19,778
When we were girls...

495
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:25,367
...we would leave each other messages.

496
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,705
In light.

497
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:33,959
In breath.

498
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,590
On the windows.

499
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:46,889
John, there is no 17th act
in Corinthians.

500
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:52,561
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

501
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:55,772
They have Bibles in hell.

502
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:58,650
Paints a different view of Revelations.

503
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:00,861
Says the world will not end
by God's hand...

504
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,906
...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

505
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,532
Though if you ask me...

506
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,993
...fire's fire.

507
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,247
16:29, 16:30.

508
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:16,251
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

509
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,130
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son. "

510
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:24,092
- Whose son?
- But he can't cross over, B.

511
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,803
- Impossible to cross over.
- Whose son? God's son?

512
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,265
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

513
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:32,059
Here it is.

514
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:34,186
This is the sign of Mammon...

515
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:38,649
...the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here-
