THE LITTLE TRAITOR

2
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:02,723
<i>From 1917 to 1948,
Palestine was ruled... </i>

3
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:04,672
<i>by orders of the British Mandate. </i>

4
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:07,122
<i>After the Second World War,
the British tried to reduce... </i>

5
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,538
<i>the number of refugees from
post- Holocaust in Palestine. </i>

6
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,875
<i>As a result,
the National Military Organization... </i>

7
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,824
<i>and the Haganah used
armed resistance. </i>

8
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,553
<i>To halt the violence,
the British ordered... </i>

9
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:17,246
<i>a nightly curfew for
the Arab and Jewish communities. </i>

10
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,201
JERUSALEM, 1947

11
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:25,536
<i>Curfew.
Curfew. </i>

12
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:28,705
<i>Curfew.
Attention. </i>

13
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,293
<i>Everyone should be home
after 18h. </i>

14
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:32,993
<i>Curfew. </i>

15
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,232
<i>Who is found
after 17h, will be arrested. </i>

16
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:39,556
<i>Everyone should be home
after 18h. </i>

17
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,531
<i>- Stop!
Attention-.</i>

18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,518
- Stop!
- Here!

19
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,203
<i>Who is found
after 17h, will be arrested. </i>

20
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,580
<i>- Freeze!
- Curfew. </i>

21
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,244
- You come with me!
- Easy.

22
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,192
<i>Attention. </i>

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,028
Can not get that close
the curfew, Proffy.

24
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:18,817
Could have been arrested.

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,914
- Sorry, Papa.
- We have many concerns.

26
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,812
- I'm no longer holding me back.
- You're right.

27
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,754
It will not be late again.

28
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:30,273
Proffy, we were worried.
Glad you came.

29
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,057
Go to your room
and stay there until dinner.

30
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:37,218
<i>Our strength moves
against the British defenses. </i>

31
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:41,380
<i>Their commander ordered
prepare to fight</i>

32
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,616
<i>soldiers, preparing to shoot</i>

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,828
<i>Fire. Stop them.
Stop the poppy pathetic. </i>

34
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:51,617
Kill the British.

35
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,652
Dear listeners,
here is the Voice of Jerusalem...

36
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:56,993
with important news.

37
00:02:57,028 --> 00:03:00,932
In the middle of the night, Palestine
initiated the attack...

38
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,849
and expelled all British of Israel.

39
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:06,308
- Proffy, what are you doing?
- Nothing, Ima. Just reading my book.

40
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,385
- What book?
From school.

41
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,355
- Come, dinner is on the table.
- Coming.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,137
<i>Dear listeners... </i>

43
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:17,844
<i>here is the Voice of Jerusalem
with important news. </i>

44
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,637
<i>Five men were arrested
stealing weapons and ammunition. </i>

45
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:23,396
<i>They are suspected of belonging
an illegal organization. </i>

46
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:26,337
<i>In special meeting UN... </i>

47
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,420
<i>what happened yesterday,
a committee was set up... </i>

48
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:29,953
<i>will receive the name UNSCOP... </i>

49
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:31,679
<i>Special Committee of the UN
to Palestine. </i>

50
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,460
Would not have a state
without the help of the world.

51
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:38,980
- Why all hate the Jews?
- We know a lot.

52
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,993
So we should perhaps not
know much.

53
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:44,676
The reasons for the hate may change,
but they will hate us forever.

54
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,629
- What should we do?
- Must be different.

55
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,097
And do not hate.

56
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:49,313
But as not hate the British?

57
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:53,412
Are terrible.
- We know people worse.

58
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:54,722
Well, I do not know.

59
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:57,313
I do not know anyone
worse than the British.

60
00:03:57,348 --> 00:04:01,029
The important thing is resisted.
Weakness is sin.

61
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,484
And also wasteful.
Eat your dinner.

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,657
- I wish I could...
- Do not talk with mouth full.

63
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,148
I have to age
into the movement.

64
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,741
Not think about it.

65
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,964
Who is our home
in the middle of the night?

66
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:22,689
Nobody.

67
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:25,026
Nobody? I hear things.

68
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,204
People talking
and dragging the furniture.

69
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,611
I said. Nobody.

70
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,162
I can leave?

71
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,847
Please take a few things
Mr Lazarus on the roof.

72
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:40,933
Ludmilla, you were
good chicken today.

73
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:43,551
Put three eggs for me.

74
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:47,653
You make all the time noise, Olga,

75
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,507
and gave no eggs.

76
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,419
Hi, Mr. Lazarus.

77
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,625
Proffy, you scared us.

78
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,917
Sorry, Mr. Lazarus.
My mother send you this.

79
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:01,088
- Thanks.
A pair needs a new button.

80
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,910
And also this.

81
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,490
His mother is a good woman.

82
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:11,260
Okay, girls, <i>Gute Nacht. </i>

83
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:15,808
Will the British spy?

84
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,908
Tell me where you
the next inspection, please.

85
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:22,756
In Haifa, a 48 km.

86
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:26,139
Here.
Go here.

87
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,081
What is it?

88
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,843
Hi, Papa.

89
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:27,900
I am working.
Don't disturb me.

<i>But they are
all the time in the room?</i>

147
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,176
<i>When. </i>

148
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:32,934
<i>I think my mom

<i>- Curfew.
- Curfew. </i>

152
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:15,334
Slow down, boy.
Your destiny is in my hands.

153
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,859
Did you know that has passed
the curfew?

154
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,066
- And you violated the rules.
- Of course not.

155
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:23,905
Why is delayed?

156
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,436
Has passed the curfew.

157
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,422
Where was going?
It is coming?

158
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:30,339
For the city
seek remedies...

159
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,927
- for a sick man.
- And as he calls?

160
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,641
- David.
- Who is he?

161
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,091
Why need medication?

162
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,810
- David, my father.
- And what's with him?

163
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:43,110
- It has malaria.
- Your father has malaria?

164
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:44,708
I should arrest you.

165
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:46,823
- I am not afraid of prison.
- No?

166
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,868
And the gallows
and guillotine?

167
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:51,796
I do not know what they are,
but not afraid.

168
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,690
Let's find out now.
Come with me, you're stuck.

169
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,665
Keep going.
Faster, faster, come on.

170
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:17,020
- Where do you live?
- Beyond.

171
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,404
Then we come back, come on.

172
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,860
- Back?
- This is for your home.

173
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,756
Come to my house?

174
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,807
I can not do it
without telling their parents.

175
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,051
Marching.

176
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:28,131
Come on.

177
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,039
I am Stephen Dunlop...

178
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,214
of Canterbury.

179
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,327
Where is it?

180
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,910
A 95 km from London.

181
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:17,442
- Who are you, boy?
- Proffy Leibowitz.

182
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:20,670
- I am a Jew from Eretz Israel.
- Yes...

183
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,814
I'm sure you are.

184
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,471
In the second book
Samuel the prophet is writing...

185
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,739
"and the boy was a boy. "

186
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,191
You know our Book of Samuel?

187
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,109
Of course.

188
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,598
My father was a minister.

189
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,214
You have the same
Book of Samuel did we do?

190
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,117
It belongs to us.

191
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,085
So...

192
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:56,039
- what kind of name is Proffy?
- Is short for professor.

193
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,773
Call me this because
I think smart.

194
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:01,473
- And you are?
- I was not much today.

195
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,566
- This is your house?
- Yes.

196
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,213
Why not take me
straight to prison?

197
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,134
I get it.

198
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:39,393
The worst punishment the waiting inside.

199
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,012
You can go, boy.

200
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:46,081
- It will not arrest me?
- No, not this time.

201
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:47,973
But I do it the next time...

202
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,790
- If you have not learned the lesson.
- I learned, sir.

203
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,638
What is waiting?

204
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,182
Thank you.

205
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,749
No, no 'thank you'.

206
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,462
Meet the Oriental Palace?

207
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:15,777
I...

208
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,793
I'm almost there
every afternoon.

209
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,844
No coffee.

210
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,845
Come on, boy.

211
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,623
- Sorry, I...
- I feel.

212
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:45,252
See what happened in Haifa?

213
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,176
A boy of his age
left in retreat...

214
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,709
and the British beat him.

215
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:51,013
Parents found him
in a Arabic hospital.

216
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:53,224
Will not leave the room
until the end of the week.

217
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,079
- Just go to the bathroom.
- What?

218
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,325
Dining alone...

219
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,888
and take a long time to
think about what happened...

220
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,389
and what could have happened.

221
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:02,912
And will be no allowance
until September.

222
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,202
Now go to your room.

223
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:43,687
<i>BoKer Tov. </i>

224
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,656
Do not step on my army.

225
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:51,077
- How many days remaining?
- Three.

226
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:54,275
Three more days?
I will die in this room.

227
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,932
How is the world outside?

228
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,397
How to listen
the birds singing?

229
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:04,136
E- see flowers, trees, hills?
- You see it soon.

230
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:05,989
Got a breakfast
well good.

231
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:08,568
I thought we had left
to be free of Eretz.

232
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:11,183
- I am not free!
- Must follow the rules...

233
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,763
may not end up as
a chicken without head.

234
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,385
Proffy...

235
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,839
we love you.

236
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,845
<i>Soldiers. </i>

237
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,914
<i>Tonight hold a battle
particularly decisive. </i>

238
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,380
<i>It is possible that we
to suffer heavy casualties. </i>

239
00:19:57,545 --> 00:20:02,727
<i>attack by the Battalion air
1, 2, 3, fire. </i>

240
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:10,946
<i>Fire. </i>

241
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:19,656
<i>Please enter.
You can enter. </i>

242
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,573
Thank you for
let us sleep here.

243
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,608
- It is the least we can do.
- They must be hungry.

244
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,597
- Sit down.
- Where do you live?

245
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:29,666
- Hungary.
- How many were in the boat?

246
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,248
<i>Was empty. </i>

247
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:33,605
Glad I succeeded.

248
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,464
- It is a miracle.
- Thanks.

249
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,253
But, take care...
- Thanks.

250
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:39,592
If the British to get,
will send you back.

251
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:40,934
Who's here?

252
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,935
What is that noise?

253
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:47,908
What's going on here?

254
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,753
This is my house too.

255
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,337
Proffy.

256
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:56,863
It is very important
to be quiet now.

257
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:58,307
Be quiet.

258
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,399
I wish you'd take me in the prison.

259
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,423
- It's time.
- Finally.

260
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,790
<i>Let me out, Dady. <i/>

261
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,781
Finally out of the cage.
Want to eat?

262
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,896
I do not want to eat, Ima.
I just want to go outside.

263
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,766
I hope I have not
more problems, Proffy...

264
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:46,025
and has learned the lesson.

265
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,750
Learned, for sure.

266
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,152
- Can I quit now?
- Go.

267
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,129
<i>A full week
locked in the room?</i>

268
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:58,787
<i>seemed a year. </i>

269
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,892
<i>As his father was
do that to you?</i>

270
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:05,886
<i>None of my parents
dare I do this. </i>

271
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,269
<i>This is not surprising... </i>

272
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:09,955
<i>are locked in a room
with his mother all the time. </i>

273
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:12,008
<i>I would have fled. </i>

274
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:14,561
<i>I, if I could. </i>

275
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,801
<i>I have something important
to talk. </i>

276
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,681
<i>More importantly
that Operation Nails?</i>

277
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:21,798
<i>Maybe. </i>

278
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,655
<i>I discovered a vital source
intelligence. </i>

279
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,477
<i>I ask permission to
followed with espionage. </i>

280
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:28,326
<i>We need more details. </i>

281
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:31,737
<i>Can not yet disclose.
This jeopardize the mission. </i>

282
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:35,113
<i>Do not forget that I,
as commander in chief... </i>

283
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:36,358
<i>must always be informed. </i>

284
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:39,841
<i>I pass the information, if any. </i>

285
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:46,310
<i>Hello, Proffy, how are you</i>

286
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:49,481
<i>- I run.
- Where you been all this time?</i>

287
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:50,918
<i>Busy-.
- Let's talk. </i>

288
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,449
<i>- We of his company. Today
- I... </i>

289
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:54,790
<i>I am in a hurry. </i>

290
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:07,429
Hey, man. You got a light?

291
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:16,743
I told him,
I will not do that.

292
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:19,525
- I do not blame.
- Of course not.

293
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,038
Sergeant Dunlop of Canterbury?

294
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:36,320
- It's Proffy.
- Of course.

295
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:39,530
What took so to visit me?

296
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,318
I was stuck at home.

297
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:44,522
How is malaria of your dad?
- Better.

298
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:45,536
Good.

299
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:47,561
Why not sit down, boy?

300
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:52,489
You are reading our
Book of Samuel?

301
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,050
Yes, I am.

302
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:57,470
- You like to study Hebrew?
- Not really.

303
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,974
I'm trying to learn.

304
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,697
It makes sense to stay
so much time here...

305
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:04,224
without learning the local language.

306
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:08,649
- You study Samuel?
- I have to study in school.

307
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:11,402
- And?
- I prefer comic books.

308
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,743
Undoubtedly.

309
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,214
I have a question for you.

310
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,737
- In Samuel II...
- Why so much like to read Samuel?

311
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:19,815
- It is so boring.
- Boring?

312
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,119
Boy, this is the beginning
of the monarchy.

313
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:25,065
If you understand the words,
will understand the concepts.

314
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,882
For example, see:
Chapter 3, verse 1.

315
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:28,839
"Extend to a long...

316
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:31,658
the war between the house
of Saul and of David.

317
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:34,633
But as the power
David went up from fortified...

318
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:37,573
the house of Saul would be
increasingly weakening. "

319
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,207
Yeah, so?

320
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:41,314
What is the word
to 'undermine'?

321
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,942
- This, <i>daleem. </i>
- <i>Daleem</i>, it.

322
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:48,617
According to my trusty dictionary,
<i>daleem</i> can be...

323
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:50,471
- Poor.
- Exactly.

324
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:52,586
So being poor
means also to be weak?

325
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:54,666
Yes, according to their language.

326
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,327
I don't like it.

327
00:25:56,362 --> 00:26:00,426
We are a bit poor,
but we are not weak.

328
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:02,182
Yes, I can see that.

329
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:06,759
- You are Israeli?
- Yes.

330
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:10,762
Actually, my mother said
I am shocked in Poland...

331
00:26:10,797 --> 00:26:12,391
but I just left the egg here.

332
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:14,760
She loves to
references chickens.

333
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,922
Really?
Then you are Polish?

334
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:21,770
No, just my parents.

335
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:27,459
You British- born?
- Sure.

336
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:31,751
Well, I loved the visit,
but gotta go now.

337
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:34,889
- I have a report to do.
- Really? What kind of report?

338
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:36,831
It is a secret business.

339
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,910
You come visit me again?

340
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:42,179
I do not know.

341
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:44,358
Maybe not.

342
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:47,274
- When can I come?
- Tomorrow, at the same time.

343
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,859
I'll visit tomorrow.

344
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:51,398
Good day, Proffy.

345
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:53,670
Good day.

346
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,066
<i>Have problems
with the British?</i>

347
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,473
<i>Not, they come from Europe. </i>

348
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:13,571
<i>The boat will get at
4 in the morning. </i>

349
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,639
<i>We find them and hide them here. </i>

350
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:20,865
Got blankets and pillows.
- Thanks.

351
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,007
<i>I am not very confident. </i>

352
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,586
We plan this for days.
Just going to sleep a few hours.

353
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:30,244
Sleep thinking about it...

354
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:34,248
no one else will kill
or humiliate the Jews.

355
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,937
Come on, boy. It's your turn.

356
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,713
Put your hand here.
Open your fingers.

357
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:53,888
And hold on it.

358
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,202
A little down. So.

359
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:57,478
Keep strong.

360
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,272
You can go.

361
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:00,679
Very good!

362
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:10,369
- Who is that?
- A friend.

363
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:13,285
Do not have bombs hidden?

364
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:16,613
Hardly.

365
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:23,907
Come on.

366
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:27,201
You see a green ball?
Try to hit it.

367
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:34,303
Just. Nice try.

368
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,842
I am not very good
in that game.

369
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:40,906
- What do you call it?
- Snooker.

370
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:43,432
'Snooker', word crazy.

371
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,803
And that one that said,
indudi...

372
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:48,105
- Undoubtedly.
- Exactly.

373
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,570
Words are really stupid.

374
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,647
- "Parva?"
- Crazy.

375
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:55,114
<i>- Mishugah.
- Mishugah?</i>

376
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:56,576
Parva.

377
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:02,916
Yes, the snooker is undoubtedly
parva and <i>mishugah. </i>

378
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:10,049
- You are good at that?
- I'm good in school.

379
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:14,016
I am good at thinking.
In riddles.

380
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,158
At war strategies.
- Strategy of war?

381
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:22,154
So, wants to be a soldier?
- I would rather be the general.

382
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:24,707
Everything has to be
a general one day.

383
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:28,395
- Someone in your family do it?
- Nobody.

384
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,498
My only family are my mom and dad.

385
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,735
The Nazis killed everyone.

386
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:36,672
Sorry.

387
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:41,057
My father does not talk about it,
but my mother told me everything.

388
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:46,952
I had grandparents, uncles and aunts.

389
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:50,469
My father had
a younger brother...

390
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:55,266
He tried to escape with us,
but he was caught and killed.

391
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:59,842
I sometimes think my father
likes to be sad...

392
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:02,913
to compensate
the death of his brother.

393
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:06,313
Do you have big family?

394
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:10,599
Not realy.

395
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:14,943
I have a sister in Manchester.
My mother is in Canterbury.

396
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:17,249
And some cousins
in Southampton.

397
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,328
Listen...

398
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:24,267

about the Book of Samuel II?

<i>Lamah lo. </i>

00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:28,325
<i>Sure?</i>

401
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,991
- What do you think?
- It's a lot of funny.

402
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,303
No, my bishop!

403
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,497

00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,200
Good.

407
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:15,977

408
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:23,765
<i>- Hishtakfut.

411
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,240
And after that...

00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:46,403
got the Turks,
at the end of World War...

413
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:49,189
Hello, Sergeant.

414
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:53,291
Meet the League of Nations?
- No.

415
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,179
Are in favor of...

416
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,187

417
00:31:58,222 --> 00:31:59,496
why we are here.

418
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,432
Hello, how are you?

419
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:06,683
Are the Hochbergs.
<i>Oleem Chadashim. </i>

420
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,899
Passed in Cyprus for some time,
But Hungary.

421
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:12,392
This is my husband
and my son, Proffy.

422
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:15,013
The son of them is Miklos,
and a daughter...?

423
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:16,425
Rachel.

424
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,695
Go, children.
Go dancing.

425
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:45,896
Who died?

426
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,579
Someone from Hagan.

427
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:50,980
Murdered by the British.

428
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,408
<i>HaKshivu, HaKshivu.
Attention. </i>

429
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:07,113
<i>stay in their homes.
We do revised without notice. </i>

430
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:09,667
<i>HaKshivu, attention. </i>

431
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:12,934
<i>HaKshivu, HaKshivu. </i>

432
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:15,552
<i>Open. </i>

433
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,562
<i>- Who is it?
- Open the door. </i>

434
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,673
What's happening?
Why are you here?

435
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,884
<i>We have order to search your house. </i>

436
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,826
At least they are not speaking German.

437
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:27,691
- Can I help you?
- Excuse me, please.

438
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,001
Okay. Come.

439
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,465
Good morning to you too.

440
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:40,169
Stay right where you are.

441
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:42,603
- Take a cup of tea?
- Thanks, but I'm on duty.

442
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:44,491
<i>What do you think you are doing?</i>

443
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:54,406
- What is with so many books?
- Reviews and a schooler.

444
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:05,729
Are you hidding any radio equipment?

445
00:34:06,572 --> 00:34:07,717
No.

446
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:24,233
Hey.

447
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,244
Peter, look.

448
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:45,027
- What is this?
- My toys.

449
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,076
- You are making fun of us?
- 'makin'?

450
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:10,435
Is what you want do with us?

451
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:38,374
Did you sent them?

452
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:41,068
- What are you talking about?
- Did you do talk to someone...

453
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,988
soldiers searches to our house?

454
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,169
Of course not.

455
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:46,204
The soldiers came
and searched everywhere!

456
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,205
Two of our men
fell into an ambush...

457
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,257
and were killed.

458
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,537
Since then
take certain initiatives...

459
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:52,137
searched the houses,
looking for weapons...

460
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:55,148
Why are you here?
Why do you occupy our country?

461
00:35:55,183 --> 00:35:56,810
Why not go away?

462
00:35:56,845 --> 00:36:00,012
You could be occupied by country
worse than mine.

463
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,180
Why do not you leave
the Jews to return home?

464
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:05,351
- Come here.
- What is his problem?

465
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:07,394
What abused. Jewish.

466
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,668
Do you think I myself
dictates the rules here?

467
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:16,873
But could not
be shocked by this?

468
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,532
You know, Proffy,
try keep the peace here.

469
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,713
That's not true.

470
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:22,441
I should not have been
talk to you.

471
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:24,898
Should not have been here.
You are evil!

472
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,442
<i>So be on Tuesday?</i>

473
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,385
<i>- Why on Tuesday?
- A day of luck. </i>

474
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:56,361
<i>- Who says?
It's Bible- ... </i>

475
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:59,244
<i>twice, on Tuesday, says:
'And God saw that it was good. '</i>

476
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:04,936
<i>Want to do something
which is the Bible?</i>

477
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:07,970
<i>And Tuesday is when go
with trucks. </i>

478
00:37:08,044 --> 00:37:11,945
<i>would not bring us
secret information?</i>

479
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,468
<i>- I am working on it.
- What is investigating?</i>

480
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:18,092
<i>Can not keep a secret. </i>

481
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,210
<i>Chita is right. </i>

482
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,962
<i>Confidence is key in F.O.D.</i>

483
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:23,813
<i>It?</i>

484
00:37:24,428 --> 00:37:26,600
<i>Combined,
will be next Tuesday. </i>

485
00:37:27,821 --> 00:37:30,188
<i>And if we attack 10 minutes
before curfew?</i>

486
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:32,605
<i>still have time
to reach our homes. </i>

487
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,790
<i>Someone can see us,
yet be clear. </i>

488
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:36,940
<i>But in another time,
all trucks... </i>

489
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,410
<i>be in retreat. </i>

490
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:39,724
<i>It is a very important mission... </i>

491
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,091
<i>to just one
or two trucks. </i>

492
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:46,700
<i>- He is right.
- Tuesday, at 18.45.</i>

493
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:47,625
- F.
- O.

494
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,115
- D.
- Freedom or Death!

495
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:44,907
See who appeared!

496
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:46,444
I missed you.

497
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:50,541
- You will kill someone?
- I pray to God to never need.

498
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:51,946
Tell me, how are you?

499
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:54,600
<i>- Tov Li. </i> and you?
- How have been?

500
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:56,009
Very well.

501
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,933
Guess what
I read yesterday night.

502
00:39:57,968 --> 00:40:00,355
- What?
- Maimonides.

503
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,461
And Maimonides says...
- Sergeant Dunlop...

504
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:06,120
you have a wife?

505
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:09,197
I have no wife.
I have a girlfriend.

506
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:10,855
It is called Priscilla.

507
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:12,685
But I do not know
if I can count on that...

508
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,595
long distance.

509
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:16,652
What does she look like?

510
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,942
She reminds me
Kathryn Grayson, the actress.

511
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,571
You know?

512
00:40:22,606 --> 00:40:25,080
No, but I know
the Humphrey Bogart.

513
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:27,554
She does not seem
with Humphrey Bogart.

514
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,276
How does she look like?

515
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:38,731
Well..

516
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:44,391
she has dark hair,
brown eyes...

517
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:52,969
She is great? Lean? Fat?

518
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,482
She is small and very trimp.

519
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,846
- You have a girlfriend?
- Not exactly.

520
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,373
And you have one?

521
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,489
I think so.

522
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:11,629
It is like visiting a country
which never was.

523
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,996
Interested in 'travel', then?

524
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:17,866
Yes, I remember.
Was 11 years...

525
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:20,040
when started
I am interested in 'travel'.

526
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:23,976
- She looks to you?
- No, it is in my neighborhood.

527
00:41:24,494 --> 00:41:27,211
- She knows you like her?
- No.

528
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:30,350
- But you will tell her?
- No.

529
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:33,033
- Why?
- Because...

530
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:35,661
she is too beautiful.

531
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:41,318
My boy, this is very good.

532
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:44,042
You will do well,
may believe...

533
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:47,394
Tell that to her,
that she is 'beautiful'.

534
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,388
Sergeant Dunlop,
I saw the window.

535
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:54,214
Naked.

536
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:56,518
What?

537
00:41:58,094 --> 00:42:01,323
Can not look
the window of others.

538
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:05,098
What you saw?

539
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:08,232
She was going
cream on the body.

540
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,663
And she has very big <i>shadayim. </i>

541
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:13,836
<i>Shadayim?</i> hands?

542
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:18,055
No, hand. It's <i>yadayim. </i>
<i>Shadayim. </i>

543
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,332
Breasts.

544
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:22,347
Come that close?

545
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:26,276
I was on the roof
looking for binoculars.

546
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:28,715
No, my boy, do not want
become a Peeping Tom.

547
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,951
Who's Peeping Tom?

548
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:33,342
Sergeant Dunlop.
- Yes.

549
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:35,182
Is the curfew, at 17 hours.

550
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:36,589
Okay.

551
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,006
If I ever led to carfew again,
my father himself send me to prison.

552
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,468
Come, I take you home.

553
00:42:43,118 --> 00:42:44,776
Want a ride in the jeep?

554
00:42:45,806 --> 00:42:47,530
What do you say?

555
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:49,991
Undoubtedly.

556
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:01,157
All right?

557
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,283
<i>Where is he?</i>

558
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,132
<i>The idea was his.
Ten minutes before the touch. </i>

559
00:43:16,078 --> 00:43:17,998
<i>- Spoke with him yesterday?
- Yes... </i>

560
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:20,932
<i>He said find us here. </i>

561
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:45,707
Oh my God!

562
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,406
Oh, my God,
Today is Tuesday!

563
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:49,070
- What?
Do not go on this road!

564
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:50,027
Why?

565
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,037
Take the other road
to the city.

566
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,579
What are you talking about?

567
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,878
A truck turned old.
Has nails everywhere.

568
00:43:56,913 --> 00:44:00,142
I saw this morning.
Your tires are 'found'.

569
00:44:00,177 --> 00:44:01,579
No, it is boring.

570
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:03,818
Whatever!
Take the other road.

571
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,995
Okay.

572
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,245
<i>It is almost the curfew. </i>

573
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,878
<i>What donkey. </i>

574
00:44:12,913 --> 00:44:14,056
<i>We act?</i>

575
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,997
<i>Certainly. Immediate action. </i>

576
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,871
You can stop here.

577
00:44:58,575 --> 00:44:59,949
Again?

578
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,059
- Where is the papa?
- In the bathroom...

579
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:05,356
is there for 20 minutes.
God was looking after you.

580
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:09,540
Here, take off the shoes.

581
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:13,165
I spread your toys.

582
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,882
Pretend that you are here
some time ago.

583
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:20,076
- Where were you?
- With my friends.

584
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:22,820
They were here looking for you.

585
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,599
The liar's life
will never be a happy one.

586
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:32,840
<i>How could forget
a mission so important?</i>

587
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:38,318
<i>Is a girl who lives
the 2nd floor of the building's front... </i>

588
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:42,158
<i>and she is so beautiful she did
my head stops working. </i>

589
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:44,896
<i>What kind of soldier you are... </i>

590
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:47,599
<i>not think that because of a girl?</i>

591
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:50,256
<i>Girls are stupid. </i>

592
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:52,336
<i>I am sorry, of truth. </i>

593
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:54,347
<i>Can I do next week?</i>

594
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:56,870
<i>Implement the plan without you. </i>

595
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,463
<i>And no British truck
went there yesterday. </i>

596
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:03,212
<i>- Really?
- How can?</i>

597
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,966
<i>I do not know.
I have no idea. </i>

598
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,686
<i>You is with us, Proffy?
Or is... </i>

599
00:46:08,721 --> 00:46:11,534
<i>Of course I am.
F.</i>

600
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:32,942
<i>Dear listeners, here is the Voice
of Jerusalem, and here's the news. </i>

601
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:36,687
<i>Twelve British tanks
exploded tonight... </i>

602
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:38,378
<i>after passing over... </i>

603
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:39,942
<i>nails. </i>

604
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,789
<i>Kill all the... </i>

605
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,517
Kill the British!

606
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,126
- Good day, Proffy!
- Good day.

607
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,481
Okay, then okay.

608
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:54,156
Good day to you, Mr. Leibowitz.

609
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:57,087
I brought some things
the Book of Samuel...

610
00:47:57,122 --> 00:47:59,983
Much as I like
the Book of Samuel, today...

611
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:02,300
what do you think of snooker play?

612
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:04,582
<i>- Mitziah.
- Mitziah. </i> Come on.

613
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,751
I talked with my girlfriend
Priscilla yesterday.

614
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:11,369
- Spoke?
- I spoke, yes.

615
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,170
- And your girlfriend?
- Nothing new.

616
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:17,708
Anyway...

617
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:19,116
I spoke with Priscilla
by phone.

618
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:22,534
It was the first time
we talk about 6 months.

619
00:48:22,735 --> 00:48:25,801
They were just letters
and postcards.

620
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,349
Your turn.

621
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:32,175
What did you talk about?
May I ask?

622
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,383
Same things as men
and women speak.

623
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,557
What kind of things?
I like to know.

624
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:41,581
I was thinking of
when I leave.

625
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,421
I go home...

626
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:47,402
and man
to ask you in marriage.

627
00:48:48,815 --> 00:48:50,539
I myself long ago.

628
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:52,648
Do you know when?

629
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:55,663
When I asked her
in marriage?

630
00:48:57,264 --> 00:48:59,020
When you gone leave.

631
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,182
No really.

632
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:05,292
But they will be quite soon.

633
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:08,969
- Take a soda?
- Okay.

634
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,501
So yours.

635
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:20,267
A beer for me
and a soda for lad.

636
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:21,581
I already have.

637
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:24,015
Therefore, when you
think will leave?

638
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,651
I thought that we wanted far.

639
00:49:26,686 --> 00:49:29,253
I do.
The sooner the better.

640
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,455
Also wanted it was soon, my lad.

641
00:49:32,592 --> 00:49:34,383
Will not be a road
easy to follow.

642
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:36,871
The road of the past was not.

643
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:38,726
That is true.

644
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,613
Here it is.

645
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:46,697
Want to hear my prediction?

646
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,355
<i>Lamah lo. </i> Okey.

647
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:51,853
I think at the end
the British Mandate...

648
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:55,533
- there will be a Jewish state.
- This is what we want.

649
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:59,983
And there will be troubles,
this time between Arabs and Jews.

650
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:02,093
Troubles?
What kind of troubles?

651
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:06,288
The Arabs are the weakest.
It will be like the Jews.

652
00:50:06,323 --> 00:50:08,677
Is in the Bible.
The prophets predicted.

653
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,497
Want to hear my prediction?

654
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:13,358
<i>Lamah lo. </i>

655
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,934
Everything will be better
when all of you leave.

656
00:50:17,232 --> 00:50:19,141
Except of you.

657
00:50:22,096 --> 00:50:23,787
I need to go home.

658
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:33,513
I almost forgot.

659
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,887
I brought this book to you...

660
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:39,661
and the Book of Samuel.

661
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:44,133
- It is from a fifth grade class.
- Yes, it is at this level I am.

662
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:48,877
- I will return them soon.
- No, its yours to keep.

663
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:51,562
Thank you very much.

664
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,626
It is a wonderful gift.

665
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:58,475
I see you soon.

666
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,084
PROFFY LEIBOWITZ IS A TRAITOR

667
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:09,360
Mr. Leibowitz, quit, please.

668
00:51:09,395 --> 00:51:11,533
Please, we want talk to you.

669
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,840
- Get out, please.
- Mr. Leibowitz!

670
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:14,953
Quit!

671
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:16,493
What is it?

672
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:18,700
We are here
to talk about your son.

673
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,365
What is the problem?

674
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,939
- Proffy Leibowitz is a traitor.
- He betrayed the Jewish people!

675
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:28,272
Looks like you been Proffy
pass the secrets to the British.

676
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:29,997
What are you talking about?

677
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:32,464
Almost every day, he will
goes to the Oriental Palace...

678
00:51:32,499 --> 00:51:34,319
talk a British soldier.

679
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:37,296
It is one o'clock there
and then comes home.

680
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:39,434
We followed you, many times.

681
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,064
- Is this true?
- Is not what it seems.

682
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,512
Your child should be interrogated.

683
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,139
I am his father,
I'll take care of it.

684
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:52,678
<i>You should have spoken
before with me. </i>

685
00:51:59,632 --> 00:52:02,353
- So, no, children.
- Stop it.

686
00:52:02,388 --> 00:52:02,952
Stop!

687
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,294
This is unbelievable.

688
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,016
<i>Your child put us in danger?</i>

689
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,741
No, I don't think so.

690
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:20,173
But it'd better if you sleep somewhere else.

691
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:23,056
She is right.
The house is probably been watched.

692
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:24,109
I warn the others.

693
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,380
We will not sleep here, for now.

694
00:52:27,536 --> 00:52:29,391
We are very sorry.

695
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,967
- Is anybody there?
- No.

696
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:36,112
It seems to be quite.

697
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:42,190
Certainly the home monitor.

698
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:44,785
Maybe we shouldn't
get involved more with them.

699
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,445
We must do our part.

700
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,688
But we are at risks and Proffy too.

701
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,862
We are not planning anything...

702
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:53,930
only offer the house
for them to sleep.

703
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:58,407
Is he unhappy boy?

704
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:02,501
I do not know.

705
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:05,610
If you did
more attention to him...

706
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,037
- I understand that this is my fault.
- I never said that.

707
00:53:09,072 --> 00:53:12,525
- You said if I playing more...
- I am not talking about play...

708
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,536
- I'm talking about listening to him.
- Okay, if I had heard more...

709
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,438
he would not be fascinated
by a British soldier.

710
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:21,068
This is what you saying?

711
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,245
No.

712
00:53:41,744 --> 00:53:43,697
- What, boy?
- They followed me.

713
00:53:43,732 --> 00:53:45,314
Discovered that I visit you.

714
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:46,861
- Who?
- Ben Hur and Chita.

715
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:49,169
And my friends
don't talk to me anymore.

716
00:53:49,204 --> 00:53:50,765
And my parents are ashamed of me.

717
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,422
They call me a traitor
and I'm going to be interrogated.

718
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:56,304
- I go to talk to them.
- No, it will not make things better.

719
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:58,609
- But I want to help you.
- I can handle it myself.

720
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,656
If I talk to your
friends and family...

721
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:02,029
But it will be good for you.

722
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:04,366
For your situation with your army.

723
00:54:08,272 --> 00:54:11,207
Proffy, you really are...

724
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:18,125
I wish Priscilla meet you.

725
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:23,151
- And your mother in Manchester.
- Yes.

726
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:28,781
- Maybe one day.
- Maybe.

727
00:54:29,425 --> 00:54:33,069
Maybe one day there will be
Mandate a Jew in Britain.

728
00:54:37,009 --> 00:54:40,587
I think I will not able to... for a while.

729
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,206
Of course.

730
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:47,631
You better stay away.
That will be best.

731
00:54:51,728 --> 00:54:54,249
<i>Shalom</i>, Sergeant Dunlop.

732
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:03,530
<i>The price today is very good. </i>

733
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:05,998
<i>Here is. </i>

734
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:19,470
Come to our attention...

735
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:22,097
that you have a
relationship with a...

736
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,944
Sergeant Stephen Dunlop.

737
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:27,787
You visited him in Oriental Palace...

738
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:30,278
at least 12 times.
Is that correct?

739
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:33,134
Yes.

740
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:36,202
What is the nature of your
relationship with this man?

741
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:38,833
- We are friends.
- Friends?

742
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,077
I see.

743
00:55:40,273 --> 00:55:44,202
- You have friends your own age?
- I used to.

744
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:48,273
How did you meet this Sergeant Dunlop?

745
00:55:48,308 --> 00:55:49,806
I was out after curfew...

746
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,721
and he got me.
And was going to arrest me.

747
00:55:52,756 --> 00:55:55,688
- And did he arrested you?
- No.

748
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,998
Why was that?

749
00:55:58,033 --> 00:56:00,204
Maybe he find I was too young.

750
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:03,025
They arrested many boys of your age.

751
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,229
Some of them were beaten.

752
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,272
Do you offer something...

753
00:56:07,473 --> 00:56:10,609
or said something that made
he decides not arrest you?

754
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:13,969
I told him, I wasn't afraid
if he arrested me.

755
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,694
And how did he respond?

756
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:17,646
He said he let me go this time,

757
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:20,529
but the next time
if I be out of the curfew,

758
00:56:20,564 --> 00:56:22,254
he have to arrest me.

759
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:25,966
So, why did you start to visit him?

760
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:28,553
It was very interesting
to talk with him.

761
00:56:34,577 --> 00:56:38,506
- What would you talk about?
- I do not know. Things.

762
00:56:38,578 --> 00:56:39,952
Girls.

763
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:43,665
He likes to talk about Hebrew language.

764
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,062
And the Bible.
His father was a minister.

765
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:49,746
He asked if you knew
any underground activities?

766
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,671
No.

767
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:53,330
He asked if you knew anybody
in the underground?

768
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:54,671
Never.

769
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:57,297
Did you had any political
discussions with him?

770
00:56:57,332 --> 00:57:00,241
You mean like Ben Gurion or something?

771
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:02,510
- Yes.
- I do not remember.

772
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,977
Look, he knows
that I hate the British.

773
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:06,670
I hate the occupation.

774
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:09,842
So you did had a
political discussion with him?

775
00:57:09,877 --> 00:57:12,143
Yes, but no.

776
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:15,425
Sergeant Dunlop asked
the name of your friends?

777
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,478
- No.
Do not want to know about your friends?

778
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:21,489
He wanted to know about
my friends and my family...

779
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:23,758
never asked their names.

780
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:27,439
If you're hiding
any information from us...

781
00:57:27,474 --> 00:57:30,572
you can be put in the prison,
regardless of your age.

782
00:57:31,793 --> 00:57:36,047
All right.
After the transcript...

783
00:57:36,082 --> 00:57:39,570
we will decide if and when
any punishment...

784
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:42,701
of Proffy Leibowitz and his family.

785
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:45,870
You will be under watch by next month...

786
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:48,977
and will be forbiden from having any
contact with this British soldier.

787
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:53,003
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

788
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,842
That closed our session.

789
00:57:58,577 --> 00:58:01,262
<i>You is a terrible traitor. </i>

790
00:58:01,297 --> 00:58:05,072
<i>The worst traitor is that
that approaches the enemy. </i>

791
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:24,845
I do believe that you were telling the truth.

792
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:28,145
But after what I have seen...

793
00:58:29,137 --> 00:58:31,985
I trust no human being.

794
00:58:32,306 --> 00:58:36,135
On <i>Montag</i>, you have friends...

795
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:41,195
on <i>Freitag</i>, they become our enemies.

796
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:47,536
The only one you can trust are the chickens.

797
00:58:53,778 --> 00:58:55,022
Frank!

798
00:58:55,154 --> 00:58:58,002
Hi old man.
You are going home!

799
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,719
Are now almost 4 years.

800
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:03,602
I am counting the minutes
out of this hell.

801
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:05,736
I think you will miss it.

802
00:59:05,938 --> 00:59:08,840
I want to be in a country
where they are pleased to see me.

803
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:13,040
Listen, you know that kid
coming visit me?

804
00:59:13,234 --> 00:59:15,089
Coming over time?

805
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:18,994
Say that I sent home
and not to talk to him...

806
00:59:19,029 --> 00:59:20,303
before leaving.

807
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:24,654
Tell him I wish a brilliant life.

808
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:28,622
- You can do this?
- Of course, Stephen.

809
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:29,866
Sure.

810
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:31,825
- See you in Thistle Square.
- Bye.

811
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:36,392
Stay away from Proffy.

812
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,127
Do not worry.

813
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:41,228
You will have fun at school
I promise.

814
00:59:41,426 --> 00:59:43,019
So stay calm.

815
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,362
Do not worry
and be well, right?

816
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:46,671
It will be okay.

817
00:59:46,706 --> 00:59:49,772
Stay away from Proffy, understand?
Do not approach him.

818
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:52,848
You will love it, I promise.

819
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:01,874
<i>Good morning, students... </i>

820
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:04,339
<i>welcome the new school year. </i>

821
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:06,735
<i>Good morning, teacher Gihon. </i>

822
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,192
<i>We have a new student this year... </i>

823
01:00:09,427 --> 01:00:12,722
<i>Rachel Hochberg,
she does not speak Hebrew. </i>

824
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:16,687
We have a new student,
Rachel Hochberg...

825
01:00:16,722 --> 01:00:20,498
which came to us from Cyprus.
<i>Bruchim Habaaim. </i>

826
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,313
<i>Hope you have
enjoyed the holidays. </i>

827
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:29,255
<i>We all know the evil
occurred in the last week... </i>

828
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:32,819
<i>Quiet, quiet. </i>

829
01:00:32,854 --> 01:00:34,029
<i>Freeze. </i>

830
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,016
<i>Silence be quiet. </i>

831
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:37,902
<i>Freeze. Freeze. </i>

832
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,854
<i>- You saw the Sergeant Dunlop?
- No, sorry. </i>

833
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:07,888
- You saw the Sergeant Dunlop?
- No.

834
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,585
You saw the Sergeant Dunlop?

835
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,121
- No, not seen.
- Me neither.

836
01:01:11,186 --> 01:01:13,259
You know where the
Sergeant Dunlop is?

837
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,280
I do not know.

838
01:01:15,315 --> 01:01:17,289
They took him to the barricades.

839
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,305
Pass me the ashtray, please.

840
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:25,514
Thank you.

841
01:01:49,682 --> 01:01:54,287
<i>Division 23, 6h training. </i>

842
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:58,803
- You do not have permission.
- I want to see the Sergeant Dunlop.

843
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:00,048
I do not know who he is...

844
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,312
and you are not allowed
to enter, understand?

845
01:02:03,411 --> 01:02:06,067
I just want to say goodbye before
he return to England.

846
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:09,298
Listen, boy,
I am not speaking in code...

847
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,754
you can not enter.

848
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,344
Where the soldiers going?

849
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:21,801
Are going to Haifa, go back home.

850
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:29,182
Sergeant Dunlop!
Sergeant Dunlop!

851
01:02:29,217 --> 01:02:33,193
Sergeant Dunlop!
Sergeant Dunlop!

852
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:35,346
Sergeant Dunlop!

853
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:57,533
- Proffy? Is everything all right?
<i>- I am tired, Ima. </i>

854
01:02:57,568 --> 01:03:01,673
- Come, I make you some pudding.
<i>- I do not want pudding. </i>

855
01:03:18,355 --> 01:03:21,551
We have made decision
about your son.

856
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,360
Thank you.

857
01:03:25,395 --> 01:03:29,075
At school asked to stay vigilant
and ask them the same.

858
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,091
We must always know where he is.

859
01:03:31,126 --> 01:03:32,498
Yes, of course.

860
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:35,763
The boy must not be envolved
in any controversy...

861
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:36,908
Nothing.

862
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:40,179
Whatever individual politics may be.

863
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:41,935
The boy is just a boy.

864
01:03:47,155 --> 01:03:48,432
<i>Chita, wait... </i>

865
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:50,539
<i>will never talk to me?</i>

866
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:53,905
<i>Hey, sorry for not
told them the truth. </i>

867
01:03:54,324 --> 01:03:56,298
<i>I was scared. </i>

868
01:03:57,139 --> 01:03:59,278
<i>You want a Gibi borrow?</i>

869
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:02,028
<i>You can even get one or two. </i>

870
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:08,300
<i>And homework?
I can help you. </i>

871
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:16,336
We have good news
for you, Proffy.

872
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:19,347
- Yes?
- They are not pressing any charges against you.

873
01:04:19,382 --> 01:04:21,387
I never did anything wrong.

874
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:27,698
Well, that's what they decided.

875
01:04:27,955 --> 01:04:30,989
I wish other people think so.

876
01:04:31,187 --> 01:04:33,326
I think, it's better in school?

877
01:04:33,555 --> 01:04:35,411
Nothing is better anymore.

878
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:36,872
I hate the school.

879
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,571
Do you like I have the conversation
with Mr. Gihon?

880
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:44,528
My God, no.
It make things worse.

881
01:04:44,563 --> 01:04:47,410
Besides, he hates me
as much as the rest.

882
01:04:48,595 --> 01:04:50,371
They do not hate you, Proffy.

883
01:04:50,406 --> 01:04:52,112
They are making the scapegoat.

884
01:04:52,147 --> 01:04:54,675
Sometimes, children need
someone to criticize.

885
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:57,490
They hate me
because of Sergeant Dunlop.

886
01:04:57,555 --> 01:05:01,483
But my enemy was much more
friend to me that my friends.

887
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:07,923
Do you think it will be possible...

888
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:08,872
What?

889
01:05:09,908 --> 01:05:12,810
I know you will think I am crazy.

890
01:05:13,971 --> 01:05:16,589
Do you think there is any chance...

891
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:20,563
that we go back to Poland?

892
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:24,305
We fought so hard to get here.

893
01:05:24,435 --> 01:05:27,251
Why you want to go to Poland?

894
01:05:27,286 --> 01:05:29,073
I ruined this country.

895
01:05:29,108 --> 01:05:31,791
Do not be silly,
you only 11 years old.

896
01:05:31,955 --> 01:05:34,770
In Poland, I could make a fresh start.

897
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,936
In school call me the 'traitor'
and they hates me.

898
01:05:37,971 --> 01:05:41,971
Maybe there I have the chance
to be known as fine man...

899
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:43,536
instead of here.

900
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:46,189
A 'traitor' for the rest of my life.

901
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,692
Proffy...

902
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,377
no way hell to go to Poland.

903
01:05:53,267 --> 01:05:54,412
Eat.

904
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,592
<i>So Proffy... </i>

905
01:06:08,627 --> 01:06:11,411
<i>that there is
sitting here so long?</i>

906
01:06:11,446 --> 01:06:13,233
<i>What problem? I like. </i>

907
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,852
<i>And the friends with whom
runs the city?</i>

908
01:06:16,887 --> 01:06:18,964
<i>do not know who are my friends. </i>

909
01:06:18,999 --> 01:06:20,208
<i>What is a friend, anyway?</i>

910
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,485
<i>Listen this... </i>

911
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:29,422
<i>'Tell me who you walk with,
and tell you who you are. '</i>

912
01:06:32,596 --> 01:06:34,189
<i>But that boy. </i>

913
01:06:37,396 --> 01:06:40,298
- I told him?
- Not yet.

914
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,820
Proffy, your mother and I
we will travel for a few days.

915
01:06:44,855 --> 01:06:45,900
Why?

916
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,756
There will be a honor service of people...

917
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:50,828
who died in our town in Poland.

918
01:06:51,412 --> 01:06:54,611
- We must go to that.
- And we also need to get away.

919
01:06:54,646 --> 01:06:55,984
But what about me?

920
01:06:56,019 --> 01:06:58,449
I never am at this family?

921
01:06:58,484 --> 01:07:02,128
- I also need to get away.
- You must to be in school.

922
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,493
Where is the honor service?

923
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:06,348
In Tel Aviv.

924
01:07:06,516 --> 01:07:08,971
- Why can not I go?
- It is not for you.

925
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:13,684
But what about after the honor service?
We can do something in Tel Aviv.

926
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:15,717
Your father and I need be alone.

927
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:17,716
Why do I always that left at home?

928
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:20,049
It's not fair. It is cruel!

929
01:07:20,084 --> 01:07:21,876
We ask for a neighbor
to look after you.

930
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:23,668
A young woman who lives
cross the way.

931
01:07:23,703 --> 01:07:25,009
Yardena?

932
01:07:26,388 --> 01:07:29,038
You know her?
She works at the bakery.

933
01:07:31,028 --> 01:07:34,292
You are right.
I can be such a selfish child.

934
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:36,436
Always thinking about myself.

935
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:38,546
Never thinking about my parents.

936
01:07:39,252 --> 01:07:43,049
Go to honor service
and have a wonderful time.

937
01:07:58,484 --> 01:08:01,648
- Hello.
<i>- Shalom</i> everyone.

938
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:04,978
<i>- Shalom,</i> Yardena.
<i>- Shalom,</i> Proffy.

939
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:07,793
So, there is plenty of
food in the kitchen...

940
01:08:07,828 --> 01:08:09,940
for the next two days,
make sure you eat all of it.

941
01:08:09,975 --> 01:08:12,144
And Proffy? Be a good boy?

942
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:16,400
Have a good time.
<i>Nisiya Tovah. </i>

943
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,841
Bye.

944
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,025
Bye, Proffy.

945
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,876
So, you are a little traitor,
boy, aren't you?

946
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:24,693
- I am not a traitor.
- We discuss that later.

947
01:08:24,728 --> 01:08:27,562
Come, let's make a super dinner!

948
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,999
- You want coffee?
- Who? Me?

949
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:53,101
Is anybody else at this dinner party?

950
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,046
Sure, I'd like some.

951
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:10,505
- Is it too strong?
- No, it's delicious.

952
01:09:21,396 --> 01:09:22,577
So tell me...

953
01:09:22,612 --> 01:09:24,309
you passed secret to the British?

954
01:09:24,344 --> 01:09:25,738
Never.

955
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:30,930
- They put you on trial, no?
- They ask me few questions.

956
01:09:40,436 --> 01:09:43,060
Proffy, you know, you can tell me anything.

957
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,710
I know how to keep a secrets.

958
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,290
Are you in the underground?

959
01:09:46,325 --> 01:09:48,757
Oh yes, I pass the secret undergroung
for <i>rugalach</i>...

960
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:51,124
and hide weapons in
<i>Challah, all Shabbat. </i>

961
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,909
So, what was so interesting
about this British man?

962
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:01,716
I find most of them
so boring, no passion.

963
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:03,636
Sergeant Dunlop had a passion.

964
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:05,682
Yes? How do you know?

965
01:10:05,717 --> 01:10:07,920
I talk to him a lot of things.

966
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:10,911
- Like what?
- Like you.

967
01:10:10,946 --> 01:10:13,674
Me?
You do not know me.

968
01:10:14,005 --> 01:10:15,892
But, I know a lot about you.

969
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,758
And the Sergeant Dunlop is interested
in everything I had to say.

970
01:10:21,813 --> 01:10:26,635
You know, when I close my eyes
and try to think of Sergeant Dunlop...

971
01:10:26,837 --> 01:10:30,666
I can see him clearly.
His pink skin...

972
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:35,473
his short fingernails
his big eyebrows.

973
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:38,805
But when close my eyes
and try to think of papa...

974
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,877
it's hard to see him.

975
01:10:41,813 --> 01:10:43,765
I do not know how papa's teeth...

976
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,318
because he never smiles.

977
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:53,581
So, where is your
British soldier now?

978
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:55,918
He went back to Britain.

979
01:10:56,309 --> 01:11:00,019
Yes, they all are to leave soon.

980
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:01,845
I just hope we don't regret...

981
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,445
when we are without them.

982
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,071
The British must go.

983
01:11:05,589 --> 01:11:07,978
It would be
It would be disappearing.

984
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:10,706
I mean, I was...

985
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:14,188
but the rest of them
we have to drive out.

986
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,916
We will...

987
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:19,311
but not tonight.

988
01:11:19,445 --> 01:11:21,812
Look at the time.
It's almost almost 11.

989
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:24,437
And tell me, are you sound sleeper?

990
01:11:24,472 --> 01:11:26,771
Yes. No.

991
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:28,402
It depends.

992
01:11:28,437 --> 01:11:32,365
- Well, tonight it's better to sleep soundly.
- Why?

993
01:11:32,469 --> 01:11:34,674
If you do happen to wake up
we can turn on the light...

994
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:39,379
and read until the morning if you want,
but do not you dare leave your room.

995
01:11:39,957 --> 01:11:43,340
- Promise?
- Promise.

996
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:45,643
Hi, my love.

997
01:11:46,037 --> 01:11:48,949
- Where's the boy?
- Locked in his room.

998
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:50,029
Sure.

999
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:17,457
<i>Is already open?</i>

1000
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:18,987
<i>This is easier. </i>

1001
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:37,453
<i>- BoKer Tov, yeled.
- BoKer Tov. </i>

1002
01:12:39,509 --> 01:12:41,843
Your parents will be home this afternoon.

1003
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,634
Are you ready for school?

1004
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:46,157
I don't have to go to school every day.

1005
01:12:46,389 --> 01:12:47,698
Really?

1006
01:12:48,278 --> 01:12:50,481
What kind of school is that?

1007
01:12:50,614 --> 01:12:53,167
I know all that teach in school.

1008
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,566
I did not realize that you are so smart.

1009
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:58,130
I am not.

1010
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,238
It's just my class is too slow for me.

1011
01:13:01,429 --> 01:13:03,850
Maybe you can
teach me something.

1012
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:08,206
- Like what?
- Like things of life.

1013
01:13:12,982 --> 01:13:15,600
Do not you have
your binoculars for that?

1014
01:13:23,286 --> 01:13:24,911
Now go to school.

1015
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:26,869
I will be gone
when you come back...

1016
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:28,593
and your parents will be home.

1017
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:38,229
When I'll be your age
you will be 27.

1018
01:13:38,264 --> 01:13:39,374
So?

1019
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:43,403
- So I'll be taller than you by than.
- Probably.

1020
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,212
Can I tell you something?

1021
01:13:48,502 --> 01:13:49,712
Yes.

1022
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:53,333
You know, I never talked
as you are beautiful.

1023
01:13:53,368 --> 01:13:54,828
You know why?

1024
01:13:56,598 --> 01:14:00,438
Because you are too beautiful.
You are just too beautiful.

1025
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:04,628
- Thank you, Proffy.
- You are welcome.

1026
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:13,803
<i>please have... </i>

1027
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:17,935
<i>their evidence on
the history of Zionism. </i>

1028
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:22,358
<i>The notes of you
begin in 100... </i>

1029
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:25,554
<i>and sank to 5.</i>

1030
01:14:26,325 --> 01:14:30,774
<i>This means that a student
20 issues... </i>

1031
01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:34,803
<i>hit only one. </i>

1032
01:14:34,838 --> 01:14:36,910
<i>And the 'honor' belongs... </i>

1033
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:41,205
<i>Chita ReznicK.</i>

1034
01:14:41,654 --> 01:14:43,154
<i>Freeze. </i>

<i>Eliahu katz, 80th

1038
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:57,965
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1039
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:03,446
<i>And who received
the highest note, Professor?</i>

1040
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:05,907
<i>I say to everyone... </i>

1041
01:15:05,942 --> 01:15:09,357
<i>note that the maximum is a... </i>

1042
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:12,142
<i>Proffy Leibowitz. </i>

1043
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,182
<i>O 'beloved'.</i>

1044
01:15:25,718 --> 01:15:29,046
- Hi, I'm Proffy Leibowitz.
- I know that.

1045
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:31,697
- Do you speak Hebrew?
- Not yet.

1046
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:36,246
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since you came to class.

1047
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,417
Really? Why don't you?

1048
01:15:38,646 --> 01:15:41,941
Because you are too beautiful.

1049
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:45,963
You are not just beautiful,
you are too beautiful.

1050
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,069

1088
01:18:02,518 --> 01:18:06,544
<i>The resolution of this Committee

1089
01:18:06,935 --> 01:18:12,085
<i>was adopted by 33 votes,
13 against and 10 abstains. </i>

1090
01:19:22,327 --> 01:19:24,116
See what happened?

1091
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:28,081
It will be good, right?

1092
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:54,071
The crash between Israelis
and the Palestinians...

1093
01:19:54,106 --> 01:19:56,148
- is a tragedy.
LONDON - 30 YEARS LATER

1094
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:57,431
- Neither Israeli Jews...
LONDON - 30 YEARS LATER

1095
01:19:57,466 --> 01:19:58,679
- nor Arabs of Palestine...
LONDON - 30 YEARS LATER

1096
01:19:58,714 --> 01:20:01,777
can find national homeland anywhere else.

1097
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:04,020
The Zionism, for my family...

1098
01:20:04,055 --> 01:20:07,568
was not a matter making a choice
in travel agency.

1099
01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:11,247
It was there only life choice.

1100
01:20:11,511 --> 01:20:13,300
If there is a fire...

1101
01:20:13,335 --> 01:20:15,061
you can run for your life...

1102
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:17,583
and let those who can not run burn.

1103
01:20:17,783 --> 01:20:21,078
Or you can fill a bucket...

1104
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:23,030
or a glass...

1105
01:20:24,343 --> 01:20:27,303
or a teaspoon of water...

1106
01:20:27,338 --> 01:20:30,228
to pour it to the flames.

1107
01:20:30,263 --> 01:20:33,459
The fire is huge and a teaspoon is...

1108
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:38,389
very small, but every men and women...

1109
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:40,334
have a teaspoon.

1110
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:44,141
Each of us,
who shares this hope...

1111
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:47,412
will wear a tiny teaspoon on your lapels.

1112
01:20:48,503 --> 01:20:50,030
So that we know.

1113
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,596
Thank you.

1114
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,479

I came across tha passage

1119
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:47,443

1120
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:53,230
and was in favor

1121
01:21:54,903 --> 01:21:57,075
