1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,500
So there's nothing I can say?

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,473
I guess tomorrow
it'll all begin.

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,203
I'm sure everything
will be okay.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,576
Nikki, please.
This game is real.

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,706
You don't know that.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,718
Check your mirror.
See if it's cracked.

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,084
You don't get it.

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,817
Once Mary takes the dare
we're all dead.

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,685
So what are you going to do?

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,774
Ryan!

11
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,605
Ryan!

12
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,407
Ryan!
Ryan!

13
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,507
Ryan!

14
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,087
Amy!
Amy!

15
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,720
Amy!

16
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,061
Amy!
Amy!

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,432
Amy.
Amy?

18
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,543
Ryan.

19
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,023
You'll be mine too.

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,294
Ryan!
Ryan, please!

21
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,195
- Amy!
- What?

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,764
What?
What happened?

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,474
Nothing.
Sorry, it was just a bad dream.

24
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,480
They're called
nightmares, babe.

25
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,951
Thank you for clarifying.

26
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,061
Maybe you should talk
to someone about this.

27
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,624
I'm fine.

28
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,761
Really.

29
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,637
That's like almost
every night this week.

30
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,508
Well, I have good months
and this just isn't one of them.

31
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,451
I don't remember a good one.

32
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:46,025
What about your
professor friend O'Neal?

33
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,896
Please.

34
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,868
You know what?
I don't need help from O'Neal

35
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,838
or my folks or even you.

36
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,071
You know what? You just can't keep
blaming yourself forever.

37
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,636
# I've been crying out loud
for a fantasy #

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,169
# You're lying in my mind
like a water drain #

39
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,547
# You feel so soft
underneath the swell #

40
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,483
# Gonna bring it to me now #

41
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,418
# We just can't tell #

42
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,616
# I can't wait #

43
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,321
# To be with you this time #

44
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,728
# Gonna run to that place #

45
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,700
# Where you take me inside #

46
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,236
# Your heart #

47
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,137
# Inside of you #

48
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,113
# My heart beats faster
when I think of you #

49
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,887
# My blood pumps harder
when it's time to go #

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,327
# All the things
that make you feel so good #

51
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,457
# Between the sheets
like lovers should #

52
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,264
# I can't wait #

53
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,135
# To be with you this time #

54
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,200
# Want to run to that place #

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,873
# Where we can't be denied #

56
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,781
# I can't wait #

57
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,820
# To be with you this time #

58
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,880
# Get you down
on your knees #

59
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,291
# So you'll take me
deep inside #

60
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,727
# Your heart #

61
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,857
# Inside of you. #

62
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,626
You can tell Terry
this is gonna take awhile.

63
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,593
Well, how long?

64
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,634
A lot more time
than he wants.

65
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,839
Unless it be thy contention

66
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,178
that immaculate conception
hath been visited

67
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,184
upon thee,
Mary Worth,

68
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,245
thou wilt name
thy unborn child's

69
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,917
natal father.

70
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:37,691
If there be but one among us
wishing to claim paternity

71
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,858
to save this child

72
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,561
of but 16 year
from the gallows,

73
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,161
speaketh now.

74
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,799
If it be thy seed

75
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,173
that hath spawned
this unborn child

76
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,905
speaketh now

77
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,039
and the Lord
shall forgive thee.

78
00:06:56,115 --> 00:07:00,245
The sin of adultery
doth pale

79
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,311
in the blinding light
of heresy.

80
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,897
Thou wilt not then name the fornicator
with whom thou hast lain?

81
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,833
Citizens of Idlewood,

82
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,639
hear ye in this silence

83
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,906
a blasphemous testimony.

84
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,778
There hath been but one

85
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,410
Immaculate Conception
known to man.

86
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,283
To claim otherwise

87
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,152
doth constitute
but sheer heresy.

88
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,886
It is clearly
the devil's child.

89
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,921
Mary Worth,

90
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,262
thou knowest how the court
doth proceed in such matters.

91
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,736
Wilt thou confess then

92
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,863
to lying with the devil?

93
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,610
Wilt thou repent
for thy sins

94
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,238
and save thy soul?

95
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,363
I'm sorry.
It's a little loud on my end.

96
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,836
Who is this?

97
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:30,171
You don't know me but you know
my boyfriend Ryan Cumane.

98
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,337
Oh yeah, Ryan.

99
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,108
This may sound
a little weird.

100
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,309
Um, he's been having
nightmares.

101
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,942
Nightmares?

102
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,611
Yes.

103
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,786
And?

104
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,319
He... see, he rarely talks
to anyone

105
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,593
and he's been...
he's mentioned

106
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,329
how easy it is
to talk to you.

107
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,598
Look, I'm not
a psychiatrist.

108
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,072
And besides, I know nothing
on sleep disorders.

109
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,008
- He doesn't need a shrink.
- Then what are you looking for?

110
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,374
I thought you
were a priest.

111
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,970
- He needs a priest?
- He needs help.

112
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,243
Look, Rachel, I'm not sure
what I can do.

113
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,308
Besides,
if he needs a confession,

114
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,183
I'm not that type of priest.

115
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,017
Well, what kind
of priest are you?

116
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,489
Busy.

117
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,426
Look, can you at least
just talk to him

118
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,020
and maybe convince him
to see a professional?

119
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,429
Nightmares, huh?

120
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,593
Yes.

121
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,968
I'll meet him at the school's
coffee shop at 3:00.

122
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,838
He'll be there.

123
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,288
Shit.

124
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,221
No wonder he's having
nightmares.

125
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,802
I thought she was
going to tell you.

126
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,150
One would think that
would be appropriate

127
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,383
rather than showing up
to a mini intervention.

128
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,062
It's not that at all.
She's just concerned,

129
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,291
wanted us to chat
a little bit.

130
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,504
So who do you have
for American Lit?

131
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,737
Like I said,
I'm not interested.

132
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,246
You still thinking about
Creative Writing?

133
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,716
Really, I appreciate
your concern,

134
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,655
but I've always had
bad dreams.

135
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,063
Always?

136
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,373
You believe
in the devil, right?

137
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,279
Sure.

138
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,680
It's complicated
in today's age, isn't it?

139
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,246
What do you mean?

140
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,349
Faith.

141
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,155
Faith.

142
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,628
Faith has had its issues

143
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,631
throughout the history
of the faithful.

144
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,664
What about your faith, Ryan?

145
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,702
What about witches, Father?

146
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,210
Do they have a place
in reality anymore?

147
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,476
I believe that humans have
made deals with the devil.

148
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,612
Different cultures
have different names...

149
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:46,784
warlocks, wizards,
magicians, witches.

150
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,761
Just different names
for the same thing...

151
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,292
people who use the dark arts
to conjure evil.

152
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,072
Maybe it's easier
to get the devil

153
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,268
to listen than it is God.

154
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,243
God's always listening.

155
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,906
It's the devil that needs
to be invited.

156
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,643
What if you don't
believe in the devil?

157
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,913
The devil still
believes in you.

158
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,561
In the spring of 2001

159
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,005
I had a sister

160
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,875
who was just getting ready to graduate
high school and I was just going in.

161
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,413
You remember that horrible
storm we had that year?

162
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,608
Yeah, well it was coming down
really hard.

163
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,175
We had those hurricane
warnings all day.

164
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,082
Ryan! Ryan!

165
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,558
Ryan, please open the door.

166
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,529
- Ryan!
- Amy.

167
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,513
Amy.

168
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,657
Amy?

169
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,422
Amy?

170
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,028
Amy, stop screwing around.

171
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,165
Ow.

172
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,265
Amy...

173
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,705
Amy?

174
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,661
You better not be fooling.

175
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,791
Oh my God.

176
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,300
Amy?

177
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,653
Amy, are you in here?

178
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,985
Amy!

179
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,086
Amy!

180
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,861
Christ, I thought
you were dead.

181
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,992
What happened?

182
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,443
She went missing that night.

183
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,643
The next day
she wasn't in her room,

184
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,879
she never showed up
for class.

185
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,215
We never saw her again.

186
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,882
The nightmares started
after that?

187
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,688
Yeah, they started that night.

188
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,528
Ever since,
my eyes have turned blue.

189
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,239
Do you feel somewhat responsible
for your sister's disappearance?

190
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,606
Why, do you think I should?

191
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,043
No.

192
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,009
Well, thanks
for the chat, Father.

193
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,642
I feel better.

194
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,242
But you'll have
to forgive me.

195
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,254
I'm going to end
my psych analysis.

196
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,189
I've got a class
I'll be late for.

197
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,022
Whatever came
of the investigation?

198
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,426
Nothing.

199
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,897
Called the police precinct
every night for a year

200
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,127
and got the same
shitty answer.

201
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,035
"Sorry, kid.
But don't give up hope."

202
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,936
No, you can't.

203
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,003
Well, I did.

204
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,879
So what do we got?

205
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,115
You were right.
Carbon dates the bones

206
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,249
back to late 1680s,
early 1690s.

207
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,959
What about the police?

208
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,464
300-year-old bones means
archeological not criminal.

209
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,261
What about
the construction?

210
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,599
Since it's on church property
we've got as long as we need.

211
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,262
When can we begin digging?

212
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,239
Filed for the permits
this afternoon.

213
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,071
Should be able to begin
marking a grid by tomorrow.

214
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,341
You're amazing, Clair, I don't know
what I would do without you...

215
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,812
I don't know,
what would you do?

216
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,747
You know what this means,
don't you?

217
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,580
What?

218
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,347
The diary.

219
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,981
You're not thinking this is
the missing mass grave, are you?

220
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,686
Yes. He wrote the church
was built upon a grave

221
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,353
to bless the land.

222
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,454
I just don't know
how far you can take

223
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,659
the diary of a man
who wasn't even there.

224
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,599
He wasn't just any person.

225
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,261
He was the governor.

226
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,170
He personally heard
Reverend Whittaker speak of the plague

227
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,208
ravaging the entire town.

228
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,171
Well, if more heads start
popping out of the ground

229
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,440
I'll believe you.

230
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,982
Clair, you truly are
one of a kind.

231
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,987
"Thursday, October 28th,
1689.

232
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,888
I arrived in Idlewood
early morning

233
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,721
to find the streets bare

234
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,954
and the town
all but soulless.

235
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,725
All but for one...
the Reverend Whittaker.

236
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,002
My concern
for the townspeople is grim.

237
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,267
But the Reverend Whittaker
was cleaning human bones

238
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,433
when we arrived

239
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,239
and had spoken of pox and plague
ravaging the entire community.

240
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,281
By a fortnight
word will have reached Salem

241
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,012
that the plague has wiped out
all of Idlewood.

242
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,146
My concern layeth
with the Reverend.

243
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,588
I fear the strain
of such a loss

244
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,353
has disturbed the poor man.

245
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,827
I feel a church...
a just monument

246
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,388
and a beacon of hope...
to be built upon the graves

247
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,958
of thy towns
founding fathers.

248
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,470
It is very honorable.
Very honorable.

249
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,665
Governor Holbrook,
may I present

250
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,437
the head of our reconstruction team,
Reverend Samuel Blake?

251
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,001
- How do you do, Reverend?
- Governor.

252
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,537
I have every confidence that word
of what hath transpired here

253
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,641
shall remain strictly
confidential.

254
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,583
Yes.
Of course, sir.

255
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,781
This site is to be cleansed

256
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,687
and built upon.

257
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,589
Indeed, Governor.

258
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,729
There, you see?

259
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,677
Jesus!

260
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,774
Jessie, how did you
get in here?

261
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,347
Sorry.

262
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,288
Jessie, how'd you
get in here?

263
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,262
Let's get you some food.

264
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,505
Amy!

265
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,720
Look, I'm sorry I yelled
at you earlier.

266
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,751
I realize you just called him
'cause you care.

267
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,422
And I was wrong
to get angry at you.

268
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,795
But you have to realize something.
I've been through

269
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,805
a dozen different meds
and a dozen different shrinks.

270
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,467
And the only thing that I've found
is that it doesn't work.

271
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,212
Come on. You can't be mad
at me forever.

272
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,115
How about I ditch
my morning class

273
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,847
and we go to Clark's
for breakfast?

274
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,096
Don't call me.
I'm over this.

275
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,568
Wait.

276
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,674
Oh, Jesus.

277
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,206
Oh my God.

278
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,450
So how long do you need
the gymnasium for?

279
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,183
Uh...
a few more weeks.

280
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,623
Ryan.
I'll see you later.

281
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,388
Hey, how's Creative Writing
coming along?

282
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,325
Did you have
another nightmare?

283
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,835
Yeah, but this time it was...
it was different.

284
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,769
You know, it felt more real.

285
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,807
Stronger.

286
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,069
Why don't we step
into my office?

287
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,974
All right.

288
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,176
So how's your girlfriend?

289
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,308
It's Rachel, right?

290
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,910
- She left me.
- Oh.

291
00:25:55,987 --> 00:26:00,219
Well, you know, you just got to give
these things some time.

292
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,055
I guess.

293
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,379
Everything all right?

294
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,279
It's deja vu.

295
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,821
Some cultures believe
that deja vu

296
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,484
is God's way of letting you know
you're on the right path.

297
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,584
Is that so?

298
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,891
It could also be a hiccup
in your brain chemistry

299
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,455
as you process new information
through a memory cell.

300
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,967
So which one is it?

301
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,468
- Why couldn't it be both?
- Both?

302
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,345
Sure. Why couldn't the chemical
hiccups have a purpose?

303
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,779
Everything does.
It's all part of the master plan.

304
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,317
So what about
my nightmares?

305
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,478
Are they also
part of the plan?

306
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,391
Sure. Why not?
There's so much we don't know.

307
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,257
It's called
the Butterfly Effect.

308
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,627
Yeah, a flap of the wings

309
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,599
on one side of the planet
can cause waves on the other.

310
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,865
Something like that.

311
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,032
Everything that ever happened
in history

312
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,100
happened from a chain reaction
from previous events,

313
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,010
which still continues
to this day.

314
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,980
Our lives
are governed by it.

315
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,983
You're a prime example.

316
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,916
Did you choose to have
these nightmares?

317
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,385
No.

318
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,183
But I chose
not to have them.

319
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,651
So how's that
working for you?

320
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,526
Great.

321
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,532
It's all about cause
and effect.

322
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,161
We need to find out the cause that
effected you with these nightmares

323
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,695
and see what we can do
to effect it to stop.

324
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,344
You know, my sister wasn't the only one
that went missing that night.

325
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,437
There were more?

326
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,277
There was four.

327
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,182
There was Nicole and Jennifer,
her two girlfriends.

328
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,049
And, uh...

329
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,781
Greg and John,

330
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,880
two guys that they met
at the party.

331
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,686
Party?

332
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,057
Yeah, they were
planning this

333
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,289
big senior year blowout

334
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,889
and they needed
the ultimate game.

335
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,995
You ever heard of the game
Bloody Mary Worth?

336
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,534
Well, my sister did.

337
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,204
She told her friends.

338
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,313
- So, like, you almost done?
- Relax.

339
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,153
It's the server. Probably the storm.
Just give it some time.

340
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,283
Well, we need to go over
the music list with Amy.

341
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,353
- You did ask her, right?
- Ask her what?

342
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,668
I did.
I'm just playing with you.

343
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,704
She told me
to call back later.

344
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,341
It's 9:15.
Should we call?

345
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,572
If you want to call her so bad,
pick up the phone and call her yourself.

346
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,852
What is with her?

347
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,760
She probably fell asleep
or something.

348
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,264
Forget it.

349
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,028
Girl is probably dead
to the world.

350
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,642
So what's next?

351
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,876
Hey, this might be cool.

352
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,351
You could get one of the guys
to spit out pea soup.

353
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,354
No thanks.

354
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,118
No pea soup and no pissing
on my carpet.

355
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,087
Look, it's another
urban legend list.

356
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,258
We got the bright lights
warning,

357
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,199
buried alive,

358
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,999
goatman legend,

359
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,506
kidney theft
and harvesting.

360
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,341
Or how about
the killer in the back seat?

361
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,245
No, no, no...

362
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,715
and a special no
to the goatman.

363
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,344
We need something
scary and cool...

364
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,685
something that'll scare
the crap out of everyone

365
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,088
and will have everyone
talking about my party

366
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,524
for the next six months.

367
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,391
Right.

368
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,357
Amy emailed me.

369
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,992
That bitch.

370
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,902
She wouldn't answer my call
but is emailing you?

371
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,599
Relax.

372
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,334
She emailed me two hours ago.

373
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,569
Well, it better be
a music list.

374
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,448
Come on, already.
What does she have?

375
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,579
Gangsta rap or polka?

376
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,556
Nicole!

377
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,730
Whoa, what is this?

378
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,170
Mary Worth.

379
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,050
- What is that?
- I have no clue.

380
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,748
"This website is devoted

381
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,622
to all those who dare to play
the legendary game Mary Worth."

382
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,820
Wow, look at the crazy icons.

383
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,558
"17th-century Salem court,

384
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,067
Mary Worth was sentenced
to death

385

for the crimes
of witchcraft.

386
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,733
On October 31st her sentence
was carried out.

387

Mary had to endure
brutal beatings for hours

as the townspeople tried
desperately to make her confess

389

who her unborn child's
father was."

390
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,446
Mary Worth,

391
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,286
thou hast been granted
bountiful occasion

392
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:44,055
to divulge the proper name
of thy bastard child.

393
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,586
It yet be the opinion
of this court

394
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,156
that one
who walketh among us

395
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,429
hath made thee a whore.

396
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,700
Thou wilt not confess
to heresy,

397
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:59,607
to having lain
with Satan himself.

398
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,905
If that be thy contention,

399
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,108
then it shall be done

400
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,083
that no man among us

401
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,415
shall yet covet thee again.

402
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,478
No man's loins

403
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,719
shall yet be stirred
by thy countenance.

404
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,996
Mary Worth,

405
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,370
when the last of us
hath made his mark,

406
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,467
if thou hast not confessed,

407
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:37,071
thou shalt be excommunicated
from the church

408
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,844
and left to die.

409
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,626
"The local magistrate felt
the mirror was a just punishment

410
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,893
to remind her that vanity
was the ultimate sin

411
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,127
for her unwillingness
to confess."

412
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,117
"Mary stared into the mirror

413
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,557
and begged whomever lies
within it to take her.

414
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,959
She then cursed the town
and all its people

415
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,587
and vowed to have
her revenge."

416
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,510
"One of the townspeople
that was present

417
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,020
during the execution
was quoted in saying,

418
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,058
'I believe in Mary Worth."'

419
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,455
Fellow citizens,

420
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,755
children of God,

421
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,886
it is a hypocritical legacy

422
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,227
we so-called
Puritans bear.

423
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,563
For there is not
one amongst us

424
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,330
without the stain of sin,

425
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,633
not one who is blameless.

426
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,142
Mankind be wretched
and culpable.

427
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,768
"Now she's trapped
in the mirror

428
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,279
and seeking vengeance,

429
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,178
waiting for someone
to believe in her

430
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,217
and someone to release her."

"Unfortunately,
many have learned

00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,680
there is a dark truth
to Mary's game.

433
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,088
Several poor souls
wrote their names

434
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,149
and those of their friends
onto a mirror

435
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,923
and then, believing
in Mary, in short,

436
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,193
marking themselves
for her vengeance."

437
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,392
Hello?

438
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,564
We are just way
too jumpy tonight.

439
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,163
Nicole?
Nicole!

440
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,538
- Hello.
- Jen?

441
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,044
It's Amy.

442
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,206
- What the hell happened to you?
- Where do I start?

443
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,376
You sound pretty out of it.

444
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,388
I am.
Did Nicole get my email?

445
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,651
- About the website?
- Yeah.

446
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,694
Yeah, I think we found
our game.

447
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,661
No, you didn't.

448
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,198
What are you talking about?
It's perfect.

449
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,824
I just played it.

450
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,494
You did?

451
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,539
So how was it?

452
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,908
I really don't remember.

453
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,444
I think l...

454
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,815
I think I passed out
before I finished counting.

455
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,014
Amy, what happened?

456
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,249
I don't remember
if I finished.

457
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,564
She's gone.

458
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,064
She'll call back.

459
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,602
She played the game.

460
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,070
Sounded like
it freaked her out.

461
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,835
Well, maybe we should
play something else.

462
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,969
You have to be kidding.

463
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,492
Did she call them back?

464
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,833
Well, the police said
that she called Nicole

465
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,465
three more times that night.

466
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,101
But I never spoke
to her again

467
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,611
and I'm not sure
what they said.

468
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,046
Excuse me.

469
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,615
- Hello?
- You sitting down?

470
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,817
Yes.

471
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,689
Sonic scans show
we hit the mother-lode.

472
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,423
You may just be right
about that mass grave.

473
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,897
I'm looking at the first scan
and it's huge.

474
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,763
Almost 30 feet wide.

475
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,998
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Can I call you back?

476
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,834
Something more important
than this?

477
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,430
- Thanks.
- You know what?

478
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,373
I appreciate you
listening, Father.

479
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,434
Sometimes it's just a comfort
to share.

480
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,208
Did you just hang up on me?

481
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,181
You did, didn't you?

482
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,046
Well, if you need an ear,
I'll lend you mine.

483
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,649
Careful, you're the only one
I got now.

484
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,523
I might take you
up on that.

485
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,737
Hi.
My name is Ashley,

486
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,372
and I'm here to play
the mirror game.

487
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,145
Just me and my trusty V-cam
waiting to see Mary.

488
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:24,654
Okay, first I have
to mark myself.

489
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,816
Remember, kiddies,
don't try this at home.

490
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,426
The color red
signifies blood.

491
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,728
I think I'll mark
my friends as well...

492
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:41,636
Kelly and Samantha.

493
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,411
Now the only thing that
is standing between me

494
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,880
becoming the only person

495
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,144
to survive
the Mary Worth legend

496
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,311
is Mary herself.

497
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,720
Bring it on, bitch.

498
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,987
I believe in Mary Worth.

499
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,620
I believe
in Mary Worth.

500
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,756
I believe in Mary Worth.

501
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,700
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

502
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,738
I survived this mirror,
bitch.

503
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,338
- Oh well, so much for that.
- Shh.

504
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,254
What happened?

505
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,223
The site crashed.

506
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,759
Hit the refresh button.
It should bring it back up.

507
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,024
Not sure I want to.

508
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,861
You're out of your mind.
This game is perfect.

509
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,867
It will scare everyone.

510
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,495
And I already have
my first victim in mind.

511
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,562
Who?

512
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,078
Detective Romano.

513
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,478
- Yeah?
- Father O'Neal here to see you.

514
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,177
Oh Jesus.

515
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,778
Send him in.

516
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,955
- Detective Romano?
- Father O'Neal.

517
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,464
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

518
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,502
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

519
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,763
Like I said,
any friend of Ryan's...

520
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,570
- especially a...
- A priest?

521
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,440
Exactly.

522
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,412
Well, I'm trying
to help out the boy.

523
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,075
He seems to be plagued
by some bad dreams.

524
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,881
Look, I told you on the phone,
I'm not homicide anymore.

525
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,923
I understand that.
But if there's anything about the case

526
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,924
that could help me understand
Ryan better...

527
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,584
Nice kid.

528
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,255
Called me every day
for just about over a year.

529
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,423
I felt bad for him
and his folks.

530
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,933
They deserve some closure.

531
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,027
- Was she kidnapped?
- It's a strange case.

532
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,538
No signs of a struggle.

533
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,132
Her bathroom mirror
was shattered, but that's it.

534
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,110
No prints, no blood,
nothing.

535
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,703
She just vanished.

536
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,942
Then why did homicide
investigate it?

537
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,348
At first we didn't.

538
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,718
We were on a case where four kids
got ripped apart at a party.

539
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,155
Blood, guts,
shit over everything.

540
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,216
No bodies.
Witnesses gave us some names,

541
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,955
we did some digging,

542
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,497
found out two of girls
who planned the whole thing

543
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,499
had a friend go missing
the night before.

544
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,695
- Amy.
- Yeah.

545
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,603
Then we find out the whole
thing was a big fucking game

546
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,904
to get some girl back for dating
somebody's ex-boyfriend.

547
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,706
Needless to say,
at first we thought Amy split

548
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,507
because she was part
of the bloodbath.

549
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,605
And what
changed your mind?

550
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,912
It's not completely
made up just yet.

551
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,010
Why not?

552
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:46,545
Look, even though Mary
doesn't remember Amy

553
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,151
at the party that night,
it doesn't mean she wasn't there.

554
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,422
Mary?

555
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,487
Yeah, Mary.

556
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,829
Mary's the girl
they set up.

557
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,731
She's the only one
to survive.

558
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,066
Or at least the only one
that didn't disappear.

559
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,596
It's mainly her testimony that gives us
some insight into that night.

560
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,007
But she was whacked out
on so much LSD

561
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,978
that her story's more comic-book lore
than testimony.

562
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,608
They put her in a psychiatric hospital
for a couple years.

563
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,812
- They never charged her.
- For what?

564
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,788
- Murder.
- You think she did it?

565
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,950
Only one with a motive.

566
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,927
- And what's that?
- Revenge for the game.

567
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,486
And she was the one dating
one of the girl's exes

568
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,293
that went MIA that night.

569
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,768
You mentioned some testimony
from someone else.

570
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,430
Yeah, Nicole's brother.

571
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,303
He overheard
a few conversations

572
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,172
the girls had about hazing
Mary at the party that night.

573
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,938
- Why Mary?
- Why not?

574
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,712
Her mom's been ragging on her
the past couple of months,

575
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,311
um, her father
split last year.

576
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,720
Her mom's
a complete nutcase.

577
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,816
Exactly.

578
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:59,021
Look, she's got a lot
of crap to deal with.

579
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,724
- So let's prank someone else.
- No!

580
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,500
This isn't about Matt,
is it?

581
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,799
I don't give a crap
about Matt.

582
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,964
If Mary wants to have
my leftovers,

583
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,167
- she can have it.
- Mary said...

584
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,335
I don't give a crap
about what Mary said.

585
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,574
I'll call you when I get home.
Meg should be back by 1:00.

586
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,344
Don't let Amy creep you out.
She's just in one of her moods.

587
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,644
Now learn your lines.
Use the mirror if you have to.

588
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,587
You need to come off
convincing.

589
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,217
Your job is to make sure
Mary takes the dare.

590
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,526
Look, I have nothing
against Mary.

591
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,962
She's the new kid.

592
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:38,126
And the rules are:
all the new kids get screwed first.

593
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,629
- Fine.
- Call you later.

594
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,943
Okay.

595
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,508
Have you ever heard of
the legend of Mary Worth?

596
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,775
Not many people have.

597
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,409
Well, not anymore anyway.

598
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,249
After so many
unexplained deaths

599
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,289
to those who played
"the game"

600
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,654
no one ever dared tell
anyone how to play.

601
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,659
Till now.

602
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:14,185
I dare you to stand alone
in the dark

603
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,755
with a candle
and say...

604
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,894
"I believe in Mary Worth."

605
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,569
I believe...

606
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,739
- in Mary Worth.

607
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,594
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Idiot!

608
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,696
You almost gave me
a freaking heart attack.

609
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,206
Sorry,
but I've gots to go.

610
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,209
I should make you
piss on yourself.

611
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,006
What's with the mirror?

612
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,775
It's none of your
damn business.

613
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,821
So Nicole played
the game as well?

614
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,255
Yeah.
Apparently she's responsible

615
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,315
for starting this whole
fucking thing.

616
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,917
How so?

617
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,054
From what I remember,

618
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,598
you can actually mark others
when you play this thing.

619
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,396
- Like a curse?
- Yeah.

620
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,835
Nicole marked her friends.

621
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,770
All but one went missing.

622
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,831
There was another girl?

623
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,707
Yeah.
Um, Maggie.

624
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,048
Hello.

625
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,609
I'm back.

626
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,453
Okay, you call Amy
and I'll call Maggie.

627
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,584
Okay.

628
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,720
Hey, is everything
all right?

629
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,594
Yeah.
Yeah.

630
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,157
It's just...

631
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,800
forget it.

632
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,568
Okay, I'll call Maggie.

633
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,276
Maggie!

634
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,457
Maggie.

635
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,561
Maggie!

636
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,324
What?

637
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,331
Maggie!

638
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,196
Jeez, what?

639
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,609
Maggie, damn it, don't you
hear me calling you?

640
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,321
Hello.

641
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,486
Hey, it's us.
We need to talk.

642
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,122
The party is less
than 18 hours away.

643
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,928
I need my pills, damn it.

644
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,265
I said I'm coming.

645
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,794
God, why do I have to do
everything around here?

646
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,410
Maggie.

647
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,639
Mom?

648
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,906
Mom?

649
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,513
Reggae or hip-hop?

650
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,519
Maggie?
Have you been listening?

651
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,698
Hello?

652
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,006
I'm still here.

653
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,706
- Did you hear that?
- I think we lost Meg.

654
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,182
No, it sounded like
Meg yelling.

655
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,152
Hold on, I've got Amy
on the other line.

656
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,314
- Hello?
- Nice of you to call back.

657
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,484
Sorry.
It's been a weird night.

658
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,427
Tell us about it.
We've been jumpy all night.

659
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,623
Look, I'll try
Meg's home number.

660
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,861
Jen, it's like
past midnight.

661
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,772
- Maggie, what is the matter?
- No no no no!

662
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,569
Maggie? Maggie, stop it.
Stop, please.

663
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,110
Maggie, stop it.
What is wrong?

664
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,245
Maggie, stay here
and don't move.

665
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,752
- Hello?
- Hey, is Maggie...

666
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,281
Maggie!

667
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,422
Maggie, stop it.

668
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,931
Maggie, stop it, baby.

669
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,058
Stop it.
No. No.

670
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,763
What is the matter?
Maggie. Maggie, stop.

671
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,897
Stop.
Stop, please, Maggie.

672
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,669
Stop it.
What is wrong?

673
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,311
What happened
to the two girls?

674
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,747
Mary and Maggie?

675
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,081
I think they're still
in a psych ward upstate

676
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,122
plagued with visions
and nightmares of Mary Worth.

677
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,714
Last I heard they had
them isolated

678
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,317
in rooms without mirrors
or reflective surfaces.

679
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,521
Sounds like whatever
happened to them

680
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,963
is happening to Ryan
in a milder form.

681
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,330
Yeah, but from
what I remember

682
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,494
Ryan never actually
played the game.

683
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,969
Neither did Maggie.

684
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,199
Yeah, but apparently she
was marked by Nicole.

685
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,141
Well, thanks for taking
the time to meet with me.

686
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,114
I know you're busy.

687
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,117
If it was another day,
you know I could...

688
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,016
No need to explain.
I understand.

689
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,292
Seems this game has some type
of placebo effect on those that play it.

690
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,489
Or those that have been told they've
been marked by someone else.

691
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,826
But Maggie didn't know.

692
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,333
I know. It's puzzled me
all these years.

693
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,892
Maybe it's no placebo.

694
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,477
Fucking nut.

695
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,138
How long?

696
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,878
Okay. Can you arrange for me
to speak with her?

697
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,216
I'd hate to make
the two-hour trip for nothing.

698
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,188
Thanks.

699
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,459
I'm so sorry.

700
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,592
I can't believe
you hung up on me.

701
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,763
I'm so sorry, Clair. I had a pressing
issue I was dealing with.

702
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,432
How about a return call?

703
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,567
Well, I'm still sort of
dealing with it.

704
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,168
I'm not going to begin

705
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,612
to tell you how upset
and frustrated I am.

706
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,708
No, you know what?
Actually, I will.

707
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,447
One would think that
the head archeologist

708
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,955
of an important dig
that he is heading up

709
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,116
would have the decency
of showing up

710
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,888
to approve the plans
instead of some student aide.

711
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,658
But you know what?
It could be forgiven

712
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,394
if, say, the site were on
the other side of the planet

713
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,129
and the scientist
were needed

714
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:02,671
because he was giving up
a kidney for an orphan child.

715
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,366
I know how you feel.

716
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:08,002
But no, actually, this site
is within walking distance

717
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,774
of his office
and on school grounds.

718
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,611
This is just as important, Clair.
Trust me.

719
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,584
Need I remind you
that one of the reasons

720
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,382
the school brought you
in on this

721
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,855
was so that you could
organize and structure

722
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,358
- the church's history here?
- No, you don't.

723
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,724
Then I take it
you're on your way back here.

724
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,389
No, actually
I'm going upstate

725
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,990
to visit a patient
at a psychiatric hospital.

726
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,300
You are kidding.

727
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,830
Clair, I trust you.
I trained you.

728
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,206
I feel you have full control
of the situation

729
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,473
and I'm confident
you'll do just fine.

730
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,446
You cannot be...

731
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,485
you are serious.

732
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,645
I'll call you
when I'm on my way back.

733
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,290
Hello?

734
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,095
Hello!?

735
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,469
What?

736
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,781
# Baby, I got my feet
pointed right at you... #

737
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,492
What's going on, man?

738
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,622
Are you all right?

739
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,533
Yeah, I'm all right.

740
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,136
If she's not gonna put up with the baggage,
she's not worth it.

741
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,734
Yeah, but I can't either.

742
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,206
Yeah.

743
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,175
He doesn't deserve you.

744
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,048
You've got something
called integrity.

745
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,785
And he needs to get
his shit together.

746
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,726
His problems are his own
and not yours.

747
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:15,236
Hey, a few of us are going
across the street.

748
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,739
You should come.

749
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:22,711
Did it ever occur to him
that he needs to just do it?

750
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,872
You know, maybe you should
just get it over with.

751
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,916
What?

752
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,076
Play the fucking game.

753
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,761
Thank you, Mary, for taking
the time to meet with me.

754
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,407
Mary, I really don't want
to disturb you.

755
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,395
So where do we start?

756
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,551
It was Mary.

757
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,353
She did it.
She did it.

758
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:22,028
She made me watch.

759
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,098
What did she do?

760
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,403
She took them.

761
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,847
Where did she take them?

762
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,453
Into her world.

763
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,623
Reflections...

764
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,132
she keeps them there.

765
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,829
Tortures them.

766
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,237
What does she want?

767
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:08,704
Revenge.

768
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:30,323
Thank God. I thought the power was
going to be out all night.

769
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,391
Are you sure you won't
change your mind?

770
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,561
I'm not sure about
anything anymore.

771
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,504
What?
You cannot be serious.

772
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,235
Even after all
that's happened tonight?

773
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,470
Look, Jen's not listening.

774
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:44,445
I don't care, Nikki.
Screw her party. I'm not going.

775
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,574
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

776
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,348
Fine, I can't stop you.

777
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,754
But whatever you do,
just don't dare Mary.

778
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,485
Okay?

779
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,584
Look, I tried it
a few minutes ago.

780
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,959
- We're fine.
- What?

781
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,056
I just played it.
Nothing happened

782
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,068
Don't tell me
you marked yourself.

783
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,036
Nicole!

784
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,938
For Christ's sake, tell me
you didn't mark yourself.

785
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:17,071
It's no big deal.
Nothing happened.

786
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,080
Oh really?

787
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,879
Wait, who else
did you mark?

788
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,054
You marked us?

789
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,421
You marked me, Meg
and even stupid-ass Jen?

790
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,357
Look what happened to Meg.

791
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:32,826
I didn't do
anything to Meg.

792
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,591
Yes, you did!
Why did you mark me?

793
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,998
- You played it too.
- I didn't mark you.

794
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,628
I didn't mark you!

795
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,763
Ugh.

796
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:03,989
# Let me know #

797
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,928
# How to let go #

798
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:13,298
# Life's dragging
me around #

799
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:21,175
# Face down #

800
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:29,682
# On a life that's long
past gone #

801
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:36,523
# Incomplete #

802
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:40,551
# Take a stab or retreat #

803
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:45,829
# Can't make up my mind #

804
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:53,003
# I rewind #

805
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:02,446
# The footsteps
that led me here #

806
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:10,091
# To mourn #

807
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,720
# What's dead and gone #

808
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,993
# Mourn #

809
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:25,604
# Mourn #

810
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,836
# Try moving on #

811
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:33,678
# Mourn #

812
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:57,232
# When you're incomplete #

813
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:05,140
# And you can't retreat #

814
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:13,685
# Just accept defeat #

815
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:21,352
# And mourn #

816
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,227
# Mourn #

817
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,973
# Mourn. #

818
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,725
# Anti-drug
and I stopped myself #

819
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,995
# Can you help me out? #

820
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,478
# Voices say #

821
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,881
# Get out of my way #

822
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,318
# Voices say #

823
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:23,916
# It's safe to say... #

824
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,018
Jamie?

825
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,575
Jamie?

826
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,288
He-hello?

827
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:48,702
- Hello?
- Did you just call?

828
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,837
No.

829
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,540
Forget it.

830
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,480
Amy's not coming.

831
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,313
What?

832
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,785
Wait, I'll get her on.
Hold on.

833
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,552
Amy? Hi.

834
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,858
Nicole just told me
you're not coming tomorrow.

835
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,398
- Why?
- I have a bad feeling about this.

836
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,197
Everything is already set.
You can't back down now.

837
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,138
All you have to do is make sure
no one goes into my parent's bedroom

838
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,937
Nicole will make sure Mary
goes into the bathroom

839
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,978
and John and Gary
will take it from there.

840
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,070
You can leave right after.

841
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,378
- No.
- Damn, Amy. What is with you?

842
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,385
I don't want
any part of this.

843
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,547
Nothing is going to happen.

844
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,817
Nothing.
It's a prank.

845
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,519
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
Especially me.

846
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,960
You're acting like a child.

847
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,930
Look, she doesn't want
any part of it.

848
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,126
Don't come to her rescue.

849
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:48,796
She's a big girl.
She found the site, for Christ's sake.

850
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,805
What if she doesn't
take the dare?

851
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,900
Oh, she will.
Nicole will make sure of it.

852
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,208
And if she doesn't, fine.

853
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,441
We'll pick someone else
at the party, okay?

854
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,447
Okay.

855
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,387
Nicole?

856
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,886
Fine.

857
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,666
I trust you have good news.

858
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,334
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm at the church.

859
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,378
No, you're not,
because I'm...

860
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,572
standing at the church.

861
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,651
What?

862
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,922
I'm sorry, Clair. I had
something fall into my lap.

863
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,123
Well, I hope you
have strong knees

864
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,927
because I'm about
to throw some more on.

865
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,195
- What happened?
- We found something.

866
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,861
What did you find?

867
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,098
Have you ever heard of
the legend of Mary Worth?

868
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,835
It's come up.
Why?

869
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,473
We found
Reverend Whittaker's diary.

870
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,779
And you're never going
to believe what it says.

871
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:19,984
It was under the bones?

872
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,791
Peter uncovered
a leather flap

873
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,957
sticking out from under
a child's skull.

874
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,462
How much have you read?

875
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,471
Just the last entry. It was enough
to know it was Whittaker's

876
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,030
and that it was something
much worse than a plague

877
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,134
or a pox that killed
that town.

878
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:44,013
And they also
found this.

879
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,692
I awoke this morning
with the intention

880
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:59,097
that life in Idlewood
could now have peace

881
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:02,865
after such a wretched
and painfully long trial of Mary.

882
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,702
My heart
has been cut in two

883
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,937
and by none other
than my own hand.

884
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,205
I have purchased
the vanity mirror

885
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:15,114
that had been used
in Mary's torture.

886
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,118
That should be adequate.
This way.

887
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:19,416
I do not know why I do this.

888
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:23,681
My hope is
to somehow forgive myself

889
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,990
and settle thy soul
in some matter.

890
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,992
But truth be
the guilty cannot resist

891
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,501
torturing themselves.

892
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,569
I spend days just staring
at the mirror

893
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:43,237
hoping to see her face
just once more.

894
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,844
Mary had vowed revenge
upon the town

895
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,885
for wrongfully killing her.

896
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,153
What irony that she useth
my own hand

897
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:56,885
who haddeth condemned
her fate

898
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,927
as the instrument
of her wrath.

899
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,913
When Mary released
her hold of my mind

900
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:57,612
I was covered in the blood
of my townspeople.

901
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,720
I buried the mirror
and the bodies

902
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,259
in hope that I could prevent
Mary's wrath

903
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,488
upon future generations.

904
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,724
I can only pray
this be enough

905
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,266
to absolve my stain of sin.

906
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,275
Why do I always find myself
getting dragged into something

907
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:27,338
ridiculous when you
get that look?

908
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,877
I think I know
how to help Ryan.

909
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,752
Ryan?

910
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,087
- I'm gonna need your help.
- Who's Ryan?

911
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,185
- He's the boy with the nightmares.
- What are you talking about?

912
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:42,321
Nothing. I need you to get me
this document.

913
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,764
- Okay.
- It's gonna be easy.

914
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,802
And you'll need to permanently
borrow it and meet me here tonight with it.

915
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,732
What?

916
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,833
I need you to acquire it from
the church's historic documents.

917
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,344
- Are you insane?
- 100%.

918
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,246
- Where are you going now?
- I think Ryan needs to be here.

919
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:31,903
It's Ryan. Leave your info,
I'll get back to you when I can.

920
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,744
Ryan, it's Father O'Neal.
Call me when you get this.

921
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,101
Yes, hello.
I'm Professor O'Neal.

922
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,331
I need to get ahold
of one of my students.

923
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,632
I need an address.
His phone isn't working.

924
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,112
Can I help you
with something?

925
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,384
I'm looking for Ryan.
Can you tell me where I can find him?

926
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,288
- He left.
- What do you mean?

927
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,121
He quit school
and he took off.

928
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,425
You're just gonna give up?
You're just gonna walk out like that?

929
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,829
It's not normal to wake up every morning
screaming my fucking head off.

930
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,093
No, you're right.
It's not.

931
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,930
I can't handle it
here anymore, man.

932
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,664
Um, that's it, man.

933
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,502
Cool, take care.

934
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:42,510
Did it ever occur to him
that he needs to just do it?

935
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,409
Maybe you should
just get it over with.

936
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,141
Play the fucking game.

937
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,211
Why?

938
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,019
I'm not the one to ask.

939
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,023
I need to find him.

940
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,651
Ask Rachel.
She might know.

941
01:14:58,727 --> 01:14:59,921
Where can I find her?

942
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,792
She works over
at the soup kitchen.

943
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:04,332
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah, you bet.

944
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,439
- Rachel?
- Yes?

945
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,377
I'm Father O'Neal.

946
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,608
Father O'Neal, hello.

947
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,946
What can I do for you?

948
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,043
I'm looking for Ryan.

949
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,250
He left.

950
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:32,122
I know, I know. I need to get
ahold of him. It's important.

951
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,628
I tried talking to him

952
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,288
but he just won't listen.

953
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,492
If somebody
doesn't listen,

954
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:40,694
then maybe you
need to listen to them.

955
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:48,071
His parents live about
two hours west from here.

956
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:51,203
If he's heading home
he might still be at the bus stop.

957
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,214
I know there's two busses
that run every day.

958
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:57,548
I think there's still one going
in about half an hour.

959
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,087
Okay, thanks.

960
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,713
Father!

961
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,690
Yes?

962
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,162
If you see him,
will you tell him I'm sorry?

963
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,688
I'll tell him, but that's something
you need to tell him yourself.

964
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,542
Hello?

965
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,519
I'm having
some difficulties.

966
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,215
What's wrong?

967
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:36,382
First it was morals
and ethics.

968
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,050
Now we've moved up
to grand larceny.

969
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,388
Did you find it?

970
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:43,022
Yes, and it's not as easy
to take as you thought.

971
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,862
I don't understand. It's probably
in the basement. What's the issue?

972
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,993
The issue is

973
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:51,471
the school is having a field day
with this archeological dig

974
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,235
you're supposed
to be supervising.

975
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,833
They've decided to take
anything that looks old

976
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,573
and dates back to the early
days and put it on display

977
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:01,445
- all around the school.
- And?

978
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,713
And it's currently behind glass

979
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,482
and under surveillance.

980
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,616
You know what?
I wish I could help you

981
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:13,126
but I'm not going
to prison over it.

982
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,163
Look, Clair, I'm not sure
how you can pull this off,

983
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,130
but I need you
to get that document.

984
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,794
I can't believe you.
I'm not risking my job.

985
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,461
This is more important
than your job.

986
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,402
What could be
more important?

987
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,306
Your soul.

988
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,037
Ryan!

989
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,211
Ryan!

990
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,683
What are you doing here?

991
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,888
I should be
asking you.

992
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,193
I'm done.
I can't take it any longer.

993
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,256
I'm sick of hurting all
the people that care about me.

994
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,892
I believe I found a way
to end the nightmares.

995
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,493
I just hope it's not too late.

996
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,561
It is.

997
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:59,300
I don't believe so.

998
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:02,172
Mary Worth was excommunicated
from the church falsely.

999
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:04,576
Okay, so?

1000
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,581
So she's trapped in limbo.
If I destroy the papers

1001
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,480
and reinduct her back
into the church,

1002
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,178
she'll have a door
to leave through.

1003
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,118
She was also killed
in front of a mirror...

1004
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:17,386
a mirror she uses as a portal
between our two worlds.

1005
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,586
Mary's mirror needs
to be destroyed

1006
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,629
and I think you should be
the one to do it.

1007
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,859
All right, people.
You have to clear this area, all right?

1008
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,194
It may be a false alarm,
but don't stick around to find out.

1009
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,596
Let's move it.

1010
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:19,115
# I'm the beater #

1011
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:22,418
# On the drum #

1012
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,016
# Getting weaker #

1013
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,688
# Getting numb #

1014
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,255
# Never laughing #

1015
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,598
# I never know #

1016
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,229
# Heaven won't you help me #

1017
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,136
# Save my soul? #

1018
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,835
# The more I change #

1019
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:47,781
# The more I stay the same #

1020
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:54,419
# The more I change, yeah #

1021
01:19:56,324 --> 01:20:00,556
# The more I stay the same #

1022
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,266
# I have nothing #

1023
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,966
# Left to say... #

1024
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,641
- You have it?
- Have I ever let you down?

1025
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,503
- That's Ryan.
- Mmm.

1026
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,954
Let's get this over with.

1027
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,991
Wait, what?
What over with?

1028
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,192
Clair, the mirror
must be broken.

1029
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:44,528
- There is no other way.
- Fine.

1030
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:46,191
Release her.

1031
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:52,163
- What is he talking about?
- You know that's seven years bad luck.

1032
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,673
It'll be all right.

1033
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,175
And I can pretty much
guarantee that.

1034
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,734
Oh, not the mirror.

1035
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,094
What the...?

1036
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,430
Ryan, what's the problem?

1037
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,800
Something's got ahold
of my hand! Ahh!

1038
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,771
Ryan, throw it!

1039
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,602
Throw it!
Hurry!

1040
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,587
- She's preventing us from breaking it.
- How can she do that?

1041
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,856
I'm out of here.

1042
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,659
Clair, get the rock.

1043
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,270
Now throw it!
Throw it!

1044
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,693
Oh, what the...?

1045
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:26,131
Shit! God!
Go!

1046
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:56,219
Get off me!
Get the fuck off me!

1047
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:58,561
Get off!
Help!

1048
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,701
That bitch
messed up my hair.

1049
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:43,036
Clair, you truly are
one of a kind.

1050
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,839
Thank you, Ryan.

1051
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:40,994
Is that it?

1052
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,764
One more thing.

1053
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,451
What?

1054
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:40,453
No nightmare.

1055
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:42,921
Mmm, so it worked?

1056
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,255
It did.

1057
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,920
You should call
Father O'Neal.

1058
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,563
Yeah, I think I will.

1059
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,066
I'm gonna go
take a shower.

1060
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:01,403
Okay.

1061
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:03,171
Mmwha!

1062
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:12,779
Hey, so my roommates
don't attack.

1063
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:16,250
How sweet.

1064
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:24,229
Hello?

1065
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,132
- Hey, it's Ryan.
- Well?

1066
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,863
Well, it worked.
No nightmare.

1067
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:33,703
That's great. I was worried after
I talked to your roommate.

1068
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:41,641
Why?

1069
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,187
He told me how he pressured you
into playing the game.

1070
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,554
Yeah, but I never played.

1071
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,466
But I saw lipstick
on the mirror.

1072
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,169
I never played.

1073
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:04,534
Could anybody else have?

1074
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:12,543
Um...

1075
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:15,446
well, the only one that knows
how to play would be Rachel.

1076
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,143
But she was never here.

1077
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:20,517
Rachel.

1078
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,988
Hello?

1079
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:33,666
Your roommate said she stopped by
looking for you after you left.

1080
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:11,033
# There's a girl
that I met the other night #

1081
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:13,369
# She's so beautiful
and perfect #

1082
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:15,671
# Yeah, I think that she
is right for me #

1083
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:19,076
# But there's another girl
that I like too #

1084
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:21,672
# She's intelligent
and sweet #

1085
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,808
# Best of all
she looks like you #

1086
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:25,785
# And we went out #

1087
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:32,350
# And then there's Jennifer
who I met at the dance #

1088
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,486
# But I found out
she's into girls #

1089
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,122
# So I don't think I stand
a chance with her #

1090
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,134
# So tell me now
just where the hell I am #

1091
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,727
# I wonder why things
never worked out #

1092
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,295
# Just the way we planned #

1093
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:48,706
# 'Cause every time
I'd think about a girl #

1094
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:54,146
# When a good girl
comes along #

1095
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:56,149
# Then another girl steps in #

1096
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:58,447
# And the cycle,
it begins again #

1097
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,716
# And everything comes
crashing to the ground #

1098
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:04,053
# When I fool around #

1099
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:15,163
# There's a girl, yeah,
she's really got me down #

1100
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,704
# I used to think about her
always #

1101
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,070
# Except when she
was out of town #

1102
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:24,043
# I used to think that we
were meant to be #

1103
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:28,013
# But now she says she never
really cared too much for me #

1104
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:31,574
# 'Cause every time
I'd think about a girl #

1105
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:36,885
# When a good girl
comes along #

1106
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,983
# Then another girl steps in #

1107
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,324
# And the cycle,
it begins again #

1108
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:44,558
# And everything comes
crashing to the ground #

1109
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:46,657
# When I fool around. #

1110
