Subtitle by: Tarun

2
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Are you sure you're eighteen?
- Why? Do I look older?

3
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,600
Alberta Scrubb?
- It's a typographical error

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,000
- It is suppose to be Albert A. Scrubb.
- Edmund, you are suppose to be helping
me with the groceries.

5
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,600
Better luck next time, ay, squirt?

6
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,200
Squirt? He barely had 2 years on me!

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,299
I am a king. I've fought wars
and I've led armies.

8
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,800
Not in this world.
- Yeah, instead i'm stuck here.

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,500
Doing battles with useless Clarence Scrubb.

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
If anyone so deserve the name.

11
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,200
What are you doing?

12
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Nothing.
Come on then.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Dear Diary.
It is now day 253.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,200
since my ratchet cousins
Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.

15
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,100
Not sure how much long i can cope
living with them.

16
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Hard to share my things.

17
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,500
If only one could treat relatives like
one who treat insects,

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,900
all my problems would be solved.
I could simply put them in a jar.

19
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,300
Pin them to my wall?
- I'm home!

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,700
- Hello?
- Note to self.

21
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,800
Investigate legal ramifications
of impaling relatives.

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,000
And that concludes the war news from the western front.
- Hi, Uncle Harold.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,100
I've tried to find some carrots
but all they had were turnips again.

24
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,900
Should I start making soup?
And Alberta is on her way home.

25
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,700
Uncle Harold?
- Father.

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,900
Edward making faces at you.

27
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Why, you little...
- Father, he's going to hit me.

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,300
Edmund look, it's from Susan.

29
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,500
I do wish you were here with us.
It is such an adventure.

30
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,200
But nothing like our times in Narnia.
America is very exciting.

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,700
Only we never see father.
He works so very hard.

32
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,200
I was invited to the British consul's
tea party this week by a naval officer.

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Who happens to be very handsome.
I think he fancies me.

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,300
It seems that the Germans have made the
crossing difficult right now.

35
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Time are hard. Mother hopes you both won't mind

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,700
another few months in Cambridge.

37
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,200
Another few months?
How will we survive?

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,600
You're lucky. At least you've got your own room.
I'm stuck with mullet mouth.

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,900
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.

40
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Off on adventures.
- Yeah. They are the olders we are the youngest.

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,300
We don't matter as much.

42
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,100
Do you think i look anything like Susan?

43
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,000
Lucy, have you seen this ship before?
- Yes, it's very Narnian looking isn't it?

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Yeah. Just another reminder that we're here
not there.

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,200
There once was two orphans who wasted their time.

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,400
believing in Narnian nursery rhyme.

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Please let me hit him!
- No.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Don't you ever knock?
- It's my house.

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
I do as I please. You're just guests.

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
What's so fascinating about that picture anyway?
It's hideous.

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
You won't see it from the outside of the door.

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,100
Edmund look, looks like the water is actually moving.

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,000
What rubbish, see? That's what happens when you
read all those fancy little novels and fairy tales of yours.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,300
There once was a boy called Eustace, who read books
for facts which were worthless.

55
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,900
People who read fairy tales are always a sort of becoming
a hideous burden compared to people like me.

56
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,700
I read books with real information.
- A hideous burden?

57
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,800
I haven't seen you lift a finger
since we've been here.

58
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,800
I hope you won't mind I tell your father it was you
who stole Aunt Alberta sweets?

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,200
- Liar?
- Really?

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,000
- Edmund, the painting!
- I found them under your bed.

61
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,200
And you know what? I've licked every one of them!

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,100
Ew! I'm infected with you!

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,300
What is going on here?
- Lucy, do you think...

64
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,800
This is some kind of a trick. Stop or I'll tell mother.

65
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,600
Mother!

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,100
I'll just smash the whole thing.

67
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,200
Do something!
- No.

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,900
Help me.
- Let me go.

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,000
Let go.

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,400
Eustace, swim!
- What's going on?

71
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,700
Swimming!

72
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
Swim.

73
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,300
It's alright! I got you.

74
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
Caspian?
- Lucy.

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Edmund, it is Caspian.
- You're safe now.

76
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Are we in Narnia?
- Yes, you are in Narnia.

77
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,500
I don't wanna go. I want to go back to England!
I'm going back to England!

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,600
Hold on.

79
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,500
That was thrilling!

80
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,900
How in the world do you end up here?
- I have no idea.

81
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,000
- Caspian!
- Edmund.

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
It's great to see you.
- Didn't you call for us?

83
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,900
No, not this time.

84
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,100
Well, whatever the case, i'm just glad to be here.

85
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,500
Ahh! Get that thing off me!

86
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,400
Reepicheep!

87
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Your Majesty.
- Hello, Reep.

88
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,400
What a pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine sir.

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,500
But first, what to do about this,
this hysterical interloper?

90
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,500
That giant rat thing just tried to claw my
face off!

91
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,800
I was merely trying to expel the water from
your lungs sir.

92
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,300
He talks! Does anyone understand? He just talk!
- He always talks.

93
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Actually its getting him to shut up that's the trick.

94
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,500
The moment there is nothing to be said your highness,
I promise you I will not say it.

95
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,600
I don't know what kind of prank this is.
I wanna wake up right now!

96
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Perhaps we can throw him back?

97
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,600
And being abducted by a kind
of zeepiratencarnival.

98
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,700
I demand to know just where in the blazes am I?

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,500
You're on the Dawn Treader.
The finest ship in Narnia's navy.

100
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,800
Was it something I said?

101
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,700
See to him for me.
- Your majesty.

102
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,400
Men.

103
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Behold our castaways.

104
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,300
Edmund the Just
and Lucy the Valiant.

105
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,900
High King and Queen of Narnia.

106
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,800
Aslan.

107
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
Look! Susan's bow and arrows.

108
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,900
- Lucy
- My Healing Cordial and dagger.

109
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,300
oh, May I?
- Of course. They are yours.

110
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,800
Peter's sword.
- Yes.

111
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
I looked after as promised.

112
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,900
Here.
Hold it if you wish.

113
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,100
No, it's yours.
Peter has given it to you.

114
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,200
I did saved this for you though.

115
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,100
Thanks.

116
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,600
Since you've left, the Giants in the North
had surrendered unconditionally.

117
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,900
And we defeated the Calormen army of the
great desert.

118
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,800
There is peace across all of Narnia.
- Peace?

119
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
For three years.

120
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,100
And have you found yourself a queen in those
three years?

121
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,300
No. Not one to compare to your sister.

122
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,600
Hang on, so there are no wars to fight
and no one is in trouble...

123
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,300
Then, why are we here?
- That's a good question.

124
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
I have been asking myself the same thing.

125
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
So, where are we sailing?
- To get back the throne from my uncle.

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,700
He tried to kill my father's closest friends and
most loyal supporters.

127
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,000
The seven Lords of Telmar.

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,500
They fled to the Lone Islands.

129
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,900
No one has heard from them since.

130
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,800
So you think something has happened to them?
- Well, if it has...

131
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
It is my duty to find out.

132
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
What lies east of the Lone Islands?

133
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Uncharted waters. Things that
you can barely imagine.

134
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,500
Tales of sea serpents and worse.

135
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,200
Sea serpents?
- Alright captain, enough of your tall tales.

136
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Where skies i want to be, where the waves are sweet.

137
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,000
Descends upon you, Reepicheep.

138
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,000
That's pretty!
- oh! Thank you.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A "driad" sung to me when i was just a "materling".

140
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,300
I can't divine the meaning but i never forgotten
the words.

141
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,500
What do you think past Lone islands is?

142
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
I've been told the furthest east one can sail
is to the end of the world.

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Aslan's country.
- Do you really believe there is such a place?

144
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,300
We have nothing if we do not believe.

145
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,700
Do you think you can actually sail there?

146
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Well, there is only one way of finding that out.

147
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,500
Only hope one day I'd earn the right to see it.

148
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Your majesty.

149
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,700
You have grown stronger, my friend.

150
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
Seems I have.

151
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Alright! Back to work.

152
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,600
Edmund, Do you think if we keep sailing
to the end of the world, we just...

153
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
tip off the edge?

154
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Don't worry, Lu.
We're long way from there.

155
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
I see you're still talking nonsense.

156
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,400
Are you feeling better?
- Yes, but not thanks to you.

157
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,700
It's like I have an iron constitution.
- You're ever "vesitence" ever I see. (?)

158
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Found your sea legs?
- Never lost them.

159
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,100
It's just given a shock of things. (?)

160
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,900
Obviously have the cutest position, (?)
due to my intelligence.

161
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,400
I don't think he has "apute" anything (?)

162
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,600
I'll have you know as soon as
I find civilization.

163
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm contacting the British Consulate.
Having you arrested for kidnapping.

164
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Kidnapping is it? That's funny.
I thought we had saved your life.

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You held me here against my own will!
- Did I?

166
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,100
(???) in that quarters
It's like a zoo down there!

167
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,200
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?
- He is just warming up.

168
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Landfall.

169
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
The Lone Islands.
Narrow Haven's portal.

170
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Strange. No Narnia flag in sight.

171
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,700
The Lone Islands
always been of Narnia's.

172
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,400
Seems suspicious.

173
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I say we prepare a party

174
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Drinian?
- Forgive me, Your Majesty...

175
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,600
But the chain of command starts with Prince Caspian
on this ship

176
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,500
Right
- We use rowboats. Drinian, pick some men and come
on shore.

177
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,100
Men the row boats! Throw the sailer and prepare to
go out.

178
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and get ready to lower the anchor.

179
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,100
En route! (??) lies ahead.

180
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,400
Can't we just wait till the morning?

181
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,400
There is no honor in turning away from adventure land.

182
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Listen!
Where is everyone?

183
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,200
Come on, jelly legs.
- I'm capable of getting out myself!

184
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,500
And you're certain you're related by blood?

185
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,100
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men
and secure the place.

186
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,100
We will head up.

187
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,500
If we don't come back by dawn,

188
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,300
send the party.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

189
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,100
Yeah, looks like nobody is in.
So do you think we should go back?

190
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you want to come here and guard...something?

191
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Ah, yes.
Good idea, cousin.

192
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Very..um, logical.

193
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,800
I've got it.
Don't worry.

194
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I'm ready to go when you are!

195
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,800
Who are all these people?
- Why are they've been crossed out?

196
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,400
Looks like some kind of fee..?
- Slave Traders.

197
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,900
Look out.

198
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,300
Unless you want to hear this scum squeal like
a girl again,

199
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,600
I would say, you should drop your weapons.

200
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm not a girl.
- Now!

201
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,500
Put it down!
- Useless..

202
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,200
Put them in irons.
- Come here you!

203
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Get your hands off me. Let go!

204
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Take these two to the market.
Send those other two to the dungeons.

205
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
Listen to me, you insolent fool.
I am your king!

206
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
You're gonna pay for that!
- Actually...

207
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,200
someone else is going to pay.

208
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,100
For all of you.

209
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,200
You all right?
- Yeah.

210
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It is hopeless.
You'll never get out.

211
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,000
Who's there?
- Nobody.

212
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Just a voice in my head.

213
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Lord Bern?

214
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,900
That was me once.
I do not deserve that title anymore.

215
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
Is he one of the seven?

216
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,400
Your face. You remind me of
a king that I once know.

217
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,900
That man was my father.

218
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,300
My Lord, please forgive me.

219
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
No, please.

220
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,800
No!

221
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,800
- Mommy!
Get back.

222
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,600
Stay with daddy.
- Don't worry. I will find you!

223
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Mommy!

224
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,400
Where are they taking them?
- Keep watching.

225
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
What happened?
- It's a sacrifice.

226
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,100
Where did they go?
- No one knows.

227
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,900
The mist was first seen in the east.

228
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,700
Reports of fishermen and sailors
disappearing out at sea.

229
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,900
We lords have made a pact...

230
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,800
to find the source of the mist
and to destroy them.

231
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
They each set sail,

232
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,300
But none of them came back.

233
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,700
You see, If they don't sell you to the slave
traders

234
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,200
You're likely to be fed to the mist
- We have to find Lucy.

235
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,700
Before it's too late.
- I offer 60.

236
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,300
I bid 80!
- 100 for the little lady.

237
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,800
120!
- 150.

238
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,100
Anymore bids?

239
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,500
SOLD!

240
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Come on, move!

241
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,800
And now, for this fine speciment!

242
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,700
Who'd kick off the bidding?

243
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Come on now, he may not seem like much,
but uh..he is strong.

244
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Yes, he's strong alright. Smells like
the rear end of a Minotaur.

245
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,000
That is an outrageous lie.

246
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,000
I won the school hygeine award,
two years running!

247
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
Come on, someone make your bid!
- I'll take them off your hands.

248
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I'll take them all out of your hands.

249
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,400
For Narnia!

250
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,000
Thanks, Reep. I knew you would come.
- Your Highness.

251
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,400
Grab the keys.

252
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,600
Keys!

253
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,200
oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?

254
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,400
I hope that wasn't British consul.

255
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Your majesty!
- Wait.

256
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,000
My wife was taken just this morning.
- Daddy!

257
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
I beg you, take me with you.

258
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,100
I want to come.
- No, Gael. Stay with your aunt.

259
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,300
I am a fight sailor, been on the seas
my whole life.

260
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,000
Of course, you must.
- Thank you.

261
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,800
But Daddy!
- If I ever not come back...

262
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,600
Now be good.

263
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,700
My king!

264
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,600
This was given to me by your father.
I hid it safely in the cave.

265
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,800
All these years.
- I thought that is Narnian sword?

266
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,500
It's from your Golden Age.
There are seven of those swords.

267
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,200
Gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.

268
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,700
Your father entrusted them to us.

269
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,300
Here. Take it.

270
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,900
And it may protect you.

271
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,100
Thank you, my Lord.
And we shall find your lost sisters(?).

272
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,100
Edmund.

273
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,000
Dear diary.
There has been extraordinary turn of event.

274
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,900
I have been abducted by my cousins and set
to drift in uncharted waters.

275
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,200
In some ridiculously looking boat.

276
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,800
What's worse, as I share quarters with obnoxious
mouse thing,

277
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,600
My thought banking with my cousins was bad enough.

278
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,300
So far, every person I met in this strange place
suffers

279
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,500
from the most florit delusions

280
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,700
Chasing for green mists and looking for lost lords.

281
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,200
I can only assume this is the result of poor diet.

282
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,100
Everyone are barking mad.

283
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,900
Cousin Edmund is no exception.

284
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,500
He spends every spare second rubbing that thin sword.

285
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,600
Like it's some magic lantern.
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.

286
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,000
It is going to be magnificient.
Do they come in a smaller size?

287
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,800
Peeving Marmud (?)
He's more delusional than my cousin.

288
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,100
In England we have mousetraps
and that sort of things.

289
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,800
Speaking of food, do you think I can get any
do you?

290
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,100
Uh, why you talking to that bird?

291
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,700
I just naturally assumed that...
- (Laughs) He's talking to birds.

292
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
He is as mad as a looner that one.

293
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,100
Shoo! Go go.

294
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,300
Are you aware sir...
Stealing rations is a capital offense?

295
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,200
Up here.

296
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,500
You.
- Men have been killed for less.

297
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,100
For What?
- Treason and sneakiness...and general nuisances.

298
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
Just hand over the orange and we'll let the matter pass.

299
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,200
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Allow me to...

300
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,300
I've had quite enough of you.
- Unhand the tail.

301
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,000
The Great Aslan himself gave me this tail.

302
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,500
No one. Repeat. No one touches the tail.

303
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,200
Period. Exclamation mark!
- Sorry.

304
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,800
Now. I will have the orange, then I will have satisfaction.

305
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,500
Puh, puh, please, please, please, um. I'm a pacifist.

306
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,600
Watch it.
- Sorry.

307
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
Are you trying to run away?
We're on a boat you know.

308
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Can't we just discuss this?

309
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,300
That is for stealing, that is for lying,
and that was for good measure.

310
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,400
(Laughs) That's the spirit! We have ourselves
a duel! Catch.

311
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,100
Now, come on.
Take your best shot.

312
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,900
Is that it?
Come on, boy.

313
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,000
Stop flapping your wings like
a drunken pelican.

314
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,100
Hoist!
Keep your leg up.

315
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,100
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

316
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,200
On your foot.
On your left, your right.

317
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,700
Got it? Come on.
The Nimble. It is a dance, boy.

318
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,000
Come on now. And again.

319
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, no.

320
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,800
And that!

321
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,900
Look.

322
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Gael, what are you doing here?

323
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,700
It seems that we
have an extra crew member.

324
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,400
Welcome aboard.
- Your majesty.

325
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Call me Lucy.
Come on.

326
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
Come on, look lovely, back to work!

327
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,300
Good match!
I will make a swordsman of you yet.

328
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Yes, well...it's the plane we look more even

329
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,700
it would be an entirely different result.

330
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,600
(Laughs) Indeed.

331
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
It looks like uninhabited.

332
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,000
If the Lords follow the mist to the east,
they would have stopped here.

333
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,700
It could be a trap.

334
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,600
Or it can held some answers.
- Caspian?

335
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,500
We spend the night on shore.
Scout the island everyone.

336
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,400
Ay, Your Majesty.

337
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,400
Seems they have brought a pig.

338
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
This one. It's female.

339
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
So is this one.

340
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,700
This one reads.

341
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,800
Let's take her.

342
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,400
There is no escape!
- We are scary.

343
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,800
What are you?
- We are terrifying invisible beasts.

344
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,900
If you could see us, you would be really
intimidated.

345
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,600
You forgot to mention that we all are
very large.

346
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,800
What do you want?
- You'll do what we ask.

347
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,000
She will!
- Very clear. Well put!

348
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,200
Or what?
- Or death.

349
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,300
Death.

350
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,000
Well, I won't be much use to you when
I'm dead now, would I?

351
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,600
I haven't thought of that.
- No, you hadn't. Fair point.

352
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Alright. Then we'll just kill your friends!

353
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Good idea.
- What do you want with me?

354
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,400
You'll enter the house of the Opressor.

355
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,000
What house?
- This one.

356
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,900
Upstairs, you'll find the book of incantation

357
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,200
recite the spell that makes the unseen, seen.

358
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Well put chief, well put.
- Very. Yeah.

359
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,800
Well, go on.
We haven't got all day.

360
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,900
Remember what will happen to your friends

361
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,000
You've been warned.
- Yeah.

362
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,900
Right.

363
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Why don't you do it yourself?
- We can't read.

364
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,800
Can't write for the matter of fact.

365
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,000
All that.
- Yeah.

366
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,100
Why didn't you just say so?

367
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,400
Beware of the opressor.
- He is very aggressive!

368
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:31,700
What makes the unseen, seen.
Got it? Don't forget that!

369
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,600
Ed, wake up.

370
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,500
Wake up!
Look.

371
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,900
Where's Lucy?
Lucy!

372
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,100
Everybody up!
- Get up.

373
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,700
This way.
- Move!

374
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,500
The Book of Incantation

375
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,900
MAXIM TO HEAL Pain

376
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,100
A MAXIM TO FORGET

377
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,100
With these words, Your tongue must sew.
For all around there to be snow.

378
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:10,000
An infallible spell to make you she,
the beauty you've always wanted to be.

379
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,800
Susan, what's going on?

380
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm beautiful.

381
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
No! wait.

382
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
Make me she, whom i'd agree.

383
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Aslan?

384
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,200
A spell to make the unseen, seen.

385
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,700
If the 'p' in psychology,
the 'h' in psychiatry...

386
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,700
invisible ink and the truth
in theology.

387
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
Caspian, Lucy's dagger.

388
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,400
Stop right there or there is!

389
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,800
The spell is complete.

390
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,300
Now all is visible.

391
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,300
What sort of creatures are you?
- Great ones.

392
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,100
With the head of a tiger and
the body of um-different tiger.

393
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,000
You don't want to mess with us!
- Or what?

394
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,400
Or I'll claw you to death!

395
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,100
I'll run my touch right through you!

396
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,900
I will crush you with my teeth.
- And i'll bite you with my fangs.

397
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,500
You mean squash us
with your fat bellies?

398
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,800
Fatty bellies?
- Or tickle us with your toes?

399
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,000
What have you done with my sister, you little pip squid?

400
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Now, calm down.
- Where is she?

401
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,800
Can I tell him?
- Tell him, chief.

402
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,600
In the mansion.
- What mansion?

403
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Oh. That mansion.

404
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Now, I'm getting tired of you leaving me behind.

405
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,200
The thing came back.

406
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,700
This place is weirder and weirder.

407
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,300
He's calling us weird.

408
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:26,700
- Lucy! Your majesty.
- Caspian and Edmund.

409
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,300
This is Coriakin.
It's his island.

410
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,600
That's what he thinks.
You have wronged us, magician.

411
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,400
I have not wronged you, I've made you
invisible for your own protection.

412
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Protection?
- That's aggressive! Opressor!

413
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,800
I have not opressed you.
- But you could have!

414
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,900
If you wanted to!
- Be gone.

415
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,800
What was that?
- Loot(?). But don't tell them.

416
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,800
What were those things?
- Dufflepuds.

417
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,300
Of course.
Silly me.

418
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,900
What did you mean when you said you made them
invisible for their own good?

419
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
It seems to be the easiest way
to protect them.

420
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,300
From the evil.
- You mean the mist?

421
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,900
I mean what lies behind the mist.

422
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,000
It's quite beautiful.

423
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean for a made belived that and
a made believed world.

424
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,000
There is the source of your problems.

425
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,400
The Dark Island.
A place where evil lurks.

426
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,400
It can take any form. It can make your
darkest dream come true.

427
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,400
It seeks to corrupt all goodness

428
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,800
Steal the lights from this world.

429
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,800
How do we stop it?
- You must break its spell.

430
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,700
That sword you carry, there
are six others.

431
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,900
Have you seen them?
- Yes.

432
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,900
The six lords, they passed through here?
- Indeed.

433
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,600
Where are they heading?
- Where I've sent them.

434
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,100
Break the spell.
You must follow the Blue Star...

435
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
to Ramandu's Island.

436
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,100
There the seven swords must be laid
at Aslan's table.

437
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,300
Only then can the truly magical power
be released.

438
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,500
But beware. You will
all about to be tested.

439
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Tested?

440
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,700
It will do everything in it's power
to tempt you.

441
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,900
Be strong...

442
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,800
Don't fall to temptations.

443
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,500
To defeat the darkness out there

444
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,300
you must defeat the darkness inside yourself.

445
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,400
For reasons beyond my comprehension

446
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,000
We have taken the advice from the senile old coup(?).

447
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,500
who doesn't possess a razor, and
walks around on a dressing gown.

448
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,700
So we're back in the bathtub and
and lost in the tempest. Brilliant!

449
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,500
14 days of being tossed like a pancake,
not the slightest sight of land.

450
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,100
The only consolation is that everyone is finally
as miserable as I am.

451
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,300
Except for that show-off talking rat.

452
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,500
He is one of the annoying glass is always
half full part.

453
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,900
So, we're stuck here...

454
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,100
with half rations, we have
food and water for two more weeks maximum.

455
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:58,500
This is your last chance to
turn back, your majesty.

456
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,900
Not in this storm.

457
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,200
Needle in a haystack trying to find this
remoteless place.

458
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,100
We can sail way past and knocked to the end
of world.

459
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,300
We can be eaten by a sea serpent.

460
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,000
You'll see when the men are getting nervous.

461
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,500
These are strange seas we are sailing

462
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,400
the lights that which i've never seen before.

463
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,000
Then perhaps captain, you'd love to be the one
to explain to Mr. Rince that we're abandoning

464
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,600
the search for his families?

465
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,100
I'll get back to it.

466
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,400
Just a word of warning,

467
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,800
the seas can play nasty tricks on a crew mind.

468
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,600
Very nasty.

469
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,900
Transform my reflection, cast into affection

470
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,200
lashes, lips and complexion.

471
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,600
Let me like whom I agree,
cause more beauty over me.

472
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,700
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ms. Pevensie.

473
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,800
Edmund?
- You look beautiful, Sister.

474
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,200
As always.
- Peter!

475
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,300
Excuse me Miss,
Can I get a photo?

476
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,100
Mother's gonne love this,
all her children in one picture.

477
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,900
Smile!
- Hang on. Where am I?

478
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,600
I mean where's Lucy?
- Lucy, who's Lucy?

479
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,100
Susan, what's wrong?

480
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,800
Come on now Miss.
A nice big smile!

481
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,600
Edmund, I'm not sure about this. I think
I want to go back.

482
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,800
Go back where?
- To Narnia!

483
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,800
What is Narnia?
- What's going on?

484
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,100
Stop this!

485
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,500
Lucy.
- Aslan?

486
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,300
What have you done, child?

487
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,400
I don't know,
but that was awful.

488
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
But you chose it, Lucy.

489
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,500
I didn't mean to choose all that. I just wanted
to be as beautiful like Susan.

490
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,100
That's all.

491
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,300
You wished yourself away,
and with it, much more.

492
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,100
Your brothers and sisters wouldn't know Narnia
without you, Lucy.

493
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,900
You discovered it first, remember?

494
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,900
I'm so sorry.

495
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:09,200
You doubt your value,
don't run from who you are.

496
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,600
Aslan!

497
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,600
Father.

498
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,700
Edmund.

499
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,400
Come with me.
Join me.

500
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,200
Edmund?

501
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,800
Lucy.

502
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,500
I can't sleep.
- Let me guess. Bad dream?

503
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:40,400
So either we're all going mad,
or something is playing with our minds.

504
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,700
I doubt the Lord stopped here,
there is no sign of anything living.

505
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,000
Right. Well, once you have got on shore, take your men
for food and water.

506
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,900
The three of us will look for clues.
- You mean the four of us?

507
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,100
Come on, please don't send me back to the rat.
- I heard that!

508
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,700
Big ears.
- I heard that too.

509
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,200
Look. We
not the first on the island.

510
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,500
The Lords?
- Could be.

511
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,900
What do you think could be down there?

512
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,200
Let's find out.

513
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,900
What is that?
- I don't know. Looks like some kind of a gold statue.

514
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,000
He must have fallen in.

515
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,000
Poor man.
- You mean, poor Lord.

516
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,600
The crust of Lord rest in him.
- And his sword.

517
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,100
We need it.

518
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,500
Be careful.

519
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,900
Your sword hasn't turn to gold.
- Both swords are magical.

520
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,300
He mustn't have known what hit him.

521
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,700
Maybe, or maybe
He was onto something.

522
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,200
What are you talking about?

523
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,500
What are you staring at?

524
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:11,300
Whoever has access to this pool,
could be the most powerful person in the world.

525
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,300
Lucy, we'll be so rich

526
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,500
no one can tell us what to do, or who to
live with.

527
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,400
You can't take anything out of Narnia, Edmund.

528
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,700
Says who?
- I do.

529
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,900
I am not your subject.

530
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,400
You have been waiting for this, haven't you?
To challenge me. You doubt my leadership!

531
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,500
You doubt yourself.

532
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,200
You're a child.
- And you're a spineless sap.

533
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,700
Edmund?
- I'm tired of playing second fiddle...

534
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,200
First it was Peter, and now it's you.

535
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,400
You know I am braver than both of you.

536
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,400
Why did you Peter's sword?
I deserve a kingdom of my own!

537
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,000
I deserve to rule!
- If you think you're so brave...

538
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,400
prove it!

539
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,600
No!
Stop it!

540
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,900
Both of you.
Look at yourself.

541
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,600
Can't you see what's happenning?

542
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,800
This place has tempted you.

543
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,600
It is bewitching you,
This is exactly what Coriakin is talking about.

544
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,100
Let's just get outta here.

545
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:52,000
Oh yes, follow the imaginary blue star,
to the island of Rabandoedoe...

546
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,800
Like the seven steak knives
on the table of a talking lion.

547
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,200
Nonsense.

548
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,500
What is that?

549
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,000
I must be dead.

550
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,800
You are definitely dead.

551
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,400
You wouldn't be needing that one wont you.

552
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,100
Finally, a favorable turn
of events.

553
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,100
What foods did you found?

554
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,100
It is volcanic, My majesty.
Nothing grows.

555
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,100
Where is Eustace?

556
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,200
I believe he's out not helping us loading
the boats.

557
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,200
Eustace!

558
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,900
I have got a bad feeling.

559
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,700
I'm going to find him.

560
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,600
I'll come with you.

561
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,400
Eustace?

562
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,900
Treasure.

563
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,000
Trouble.

564
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Eustace's.

565
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,500
No.

566
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm sorry.
- He was just a boy.

567
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,900
I shouldn't have left him.

568
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,000
What could have happened to him?

569
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,500
In this place? Anything.

570
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,500
And he wasn't the first.

571
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,100
It's Lord Octesian.

572
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:14,200
We should find this... sword.

573
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,100
What was that?

574
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,500
Is it the volcano?

575
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,900
Oh no, that's not a volcano.
All hands on deck.

576
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,400
Archers, arm yourselves!

577
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,500
Take your positions
and wait for my command.

578
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,000
What is it doing?
- Fire!

579
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,400
He will break the mast.

580
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Hold your positions.

581
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,600
Fire!

582
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,800
Edmund!

583
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,300
Edmund!
- Lucy.

584
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,400
I AM Eustace

585
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,800
You've got to be joking!

586
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,900
He must have been tempted by the treasure.

587
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,400
Everyone knows that the dragon's treasure
is enchanted.

588
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,600
Apart anyone from here.

589
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,800
Is there any way to change him back?
- Not that I know of.

590
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,900
Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.

591
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,500
Sorry about the hand, oh boy.
I can be a little over zealous sometimes.

592
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,100
The boats are ready, sire.
- We can not leave him.

593
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,800
Well, we can't bring him on board, Your Majesty.

594
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,600
You and others take one boat back.
The rest of us stay here until morning.

595
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,500
and work out what to do.
- But you have no provisions.

596
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,200
And no means of staying warm, My Majesty

597
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,000
And you were saying?

598
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,700
I've never seen these constellation before.

599
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,700
Me neither.

600
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,800
We are long way from home.

601
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,300
When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing
to the end of the world.

602
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,900
To find my father there.

603
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,300
Maybe you are.

604
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:43,000
I miss my mommy.

605
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,900
I miss mine too.

606
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,600
Don't worry, you'll see her again.

607
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,800
How do you know?
- You just have to have faith about these things.

608
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,200
Aslan will help us.

609
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,600
But Aslan could have stop her from being taken.

610
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,500
We'll find her, I promise.

611
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,900
Somehow.

612
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,800
Trouble sleeping?

613
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:46,300
Now now, all is not lost as it seems.

614
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,400
I'll stay up with you if you wish.
To keep you company.

615
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,700
You didn't even believe in dragons this morning.

616
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,900
You know, extraordinary things
only happen to extraordinary people.

617
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,300
Maybe it's a sign!

618
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,500
That you've got an extraordinary destiny

619
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,900
Something greater than you could have imagine.

620
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:23,000
I can tell you one or two of my adventures
if you like, just past the time.

621
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,900
Believe it or not, you are not the
first dragon I've encountered.

622
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,300
Many years ago,
too many that I care to imagine.

623
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,800
I was with a band of pirates
and I met another dragon.

624
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,100
Much fierce than you.

625
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,600
Lucy, wake up.

626
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,700
Look.

627
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,600
The Blue Star.

628
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,400
Everybody up.
- What?

629
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,100
It is the blue star.
- Wake up.

630
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,800
Pull.

631
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:43,200
Put your strokes in there, lads!
Pull!

632
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,400
The wind has left.

633
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,700
So how do we get to Ramandu Island now then?

634
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,000
My guess is something doesn't want us to get there.

635
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,300
Pull.

636
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,600
If I'm getting hungrier,
I'm gonna eat that dragon!

637
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,600
Don't worry, Eustace, they will
to deal with me first.

638
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,900
If we don't get to landfall by tonight,
they might as well eat them...

639
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,800
What are we hitting?

640
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,800
Eustace, that's brilliant!

641
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,700
En route!

642
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:58,000
We can't be sure that the other Lords even
made it to Ramandu's Island.

643
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:14,900
You got us there! What did I tell you?
Eustace, you're extraordinary!

644
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,200
Wait.

645
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,100
Lord Revilian.

646
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,800
Lord Mavramorn.

647
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,000
Lord Argoz.

648
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,800
He's breathing!

649
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,200
So are they.

650
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,900
They're under the spell.

651
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,600
It's the food!

652
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,500
Hey, it's the stone knife.
This is Aslan's table!

653
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,900
The swords.

654
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,100
Let me take it.

655
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,400
That's six.

656
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,200
We're missing one.

657
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Look!

658
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,600
Travellers of Narnia

659
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,500
Welcome.

660
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,100
Arise!

661
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,200
Do you look hungry?
- Who are you?

662
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,800
I am Lilliandil.

663
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,100
Daughter of Ramandu.

664
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,400
I am your guide.

665
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,400
You're a star.

666
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,300
You're most beautiful.

667
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:02,900
If it is a distraction for you, I can
change forms.
- No.

668
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,600
Please.

669
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,100
The food is for you.

670
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,800
There is enough for everyone
that welcome to Aslan's table.

671
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Always. Help yourselves.

672
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,900
Wait.

673
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,100
What happened to them?

674
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,800
These poor men were half mad
by the time they reached our shores.

675
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,500
They threatened each other with violence.
Violence is forbidden at the table of Aslan.

676
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,500
So they were sent to sleep.
- Will they ever awake?

677
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,000
When all is put right.

678
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,100
Come. There is little time.

679
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,300
The Magician Coriakin told you
of Dark Island?

680
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,100
Yes.

681
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,000
For long the evil will be unstoppable.

682
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Coriakin said, to break the spell,
we need the seventh sword on the Aslan's table.

683
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,800
He speaks the truth.
- But we found only six.

684
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Do you know where the seventh is?

685
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,400
In there.

686
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,900
You will need great courage.

687
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,500
Now, don't waste your time.

688
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,700
How we meet again?

689
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,800
Goodbye.

690
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,300
So what do you think it's in there?

691
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,400
Our worst nightmares.

692
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,300
Our darkest wishes.

693
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,000
Pure evil.

694
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,200
Tavros, unlock the armory

695
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,000
Archers, prepare yourselves.

696
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,300
Dock the lanterns.

697
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,500
Let's get ready.

698
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,400
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

699
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,400
When you grow up,

700
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,400
you should be just like you.

701
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,500
If case we don't get through,

702
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,000
whatever this is...

703
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,300
I want you to know I think of you as my brother.

704
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,500
Me too.

705
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,500
You gave up your sword.

706
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,400
It was not mine to keep.

707
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,000
Use this.

708
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,500
But it is...
- Peter would like you to have it.

709
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:43,000
Here it is, my friend.
The battle awaits.

710
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,200
Eustace, no. Wait.

711
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,000
Stop.

712
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,400
I will not accept surrender.
A true warrior does not flight out of fear.

713
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,200
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

714
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,800
I'm a mouse.
You a dragon.

715
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,900
You have a skin of leather.
You breathe fire.

716
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,400
Come on, let's meet our destiny.

717
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,600
No matter what happens here.

718
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:26,300
every soul standing before me, has earned a
place on the Dawn Treader.

719
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,500
Together we traveled far.

720
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,900
Together, we have faced diversity.
Together...

721
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,900
we can do it again.

722
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:39,600
So now is not the time to fall in fears and
temptations. Be strong!

723
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,300
Never give in.

724
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:46,400
Our world, our Narnian lives
depend on it.

725
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,000
Think of the lost souls
we are here to save.

726
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,000
Think of Aslan.

727
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:00,500
Think of Narnia.
- For Narnia!

728
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,200
For Narnia!

729
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,300
Helene?

730
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,200
We can't see a thing.

731
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,900
The fog is too thick.

732
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,400
You're a great disappointment
to me.

733
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,500
You call yourself my son?

734
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,300
And act like a king.

735
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,100
Edmund.

736
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,800
Come with me.

737
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,700
Be my king.

738
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,900
I let you rule.
- Go away.

739
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,700
You're dead.
- You can never kill me.

740
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,500
I will always be alive
in your mind, silly boy.

741
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,900
No!
- Edmund?

742
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,500
Are you alright?

743
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,300
Keep away!

744
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,700
Keep away!
- Who's there?

745
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:20,600
Will we not fear you!
- Not, are you?

746
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,200
Keep away!
- We do not leave.

747
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,900
You will not defeat me.

748
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,900
Caspian, the sword!

749
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,400
Lord Rhoop.

750
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,600
You cannot own me!
- Stand down.

751
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,300
Let's get him onboard, quickly!

752
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:02,900
Be calm my Lord.
- Off me, demons!

753
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,700
We're not here to hurt you.
I am your king.

754
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,600
Caspian.

755
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,800
My Lord.

756
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,900
You should not have come.
There is no way out of here.

757
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:23,000
Quickly turn this ship about
before it is too late.

758
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,800
We have the sword.
Let's go!

759
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,700
Let's turn this ship around.

760
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,800
Do not think.

761
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,300
Do not let it know your fears,
or it will become them!

762
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,200
Oh no.
- Edmund.

763
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,800
What did you just think of?
- I'm sorry.

764
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,200
What is that?

765
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,800
It's too late!

766
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,900
Get on the boat

767
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,700
Come, walk.

768
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,100
Don't let me down.
No fear. No retreats.

769
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,600
For Narnia! Take that.

770
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,700
And that.

771
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,900
Eustace, hang on!

772
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,700
I'll kill it.
- No, the sword!

773
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Eustace!

774
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,000
Come back.
- We are doomed. Doomed!

775
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,800
Turn this ship about.
- Stop him.

776
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,300
Rowers.
To your rowing position.

777
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,100
Forward at double speed.
- Aslan, please help us.

778
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,700
Pull.

779
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,100
Pull!

780
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,700
Where are you?

781
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,700
You must stay here until someone comes and
get you!

782
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,800
Ed! We run the serpent, smash him on the rocks.

783
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Stay on the port, I will keep it on the ground.

784
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,500
Look out!

785
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,400
Pull!

786
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Try to kill me, come on!
Come on here.

787
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,600
No!
- Edmund.

788
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:30,400
I'm still here.

789
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,600
Brace yourselves!

790
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:50,900
Move!

791
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,500
We can beat this.

792
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,900
We must get closer.
- Everybody to the main deck.

793
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,200
Get ready.

794
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,800
I want everyone here.

795
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,500
Ready...

796
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,100
now!

797
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,100
Put his head down!

798
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,200
Heave!

799
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:30,000
What are you trying to prove, Edmund?

800
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
That you are a man?

801
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,500
Do it!

802
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,700
I can make you that.
I can make you my king.

803
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,700
Just take my hand.

804
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,300
Just give it here.

805
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,800
Do it!

806
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,900
Come on!

807
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,500
No!

808
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:59,300
The spell, it has lifted.

809
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:09,500
Edmund, Caspian, Look!

810
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:38,500
Narnians!

811
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:56,200
Mommy!
- Helene.

812
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,600
Mommy.

813
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,900
Let's have them onboard, clear the decks.

814
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,000
We did it, i knew we would.

815
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,500
It wasn't just us.
- You mean?

816
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,300
I'm here, Lucy.

817
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:39,000
Here, Lucy.
I'm in the water.

818
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I am a boy again.
A boy!

819
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:46,400
Eustace! I see your wings have been clipped.

820
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:54,400
Where sky and water meet.
Where the waves grow ever sweet.

821
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,100
It's sweet!

822
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,900
Look.

823
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:10,000
Aslan's country.

824
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,800
We must have be close.

825
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,400
Well, we've come so far.

826
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:29,700
So what was it like?
When Aslan changed you back?

827
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:35,000
No matter how hard i tried,
I just couldn't do it myself.

828
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:38,000
Then he came towards me.
It was sort of hurt, but...

829
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,700
It was good pay.

830
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:44,300
Like when you pull a sword from your foot.

831
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,200
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.

832
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,400
I mean I was a better dragon
than a boy, really.

833
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,200
I'm so sorry for being such a sob(?).

834
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,800
It's okay Eustace.
You were a pretty good dragon.

835
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,500
My friends, we've arrived

836
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,800
Aslan.

837
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,500
Welcome, children.
You have done well.

838
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:49,000
Very well indeed.
You have come far.

839
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,200
Now your journey is at it's end.

840
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:56,200
Is this your country?
- No, my country lies beyond.

841
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:03,500
Is my father in your country?
- You can only find that out on yourself, my son.

842
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,100
But you should know that if you continue,
there is no return.

843
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,000
You not going?

844
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:46,400
Can't imagine my father would be very proud that I
gave up what he died for.

845
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,900
I spent too long wanting what have been taken from me
but not what was given.

846
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,700
I was given a kingdom.

847
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:59,300
People.

848
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:07,900
I promise to be a better king.
- You already are.

849
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,100
Children.

850
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,700
I think perhaps it's time we went home actually then?

851
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,700
I thought you loved it here?
- I do!

852
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,400
But I love home
and our family as well!

853
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,700
They need us.

854
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:40,700
Your eminence, ever since i can remember, I've
dreamt of seeing your country

855
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,900
I have had many great adventures in this world,
but nothing has dampen that yearning.

856
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:50,700
I know I'm hardly worthy,
but with your permission...

857
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:54,600
I'd lay down my sword for the joy of seeing
your country.

858
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,000
With my own eyes.

859
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:04,800
My country was made for noble hearts such as yours.

860
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,100
No matter how small that can be.

861
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:11,100
Your majesty.
- Nobody deserves it more.

862
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,200
It's true.

863
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:32,200
May I?
- Well, I suppose...just this..

864
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,900
Goodbye, Lucy.

865
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,600
Don't cry.

866
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,100
I don't understand.

867
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:02,200
When will I see you again?

868
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,500
What a magnificent puzzle you are.

869
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,400
And a true hero.

870
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,600
It has been my honor to fight beside such
a brave warrior.

871
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,700
And a great friend.

872
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,500
I won't be needing this.

873
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,200
This is our last time here, isn't it?
- Yes.

874
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,300
You have grown up, my dear one.

875
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,200
Just like Peter and Susan.
- Will you visit us in our world?

876
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,500
I shall be watching you always.

877
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,700
How?
- In your world...

878
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:16,000
I have another name.
You must learn to know me by it.

879
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:20,200
That was the very reason you were brought
to Narnia.

880
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:25,100
That by knowing me here for a little,
You'll know me better there.

881
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,900
Will we meet again?

882
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:32,000
Yes, dear one. One day.

883
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,900
You are closest to me I have as family.

884
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,500
And that includes you, Eustace.

885
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,800
Thank you.

886
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,200
Will I come back?

887
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:27,400
Narnia may yet of need of you.

888
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:29,100
Eustace! What are you doing up there?

889
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,000
Jill drops in for a visit.

890
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:46,400
We spoke often of Narnia in the days that follow.

891
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,200
And when all my cousins have left.

892
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,100
After the war ended...

893
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:57,100
I missed them with all my heart.

894
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,500
As I know all Narnians will miss them

895
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:04,100
Till the end of time.
