1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:03,289
[water splashing]

2
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:10,379
[frenzied drum music]

3
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:12,059
[women yelling]

4
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:17,126
- [Silvia] Keep going, keep going.

5
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,428
Go.

6
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:29,873
- [Dallas] Go, go.

7
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,061
- Is he following us?

8
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:35,894
- I don't know, I don't know.

9
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,878
Keep going, keep going.

10
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:43,528
[creature roaring]

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,714
[calm music]

12
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:57,408
- Gorgeous, just gorgeous.

13
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,188
You really have a beautiful place here.

14
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:00,021
- Thank you.

15
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:02,858
- Yeah, it's like it jumped
off the page of a script.

16
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,758
- Nah, it's been here for years.

17
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:06,921
- I know that.

18
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:09,548
I just meant how perfect it is.

19
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:11,838
- And I was just making a joke.

20
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,998
- And I knew that.

21
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,838
- Okay, so here's the plan.

22
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,138
We're looking at coming back
in maybe about four months

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,298
to do the actual shooting.

24
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:22,131
Four months or so.

25
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,658
We don't have an exact
schedule laid down just yet.

26
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,008
- I don't see a problem with any of that,

27
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,448
but I would like some more details

28
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:30,028
about what exactly is
going to happen here.

29
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,345
How many people and such.

30
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,378
- We're gonna have a ton
of extras those days.

31
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:36,698
- [Jim] Who cleans up after them?

32
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:37,531
- Oh, we do.

33
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,468
Oh, we totally do.

34
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,258
It's our policy to leave every location

35
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,768
just as good if not better
than when we got here.

36
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,103
- Absolutely.
- Promise.

37
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,339
- And if someone or something
gets hurt or damaged?

38
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,638
- We have a $2 million insurance policy,

39
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:51,418
so if anything were to
happen, we'll take care of it.

40
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:55,268
- So, what is the name
of this movie again?

41
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:58,508
- It's called "Anubis, God of the Dead."

42
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:00,318
- That sounds scary.

43
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:03,198
I don't like horror films.

44
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,048
- Oh, well, you know what?

45
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:06,328
I didn't like horror films
either for a long time,

46
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:08,088
but then I started to make them.

47
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:08,921
Now, I think they're great.

48
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:11,058
They're so much fun to make.

49
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:11,891
- You know what?

50
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,328
We should get you two to
be extras on those days.

51
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:15,468
- Yes, we should.

52
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,118
We'll get our makeup artist
to make you up like zombies

53
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:19,758
and we'll make sure you're in the shots.

54
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,358
- Sounds like fun.

55
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:24,618
- Thank you so much for
letting us film here.

56
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,588
- Oh, you're welcome.

57
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,938
It's so exciting.

58
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:29,288
- Besides, you're paying us.

59
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,918
- So we're good?

60
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,481
Do either of you like horror films?

61
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:33,314
- No.

62
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,147
- I do.

63
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:34,980
I like the old ones.

64
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,088
"Night of the Living Dead,"
"Psycho," "The Birds."

65
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,248
- Oh, so do I.

66
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:40,088
Do you like action films?

67
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:41,284
- [Jim] Oh yeah.

68
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,501
- Then you're gonna love
the scene we film here.

69
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,958
It's part of the climax of the film.

70
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:48,288
Our heroes are in a
helicopter and they crash land

71
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,828
in the field and then
there's an army of zombies

72
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,898
coming out and they attack them

73
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,598
and then there's explosions
and the machine gun fire.

74
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,618
It's gonna be great.

75
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:59,491
- And if one of my cows
is scared to death?

76
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:00,470
- What?

77
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:01,303
[nervous laughing]

78
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,778
- The cows won't be anywhere
near the explosions.

79
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:04,611
- I understand that.

80
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:07,078
A friend of mine up in PA has a farm.

81
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,758
Some filmmakers couple farms over

82
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:11,798
put off an explosion that
killed one of his cows.

83
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,324
They had to pay for it.

84
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,338
[Silvia laughing]

85
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:16,018
- I've never heard anything like that.

86
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:16,851
- Take care of...

87
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,458
- But if anything were
to happen like that,

88
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,291
we'll take care of it.

89
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,295
- Good to hear.

90
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,338
- Good job finding this place.

91
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,228
- Thanks.

92
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:27,728
Sometimes getting lost pays off.

93
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,268
- Yeah.

94
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:32,908
The only problem I see is
that the cell reception sucks.

95
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:34,098
- I know.

96
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:35,398
I don't even have a bar.

97
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,418
How big of a problem will that be?

98
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,638
- It's just an inconvenience.

99
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:41,618
I mean, they've got a landline.

100
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:42,685
We'll just use that.

101
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,588
So how long have you been scouting?

102
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,108
- Um, maybe two years?

103
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:56,175
This is my sixth project,
but second feature.

104
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,038
- Well, you do great work.

105
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,118
We'll be happy to work with
you again, if you like.

106
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:02,558
- I'd love to, yeah.

107
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,638
- What about this production?

108
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:05,628
I might be able to get you another spot.

109
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:06,678
- That sounds great.

110
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,848
- Okay, I'll talk to Dallas.

111
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,988
Hey.
- Hey.

112
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,498
What a fabulous location, huh?

113
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:12,798
- We were just talking about that.

114
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:15,018
- Yeah, it's really going to
allow Dallas to do so much.

115
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,668
I mean, we can shoot in any direction

116
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:18,520
and there's nothing to mark the shot.

117
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,698
Doesn't get any better than that.

118
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,178
- Have you two worked together before?

119
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,588
- Us? Yeah, many times.

120
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:24,658
- [Lois] Yeah.

121
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,158
- This is my fourth time with Dallas.

122
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,678
- Dallas likes to work with
the same people over and over.

123
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:30,398
We're like family now.

124
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,368
- And have a lot of fun.

125
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:33,532
Hard work, but fun.

126
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:36,553
Look at it.

127
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:39,115
What a beautiful magic hour.

128
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,135
- Why do they call it the magic hour?

129
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,728
- Well on camera,
everything looks beautiful.

130
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:49,148
Setting sun, painted
sky with popping colors.

131
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:51,131
Of course, that was before

132
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:53,758
digital color correction came out.

133
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:54,591
Hey, Dallas.

134
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:55,628
Check out this magic hour.

135
00:04:58,305 --> 00:04:59,138
- Oh, beautiful.

136
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,958
- Well, I hate to cut this short, but...

137
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,068
- Really wanna thank you
guys for taking the time

138
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:07,098
to show us your farm and uh...

139
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:08,490
- [Dallas] Yes, thank you.

140
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,394
I'm looking forward to shooting here.

141
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,988
- Not a problem, not a problem.

142
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:12,518
- Is everything all right?

143
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:14,468
- You're welcome to
take your time leaving,

144
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:16,968
but we need to be in the house by sundown.

145
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:18,478
- Is this for religious reasons?

146
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:19,378
- Hell no.

147
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,693
[tense music]

148
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,565
- Look, I don't understand all this.

149
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,428
- We close the doors at sundown

150
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,698
and we don't open them
again until sunrise.

151
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:37,978
- Is everything okay?

152
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,438
- [Jim] It's fine.

153
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,048
- Should we be concerned?

154
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:45,058
- I'd head out now if I were you.

155
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:45,918
- What's going on?

156
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:46,891
I don't understand.

157
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:47,908
- It's all right.
- Calm down.

158
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:50,058
- We just need to be in the house.

159
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,908
- Listen, if we need to
pick a different location

160
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:52,741
or something, we can.

161
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:54,438
I mean, if there's a
problem here, then we will-

162
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:55,808
- No, no problem.

163
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,288
Money you're talking's good money.

164
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,248
We want you to make your movie here.

165
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,878
- Then tell us what is going on.

166
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:06,578
- Well, you're gonna think I'm crazy.

167
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:08,777
Frankly. I don't give a shit.

168
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:09,610
- [Dallas] Okay.

169
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:10,768
- But for the past month something's

170
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:11,898
been coming outta the woods

171
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,318
and circling our house
all night, every night.

172
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:15,738
- Well, what is it?

173
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:18,698
- I don't know, but it's
big and it's strong.

174
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:20,368
Carried off one of my calves.

175
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,018
Picked it up right out of the pen.

176
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,168
- Jesus.

177
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:25,118
Does it leave tracks?

178
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,018
- All over the place.

179
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,648
There's one right here by
the corner of the porch.

180
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,015
It's about a week old,
so it's not that clear.

181
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:33,898
- Holy shit.

182
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:36,968
Wes, check this out.

183
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:38,358
- [Chuck] Guys.

184
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,518
- Are you kidding me? Is this real?

185
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,908
- Oh, it's real, all right.

186
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,058
Now I'd be gettin' a
move on if I was y'all

187
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,108
because you don't wanna be
here if it comes around.

188
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,708
It can get real mean.

189
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,148
- Okay, thanks for your
time, Mr. and Mrs. Owen.

190
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:51,928
We appreciate it. Guys?

191
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,668
- We'll get the contracts
in the mail to you.

192
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,208
- All right.

193
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:57,075
- Come on guys, let's roll out, huh?

194
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:58,820
- [Dallas] Come on.

195
00:06:58,887 --> 00:06:59,720
- Come on.

196
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:07,217
[upbeat retro music]

197
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,868
Terrific job, by the way.

198
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:11,701
It was a good day.

199
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,368
Everybody did great, especially Liz here.

200
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,937
Location Liz, everybody.

201
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,638
[everyone cheers]

202
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,258
- Thanks, guys.

203
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,248
- That footprint was crazy.

204
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,758
- Hey Dallas, check it out.

205
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,158
- Jesus, look at that.

206
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,908
- You guys don't really
think that's real, do you?

207
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:25,961
- Sure I do.

208
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,688
[everyone laughing]

209
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:29,521
- I don't know.

210
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,354
I can't imagine living somewhere

211
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:32,848
where some thing was coming out at night.

212
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:34,618
- Oh, I lived in a place like that once.

213
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:35,818
- Yeah, what'd you do?

214
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:37,996
- I kicked him out and
got a restraining order.

215
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:40,508
[everyone laughing]

216
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:41,528
- Do you think it's Bigfoot?

217
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,008
- No.
- What else could it be?

218
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,175
- Actually, I don't believe it is Bigfoot.

219
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,128
Bigfoot's not usually known in Tennessee.

220
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,945
Maybe in the Appalachians,
but not middle of Tennessee.

221
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,048
- How do you know that?

222
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:57,856
- I've always been into Bigfoot.

223
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,055
[everyone laughing]

224
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,055
- Of course you have.

225
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:00,888
Makes total sense.

226
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,298
- I've watched and read
everything about them.

227
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,818
- Well if it's not Bigfoot, what is it?

228
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,268
- I'm not sure.

229
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:12,098
There's some creature
in Southwest Arkansas

230
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:13,888
called the Fouke Monster.

231
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:17,418
It's like Bigfoot, but
it has a nasty side.

232
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:18,478
They made a movie about it.

233
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,769
It was called "The Legend of Boggy Creek."

234
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:21,602
- I remember that.

235
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,545
I remember when that came out.

236
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:23,809
That was scary as hell back in the day.

237
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:25,695
- I think Owens was just messing with you.

238
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:27,729
- I don't know, he looked really scared.

239
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:29,129
- I'm with you on that, Lois.

240
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:30,839
- Well, either way we don't have to worry

241
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:32,629
about it for another four months.

242
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,469
- Yeah.

243
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:34,369
- Good point.

244
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:39,079
Right, right.

245
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,769
I love the costumes
you picked out for Geb.

246
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:46,749
For Susan, I'd like to
see a few more samples.

247
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,716
So far, it's just not doing it for me.

248
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:50,919
Okay.

249
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:52,889
Yes.

250
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,409
Vicky, you rock it as usual.

251
00:08:58,346 --> 00:08:59,196
Talk to you soon.

252
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:02,089
How was New York?

253
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:05,299
- Oh, ask Madam Jackie Daniels.

254
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,529
- Stop shouting.

255
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,876
Besides, some of us can handle our liquor.

256
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:11,909
- Yes, that's that's true.

257
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:14,079
Hey, show everybody your new tattoo.

258
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:15,569
- Bite me.

259
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,269
The investors are very happy.

260
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:18,463
- With your tattoo?

261
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,589
[everyone laughing]

262
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:21,119
- Awesome.

263
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,499
- They approved the script, they loved it.

264
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,759
They said no changes whatsoever.

265
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:25,809
- No changes?

266
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:26,939
- [Silvia] Nope.

267
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,949
- Not even the lesbian
Nazi zombie in the bathtub?

268
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:30,867
- They're good to go.

269
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:31,818
- [Lois] No, no.

270
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:32,651
- Yes.

271
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:35,089
- Although I wouldn't hurt
my feelings if you cut it.

272
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:37,759
- We'll shoot it and see
how it plays out in the cut.

273
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:38,659
- Fair enough.

274
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,425
- Morning all, morning.

275
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:43,349
[everyone exclaims]

276
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,059
Dallas, guess what I watched last night?

277
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,006
- What?

278
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:47,049
- "Creature of the Black Lake."

279
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,519
- Oh, I love that movie.

280
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,919
It's one of the best
Bigfoot monster movies.

281
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,019
- Low budget, but a really great film.

282
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:55,789
- I am so glad you two are
still on your Bigfoot kick

283
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,389
because I've gotten the investors

284
00:09:57,456 --> 00:10:00,828
to pony up an extra
$20,000 just so you two

285
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,259
can shoot a little documentary
about your creature.

286
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,385
- What?
- Ooh, yes.

287
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:06,218
- [Chuck] You're gonna take a break

288
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:07,051
off from production here.

289
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,536
We'll go up and we'll
shoot some footage for you.

290
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:09,619
- [Wes] Are you serious?

291
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:10,949
- [Chuck] Yes, I'm serious.

292
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:11,782
- [Wes] Awesomeness.

293
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:12,615
- George is gonna take forever

294
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:13,679
to get this money laid down anyways.

295
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,699
We got at least two weeks.

296
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,259
So we go down there, we shoot
what we can and the investors

297
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,569
figure we can make a whole
documentary out of it

298
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:20,402
if it works.

299
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,229
And if it doesn't, then we
tack it on the end of the DVD

300
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,619
as like bonus footage or something.

301
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:24,759
- Fuck, yeah.

302
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:25,592
- Awesome.

303
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,130
Oh, can I, I'm going too, right?

304
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,239
'Cause I love camping.

305
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:29,599
- Sure, why not.

306
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,926
Ask Liz if she wants to be a PA on it.

307
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:31,799
- [Lois] Oh, okay.

308
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,849
- Well we figure we'll
go down on a Friday,

309
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,409
interview some townspeople

310
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,289
and then Saturday we'll go and track it

311
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:38,989
into the woods and see what we can get.

312
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,049
That should give us enough footage

313
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:41,369
to cut something together.

314
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:42,843
- Sounds like a plan,

315
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,129
and I know just the person who can track.

316
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,429
Roger Mason.

317
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:49,099
He's been a big game
hunter most of his life.

318
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,029
You and Chuck are going?

319
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,219
- Yes, we're going,

320
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:53,429
This is a production, you need a producer.

321
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,689
We are producers, sir.

322
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,429
Silvia? You're going to camp out with us?

323
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,189
- Yes. Why?

324
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:02,459
- Sorry, but you just don't
strike me as a camping person.

325
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:03,759
- Oh.

326
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:07,209
Well I'm not, but I checked
out the local hotels

327
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:09,321
and I'd rather be in a tent.

328
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,533
[Lois laughing]

329
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,429
[smooth guitar music]

330
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,559
- Merry Christmas, brother.

331
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:17,984
- Beautiful Christmas Day, isn't it?

332
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:18,817
- Yes, yes it is.

333
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:20,629
- Hey Dallas, I'm gonna
use the camera for a bit.

334
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:21,529
- Okay.

335
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,279
- No, I have never seen it,

336
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:31,709
but I have heard it on
three different occasions.

337
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:36,859
They were all in different locations,

338
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:41,926
but always near the woods and
always right around sundown.

339
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:49,269
It's a scream that will
make your blood run cold.

340
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,729
It's unlike anything you'll ever hear.

341
00:11:55,786 --> 00:12:00,019
Every time I heard it, I rushed home,

342
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,659
locked my doors and windows

343
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:05,769
and prayed that it didn't come around me.

344
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,269
- I'm Ken Banks, I live here in Riverdale.

345
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,479
- I hear you actually
encountered the creature

346
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:13,959
known as the Riverdale Monster.

347
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,349
- Yes sir, I did.

348
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,429
- [Dallas] Tell me about it.

349
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:18,379
It was about four years ago now.

350
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,029
I was huntin' back in the
woods following Willows Creek.

351
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,359
I hadn't had any luck.

352
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:25,679
No wild pigs, no deer, hell,
no raccoons or 'possums,

353
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,089
which is really odd.

354
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,389
Anyway, it started getting late

355
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,889
and I decided I should head
back and as I started back,

356
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:33,389
I heard something big
moving through the brush.

357
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:36,039
I mean branches snappin',
leaves crunchin'.

358
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:38,749
So I move into the brush so
I could get a shot at it.

359
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,859
As I came through the brush, there it was

360
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,799
from here to that car across the street.

361
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,029
That's how close it was.

362
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,339
- [Dallas] What was it?

363
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:46,172
- I don't know.

364
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:48,209
It wasn't a man, I can tell you that.

365
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:50,949
It stood about seven, maybe eight feet.

366
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,549
It stood upright like a man,

367
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:55,519
but its arms hung down to near its knees.

368
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,919
I couldn't make out its face,
there was too much hair.

369
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,019
All I could see were it's
red eyes lookin' at me.

370
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:00,919
- What happened?

371
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,129
- We stared at each other.

372
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,859
It couldn't have been
more than a few seconds,

373
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,399
but it seemed like forever.

374
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,349
My mouth went dry.

375
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,429
My heart was pounding in my chest.

376
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,869
It opened its mouth and let out a scream.

377
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,359
I thought I was gonna die.

378
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,379
- What did you do?

379
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,229
- I ran.

380
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:18,349
I just started running,
praying for God to help me.

381
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,299
I guess this was one of those
times it was in a good mood

382
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,132
'cause it didn't chase after me.

383
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,699
- Why didn't you shoot it?

384
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,089
- I was too scared.

385
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:26,389
The only thing I did was
piss myself when he roared

386
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:27,689
and then I took off running.

387
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,279
- I don't blame you.

388
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:31,179
Do you hunt in the area?

389
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,839
- No, no I don't hunt anymore

390
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,859
and I don't go near those woods.

391
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,459
- Oh yeah, you always hear shit.

392
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,729
Big foot and all that?

393
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:41,639
They say you don't go hunt in
those woods, but you don't.

394
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:42,472
That's the thing.

395
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:45,839
I mean it's a big stretch of
forest and nobody hunts in 'em.

396
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,479
Nobody hunts.

397
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:50,147
It's just not normal for
this part of the country.

398
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:52,309
- Yeah, I seen it.

399
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:54,759
Soon as I tell ya about it
though, you're just gonna make me

400
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,339
look like some kinda of crazy woman.

401
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:58,839
So, I don't-
- No, no, no.

402
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,169
Listen, that's not what we're here for.

403
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:01,002
I promise you.

404
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,835
I'm Chuck.

405
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,249
I'm the producer of this thing, all right?

406
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:05,839
We're not lookin' for anybody
to look crazy, I promise.

407
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,909
We're just, we just want
to hear people's stories.

408
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:09,989
We're trying to figure
out if this thing is real.

409
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,099
- Are you from around here?

410
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,239
- No, no.

411
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:15,549
I'm from up north originally,
but I live in Nashville now.

412
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,016
- Yeah, you look like a Yankee.

413
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,169
[Chuck laughing]

414
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:21,539
Well, Mr. Nashville, I seen him.

415
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:22,556
- What did you see?

416
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:25,699
- Well see, I like to fish.

417
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:26,789
- Okay.
- Okay?

418
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:30,759
So I took myself down to
Forest Creek, up by Watonka,

419
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,519
maybe six, seven in the morning.

420
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,449
You know, it's real early,
so I know I wasn't drinking.

421
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:38,779
Never really drank too much,
tends to spoil the day.

422
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:42,369
But anyway, I was out
there and I was casting off

423
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:44,579
and on my third or fourth cast,

424
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:47,449
I heard this noise comin'
from across the water.

425
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:49,289
It's kinda like a little inlay, you know?

426
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:53,939
So I get real quiet and kind
of crouch down, be still

427
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:56,179
'cause I'm thinking maybe
it's a doe and her fawn's

428
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,349
coming out to get to drink
water, you understand?

429
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,648
- [Dallas] Yeah.

430
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,959
- 'Cept all I saw was fur, brown fur,

431
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:05,829
and then I get all, what's it called?

432
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,996
Adrenaline rushes 'cause
my hair stands up on end

433
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:11,049
and I get all goose
pimpled and I'm thinking,

434
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:15,309
oh Lord, it's a bear and water
or no water, if he sees me,

435
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:17,049
he can make it over here and get at me,

436
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,609
'cept it wasn't a bear and that's that.

437
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,519
- [Dallas] What did it look like?

438
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,789
- Looked like a big old man,

439
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:28,359
you know, was what it looked like,

440
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:32,549
but about three sizes bigger
and it come out the brush,

441
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:36,036
it was lookin' at the
water and then I realized

442
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,596
it's lookin' at my line in the water

443
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:41,936
and it followed my line
all the way back up here

444
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,759
and it just looked right at me.

445
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:46,279
- [Dallas] You saw its face?

446
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,119
- Yep, stared right at me and it grunted,

447
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,986
then it made this noise, well it...

448
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:55,969
- [Chuck] Come on, it's all right.

449
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,329
- It howled at me.

450
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,269
It stared straight at me and howled

451
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,659
and I felt it in every bone in my body.

452
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,069
- [Dallas] Well, what did you do?

453
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,599
- Well, I couldn't move.

454
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,929
I didn't want to.

455
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:09,669
We just stood there and
stared at each other

456
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,159
across that little plug of water

457
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:14,069
for what felt like maybe three hours.

458
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,049
Coulda been 10 seconds, so I don't know,

459
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:19,799
but God picked that moment
for a fish to draw on my line.

460
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,989
Scared, I dropped my pole outta
shock, started to stand up,

461
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:26,169
but big feller, he stood up faster

462
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,622
and then he kind of crouched down,

463
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,309
like he was gonna rush at me.

464
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:33,679
You know, like a football
player gets all hunkered back?

465
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:36,759
I turned around and ran
like a bat outta hell.

466
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:39,029
Ran past my truck parked at the turn off,

467
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:39,996
got halfway back to town

468
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:43,429
before I calmed down
and get myself together.

469
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:47,149
True story, 'cept you
know, only took one time.

470
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,962
I told my friends and
they'll start rolling

471
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,899
their eyes at me, but I'm
telling you, that's what I saw.

472
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:59,109
- I'm Jamie Olson and I've lived
in Riverdale my whole life.

473
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:02,869
I saw the creature once
and once was enough.

474
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:05,869
I was about 12 years old and my parents

475
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:08,219
had gone out for the evening
and they let me hang out

476
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:11,336
with a friend of mine, she
was spending the night.

477
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,799
And so, you know, we
were just poppin' popcorn

478
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,599
and watchin' TV and all of a sudden

479
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,919
we hear some noises outside.

480
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,129
Um, you know, sounded like at first

481
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,849
maybe raccoons getting into the trashcan.

482
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,159
We went to look and couldn't see anything,

483
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:26,639
so I grabbed a flashlight.

484
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:30,249
Soon as I turned the flashlight on,

485
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,299
there, it was right outside the window.

486
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:35,568
It was huge and looking straight at us.

487
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:39,799
Anyway, of course we
screamed bloody murder

488
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:44,099
and then it let out
this scream of its own.

489
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,029
Anyway, obviously we called the police

490
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,759
and ran and hid in the
closet until they got there.

491
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,909
When they got there, they found tracks.

492
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:58,009
They found footprints, but nothing else.

493
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,479
I'll tell you one thing though,

494
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,599
I will never forget those
red eyes as long as I live.

495
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:09,019
- I mean, you know, hell,
it's a small town, right?

496
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,199
I mean, what else you gonna do here?

497
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,649
I mean, you're either gonna,
you're gonna get drunk,

498
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,499
you're gonna fuck, or you're
gonna make up bullshit stories.

499
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,829
You know, it's something to pass the time.

500
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,496
It's all ridiculous, I mean...

501
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:25,019
Hell, you know how many
thousands of pictures

502
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,669
people take every day, right?

503
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:29,279
And not a single person
has picked up a picture

504
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:33,379
of a alien or damn Sasquatch

505
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,762
or whatever the hell you wanna call it.

506
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,589
I mean, it's ridiculous.

507
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,869
Well know what, if you wanna believe it,

508
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:43,579
fuckin' believe it, all right?

509
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,089
It's, it's your thing, do it.

510
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,729
How about this? How about this?

511
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:50,549
How about we go with
Riverdale is just overrun

512
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:55,616
with alien Bigfoot monsters
or big, big feet monsters?

513
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:57,919
Big, Bigfoots?

514
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,439
Whatever the fuck, I mean it's all,

515
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,106
it's all nonsense anyway, right?

516
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,936
- [Dallas] State your name
and where you're from.

517
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,189
- I'd rather not.

518
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:13,976
- [Dallas] Can I ask why?

519
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,629
- I really shouldn't be doing this.

520
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:19,559
- [Dallas] Why?

521
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:25,439
- 'Cause I might expose myself to them.

522
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:26,619
- [Dallas] Them who?

523
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:31,479
- The secret government
agency that watches all of us.

524
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,529
- I see.

525
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:38,549
Well, make a name, pick out any name.

526
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:39,849
That'll throw 'em off.

527
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,469
- I don't know what name I should use.

528
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,339
- Any name is fine, really.

529
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,042
- Okay.

530
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:59,739
My name is Han solo and I'm from Tatooine.

531
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:08,389
- Okay Han, what do you
know about the creature?

532
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:13,536
- Well, I was driving home from Clarksburg

533
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,869
another night, late.

534
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:20,649
I just left The Wet Spot.

535
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,309
- Excuse me?

536
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:23,899
- The Wet Spot Bar.

537
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,059
- [Dallas] Oh, I'm sorry.

538
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:26,123
Go on.

539
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,956
- Okay.

540
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:29,866
So, I'm driving down Old Copper Road

541
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:33,589
and all of a sudden I see this thing

542
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,449
in front of me in the
headlights, so I hit the brakes.

543
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,746
And it was looking back at
me from the side of the road.

544
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,989
It must have been eight feet tall.

545
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:47,379
I guess I startled it 'cause
it was staring back at me

546
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,629
with these glowing red eyes.

547
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:56,969
Then it bent a sign with its shoulder.

548
00:20:57,036 --> 00:21:01,949
It just walked off the side
of the road, into the woods.

549
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:06,099
People say I was drunk,
but I know what I saw.

550
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,439
- So you told someone about it.

551
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:10,649
- I told everybody.

552
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:15,409
It wasn't until later that
I realized what it was.

553
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,309
- What was it?

554
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:22,419
- It was, uh, it was the
red eyes that gave it away.

555
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:29,489
It was robots sent by the
government to test the environment

556
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:33,099
and to spy on people
who live off the grid.

557
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:39,329
- Well Han, that was most informative.

558
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,959
- You gotta tell everybody,
you gotta warn 'em.

559
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:43,859
- Will do.

560
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,409
Well.

561
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:54,669
- [Liz] He looked normal.

562
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,899
- Yes. Yes he did.

563
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,749
- Yeah, there's a creature
out there all right.

564
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:03,799
I tracked it a couple years ago.

565
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:07,759
My buddy, Ben Jenkins, his property backs

566
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,506
right up against Mill Creek

567
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:13,419
and it started coming up
around his house at night.

568
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:17,939
Just scared his wife and
kids, like, half to death.

569
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:24,351
And so Ben called me to come
over and help him track it.

570
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,876
So I went over there that next morning

571
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,859
and it was easy at first.

572
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:32,759
Big footprints, you know.

573
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,189
But that thing gets in the creek

574
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:37,629
and it travels through the creek.

575
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:38,462
And we'd find prints.

576
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,329
You get out on this side, that side,

577
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,569
just keep on walkin', you know?

578
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,996
Damn near impossible to
track, but we found it

579
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:50,039
and we tracked it all day, way
back up deep into the woods.

580
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,249
I never been that far back in that woods.

581
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:58,116
But anyway, the sun started going down

582
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:01,792
and we decided we'd best
hightail it on outta there.

583
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:04,529
So headin' back to his house,

584
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,919
we just kept having this feeling

585
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,879
like somethin' is watchin' us, you know.

586
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:10,766
You ever have that feelin'?

587
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:15,289
And we'd stop and look and
listen and nothin' there.

588
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,269
We'd walk a ways, same thing.

589
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:23,999
So anyway, when we get back to his house,

590
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,459
we decided we'd just sit
out there with the shotguns

591
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:29,219
in the backyard and just, just wait.

592
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:33,319
And we weren't there long at all.

593
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:35,646
And that thing come
runnin' outta the woods

594
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,349
and we both got a shot off.

595
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,079
We hit it, it hit the ground
and it rolled right back up

596
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,833
and came right back at us, pissed off.

597
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:48,059
And it threw us both around
like we were rag dolls.

598
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,529
It knocked my gun a good 20 feet away,

599
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,419
broke my leg in like three
places, separated my shoulder.

600
00:23:57,156 --> 00:24:01,089
And Ben's house sets up on
a crawl space, you know?

601
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:02,806
'Cause it floods from that creek.

602
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:06,166
I managed to roll up under that house

603
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,579
and that how it saved my life.

604
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:11,209
It beat Ben to a pulp.

605
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,779
You don't wanna be out here at night.

606
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:19,063
There's definitely a creature out there.

607
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,559
- Hi officer, how are you?

608
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:31,849
- I'm Sheriff Cooper.

609
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:32,839
- Nice to meet you, Sheriff.

610
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:33,989
I'm Silvia Morgan

611
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,519
and this is my producing
partner, Chuck Jasper.

612
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:37,539
- Hi.

613
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:38,919
- What are folks filming here?

614
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:40,429
- Well, we're doing a short documentary

615
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:42,659
in your town about your alleged creature.

616
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,309
- There is no creature here.

617
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:48,149
Just a bunch of drunks and
crack pots making up stories.

618
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:48,982
- Well, that's good.

619
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:50,579
That'll make for pretty exciting footage

620
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:51,879
by itself, wouldn't it?

621
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:54,259
- We don't want our town
portrayed in that light.

622
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,519
- Sheriff, I spoke with
the mayor's office.

623
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:58,769
Your town doesn't require
a permit to film here.

624
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:01,170
We're well within our legal rights.

625
00:25:01,237 --> 00:25:04,380
- Don't start in on me about
your rights in my town.

626
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:06,560
- I spoke with the mayor's secretary.

627
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:08,298
- Ah, you spoke with Becky.

628
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,460
- Yes I did, and you are?

629
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:12,010
- I'm Mayor Robert Hill.

630
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,180
- Well, nice to meet you.

631
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,740
- Mr. Mayor, I spoke with
your assistant Russell

632
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:16,573
a couple of weeks ago.

633
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,406
We're the ones who are gonna be

634
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,630
doing the feature film "Anubis" in town.

635
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,160
- Yes, he mentioned it to me

636
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:24,130
and we're very excited about
you having a film project here

637
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:25,040
as far as that goes,

638
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,790
but we don't want Riverdale
turned into a joke.

639
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,930
- Well, that is never our intent.

640
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:36,280
- Of course not, but we
specifically do not publish stories

641
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:38,700
about men who've had a
little bit too much whiskey

642
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:41,680
that see monsters in the dark.

643
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:43,650
That's all we need is
anymore monster hunters

644
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:45,930
around here stirring things up.

645
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:46,860
There's nothing out there.

646
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:48,670
I know, I've lived here all my life.

647
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:50,550
- Mr. Mayor, are you telling us

648
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:51,990
that we can't continue filming here?

649
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:53,330
- No, not at all.

650
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:54,163
- Well, I am.

651
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,900
You're creating a public disturbance here.

652
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,903
You're gonna have to shut it down.

653
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,990
- Now, Jim, wait a minute, wait a minute.

654
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:02,040
These folks are gonna be
spending a lot of money

655
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:03,590
in this town in the next few months.

656
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:06,270
Let's not get off on the wrong foot.

657
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:07,790
- Thank you, Mayor.

658
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,110
- So how about I give you a
final interview for the day?

659
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,410
- Would we like a fi-

660
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:14,860
Would we like a final interview?

661
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,650
Yes, yes we would.

662
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:17,890
Why don't you come this way, Mr. Mayor.

663
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:19,330
We'll get you set right up.

664
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:22,940
- Sheriff.

665
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:28,530
- You know, Jim is a little more opposed

666
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:29,950
to this sort of thing than I am,

667
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:33,200
so perhaps you'd be
better off not shooting

668
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:36,640
so much of your shooting downtown

669
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:39,860
because well, after all he is the law.

670
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,070
- What about later when
we're shooting the film?

671
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:44,110
- Well that doesn't portray Riverdale

672
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:45,990
in a poor light, does it?

673
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:47,020
- No, no it doesn't.

674
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,937
- Well, then it should be no problem.

675
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:57,937
- Dallas. Dallas, I want
you to meet Mayor Hill.

676
00:26:58,004 --> 00:27:00,290
Mr. Mayor, this our director, Dallas.

677
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,837
- Great to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

678
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,180
- Mr. Mayor has graciously offered

679
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,350
to do our final interview for the day.

680
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:09,790
- Okay?

681
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:12,457
Mr. Mayor, if you would
just kindly stand over here.

682
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:15,940
To about right there.

683
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:21,730
If you would state your
name and where you're from.

684
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:24,740
- My name is Robert
Hill, Mayor Robert Hill.

685
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:26,620
I'm from Riverdale, Tennessee.

686
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:29,500
- What do you know about a creature

687
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,322
roaming the woods near here?

688
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:32,810
[Mayor Hill laughing]

689
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,950
- I have lived here all my life

690
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:38,340
and I have never, nor
has anyone I've ever met,

691
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,380
heard or seen this creature.

692
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:43,800
For years, there's been telling stories

693
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:47,130
about this dark, hairy, tall monster,

694
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:50,890
but it's just a tale, it's just a tale.

695
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:54,667
Tales designed maybe to scare kids like,

696
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:57,780
"behave yourself or I'll
have the monster get you."

697
00:27:57,847 --> 00:28:01,370
Just a legend, campfire tales.

698
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:02,900
Every place has one.

699
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:07,480
Come to Riverdale, enjoy a fine meal,

700
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,780
enjoy the scenery of the town,

701
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:12,290
but don't come expecting to see monsters

702
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,060
because you'll be disappointed.

703
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,010
- Okay.

704
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,040
Let's wrap it up.

705

That would be the little tin shack

you were thinking you were gonna see here.

786
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,620
I had this dog that I
loved, his name was Bailey.

787
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,300
One night, the beast
came in from the woods.

788
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:09,257
Well, Bailey went crazy
trying to get to this thing.

789
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,175
By the time I got dressed
and ran down outside,

790
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,760
he done killed Bailey.

791
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,127
Ripped him from his collar

792
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,950
and I found him smashed against the tree.

793
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:27,905
Ever since then, I've I tried to find out

794
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,265
everything I could about the Taku-he.

795
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,270
- Ta-co-hay?

796

- Taku, kinda like haiku, but with a T.

- Oh.

798
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:41,590
- If there was an incident
with somebody, I documented it.

799
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,677
And I also have some hair from the Taku-he

800
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:50,700
I found in this barbed
wire and have some photos.

801

- How long has he been around here?

802
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:57,440
- The best I can figure
is about 200 years.

803
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:58,550
- 200 Years?

804
00:33:58,617 --> 00:34:00,680
Nobody's caught it or killed it?

- Many have tried, but no.

Well, I myself have been
on eight tracking attempts

807
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:11,330
and we found what we call it's camp.

808

but not the real thing.

00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,120

bones scattered around,

811
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,440
you know, not too old.

812
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:29,617
The best I could figure is
that it came to this den

813
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,907
whenever it was close to town.

814
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:38,930
And it's real home is way back in there.

815
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,940
- Well, why do you think
sometimes he's passive

816
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:43,480
and the other times violent?

817
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:49,023
- Well, it could be the cycle of the moon.

818
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,350
It could be maybe when
someone tries to hurt it.

819
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:58,194
But I can tell you one
thing, is that you do not

820
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,530
wanna be around this
thing when it is pissed.

821
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:04,770
- In one of the interviews we did,

822
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:08,590
I that was told that a friend
was killed by the Taku-he.

823
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:13,004
- The best I can figure,
there'd been about 15 attacks

824
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:16,960
and deaths over the years.

825
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:20,587
The most at one time was five.

That was back around about 1910.

I don't believe in ghosts

878
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:31,100
- No offense, but I hope
you don't get your wish.

879
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,420
It hasn't been by for
a couple of nights now.

880
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,431
I'd like it to stay that way.

881
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:38,680
[both laughing]

882
00:37:38,747 --> 00:37:41,053
- Hey, I brought you all
some sandwiches and snacks.

883
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,886
- Oh, thanks.

884
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:42,719
You didn't have to do that.

885
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:43,790
- Oh, I know, I wanted to.

886
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:44,950
- [Lois] Aw, thanks.

887
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:47,730
- Hey, let me ask you something.

888
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:48,570
- [Sally] Sure.

889
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:50,960
- I know we can't go into the house,

890
00:37:51,926 --> 00:37:53,860
but what if we have to go to the bathroom?

891
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:56,630
- Well, there's the woods right here.

892
00:37:56,697 --> 00:37:57,530
- Oh.

893
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,780
- You know, or past the
house down by the field,

894
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,750
we do have an outhouse.

895
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:04,583
It's old.

896
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,870
I mean, you're gonna have,
there's gonna be some spiders

897
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:09,830
and the occasional snake,
but it'll do the job.

898
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:10,990
You do have a gun, right?

899
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:12,207
You should bring a gun.

900
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:14,142
- Uh.

901
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,442
- I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

902
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:17,770
[Lois laughing]

903
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,190
Yeah, okay, well, I'll see
you all in the morning.

904
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,980
I'm gonna make a big
breakfast for everybody.

905
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:23,150
- Oh, you don't have to do that.

906
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,140
We're gonna leave out really early.

907
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:27,800
We'll probably see you
late tomorrow afternoon.

908
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:31,060
- But you're gonna be home
by sunset though, right?

909
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,500
- If it does come by tonight,

910
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:36,500
my advice to y'all, stay in the tents.

911
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,290
Don't wanna startle it or piss it off.

912
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,550
It can do some serious damage.

913
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,067
- Thanks for the advice, Jim.

914
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:47,440
- How are the tents?

915
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:48,273
- [Wes] Up and good to go.

916
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,200
- [Dallas] Good.

917
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:52,750
- So, are we officially
locked out for the night?

918
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,040
- Yep, we are.

919
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,410
If anybody wants to make
for a hotel tonight,

920
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:58,480
now is your last chance to go.

921
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:01,297
[birds chirping]

922
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:05,220
Silvia.

923
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:06,190
- What?

924
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,640
Why do you guys always look at me

925
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:09,560
when you talk about sleeping in tents?

926
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,920
- [Wes] Did you or did you not
say your idea of roughing it

927
00:39:11,987 --> 00:39:13,130
was no room service?

928
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,950
- Yes, I did say that.

929
00:39:16,017 --> 00:39:18,290
That doesn't mean I can't do this.

930
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm a woman, I can do whatever I want,

931
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,330
including sleeping in a tent.

932
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:24,740
- Ooh, I'm impressed.

933
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:27,190
- Just because I prefer
not to do something

934
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:29,087
doesn't mean I can't do it.

935
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:30,960
And now if you'll excuse me,

936
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:35,980
I'm gonna go use an outhouse.

937
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:40,250
Again, something I prefer
not to do, but I can do it.

938
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:42,773
- Bravo, bravo.
- Bravo.

939
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,562
- I'm so inspired.

940
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:45,395
- Look at that guys.

941
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:46,750
Magic hour everybody, look at that.

942
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:51,659
[peaceful music]

943
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,980
- Wes, get some coverage of this.

944
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,250
I suppose I should, too.

945
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:01,853
Lois?

946
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,701
- Way ahead of you, Dallas.

947
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:05,122
- [Dallas] Oh, thank you.

948
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:07,939
[birds chirping]

949
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:11,230
- [Chuck] Yeah.

950
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:15,593
That's good, that's good.

951
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,426
Okay, pull it up.

952
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:17,326
There you go.

953
00:40:20,577 --> 00:40:23,880
- So, what would it take for
this trip to be successful?

954
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:26,030
- Oh, I would love to
get some video footage

955
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:26,863
of the creature.

956
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,540
That would be so awesome.

957
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,170
But even if we don't get to see it,

958
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:33,190
I think this trip has been pretty amazing.

959
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:34,064
And I-

960
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,131
[creature growling]

961
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,080
- What is that?
- What is that?

962
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:42,980
- Quiet.

963
00:40:44,296 --> 00:40:47,296
[creature growling]

964
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,046
Oh my God.

965
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:52,900
Did you get that?

966
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,047
Tell me somebody got that.

967
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:58,149
- I'll let you know in a minute.

968
00:40:58,216 --> 00:41:00,966
Oh shit, if I could quit shaking.

969
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:06,646
- [Video] But even if
we don't get to see it,

970
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,325
I think this trip has been pretty amazing.

971
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:10,158
And I-

972
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:11,347
[creature growling]

973
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:12,800
- Oh, there it is.

974
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:14,727
- Oh my God, I can't believe it.

975
00:41:14,794 --> 00:41:16,370
- [Silvia] What was that?

976
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,698
- That, darling, was the creature.

977
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:21,765
[everyone laughing]

978
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:27,730
- So why are we not sitting around a fire?

979
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:28,980
- We don't wanna scare the creature off.

980
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:31,000
- You know what, after
hearing that thing scream,

981
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,650
I'm okay with scaring it off.

982
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:35,280
- It won't hurt my feelings
if it doesn't come around.

983
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:36,820
- Well, now that we know
it's real, it's out there,

984
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:37,950
are we changing the game plan?

985
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,971
- Wait, we don't know it's real.

986
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:41,661
- Silvia, you heard it.

987
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:43,131
- We heard something.

988
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:45,861
- Wait, somebody with a sound
system recording device,

989
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:48,211
they could have pulled
that off, if it was a hoax.

990
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:49,731
- You think you heard a recording?

991
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,921
- I'm saying it's possible, yeah, maybe.

992
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:54,701
- Look, we got a lot of
hiking to do tomorrow,

993
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:57,611
so I don't think we all need
to be staying up waiting.

994
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,151
We'll have one lookout.

995
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:01,191
That person will let us know it's coming

996
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:03,248
so we can get out of the tents.

997
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,731
I don't wanna risk startling
it if it enters the camp.

998
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:10,191
We start filming, stay
hidden so it doesn't see us.

999
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,511
- Oh, Dallas, that reminds me.

1000
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:13,511
I have a present for you.

1001
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:14,344
- What?

1002
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:16,271
- I mounted the camera up
in that tree over there.

1003
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:18,811
It's motion activated
and has night vision.

1004
00:42:18,878 --> 00:42:20,661
That thing comes in the
camp, we will get it.

1005
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:23,099
- And that folks is why I love Wes.

1006
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:23,932
- [Lois] Aw.

1007
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:24,765
- [Chuck] Very sweet.

1008
00:42:24,832 --> 00:42:25,598
- Can we snuggle later in my tent?

1009
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:26,431
- Uh, no.

1010
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:27,830
- Oh.

1011
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:31,814
[insects buzzing and chirping]

1012
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:34,971
- Are we safe?

1013
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:36,981
- These tents can withstand anything.

1014
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:38,181
[Lois and Chuck laughing]

1015
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,181
- It is a serious question.

1016
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:41,661
How much danger are we in?

1017
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,471
- I don't know, it's as dangerous

1018
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:46,051
as being near any large wild animal.

1019
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:50,691
Didn't you guys realize that
it could be a little dangerous?

1020
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:53,031
- I didn't think we'd find anything.

1021
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:55,641
Every time I think about
that sound, I get chills.

1022
00:42:57,378 --> 00:42:58,791
[creature growling]
[Lois screaming]

1023
00:42:58,858 --> 00:42:59,624
- God.

1024
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:01,271
Oh, Wes, you're such an asshole.

1025
00:43:01,338 --> 00:43:02,151
- Seriously, if you do that again,

1026
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:05,041
I'm gonna shove that
camera right up your ass.

1027
00:43:05,108 --> 00:43:06,541
- Wes, you are an asshole.

1028
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:10,211
Granted, you're an asshole
with impeccable timing.

1029
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:11,184
Still.

1030
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:13,011
[everyone laughing]

1031
00:43:13,078 --> 00:43:15,601
- [Dallas] And with that,
I'll take the first watch.

1032
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,631
Everyone, get some sleep.

1033
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:19,791
Chuck, I'll wake you up
to take your turn at one.

1034
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,923
- [Chuck] Sounds like a plan.

1035
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,490
[tense music]

1036
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:41,491
- You're really into this, aren't you?

1037
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:44,021
- Oh yeah, you better believe it.

1038
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,542
- Why?

1039
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:46,375
- You kidding?

1040
00:43:46,442 --> 00:43:48,111
I've been into Bigfoot
since I was a teenager.

1041
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:50,541
I mean, I know this isn't a Bigfoot

1042
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:53,241
but at the very least it's
some kind of family member.

1043
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:55,311
Believe me, getting
some footage of this guy

1044
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:56,578
will be career changing.

1045
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:03,191
- So, how'd you get started anyway?

1046
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:04,111
- Doing this?

1047
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,271
- [Silvia] Yeah.

1048
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:09,331
- Well that is, um,
that's a loaded question.

1049
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:10,791
- How so?

1050
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:12,481
- Doesn't have a happy answer.

1051
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:15,081
- I'm intrigued.

1052
00:44:18,778 --> 00:44:20,721
- All right, you asked for it.

1053
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:23,971
When I graduated business college,

1054
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,381
I wanted to be a financial advisor

1055
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:27,518
and make my living dealing
in the stock market.

1056
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:28,606
[Silvia laughing]

1057
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:29,581
- You?

1058
00:44:29,648 --> 00:44:30,698
- Yeah right, I know.

1059
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:36,075
Now my dad, my dad, he was the artist.

1060
00:44:37,078 --> 00:44:38,391
Man, could he paint.

1061
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:41,658
He was an even better photographer.

1062
00:44:42,668 --> 00:44:45,011
And unfortunately he
couldn't make a living

1063
00:44:45,078 --> 00:44:46,021
in either one of those two,

1064
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:49,261
so he ended up in a
career selling insurance.

1065
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:54,611
He hated that business, but you know,

1066
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:56,241
bills to pay, mouths to feed.

1067
00:44:57,748 --> 00:45:00,311
Anyway, one morning he wakes
up with a screaming headache

1068
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,911
and everything he tries
doesn't seem to work,

1069
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:06,481
so he goes to the doctor
and they run some tests.

1070
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:10,908
Next thing I know he's
in the hospital with a...

1071
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:14,671
Oh, fuck.

1072
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:18,441
Next thing I know, he's in the hospital

1073
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,091
with an inoperable brain tumor
and only days left to live.

1074
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:22,751
- Oh my God.

1075
00:45:25,578 --> 00:45:26,981
- Then he tells me on his deathbed

1076
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:30,001
that he always thought my
photography was really good,

1077
00:45:31,082 --> 00:45:32,721
that I should do it for a living.

1078
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:36,838
Said he thought I'd have
a happier life if I did.

1079
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:40,778
By morning, he was gone.

1080
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,921
[Silvia sighs]

1081
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:46,091
- I'm so sorry.

1082
00:45:47,028 --> 00:45:49,421
- What was I supposed to do, you know?

1083
00:45:49,488 --> 00:45:50,811
It was his dying wish.

1084
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:57,551
So I traded in Wall Street
and started doing this.

1085
00:45:59,018 --> 00:46:00,818
Told you didn't have a happy ending.

1086
00:46:03,818 --> 00:46:05,591
- So, was he right?

1087
00:46:05,658 --> 00:46:06,758
Have you been happier?

1088
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:09,481
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

1089
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:13,511
But you know, I still
sometimes wonder, what if?

1090
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,208
This was his camera.

1091
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,861
I take it on the set every time I go.

1092
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:23,644
Always makes me feel

1093
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:25,658
like he's right there with me, you know?

1094
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:31,971
Anyway, you better get to bed.

1095
00:46:34,273 --> 00:46:38,190
[insects buzzing and chirping]

1096
00:46:44,777 --> 00:46:45,841
- Nope.

1097
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:47,331
- I'm not sure how much sleep I'll get

1098
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:48,651
knowing that thing is out there.

1099
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:49,911
- Oh, you should try.

1100
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:51,381
Tomorrow's gonna be a bitch hike.

1101
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:53,851
- You don't sound like
you're too thrilled with it.

1102
00:46:53,918 --> 00:46:54,684
- I'm not.

1103
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:55,861
- Oh, you're not thrilled with it?

1104
00:46:55,928 --> 00:46:56,741
I love camping.

1105
00:46:56,808 --> 00:46:58,851
- Oh I do, I do love camping.
- I like to camp.

1106
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:00,421
- Camping is with vodka.

1107
00:47:00,488 --> 00:47:01,254
- You win.

1108
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:02,631
- Uh huh.

1109
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,061
You know, when it comes
to Chuck and Dallas,

1110
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:05,881
I will do what needs to be done.

1111
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,778
- She sounds sarcastic, but she means that

1112
00:47:07,845 --> 00:47:08,931
and that's why we love her.

1113
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:11,085
We love Lois.

1114
00:47:11,152 --> 00:47:11,994
- He's a flatterer.

1115
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:13,201
- This woman is part of our family.

1116
00:47:13,268 --> 00:47:15,521
She started off when Dallas
and I first did a feature.

1117
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:16,901
She's been family ever since.

1118
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,541
Family, capital F.

1119
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:20,231
- Yep, they mean that.

1120
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:23,565
They were there for me
during my sucky marriage.

1121
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,005
- God, Todd.

1122
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:26,058
- And even suckier divorce.

1123
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,425
- "Did you take the pool?"

1124
00:47:28,408 --> 00:47:29,361
- They didn't have to there for me,

1125
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:31,251
but they were, the whole time.

1126
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:32,624
- That's because she is family.

1127
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:35,384
You is family, kid.

1128
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:36,381
That's just how it works.

1129
00:47:36,448 --> 00:47:37,881
Look, if you're working
with me and Dallas,

1130
00:47:37,948 --> 00:47:38,751
that's how we look at it.

1131
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:40,181
Everybody who works with us is family.

1132
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:41,014
- That means you.

1133
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:41,879
- Yes.

1134
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,671
You also have to know this,
every day that we shoot,

1135
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:45,431
that's like Christmas Day.

1136
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:47,411
- That's an awesome outlook.

1137
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:48,244
- They're pretty great.

1138
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:50,871
- We just believe in
treating everybody right.

1139
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,161
Dignity, respect.

1140
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:53,741
Unless you're a jackass cop and a mayor

1141
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:54,574
who decide to walk in-

1142
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:55,791
- Behave, behave.
- Come on, seriously.

1143
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:56,624
We're on the street.

1144
00:47:56,691 --> 00:47:58,695
- So, when did Silvia
start working with you?

1145
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:01,701
- Silvia came in three back.

1146
00:48:01,768 --> 00:48:03,301
- Two.

1147
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:05,425
- Silvia came in two
back, oh, the festival.

1148
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:06,681
[Lois laughing]

1149
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:09,091
Okay, we're at this film festival.

1150
00:48:09,158 --> 00:48:10,468
That's right because the zombie thing.

1151
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:11,811
All right, yeah, she's gonna hear us.

1152
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:13,021
Okay, okay, okay.

1153
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:16,381
We're at a film festival,
we're showing all Texas films.

1154
00:48:16,448 --> 00:48:17,214
It's done.

1155
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:19,321
We don't know her, she just walks up to us

1156
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:21,458
and immediately she comes right up to me,

1157
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,725
"excuse me, I believe I can
take Dallas to the next level."

1158
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:28,101
- And she did.
- She did.

1159
00:48:28,168 --> 00:48:29,241
- I mean, she did, we gave her a shot.

1160
00:48:29,308 --> 00:48:30,591
She came in, she's awesome.

1161
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,421
She fits in, she's great, it's just, yeah.

1162
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:34,081
- Oh, you and she make a good pair.

1163
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:35,751
I mean, she thinks about the numbers

1164
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:36,711
and you think about the people.

1165
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:37,697
It works.

1166
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:38,553
- Well, she's really, really good

1167
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,901
at bringing something in on budget.

1168
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:41,111
And she's good at getting the money,

1169
00:48:41,178 --> 00:48:42,991
the finances are all there.

1170
00:48:43,058 --> 00:48:43,864
I couldn't have gotten Dallas to the level

1171
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:46,171
that she's gotten us at, so.

1172
00:48:46,238 --> 00:48:47,198
So that's good that she's family.

1173
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:48,321
It's good that she's in.

1174
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:49,811
It's good that you're family too

1175
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:53,638
and it's good that you're
in, so welcome to the family.

1176
00:48:53,705 --> 00:48:54,883
- Thanks.

1177
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,681
Right now, I could
really use a new family.

1178
00:48:56,748 --> 00:48:57,591
- Oh.

1179
00:48:57,658 --> 00:48:58,611
- Back story.

1180
00:48:58,678 --> 00:49:00,261
- We call that a plot point.

1181
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:01,875
Spill it.

1182
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,442
[tense music]

1183
00:49:15,672 --> 00:49:18,422
[Dallas yawning]

1184
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:33,285
[insects buzzing and chirping]

1185
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:45,419
[creature grunting]

1186
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:10,985
[creature growling]

1187
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:36,441
- That was close.

1188
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:37,909
- Sounds like it's in the camp.

1189
00:50:37,976 --> 00:50:38,742
Give me the camera.

1190
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,392
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1191
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:43,619
- Where are you going?

1192
00:50:43,686 --> 00:50:47,688
[loud thud]
[everyone screams]

1193
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,360
- Oh God, it's out there.

1194
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:51,677
- No, it's here, it's here.

1195
00:50:54,707 --> 00:50:57,288
- Don't, don't you dare leave me.

1196
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:58,139
- Shh.

1197
00:50:58,206 --> 00:50:59,706
- No, what're you-

1198
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:02,048
What're you doing?

1199
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:02,881
Stop.

1200
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:04,639
[loud thud]

1201
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:06,349
[creature growling]

1202
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:08,916
- Don't piss it off, shh, shh.

1203
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:15,109
[everyone shouting]

1204
00:51:21,268 --> 00:51:23,362
[creature growling]

1205
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,992
- Where is he, where is he?

1206
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:27,339
[Silvia screaming]

1207
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:28,823
He's right there.

1208
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:47,208
[loud thud]

1209
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,856
[creature growling]

1210
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:05,295
[frenzied music]

1211
00:52:06,538 --> 00:52:08,659
- Dammit Sally, when's this little project

1212
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:09,771
gonna be finished?

1213
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,961
- Hush, he's out there.

1214
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,978
- Doesn't sound too happy with
them out there, now does it?

1215
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:17,371
- I can't see them from here.

1216
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:20,831
- Well, we haven't heard any
screams yet, so that's good.

1217
00:52:20,898 --> 00:52:22,811
- We should have never let them do this.

1218
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:26,971
- Hey, they paid us $2,000
to camp on our land tonight.

1219
00:52:27,038 --> 00:52:28,951
Now they're getting just what they wanted,

1220
00:52:29,018 --> 00:52:32,041
up close and in person
with the Riverdale Monster.

1221
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:38,638
- I don't hear it anymore.

1222
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:39,471
- I think it's gone.

1223
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:42,088
- No it isn't, it's out there.

1224
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:42,991
- It's alright.
- It's waiting for us.

1225
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:44,591
- Liz, Liz, calm down.

1226
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:46,258
I think, really think it's gone.

1227
00:52:47,948 --> 00:52:48,811
- Please don't.

1228
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:51,028
- It'll be all right,
don't worry about it.

1229
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:53,898
[zipper clattering]

1230
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:55,861
[everyone screaming]

1231
00:52:55,928 --> 00:52:57,441
- Jesus, really?

1232
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,751
Oh.

1233
00:52:58,818 --> 00:52:59,721
Are you guys alright?

1234
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:02,011
- Besides the heart
attack you just gave us?

1235
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,001
- [Chuck] God.

1236
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:03,851
- [Silvia] Are you okay?

1237
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,521
- [Chuck] I'm fine.

1238
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:06,354
- [Dallas] What happened?

1239
00:53:06,421 --> 00:53:07,254
- I-

1240
00:53:08,848 --> 00:53:09,661
I fell asleep, all right?

1241
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,841
I fell asleep, I'm sorry.

1242
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:11,674
I was out there by the tree.

1243
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:12,771
I fell asleep, I opened my eyes,

1244
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:14,240
the thing is right in front of me.

1245
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:15,282
It was, it was breathing down at me,

1246
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:16,811
it started, it made that
noise, it made the noise

1247
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:19,091
So I, I, I, I played dead.

1248
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:20,482
I played dead is what I did.

1249
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:21,315
- [Wes] What'd it look like?

1250
00:53:21,382 --> 00:53:22,611
- It looked like, it was huge.

1251
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:23,444
It was covered in fur.

1252
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:24,641
Did you not see it?

1253
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:26,141
- We were trapped in the tent.

1254
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:28,125
- Jesus Christ, it was-

1255
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,071
Jesus, Dal-

1256
00:53:33,138 --> 00:53:34,161
Dallas, I let you down, all right?

1257
00:53:34,228 --> 00:53:36,008
I'm sorry I let you down, I'm sorry.

1258
00:53:36,075 --> 00:53:37,701
- It's okay, it's cool, it's cool.

1259
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:40,211
- Is it gone?

1260
00:53:40,278 --> 00:53:41,044
- Yes.

1261
00:53:41,111 --> 00:53:43,261
- No, I mean, is it really
gone and not coming back?

1262
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:44,621
- Liz, it's gone.

1263
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,851
It's not coming back.

1264
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,171
- I've got a bottle of whiskey in the car.

1265
00:53:47,238 --> 00:53:48,591
It might calm her nerves.

1266
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:49,721
- [Chuck] It might calm
everybody's nerves.

1267
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:50,651
- Go get it.

1268
00:53:50,718 --> 00:53:51,611
- Hold on, I'll go with you.

1269
00:53:51,678 --> 00:53:52,528
- I, uh...

1270
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:55,868
I have to change my pants.

1271
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:00,770
- [Wes] Hey.

1272
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,670
Let's see what we got.

1273
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:06,286
[anxious music]

1274
00:54:13,778 --> 00:54:15,621
- There it is, awesome.

1275
00:54:17,149 --> 00:54:19,001
- Dammit, it's blurry.

1276
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:21,931
I needed sharp focus so
there's no doubt it's real.

1277
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:23,161
- We know it's real.

1278
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,051
- Yeah, but I need it to be clear.

1279
00:54:26,118 --> 00:54:27,191
This is the money shot.

1280
00:54:27,258 --> 00:54:29,101
- Look, people who believe, will believe.

1281
00:54:29,168 --> 00:54:30,481
The others won't.

1282
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:31,651
Don't worry about it.

1283
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:33,168
- Yeah, yeah, shit, whatever.

1284
00:54:39,328 --> 00:54:41,421
- How you doing, Liz?

1285
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:44,221
- I feel a little better, thanks.

1286
00:54:44,288 --> 00:54:46,381
- I don't think we were
in any real danger.

1287
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:48,041
- How can you say that?

1288
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:49,591
- These tents are flimsy.

1289
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:51,621
It could have ripped
through it like butter

1290
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,671
and it didn't attack Chuck.

1291
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:56,841
I think it gets violent when provoked.

1292
00:54:56,908 --> 00:54:58,241
- I think you might be right.

1293
00:54:58,308 --> 00:54:59,501
- Makes sense.

1294
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:01,311
- Mind you, I wouldn't want to provoke it.

1295
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:03,811
That I think would be extremely dangerous.

1296
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:06,001
- Sure felt like we were in danger.

1297
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:06,901
- Amen.

1298
00:55:07,778 --> 00:55:09,961
- Look, I was scared shitless too.

1299
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:12,261
Don't get me wrong, it was very scary,

1300
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:14,481
but I think it was more us than it.

1301
00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:17,361
- [Wes] When is Roger getting here?

1302
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:18,291
- 5:00 AM.

1303
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,271
- Wait, you're not still
doing this, are we?

1304
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:21,801
- Sure, why not?

1305
00:55:21,868 --> 00:55:23,561
- Because it's real.

1306
00:55:23,628 --> 00:55:25,191
- I always knew that it was.

1307
00:55:25,258 --> 00:55:27,221
- Well, I didn't.

1308
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:31,651
- Look, tomorrow is gonna be
more like a walk in the woods.

1309
00:55:31,718 --> 00:55:33,371
I doubt we'll see anything.

1310
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:34,204
- Yeah, it's nocturnal.

1311
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,361
The most we'll see are some footprints.

1312
00:55:36,428 --> 00:55:38,961
- Nobody has to go if nobody wants to.

1313
00:55:39,028 --> 00:55:40,301
You can stay here.

1314
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:44,281
- No, I'll go.

1315
00:55:44,348 --> 00:55:46,650
- Seriously, Silvia, you
can stay here if you want.

1316
00:55:46,717 --> 00:55:48,221
- I am your producer, I'm going.

1317
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:49,428
- I can be the onsite producer.

1318
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:50,701
- I said I'm going.

1319
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:54,024
'Sides, you're dry cleaning bill

1320
00:55:54,091 --> 00:55:55,410
is already gonna blow the budget.

1321
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,392
[everyone laughing]

1322
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:58,960
- That's funny because I pissed myself.

1323
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:02,567
So the dry cleaning bills are
already gonna blow the budget.

1324
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:03,400
[Silvia laughing]

1325
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:04,233
- Liz, Lois?

1326
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,938
Either of you wanna stay?

1327
00:56:06,005 --> 00:56:08,271
- I think you're right about it, I'll go.

1328
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:09,104
- Me too.

1329
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:10,251
- Are you sure?

1330
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:11,521
- Yeah.

1331
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:13,851
If Chuck is going, I can go too.

1332
00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:15,425
- Thank you, Liz.

1333
00:56:15,492 --> 00:56:16,468
It's another cut on me, right?

1334
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:17,841
That's what that was?

1335
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,061
- Nah, no, no, no.

1336
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,561
[Silvia laughing]

1337
00:56:23,628 --> 00:56:25,128
- What time is it?

1338
00:56:26,268 --> 00:56:28,751
- Oh, it's 3:30.

1339
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,471
- Let's grab some more sleep.

1340
00:56:30,538 --> 00:56:32,391
- Can we grab some more
sleep inside the tents?

1341
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,531
Like, all of us this time?

1342
00:56:34,598 --> 00:56:36,031
- I thought you prefer
sleeping under a tree.

1343
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:39,691
- And that's funny because I
fell asleep under the tree.

1344
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:41,011
You guys are great.

1345
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:46,837
[truck engine humming]

1346
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:54,556
[truck beeping]

1347
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:58,041
- Roger, glad you can make it.

1348
00:56:58,108 --> 00:57:00,231
- Of course, I wouldn't
turn it down for nothing.

1349
00:57:00,298 --> 00:57:02,241
- Let me introduce you to my team.

1350
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:05,871
Wes, Lois, Chuck, Liz, and Silvia.

1351
00:57:05,938 --> 00:57:06,704
- Nice to meet y'all.

1352
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,901
Let me grab my rifle real
quick and I'll be ready.

1353
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:10,071
- Your rifle?

1354
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,631
- Yeah, I don't do any big
game hunting without it.

1355
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:12,751
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1356
00:57:12,818 --> 00:57:13,931
We don't wanna kill this thing.

1357
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:14,764
- Oh, I'm not wantin' to kill it either.

1358
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:15,741
It's just for protection.

1359
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:16,971
Dallas, can you help me out please.

1360
00:57:17,038 --> 00:57:19,541
- Guys, it's like he
said, it's for protection.

1361
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:24,299
- Holy shit.

1362
00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:28,021
- I'm ready.

1363
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:29,441
- We have something to show you.

1364
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:30,611
- Okay, let's do it.

1365
00:57:33,718 --> 00:57:35,161
Okay, let's get a move on.

1366
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:36,741
- You don't seem too surprised.

1367
00:57:36,808 --> 00:57:37,574
- I'm here to track something,

1368
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:40,371
whether it's real or fake or
farmer John in an ape suit.

1369
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:42,088
We're burning daylight, let's go.

1370
00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:46,188
- We're burning daylight.

1371
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,113
Let's go.

1372
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:54,982
[tense music]

1373
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:19,194
- That way we can find
our way back easier.

1374
00:58:21,684 --> 00:58:24,601
[leaves crunching]

1375
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:29,062
- Can we take a break?

1376
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:30,062
- [Roger] Yeah, go ahead and take five.

1377
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:31,502
- [Chuck] Thank God.

1378
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,272
- You keep a hearty pace, Roger.

1379
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:35,431
- [Wes] Here, I gotta pee.

1380
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:36,264
- [Dallas] Okay.

1381
00:59:36,331 --> 00:59:37,164
- [Wes] Be careful.

1382
00:59:38,332 --> 00:59:39,297
- Now I'm just trying
to keep this trail up

1383
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:40,130
before it goes cold.

1384
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:42,062
This creature of yours is pretty smart.

1385
00:59:42,129 --> 00:59:43,392
- How so?

1386
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:44,792
- It keeps doubling back,

1387
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:46,552
covering his trail a little
bit better every time.

1388
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,302
- Yeah, that's what the
hunters have been saying.

1389
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:52,412
People track it, say that he's
easy to follow for a while,

1390
00:59:52,479 --> 00:59:54,073
then he gets smart.

1391
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,672
- [Roger] I can see that being true, yeah.

1392
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,672
- So what all have you hunted?

1393
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:01,662
- Mostly bigger game, bear, elk, moose.

1394
01:00:01,729 --> 01:00:02,872
- Moose and squirrel.

1395
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:06,272
- Funny, but no, I like
the really big ones.

1396
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:08,362
Panthers, lions, tigers.

1397
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:10,479
You know, I like the danger of the sport.

1398
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:14,622
- I thought handlers and
guides did all the hard work.

1399
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:16,482
- I'm not some dentist out here

1400
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:18,822
luring these tame animals
into their slaughter, okay?

1401
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:20,092
I like to get up close and personal

1402
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,002
and feel the trigger
pull when I kill them.

1403
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:26,102
- That's nice, so you're
just plain crazy, right?

1404
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:27,002
- Maybe.

1405
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:32,292
[tense music continues]

1406
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:48,772
[leaves and twigs crunching]

1407
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:28,317
- Hey.

1408
01:02:30,089 --> 01:02:31,712
This son of a bitch is
either really, really good

1409
01:02:31,779 --> 01:02:33,522
or he's got us totally lost.

1410
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:35,552
- He's very good, trust me.

1411
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:44,465
- Y'all can take a break.

1412
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:45,898
Trail's gone cold.

1413
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:47,742
- [Liz] Does that mean
we can head back now?

1414
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:49,012
- No, I'm gonna double back around

1415
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:50,452
and see if I can pick the trail up again.

1416
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:52,272
- No problem, take your time.

1417
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,772
- Mind if I tag along?

1418
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,194
- If you're up for it, let's go.

1419
01:02:56,261 --> 01:02:57,261
- [Wes] Yes.

1420
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:04,892
- Oh, my feet are killin' me.

1421
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,072
- You're tellin' me.

1422
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:07,722
- Well, call me crazy,

1423
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:11,122
but I think all this fresh
air might be bad for you.

1424
01:03:11,189 --> 01:03:12,412
- Amen.

1425
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:15,132
- At least it's better than last night.

1426
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,332
- You, know, speaking of
last night, don't you think

1427
01:03:17,399 --> 01:03:19,752
we should start heading
back before it gets dark?

1428
01:03:19,819 --> 01:03:21,869
- When Roger gets back, we'll pack it in.

1429
01:03:22,728 --> 01:03:25,893
[water burbling]

1430
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,210
[pensive guitar music]

1431
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:37,152
- I hate these things.

1432
01:03:38,129 --> 01:03:38,982
- You can always have some

1433
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:40,982
of Chuck and Dallas's reddish fish.

1434
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:42,962
I'm sure he brought 'em out here.

1435
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,795
Let's go ask him.

1436
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,132
- No, I can't.

1437
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:47,582
I already...

1438
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:49,702
- Already what?

1439
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:53,842
- I just...

1440
01:03:55,509 --> 01:03:56,452
Nevermind.

1441
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:57,285
I've already done enough.

1442
01:03:57,352 --> 01:03:58,122
- No, no, wait, what?

1443
01:03:58,189 --> 01:03:59,112
What's going on?

1444
01:03:59,179 --> 01:04:00,712
- I said it's nothing.

1445
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:01,689
I'm just ready to go.

1446
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:04,206
- No, I think we need to
stay here just a minute.

1447
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:07,482
I'm right here.

1448
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:08,382
Talk to me.

1449
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:12,432
- I'm just...

1450
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:18,072
I've spent so long feeling like everything

1451
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:19,822
I touch is just falling apart,

1452
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,952
like I can never do anything right.

1453
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:23,785
- No, honey.

1454
01:04:23,852 --> 01:04:24,959
- I know it's just...

1455
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:29,072
Stupid, but it's like,

1456
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:32,349
I'm finally doing what I want for me

1457
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:34,918
and I've already gone and screwed it up.

1458
01:04:34,985 --> 01:04:36,882
- What did you screw up?

1459
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:38,122
- Everything.

1460
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:41,099
This. We're out here getting
attacked by this thing

1461
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:43,212
and it's all my fault that we're here.

1462
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:46,922
- Last night was scary, but
we're all okay, all right?

1463
01:04:47,873 --> 01:04:50,642
You did great yesterday.

1464
01:04:50,709 --> 01:04:52,852
Do you know how much discipline
it takes to stand all day

1465
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:56,442
holding a boom mic and
listening to Han Solo

1466
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:58,509
talk about a monster that doesn't exist.

1467
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:01,342
- But it does exist.

1468
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:02,912
- And I for one wish it did not,

1469
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:04,572
but that's beside the point, okay?

1470
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,502
The point is, you're good at this.

1471
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:11,529
And you're with us now.

1472
01:05:12,759 --> 01:05:13,525
Every single one of them

1473
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,642
is falling in love with you, you know.

1474
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:16,782
- It's hard to believe there's anything

1475
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:17,899
to fall in love with.

1476
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:22,262
- That's 'cause it's what you
were taught to think, babe.

1477
01:05:22,329 --> 01:05:25,029
Broken and powerless, like
we talked about last night.

1478
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:30,142
What they say you are and who you are,

1479
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:33,449
it's absolutely two
different things, I promise.

1480
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:38,222
- What did you do to get past it?

1481
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,493
- It's what I do every day.

1482
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:47,429
I don't let them win.

1483
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,312
I don't let other people's
judgment tear me to shreds.

1484
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:55,112
- How?

1485
01:05:57,472 --> 01:05:59,712
- You keep going.

1486
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,812
No matter what anybody says or thinks,

1487
01:06:03,879 --> 01:06:07,952
no matter what happens,
you just keep fighting,

1488
01:06:08,019 --> 01:06:10,722
even if the fight seems
completely pointless.

1489
01:06:11,563 --> 01:06:12,436
- You keep going.

1490
01:06:12,503 --> 01:06:13,336
- Yeah.

1491
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:16,659
You reach for that moon
if that's what you want.

1492
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:19,802
You stop carin' about what anybody

1493
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:21,819
thinks about you reachin' for it, okay.

1494
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:25,002
- Sounds easy enough.

1495
01:06:25,069 --> 01:06:26,729
- No, it's not.

1496
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:28,802
Sometimes it really sucks.

1497
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:33,142
It's worth it.

1498
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:35,952
You're worth it.

1499
01:06:40,589 --> 01:06:43,032
I'm just gonna keep saying
it till you believe me.

1500
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:45,597
- Okay.

1501
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:46,865
[Lois laughing]

1502
01:06:46,932 --> 01:06:47,765
- Come on.

1503
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:51,105
- I'm sorry.

1504
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:52,712
- Oh now, don't be sorry.

1505
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:55,502
Not about this stuff, okay?

1506
01:06:58,059 --> 01:06:59,202
- You want some of this?

1507
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:00,035
- Are you kidding?

1508
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:01,184
I hate those things.

1509
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:04,001
[Lois chuckling]

1510
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:10,882
- I think I found one of its lairs.

1511
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:12,262
- You're kidding.

1512
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,062
- No, it's back over the hill in a cave.

1513
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,612
I'm pretty sure it's the creature's lair.

1514
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:16,622
- How do you know?

1515
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,892
- There's prints all over it.

1516
01:07:19,959 --> 01:07:21,802
- Well, let's go see it.

1517
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:22,822
- Dallas.

1518
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:25,272
- Look, it's just over the hill.

1519
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:27,539
We'll check it out and
then we'll head back.

1520
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:29,865
- All right.

1521
01:07:29,932 --> 01:07:30,765
- [Dallas] Cool.

1522
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,806
[leaves and twigs crunching]

1523
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:43,373
[tense music]

1524
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:50,132
- See the tracks?

1525
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,012
- You think this thing lives here?

1526
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,184
- No, I think it lives
deeper in the woods.

1527
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:57,454
I think it uses this cave as
a camp when it comes in close.

1528
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:59,162
- Do you think it's in there?

1529
01:07:59,229 --> 01:08:01,422
- There's only one way
to find out, Dallas.

1530
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:04,212
- No way, I am not going in there.

1531
01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:07,602
- No. I mean, I love you guys, but no.

1532
01:08:07,669 --> 01:08:08,819
- I'll pass.
- Me too.

1533
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:14,062
- I would love to, but
I'm hugely claustrophobic.

1534
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:15,762
You guys would have to
carry me out of there.

1535
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:16,602
- I'll go.

1536
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:17,435
- [Roger] You sure?

1537
01:08:17,502 --> 01:08:18,432
- Hell yeah, you find anything,

1538
01:08:18,499 --> 01:08:19,942
I wanna shot at it before you do.

1539
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:20,859
- Okay, let's go.

1540
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:23,742
- Wait, hold on.

1541
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:25,362
It is gonna take us a
while to get outta here.

1542
01:08:25,429 --> 01:08:28,132
We cannot spend more time here.

1543
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:29,102
- [Dallas] She's right.

1544
01:08:29,169 --> 01:08:30,102
- [Roger] Okay, I agree.

1545
01:08:30,169 --> 01:08:31,459
- [Wes] Give us half hour.

1546
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:33,893
If we're not back out, y'all
go ahead and head back.

1547
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,062
- How the hell are we
supposed to find our way back?

1548
01:08:35,129 --> 01:08:36,763
- [Roger] Follow the flags, Chuck.

1549
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:39,352
[branch thuds]

1550
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:40,992
- I'm not comfortable with this.

1551
01:08:41,059 --> 01:08:41,825
- Half hour, Dallas.

1552
01:08:41,892 --> 01:08:43,209
I promise you, we'll be back.

1553
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,185
- Okay, half an hour.

1554
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:51,252
- [Roger] Okay.

1555
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:55,472
- 30 minutes guys, 30 minutes.

1556
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:57,622
- All right, 30 minutes Dallas, I promise.

1557
01:08:57,689 --> 01:08:58,455
- [Dallas] All right.

1558
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:00,212
- Stay behind me and do as I say.

1559
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,229
- [Wes] No problem.

1560
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:04,999
[anxious music]

1561
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:15,492
- Flashlight.

1562
01:09:15,559 --> 01:09:17,574
Keep it in front of us as best as you can.

1563
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:18,641
- All right.

1564
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,940
[twigs snapping]

1565
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,542
- Guys, I feel like this is a big mistake.

1566
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:31,482
We should not have let them go in there.

1567
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:32,752
- Probably right, but
there's nothing we can do

1568
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:33,952
until they come back outta there.

1569
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:36,572
- Roger is good, they'll be fine.

1570
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,962
- You can't say that.

1571
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:40,252
If that thing is in there,
then they just walked

1572
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,302
into the den of an eight-foot monster.

1573
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,500
[twigs snapping]

1574
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:15,701
[anxious music crescendos]

1575
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:27,392
- You really think that thing is in there?

1576
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:28,522
- Honestly?

1577
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:32,042
No, but at this point I want

1578
01:10:32,109 --> 01:10:34,682
whatever is in there to be far off.

1579
01:10:34,749 --> 01:10:36,772
Just a glimpse in the distance

1580
01:10:36,839 --> 01:10:38,412
so Wes can get his prize shot.

1581
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:39,312
- Yeah.

1582
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:46,878
You know, I joked with
you a lot about this.

1583
01:10:46,945 --> 01:10:48,492
You know, I was joking, bullshitting.

1584
01:10:48,559 --> 01:10:51,482
I just, I didn't know and I'm sorry.

1585
01:10:51,549 --> 01:10:53,352
- Come on, no one could have known.

1586
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:55,982
- You know, we always talk about

1587
01:10:56,049 --> 01:10:57,699
how every day we shoot
is Christmas Day, right?

1588
01:10:57,766 --> 01:10:58,532
- Yeah.

1589
01:10:58,599 --> 01:10:59,532
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it is.

1590
01:10:59,599 --> 01:11:01,272
- Let me tell you something.

1591
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:02,912
I mean this too, after last night,

1592
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:06,092
after everything today, if
we get outta this thing,

1593
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:07,969
I'm starting to feel like every day

1594
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:09,772
is gonna be Christmas Day from now on.

1595
01:11:11,509 --> 01:11:12,902
- You're scared.

1596
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:13,882
- Yeah.

1597
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:16,292
- But we've been through
bad situations before.

1598
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:17,962
The lions, Kenya.

1599
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:18,795
- Kenya?

1600
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:23,422
Dallas in Kenya, Kenya, we
knew where the lions were.

1601
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:24,432
Man, we knew.

1602
01:11:24,499 --> 01:11:26,002
They saw us, we could see them.

1603
01:11:26,069 --> 01:11:27,689
There was a, there was
a, what do you call it?

1604
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:29,352
A respect.

1605
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:30,562
There was a healthy respect going on.

1606
01:11:30,629 --> 01:11:32,852
There's no respect here at all, all right.

1607
01:11:32,919 --> 01:11:34,222
We're stomping through the woods.

1608
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,652
We don't know what we're looking for.

1609
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:37,222
We have no idea what's going on.

1610
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:39,782
It feels like we're outta control in here.

1611
01:11:39,849 --> 01:11:40,711
- Why?

1612
01:11:40,778 --> 01:11:41,872
Because we're making a
documentary about a cre-

1613
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:43,449
- Dallas, we're not making-

1614
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:46,042
We're not making a documentary anymore.

1615
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:46,912
Look at us.

1616
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:48,492
We're tromping through
the woods with a guy

1617
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,452
who looks like he's trying
to hunt a Velociraptor.

1618
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,442
Wes is pissin' on all the trees.

1619
01:11:54,749 --> 01:11:55,732
Lois has had it, all right.

1620
01:11:55,799 --> 01:11:57,252
She's too tough to admit it.

1621
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:59,232
Liz is scared shitless.

1622
01:11:59,299 --> 01:12:00,182
I'm scared.

1623
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:02,134
Silvia's...

1624
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:04,522
Silvia's being Silvia.

1625
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,912
Listen, we don't know
what's going on in there.

1626
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:09,782
We don't know anything about this thing

1627
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:12,412
and we're chasing after
it like we know something.

1628
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:13,752
We don't know anything here.

1629
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:16,542
It feels like, it feels
like we have no control.

1630
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:18,842
It doesn't feel like we're on
an adventure anymore at all.

1631
01:12:18,909 --> 01:12:20,702
- Chuck, you're wrong.

1632
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,342
It's exactly the way it feels to me.

1633
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:25,302
We're out here doing it.

1634
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:29,022
There's nobody else I'd
rather be doing this with.

1635
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:34,334
- All right, all right.

1636
01:12:36,343 --> 01:12:37,262
Well then let's do this

1637
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:38,565
and let's get the hell
outta here, you know?

1638
01:12:38,632 --> 01:12:40,532
- Okay, all right.
- All right.

1639
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,609
- Merry Christmas, man, you know?

1640
01:12:45,676 --> 01:12:47,759
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

1641
01:12:53,809 --> 01:12:54,859
- Shine it over here.

1642
01:13:02,636 --> 01:13:03,509
That's our boy.

1643
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:05,672
- All right, awesome.

1644
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,952
- So now that we're
about ready to head back,

1645
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:12,932
what are your thoughts on the weekend?

1646
01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:16,452
- Well, it was truly awesome.

1647
01:13:16,519 --> 01:13:19,952
We, the townspeople interviews were great.

1648
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,102
People were interesting.

1649
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:25,362
Friday night, we got video
proof of the creature.

1650
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:27,702
Whether anybody believes
it or not, doesn't matter.

1651
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:29,872
We know what happened and what we saw.

1652
01:13:32,069 --> 01:13:34,072
Today, we've done a fun little hike

1653
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:36,502
with Roger doing the tracking thing.

1654
01:13:36,569 --> 01:13:39,932
And I didn't ever expect
to see the creature,

1655
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,182
but after last night it went
well beyond my expectations.

1656
01:13:43,249 --> 01:13:45,632
- Dallas, it's been 30 minutes.

1657
01:13:45,699 --> 01:13:47,492
- Let's call for 'em.

1658
01:13:47,559 --> 01:13:48,892
Hey, if it's any consolation,

1659
01:13:48,959 --> 01:13:51,142
I haven't heard any blood
curdling screams yet.

1660
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:52,042
- True.

1661
01:13:57,315 --> 01:14:00,065
[twigs snapping]

1662
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:04,911
- You miss us?

1663
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:06,112
[Dallas shouting]

1664
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,442
- I was just getting ready to call you.

1665
01:14:08,509 --> 01:14:10,198
- I told you 30 minutes, Dallas.

1666
01:14:10,265 --> 01:14:11,910
It's okay, come on.

1667
01:14:11,977 --> 01:14:14,310
I got something to show you.

1668
01:14:21,376 --> 01:14:22,972
- Did you find anything?

1669
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:24,310
- This.

1670
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,278
- Ew.

1671
01:14:25,345 --> 01:14:26,452
- And some gnawed on animal bones.

1672
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:28,102
- [Dallas] So it does eat meat.

1673
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:30,442
- It was here, just not
here at the moment, Dallas.

1674
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:31,702
- Great. So can we go now?

1675
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:33,322
- Um, not just yet.

1676
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:34,155
- What now?

1677
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:34,988
- I've gotta pee.

1678
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:36,808
I'll just take a second, okay?

1679
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:37,641
- [Chuck] Be careful.

1680
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:38,762
- Couldn't you have done
that when you were waiting?

1681
01:14:38,829 --> 01:14:40,252
- I didn't know I had to go then.

1682
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,619
I'm an old woman, I don't
get advanced notice.

1683
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:46,282
- You know, just take your time.

1684
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:47,812
We got all day.

1685
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:49,312
- Tryin' to balance here.

1686
01:14:54,321 --> 01:14:56,963
[leaves rustling]

1687
01:14:57,030 --> 01:15:00,043
[tense music]

1688
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:02,237
Does anybody else need to
pee while we're waitin'?

1689
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,553
- I'm good.

1690
01:15:06,452 --> 01:15:09,452
[creature gurgling]

1691
01:15:14,652 --> 01:15:15,418
- All right.

1692
01:15:15,485 --> 01:15:18,068
[loud slicing]

1693
01:15:25,636 --> 01:15:28,386
[Lois screaming]

1694
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:32,723
- Lois! Lois!

1695
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,786
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

1696
01:15:35,853 --> 01:15:37,986
It's okay, you're okay.
- Chuck, Chuck.

1697
01:15:38,053 --> 01:15:38,976
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

1698
01:15:39,043 --> 01:15:40,317
Shh, shh, shh.
- Oh God, Chuck.

1699
01:15:40,384 --> 01:15:41,150
- You're okay.

1700
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:42,306
- [Roger] These wound are really bad.

1701
01:15:42,373 --> 01:15:43,139
- Why did it come after her?

1702
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,093
It must be defendin' its
territory where she took a piss.

1703
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,926
- Took a piss?

1704
01:15:45,993 --> 01:15:46,759
We've been pissin' in
these woods for two hours.

1705
01:15:46,826 --> 01:15:48,223
- You're not in his territory, Chuck.

1706
01:15:50,385 --> 01:15:51,218
- I told you.

1707
01:15:52,144 --> 01:15:53,325
We should've had vodka.

1708
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:55,094
- Vodka? Yes baby, I know.

1709
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:56,723
It's okay, you're all right.

1710
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,359
No, no, no, no.

1711
01:15:58,426 --> 01:16:01,568
No honey, it's okay, it's okay.

1712
01:16:01,635 --> 01:16:03,439
No, no, no, you're okay,
we're gettin' outta here.

1713
01:16:03,506 --> 01:16:04,333
- [Lois] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1714
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,682
Take care of Liz.

1715
01:16:05,749 --> 01:16:06,515
- Liz?

1716
01:16:06,582 --> 01:16:07,348
- She needs family.

1717
01:16:07,415 --> 01:16:10,103
- We're all right here,
she needs you baby.

1718
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,540
It's okay, we're gonna
get you out of here.

1719
01:16:11,607 --> 01:16:12,373
We're coming.

1720
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,206
No, no, no.

1721
01:16:13,273 --> 01:16:15,203
Lois, baby, baby, Lois.

1722
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,036
No, no, no, honey.

1723
01:16:16,103 --> 01:16:16,869
- [Roger] Chuck, she's gone.

1724
01:16:16,936 --> 01:16:17,774
- No, no, no, no, no.

1725
01:16:17,841 --> 01:16:18,607
- [Roger] She's gone, Chuck.

1726
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,440
- No, no, no.

1727
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:20,413
- It's over here.

1728
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,246
- [Roger] Chuck, we gotta go.

1729
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:22,838
- Oh God, no.
- Chuck, we gotta go.

1730
01:16:22,905 --> 01:16:25,463
- Dammit, no, goddammit.

1731
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:29,297
[Silvia gasps]

1732
01:16:29,364 --> 01:16:30,130
- Where's Lois?

1733
01:16:30,197 --> 01:16:30,963
- Lois is dead.

1734
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,796
- No!

1735
01:16:31,863 --> 01:16:32,843
[Silvia weeping]

1736
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,743
- Fuck.

1737
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,447
- Roger, shit, do something.

1738
01:16:36,514 --> 01:16:38,176
- Shoot it, shoot it.

1739
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:39,993
- [Roger] I can't get a clear shot.

1740
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:45,698
- [Dallas] Shit.

1741
01:16:45,765 --> 01:16:48,265
[scary music]

1742
01:16:56,474 --> 01:17:01,474
[leaves crunching]
[gun clicking]

1743
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,686
[creature growling]

1744
01:17:27,753 --> 01:17:28,725
[loud gunshot]

1745
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:31,144
[creature grunts]

1746
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:36,211
- I got the fuckin'
thing, it's over there.

1747
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,104
Shit.

1748
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:46,921

01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,953
It ripped her face off.

1886
01:27:39,001 --> 01:27:41,214
- He killed Roger.

1887
01:27:41,281 --> 01:27:42,543
We, we just started running.

1888
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:44,483
We've been running for hours.

1889
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:47,453
He killed Chuck.

1905
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:30,832

- Wait, where are you going?

1911
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:54,182
