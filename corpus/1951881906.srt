for all alien races

Mission complete. Please advise.

41
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,320
Well done, cadets.
Your training progresses nicely.

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,520
Uh, Kat... Ah...

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
I mean... Ma'am?

44
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,360
I mean... Miss Manx?

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,800
We were all wondering...

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,960
We know there's A Squad Power
Rangers, and we're B Squad cadets...

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,640
Not that there's anything wrong
with being B Squad,

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,560
- or C Squad or D Squad...
- SYD: Let me translate.

I speak fluent Bridge.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,360
He wants to know
when we're getting designer suits.

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,520
Kat, I've told them, it's not about
the suits or the weapons.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,440
It's about helping people

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,440
and upholding the tradition
of being a Power Ranger.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,440
That's up to Commander Cruger.

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
Not me.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760

Best cadets ever, Kat.

61
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
Agreed.

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
And you, Boom, my eager assistant,

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,920
job well done.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,800
- Get those charts.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Right here. Great.

we have a problem in the...

Ninth Quadrant. I am aware.

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,040
Nelandia has been destroyed.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,360
There is not a lot of time
and much to be done.

71
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,200
He is coming.

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,920
Beware, Earth.

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,280
Your end has begun.

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
- Boom, did we do that?
- No.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
You guys just dislocated my shoulder.

77
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,160
I popped it back in,
and it's good as gold. See? Ahh!

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Anyway,
this is Kat's new arm cast laser.

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
Cool, huh?

80
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Anyway, I got to go, so bye.

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,960
Aah! Ah!

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,440
- ( Crashing )
- Oh!

83
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,560
Boom! Clean up your mess.

84
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Yes, sir. Sir... which mess?

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,280
Start with the last one you made
and work backwards.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,040
Yes, sir.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
Lighten up, Sky.

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
Boom's a great guy.

89
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,600
A little weird, but a great guy.

90
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
Yeah, well, some day our lives
may depend on that great guy,

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,520
and then what?

92
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,920
I know. I know.

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,640
Then our lives will depend on him.

94
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,040
Commander Cruger wants to see us. Now!

95
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,440
CRUGER: Listen carefully, A Squad.

96
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,200
Preparation is the key
to any tactical defence.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Report to Delta Air Base
for last-minute simulation instruction.

98
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,760
- Earth depends on you. Dismissed.
- ALL: Yes, sir!

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
CRUGER: Good luck, A Squad.

100
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,840

101
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,160
Attention!

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,120
Ahh!

103

SKY: That is who I want to be.

104
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm gonna be the Red Ranger.

105
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,560
Jeez, did you see the size of them?

106
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,960
Even the girls are massive.

107
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
What's wrong, Bridge?

108
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,720
I don't know.

109
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,320
Their energy, their colours...
something's off.

110
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Cadets, I trust you've enjoyed
your training here at S.P.D. Academy.

111
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Fluorescent lighting
gives me a bit of a headache...

112
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
( Growls )

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,000
CRUGER: Not that your training's ended,
or will it ever and while you're here,

115
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,320
but as your commander,
I must now call opon B Squad

116
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,160
to step up
and take on new responsibilities.

117
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
Yes!

118
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,360
I thought new responsibilities meant
kicking intergalactic freakazoid butt.

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
The data device says to
bring in Parkington Market thieves.

120
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
It's code, no doubt.

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
What do you think it means?

122
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,920
Bring in the Parkington Market thieves.

123
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
You know, Sky, you are good.

124
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,120
MAN: Stop, thieves!

125
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,480
Out of the way.
We don't want to hurt you.

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,440
- Hurt us? That's a good one.
- ( Groaning )

127
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,360
- S.P.D. We'll take it from here.
- Thank you.

128
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,480
You may not be coming in peacefully,
but you're coming in.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,320
- What about me?
- Huh? Yah!

130
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,760
It's a hologram. It's not real.

131
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,600
Ah! Uh! OK, she's real.

132
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,040
Ha-ha.

133
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,800
Let's get 'em.

134
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
Got ya!

135
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,080
Aaah!

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,960
Huh?

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,480
There you are!

138
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,080
SKY: We got him.

139
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,800
Say good night, friend.

140
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
BOTH: Whoa!

141
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,160
( All Groaning )

142
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm sorry we can't stay and play,
but we got to run. ( Laughs )

143
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,640
That went well.

144
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,960
CRUGER: You underestimated your
opponent and were soundly defeated.

145
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,880
We are so not ready to be Rangers.

146
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
I'm ready.

147
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
So it must have been Syd and I
who let those two get away then.

148
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
CRUGER: Listen to yourselves.
There is no team here.

149
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,120
This is the issue you have to overcome
before you can become a Power Ranger.

150
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,640
Oh, I get it, we have to stop blaming,
criticising and judging each other?

151
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,560
- Forgot failing to bring in suspects.
- Right.

152
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,040
Let's see, that puts us right
on schedule to be Rangers around...

153
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,960
...never!

154
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
You will meet those two again.

155
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
Sir, the civilians, they were different.
They had special abilities like we do.

156
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,560
Yes, I know.

157
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,960
Cadet Tate, come with me.

158
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,760
Jack...

160
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,520
We've been on the streets
a long time together.

161
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
You're my best friend.

162
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,840
You're like my brother.

163
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,720
And, brother,
after five years of doing this,

164
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,520
I say we change careers.

165
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,560
I'm tired of playing Robin Hood.

166
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,120
( Cooing )

167
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,080
Oh, ah... I'm sorry.

168
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,000
We don't have anything else
to give out. Maybe tomorrow.

169
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,640
( Sighing )

170
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,360
Wait! Wait.

171
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,520
Oh! ( Cooing )

172
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,640
What? She needed it.

173
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,040
Maybe her husband did. Or her child.

174
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,320
OK. OK, you're right.
We got to do something else.

175
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,560
- OK.
- But after we do one more job.

176
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,040
Jack, do you think
some more food and some clothes

177
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,480
are gonna make a difference?

178
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,000
If we're gonna make a change, we
have to be part of something bigger.

179
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Yeah, well, when you find
something bigger, let me know.

180
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,480
- Why Red Ranger, cadet?
- Lots of reasons, sir.

181
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,880
I'm top on B Squad in test scores,
weaponry and in fighting.

182
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,680
As you know, sir,
my father was the Red Ranger.

183
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,080
Ever since I was a kid,
I've trained for the day

184
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,320
I become like my dad...
the next Red Ranger.

185
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
Your father was the best
of the best of Rangers.

186
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,880
If you're anything like him,
we will all benefit by your service.

187
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,080
- Dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

188
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
Cadet, if I was
to appoint Syd as Red Ranger,

189
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,640
would you follow her into battle?

190
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,360
Sir, she's a girl.

191
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
Or Bridge?

192
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
I like Bridge, but in all honesty,
sir, he's not a leader.

193
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
I see.

194
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
Thank you for your honesty, cadet.
That will be all.

195
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
Sir.

196
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,600
Hmm.

197
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,960
MAN: A Sirian space web.

198
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,880
Anubis Doggie Cruger is still alive.

199
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
The web is strong.

200
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,600
I need a Proton Accelerator
to move my ship through it.

201
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,400
I have a contact on the Earth planet
who will be able to get me one.

202
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
My ship may not
be able to get through now,

203
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,920
but a robot can.

204
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,040
Get me what I ask,
and let no one stop you.

205
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
Yes, master.

206
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,200
I told you this would be a great score.

207
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
Good work, Z.

208
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,960
Good work, Z.

209
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Good work, Z.

210
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,560
You know, Z, if we put
all of yourselves together,

211
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
we could get unlimited amounts
of food and clothes...

212
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,800
No, Jack! This is my last job
for me and all myselves,

213
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,440
or we're packing up
and doing it alone. You got it?

214
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,360
MAN: Help me!

215
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,720
Take this! And don't let them have it!

216
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,320
The future of the planet
depends on it! Hide it!

217
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,000
Ah... Ohh!

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,400
( Screaming )

219
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,840
( Both Laughing )

220
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,120
Why do the nuts of the world
always seem to find you?

221
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,960
Just lucky, I guess.

222
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes!

223
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,120
Fifty-five times in a row! ( Cheering )

224
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,080
OK, enough!

225
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm officially bored to tears.

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,360
We get called to report
an hour ago, to who?

227
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,240
- Whom?
- Never correct me again!

228
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,120
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm just tense watching Walk-a-thon
Boy wear a path in the floor.

230
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,120
If you have a problem with it,
Sydney, make me stop.

231
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,720
OK. I may be a girl
and I may be cute, but no one...

232
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,920
I trust you're using this time
to bond as a team?

233
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,480
- ALL: Yes, sir!
- Good. Come this way.

234
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,120
Without going into details,
Earth's survival dictates

235
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,960
that I elevate your team
to active status. Any questions?

236
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,280
Um... Yeah, just one.

237
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,160
Did you say ultimate survival,

238
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,360
as in, Earth may be destroyed?

239
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,280
I did.

240
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,520
Cadets, you have spent the last
two years in simulated training.

241
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
But this time, the game is real.

242
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,400
S.P.D. morphers.

243
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
They are, without a doubt,
your best friend.

244
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,760
They are also judgement scanners.

245
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,160
They will assess
the guilt or innocence

246
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,080
of those you take into custody.

247
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,000
Boom,

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,320
guilty or innocent of eating
the last slice of cake today?

249
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,400
BOOM: Me? I...

250
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
I... ( Giggling )

251
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,960
No. No, no, I didn't.

252
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,720
The scanner reads body temperature,
pulse and electrical impulses,

253
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
then renders a verdict. Guilty.

254
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,040
- But...
- KAT: And it does not make mistakes.

255
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,400
OK. I'm guilty.

256
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,480
But it was a just a piece of cake!

257
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,000
BOOM: OK. Time to let Boom out now.

258
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,520
This makes transportation
of the detainee a non-issue.

259
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,960
- BOOM: Kat?
- You are trained and now equipped.

260
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
You are the new B Squad Power
Rangers. Congratulations.

261
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,000
- Yes!
- Celebration can come later.

262
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,920
I need immediate assistance
on an urgent matter.

263
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,840
- ALL: Yes, sir.
- Follow me.

264
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,640
BOOM: Hello? Kat! Hello?

265
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,280
I will never eat chocolate cake again!

266
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
CRUGER: Coordinates
of the street thieves' location

267
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,040
is locked into
your vehicle's computers.

268
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
( Siren Sounding )

269
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,240
- Thank you.
- This is all that's left.

270
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,520
If you can't eat it or wear it,
it has no value.

271
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,560
Ha!

272
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,320
Did you see how much those people
appreciated what we gave them?

273
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Yeah. Kind of gave me that warm
and fuzzy feeling that I hate so much.

274
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,080
And no, I didn't change my mind
about wanting to do something bigger.

275
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
Nice to see you two again.

276
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,840
I told you we should have quit
while we were ahead.

277
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,640
Don't worry. I'll take care of this,
and we'll be on our way.

278
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,520
Jack!

279
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,160
Guess what?
You're not the only one with tricks.

280
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,560
- Jack, let's get out of here.
- Can't do that.

281
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,360
We need to finish this here and now,
or these clowns will bug us forever.

282
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
Listen, I think we should go about this

283
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,440
in the smoothest
and most repectful way,

284
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,680
each valuing each others'
humanity and dignity and...

285
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,480
Or not.

286
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
Hiya!

287
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
( Grunting, Panting )

288
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,160
We're not doing as well as before, bro.
Any suggestions?

289
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
Run?

290
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
Huh?

291
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,080
You're accused of stealing
and distributing stolen goods.

292
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,320
- Can you prove it?
- Actually, yes, we can.

293
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,760
- BRIDGE: Guilty.
- Any chance of going two out of three?

294
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,360
Didn't think so.

295
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,640
- Wait!
- What is it?

296
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,520
- What are you gonna do with us?
- It's quite fascinating.

297
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,080
We're going to blast you
with anti-matter fusion

298
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,120
which reduces you to
approximately this big and this thin.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Simultaneously, you're inserted
into a confinement card

300
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,520
where you're shipped off
for filing until... your time is served.

301
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,640
You had to ask, Z.

302
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,080
You do the crime, you pay the time.

303
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,520
- I always wanted to say that.
- Enough with the small talk.

304
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
( Gasps )

305
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
( Growls )

306
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,240
- Huh?
- ( Robotic Whirring )

307
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,040
That's OK.
A few extra friends won't bother us.

308
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,120
Hate to break it to you,
but these aren't our friends.

309
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,040
So with our deepest apologies,

310
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,640
we'll take this opportunity
to be on our way.

311
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,480
Good luck. Let's go, Z.

312
