01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,685
-Well, what are we gonna do once we get there?

901
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,520
-Relax, all right?

902
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,487
We're fine.

903
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,890
-Maybe we should have just lasted it out.

904
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,224
We only had another month.

905
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:42,792
-No.

906
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:43,793
No way.

907
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:44,493
No.

908
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,694
-Well, what do you mean no way?

909
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,430
-Strut, tell her.

910
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,864
-I overheard Night Eagle and Running Doe,

911
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,833
and our stay has definitely been extended.

912
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:51,634
Definitely.

913
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:02,478
-We think we may have had a couple runaways down here.

914
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,246
-They must be the ones who stole the boat.

915
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,581
They're headed around the bend right there.

916
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,283
-I gotta get to them before they hit white water.

917
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,485
I need to borrow your boat.

918
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,886
They don't know a thing about white water.

919
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,456
-Night Eagle, come on!

920
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,423
-Hey, what about my boat?

921
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,525
-Uh, uh-- thanks a lot.

922
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,442
-You must like it here.

923
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,512
It's like you're begging to stay on.

924
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:37,613
-Sorry, sir.

925
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:40,950
I'm just-- just worried about my fellow students.

926
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,819
-All three of them?

927
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,621
-Yeah.

928
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,589
-Put on that life jacket.

929
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,423
Hand me one.

930
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,772
-Got something here.

931
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,774
-Got it.

932
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,809
Hang on.

933
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,349
See them yet?

934
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:16,352
-I don't see them, no.

935
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,387
-Need to-- need to put on a life vest.

936
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,358
-There they are!

937
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,717
-Joey, when we catch up to Webber,

938
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,553
you might have to take charge of the boat.

939
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:51,353
-All right.

940
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,865
-Well, if we can hang in there just a little longer, just

941
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,301
after this next bend, there's only one more set of rapids.

942
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,279
-Hold on.

943
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:17,880
-Hang on.

944
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:18,681
Hold it!

945
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,481
Hold it!

946
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:30,659
-Take this, and call Running Doe.

947
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,494
Get to shore when you catch up with the boat.

948
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,062
-All right.

949
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:33,862
-Take it.

950
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,001
-All right.

951
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,103
I think we got it made.

952
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,105
-We got it made?

953
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,773
What about Strut?

954
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:21,910
-He's got to take care of himself, OK?

955
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,047
That's just the way it goes.

956
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,982
Chelsea, what are you doing?

957
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:30,753
-You may not care about Strut, but I do.

958
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:31,920
-All right, then go.

959
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:32,821
You go, all right?

960
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,023
I don't need you in this boat.

961
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,125
You're doing me a big favor here.

962
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,693
CHELSEA: Thank you.

963
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,728
-You belong with those losers anyway.

964
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,092
JOEY: Chelsea, hang on!

965
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,925
JOEY (VOICEOVER): Everyone finished their vision quest

966
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:53,662
except for Chelsea, Webber, Strut, and me.

967
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,265
Night Eagle has given Chelsea and me extra assignments

968
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:59,468
to make up for our little river adventure.

969
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,060
Webber is still missing, but they

970
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:26,094
found the boat on the shore.

971
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,262
So he must be OK.

972
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,670
As for Strut, he was gonna be sent home.

973
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,840
And I don't believe it, but apparently he begged to stay on

974
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,174
and even agreed to do an extra month.

975
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:51,820
-After the storm comes the rainbow.

976
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:55,123
It brings with it fresh new life.

977
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:58,894
Many flowers and blossoms spring forth from the hard rocky soil.

978
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:03,632
And though the landscape seems barren and hopeless,

979
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:07,002
the most beautiful flowers make their appearance.

980
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:10,606
Minnie, you are one of those flowers.

981
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,975
I give you the name Rainbow Blossom.

982
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,218
-Until we are strong enough to survive on our own,

983
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,622
we are dependent upon those who care for us.

984
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,590
So it is with the hawk.

985
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,925
You are agile.

986
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,927
You are swift.

987
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,062
I give you the name of Swift Hawk.

988
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,836
-From a glowing ember we make a fire--

989
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,006
a fire that gives us warmth and gives

990
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,708
light to a world of darkness.

991
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:51,079
From something small many things are possible.

992
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,115
I give you the name Fire Fox.

993
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:01,256
-You have come to realize many God-given talents,

994
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,225
and you have determined to develop them.

995
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,828
In planning for your future, you not only hunger

996
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:10,332
for good, nourishing food, you also

997
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,902
hunger for knowledge and truth.

998
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,605
Therefore, I give you the name of Hungry Bear.

999
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:36,024
The raven is known for its cunning, wisdom, and magic.

1000
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,161
She's special, and she's powerful.

1001
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:42,397
She's not as swift as the hawk or as strong as the bear,

1002
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,768
but in what others may perceive as her weakness lies

1003
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:48,704
her strength.

1004
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,173
I give you the name of Night Raven.

1005
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:01,717
-A young swan is awkward and gangly.

1006
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,687
But as it grows, it becomes graceful and beautiful.

1007
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:08,991
Its spirit dances on the water.

1008
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:13,862
When it takes to its wings, it rises above the earth.

1009
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,364
I'll call you Rising Swan.

1010
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,940
-Being willing to risk your life for someone else

1011
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:26,842
is the noblest of gestures.

1012
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,877
And having the determination and skill

1013
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,913
is fortunate for Rising Swan.

1014
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,216
I give you the name Brave Otter.

1015
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,923
Grey Wolf is here to prepare you to return to your families.

1016
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:51,900
-Well, congratulations again.

1017
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:55,971
You have realized your vision quest.

1018
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:59,241
You've become self sufficient.

1019
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:03,412
And you've seen yourself face to face.

1020
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:07,249
I only hope that you like what you see.

1021
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,672
JOEY (VOICEOVER): Night Eagle told us

1022
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:34,176
about some ancient prophet guy who said that the race doesn't

1023
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:38,180
go to the fast ones but to those who endure to the end.

1024
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,981
We awakened at sunrise and were told

1025
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,818
that we were to run eight miles through the mountains

1026
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,821
and that if we made it, we were ready to start our new lives.

1027
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,511
-Why did you put me in here though?

1028
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,579
Why did you put me in here?

1029
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,128
-I'm sorry.

1030
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,097
I kicked him out.

1031
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,131
I'm sorry.

1032
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,043
-Look at you.

1033
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,478
Just look at you!

1034
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:40,755
[SOBBING]

1035
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,170
-I didn't think you were gonna show.

1036
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,572
-Are you kidding me?

1037
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,140
We wouldn't miss this for the world.

1038
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,278
-I think I'm ready to come home now.
