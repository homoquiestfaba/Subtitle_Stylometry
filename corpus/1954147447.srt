1
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,571
<i>ALL. Born of cold and winter air</i>

2
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,805
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

3
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,084
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

4
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:08,485
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

5
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,490
<i>So cut through the heart</i>

6
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,972
<i>Cold and clear</i>

7
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,011
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

8
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:17,892
<i>See the beauty sharp and sheer</i>

9
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:20,886
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

10
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,841
<i>And break the frozen heart
Hup, ho</i>

11
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:27,289
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

12
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,769
<i>Hup, ho</i>

13
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,562
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

14
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:33,922
<i>Beautiful
Powerful</i>

15
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,287
<i>Dangerous
Cold</i>

16
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:37,602
<i>Ice has a magic
Can't be controlled</i>

17
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:38,842
<i>Stronger than one</i>

18
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,082
<i>Stronger than ten</i>

19
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,966
<i>Stronger than a hundred men!</i>

20
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,327
om

21
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,768
<i>Born of cold
And winter air</i>

22
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,082
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

23
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,482
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

24
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,246
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

25
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:56,647
<i>Cut through the heart</i>

26
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,847
<i>Cold and clear</i>

27
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:00,083
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

28
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,603
<i>There's beauty and there's danger here</i>

29
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,923
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

30
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:09,211
<i>Beware the frozen heart</i>

31
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,928
Come on, Sven.

32
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,486
Elsa. Psst!

33
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,366
Elsa!

34
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,689
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

35
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:52,322
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,809
I just can't.

37
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,926
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

38
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,130
So, we have to play.

39
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,124
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:11,249
Do you want to build a snowman?

41
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:13,928
Come on, come on, come on!

42
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,850
Do the magic!

43
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,487
Oh...

44
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,930
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

45
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,130
This is amazing!

46
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,212
Watch this!

47
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,086
Hi, I'm Olaf,

48
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,765
and I like warm hugs.

49
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,445
I love you, Olaf!

50
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,885
Olaf...

51
00:04:58,401 --> 00:04:59,402
Tickle bumps!

52
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,847
Oh!

53
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:04,562
Hang on!

54
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:05,962
Catch me!

55
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,008
Gotcha!

56
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,287
Again!

57
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,602
Wait!

58
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:11,488
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down!

59
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,768
Whoo!

60
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,047
Anna!

61
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,527
Anna!

62
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,044
Mama! Papa!

63
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,205
No, no...

64
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,286
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

65
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,847
Elsa, what have you done?

66
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,931
This is getting out of hand.

67
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,444
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna!

68
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,366
- Oh. She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

69
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:11,447
Ice?

70
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:16,046
Faster, Sven.

71
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,122
Sven!

72
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:24,083
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

73
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,528
It's the king.

74
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,330
- Trolls?
- Shush!

75
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,806
I'm trying to listen.

76
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,972
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

77
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,446
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,485
Born with the powers, or cursed?

79
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,002
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

80
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,532
Here, here.

81
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,365
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

82
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,731
The heart is not so easily changed.

83
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,527
But the head can be persuaded.

84
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:07,411
Do what you must.

85
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,087
I recommend we remove all magic.

86
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:13,843
Even memories of magic, to be safe.

87
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,810
But don't worry. I'll leave the fun.

88
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,212
She will be okay.

89
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,889
But she won't remember I have powers?

90
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,892
It's for the best.

91
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:34,285
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

92
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,922
There is beauty in it...

93
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,290
But also great danger.

94
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:43,682
You must learn to control it.

95
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,564
Fear will be your enemy.

96
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:50,562
No!

97
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,252
We'll protect her.

98
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,449
She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

99
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,046
<i>Until then...</i>

100
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,845
<i>We'll lock the gates.</i>

101
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,521
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

102
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,888
<i>We will limit her contact with people,</i>

103
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:06,045
<i>and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.</i>

104
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,171
<i>Including Anna.</i>

105
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,525
Ah.

106
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,367
Elsa?

107
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,846
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

108
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,648
<i>Come on, let's go and play</i>

109
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,604
<i>I never see you anymore</i>

110
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,047
<i>Come out the door</i>

111
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,807
<i>It's like you've gone away</i>

112
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:41,922
<i>We used to be best buddies
And now we're not</i>

113
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:46,002
<i>I wish you would tell me why</i>

114
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,967
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

115
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,892
<i>It doesn't
have to be a snowman</i>

116
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,611
Go away, Anna.

117
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:56,531
<i>Okay, bye</i>

118
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:03,892
The gloves will help.

119
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:06,290
See? Conceal it.

120
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:07,971
Don't feel it.

121
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,725
Don't let it show.

122
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,566
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

123
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:17,882
<i>Or ride our bike around the halls?</i>

124
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:21,083
<i>I think some company is overdue</i>

125
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,005
<i>I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls</i>

126
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:25,202
Hang in there, Joan.

127
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:28,763
<i>It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms</i>

128
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,692
<i>Just watching the hours tick by</i>

129
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,087
I'm scared.

130
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,162
It's getting stronger!

131
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:43,006
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.

132
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,810
No! Don't touch me!

133
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,009
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

134
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:56,685
See you in two weeks!

135
00:09:58,961 --> 00:09:59,962
Do you have to go?

136
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,370
You'll be fine, Elsa.

137
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,326
Your Highness.

138
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:42,642
Elsa?

139
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:45,888
<i>Please
I know you're in there</i>

140
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:49,448
<i>People are asking where you've been</i>

141
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:54,330
<i>They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to</i>

142
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,690
<i>I'm right out here for you</i>

143
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,008
<i>Just let me in</i>

144
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:04,051
<i>We only have each other
It's just you and me</i>

145
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:08,572
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

146
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:15,241
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

147
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,211
All ashore!

148
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:52,487
Welcome to Arendelle!

149
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,161
Watch your step, please.

150
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,891
The gates will be opening soon.

151
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,844
Why do I have to wear this?

152
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:01,049
Because the queen has come of age.

153
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:02,925
It's Coronation Day!

154
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,810
That's not my fault.

155
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,244
What do you want, Sven?

156
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,561
"Give me a snack. "

157
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,245
What's the magic word?

158
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,322
"Please. "

159
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,290
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

160
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,963
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

161
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,682
And for a whole day!
Faster, Percy!

162
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:32,008
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

163
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,325
Open those gates so I may unlock

164
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,842
your secrets and exploit your riches.

165
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,727
Did I say that out loud?

166
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,611
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait

167
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,331
to see the queen and the princess.

168
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:44,489
I bet they are absolutely lovely.

169
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,683
I bet they are beautiful.

170
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,365
Princess Anna?

171
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,603
- Princess Anna?
- Huh? Yeah?

172
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:57,767
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

173
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,645
No, no, no, you didn't.

174
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,291
I've been up for hours.

175
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,967
Who is it?

176
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,805
Still me, ma'am.

177
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:11,646
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

178
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,763
Of course.

179
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,002
Ready for what?

180
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,561
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

181
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:19,962
My sister's corneration.

182
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,849
It's Coronation Day!

183
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,964
it's Coronation Day!

184
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:31,327
<i>The window is open!</i>

185
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:32,482
<i>So's that door!</i>

186
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,802
<i>I didn't know they did that anymore</i>

187
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:38,931
<i>Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?</i>

188
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:41,763
<i>For years I've roamed these empty halls</i>

189
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,363
<i>Why have a ballroom with no balls?</i>

190
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:48,766
<i>Finally
They're opening up the gates!</i>

191
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,727
<i>There'll be actual, real, live people</i>

192
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,724
<i>It'll be totally strange</i>

193
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:57,851
<i>But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!</i>

194
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:02,450
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

195
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,366
<i>There'll be music</i>

196
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:07,206
<i>There'll be light</i>

197
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,523
<i>For the first time</i>

198
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,603
<i>In forever</i>

199
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:16,649
<i>I'll be dancing through the night</i>

200
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,929
<i>Don't know if I'm elated or gassy</i>

201
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,766
<i>But I'm somewhere in that zone</i>

202
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:26,803
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

203
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,650
<i>I won't be alone</i>

204
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,611
I can't wait to meet everyone!

205
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,167
What if I meet The One?

206
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,241
<i>Tonight
Imagine me gown and all</i>

207
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,562
<i>Fetchingly draped against the wall</i>

208
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:45,965
<i>The picture of sophisticated grace</i>

209
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,568
<i>I suddenly see him standing there</i>

210
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,802
<i>A beautiful stranger</i>

211
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:50,882
<i>Tall and fair</i>

212
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:55,523
<i>I wanna stuff some chocolate
in my face!</i>

213
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:58,292
<i>But then we laugh and talk all evening</i>

214
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,568
<i>Which is totally bizarre</i>

215
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:04,646
<i>Nothing like the life
I've led so far</i>

216
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,006
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

217
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:13,684
<i>There'll be magic
There'll be fun</i>

218
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:18,165
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

219
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:22,884
<i>I could be noticed by someone</i>

220
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,568
<i>And I know it is totally crazy</i>

221
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,202
<i>To dream I'd find romance</i>

222
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,210
<i>But for the first time in forever</i>

223
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,288
<i>At least I've got a chance!</i>

224
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,770
<i>Don't let them in</i>

225
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,203
<i>Don't let them see</i>

226
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,092
<i>Be the good girl</i>

227
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:51,731
<i>You always have to be</i>

228
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:55,047
<i>Conceal</i>

229
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,052
<i>Don't feel</i>

230
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,244
<i>Put on a show</i>

231
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:01,047
<i>Make one wrong move</i>

232
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:03,692
<i>And everyone will know</i>

233
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,606
<i>But it's only for today</i>

234
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:07,648
<i>It's only for today</i>

235
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:10,486
<i>It's agony to wait</i>

236
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,492
<i>Tell the guards to open up</i>

237
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,602
<i>The gate</i>

238
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,729
<i>The gate</i>

239
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:22,170
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

240
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:23,527
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

241
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,242
<i>I'm getting what I'm dreaming of</i>

242
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:28,442
<i>Be the good girl</i>

243
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,727
<i>You always have to be</i>

244
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,172
<i>A chance to change</i>

245
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,005
<i>My lonely world</i>

246
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,321
Conceal

247
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:37,644
<i>A chance to find true love</i>

248
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,723
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

249
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,849
<i>I know it all ends tomorrow</i>

250
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,771
<i>So it has to be today!</i>

251
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:49,769
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

252
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,682
<i>For the first time</i>

253
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,163
<i>In forever</i>

254
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:01,126
<i>Nothing's in my way!</i>

255
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,042
Hey!

256
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,452
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

257
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,886
Hey.

258
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,884
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.

259
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:15,087
Are you sure?

260
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:17,846
Yeah.
I just wasn't looking where I was going.

261
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,003
But I'm great, actually.

262
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,290
Oh... Thank goodness.

263
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,281
Oh! Uh...

264
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,130
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

265
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,450
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

266
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,046
"Princess"? My Lady.

267
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,327
<i>"UN.</i>

268
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:36,205
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

269
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,646
- Um...
- Whew.

270
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,212
Hi. Again.

271
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:41,010
Oh, boy!

272
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,922
This is awkward.

273
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,645
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...

274
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,042
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

275
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:48,442
I'd like to formally apologize

276
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,728
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

277
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,131
And for every moment after.

278
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,646
No! No, no. It's fine.

279
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:56,007
I'm not that princess.

280
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,805
I mean, if you had hit my sister Elsa,

281
00:17:57,881 --> 00:17:59,645
it would be... Yeesh!

282
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,211
Because, you know...

283
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,487
Hello.

284
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,285
But, lucky you,

285
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,245
it's just me.

286
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,888
"Jus" you?

287
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,046
The bells. The coronation.

288
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,283
I better go.

289
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,932
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

290
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:23,602
Bye!

291
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,125
Oh, no. Oh!

292
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,603
Your Majesty, the gloves.

293
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,405
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

294
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,923
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

295
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:08,572
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

296
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:13,126
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

297
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,607
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

298
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,807
Because I don't think I'm supposed to...

299
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:22,121
Oh. Okay.

300
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,248
Hi.

301
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:34,245
"Hi" me? Oh...

302
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,131
Um... Hi.

303
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:39,287
You look beautiful.

304
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,409
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

305
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:42,971
I mean, not "fuller. " You don't look fuller.

306
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,088
But more beautiful.

307
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,970
Thank you.

308
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,327
So...

309
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,410
This is what a party looks like.

310
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,326
It's warmer than I thought.

311
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:55,529
What is that amazing smell?

312
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,527
Chocolate.

313
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:04,721
Your Majesty.

314
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:07,846
- The Duke of Weaseltown.
- "Weselton"!

315
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:09,845
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

316
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,604
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

317
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,807
that I offer you

318
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,451
your first dance as queen.

319
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,166
One-two, and jump.

320
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,682
Uh...

321
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,850
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

322
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,047
Oh...

323
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:28,168
But my sister does.

324
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,482
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.

325
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,648
Oh, I don't think...

326
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:33,928
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.

327
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:35,766
Sorry.

328
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,650
Like an agile peacock.

329
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:39,530
Ow! Ow.

330
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:42,565
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

331
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,723
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

332
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,652
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

333
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,450
- No.
- No.

334
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:50,892
All right. Hang on!

335
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,846
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper" for nothing!

336
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,002
Oh-ho!

337
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,528
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

338
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,641
Let me know when you're ready

339
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,802
for another round, Milady.

340
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,652
Well, he was sprightly.

341
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:07,965
Especially
for a man in heels.

342
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,651
Are you okay?

343
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:13,450
I've never been better. This is so nice.

344
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,923
I wish it could be like this all the time.

345
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:18,761
Me, too.

346
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:23,602
But it can't.

347
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,683
- Why not?
- It just can't.

348
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,571
Excuse me for a minute.

349
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,050
I'd be honored.

350
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:42,682
Glad I caught you.

351
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,127
Hans.

352
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,166
Oop.

353
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,603
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

354
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:58,604
- Oh!
- Oops

355
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:00,052
Sorry.

356
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:01,452
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.

357
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:02,807
Ah.

358
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,408
What's this?

359
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:09,892
Uh, I was born with it.

360
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,168
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

361
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:13,721
I like it.

362
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:15,405
Yeah, the whole thing.

363
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:16,562
You got it.

364
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:19,567
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?

365
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:21,690
Twelve older brothers.

366
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,089
Three of them pretended I was invisible,

367
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,324
literally, for two years.

368
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,647
That's horrible.

369
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:29,287
It's what brothers do.

370
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,012
And sisters.

371
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:33,642
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

372
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:37,123
But then, one day, she just shut me out,

373
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,522
and I never knew why.

374
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:42,126
I would never shut you out.

375
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,962
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

376
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:48,567
I love crazy.

377
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:53,450
<i>All my life has been
A series of doors in my face</i>

378
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:56,527
<i>And then suddenly
I bump into you</i>

379
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,888
I was thinking the same thing,
because,like.

380
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:01,043
<i>I've been searching my whole life</i>

381
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:03,010
<i>To find my own place</i>

382
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,762
<i>And maybe it's the party talking</i>

383
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:06,882
<i>Or the chocolate fondue</i>

384
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,008
<i>But with you</i>

385
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,243
<i>But with you I found my place</i>

386
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:12,971
<i>I see your face</i>

387
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,966
<i>And it's nothing like
I've ever known before</i>

388
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,008
<i>Love is an open</i>

389
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,210
<i>Door!</i>

390
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:22,972
<i>Love is an open</i>

391
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,170
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

392
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:28,648
<i>BOTH". Love is an open door</i>

393
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:31,406
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

394
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:34,246
<i>BOTH". Love is an open door</i>

395
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,042
<i>- I mean, it's crazy
- What?</i>

396
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,323
<i>- We finish each other's
Sandwiches</i>

397
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:46,687
That's what I was gonna say!

398
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,887
<i>I've never met someone</i>

399
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:49,963
<i>BOTH". Who thinks so much like me</i>

400
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,492
Jinx! Jinx again!

401
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:56,010
<i>Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation</i>

402
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:57,602
<i>- You
- And I</i>

403
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:58,682
<i>- Were
- Just</i>

404
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,251
<i>BOTH". Meant to be</i>

405
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,888
<i>- Say goodbye
- Say goodbye</i>

406
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,805
<i>BOTH". To the pain of the past</i>

407
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:09,450
<i>We don't have to feel it anymore</i>

408
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,647
<i>Love is an open door</i>

409
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,086
<i>Love is an open</i>

410
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:19,250
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

411
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,244
<i>BOTH". Life can be so much more</i>

412
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:24,245
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

413
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,607
<i>BOTH". Love is an open</i>

414
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:29,163
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

415
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,450
Can I say something crazy?

416
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,445
Will you marry me?

417
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,645
Can I say something even crazier?

418
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,202
Yes!

419
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,570
Coming through.
Excuse me. Oh...

420
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,486
Pardon. Sorry.
Oh!

421
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,086
Can we just get around you there?

422
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,245
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

423
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:49,562
Elsa!

424
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:52,326
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

425
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:56,088
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

426
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,971
Your Majesty.

427
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,682
We would like...

428
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:00,762
Uh, your blessing...

429
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,805
Of our marriage.

430
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,085
- Marriage?
- Yes!

431
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:07,767
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

432
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:10,082
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

433
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,004
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

434
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:14,322
Of course, we'll have soup, roast and ice
cream. And then...

435
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,562
Wait. Would we live here?

436
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,924
- Here?
- Absolutely!

437
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,002
- Anna!
- Oh!

438
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,571
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

439
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,887
What? No, no, no.

440
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:24,089
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.

441
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,245
No one's brothers are staying here.

442
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:27,686
No one is getting married.

443
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:29,447
Wait, what?

444
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,365
May I talk to you, please? Alone.

445
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,602
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

446
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:40,007
Fine.
You can't marry a man you just met.

447
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:42,170
You can if it's true love.

448
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:44,130
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

449
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:45,288
More than you.

450
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:47,125
All you know is how to shut people out.

451
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,972
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

452
00:26:52,481 --> 00:26:54,688
Now, excuse me.

453
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:56,371
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

454
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,523
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

455
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:00,726
The party is over. Close the gates.

456
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:01,842
Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?

457
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,411
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

458
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,602
Give me my glove!

459
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,531
Elsa, please, please.

460
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,405
I can't live like this anymore!

461
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:11,328
Then leave.

462
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,566
What did I ever do to you?

463
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,847
Enough, Anna.

464
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,969
No, why? Why do you shut me out?

465
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,686
Why do you shut the world out?

466
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:25,525
What are you so afraid of?

467
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,491
I said, enough!

468
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,007
Sorcery.

469
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:40,087
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

470
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,047
Elsa.

471
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:50,242
There she is!

472
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:58,288
Yes! It is her!

473
00:27:58,361 --> 00:27:59,487
Queen Elsa.

474
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,251
Our beautiful queen!

475
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,729
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

476
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,082
No.

477
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,047
There she is! Stop her!

478
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,409
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.

479
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:25,763
Monster. Monster!

480
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:29,202
{SHUDDERS)

481
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,807
Elsa!

482
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,725
Elsa!

483
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,081
Wait, please!

484
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,571
Elsa, stop!

485
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,802
Anna!

486
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,002
No.

487
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:12,967
The fjord.

488
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,725
- Snow!
- Snow?

489
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,128
Yes, snow.

490
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:36,965
- Are you all right?
- No.

491
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:38,566
Did you know?

492
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:40,288
No.

493
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,726
Look, it's snowing. It's snowing!

494
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:44,445
The queen has cursed this land!

495
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,723
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

496
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,041
Wait, no!

497
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:50,647
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

498
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:52,211
Are you a monster, too?

499
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:55,285
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

500
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,851
That's right, she is.

501
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,325
In the best way.

502
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:01,091
And my sister is not a monster.

503
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:02,731
She nearly killed me!

504
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,326
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.

505
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:06,642
It was an accident. She was scared.

506
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,692
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

507
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:12,522
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

508
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:13,927
So, I'm the one

509
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,247
- that needs to go after her.
- What?

510
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,642
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no.

511
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:18,927
It's too dangerous.

512
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:20,931
Elsa is not dangerous.

513
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,165
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

514
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,282
I'm coming with you.

515
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:27,570
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

516
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,566
On my honor.

517
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,246
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

518
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,926
Are you sure you can trust her?

519
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:38,972
I don't want you getting hurt.

520
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:40,602
She's my sister.

521
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:42,532
She would never hurt me.

522
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:26,884
<i>The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight</i>

523
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:29,965
<i>Not a footprint to be seen</i>

524
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,890
<i>A kingdom of isolation</i>

525
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,807
<i>And it looks like
I'm the queen</i>

526
00:31:38,361 --> 00:31:40,489
<i>The wind is howling</i>

527
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:44,282
<i>Like this swirling storm inside</i>

528
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:50,163
<i>Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried</i>

529
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:55,729
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

530
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:59,248
<i>Be the good girl
You always have to be</i>

531
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:04,043
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

532
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,490
<i>Well, now they know</i>

533
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:12,209
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

534
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,570
<i>Can't hold me back anymore</i>

535
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:19,050
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

536
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:22,604
<i>Turn away and slam the door</i>

537
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:25,808
<i>I don't care</i>

538
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:29,209
<i>What they're going to say</i>

539
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,249
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

540
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,532
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

541
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:46,844
<i>It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small</i>

542
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:50,884
<i>And the fears that once controlled me</i>

543
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,932
<i>Can't get to me at all</i>

544
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:58,883
<i>It's time to see what I can do</i>

545
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:02,408
<i>To test the limits and break through</i>

546
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:03,966
<i>No right, no wrong</i>

547
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,123
<i>No rules for me</i>

548
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,365
<i>I'm free!</i>

549
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:11,492
<i>Let it go!</i>

550
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:13,411
<i>Let it go!</i>

551
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:17,009
<i>I am one with the wind and sky</i>

552
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:20,403
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

553
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:24,129
<i>You'll never see me cry</i>

554
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:28,209
<i>Here I stand</i>

555
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,932
<i>And here I'll stay</i>

556
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:34,808
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

557
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,971
<i>My power flurries through the air</i>

558
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:49,204
<i>Into the ground</i>

559
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:54,243
<i>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals</i>

560
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:56,449
<i>All around</i>

561
00:33:56,841 --> 00:34:01,881
<i>And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast</i>

562
00:34:03,881 --> 00:34:06,487
<i>I'm never going back</i>

563
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:10,892
<i>The past is in the past</i>

564
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:14,485
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

565
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:18,489
<i>And I'll rise like the break of dawn</i>

566
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:21,810
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

567
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:26,002
<i>That perfect girl is gone</i>

568
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:28,647
<i>Here I stand</i>

569
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:32,482
<i>In the light of day</i>

570
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:38,406
<i>Let the storm rage on!</i>

571
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:43,012
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

572
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,452
Elsa!

573
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,001
Elsa!

574
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,405
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

575
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,651
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

576
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:03,970
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

577
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,006
Of course, none of it
would have happened

578
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:09,845
if she had just told me her secret.

579
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:12,012
She's a stinker.

580
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,206
Whoa!

581
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,647
Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back!

582
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:20,212
No,no,no!

583
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,452
Okay.

584
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,169
Snow. It had to be snow.

585
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:34,363
She couldn't have had tropical magic

586
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:37,809
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

587
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:41,086
Fire!

588
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,531
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

589
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,525
Ooh. "And sauna"!

590
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:17,412
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

591
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,967
Big summer blowout.

592
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,443
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

593
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:25,207
and a sun balm
of my own invention, yah?

594
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:29,803
Oh. Great.
For now, um, how about boots?

595
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,125
Winter boots and dresses?

596
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:34,570
That would be in our winter department.

597
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:38,932
Oh. Um...

598
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:40,681
I was just wondering.

599
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,849
Has another young woman...

600
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:45,652
The queen perhaps, I don't know,

601
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:46,802
passed through here?

602
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:48,372
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

603
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:50,250
is you, dear.

604
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,321
You and this fellow.

605
00:36:58,481 --> 00:36:59,448
<i>You-hoe.</i>

606
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:00,647
Big summer blowout.

607
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,802
Carrots.

608
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,127
Huh?

609
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,052
Behind you.

610
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,370
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

611
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,643
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

612
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,205
Wherever could it be coming from?

613
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,412
The North Mountain.

614
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:22,321
North Mountain.

615
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:24,047
That Will be 40.

616
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,771
Forty? No, 10.

617
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:26,928
Oh, dear, that's no good.

618
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,970
See, this is from our winter stock,

619
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:31,050
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

620
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:33,163
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

621
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:34,528
I sell ice for a living.

622
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:36,890
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

623
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,242
I mean, that is really...

624
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:40,522
That's unfortunate.

625
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,922
Still 40.

626
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,049
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

627
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:46,210
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

628
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,887
Yoo-hoo!

629
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,642
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

630
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,602
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.

631
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,002
Okay, just tell me one thing.

632
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,970
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

633
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,770
Did it seem magical?

634
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:00,451
Yes!

635
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:03,886
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

636
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,452
What did you call me?

637
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,211
Okay, okay. I'm out.

638
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:12,722
Whoa!

639
00:38:12,801 --> 00:38:14,087
Bye-bye.

640
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,242
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

641
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,165
But I did find us a place to sleep.

642
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,371
And it's free.

643
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:29,292
I'm sorry about this violence.

644
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:31,051
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

645
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:32,892
so we have good feelings.

646
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:34,731
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

647
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,162
Uh...

648
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:48,685
<i>Reindeers are better than people</i>

649
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,644
<i>Sven, don't you think that's true?</i>

650
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,090
<i>"Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you</i>

651
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:58,642
<i>"Every one of them's bad, except you"</i>

652
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,605
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

653
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:04,250
<i>But people smell better than reindeers</i>

654
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,566
<i>Sven, don't you think I'm right?</i>

655
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:11,968
<i>"That's once again true
For all, except you"</i>

656
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:15,411
<i>You got me
Let's call it a night</i>

657
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,210
<i>"Good night"</i>

658
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:21,926
<i>Don't let the frostbite</i>

659
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:24,402
<i>Bite</i>

660
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,646
Nice duet.

661
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,727
It's just you.
What do you want?

662
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,363
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

663
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,291
I don't take people places.

664
00:39:38,161 --> 00:39:39,686
Let me rephrase that.

665
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,206
Hey.

666
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,287
Take me up the North Mountain.

667
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,965
Please.

668
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:53,163
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

669
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:57,131
We leave at dawn.

670
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,723
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

671
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:01,927
Oops, sorry.

672
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:04,288
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

673
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,008
We leave now. Right now.

674
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:11,287
WheW!

675
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,323
Hang on! We like to go fast.

676
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,802
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

677
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,571
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

678
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:27,131
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

679
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,527
Ugh!

680
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:31,287
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.

681
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,206
So, uh, tell me,

682
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,444
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?

683
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:37,682
Oh. Well...

684
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:39,441
It was all my fault.

685
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:42,048
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,

686
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:44,772
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

687
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,771
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

688
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:50,363
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

689
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,684
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

690
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:54,762
and then she tried to walk away,

691
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:55,808
and I grabbed her glove...

692
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:56,882
Hang on!

693
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,930
You mean to tell me you got engaged

694
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,607
to someone you just met that day?

695
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:02,921
Yes. Pay attention.

696
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,131
But the thing is,
she wore the gloves all the time,

697
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,442
so I just thought,
maybe she has a thing about dirt.

698
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:11,485
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

699
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:13,970
Yes, they did.

700
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,762
But Hans is not a stranger.

701
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:18,851
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

702
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:21,407
"Of the Southern Isles. "

703
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:22,892
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

704
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,332
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

705
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:25,448
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

706
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:27,011
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

707
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:28,287
Have you had a meal with him yet?

708
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,846
What if you hate the way he eats?

709
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,332
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

710
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:32,602
Picks his nose?

711
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:33,928
And eats it.

712
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:36,402
Excuse me, sir. He is a prince.

713
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:38,926
- All men do it.
- Ew.

714
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:42,411
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.

715
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:43,722
It doesn't sound like true love.

716
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,327
Are you some
sort of love expert?

717
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:49,607
No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

718
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,161
You have friends

719
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:53,562
who are love experts? I'm not buying it.

720
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,131
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.

721
00:41:55,321 --> 00:41:56,891
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.

722
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:12,962
Sven,go.

723
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:14,208
Go!

724
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:16,292
- What are they?
- Wolves.

725
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,528
Wolves?

726
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,412
- What do we do?
- I got this.

727
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:23,688
You just...
Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.

728
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:24,728
But I want to help!

729
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:25,848
- No.
- Why not?

730
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:26,922
Because I don't trust your judgment.

731
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,207
Excuse me?

732
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:30,045
Who marries a man she just met?

733
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:31,361
It's true love!

734
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:32,602
Whoa!

735
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:34,092
VVhoa. VVhoa!

736
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:35,686
Christopher!

737
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,252
It's "Kristoff"!

738
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,652
Ow!

739
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:43,008
Duck!

740
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:48,652
You almost set me on fire!

741
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:49,762
But I didn't.

742
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:57,647
Get ready to jump, Sven!

743
00:42:57,761 --> 00:42:59,172
You don't tell him what to do.

744
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:00,646
- Hey!
- I do!

745
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:02,762
Jump, Sven!

746
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:13,922
Phew!

747
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:18,687
But I just paid it Off.

748
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:20,845
Uh-oh. No. No.

749
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:22,448
No!

750
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:24,250
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

751
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,482
Grab on!

752
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:27,127
Pull, Sven. Pull!

753
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,091
Whoa.

754
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:42,489
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

755
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:48,082
And I understand
if you don't want to help me anymore.

756
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:56,247
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

757
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:59,964
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

758
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,008
AN NAl It's this way?

759
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:03,049
"She'll die on her own. "

760
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:04,885
- I can live with that.
Here we go.

761
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:08,125
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead. "

762
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:09,732
I think, actually, it's up.

763
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,332
Sometimes, I really don't like you.

764
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,722
Hold up! We're coming.

765
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,328
You are?

766
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:18,484
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

767
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:31,006
Arendelle.

768
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:33,729
It's completely frozen.

769
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:38,007
But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

770
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:39,367
Will she?

771
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:41,045
Yeah. Now, come on.

772
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:42,885
This way to the North Mountain?

773
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:45,447
More like this way.

774
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:21,963
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

775
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,361
Yeah.

776
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:26,484
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

777
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:28,162
But it's so white.

778
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:30,411
You know, how about a little color?

779
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:33,850
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

780
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,446
How about yellow?

781
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:37,764
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?

782
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,412
No go.

783
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:44,731
Am I right?

784
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:46,162
- Hi.
- You're creepy.

785
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:47,527
Whoa!
- I don't want it.

786
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,006
- Back at you.
Please don't drop me.

787
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,287
- No.
- Come on, it's just a head.

788
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:51,601
All right. We got off to a bad start.

789
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:52,887
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

790
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,731
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

791
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,452
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

792
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:02,852
All right, wait one second.

793
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,332
Oh. Uh...

794
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,687
Oh!

795
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:07,126
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

796
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:08,328
Now, I'm perfect.

797
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:10,887
Well, almost.

798
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,090
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

799
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:15,242
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

800
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:17,286
- Head rush!
- I was just... Are you okay?

801
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,683
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

802
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,531
I've always wanted a nose.

803
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,042
So cute.

804
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,805
It's like a little baby unicorn.

805
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:26,928
But... Hey! Whoa!

806
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:27,968
Oh.

807
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,850
I love it even more.

808
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,886
All right,
let's start this thing over.

809
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:34,168
Hi, everyone.

810
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:35,242
I'm Olaf.

811
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:36,527
And I like warm hugs.

812
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:39,082
Olaf?

813
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:44,210
That's right. Olaf.

814
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,409
And you are?

815
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,882
Oh. Um...

816
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:50,162
I'm Anna.

817
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,608
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

818
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,171
- That's Sven.
- Uh-huh.

819
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:56,130
And who's the reindeer?

820
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:57,168
Sven.

821
00:46:57,241 --> 00:47:00,006
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.

822
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,561
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

823
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:04,684
- I like you, too.
- Olaf.

824
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,323
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?

825
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:08,642
Do you know where she is?

826
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:09,842
- Fascinating.
- Yeah. Why?

827
00:47:09,921 --> 00:47:11,332
Do you think you could
show us the way?

828
00:47:11,481 --> 00:47:12,482
Yeah. Why?

829
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:14,047
How does this work? Ow!

830
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:16,283
Stop it, Sven. I'm trying to focus, here.

831
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:18,363
<i>- Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.</i>

832
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:20,446
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

833
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:22,451
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

834
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:23,761
Oh. I don't know why,

835
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,527
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

836
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:31,083
And sun, and all things hot.

837
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:32,202
Really?

838
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:34,761
I'm guessing you
don't have much experience with heat.

839
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:35,922
Nope.

840
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,682
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

841
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:42,607
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

842
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:50,050
<i>Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz</i>

843
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:54,888
<i>And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer</i>

844
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:58,768
<i>A drink in my hand</i>

845
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,162
<i>My snow up against the burning sand</i>

846
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:03,448
<i>Probably getting gorgeously tanned</i>

847
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,091
<i>In summer</i>

848
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:07,803
<i>I'll finally see a summer breeze</i>

849
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,929
<i>Blow away a winter storm</i>

850
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:12,208
<i>And find out what happens
to solid water</i>

851
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:15,012
<i>When it gets warm</i>

852
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:18,889
<i>And I can't wait to see</i>

853
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:20,844
<i>What my buddies all think of me</i>

854
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:23,722
<i>Just imagine how much cooler I'll be</i>

855
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,008
<i>In summer!</i>

856
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:32,569
<i>The hot and the cold
are both so intense</i>

857
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:35,048
<i>Put them together
It just makes sense</i>

858
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:41,569
<i>Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle</i>

859
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,524
<i>But put me in summer and I'll be a...</i>

860
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,525
<i>Happy snowman!</i>

861
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:47,727
<i>When life gets rough</i>

862
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:50,202
<i>I like to hold on to my dream</i>

863
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:55,208
<i>Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam</i>

864
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,446
<i>Oh, the sky</i>

865
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,086
<i>Will be blue</i>

866
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:03,525
<i>And you guys will be there, too</i>

867
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,601
<i>When I finally do</i>

868
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,969
<i>What frozen things do
In summer!</i>

869
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,685
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

870
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:16,488
<i>In summer!</i>

871
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:22,482
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

872
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:25,690
Let's go bring back summer!

873
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,001
I'm coming!

874
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,326
Somebody's gotta tell him.

875
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:37,962
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.

876
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,566
The bark needs to be face-up.

877
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:42,168
- Bark down is drier.
Bark up!

878
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,208
Bark down!
Papa!

879
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,885
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

880
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:48,005
Arendelle is indebted to you,
Your Highness.

881
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:49,487
The castle is open.

882
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:52,531
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.

883
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:53,848
Here, pass these out.

884
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:55,286
Prince Hans!

885
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:57,927
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

886
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,447
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

887
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,332
Princess Anna has given her orders.

888
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:04,130
And that's another thing!

889
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,727
Has it dawned on you
that your princess may be conspiring

890
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:07,927
with a wicked sorceress

891
00:50:08,121 --> 00:50:09,122
to destroy us all?

892
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,771
Do not question the princess.

893
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:12,412
She left me in charge

894
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:13,721
and I will not hesitate

895
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:15,326
to protect Arendelle from treason.

896
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,131
Treason?

897
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:23,648
VVhoa!VVhoa!

898
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,450
Whoa, boy. Easy.

899
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:26,602
Easy.

900
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:27,842
It's Princess Anna's horse.

901
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,726
So, where is the princess?

902
00:50:30,121 --> 00:50:31,452
Where could she be?
Where is she?

903
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:33,606
Princess Anna is in trouble.

904
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:37,086
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

905
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:38,322
<i>- I'll go.
- I volunteer.</i>

906
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:40,369
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

907
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,292
Be prepared for anything.

908
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:44,643
And should you encounter the queen,

909
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,767
you are to put an end to this winter.

910
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:49,892
- Do you understand?
- Hmm.

911
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:57,006
So, how exactly
are you planning to stop this weather?

912
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,882
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

913
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:01,322
That's your plan?

914
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:04,291
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

915
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,567
Yep.

916
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:07,686
So, you're not at all afraid of her?

917
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:09,691
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

918
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:14,444
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

919
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:16,651
Oh. Look at that.

920
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:19,008
I've been impaled.

921
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,328
What now?

922
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,810
Mmm...

923
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:28,728
It's too steep.

924
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,247
I've only got one rope and you don't
know how to climb mountains.

925
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,607
<i>Says who'?</i>

926
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:33,921
Hmm?

927
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:35,362
What are you doing?

928
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:39,447
I'm going to see my sister.

929
00:51:39,881 --> 00:51:41,042
You're gonna kill yourself.

930
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:43,762
I wouldn't put my foot there.

931
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:45,491
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

932
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:47,564
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

933
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:49,291
All right. I'm just blocking you out

934
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,052
because I gotta concentrate, here.

935
00:51:52,441 --> 00:51:53,806
You know, most people who disappear

936
00:51:53,921 --> 00:51:55,252
into the mountains want to be alone.

937
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:57,683
Nobody wants to be alone.

938
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,248
Except maybe you.

939
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:02,450
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

940
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:05,165
You mean, the love experts?

941
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,364
Yes, the love experts.

942
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:09,565
Ah...

943
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:11,891
Please tell me I'm almost there.

944
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:15,363
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

945
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,042
Hang on.

946
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:19,122
Hey, Sven?

947
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:21,130
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

948
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,209
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

949
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:24,407
where you wanted to go.

950
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:26,404
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

951
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:30,687
Thanks.
That was like a crazy trust exercise.

952
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,687
Whoa.

953
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:47,604
Now, that's ice.

954
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:49,727
I might cry.

955
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:52,372
Go ahead. I won't judge.

956
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:01,610
All right, take it easy, boy. Come here.

957
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,286
<i>I got you.</i>

958
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:06,128
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

959
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:09,407
Flawless.

960
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:15,682
Knock.

961
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:18,012
Just knock.

962
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:20,571
Why isn't she knocking?

963
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:22,966
Do you think she knows how to knock?

964
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:29,883
Huh. It opened.

965
00:53:29,961 --> 00:53:31,247
That's a first.

966
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,447
Oh. You should probably wait out here.

967
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:36,489
- What?
- The last time I introduced her to a guy,

968
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:37,927
she froze everything.

969
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,844
But, but... Oh, come on!

970
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,686
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!

971
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:43,928
Bye, Sven.

972
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:45,571
You, too, Olaf.

973
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:47,730
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

974
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:49,327
Okay.

975
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:52,091
One, two,

976
00:53:52,841 --> 00:53:54,525
- three...
Four...

977
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,082
Whoa.

978
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:07,362
Elsa?

979
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:10,244
It's me, Anna.

980
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:15,766
Anna.

981
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:22,963
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

982
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,091
It's a good different.

983
00:54:25,441 --> 00:54:26,727
And this place...

984
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:28,367
It's amazing.

985
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:29,682
Thank you.

986
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:32,083
I never knew what I was capable of.

987
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:35,406
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

988
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,607
No, no, no. It's okay.

989
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:40,891
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

990
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:42,808
Please.

991
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,042
But I just got here.

992
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:46,365
You belong down in Arendelle.

993
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:47,802
So do you.

994
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:50,009
No, Anna, I belong here.

995
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,202
Alone.

996
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:56,651
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

997
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,884
Actually, about that...

998
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:01,171
Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?

999
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,327
Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!

1000
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,168
Olaf?

1001
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:08,082
Yeah. You built me.

1002
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:09,842
Remember that?

1003
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:11,448
And you're alive?

1004
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,403
Um... I think so.

1005
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:18,487
He's just like the one we built as kids.

1006
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:20,847
Yeah.

1007
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:23,250
Elsa, we were so close.

1008
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:25,325
We can be like that again.

1009
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:27,887
Catch me!
Slow down!

1010
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:32,962
Anna!

1011
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:36,688
No.

1012
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:39,241
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1013
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:40,482
Elsa, wait.

1014
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,609
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

1015
00:55:42,761 --> 00:55:45,412
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1016
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:48,084
Please don't shut me out again.

1017
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:50,443
<i>Please don't slam the door</i>

1018
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:54,412
<i>You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore</i>

1019
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,411
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1020
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:59,690
<i>I finally understand</i>

1021
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:02,088
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

1022
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,368
<i>We can fix this hand in hand</i>

1023
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:06,409
We can head down
this mountain together.

1024
00:56:06,681 --> 00:56:09,525
<i>You don't have to live in fear</i>

1025
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:13,362
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1026
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:16,770
<i>I Will be right here</i>

1027
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,002
Anna.

1028
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:20,044
<i>Please go back home</i>

1029
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:21,691
<i>Your life awaits</i>

1030
00:56:22,761 --> 00:56:26,129
<i>Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates</i>

1031
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:27,652
- Yeah, but...
- I know.

1032
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:31,851
<i>You mean well
But leave me be</i>

1033
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:33,486
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>

1034
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:36,405
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>

1035
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:41,083
<i>Just stay away
And you'll be safe from me</i>

1036
00:56:42,321 --> 00:56:43,322
<i>Actually, we're not</i>

1037
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:44,682
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

1038
00:56:44,761 --> 00:56:46,251
<i>I get the feeling you don't know</i>

1039
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:47,482
<i>What do I not know?</i>

1040
00:56:48,001 --> 00:56:51,323
<i>Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep</i>

1041
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:53,483
<i>Deep snow</i>

1042
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:54,842
What?

1043
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:58,803
You kind of set off
an eternal winter everywhere.

1044
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,202
Everywhere?

1045
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:02,090
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

1046
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:04,329
No, I can't. I don't know how.

1047
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:06,882
Sure you can. I know you can.

1048
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:09,602
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1049
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:13,448
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!</i>

1050
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,683
<i>You don't have to be afraid</i>

1051
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:18,765
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>

1052
00:57:18,841 --> 00:57:20,764
<i>We can work this out together</i>

1053
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:22,605
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

1054
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:25,850
<i>We'll reverse the storm you've made</i>

1055
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:29,045
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>

1056
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:31,203
<i>Don't panic
There's so much fear!</i>

1057
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:32,766
<i>We'll make the sun shine bright</i>

1058
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,252
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

1059
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:35,971
<i>We can face this thing together</i>

1060
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,042
<i>No!</i>

1061
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,203
<i>We can change this winter weather</i>

1062
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:42,569
<i>And everything will be all right</i>

1063
00:57:43,321 --> 00:57:45,562
<i>I can't!</i>

1064
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:54,242
Anna!

1065
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:56,002
Are you okay?

1066
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:57,407
I'm okay.

1067
00:57:57,481 --> 00:57:58,721
I'm fine.

1068
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,082
Who's this?

1069
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:01,572
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

1070
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:03,122
You have to go.

1071
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:05,886
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1072
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:07,002
How?

1073
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:09,243
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1074
00:58:09,721 --> 00:58:10,847
To stop me?

1075
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,486
Anna, I think we should go.

1076
00:58:12,561 --> 00:58:14,450
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

1077
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:16,245
Yes, you are.

1078
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,731
Stop! Put us down!

1079
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:28,405
Go away.

1080
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:33,366
Heads up!

1081
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:35,367
Watch out for my butt!

1082
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:39,886
It is not nice to throw people!

1083
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:42,123
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.

1084
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:44,522
- Just calm down! Calm down!
- Okay! All right!

1085
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:46,205
- I'm okay.
- Just let the snowman be.

1086
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:47,442
- I'm calm.
- Great.

1087
00:58:47,601 --> 00:58:49,126
Oh! Come on!

1088
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:54,772
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1089
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:56,605
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1090
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:59,132
No, no! Not you guys!

1091
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:02,132
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1092
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:06,122
Look out!

1093
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:20,485
Run! Run!

1094
00:59:20,721 --> 00:59:22,564
What are you doing?

1095
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:27,242
<i>I got him!</i>

1096
00:59:27,641 --> 00:59:29,086
Whoa! Stop!

1097
00:59:29,161 --> 00:59:30,208
It's a 100-foot drop.

1098
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:31,808
It's 200.

1099
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:33,322
OW!

1100
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:36,049
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

1101
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,691
Okay. What if We fall?

1102
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:39,971
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1103
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:41,805
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

1104
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:42,882
Hopefully.

1105
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:48,130
Okay, Anna. On three.

1106
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:49,487
Okay.
One...

1107
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:50,562
You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

1108
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:52,211
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!

1109
00:59:52,281 --> 00:59:53,362
Calm down.

1110
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:57,482
Tree!

1111
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,762
What the... Whoa!

1112
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,405
That happened.

1113
01:00:03,721 --> 01:00:05,450
Man, am I out of shape.

1114
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,450
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1115
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:14,285
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1116
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,012
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.

1117
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:19,882
Hey! We were just talking about you.

1118
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:22,009
All good things, all good things.

1119
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:23,522
No!

1120
01:00:27,281 --> 01:00:30,046
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1121
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:32,722
Olaf!

1122
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:34,565
Hang in there, guys!

1123
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:35,888
Go. Go faster!

1124
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:39,611
- Wait, what?
Hey!

1125
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,531
Ow!

1126
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:46,887
Kristoff!

1127
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,609
Don't come back!

1128
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:52,322
We won't.

1129
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,285
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

1130
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:04,687
Olaf!

1131
01:01:05,321 --> 01:01:07,927
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!

1132
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,410
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!

1133
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:12,926
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

1134
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:14,970
Oh. That feels better.

1135
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:17,722
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1136
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,084
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1137
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,084
Don't talk to him like that.

1138
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:23,965
You're tickling me.

1139
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,082
Here.

1140
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:27,522
Whoa!

1141
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:28,727
Are you okay?

1142
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:30,166
Thank you.

1143
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:32,327
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!

1144
01:01:34,121 --> 01:01:35,361
It's fine. Uh...

1145
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,966
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.

1146
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:38,930
I don't have a skull.

1147
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:40,722
Or bones.

1148
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:43,442
So, uh... So, now what?

1149
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:45,725
NOW What?

1150
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:47,087
Now what?

1151
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:48,282
Oh...

1152
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:49,841
What am I gonna do?

1153
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:51,772
She threw me out.

1154
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,128
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1155
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:55,202
And then there's your ice business.

1156
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:57,807
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about my ice business.

1157
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:00,685
- Worry about your hair!
- What?

1158
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:02,570
I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1159
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:04,166
No, yours is turning white.

1160
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:07,092
White? It's... What?

1161
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:09,283
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

1162
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:11,491
Does it look bad?

1163
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:13,932
- No.
- You hesitated.

1164
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,088
No, I didn't.

1165
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:17,489
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.

1166
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:19,051
Okay! Where are we going?

1167
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:20,288
To see my friends.

1168
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,601
The love experts?

1169
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:23,331
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.

1170
01:02:23,801 --> 01:02:26,008
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1171
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:27,811
How do you know?

1172
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:30,524
Because I've seen them do it before.

1173
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:34,082
I like to consider myself a love expert.

1174
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,371
Get it together.

1175
01:02:41,001 --> 01:02:42,412
Control it.

1176
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:44,165
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1177
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:46,291
Don't feel.

1178
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:48,125
Don't feel!

1179
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:05,208
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1180
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:10,370
- Are you cold?
- A little.

1181
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,884
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1182
01:03:14,961 --> 01:03:16,042
Huh?

1183
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:18,052
Ooh.

1184
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:22,729
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

1185
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:24,207
I say "friends"...

1186
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:26,329
They're more like family.

1187
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:29,211
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1188
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:31,290
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.

1189
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,166
- They did?
- Yeah.

1190
01:03:33,561 --> 01:03:34,608
I don't want to scare you.

1191
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:39,005
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1192
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:40,486
Very loud.

1193
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:42,610
They are also stubborn at times,

1194
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:43,887
and a little overbearing.

1195
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,646
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.

1196
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:49,048
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1197
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:51,249
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1198
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:54,772
Okay, then.

1199
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:57,290
Meet my family.

1200
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,202
Hey, guys.

1201
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:01,251
They're rocks.

1202
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:03,728
You are
a sight for sore eyes.

1203
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:06,532
He's crazy.

1204
01:04:07,161 --> 01:04:09,289
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

1205
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:11,848
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.

1206
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:12,922
You lost so much weight.

1207
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,931
I'll distract
him while you run.

1208
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:17,924
Hi, Sven's family!

1209
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:20,602
It's nice to meet you.

1210
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:23,362
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1211
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:27,332
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1212
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:29,291
Why aren't you running?

1213
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:30,727
Uh...

1214
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:33,088
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1215
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,245
Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1216
01:04:37,721 --> 01:04:39,291
Kristoff!

1217
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:41,245
Whoa!

1218
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:42,967
Hey!

1219
01:04:44,001 --> 01:04:45,366
Kristoff's home!

1220
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:49,770
Kristoff's here!
- Kristoff's home!

1221
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:52,128
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.

1222
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:53,732
Ah, let me look at you.

1223
01:04:53,801 --> 01:04:55,405
Take off your clothes, I wash them.

1224
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:57,165
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.

1225
01:04:57,401 --> 01:04:58,732
Look, it's great to see you all,

1226
01:04:58,801 --> 01:04:59,927
but where's Granpabbie?

1227
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:01,088
He's napping.

1228
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:02,845
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1229
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:04,486
- L...
- I earned my fire crystal.

1230
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:05,801
I passed a kidney stone.

1231
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:07,167
Kristoff, pick me up.

1232
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,527
You're getting big.

1233
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:09,682
Good for you.

1234
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:12,369
Trolls. They're trolls!

1235
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:16,925
He's brought a girl!

1236
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:18,687
A girl!

1237
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,685
- Whoa!
Is that a real girl?

1238
01:05:20,761 --> 01:05:22,809
She's like a little cupcake.

1239
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:23,882
What's going on?

1240
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,087
I've learned to just roll with it.

1241
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,801
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,

1242
01:05:27,881 --> 01:05:29,212
strong teeth!

1243
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:32,166
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1244
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:33,442
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

1245
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:34,852
- No.
- You've got the wrong idea.

1246
01:05:34,921 --> 01:05:36,002
No. That's not why I brought her here.

1247
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,890
Right. We're not... I'm not...

1248
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:39,963
What's the issue, dear?

1249
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:43,244
Why are you holding back
from such a man?

1250
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:45,130
<i>Is it the clumpy way he walks?</i>

1251
01:05:45,361 --> 01:05:47,602
<i>- What?
- Or the grumpy way he talks?</i>

1252
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,410
<i>- Oh, no.
- Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped</i>

1253
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:50,971
<i>Weirdness of his feet?</i>

1254
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,088
Hey!

1255
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,050
<i>And though we know he washes well</i>

1256
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,601
<i>He always ends up sort of smelly</i>

1257
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:58,331
<i>But you'll never meet a fella</i>

1258
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:00,290
<i>Who's as sensitive and sweet</i>

1259
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:01,408
That's nice, but...

1260
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:03,404
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1261
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:05,523
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- So, he's got a few flaws</i>

1262
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:06,762
<i>Like his peculiar brain, dear</i>

1263
01:06:06,841 --> 01:06:07,922
<i>His thing with the reindeer</i>

1264
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:09,605
<i>That's a little outside
of nature's laws</i>

1265
01:06:09,681 --> 01:06:10,728
This is not about me!

1266
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,485
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1267
01:06:12,561 --> 01:06:14,689
<i>But this we're certain of</i>

1268
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:17,332
<i>You can fix this fixer-upper up</i>

1269
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:19,130
<i>- With a little bit of love
- Um...</i>

1270
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:21,169
Can we please
just stop talking about this?

1271
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:23,403
We've got a real, actual problem, here.

1272
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:25,882
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

1273
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:28,290
<i>Is it the way that he runs scared?</i>

1274
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:30,250
<i>Or that he's socially impaired?</i>

1275
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:33,804
<i>Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?</i>

1276
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:34,928
I did not need to know that.

1277
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:37,129
<i>Are you holding back your fondness</i>

1278
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:38,572
<i>Due to his unmanly blondness?</i>

1279
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,204
<i>Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?</i>

1280
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,410
<i>He's just a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1281
01:06:46,521 --> 01:06:47,966
<i>He's got a couple of bugs</i>

1282
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,851
<i>- No, I don't!
- His isolation is confirmation</i>

1283
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:53,765
<i>- Of his desperation for healing hugs
- Aw.</i>

1284
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:55,411
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1285
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:58,132
<i>But we know what to do</i>

1286
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:00,209
<i>The way to fix up this fixer-upper</i>

1287
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:01,771
<i>Is to fix him up with you</i>

1288
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:03,331
Whoa!

1289
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:04,966
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!

1290
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:08,167
She is engaged to someone else, okay?

1291
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:14,009
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1292
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,810
<i>That's a minor thing</i>

1293
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:18,283
<i>Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement</i>

1294
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:20,768
<i>And by the way, I don't see no ring</i>

1295
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:23,048
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1296
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:25,123
<i>- Hey! Whoa, watch it!
- Her brain's a bit betwixt</i>

1297
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,728
<i>Get the fiance out of the way</i>

1298
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:28,962
<i>And the whole thing will be fixed</i>

1299
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:33,809
<i>We're not saying you can change him</i>

1300
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:35,850
<i>'Cause people don't really change</i>

1301
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:38,602
<i>We're only saying that love's a force</i>

1302
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:40,968
<i>That's powerful and strange</i>

1303
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,203
<i>People make bad choices</i>

1304
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:45,488
<i>If they're mad or scared or stressed</i>

1305
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:48,726
<i>But throw a little love their way</i>

1306
01:07:48,801 --> 01:07:51,088
<i>Throw a little love their way</i>

1307
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:53,084
<i>And you'll bring out their best</i>

1308
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,489
<i>True love brings out the best</i>

1309
01:07:55,961 --> 01:07:58,168
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1310
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:00,251
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

1311
01:08:00,321 --> 01:08:01,322
- Father!
- Sister!

1312
01:08:01,401 --> 01:08:04,132
<i>- Brother!
- We need each other to raise us up</i>

1313
01:08:04,201 --> 01:08:05,362
<i>And round us out</i>

1314
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:07,890
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1315
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:11,363
<i>But when push comes to shove</i>

1316
01:08:11,481 --> 01:08:12,687
<i>The only fixer-upper fixer</i>

1317
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:13,762
<i>That can fix a fixer-upper is...</i>

1318
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:17,163
<i>True, true</i>

1319
01:08:17,281 --> 01:08:18,328
<i>True</i>

1320
01:08:18,401 --> 01:08:19,402
<i>Love!</i>

1321
01:08:19,481 --> 01:08:20,767
<i>Love, love, love</i>

1322
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:22,764
<i>Love
True love</i>

1323
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:23,922
<i>True</i>

1324
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:28,131
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff
to be your trollfully wedded...

1325
01:08:28,201 --> 01:08:30,090
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.

1326
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:31,242
Love!

1327
01:08:31,321 --> 01:08:32,402
Anna?

1328
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:34,607
She's as cold as ice.

1329
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,971
There is strange magic here.

1330
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,364
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her here to me.

1331
01:08:43,841 --> 01:08:46,526
Anna, your life is in danger.

1332
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:50,125
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1333
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:55,449
If not removed,
to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1334
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,167
What? No.

1335
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:58,527
But you can remove it, right?

1336
01:08:58,681 --> 01:08:59,728
I cannot.

1337
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,690
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1338
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:04,288
If it was her head, that would be easy.

1339
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:09,202
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1340
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:11,606
An act of true love?

1341
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:13,968
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1342
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:20,208
Something's wrong.
Are you all right?

1343
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,807
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1344
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:23,928
Hans.

1345
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:25,002
Pull us out, Sven.

1346
01:09:27,961 --> 01:09:29,167
Olaf, come on!

1347
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,886
I'm coming!

1348
01:09:31,321 --> 01:09:33,164
Let's go kiss Hans!

1349
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:35,285
Who is this Hans?

1350
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,290
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1351
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:51,243
Be on guard,
but no harm is to come to the queen.

1352
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:53,802
Do you understand?

1353
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:55,246
Yes, Your Grace.

1354
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:18,292
The queen.

1355
01:10:23,401 --> 01:10:25,369
Go, go! Come on!

1356
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,688
There!

1357
01:10:33,321 --> 01:10:34,368
Up there!

1358
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:36,126
Come on!

1359
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:38,882
We got her.

1360
01:10:39,481 --> 01:10:40,721
No. Please.

1361
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,331
Go around. Toss it.

1362
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,687
Stay away!

1363
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:50,127
LOOK out!

1364
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,771
Fire! Fire!

1365
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:54,047
Get her!

1366
01:10:57,121 --> 01:10:58,122
Ah!

1367
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:02,727
Come on!

1368
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:13,808
Grab his arm.

1369
01:11:17,241 --> 01:11:18,242
Aim...

1370
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:47,128
This way, this way!

1371
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:48,242
Whoa!

1372
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:51,648
Queen Elsa!

1373
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:54,562
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1374
01:12:42,521 --> 01:12:44,728
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?

1375
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:53,292
Why did you bring me here?

1376
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:55,286
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1377
01:12:55,441 --> 01:12:58,570
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1378
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:01,123
Anna has not returned.

1379
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:04,849
If you would just stop the winter.

1380
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:07,647
Bring back summer, please.

1381
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:10,446
Don't you see?

1382
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:12,081
I can't.

1383
01:13:15,681 --> 01:13:18,082
You have to tell them to let me go.

1384
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,690
I will do what I can.

1385
01:13:45,681 --> 01:13:46,921
Just hang in there.

1386
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:48,162
Come on, buddy, faster!

1387
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:55,282
Oh, boy!

1388
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:57,363
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1389
01:13:57,681 --> 01:13:58,921
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1390
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,526
I will!

1391
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:03,962
- Hello!
- It's alive!

1392
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:14,526
It's Princess Anna!

1393
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:24,770
Are you gonna be okay?

1394
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:28,610
Don't worry about me.

1395
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:30,445
Anna!

1396
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:32,364
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1397
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:35,365
Get her warm.
And find Prince Hans, immediately.

1398
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:36,852
We will. Thank you.

1399
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:38,532
Make sure she's safe.

1400
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,611
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1401
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:43,890
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1402
01:14:57,481 --> 01:14:59,290
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1403
01:14:59,401 --> 01:15:01,051
You cannot risk going out there again.

1404
01:15:01,441 --> 01:15:02,488
If anything happens to her...

1405
01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:04,365
If anything happens to the princess,

1406
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:06,928
you are all Arendelle has left.

1407
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,450
He's in here.

1408
01:15:10,521 --> 01:15:11,568
Prince Hans.

1409
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:12,927
Anna.

1410
01:15:13,081 --> 01:15:14,128
You're so cold.

1411
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:15,362
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1412
01:15:15,441 --> 01:15:17,091
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.

1413
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:18,890
We'll give you two some privacy.

1414
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:20,967
What happened out there?

1415
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:22,930
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1416
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:24,606
You said she would never hurt you.

1417
01:15:24,681 --> 01:15:25,682
I was wrong.

1418
01:15:25,761 --> 01:15:27,126
Anna.

1419
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:31,491
She froze my heart,

1420
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:34,167
and only an act of true love can save me.

1421
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:37,605
A true love's kiss.

1422
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:48,961
Oh, Anna.

1423
01:15:50,481 --> 01:15:53,451
If only there was
someone out there who loved you.

1424
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:54,801
What?

1425
01:15:58,481 --> 01:16:00,085
You said you did.

1426
01:16:01,441 --> 01:16:04,126
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

1427
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:05,407
I didn't stand a chance.

1428
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:09,167
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1429
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:10,606
What... What are you talking about?

1430
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:13,568
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1431
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:15,730
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1432
01:16:15,841 --> 01:16:16,842
- But you...
- Hans!

1433
01:16:16,921 --> 01:16:18,366
You were so desperate for love,

1434
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:21,172
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1435
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,530
I figured after we married,

1436
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:26,609
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1437
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:28,849
Hans!
No. Stop.

1438
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:31,089
But then, she doomed herself,

1439
01:16:31,161 --> 01:16:33,050
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.

1440
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,168
Please.

1441
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,721
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,

1442
01:16:37,441 --> 01:16:38,772
and bring back summer.

1443
01:16:39,401 --> 01:16:41,369
You're no match for Elsa.

1444
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:43,648
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1445
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:45,482
I, on the other hand,

1446
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:50,530
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1447
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:52,812
You won't get away with this.

1448
01:16:53,361 --> 01:16:54,408
Oh...

1449
01:16:55,201 --> 01:16:56,612
I already have.

1450
01:17:02,441 --> 01:17:04,125
Please, somebody, help.

1451
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,924
Please. Please.

1452
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:14,930
It's getting colder by the minute.

1453
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:18,642
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1454
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:20,132
Prince Hans.

1455
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:22,244
Princess Anna is...

1456
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:24,168
Dead.

1457
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:25,242
What?

1458
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:26,811
What happened to her?

1459
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,251
She was killed.

1460
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:34,961
By Queen Elsa.

1461
01:17:35,081 --> 01:17:36,128
No!

1462
01:17:36,481 --> 01:17:37,482
Her own sister.

1463
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:40,768
At least we got to say our marriage vows

1464
01:17:43,001 --> 01:17:45,083
before she died in my arms.

1465
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:48,531
There can be no doubt now.

1466
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:50,326
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1467
01:17:50,401 --> 01:17:52,324
and we are all in grave danger.

1468
01:17:52,561 --> 01:17:53,722
Prince Hans,

1469
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:56,284
Arendelle looks to you.

1470
01:17:57,961 --> 01:17:59,645
With a heavy heart,

1471
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:03,692
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1472
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,769
And sentence her to death.

1473
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:20,282
Hurry up!

1474
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:21,562
She's dangerous.

1475
01:18:21,641 --> 01:18:22,802
- Move quickly.
Careful.

1476
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:26,051
- it won't open!
It's frozen shut.

1477
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:27,487
Put your back into it!

1478
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:29,211
Come on! Push!

1479
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,482
What is it, buddy?

1480
01:18:56,561 --> 01:18:58,006
Hey, watch it.

1481
01:18:58,561 --> 01:18:59,562
What's wrong with you?

1482
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:05,083
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1483
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:08,008
Stop it! Put me down!

1484
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:11,527
No, Sven!

1485
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:13,166
We're not going back.

1486
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:14,731
She's with her true love.

1487
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:22,722
What the...

1488
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,642
Anna!

1489
01:19:32,961 --> 01:19:34,486
Come on! Come on, boy.

1490
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:53,682
Help.

1491
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,326
Anna!

1492
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:02,481
Oh, no.

1493
01:20:14,721 --> 01:20:15,882
Olaf?

1494
01:20:16,281 --> 01:20:18,283
Olaf. Get away from there.

1495
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:19,962
Wow!

1496
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:22,808
So, this is heat.

1497
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:24,252
I love it.

1498
01:20:24,441 --> 01:20:26,011
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1499
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:37,245
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1500
01:20:37,761 --> 01:20:41,607
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1501
01:20:42,081 --> 01:20:43,526
But we ran all the way here.

1502
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:47,163
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here.
You'll melt.

1503
01:20:47,241 --> 01:20:48,288
I am not leaving here until

1504
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:50,932
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1505
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:53,170
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1506
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:55,211
I don't even know what love is.

1507
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,285
That's okay, I do.

1508
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,086
<i>Love 'vs</i>

1509
01:21:00,081 --> 01:21:02,448
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1510
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:07,012
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1511
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,330
Kristoff loves me?

1512
01:21:13,881 --> 01:21:17,408
Wow, you really
don't know anything about love, do you?

1513
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,725
Olaf, you're melting.

1514
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,203
Some people are worth melting for.

1515
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:29,443
Just maybe not right this second.

1516
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:33,087
Don't worry, I've got it.

1517
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:37,724
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

1518
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:39,491
Hang on, I'm getting something.

1519
01:21:40,601 --> 01:21:43,002
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1520
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:44,367
They're coming back this way.

1521
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,162
They... They are?

1522
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:48,961
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1523
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:50,567
I guess I was wrong.

1524
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:53,008
I guess Kristoff doesn't
love you enough to leave you behind.

1525
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:55,764
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1526
01:21:55,841 --> 01:21:58,924
No, no, no! You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1527
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:00,685
I need to get to Kristoff.

1528
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:01,842
Why?

1529
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:04,767
Oh, I know Why!

1530
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,089
There's your act of true love right there!

1531
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:11,086
Riding across the fjords
like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1532
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:12,447
Come on!

1533
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:16,446
Look out!

1534
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:17,761
<i>"OW.!</i>

1535
01:22:24,681 --> 01:22:26,171
Uh... Back this way.

1536
01:22:27,561 --> 01:22:29,051
We're trapped.

1537
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:42,681
on...

1538
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:48,211
Whoa!

1539
01:22:51,441 --> 01:22:52,931
Slide, Anna!

1540
01:23:01,961 --> 01:23:03,372
We made it!

1541
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:06,131
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1542
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:20,371
Come on, buddy, faster.

1543
01:23:22,801 --> 01:23:24,212
Kristoff!

1544
01:23:30,081 --> 01:23:31,446
Keep going!

1545
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:35,286
Kristoff!

1546
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:47,968
Come on!

1547
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:03,368
No.

1548
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:19,642
Whoa!

1549
01:24:27,201 --> 01:24:28,851
Whoa!

1550
01:24:30,241 --> 01:24:31,811
Sven... Sven!

1551
01:24:42,321 --> 01:24:43,766
Good boy.

1552
01:24:55,241 --> 01:24:56,572
Kristoff.

1553
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:59,410
- Kristoff...
- Anna...

1554
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:01,402
Anna!

1555
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:08,170
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1556
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:12,490
Just take care of my sister.

1557
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,086
Your sister?

1558
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:16,727
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1559
01:25:17,121 --> 01:25:19,169
She said that you froze her heart.

1560
01:25:19,241 --> 01:25:20,242
No.

1561
01:25:20,401 --> 01:25:22,449
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1562
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:26,242
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

1563
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:29,371
Your sister is dead.

1564
01:25:30,201 --> 01:25:31,805
Because of you.

1565
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:33,048
No.

1566
01:25:55,321 --> 01:25:56,322
Kristoff.

1567
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:59,251
Anna!

1568
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:13,206
Elsa?

1569
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:22,608
No!

1570
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:36,202
Anna!

1571
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:38,651
Oh. Anna!

1572
01:26:39,521 --> 01:26:41,603
No, no!

1573
01:26:41,881 --> 01:26:43,246
Please, no.

1574
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:53,002
Anna?

1575
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:35,011
Anna?

1576
01:27:38,441 --> 01:27:39,681
Oh, Elsa.

1577
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:42,208
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1578
01:27:43,961 --> 01:27:45,372
I love you.

1579
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:50,243
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart. "

1580
01:27:51,841 --> 01:27:53,491
"Love Will thaw. "

1581
01:27:54,881 --> 01:27:57,361
Love. Of course.

1582
01:27:57,441 --> 01:27:58,522
Elsa?

1583
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:00,242
Love!

1584
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:48,492
I knew you could do it.

1585
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:52,243
Hands down,
this is the best day of my life.

1586
01:28:52,801 --> 01:28:54,690
And, quite possibly, the last.

1587
01:28:54,761 --> 01:28:57,082
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1588
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:59,051
Oh, Oh, Oh!

1589
01:29:01,161 --> 01:29:04,244
My own personal flurry!

1590
01:29:08,921 --> 01:29:10,571
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1591
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:14,642
Anna?

1592
01:29:14,961 --> 01:29:16,645
But she froze your heart.

1593
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:19,572
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1594
01:29:24,761 --> 01:29:26,525
Wonderful!

1595
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,006
Setting course, sir.

1596
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:46,648
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1597
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:50,562
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1598
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:52,406
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1599
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:54,131
This is unacceptable.

1600
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:57,325
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1601
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,165
Ah! My neck hurts.

1602
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:02,929
Is there a doctor that I could see?

1603
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,362
And I demand to see the queen!

1604
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:07,443
Oh. I have a message from the queen.

1605
01:30:08,081 --> 01:30:09,845
"Arendelle will henceforth and forever

1606
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:13,846
"no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown. "

1607
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,162
"Weselton. "

1608
01:30:15,241 --> 01:30:16,731
- it's Weselton!
Let's go.

1609
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:17,802
Come on, come on, come on!

1610
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:20,332
Okay, okay, here I come.

1611
01:30:20,401 --> 01:30:22,290
- Pole!
- Whoops! Sorry.

1612
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:24,012
Okay, Okay-

1613
01:30:24,241 --> 01:30:25,845
Here we are. Oh!

1614
01:30:28,241 --> 01:30:30,164
I owe you a sled.

1615
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:35,005
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1616
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:36,931
And it's the latest model.

1617
01:30:37,001 --> 01:30:38,526
No, I can't accept this.

1618
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:41,366
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1619
01:30:41,681 --> 01:30:45,322
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1620
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:47,450
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.

1621
01:30:47,521 --> 01:30:50,968
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1622
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:53,282
Like it? I love it!

1623
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:54,362
Whoa.

1624
01:30:54,441 --> 01:30:56,091
I could kiss you!

1625
01:30:57,001 --> 01:30:58,730
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...

1626
01:30:58,881 --> 01:31:00,929
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1627
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:02,128
Wait, what?

1628
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:04,367
We may.

1629
01:31:05,801 --> 01:31:07,690
Mmm.

1630
01:31:08,441 --> 01:31:09,727
Summer!

1631
01:31:11,441 --> 01:31:13,728
Ooh...

1632
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,803
Hello.

1633
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:33,162
Are you ready?

1634
01:31:38,921 --> 01:31:41,083
Ice!

1635
01:31:51,801 --> 01:31:53,405
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1636
01:31:53,481 --> 01:31:54,926
Swing me.

1637
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:57,605
Ooh...

1638
01:31:58,001 --> 01:31:59,685
I like the open gates.

1639
01:31:59,761 --> 01:32:01,923
We are never closing them again.

1640
01:32:04,641 --> 01:32:06,928
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1641
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:08,532
Come on! You can do it!

1642
01:32:08,961 --> 01:32:11,282
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1643
01:32:11,361 --> 01:32:13,045
I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it.

1644
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:14,122
Hey, guys!

1645
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:15,441
That's it, Olaf.

1646
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:18,764
Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot.

1647
01:32:18,841 --> 01:32:20,286
Go.

1648
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:45,202
Oh!
