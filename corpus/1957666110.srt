[upbeat music]

2
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:14,695
- [Cid] My name
 is El Cid Rivera.

3
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:17,180
And things are getting a
 little tight around here.

4
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,184
[jazzy music]

5
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:35,164
Like my friends,

6
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:38,236
I was born in this town and
 have lived here all my life.

7
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:39,651
We work.

8
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,479
We eat.

9
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,308
We sleep.

10
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:42,136
And after that,

11
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,344
we do it all some more.

12
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,003
But just to make sure nothing

13
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,419
exciting slips
 through the cracks,

14
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,249
me and the boys,

15
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:52,112
we compare notes,

16
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:53,941
regularly.

17
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:14,134
[group chatter]

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,139
- That was a game,
 that was a game.

19
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,040
- Another fucking Independence
 Day on our hands, huh.

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,836
Feeling independent?

21
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:27,802
- It's too hot out

22
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,321
to be independent.

23
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,048
- Not if you just stay in
 one place and don't move.

24
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,291
- Where else you gonna go

25
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,293
when you got it all right here?

26
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,536
- It's a no man's land
 outside this town.

27
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:38,882
- That's the key,
 Tully, stay here.

28
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,125
Just go nowhere.

29
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,472
- Cid, that's really
 not quite the spirit.

30
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,750
[laughter]

31
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,653
- Am I missing
 something, Chuckles?

32
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,311
Cause nothing I heard should
 be bringing the house down.

33
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,553
- [Chuckles] It just so
happens that I have--

34
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:55,934
- [Cid] A healthy friendship

35
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,419
needs a caring sense of give

36
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,696
and take.

37
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,353
You can say what's on your mind,

38
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,493
and no one goes home angry.

39
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,911
Chuckles probably
 knows that best.

40
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,500
These days, he's the
local apartment broker,

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,951
renting space to one and all.

42
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,436
- Look, don't say fire trap.

43
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,474
The word you're looking
 for to describe this place

44
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,130
is palace.

45
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,131
Repeat that.

46
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,029
Palace.

47
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:24,790
- [Cid] Tully there,

48
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,827
he's working on some
 business degree by day

49
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:29,588
while moonlighting
 to pay his way.

50
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:31,314
- Alright, let me
 get this straight.

51
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:32,902
You're gonna give
 me an extra 50 bucks

52
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:33,937
if I finish this guy off

53
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,353
with a swinging neck breaker?

54
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:38,908
Count me in.

55
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,772
- [Cid] Our local
 reverend over there,

56
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:43,878
Rev, takes tolls at
 the Midtown Tunnel.

57
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:46,364
He dropped out of
 the priesthood due to

58
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,745
personal habits
 he could not kick.

59
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,057
- I love chicks.

60
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:54,095
And the times I've truly
felt the presence of God

61
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:56,201
was when I was rolling
 around with a babe.

62
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,273
I need a drink.

63
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,585
- [Cid] And then

64
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:01,379
there's Eddie.

65
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,661
[laughter]

66
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,076
Sometimes I look at these guys

67
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:11,009
and I see the old
 men they're gonna be,

68
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:12,286
sitting at the same table,

69
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,701
swigging the same beer

70
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,669
until they're carted away.

71
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:16,911
- Look, look, today,

72
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:19,086
you let everybody else
clear out of this town,

73
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,881
leaving the place to yourself.

74
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,815
- Nothing going on
 outside this town anyway.

75
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,817
New York is tops.

76
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:26,714
- Yeah.

77
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:27,784
- I'll drink to that.

78
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,546
- But hey, these are
 my pals, the boys

79
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,444
hanging together
 through thick and thin

80
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:33,963
since grammar school,

81
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,723
day in, day out,

82
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,069
week after week,

83
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,140
year after year.

84
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,627
Currently in our
fourth decade together.

85
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:44,698
The way it ought to be.

86
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:53,845
[birds chirping]

87
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,649
The worst thing
 about a July Fourth

88
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,928
is that there is a July fifth

89
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,033
clamoring right in after it.

90
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,725
No room to breathe.

91
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,314
Time to get your bearings,

92
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,833
especially when you're
 trying to plant your flag

93
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,662
in this world.

94
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:30,537
I've always wanted to
 get up in the morning

95
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:31,952
with a sense of purpose.

96
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,680
And these days, I think
I'm on to something.

97
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,684
Life as a bounty hunter

98
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,617
is very compelling.

99
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:44,654
Mr. Flynn, this is
 Manhattan Electric and Gas.

100
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:49,659
You're bill of 129 dollars
 is now three months due.

101
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,869
Cough up the dough
 you little twerp.

102
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,526
Thanks so much.

103
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:57,426
Yeah that's right, 239
 dollars and 91 cents

104
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:58,461
or we

105
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,497
shut down your business.

106
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,361
Yes, you owe 43 dollars.

107
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,536
Now I can send someone around
 to kneecap you on Friday

108
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,537
if you're available.

109
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,057
Please, ma'am, I'm very busy.

110
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:10,093
No, it's a big job
 lighting the world.

111
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,474
Yes, Mrs. Bernstein,

112
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:14,132
my name is El Cid Rivera.

113
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:17,722
Well yes of course.

114
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, you were my ninth
grade science teacher.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,415
Wow, I thought you were dead.

116
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:26,696
No, I guess I never did
turn in that lab report.

117
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,804
Momentum equals

118
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,288
mass times velocity.

119
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,361
So you're saying
you're not paying until

120
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,189
I hand it in.

121
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,329
I see your point ma'am.

122
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,577
It wasn't long before my
 sense of dedication dwarfed

123
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:46,751
the mission at hand.

124
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,585
[upbeat music]

125
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:54,828
I've become what you
might call a journeyman,

126
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:57,037
applying my trade
 wherever it's needed

127
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:59,004
and moving on when
 the job is done.

128
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,075
But what would it be like

129
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:03,181
to be so good at one thing

130
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:06,322
that there's no question about
 what to do with your life?

131
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:08,358
Like playing the saxophone or

132
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,084
figure skating.

133
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,776
I could deal with
 the Ice Capades.

134
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:17,540
[speaking foreign language]

135
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:19,749
Hey fellas.

136
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:21,061
How you doing?

137
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:22,718
[speaking foreign language]

138
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,029
- Hey Cid.

139
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,688
[speaking foreign language]

140
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,357
Oh, that's right.

141
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:42,392
I forgot.

142
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:45,016
You don't speak Spanish.

143
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:48,709
[speaking foreign language]

144
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,024
I'll get it.

145
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,888
What can I get you?

146
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,890
- Actually, Jose, I just,

147
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,857
just want a cup of coffee.

148
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,928
- Cup of coffee,
coming right up.

149
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:04,587
[speaking foreign language]

150
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,075
You want milk with that?

151
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,525
- Yeah, please.

152
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:15,218
[speaking foreign language]

153
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,190
- [Cid] Some people
 draw a lot of strength

154
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,985
from their ethnic heritage.

155
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,366
It's that important
 sense of belonging.

156
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:28,922
My mother raised me
after we lost my father.

157
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,889
She spoke Spanish beautifully,

158
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,478
but with me, she'd
 only speak English.

159
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,723
She was going to raise
 a little American.

160
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:38,587
She said she wanted
 me to succeed

161
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:41,244
and didn't want me
speaking with an accent.

162
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:43,557
[speaking foreign language]

163
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,007
When maybe the thing I need most

164
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,215
is a little accent.

165
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:48,320
- Come on, yeah, that's it.

166
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,598
You got it.

167
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:50,702
El Gringo's coming out.

168
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:51,531
That's it.

169
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:53,912
Alright man, it looks good,

170
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,362
looks good brother, it
 looks really, really good.

171
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,676
[speaking foreign language]

172
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:01,541
- Hey, how about that
cup of coffee, you know?

173
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,234
[speaking foreign language]

174
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:27,601
- Take it.

175
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,809
- Yeah.

176
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,810
Thanks a lot fellas.

177
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,020
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
 whoa, wait a minute.

178
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,954
[speaking foreign language]

179
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:36,886
Dinero, remember.

180
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:38,819
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

181
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,821
Here you go, Jose.

182
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,443
Just keep the change.

183
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,791
Split it amongst
 yourselves, alright.

184
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,484
[speaking foreign language]

185
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,383
So long fellas.

186
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:55,042
[speaking foreign language]

187
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,783
- [Man] I can't
 believe this man.

188
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:12,957
[group chatter]

189
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,786
- [Man] He's the best.

190
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,651
- Hey, what's up?

191
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,514
- Hey, Cid.

192
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:19,688
- How you doing?

193
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:20,620
- Look, I don't care
 if the guy holds

194
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,000
a dick continental title belt,

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,726
he shouldn't go
 busting your glasses.

196
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:26,246
- Look, I laid in
 a couple of shots,

197
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:27,316
but then blackjack,

198
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,593
he whips me into the ring ropes

199
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,250
and bam, launches me skyward.

200
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,216
- It was beautiful.

201
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,977
- Where'd you land?

202
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:33,978
- [Tully] Third row.

203
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,151
Some fat guy and his fat family.

204
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,601
- Get to the punishing
 finish, Tully.

205
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,085
- Alright, so anyway,

206
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,847
Blackjack, he's got to improvise
some final move, right.

207
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,607
- And creative genius he is--

208
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,713
- Smacks me over the
head with a metal chair.

209
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,576
- Hence the alterations
in the glasses.

210
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:47,819
- What a closer.

211
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:50,477
- Hey, Blackjack is a
very gifted individual.

212
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,893
[door slams]

213
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,759
- When you wrestling again?

214
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,622
- Um,

215
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,142
Friday night.

216
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:02,523
My pal Jumbo requesting me
 for his title warmup match.

217
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,009
- Hello Chuckles,

218
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,631
Eddie.

219
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,701
- Hello, Geraldine.

220
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,564
- Tully,

221
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,807
Theodore.

222
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:14,018
- Rev, Officer
 Fusco, Rev will do.

223
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,882
- I'll make a note
 of that, Theodore.

224
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,681
- Why she gotta go and do that?

225
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,936
- Hey, Cid, you ever
 notice that Fusco

226
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:38,352
never mentions your name
when she says hello?

227
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,940
- Oh she knows him alright.

228
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,321
- Who could forget?

229
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,909
- What's that supposed to mean?

230
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,151
- It just means that ever since

231
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,394
you punched Geraldine
 Fusco in the mouth

232
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:46,844
in fourth grade,
 she's not forgotten.

233
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,329
- It's like she's got a
 score to settle or something.

234
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,711
- If I were you, I'd watch
 your ass at all times.

235
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,954
No, no, she patrols
 this neighborhood.

236
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:56,577
She's everywhere and nowhere
 when you least expect it.

237
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,821
- Yeah, and she packs that
 nine millimeter cannon

238
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:00,443
with a badge to back it up.

239
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,411
- You still think she
 remembers the fourth grade?

240
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,895
- It's fresh.

241
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,484
Still very fresh.

242
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:07,692
- It wasn't that bad.

243
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,625
- It all started with
 one very specific

244
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,109
dodge ball incident.

245
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,524
- Yeah, could we change
the subject please?

246
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,181
- [Rev] Yeah, yeah, let it be.

247
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:16,632
- No, she had to rub it in.

248
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:17,840
- No, no, drop it man.

249
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,048
- No, no, go on laughing boy.

250
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:19,877
Let's hear it.

251
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,984
- Well, Fusco struts up to Cid

252
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:25,468
and get this,

253
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,436
she says how you gonna
 play when no one wants you

254
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,369
on their fucking team?

255
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,612
[laughter]

256
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,892
- Yeah, well she
 was the first one

257
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:36,756
to use the word "fucking"
 in a complete sentence.

258
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,447
- No one wants you on
 their fucking team.

259
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:40,760
- Yeah, I'd a punched
 her lights out.

260
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,727
- I saw red and I swung.

261
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:43,728
I swung on her.

262
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,488
And the next thing I know,

263
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,525
I'm fist deep in molars.

264
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,906
- Cid,

265
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,183
I was wrong.

266
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,323
There's no way she's
 gotten over that.

267
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,290
- Hey, which tooth was it?

268
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,878
- Lower lateral incisor.

269
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:56,741
- Oh geeze.

270
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,915
Not that one.

271
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,124
- Cid, you got Geraldine
Fusco on your ass,

272
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,297
in perpetuity.

273
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:04,611
PS 109's greatest
dodge ball player ever.

274
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,820
- Track and field star.

275
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,787
- Olympic hopeful.

276
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,996
- Now she's bigger, faster,

277
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,238
stronger,

278
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:13,896
shaped by an elite law
 enforcement agency,

279
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:17,279
fueled by a blood
 thirsty need for revenge.

280
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,316
- [Chuckles] You are dead, Cid.

281
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,386
- [Eddie] Dead meat, pal.

282
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,872
- It was the fourth grade.

283
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:26,012
- Sure, that's
 the way to play it

284
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,359
when you're being stalked
 by a killing machine.

285
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,948
- You are dead, Cid.

286
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:32,328
- Yeah, I think we
 covered that Chuckles.

287
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,605
- [Tully] Poor bastard.

288
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,607
- Yeah.

289
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:44,064
I'd be lying if I said
 I enjoy being stalked.

290
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,859
Why the hell didn't
 my parents teach me

291
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,827
to stand up to this shit?

292
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,035
My father kicked the bucket,

293
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,588
and my mother dies too early,

294
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:54,143
and all I get is
 the name, El Cid.

295
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:55,938
El Cid Rivera.

296
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:58,320
But how can I blame
 my mother for it,

297
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,701
especially when it's
Charlton Heston's fault.

298
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:01,910
- [Mama] My Cid,

299
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,843
Charlton is a beautiful man.

300
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,121
A man who's been Michelangelo,

301
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,467
John the Baptist,

302
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,295
Ben Hur,

303
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,745
and Moses.

304
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,023
- [Cid] Yeah, well,
 Charlton finally had to go

305
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,404
and give her an epic hero

306
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,061
with a Spanish name.

307
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,235
1961, the big screen,

308
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,859
El Cid, the champion of Spain.

309
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,239
El Cid, [speaking
 foreign language].

310
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,795
Charlton wouldn't put up
with a Geraldine Fusco.

311
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:29,454
He'd go biblical and
 kick ass in sandals.

312
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,663
Why this name, mama?

313
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,355
Charlton's a god
 damned epic hero.

314
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,012
He united Spain
 for Christ's sake.

315
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,048
How the fuck am I supposed
 to compete with that?

316
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:39,188
- [Mama] Watch your
 tongue, my son.

317
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,672
Make mama proud

318
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,502
and concentrate on succeeding.

319
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:43,537
- [Cid] I can't, mama.

320
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,539
It's too late to be succeeding.

321
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,714
There's no one to triumph
 over at this hour.

322
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:49,750
- [Mama] Then get
 up bright and early

323
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,615
and begin succeeding my Cid.

324
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,341
- [Cid] I'll try mama.

325
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,351
[soft music]

326
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,399
- So what's up with
 Cid these days?

327
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,126
- Probably drank some
 bad hops or something.

328
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,922
He'll work it out on the road.

329
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,372
[soft music]

330
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:33,242
- You ask me, he's
better off going to bed.

331
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:38,178
- Nah, miles to go
 before he sleeps.

332
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,975
- [Cid] My name
 is El Cid Rivera,

333
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,223
and nighttime's my
 favorite time of day.

334
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,848
At this hour, the
 streets are your own,

335
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,332
waiting for you to take them

336
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:55,782
and make them into something.

337
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,543
[soft music]

338
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,097
- New York at night,

339
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,650
it's the best time of all.

340
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,308
It's when a blanket of
 sleep falls over this city.

341
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:07,000
I mean New York rejoins
the planet at night,

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,898
reclaimed by nature,

343
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:10,831
this city's rush hour pulse

344
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,488
turns to normal.

345
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,663
Now by day, this
 city's all revved up.

346
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:17,321
It's a marching
 band on the wack,

347
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:19,185
blaring and wailing,

348
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:21,014
a crush of sound and motion.

349
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,328
But by night, the
 bands gone home,

350
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:25,985
confused and tuckered out.

351
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,608
There's an opening up
 in the streets again.

352
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:31,404
And you know while
 most people sleep,

353
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,785
tucked away between
 comfy sheets,

354
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,962
we the nomads take
command of the streets.

355
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,999
Our tribe of nocturnal drifters

356
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,071
ride in this wide open city.

357
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:47,006
- What do they call us?

358
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,319
Not many people know we exist.

359
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,425
- Asphalt nomads.

360
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,254
That's what I call us.

361
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,600
- Asphalt nomads.

362
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,878
Blacktop rovers.

363
00:16:57,878 --> 00:16:59,432
- Peggy Fleming.

364
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,504
I call us Peggy Fleming.

365
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,747
- You can't just send
 in box tops to join,

366
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:07,578
you gotta keep something
this personal quite,

367
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,167
otherwise everybody wants in

368
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,582
and before you know it,

369
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:13,480
it's armature hour.

370
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,895
- Peggy Fleming.

371
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:17,381
- There's no secret hand
shake or grand poo bah,

372
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:19,969
you just put in here
 every once in a while,

373
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:21,626
catch up with friends,

374
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,111
be yourself.

375
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,354
We call it the Oasis.

376
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:26,700
- You're standing in it.

377
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,081
It's like a pit stop.

378
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,290
The Oasis.

379
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,740
- It's the one fixed point.

380
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,880
It's the one port
 of call for a nomad.

381
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,366
It's where paths,
 stories crisscross

382
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:39,161
in a night of a
 thousand journeys.

383
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:42,061
- You have over
 5,000 miles of road

384
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,408
in the five boroughs
 of New York City.

385
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:47,031
That is a lot of
 country to cover.

386
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,069
- 900 miles of road
 in Manhattan alone.

387
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,658
900 miles.

388
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,731
Why the hell you gonna
 go driving cross country?

389
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,664
You never have to
 leave this island.

390
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,252
- Peggy Fleming.

391
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,151
- This ain't your
 Hell's Angels or

392
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:05,325
lady's garden club.

393
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,464
Just by looking at the way

394
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:09,088
someone handles
themselves on the road,

395
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,330
you know who belongs.

396
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,747
[soft music]

397
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,653
- Hey, hey, Chuckles.

398
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,792
- Oh, hey, thanks
 for meeting me.

399
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:24,620
- Yeah.

400
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,313
- How do I explain this?

401
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:28,590
You know how I spent
 all my time downtown?

402
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,039
- Yeah.

403
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,110
- I always say that
 downtown's where it's at.

404
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
It's a total wasteland uptown.

405
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,596
- Yeah.

406
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:35,769
- Well there's this movie
 playing on 19th Street.

407
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:36,805
- Sounds good.

408
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:37,909
- No, it's not good.

409
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,290
It's not good at all.

410
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,912
You see, to get there I have to,

411
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,365
- What?

412
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,126
- I've never crossed 14th Street

413
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,128
in my life.

414
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,232
- [Cid] Wow.

415
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,923
Your own personal Berlin Wall.

416
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,132
- Let's face it Cid,

417
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,341
the world ends
 above 14th Street,

418
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:56,169
until now.

419
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,757
- Until this movie.

420
00:18:57,757 --> 00:18:59,862
Come on, it'll be easy.

421
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:02,141
- We're talking about
 14th Street here man.

422
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,556
Big dividing line
 on this island.

423
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,798
I cross this border,

424
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:06,041
and I'm breaking
 all my own rules.

425
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,767
- Hey, you got your
 ideals to uphold.

426
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:08,906
- I got a movie to see.

427
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,598
- I'll make the
 crossing with you.

428
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:12,944
- Okay,

429
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:13,773
you gotta shield
me along the way

430
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:14,636
so that no one spots me.

431
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,672
- Stand beside me man.

432
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,640
We are going to
 make the crossing.

433
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:23,162
[slow suspenseful music]

434
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,209
- Hey didn't you hear
me, you gotta shadow me.

435
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,452
- This is it.

436
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:38,556
We got a meeting
 on the other side.

437
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:41,249
- Hey, slow down.

438
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,974
- Spare me your lip man.

439
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:43,975
- Easy.

440
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,114
Easy.

441
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,806
[horns honking]

442
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:47,807
Easy.

443
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:48,808
- Use your fear.

444
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:49,809
use your fear.
 - Easy.

445
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:50,637
- Surging.

446
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:53,192
Hug the wall, hug the wall.

447
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,054
- What are you doing?

448
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:54,986
- Stay with me.

449
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:55,987
Stay with me, move, move, move.

450
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,230
The glorious must not rest

451
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,680
upon the laurels of
 their achievements.

452
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,958
- Let go of my arm you jerk.

453
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,098
- Oh hey, come on.

454
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:04,824
- I'm sure I've been spotted.

455
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,860
- Oh no, no, it's
 only a small crowd.

456
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,069
Come on, this is gonna
 bring us closer together,

457
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:10,036
you watch.

458
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,072
- Jerk.

459
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:35,613
[slow rock music]

460
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,391
- [Tully] Big day at work pal?

461
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:55,668
- The biggest.

462
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:56,634
- [Tully] You still
 at the stake pit?

463
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:58,360
- Jack's Steak Pit.

464
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,568
- How long have you been there?

465
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:00,500
- Three days tops.

466
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,122
- No, I'm deep into my fifth.

467
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:03,400
It's called commitment.

468
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,056
You should try it sometime.

469
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,161
- Ooh.

470
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:07,645
- You work the grill.

471
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:08,991
- No, see that's how it
 would look to you, Edward.

472
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,165
But it's not your fault.

473
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,098
When I signed on at Jack's,

474
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:13,824
I saw beyond the grill.

475
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:15,239
- You're standing at the grill.

476
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,380
- No, I've completely
 redefined the position, Tully.

477
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,450
- To what?

478
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,658
- Keeper

479
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:21,797
of the flame.

480
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,594
No, I've chosen to work

481
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:27,803
with the earth's
 most basic elements,

482
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,426
wind, water,

483
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:32,014
meat and fire.

484
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:34,776
Fire providing light and
warmth to earliest man.

485
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,950
Fire, which consumed Joan of Ark

486
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,987
and gutted Little
 Pete Topless in 1985.

487
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,851
- Little Pete, the poor bastard.

488
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:44,337
- Now it's my turn to
keep the flames in check

489
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,995
because somewhere between
 the slabs of T-bone

490
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:48,376
and the chopped chuck

491
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,205
hides that dancing flicker

492
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,587
that aims to take
 the whole place down.

493
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,179
- Cid, Cid,

494
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,388
crank the fucking flame down.

495
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:02,148
You're turning good meat
into hockey pucks man.

496
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,737
- Hey, I am harnessing flames
 for the good of people,

497
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,463
but you turn your
 back on 'em Jack.

498
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:08,154
- I ain't Jack!

499
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:10,984
The name's Stanley.

500
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,192
- What happened to Jack?

501
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,298
- Look, keep the dance low

502
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,300
and cut the Smokey
 the Bear shit.

503
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,543
- Alright.

504
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:20,408
The man is obviously not
in tune with my mission.

505
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,064
- Nor could you
 expect him to be.

506
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:26,275
- Get back.

507
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,794
The meat has got to breathe.

508
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:29,071
Back, damn you.

509
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,352
I am the master.

510
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,252
- Hey, hey, hey.

511
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:38,667
Hey, cut that shit out.

512
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,636
- I had to show the
 flames who was boss,

513
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:43,638
establish respect
 from the get go.

514
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:44,777
But I promise you next time--

515
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:46,123
- No, no, no, no.

516
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,367
There won't be a next time.

517
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,024
I'm busting your ass down to

518
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,405
salad bar.

519
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,751
- Oh man.

520
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,270
- Stay off the ladder.

521
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,168
Stay away from the
 fire extinguisher.

522
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,136
- Yeah, what if the
 flames get out of control?

523
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,171
- No, no, no, no, no, no,

524
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,414
if a fire breaks out,

525
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,520
you grab the lettuce

526
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,969
and haul ass out with me.

527
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:05,832
You got that loco?

528
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:06,661
- Yeah.

529
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:13,633
It's a setback.

530
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,324
It's nothing I can't handle.

531
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,637
- Sounds like they took you
 out of the play all together.

532
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:19,846
- Not before I saw the light.

533
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,330
They can't take that from me.

534
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,333
Staring deep into the flames,

535
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:28,614
I connected with the fire
 that roars deep inside myself

536
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,031
and I received my
 marching orders.

537
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:32,859
- To do what?

538
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,242
- I'm joining the
 fire department.

539
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:37,933
- The fire department?

540
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,107
- A union job is good.

541
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:40,349
- Yeah.

542
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:41,316
- You know how long it takes

543
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:42,248
to get into the fire department?

544
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:43,456
- Yeah, I stand ready, Chuckles.

545
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,768
Yesterday I actually
 applied for the exams.

546
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,390
- Pray for a fat envelope.

547
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,460
- [Cid] A what?

548
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,842
- A fat envelope.

549
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,188
My cousin did it.

550
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,914
At the end, they
 send you an envelope,

551
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,363
thin one says sorry sap,

552
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:55,537
you're rejected.

553
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:56,504
Fat one means
 they're sending you

554
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:57,539
the join the club booklets.

555
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,092
- Don't worry about envelopes.

556
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:01,232
- Hey, it's not like we're
 not supportive or anything,

557
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,717
it's just--

558
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:04,028
- Nah, it's just the day is
 let's be Surgeon General day,

559
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,720
tomorrow's French
 Foreign Legion day,

560
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,548
and Friday,

561
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:07,894
Friday is Fireman day.

562
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,206
- Why wait until Friday.

563
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,346
To El Cid,

564
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:13,279
the keeper of the flame.

565
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:16,213
- Yeah.

566
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:21,977
- I don't know about you,

567
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:22,702
I'm just stretching my arm.

568
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:26,119
[slow music]

569
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:40,237
- What does a nomad drive?

570
00:24:40,237 --> 00:24:43,067
Something that hugs
 a lane and a half,

571
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:45,345
guaranteeing a
 lions share respect.

572
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:47,209
- A car with heft.

573
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,902
Anything that
 weighs several tons.

574
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:52,249
- The cabbies
 bounce right off it.

575
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:53,284
Drives them crazy.

576
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:55,632
But what the cabbies gonna do?

577
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:57,910
You gonna need the coast
guard to haul me in.

578
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,843
- There what the
 uncultured laymen

579
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:01,879
might call a boat.

580
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,709
Say from the early to mid 70s,

581
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,711
the LTD,

582
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,126
the Marquis.

583
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,266
- You got your basic
 Lincoln Mark four,

584
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:12,752
or any of the early 70s
 continentals for that matter.

585
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:14,029
- Buick Lesaber,

586
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:16,238
the Electra 225,

587
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:17,585
the big cars.

588
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,518
The kind that say

589
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,485
I may not know where I'm going,

590
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:24,281
but you better
 believe I'm on my way.

591
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,454
- The Regency.

592
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:26,732
The Cutlass.

593
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:28,216
The Olds 88.

594
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,701
- These glorious tubs
are chariots, I tell ya.

595
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:33,324
A symbol of the last time

596
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,017
America was truly free.

597
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:38,295
- It's a kind of car
that a 30 miles an hour,

598
00:25:38,295 --> 00:25:40,262
you can take out
a telephone pole

599
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:41,781
without spilling your coffee.

600
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,644
- I tell you what, why don't
 we split the difference.

601
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,128
We'll call 12:15.

602
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:45,923
- That's a good point.

603
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:47,546
Hey, we should give Cid a call.

604
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,030
- Let it be.

605
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,720
[inaudible] out there
 driving around in circles.

606
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,136
[laughter]

607
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:53,413
- Lay off, that's his thing.

608
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:55,623
[laughter]

609
00:25:57,797 --> 00:26:00,213
[soft music]

610
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,565
- What do you want
 to know about El Cid?

611
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,566
- Rivera?

612
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,084
He's one of the greats.

613
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,879
- Cid River's got a
 few head problems.

614
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:13,572
But it doesn't seem
 to effect his driving.

615
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,503
- I love Cid,

616
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,851
but I hear he doesn't
 speak Spanish.

617
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,300
What's up with that?

618
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,647
How are you gonna express
 your passion to me?

619
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:21,580
- That Cid guy,

620
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,237
he ain't so hot.

621
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:25,894
He's a punk.

622
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:28,069
[speaking foreign language]

623
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:30,554
It's his car that makes
that guy anything.

624
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:31,555
I should know,

625
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,695
I sold it to him.

626
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:35,663
- I have no idea what
he does during the day,

627
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,873
but it's got to be something
 big, all that talent.

628
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:42,324
[upbeat music]

629
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:22,986
[traffic rumbling]

630
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:34,169
[group chatter]

631
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:39,554
- [Cid] Gotta stay in the open.

632
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,039
- For to be a--

633
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,179
- [Cid] She can't take me
 out if there are witnesses.

634
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:51,048
Play it cool.

635
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,879
Stay very cool.

636
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,193
Alright, fuck cool.

637
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,436
Run like hell.

638
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:32,676
- Well Rev, that's cause
we haven't done enough

639
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:34,022
grooming together lately.

640
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:39,890
Tonight, I was in the
 thick of a dynamite lather,

641
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,928
making love to the
 much overlooked scalp.

642
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:45,102
[laughter]

643
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:47,070
Creamer, conditioner,

644
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,729
and bring it on home
 with a towel dry.

645
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,937
- Wow.

646
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:53,593
- Cleanliness is
 next to godliness.

647
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,838
[soft music]

648
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:11,888
Is that right, Tully?

649
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,510
You like rolling
 around with fat guys

650
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,994
in spangled tights?

651
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:16,202
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

652
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:18,826
I'm part of a very proud
sporting tradition.

653
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,242
Playing high school gyms

654
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:22,864
and run down armories

655
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,279
with cigar chomping,

656
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,108
beer guzzling,

657
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:26,281
thugs at ringside.

658
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,282
- Tell 'em Tully.

659
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:28,801
- Am I rolling at all?

660
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,803
Wrestlers come to me

661
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,218
to improve their records.

662
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:33,702
You see I'm the booster.

663
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,428
I send contenders to the top.

664
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:36,671
Nothing like it.

665
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:39,605
The beauty of 300
 pound bodies soaring

666
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,158
high in the air,

667
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,642
colliding,

668
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:44,299
without a scratch.

669
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,404
Huge bodies

670
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:47,061
never meant to fly

671
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,890
spinning like ballerinas.

672
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:51,755
- [Mama] Cid, El Cid.

673
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,034
- [Cid] Yes mama.

674
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:57,761
- [Mama] El Cid,
 are you succeeding?

675
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,625
- Dammit mama,

676
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,833
you made me miss a light.

677
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm on the trail
 of a perfect ride

678
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,148
and you go block my flow.

679
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:08,185
- [Mama] You can flow
 tomorrow, my precious one.

680
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,946
How are you going
 to make mama proud

681
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:12,638
with your ass
 planted in that car?

682
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,019
- I'm just relaxing out here.

683
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,537
- [Mama] When are
 you going to become

684
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:17,125
mama's little lawyer?

685
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,748
- Mama, the world isn't
the way you remember it.

686
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:21,336
Everyone hates lawyers today.

687
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:23,200
- [Mama] But you are my Cid.

688
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,894
People will love when you
because a Supreme Court Justice.

689
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:29,275
- Yeah, I'll get right
 on that tomorrow.

690
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:31,346
- I like your idea about
being a booster, Tully.

691
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,935
I'm kind of a booster myself.

692
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:35,868
- Oh, geeze.

693
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,975
- Hey, I actively
 support this community

694
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:41,805
by settling good people
in our humble town.

695
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:44,359
- Now look, I'm not
renting this fire trap.

696
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,913
It's a goddamn hole.

697
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:49,157
- Everybody's got a place
 in this town cause of me.

698
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,850
I keep things flowing.

699
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,472
- Flow.

700
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:54,887
You're gonna talk about flow.

701
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,958
- [Chuckles] That's just
what transpired, Rev.

702
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,478
- Well it's just that
 I'm the holy man of flow.

703
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:01,756
- Yeah, flowed right
 out of the priesthood.

704
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:02,895
[laughter]

705
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,414
- And into a tollbooth
 where I belong.

706
00:31:04,414 --> 00:31:08,452
I was called to take tolls at
 the Queens' Midtown Tunnel.

707
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,799
- One of God's more
 mysterious plans, huh.

708
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,318
- Almost biblical, Eddie,

709
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:14,182
cause now I'm the gate keeper.

710
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:15,943
I mean let the priest
 help the faithful

711
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,082
in the gates of Heaven.

712
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:19,153
If you want in in this town,

713
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,602
you come to me

714
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,364
and you pay the price.

715
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,953
If I don't deem you worthy,

716
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,540
I pull the alarm,

717
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,817
like you're trying
 to beat the toll

718
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:31,544
and the cops swarm
 all over your ass,

719
00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:32,787
tying you up in bullshit.

720
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:35,031
Meanwhile, I take a powder

721
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:37,033
and a very well
 timed coffee break.

722
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:37,896
- Wow.

723
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,762

724
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,144

 of the perfect ride,

00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,876
keeping my sweeps wide,

728
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,051
keeping my turns tight,

729
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,880
hoping to come
 around fast enough

730
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,883
so that I might catch
 a glimpse of myself.

731
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:03,887
- Do you know what
 it's like to float

732
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:07,408
to Third Avenue at
 seven miles an hour?

733
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,479
To own Fifth Avenue?

734
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,825
To take Sixth Avenue

735
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:12,413
and all its six lane glory,

736
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:14,587
massaging blacktop
 that's usually

737
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:15,968
choked by traffic.

738
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,797
- Graceful moves,

739
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:19,351
floating arcs,

740
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,697
rolling through this town

741
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:21,870
like a magic carpet.

742
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:25,012
- Going nowhere fast.

743
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,255
- Just going.

744
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:29,464
- Just getting out and going.

745
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:31,846
The sheer power

746
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,503
of going.

747
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:35,815
- Never getting lost.

748
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:37,886
Hey, you're bounded by rivers.

749
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:40,337
You can only go so far
 before you hit water.

750
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:41,960
- Midnight to 5:30.

751
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,306
- I have to let him in,

752
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:45,308
but before Good Morning America.

753
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:46,378
- Late at night

754
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:48,035
when midnight strikes.

755
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,623
It's when the nomads
 take back the city,

756
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:51,866
blazing trails

757
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,937
and making waves and

758
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,629
leaving behind a chain
 city in our wake.

759
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:13,129
[slow music]

760
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:19,928
- You know--

761
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:22,931
[suspenseful music]

762
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:45,782
Whoa.

763
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:48,785
[suspenseful music]

764
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:58,243
Okay, okay, say you got me.

765
00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,554
You got me.

766
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:00,762
Sure, more than 22
 years have passed

767
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:02,143
since I assaulted you
 on the playground,

768
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:03,006
but you know,

769
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,214
a tooth's a tooth.

770
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:05,457
So go ahead.

771
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,390
Apply excessive force
 or whatever's evoked

772
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,874
down at the station house.

773
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:10,738
Wield your sword of justice.

774
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:11,704
Take it to me, woman.

775
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:12,981
Mend my ways.

776
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,019
Hello up there.

777
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,470
- Yeah.

778
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,092
- Yeah, could we get the
 beating underway, please?

779
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,060
- Well I'm not sure what to do.

780
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,510
- Well, they must have covered
 this down at the academy.

781
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,029
I mean--

782
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:26,685
- It's just that I've been
 waiting for this moment

783
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,135
for so long, I,

784
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:29,136
I never imagined--

785
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:30,344
- Imagined what?

786
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:31,138
- I never thought about
what I'd actually do

787
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,000
when I got to it.

788
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,829
- Okay.

789
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,417
How about we,

790
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,040
we skip the bruising and
 we move straight into some

791
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,731
low intensity shoving?

792
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:43,391
- Would you like to
 go to dinner sometime?

793
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:44,634
- Ah,

794
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,084
I'm gonna repeat what
I just heard, because--

795
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,396
- I'm asking you if you'd
 like to go to dinner.

796
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:52,849
- Sure, why not.

797
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:53,781
- Oh that's great.

798
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,094
That's really great.

799
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,407
- You're not pissed
 about the tooth?

800
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,029
- Not as much anymore.

801
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:03,480
- Oh good, that's a
weight off my shoulders.

802
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,688
- Wow.

803
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,034
This really does feel good.

804
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:08,106
- Yeah, everything
 out in the open.

805
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,831
- And speaking your feelings.

806
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:12,110
- So when you want
 to get together?

807
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,352
- How about Friday night?

808
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:17,322
You know that I've liked
 you for such a long time,

809
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:18,599
I just

810
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,497
didn't know how to show you.

811
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:21,291
- Here we are.

812
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:25,123
- You always had that cute
 wayward look about you.

813
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,229
- I bet you say that
 to all your callers.

814
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:31,612
- So, Friday night.

815
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,903
[jazzy music]

816
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,701
- [Cid] My name
 is El Cid Rivera.

817
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:54,842
Today will be different.

818
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:58,811
Today I am dressed for success.

819
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:01,020
Clad in the footwear
 of champions,

820
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,333
I will walk the
 walk of Charlton,

821
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,714
endorsed by Moses,

822
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:07,165
torture tested by Ben Hur,

823
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,684
these babies send a message.

824
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:10,651
I will show all

825
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,825
that I am serious.

826
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:16,381
Big things happen
 in these shoes.

827
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:22,939
[traffic rumbling]

828
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,332
[group chatter]

829
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:37,643
- Okay, one more.

830
00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:38,644
- One more,

831
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:39,645
on the floor.

832
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:40,646
On the floor.

833
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:42,200
- Oh, that's mine.

834
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,442
That's my scene.

835
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:44,926
If I can keep working my moves,

836
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:46,100
then I'm happy.

837
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,929
- You just keep doing
 what your doing.

838
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:48,896
- That's right.

839
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:50,173
- And that's enough.

840
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,486
- Oh, come on, Cid.

841
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:54,488
Nothing's ever enough
 for you, is it?

842
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:55,730
- No, it's not.

843
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,007
- [Eddie] What the
 hell is it you want?

844
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,216
- I want to feel like

845
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,734
I'm part of something
 bigger than myself.

846
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:01,219
- [Tully] So join something.

847
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,461
- Join where, Tully?

848
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,325
All the big causes
 have already happened.

849
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,878
- Hey, keep hanging out with us

850
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:07,363
and you'll make history, eh.

851
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:09,227
- How are we making
 history here?

852
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:11,919
- I think you're
 struggling too hard.

853
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,161
- Cid,

854
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,888
there's no room today
 for the epic hero.

855
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:18,236
Epic gets in the way.

856
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,617
Now you go to pull some
miracle on 14th Street,

857
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,274
you'll tie up traffic,

858
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,551
fuck up the whole city.

859
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:26,589
[laughter]

860
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:29,177
- Clearly you guys
 don't understand.

861
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,351
- Hey,

862
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:31,904
the greats are
 always misunderstood.

863
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:32,905
- Yeah.

864
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:34,735
- Hey, see you tomorrow night.

865
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,462
- Same time,

866
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:39,257
same place,

867
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,327
same pals.

868
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,162
- Give me the quarter.

869
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:50,198
- Right, reverential one,

870
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:51,579
here you go.
 - Let me see that one.

871
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,274
[slow jazzy music]

872
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:57,093
- [Cid] When all else fails,

873
00:38:57,093 --> 00:38:58,646
count on gravity.

874
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,823
Once you're on the floor,

875
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,480
you can't fall any further.

876
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,759
Things get to be
 too much up there,

877
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,554
take the hit,

878
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:10,451
hit the deck.

879
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,212
And when the dust clears,

880
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:14,938
you try getting to your knees.

881
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,254
You make your stand again.

882
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:25,293
On the floor, it's
 only up from here.

883
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:51,906
- Hey Cid,

884
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:55,047
I came as fast as I could.

885
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:56,532
- Really, thanks for meeting me.

886
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,982
- Hey, you were there for
 me on 14th Street, you know.

887
00:39:58,982 --> 00:39:59,845
Not that you helped much,

888
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:00,812
but you were there.

889
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,710
- Chuckles, I've come

890
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:05,851
to a very important decision,

891
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,266
but I have to know

892
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:08,854
that I can trust you.

893
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:10,097
- Who else you gonna trust?

894
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:13,480
- I've decided that I must lead.

895
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,171
- You don't have
 to go anywhere pal.

896
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:15,999
- No, lead.

897
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,760
I must lead.

898
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:21,177
But before I do, I must
ask a special favor.

899
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:23,248
- Yes, my Cid.

900
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,595
- If I should die,
 these are my writings.

901
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:27,528
- Hey, I didn't know you wrote.

902
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:29,150
You talked about
 writing, but I never

903
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,773
figured you'd do
 anything about it.

904
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:31,981
- No, no I write,

905
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:33,154
you know, when I have
 something to say,

906
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:34,362
I write.

907
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:35,191
- Okay.

908
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,194
- If I should die,

909
00:40:38,194 --> 00:40:39,506
take the word to my people.

910
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,473
- Who are your people?

911
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:44,027
- I don't know.

912
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,581
- Huh.

913
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:46,547
- And they don't know either.

914
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:50,448
My people are called
 those who don't know,

915
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,759
and they know who they are.

916
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:53,554
- What's this again?

917
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:54,417
- My writings,

918
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,280
my tome,

919
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,282
the word.

920
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,526
[laughter]

921
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:00,527
- The word?

922
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:02,011
- Laugh not chuckling one.

923
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:03,461
If I should not return
 safely to my home tonight,

924
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,290
you must take the word

925
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,430
and bring it to my people

926
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,983
and let them carry on.

927
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:13,125
Bankers who don't want to bank,

928
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:13,919
but do.

929
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:17,682
Software engineers who
 want to design cities,

930
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,166
but don't.

931
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,616
Old timers

932
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:23,204
tortured by
 opportunities not seized.

933
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:25,483
Waiters wanting out.

934
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,383
Temps seeking permanence.

935
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:31,627
These are people wanting change

936
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,283
but they know not

937
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,182
where or how to do it.

938
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,978
These are my people.

939
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,741
- All this is in here?

940
00:41:45,226 --> 00:41:46,262
- It will be,

941
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:47,263
as soon as I know what to say.

942
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,160
Don't rush me, Chuckles.

943
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,509
- I better get going.

944
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,166
My beeper just went off, and I--

945
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,203
- You don't carry a beeper.

946
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:57,169
- No, I do now.

947
00:41:57,169 --> 00:41:58,585
- Oh well then, off you go.

948
00:41:58,585 --> 00:41:59,931
- Yes, my Cid.

949
00:42:20,192 --> 00:42:21,608
[soft music]

950
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,713
- [Cid] Geraldine Fusco,

951
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:26,026
what a babe.

952
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,268
At first glance,

953
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:29,236
a volatile girl with
 the stopping power

954
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:31,549
of a small battalion.

955
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,275
But now, now she's
 just so much more

956
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:36,519
than a terminator to me.

957
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,176
My sweet Geraldine,

958
00:42:38,176 --> 00:42:40,212
she wakes up in the morning

959
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:42,560
and knows exactly which
way she's heading.

960
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,216
Sturdy steel shanked boots,

961
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:45,701
thighs of an olympian

962
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:48,669
sheathed in a striking
 poly cotton blend.

963
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,982
And check out the chest,

964
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:54,675
the arms all at once
 capable of a loving embrace,

965
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:58,092
or a crippling submission hold.

966
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,992
And oh, that angel's face.

967
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:03,960
All with a smile that
 bathes you in light

968
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,755
and reassures you it's not you

969
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:08,378
she'll be tossing into
 the back of the squad car.

970
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,484
And every man's dream,

971
00:43:10,484 --> 00:43:14,005
a woman with a bat utility belt.

972
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:17,318
Imagine the adventures.

973
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:20,494
This relationship could
have real possibilities.

974
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,532
- [Eddie] Dipping and dodging.

975
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:25,810
- Dipping and dodging,
 right Chuckles?

976
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,397
[laughter]

977
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,398
- Yeah, right.

978
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,607
Dipping and dodging.

979
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,194
I know what dipping
 and dodging is.

980
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:32,126
- [Rev] You know what it is?

981
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,058
- [Chuckles] I've always known.

982
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:34,612
- Boys.

983
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,543
I've been thinking.

984
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:36,441
- And what's that?

985
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,444
- Well I'd kind of
 like to switch chairs.

986
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:46,071
- Now why would you want
to do a thing like that?

987
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:49,488
- Well, it'd shake up
 the perspective a little.

988
00:43:49,488 --> 00:43:50,731
Well Chuckles here,

989
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,388
he's got the perfect
 view of the windows.

990
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:54,459
And Rev, he gets the
 chicks at the door.

991
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:56,047
And me, I'm tired
 of looking at our

992
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:57,635
ravaging barkeep, Leo.

993
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:00,914
- Now you're mine.

994
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:01,846
- Look, Tully,

995
00:44:01,846 --> 00:44:03,364
that's all fine and good, but a,

996
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:05,712
this is the way it's been

997
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:06,747
for years.

998
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,266
- I vote no.

999
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:09,750
- Look, Tully, people are
 accustomed to seeing me

1000
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,682
in this chair.

1001
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:14,168
Now if we suddenly change seats,

1002
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:15,514
they may see you,

1003
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:17,240
which could upset them.

1004
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,966
I don't want those people upset.

1005
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:21,279
- So stay where you are, Edward.

1006
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:22,763
Maybe me and
 Chuckles can switch.

1007
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:23,937
Hey Chuckles,

1008
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:25,007
you'd like it over here.

1009
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:26,456
- Fat chance.

1010
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:27,423
Look Tully,

1011
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:29,390
you just don't go swapping--

1012
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,323
- [Cid] It's funny, isn't it?

1013
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:33,015
Romance blossoms in ways

1014
00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:34,948
you never see coming.

1015
00:44:34,948 --> 00:44:36,225
Me and Geraldine,

1016
00:44:36,225 --> 00:44:39,573
our courtship was
 fast and furious.

1017
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:41,437
We could while away the hours,

1018
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:44,682
reliving the magic of our
 first romantic encounters.

1019
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,270
Day by day, our feelings grew.

1020
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,859
She loved it when
 I resisted arrest.

1021
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,689
She loved it even more

1022
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,414
when I watched her in action.

1023
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:55,106
- Book 'em honey.

1024
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:56,590
- I said spread 'em, fuckwad.

1025
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:59,904
So, are we still on
 for Wednesday night?

1026
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:01,215
- You got it baby.

1027
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:03,252
My Geraldine was alive.

1028
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:06,911
By day, she walked a
 world of heightened drama.

1029
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:11,294
By night, officer Fusco
took my world by storm.

1030
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,712
We could talk about
 anything from sex

1031
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,092
to capital punishment,

1032
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,957
to troop strength
 in Latin America.

1033
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:20,407
I had dreams.

1034
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:21,822
She had dreams.

1035
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:24,894
I'd like to lead a nation or

1036
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:26,275
join the fire department,

1037
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:29,278
be a figure skater.

1038
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,351
- Ever since I
 was a little girl,

1039
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:35,733
I've always dreamed of
becoming a Texas Ranger.

1040
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,289
Oh, you got to be one
 tough bitch for that.

1041
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,017
- That's so nice.

1042
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:46,640
The fact was, we connected.

1043
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,505
She knew where the
lines were drawn and I,

1044
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,507
I have always been
 a big fan of lines.

1045
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:54,786
- So you want me to
 start it up killer?

1046
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:55,960
Is that what you want?

1047
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,101
- Yeah, baby, that'd be great.

1048
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,309
And my Geraldine,

1049
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,656
only my tender Geraldine,

1050
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,623
could turn the Miranda

1051
00:46:04,623 --> 00:46:08,558
into a passionate act of love.

1052
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,491
- You have the right
 to remain silent.

1053
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:12,390
Anything you say,

1054
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,529
see,

1055
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:14,357
and feel

1056
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,360
can and will be
 held against you.

1057
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:20,916
[soft music]

1058
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,957
- [Cid] That was order
 in the world again.

1059
00:46:27,957 --> 00:46:30,097
I was dating the rule book.

1060
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:32,962
And it's name was
 Geraldine Fusco.

1061
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:34,619
- You just don't go

1062
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,103
swapping seats.

1063
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:38,140
- What we got here is kind
 of like Meet the Press.

1064
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,245
You don't see them
 swapping seats.

1065
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:41,281
- Isn't that right Cid?

1066
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:43,801
- Oh you got it baby.

1067
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:52,188
[soft music]

1068
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:53,880
- Ray's the night.

1069
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,157
And at night,

1070
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:57,504
Ray holds sway.

1071
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,508
By day, my time is their time,

1072
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:03,268
boss bitching at me,

1073
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:05,132
family riding my ass,

1074
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:07,583
pressures that would
 kill the ordinary mortal.

1075
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,930
But at night,

1076
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,483
it's Ray's road.

1077
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,866
And I will this car

1078
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:17,696
like a sword,

1079
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:21,079
slicing through the
 night with a steady hand.

1080
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,633
Oh come closer taxi cab,

1081
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,877
I beckon thee.

1082
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,811
Cross my path so I may

1083
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:30,088
broadside thee.

1084
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:33,333
Feel my girth.

1085
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,128
Taste my essence.

1086
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:37,440
Back the fuck off

1087
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:40,443
cause it's Ray's road tonight.

1088
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:42,618
And I'll release it

1089
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:45,655
as fast as I can
 pump the accelerator

1090
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:46,829
and make higher ground.

1091
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:49,452
It's all so

1092
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,938
Ray.

1093
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,805
- [Mama] Cid, El Cid.

1094
00:47:58,668 --> 00:47:59,980
- [Cid] Yes mama.

1095
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,293
- [Mama] Are you
 ready to talk now?

1096
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:03,811
- [Cid] Yes mama.

1097
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:04,640
- [Mama] El Cid,

1098
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,090
are you succeeding?

1099
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,677
- [Cid] I'm trying mama.

1100
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:10,128
- [Mama] Is this why
 I slaved day and night

1101
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:11,578
so that you could become some

1102
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:14,236
night riding [speaking
 foreign language]?

1103
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:15,064
[speaking foreign language]

1104
00:48:15,064 --> 00:48:15,893
Clown.

1105
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,584
Night riding clown.

1106
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:19,482
Repeat that back for mama.

1107
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:20,414
- Mama.

1108
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:22,278
- [Mama] Yes, my beautiful one.

1109
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:23,279
- I can't do this now.

1110
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,143
I'm gonna crash the car.

1111
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:26,386
- [Mama] Well,

1112
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:28,146
you go park it and
 I'll come back.

1113
00:48:28,146 --> 00:48:29,941
- Whatever, mama.

1114
00:48:37,293 --> 00:48:40,262
While all was not perfect
 on the career front,

1115
00:48:40,262 --> 00:48:42,609
I was learning to
 strike a balance.

1116
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:45,508
Life with Geraldine was
 getting better and better.

1117
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:47,579
She helped me get in
touch with my feelings,

1118
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,514
and she was right there
 to help me sort them out.

1119
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,378
- Who is in charge?

1120
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:54,828
- Come on, lay off.

1121
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:57,693
- Answer the question.

1122
00:48:57,693 --> 00:48:58,763
Who's in control?

1123
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,351
- Would you get the hell off.

1124
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,455
I run the show, dammit.

1125
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,872
- Wrong answer, fuckwad.

1126
00:49:04,872 --> 00:49:07,703
Now, I want to hear your
true feelings for me.

1127
00:49:07,703 --> 00:49:09,739
- Get the fuck off me, Fusco.

1128
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,948
- Who do you love?

1129
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,019
- You're breaking my arm, Fusco.

1130
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,986
- I'll snap it
 right off, Rivera.

1131
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,677
Now who's in love?

1132
00:49:16,677 --> 00:49:18,956
- You gotta be fucking kidding.

1133
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,993
- Do you see me smiling, boy?

1134
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:23,615
Huh?

1135
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:25,203
So say it.

1136
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:26,791
Love, right.

1137
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:27,619
Love.

1138
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:28,862
- Alright, alright,

1139
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:31,347
I have feelings and

1140
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:33,798
I call it like.

1141
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:34,972
- You what?

1142
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,456
- I'm in like with
 you, you know.

1143
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:40,287
We got a really strong
 like on our hands, pookey.

1144
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,946
- It's a tough world out there,

1145
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:46,707
and you and I are not
 gonna make it on like.

1146
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:47,915
So say it.

1147
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:49,020
Love.

1148
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,747
- I've never felt like

1149
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:53,887
like this before.

1150
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:58,754
- Alright.

1151
00:49:58,754 --> 00:49:59,720
That'll do for now.

1152
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,619
You're free to go.

1153
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,517
- It's my fucking place.

1154
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:05,450
- Okay, at ease then.

1155
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,008
Look, sometimes I get caught
 up in the heat of the moment.

1156
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,113
My adrenaline starts pumping

1157
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:15,115
and boom, my head explodes.

1158
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:18,325
It's got to be the
 academy training.

1159
00:50:20,362 --> 00:50:22,881
- What we got is
 special, Geraldine.

1160
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,093
[soft music]

1161
00:50:27,093 --> 00:50:28,301
With every moment,

1162
00:50:28,301 --> 00:50:30,027
I believed even
 more strongly in us.

1163
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:39,105
Here was a woman willing
to fight for love.

1164
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:41,590
And I, El Cid Rivera,

1165
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,247
was part of the struggle.

1166
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:50,564
- The streaming of
 light and sound,

1167
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:54,154
she goes and goes
 like a river flows,

1168
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:55,638
like the mighty Mississippi.

1169
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,503
Broadway's a river,

1170
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:00,195
as great as any of
 the American greats.

1171
00:51:00,195 --> 00:51:02,714
The Hudson, the Ohio,

1172
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:04,647
the Colorado,

1173
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,787
flowing down Manhattan Island,

1174
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:09,066
landing at the battery,

1175
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,274
emptying to the sea.

1176
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:14,071
This mighty river of black top

1177
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,004
transverses this
phrenetic strip of rock,

1178
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:18,972
a giant brace for a city

1179
00:51:18,972 --> 00:51:20,215
that might

1180
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:22,113
otherwise spin out of control,

1181
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:24,874
fed by tributaries,

1182
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:25,875
feeding neighborhoods,

1183
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,532
connecting all.

1184
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:30,017
Broadway is the mighty carrier

1185
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,985
rolling through the
 plains of Harlem

1186
00:51:31,985 --> 00:51:33,883
and the canyons of Midtown

1187
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:37,094
down through the un-tamable
 lands of Greenwich Village.

1188
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:39,889
Broadway,

1189
00:51:40,787 --> 00:51:44,308
carrying the city on it's back,

1190
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:45,447
dropping off,

1191
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,000
picking up,

1192
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,382
breathing in and
 out at it's banks.

1193
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,937
If asked,

1194
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:55,664
I'd say that I
 like Broadway best

1195
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:58,563
in the thick of night

1196
00:51:58,563 --> 00:52:00,047
when it's waters are darkest,

1197
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,705
blacktop beckoning,

1198
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:06,502
opening up wide and
 promising mysteries.

1199
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,264
I answer the call.

1200
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:10,472
I push off.

1201
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,132
And I pilot my Grand
 Marquis downstream.

1202
00:52:16,374 --> 00:52:18,100
I steer but

1203
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,446
in its grip,

1204
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:21,621
I surrender to the current,

1205
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:24,520
riding high,

1206
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,108
letting go.

1207
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:28,006
And it's goes

1208
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:30,181
and goes.

1209
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,046
Broadway.

1210
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:36,083
Mighty as the Mississippi,

1211
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:37,568
mysterious as the Nile

1212
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:40,329
and hallowed as the Ganges.

1213
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,574
Keeper of the nomad faith,

1214
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:47,060
lifeblood of the perfect ride.

1215
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:00,660
- Clear.

1216
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,109
Yes,

1217
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:03,041
all clear.

1218
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:09,151
[traffic rushing]

1219
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:12,085
[slow jazzy music]

1220
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:16,158
- You keep saying
 that word fire trap,

1221
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:19,472
and it's really
 beginning to bug me.

1222
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:22,199
- [Cid] Your runway,
 increase throttle.

1223
00:53:26,893 --> 00:53:28,135
- The work of God is this,

1224
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:30,068
to believe in the
 one he has sent.

1225
00:53:30,068 --> 00:53:31,829
Enter my gates.

1226
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:33,037
- Ready.

1227
00:53:33,037 --> 00:53:34,211
Oh yes.

1228
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,902
Prepare for takeoff.

1229
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:37,904
- Oh yeah.

1230
00:53:37,904 --> 00:53:39,077
Love it.

1231
00:53:39,077 --> 00:53:40,907
Love the do.

1232
00:53:40,907 --> 00:53:43,461
[upbeat music]

1233
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:58,959
We're breaking out,
 we're lifting off.

1234
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,929
[wind blowing]

1235
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,763
[metal crashing]

1236
00:54:31,544 --> 00:54:32,648
[knock on door]

1237
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:34,029
It's open, come on in.

1238
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,723
- I'm not bothering you, am I?

1239
00:54:38,723 --> 00:54:41,864
- No, no, no, definitely not.

1240
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:44,108
[laughter]

1241
00:54:45,627 --> 00:54:48,077
- Cid, I just had
 to talk to you.

1242
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,287
I can't believe it.

1243
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,289
I can't believe all
this is happening to me.

1244
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,945
- Yeah, well I'm happy too.

1245
00:54:53,945 --> 00:54:55,153
You shout it to the world.

1246
00:54:55,153 --> 00:54:56,569
We're an item pookey.

1247
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:58,364
- That too.

1248
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:01,781
But what I'm talking
 about is this letter.

1249
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:03,507
It just came in the mail today.

1250
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:07,373
- Well the postal service
 is wonderful, honey.

1251
00:55:07,373 --> 00:55:08,753
It's something we
should all be proud of.

1252
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:10,237
- Cid.

1253
00:55:10,237 --> 00:55:12,205
I've been accepted.

1254
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:13,965
- Accepted to what?

1255
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:16,865
- I am going to be

1256
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:18,487
a Texas Ranger.

1257
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:19,730
- A Texas Ranger?

1258
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,179
How you gonna pull
 that off from here?

1259
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:22,836
- You knucklehead,

1260
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,838
I'm gonna be a Texas Ranger

1261
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:26,806
in Texas.

1262
00:55:27,979 --> 00:55:30,465
I've had the application
in for over two years.

1263
00:55:30,465 --> 00:55:33,433
- I thought you were just
 talking about your dream.

1264
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:36,678
- Yeah, but why talk
 about it when I can do it?

1265
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:38,024
- Because talking's enough.

1266
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:40,647
There's less chance
 of getting injured.

1267
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:41,890
- Oh Cid,

1268
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,961
when I first started
 to think about Texas--

1269
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:45,963
- [Cid] This isn't happening.

1270
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:47,620
I'm alone again.

1271
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,036
I'm facing the
 world alone again.

1272
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:52,314
Man does this suck.

1273
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:54,143
- But think about it Cid.

1274
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:58,182
Me in Texas bagging
 chain saw murderers.

1275
00:55:58,182 --> 00:56:00,495
- God, how can she
throw away what we have?

1276
00:56:00,495 --> 00:56:01,323
Alright, steady now.

1277
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:02,945
Steady.

1278
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:04,222
Just check to see if she's
 still using that word leaving.

1279
00:56:04,222 --> 00:56:06,466
- Do you know they don't wait?

1280
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:08,882
So I'll be leaving next Tuesday.

1281
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,677
- Oh God Dammit! There it is.

1282
00:56:10,677 --> 00:56:12,369
- I know this is sudden

1283
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,784
and it's really
 gonna be hard for me

1284
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:14,888
to say goodbye to you, but--

1285
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:16,131
- Oh just wrap it up,

1286
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:17,304
wrap it up baby,

1287
00:56:17,304 --> 00:56:19,893
you're ruining my life.

1288
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:21,619
Oh, she's got to stop
 talking sometime,

1289
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,311
her mouth is just
 gonna seize up.

1290
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,348
- So, I've got to.

1291
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:27,694
- Oh goddammit,
 please don't say it.

1292
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:28,971
Please don't say it.

1293
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:30,939
- I mean, I've got to.

1294
00:56:30,939 --> 00:56:32,699
- Incoming boy, take cover.

1295
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:36,703
- Cid, we've got
to break it off.

1296
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:39,223
- [Cid] Oh goddammit,
 there it is.

1297
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:41,708
This is not happening.

1298
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,469
She's, she's emotional.

1299
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:45,471
She's deranged.

1300
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:47,162
- Wow.

1301
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:49,026
You're so composed.

1302
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:54,065
Obviously, this
 isn't effecting you

1303
00:56:54,065 --> 00:56:55,515
like it's hurting me.

1304
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:56,965
- [Cid] Just pray for
 the building to collapse.

1305
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:58,725
A year in traction
 will bring her around.

1306
00:56:58,725 --> 00:57:01,176
- Man, I'm beat.

1307
00:57:01,176 --> 00:57:02,833
I think I'm gonna
 be heading home.

1308
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,731
- This isn't happening.

1309
00:57:09,115 --> 00:57:10,323
- You know,

1310
00:57:10,323 --> 00:57:11,186
you've helped me.

1311
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:14,948
You've shown me that it's
 okay to go after what I want.

1312
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:19,263
- [Cid] Oh lips, man,

1313
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:20,678
move you're goddamned lips.

1314
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,439
Show her you're still alive.

1315
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:26,235
- Bye Cid.

1316
00:57:29,307 --> 00:57:32,103
[somber music]

1317
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:32,932
- Hey, um,

1318
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,038
if I let you chase
 me down the block,

1319
00:57:36,038 --> 00:57:37,799
would you stay?

1320
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:45,013
- You are gonna make some woman

1321
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:46,324
really happy.

1322
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,749
- Goodbye Fusco.

1323
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,929
She loved the
 thrill of the chase.

1324
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:07,484
She caught me, made me confess.

1325
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,761
And once she had me,

1326
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:10,176
the thrill was gone.

1327
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:13,731
Anyone at the precinct
 could have told me.

1328
00:58:13,731 --> 00:58:16,147
Fusco always gets her man.

1329
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,123
- Come on Cid,

1330
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:27,400
what's the point?

1331
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,850
- I'm jumping.

1332
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:29,678
I gotta jump.

1333
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:30,714
There's no other way.

1334
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:33,061
- Why's he gotta jump?

1335
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:34,269
- He hasn't said.

1336
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:35,097
- Hey Cid,

1337
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,583
why you gotta jump?

1338
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,032
- Geraldine.

1339
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:40,689
- I thought the
 stalking was over?

1340
00:58:40,689 --> 00:58:41,897
- Yeah, that ended Tully,

1341
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:43,140
but so did the love.

1342
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,729
- I didn't hear about the love.

1343
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:47,385
- We gotta get some
 experts on the scene.

1344
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:49,008
- Good idea,

1345
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:50,423
you keep talking to him,

1346
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:51,251
I'll get some help.

1347
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:57,326
- Hey Cid,

1348
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,432
you've always been
 there to help me.

1349
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:01,020
Why don't you get the fuck down

1350
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,262
so you can help me some more.

1351
00:59:02,262 --> 00:59:03,747
- Yeah Chuckles, how
 have I helped you?

1352
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:05,300
- Remember 14th Street?

1353
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,165
You were there for me when I
 needed to make the crossing.

1354
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:09,097
- Oh come on.

1355
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:10,408
It was your big moment,

1356
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:11,686
you wanted to keep it low key.

1357
00:59:11,686 --> 00:59:13,308
I turned it into a circus.

1358
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:16,483
- Maybe you should
 take the leap.

1359
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,938
- And then there was that
 time in seventh grade when

1360
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:25,078
I set your hair on fire.

1361
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:27,287
- Definitely jump, you fuck.

1362
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:35,123
- What the hell's going on here?

1363
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:37,297
- She left me to
 become a Texas Ranger.

1364
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:38,264
She was my pillar.

1365
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:40,335
She was my calm in the storm.

1366
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:42,130
- So you're gonna jump?

1367
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:42,958
- Yeah, that's right.

1368
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,028
I'm gonna jump.

1369
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:45,340
I'm gonna jump.

1370
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,548
I m gonna taste life
hanging in the balance.

1371
00:59:46,548 --> 00:59:48,964
- Charlton Heston
 would not be up there.

1372
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:50,587
- Oh you leave him out of this.

1373
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,657
- Fuck it.

1374
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:52,796
Go ahead and jump.

1375
00:59:52,796 --> 00:59:54,107
- Ignore this man.

1376
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:54,936
- Go higher.

1377
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:55,902
A few more floors up,

1378
00:59:55,902 --> 00:59:56,731
then jump.

1379
00:59:56,731 --> 00:59:58,008
- Silence.

1380
00:59:58,008 --> 00:59:58,940
- Yeah, how will you
 know the difference

1381
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,182
if you never make a move?

1382
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:01,390
- Eddie, this is nowhere to go.

1383
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,013
- It's the only way.

1384
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:04,911
Make the jump, Cid.

1385
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:07,604
Make it dramatic and push
 off like you want it.

1386
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,158
And pull a jackknife
 with a double twist.

1387
01:00:10,158 --> 01:00:10,986
Own it.

1388
01:00:20,478 --> 01:00:22,446
- Eddie, I gotta tell you

1389
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:24,172
about what happened
 Thursday night.

1390
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:26,450
- Alright, now's the time.

1391
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,278
Tell me now.

1392
01:00:28,141 --> 01:00:29,142
- Okay.

1393
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:30,247
Okay.

1394
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:31,179
A man in the
 tollbooth right on me,

1395
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:32,421
and I'm pushing him through.

1396
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,630
I'm making change
 when all of a sudden

1397
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,528
this beautiful blonde pulls up.

1398
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:36,736
Bang, I cut her loose.

1399
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:39,083
Next up, dynamite redhead.

1400
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:39,912
She's winking.

1401
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:41,085
She's smiling.

1402
01:00:41,085 --> 01:00:42,880
She's doing everything
 but marry me.

1403
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,642
[birds chirping]

1404
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,167
- Oh Fusco.

1405
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,550
You were supposed to save me.

1406
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:12,323
Whoa.

1407
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:16,569
[soft music]

1408
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:43,285
- How you supposed
 to strike a balance

1409
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:44,735
in this goddamned world?

1410
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,462
You got a job, a family.

1411
01:01:47,462 --> 01:01:49,602
You work your ass off.

1412
01:01:49,602 --> 01:01:50,983
Then you have it reattached

1413
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:53,123
and you work it off again.

1414
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:56,126
You feel trapped,
 you poor bastard.

1415
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:57,714
You once had the
 backbone and the legs

1416
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,543
to get the fuck out.

1417
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:02,477
But escaping is too easy.

1418
01:02:02,477 --> 01:02:04,859
I say keep the normal life.

1419
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:05,963
Trim your hedges.

1420
01:02:05,963 --> 01:02:07,585
Recycle your aluminum.

1421
01:02:07,585 --> 01:02:08,621
Win the bread.

1422
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:10,312
You gotta eat, right?

1423
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:14,109
But if you feel
 like blowing town,

1424
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:15,317
don't.

1425
01:02:15,317 --> 01:02:17,354
Blow in town.

1426
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:18,838
Blow all around town.

1427
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:21,323
Get inside your ship of steel

1428
01:02:21,323 --> 01:02:22,911
and open the fucker up.

1429
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:27,364
Make your jailbreak every
 day until the sun goes down

1430
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:28,641
and go man, go.

1431
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:31,678
Cause a life of the

1432
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:34,095
Asphalt Nomads
 says you can roam,

1433
01:02:34,095 --> 01:02:36,925
you can be free,

1434
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,894
and still be home in time
 for breakfast with the kids.

1435
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,939
- Hey, hey.

1436
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:52,320
Ray, what's going on?

1437
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,390
- Hey, my Cid.

1438
01:02:54,632 --> 01:02:57,118
Say man, you mind if I
 ride with you tonight?

1439
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:59,051
My car's out of commission.

1440
01:02:59,051 --> 01:03:00,293
- Yeah, hop in.

1441
01:03:08,681 --> 01:03:10,096
- So how's the driving been?

1442
01:03:10,096 --> 01:03:11,028
- Nice and quite.

1443
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,617
- Yeah, well that's
the way it aught to be.

1444
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:15,964
- What happened to your car man?

1445
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:18,035
- Yeah, well man it's like this.

1446
01:03:18,035 --> 01:03:20,141
You know, I'm gliding up
 8th Avenue the other night,

1447
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:22,557
you know, riding oh
 so high on the hog.

1448
01:03:22,557 --> 01:03:24,559
And then I swerved
 off course a little,

1449
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,043
you know, jumped the curb

1450
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:29,495
and bam, buried the fucker
 deep inside a newsstand.

1451
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:30,427
Boom.

1452
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:31,980
Took the whole shack down.

1453
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,086
Now I was setting up for
an easy double Hudson,

1454
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:35,846
and the next thing I know,

1455
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:38,815
oh Red's plowing his
way into the headlines.

1456
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,816
- Jesus Christ.

1457
01:03:41,369 --> 01:03:45,235
- You know, it's a true pleasure
to watch you at the wheel.

1458
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:48,894
- I'm just steering, two hands.

1459
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:50,654
- No, no, that's bullshit.

1460
01:03:50,654 --> 01:03:52,000
Hey, you'll find your pocket

1461
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,381
and float your boat.

1462
01:03:53,381 --> 01:03:55,210
It's automatic.

1463
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,729
- I do that?

1464
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:58,248
- [Ray] Yes you do.

1465
01:03:58,248 --> 01:03:59,490
- Yeah, well you should see
 some of the other nomads.

1466
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,837
- No, fuck that and
take the compliment man.

1467
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,184
What you got is gold.

1468
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:05,151
Gold.

1469
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:08,361
[laughter]

1470
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,745
Oh man, this boat
 rides so damn smooth.

1471
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:15,127
[soft music]

1472
01:04:31,764 --> 01:04:33,870
Damn, what a move.

1473
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,354
Hey, you put it on slow release

1474
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:38,736
and then bam, we're in the
 thick of a triple axle.

1475
01:04:38,736 --> 01:04:40,566
- Yeah, that's one
 of my favorites.

1476
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:41,912
[laughter]

1477
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:44,225
- Expect nothing
 less from El Cid.

1478
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:49,092
You know only a few have
 even tried a flying Melinda.

1479
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:51,853
Anybody ever watch you do it?

1480
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:53,165
- Yeah, I don't
 think anybody cares.

1481
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:54,683
- No, no, save the
 modesty bullshit.

1482
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:56,133
Now I need to know.

1483
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,480
I mean now that I'm riding
 in your inner sanctum.

1484
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,379
Give me the scoop on
 that Rivera magic.

1485
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:01,863
- Come on.

1486
01:05:01,863 --> 01:05:03,071
- No, no, come on now
 you can't hold out on me.

1487
01:05:03,071 --> 01:05:05,453
This is Ray, okay.

1488
01:05:05,453 --> 01:05:06,385
Ray.

1489
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:07,179
- What, you really want to know?

1490
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:09,319
- [Ray] I want to know.

1491
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,699
- You're not ready.

1492
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:11,838
- Yes I am, I'm ready.

1493
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:14,945
- Ballet slippers.

1494
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,120
- What you say?

1495
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,536
- Ballet slippers on my
feet to work the pedals.

1496
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:20,744
- That's bullshit.

1497
01:05:20,744 --> 01:05:22,470
- No, no, look in the
 glove compartment.

1498
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:25,507
- No fucking way.

1499
01:05:25,507 --> 01:05:27,785
[laughter]

1500
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:30,374
Well shit.

1501
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:33,101
I'm riding with
 Ball shore Rivera.

1502
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,551
- Light on the touch,

1503
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:36,725
light on the pedals.

1504
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:38,831
Now I'm floating into
 a smooth stretch,

1505
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:40,488
I slip them on,

1506
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:42,007
tickle the pedals.

1507
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:43,284
I can turn this boat around

1508
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:44,526
like a trained dolphin.

1509
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:48,461
- Man you are one
different motherfucker.

1510
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:50,187
[laughter]

1511
01:05:50,187 --> 01:05:51,740
Hey y'all,

1512
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,881
this is El Cid Rivera
 behind the wheel.

1513
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:56,953
Yeah, El Cid

1514
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,195
[speaking foreign language]

1515
01:05:58,195 --> 01:06:01,095
Take notice motherfuckers.

1516
01:06:01,095 --> 01:06:03,304
[laughter]

1517
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:05,754
[soft music]

1518
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:19,044
You know Cid, you got
 all of this going on

1519
01:06:19,044 --> 01:06:20,700
and you still running
 around this town

1520
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,357
trying to find your thing.

1521
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:24,463
- I'm just sweeping
 the grid here.

1522
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:26,120
- Yeah, but you take a
 corner like you hoping

1523
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,880
to arrive somewhere.

1524
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,502
- No, there's no harm
 in looking for a sign.

1525
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:31,194
- The sign is here dammit.

1526
01:06:31,194 --> 01:06:33,610
When you feel the pull
 of a five lane sweep.

1527
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,302
When you hurdle through space,

1528
01:06:36,302 --> 01:06:37,994
cradling the natural forces,

1529
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,719
you're in the thick of it baby.

1530
01:06:42,205 --> 01:06:45,104
Well take your throne
 behind the wheel, El Cid.

1531
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:47,451
Inherit what's yours man.

1532
01:06:47,451 --> 01:06:48,280
Own it.

1533
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:55,045
Look, drop me off
 at the next corner.

1534
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:57,116
Big Red's gotta
 get his beauty rest

1535
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:58,428
before work starts.

1536
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:05,124
- [Cid] It was good
 seeing you Ray.

1537
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,751
- You go ahead and
 take it lightly, Cid.

1538
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:13,512
But you get back
out on that road

1539
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,928
and you feel it for
 even an instant,

1540
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:18,034
then you tell me I'm lying.

1541
01:07:39,227 --> 01:07:42,161
[slow jazzy music]

1542
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,235
- [Cid] My name
 is El Cid Rivera.

1543
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:50,583
Today I am 33 years old.

1544
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,585
Since I landed on this earth,

1545
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:56,313
the world has made
 12,045 rotations

1546
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:59,627
and completed 33
 total revolutions,

1547
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:02,078
and I'm still standing still.

1548
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:11,190
- [Tully] I think
 I wrestled him.

1549
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,881
[laughter]

1550
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,297
- No.

1551
01:08:14,297 --> 01:08:15,539
I don't think you wrestled
 flesh eating disease

1552
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:16,782
or you wouldn't
 be here right now.

1553
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:17,679
- That's a real name
 of some wrestler guy?

1554
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:18,887
- Flesh Eating Disease.

1555
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:19,819
- Is he big?

1556
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:21,097
- Yeah, he's big, he's huge.

1557
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,374
- He's not as big
 as he was, though.

1558
01:08:22,374 --> 01:08:23,996
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1559
01:08:23,996 --> 01:08:25,101
- Hey Eddie.

1560
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,688
- Hey, happy birthday,
 El Cid Rivera.

1561
01:08:26,688 --> 01:08:29,243
Did you think we'd forget?

1562
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:31,866
- Oh no, all the
 hoopla gave it away.

1563
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:33,730
- [Tully] Well let's get the
 festivities underway, Edward.

1564
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,145
Take your seat.

1565
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:36,319
- I would, but then I
 wouldn't be able to bring in

1566
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,424
a very special surprise guest.

1567
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:39,770
- How about some good news?

1568
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,220
- [Eddie] You could say that.

1569
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,877
- Some good news from
 the fire academy,

1570
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:44,120
maybe hand delivered?

1571
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,604
- It's gotta be
 the fat envelope.

1572
01:08:45,604 --> 01:08:47,709
Fat envelope says you're
 gonna be a fireman, baby.

1573
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:48,538
- Better than that.

1574
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:49,815
Come on, pal.

1575
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:51,230
Who'd you like to meet most?

1576
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:54,751
- Holy shit.

1577
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:55,890
You've really come through.

1578
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:56,925
- Oh don't tell me you got--

1579
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,513
- You brought Heston to the bar?

1580
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:00,308
- Oh god, dear god.

1581
01:09:00,308 --> 01:09:01,447
- Well,

1582
01:09:01,447 --> 01:09:03,311
no.

1583
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:04,588
But almost as good.

1584
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:07,695
El Cid Rivera,

1585
01:09:07,695 --> 01:09:09,283
celebrating 33 years

1586
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:11,733
since your official
 launch from the womb,

1587
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:13,218
meet the one,

1588
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:14,598
the only,

1589
01:09:14,598 --> 01:09:16,359
Ralphie Dodd.

1590
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:25,954
- This is it?

1591
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:27,266
- This is it.

1592
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:28,647
- So who's the birthday boy?

1593
01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:29,820
Happy birthday.

1594
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,443
Hey, somebody
 bring me a bourbon.

1595
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:38,795
- Funny, you don't look
like Charlton Heston.

1596
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,798
- It's Ralphie Dodd.

1597
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:43,109
- What's a Ralphie Dobs?

1598
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,283
- I tried to get Heston,

1599
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:46,699
but his personal
 secretary suggested

1600
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:48,149
that Cid get a life of his own.

1601
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:50,393
- Is somebody
 getting me a bourbon?

1602
01:09:50,393 --> 01:09:54,190
- I never dreamed I'd
be meeting Ralphie Dodd.

1603
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,605
- Who the hell is Ralphie Dodd?

1604
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:56,433
- Come on, Cid.

1605
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:59,195
Ever heard of a little
 film called Ben Hur?

1606
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,437
- Faint recollection.

1607
01:10:00,437 --> 01:10:01,783
- [Eddie] Remember the
 great chariot race?

1608
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:02,922
- Only one of the
 greatest moments

1609
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:04,338
in silver screen history.

1610
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:05,615
- Ralphie Dodd,

1611
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:06,788
you directed Ben Hur?

1612
01:10:06,788 --> 01:10:07,996
- No.

1613
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:10,827
Ralphie here is the
 guy who actually

1614
01:10:10,827 --> 01:10:13,795
painted the wheels
 on Ben Hur's chariot.

1615
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:14,796
- In the flesh.

1616
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:19,076
[laughter]

1617
01:10:19,076 --> 01:10:21,355
- Well, well, pull
 up a chair, Ralphie.

1618
01:10:21,355 --> 01:10:23,219
- No, no, no, Tully, do not

1619
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:27,015
mock this man,

1620
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:29,259
for he is the genuine article.

1621
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:30,950
He has walked
 amongst the sacred.

1622
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,952
He has tasted from the cup.

1623
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:35,334
- Where the fuck is my bourbon?

1624
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,577
- [Barkeep] Here's your bourbon.

1625
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:38,199
- [Eddie] Alright,

1626
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:39,752
let's kick off this
 joyous celebration.

1627
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:41,133
- I don't know where to begin.

1628
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:42,203
- Hey, hey, look champ.

1629
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:43,411
I mean no offense, but

1630
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:46,725
you strike me as
 kind of a fruitcake.

1631
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:48,278
Hey Eddie,

1632
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:49,969
I don't know how safe it is
 sitting next to this guy.

1633
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:51,488
- No, Ralphie, stay.

1634
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:53,318
Make it special.

1635
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:57,080
- Well now they say that you

1636
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,221
served alongside the
 man called Heston.

1637
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:02,016
Now you heard his words,

1638
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:02,982
you saw him in action.

1639
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:04,190
- Hey, hey, back off will you.

1640
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,916
You're beginning to make
me a little nervous.

1641
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:06,745
- Ralphie, he's harmless.

1642
01:11:06,745 --> 01:11:08,125
He's just so excited.

1643
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,644
- Yeah, that's what they
said about Jack Ruby.

1644
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:11,094
- Alright, well let me,

1645
01:11:11,094 --> 01:11:12,475
let me rephrase the question.

1646
01:11:12,475 --> 01:11:14,856
- Hey, ceasefire, will ya?

1647
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:17,307
Obviously you're the one that
 Eddie's been telling me about,

1648
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,757
the big Chuck Heston fan.

1649
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:20,034
- Yeah, you could say that.

1650
01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:21,449
I mean I don't know if
 Eddie told you about--

1651
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:22,692
- Okay, okay.

1652
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:23,624
I know where you're
 going with this thing

1653
01:11:23,624 --> 01:11:25,246
so don't strain yourself because

1654
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:27,144
this is your special
 day, you know.

1655
01:11:27,144 --> 01:11:29,940
Yes, I painted the
 wheels on his chariot,

1656
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,252
and yes, I knew Heston.

1657
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:33,185
I worked with him
 on many pictures.

1658
01:11:33,185 --> 01:11:34,669
- Wait, you actually knew him?

1659
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:37,327
- I think I made that pretty
clear in my previous statement.

1660
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,674
- Very clear Ralphie.

1661
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:41,642
- Well what was he like?

1662
01:11:41,642 --> 01:11:42,643
I mean--

1663
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:43,851
- What was he like?

1664
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:45,542
He was a regular
 guy like you and me.

1665
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:47,303
Well like me.

1666
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,443
I mean he caught colds,

1667
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:50,858
occasionally got a paper cut.

1668
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:52,169
Hey look, if you met the guy--

1669
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:53,516
- It would be the
proudest day of my life.

1670
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:56,450
- You would meet a
 regular, nice guy.

1671
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:57,968
He paid his dues.

1672
01:11:57,968 --> 01:11:59,970
He reaped his rewards.

1673
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,489
- Yes he did.

1674
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:03,698
- But he did it with a lot
 of help from guys like me.

1675
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,736
- You?

1676
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:07,737
- Yeah.

1677
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:08,979
- No, no, no, no.

1678
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:10,429
Different league, pal.

1679
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:11,810
He is the anointed one.

1680
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,605
He is the man of Soylent Green.

1681
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:14,882
The Omega man.

1682
01:12:14,882 --> 01:12:16,297
- Hey, cool off Cid.

1683
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:17,333
- If Sophia Loren were here,

1684
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,403
she'd slap you.

1685
01:12:18,403 --> 01:12:19,231
- Hey.

1686
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:20,266
Back to the party.

1687
01:12:20,266 --> 01:12:21,440
Back to the party.

1688
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,372
- Alright, no,

1689
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:23,960
alright, no everything's cool.

1690
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,479
Everything's--

1691
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:26,514
- I just.

1692
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:27,515
- No go on.

1693
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:28,413
Go on, I want to
hear more about,

1694
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:29,724
about how you

1695
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:31,968
helped Heston, you rat bastard.

1696
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:33,521
- [Group] Hey, Cid.

1697
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:36,835
- Hey, we all helped Heston.

1698
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:39,665
Me and a cast of thousands
 behind the scenes.

1699
01:12:39,665 --> 01:12:41,633
We put the epic in epic.

1700
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:43,151
Let me tell you something.

1701
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,843
The skies I painted
 for his pictures,

1702
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:46,431
you've never seen skies so blue

1703
01:12:46,431 --> 01:12:47,742
until I painted them.

1704
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:48,985
- Ah, the modesty.

1705
01:12:48,985 --> 01:12:50,814
- There's nothing
 modest about it.

1706
01:12:50,814 --> 01:12:52,782
They called me Mr. Magic.

1707
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:54,300
I made dreams come true.

1708
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,544
- Scenic backdrops do not make

1709
01:12:56,544 --> 01:12:57,787
an epic hero.

1710
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:00,099
It takes courage and
vision to lead a people.

1711
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:02,343
- And a very good script

1712
01:13:02,343 --> 01:13:04,241
written by fat little
 four eyed writers,

1713
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:06,658
writing lines about
 liberty and justice.

1714
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:08,660
Writers who then drive home,

1715
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,316
kick the dog, hit the kids,

1716
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:12,111
and down a fifth of scotch.

1717
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:14,355
[laughter]

1718
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:18,290
- Uh huh.

1719
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,878
- Hey, don't get me
 wrong birthday boy.

1720
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:21,742
Heston was a great actor,

1721
01:13:21,742 --> 01:13:23,675
but the armies he led

1722
01:13:23,675 --> 01:13:25,401
followed his every command

1723
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,024
because page 98 of the script

1724
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:29,508
told them to.

1725
01:13:29,508 --> 01:13:32,442
[slow jazzy music]

1726
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:36,550
- Is this guy inspirational

1727
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,689
or what?

1728
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,417
- Hey you know Eddie,

1729
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,522
this wasn't so bad after all.

1730
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,593
- Hey, it's a party
 for Christ's sakes.

1731
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:46,422
- I'll tell ya,

1732
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,216
I worked with the best.

1733
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:49,425
The Duke.

1734
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,426
Brando.

1735
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,599
Elizabeth Taylor

1736
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:53,429
and her two magnificent tits.

1737
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,637
Now they were epic.

1738
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,639
Ho ho, what jugs.

1739
01:13:56,639 --> 01:13:57,847
[laughter]

1740
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,193
- Hey, Ralphie, thanks
 a lot for coming.

1741
01:13:59,193 --> 01:14:00,021
- Yeah sure, Eddie, sure.

1742
01:14:00,021 --> 01:14:01,091
I'll see you guys.

1743
01:14:01,091 --> 01:14:02,472
- Take it easy Ralphie.

1744
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:06,338
[slow jazzy music]

1745
01:14:06,338 --> 01:14:07,270
Now this

1746
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:08,996
was a birthday to remember.

1747
01:14:14,795 --> 01:14:16,382
- Liz Taylor,

1748
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:18,523
I think she's got the
 flesh eating disease.

1749
01:14:18,523 --> 01:14:19,800

[soft music]

1751
01:15:15,614 --> 01:15:16,615
- [Mama] Cid, El Cid.

1752
01:15:16,615 --> 01:15:17,996
- [Cid] Yes mama.

1753
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:20,412
- [Mama] El Cid,
 are you succeeding?

1754
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:22,897
- [Cid] I don't know.

1755
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:25,141
What's it mean to
 be succeeding, mama?

1756
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:28,144
- [Mama] We covered that
 when you were five, my Cid.

1757
01:15:28,144 --> 01:15:29,421
- Tell me again.

1758
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:31,561
- [Mama] Don't mess
with the basics, my son.

1759
01:15:31,561 --> 01:15:34,081
- I can't be sure, mama.

1760
01:15:34,081 --> 01:15:36,324
- [Mama] El Cid,
 are you succeeding?

1761
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,534
- I don't know, mama.

1765
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:53,410
Now let the motorists
avoid the dips and rises

1766
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,826
in the pavement.

1767
01:15:54,826 --> 01:15:57,518
It's the nomad that
dares to ride them out,

1768
01:15:57,518 --> 01:15:59,209
see what they got to offer

1769
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:01,418
when it pops you up
 and sets you airborne.

1770
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:03,282
See, the nomad

1771
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:06,838
respects and wrestles
 with the forces

1772
01:16:06,838 --> 01:16:08,633
to create something greater.

1773
01:16:08,633 --> 01:16:10,427
All the forces,

1774
01:16:10,427 --> 01:16:12,913
the ones you slept through
 in 11th grade physics,

1775
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:14,535
well they back baby.

1776
01:16:14,535 --> 01:16:15,812
So cuddle up.

1777
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:19,264
The G forces, the centripetals,

1778
01:16:19,264 --> 01:16:20,679
the centrifugals.

1779
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:23,993
Now how many can you
 get working for you

1780
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:26,064
when the night holds
 you in it's grip?

1781
01:16:26,892 --> 01:16:28,100
Now pay homage, nomad,

1782
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:30,862
you fight the natural forces,

1783
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:32,449
and they'll break you.

1784
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:34,244
Make friends,

1785
01:16:34,244 --> 01:16:36,350
and they'll set you free.

1787
01:17:00,374 --> 01:17:02,376
- Boys, I'd like
 to make a proposal.

1788
01:17:03,895 --> 01:17:06,760
- I hope it's not that thing
 about switching seats again.

1789
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,727
- Edward, all I want
 is a little change.

1790
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:11,040
- It's a dead issue, pal.

1791
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,076
- Now Cid would understand
 my desire for change.

1792
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:15,838
- You don't start playing
 with natural laws.

1793
01:17:15,838 --> 01:17:16,977
- Unspeakable.

1798
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,679
but it ain't happening.

1799
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,026
Besides, we don't have a quorum.

01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:33,545
You need a quorum.

- Hell, we have a quorum.

1802

01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:28,315
[soft music]

1807
01:19:42,536 --> 01:19:43,986
Mysterious as the Nile,

1808
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:47,472
and hollowed as the Ganges.

1809
01:19:47,472 --> 01:19:49,681
Keeper of the nomad faith.

1810
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:53,719
Lifeblood of the perfect ride.

1811
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:56,136
[soft music]

1812
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:06,266
[dramatic music]

1813
01:22:11,512 --> 01:22:12,513
- Hey.

1814
01:22:12,513 --> 01:22:14,101
Yeah.

1815
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:15,344
- Have you seen this stick ball

1816
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:16,414
that used to be like
 everywhere, you know.

1817
01:22:16,414 --> 01:22:17,346
Every day.

1818
01:22:17,346 --> 01:22:18,312
- I never see it anymore.

1819
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:20,556
- You kids don't play.

1820
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:23,317
[dramatic music]

1821
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:48,273
- Take a load off
 the floor, Tully.

1822
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:50,206
- Yeah, deal with the
 horrible truth, pal.

1823
01:22:50,206 --> 01:22:51,552
That's your seat.

1824
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:53,037
Tonight and every night.

1825
01:22:53,037 --> 01:22:54,107
- Goddamn it.

1826
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:01,217
[soft music]

1827
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:20,236
- [Tully] Anybody
 seen Cid today?

1828
01:23:20,236 --> 01:23:21,065
- He'll be here.

1829
01:23:21,065 --> 01:23:21,997
It's our usual night.

1830
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,205
- Every night's our usual night.

1831
01:23:23,205 --> 01:23:24,689
- That's why he'll be here.

1832
01:23:24,689 --> 01:23:26,035
Where else is he gonna go?

1833
01:23:29,935 --> 01:23:30,936
- [Mama] Cid, El Cid.

1834
01:23:30,936 --> 01:23:32,145
- [Cid] Yes mamma?

1835
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,698
- [Mama] What's going on here?

1836
01:23:33,698 --> 01:23:36,873
- [Mama] I'm taking
 a sabbatical, mama.

1837
01:23:36,873 --> 01:23:39,911
- [Mama] You can't be
 succeeding in sabbaticing

1838
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:41,119
at the same time.

1839
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:42,741
Now turn this bucket
 of rust around and

1840
01:23:42,741 --> 01:23:44,640
[speaking foreign language]

1841
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,951
- [Cid] Mama.

1842
01:23:45,951 --> 01:23:48,023
- [Mama] Yes, my golden child.

1843
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,472
- [Cid] I want you to listen.

1844
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:52,889
I love you very much,

1845
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:55,133
but I want you to shut up.

1846
01:23:55,133 --> 01:23:56,341
[speaking foreign language]

1847
01:23:56,341 --> 01:23:58,067
- [Mama] I have raised
 the Devil's child.

1848
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:00,138
- [Cid] Now mama,
 you've got to listen.

1849
01:24:00,138 --> 01:24:02,209
You've been with
 me for a long time.

1850
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:06,041
I think you must be very tired
 of raising me for so long.

1851
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,113
- [Mama] It is a great
 challenge, yes, but I'm--

1852
01:24:09,113 --> 01:24:11,149
- [Cid] I think after
 all these years,

1853
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:14,359
you really deserve
some time for yourself.

1854
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:15,636
You must be a little tired

1855
01:24:15,636 --> 01:24:17,052
from looking after your child.

1856
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,536
You've paid your dues.

1857
01:24:18,536 --> 01:24:20,055
- [Mama] Yes, my son.

1858
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,849
I have.

1859
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:24,680
- [Cid] You've done a
 really good job, mama.

1860
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,923
- [Mama] Thank
 you my lovely one.

1861
01:24:26,923 --> 01:24:28,477
- [Cid] So let me go,

1862
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:30,306
for a little while.

1863
01:24:30,306 --> 01:24:31,169
If you stay with me,

1864
01:24:31,169 --> 01:24:33,206
I may ware you out.

1865
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:34,759
- [Mama] And you're
 gonna be okay?

1866
01:24:34,759 --> 01:24:36,968
- [Cid] You prepared me well.

1867
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:38,521
[laughter]

1868
01:24:38,521 --> 01:24:41,800
- [Mama] Well, this is
 a whole new ballgame.

1869
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,046
Maybe I will take a little
 vacation with the girls.

1870
01:24:46,046 --> 01:24:47,737
That would be nice.

1871
01:24:47,737 --> 01:24:49,118
- [Cid] You deserve it mama.

1872
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:50,326
- [Mama] Then,

1873
01:24:50,326 --> 01:24:51,948
it is settled.

1874
01:24:51,948 --> 01:24:54,296
So I talk to you
in a few months,

1875
01:24:54,296 --> 01:24:56,574
my beautiful Cid.

1876
01:24:56,574 --> 01:24:57,920
- [Cid] Take your time, mama.

1877
01:24:59,335 --> 01:25:00,785
[soft music]

1878
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:01,786
- No sign of him.

1879
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:05,755
- Maybe he's out drinking
 with the Asphalt Nomad types.

1880
01:25:05,755 --> 01:25:08,068
- Hey, he's free to
 do as he pleases.

1881
01:25:08,068 --> 01:25:10,415
- Hey, you can't get
any freer in this town.

1882
01:25:10,415 --> 01:25:13,246
[uplifting music]

1883
01:26:01,432 --> 01:26:03,951
[jazzy music]
