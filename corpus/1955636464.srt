an English class of misfit,
goof-off students.

108
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,740
we'd make a night of it.

109
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,368
[Chris] Hang out, maybe?

110
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,037

in case you, uh...

115

There's no DVD player, huh?

I don't know how old,
maybe five, six...

142
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,568
You and I made her cookies,
for her birthday.

143
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,071
And then we forgot
to turn the oven on.

144
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,699
[Chris] And when
we presented them,
she still ate two.

145
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,953
[Chris] That was Mom.

146
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,294
Have you thought any more
about something you might like
to say?

147
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,760
I think I'll do
a little soft shoe.

148
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,642

whatever you're feeling. Okay?

Sixty five years.

153
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,165
I can't even remember...

154
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,585
my life without her.

155
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,716
Everyone tells me...

156
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,261
this is...

157
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,764
going to get better...

158
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,227
And easier.

159
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,857
I know they believe that.

160
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,944
But I can't see that happening.

161
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,576
I'm 87 years old,
and I've lost my Eva.

162
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,455
The truth is...

163
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,376
I've lost her a long time ago.

164

her life with me...

166
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,145
was a lie.

167
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,983
I don't blame her.

168
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,111
I blame myself.

169
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,491
She thought...

170
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,578
she married a
different kind of man.

171
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,291
A better man.

172
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,794
But, she was...

173
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,587
mistaken.

174
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,466
I'm a failure.

failed my family.

179
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,270
I failed myself.

[Max] Do you know
what distress is!

185
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,936
My wife, the love of my life,

186
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,271
is dead!

187
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,939
[Chris] You're scaring us as...

188
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,276
And you want me to sit here
and converse with you!

189
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,778
Okay.

190
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,615
I want you to know that
nobody thinks you're a failure.

191
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,285
[Annie] You had
a lovely marriage.

192
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,037
You have a family
that loves you.

193
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,496
You made a beautiful record.

194
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,665
Did something happen
between you and Mom,

195
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,750
that...

196
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,627
you haven't told me, or anyone?

197
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,504
No!

198
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,756
Nothing!

199
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,467
Absolutely nothing!

200
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,011
When Kat's father died,

201
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,055
her mom went to a
bereavement counselor,

202
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,015
"I'd like to make a
phone call, to see if..."

203
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,809
To make the phone call
and see if they'll accept you!

204
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,940
[Max] That's my answer
to your brilliant suggestion.

205
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,693
You're in pain.

206
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,528
That's all I see...

207
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,738
is someone in pain.

208
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,990
[Chris] I'm just suggesting
you talk to some...
someone else.

209
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,492
Someone outside the family.

210
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,327
You can't talk to me,
you won't talk to me.

211
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,120
Is he talking to you
about any of this?

212
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,456
About the stuff that he said
to a room full of strangers?

213
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,791
Enough!

214
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,554
[Annie] I got it, I got it.

215
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,722
[door slams]

216
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,979
[Max] Annie.

217
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,733
[Max] I'd like to
ask you something,

218
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,237
but you have to be sure to
tell me if I'm out of bounds.

219
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,281
Why wasn't Scott here tonight?

220
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,910
He's in Chicago.

221
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,290
[distant dog barking]

222
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,630
No. He, uh... He took a job
with the philharmonic there.

223
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,424
Why aren't you there?

224
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,594
It's complicated.

225
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,388
[Max] Come on, kid.

226
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,390
Just go.

227
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,060
[Max] Did you hear about...

228
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,395
the restaurant...

229
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,729
on the moon?

230
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,860
They serve great food,
but no atmosphere.

231
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,236
Hoo-hoo.

232
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,530
He, he, he.

233
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
Are you sure you
don't want me to stay?

234
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,325
We could make Chicken Annie.

235
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,494
No, I want you to go home...

236
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,329
and get some sleep.

237
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,000
[whispers] Okay.

238
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,713
It still doesn't feel real.

239
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,596
[inhales]

240
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,722
Chicken Annie,

241
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,516
tomorrow. I'm holding
you to it, Buster.

242
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,647
[kisses]

243
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,192
[door opens]

244
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,778
[Max] Goodbye, Annie.

245
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,322
[door closes]

246
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,782
[exhales]

247
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,830
[water flowing]

248
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,590
[Max] You know what
I thought about?

249
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,258
I was just lying there,

250
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,302
listening to you breathe.

251
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,555
And I never told
you, Eva, but...

252
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,477
You breathe nicer
than anyone I've
ever known in my life.

253
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,354
And...

254
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,314
I'm thinking to myself,

255
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,984
"We've had 65 years together,

256
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,903
but we never...

257
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,448
figured how old we were...
together.

258
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,159
-[Max] Do you know how old?
-[Eva] That's because my
arithmetic is so...

259
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,247
We're a hundred and
sixty nine years old.

260
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,414
Each?

261
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,541
No, not each!

262
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,585
-Both of us together.
-Oh, really?

263
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,295
A hundred and sixty-nine
years old.

264
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,130
It's a hell of a long time.

265
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,634
-[Max] Yeah.
-I wish we'd been together
a hundred and sixty-nine years.

266
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,845
[Eva] That would
have been great.

267
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,267
[clock ticks]

268
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,312
[floor creaking]

269
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:20,696
[clock ticking]

270
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,998
[inhales]

271
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,876
[floor creaks]

272
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,837
[closes door]

273
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,423
[clock ticks]

274
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,008
Ahh.

275
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,068
[suspenseful music]

276
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
[closes drawer]

277
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,865
[Max] I was cleaning
your dresser...

278
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,742
and the drawers...

279
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,995
and, I came up with this.

280
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,043
[Eva laughing]

281
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,383
[Max] You're the
secret in my heart.

282
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,135
"Ben."

283
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,932
There's a date on here.
November 5th, 1959.

284
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,726
I wracked my brain...

285
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,479
trying to think of that day.

286
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,155
[Eva] Remember your
recording session
in New York?

287
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,329
[Max] November 5th, 1959.

288
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,709
[Eva]  You've got
a flight to catch.

289
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,004
[Max]  And you said...

290
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,881
[Eva] Hurry home.

291
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,220
[Max] Until I join you.

292
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,681
[door opens]

293
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,808
[Annie] So...

294
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,393
this is...

295
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,980
Captopril.

296
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,899
[Annie] That is for
blood pressure,

297
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,069
and you take that once a day
in the morning, with food.

298
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,489
[Annie] And, this
is the new one.

299
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,324
What is that for?

300
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,826
[Annie] It's for...

301
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,954
when you get agitated.

302
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,123
-[Annie] Max?
-Yes.

303
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,583
[Annie] Why did you say
that stuff yesterday?

304
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,676
[Max] Can I have the pill?

305
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,762
Thank you.

306
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,225
Will you talk to me, please?

307
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,435
[Annie] What's going on?

308
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,071
[sighs]

309
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,910
[Annie] Oh, her compact.
I always loved this.

310
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,498
[taps table]

311
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,916
Open it up.

312
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,794
[clicks]

313
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,677
What is that?

314
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,768
She never let me play with it.

315
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,355
[Annie] I thought
you gave it to her.

316
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,202
Uh.

317
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,412
There are a thousand
explanations for this,

318
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,956
so, whatever you're thinking,
I'm sure you're wrong.

319
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,088
[Annie] I'm staying tonight.

320
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,632
Let's make some dinner, okay?

321
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,674
[Max] Yeah.

322
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,051
[Max] Good.

323
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,017
[Annie] Are you sitting
where I said?

324
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,518
Yes I am, honey.

325
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,811
[Annie] Close your eyes.

326
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,147
Uh, my eyes are on the floor.

327
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,899
[Annie] Keep them closed.

328
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,525
[Annie] Okay, you
can open them now!

329
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,486
[Annie] Are you ready?

330
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,530
[piano music playing]

331
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,117

00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,208
escalator.

335
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,462
-[Max] Oh, God!
-[laughing and clapping]

336
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,130
[Annie] Okay. And now...

337
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,174
I have a couple
of jokes for you.

338
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,803
Um, I asked
my 5th graders at school,

339
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,097
[Annie] uh, to tell me
their favorite jokes.

340
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,768
What does a fish say
when it runs into a wall?

341
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,645
"Dam!"

342
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,190
[Annie] Uh, um...

343
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,441
Um...

344
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,901
Let's try, uh...

345
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,196
What do you get when
you cross a vampire
and a snowman?

346
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,323
Frostbite.

347
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,909
[Annie laughing]

348
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,287
[Annie] Can we have a little...

349
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,664
Thank you! Thank you.

350
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,999
[laughs]

351
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,793
-[Max] Let me give
you a little sugar.
-[Annie] Mwah.

352
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,629
I'm so proud of you.
You were so good.

353
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,672
[Annie laughing]

354
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,049
You look like a skinny,
Roseanne Barr.

[Annie laughing]

356
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,762
[Annie] I don't know
if that's a compliment.

Well, uh, I wanted to ask
you here because, uh,

544
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,366

important for you to

with your peers.

that we have here.

00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,480

One of your big shot friends?

702
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,982
[Max] No, maybe you
bought it for yourself,

703
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,859
so you could go
and get another wife,

704
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,529

that you don't take care of.

00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,726
[Max] I got something
I gotta do.

899
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,817
[kids] Grandpa, grandpa.

900
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,360
Grandpa!

901
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,070
Grandpa, Max.

902
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,322
[Lucy] Grandpa, Max.
Grandpa, Max!

903
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,490
[Max] Hi, sweetheart.

904
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,741
Hi, darling.

905
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,578
How are you two? You both
getting ready for bedtime?

906
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,537
[kids] Yeah.

907
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,872
[Max] Yeah, that'd be nice.
I wish I could go with you,

908
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,833
'cause I'm so sleepy now.

909
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,002
-[Chris] You want to
play with your grandpa?
-[kids] Yeah!

910
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,628
[Chris] Get in there.

911
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,844
Is that the way you like it?

912
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,971
-[Lucy] Yeah, and then
put that on.
-[girl] Put the hat on.

913
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,472
[Max] No, I will
not wear a hat.

914
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,683
-[kids] Why?
-[Max] Cause I'll muss my hair.

915
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,019
-[kids] No, you won't.
-[Max] And I combed
my hair this morning

916
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,979
-for over 35 minutes.
-[kids] We won't muss
your hair.

917
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,522
[kids] You won't
mess your hair up.

918
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,566
[girl] Wait, put
them on his head.

919
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,568
[Lucy] I'll wear
the nose and the hat.

920
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,695
-[Max] You cant have the nose.
-[girl] Why?

921
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,615
-[Max] 'Cause it's my nose.
-[girl] It's not your nose.

922
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,116
-[Max] You want to put it on?
-Yeah.

923
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,367
[Max] Let's see if I...

924
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,162
Put your hand out. Let me see
if I can fit it on your nose.

925
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,497
[kid] Can it fit?

926
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,335
Lucy, you don't
have enough nose.

927
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,503
[Chris] You have
a preference in tea?

928
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,382
[Max] Breakfast tea.

929
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,508
[Chris] Uh-huh.

930
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,719
[Chris] Breakfast tea.

931
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,311
They're great kids, Chris.

932
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,106
I know.

933
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,027
Are you doing okay?

934
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,575
I don't know.

935
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,584
My marriage is falling apart.

936
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,211
My mom just died.

937
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,922
My dad thinks I'm
a waste of space.

938
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,132
I'm great!

939
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,259
I don't think you're a waste.

940
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,096
No?

941
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,725
Then why is it that's
one of the nicest things
you've ever said to me?

942
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,195
You know how you think back...

943
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,865
to when you were younger
and you had wonderful dreams.

944
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,869
[Max] Everything was
so beautiful, and pretty,
and nice...

945
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,871
and loving.

946
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,834
Those things just
don't go away.

947
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:57,088
We're guilty of
pushing them away.

948
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,845
I'm still a little groggy.
Is that an apology?

949
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,013
Don't push it, Chris.

950
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,142
You had your music.
You had Mom.

951
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,477
You guys somehow
loved each other

952
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,937
day in, day out,

953
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,106
for 65 years.

954
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,318
I'm two marriages in,
I still can't figure it out.

955
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,989
Sometime you have to act...

956
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,907
the way you feel.

957
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,869
The way you really feel.

958
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,246
That'd be nice.

959
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,127
Got anything in mind?

960
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:42,633
[piano music playing]

961
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,059
[Chris] That's some house.

962
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,562
[Max] Yeah, it is.

963
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,981
[Chris] Hey, pop...

964
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,025
here's the button over here.

965
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,860
[Max] Oh, okay.

966
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,779
[beeps]

967
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,614
[woman]  Hello?

968
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,533
[Max] I'm here for Ben Tracey.

969
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,495
[gate opens]

970
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,664
[Chris] I'll wait
for you out here, Pop.

971
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,630
[opens latch]

972
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,216
Eva Rose sent me.

973
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,096
[opening door]

974
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,559
[door opens]

975
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,147
[closes door]

976
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,274
He's in there.

977
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,526
Good luck.

978
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:48,741
[clock ticking]

979
01:03:56,332 --> 01:04:02,588
[clock chiming]

980
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,928
[Ben] I was so close.

981
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,808
So close. I almost
made it underground...

982
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,893
without seeing your face.

983
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,646
[Ben] Uh.

984
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,773
Come here.

985
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,275
[labored breathing]

986
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,235
Come on over here.
Come here!

987
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,114
There you go,
you can do it.

988
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,074
[footsteps ]

989
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,784
Come on, have a seat.

990
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,788
Do you play the piano?

991
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,373
[Ben laughs]

992
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,083
No, just sit down.

993
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,919
Come on,
come, on, come on.

994
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,338
Sit down,
sit down, sit down.

995
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,716
[Ben] Oh, God.

996
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,385
I got cigarettes there,
can you get me one?

997
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,887
Ahh.

998
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,598
[Ben] Oh, yeah.
Okay, good. Yeah.

999
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,766
How about a light?

1000
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,894
I know it's asking a lot.

1001
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,437
[strikes lighter]

1002
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,607
[Ben groaning]

1003
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:06,652
[Ben exhales]

1004
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,904
Eva...

1005
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,156
Lillian Rose.

1006
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,993
[Ben] She's survived
by her son, Christopher,

1007
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,288
her grandchildren,
and of course...

1008
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,081
ahh...

1009
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,293
by her beloved
husband of 65 years,

1010
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,838
Max Rose.

1011
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,673
Hmm.

1012
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,678
You don't know how
disappointed I am.

1013
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,474
I was hoping
you would go first.

1014
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,145
[Ben groans]

1015
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,065
[Ben] Ahh!

1016
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,733
Uh.

1017
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,318
[clicks]

1018
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,868
[Ben] So...

1019
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,453
What do you know about me?

1020
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,957
You're my wife's lover!

1021
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,959
[Ben laughs]

1022
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,920
[coughing]

1023
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,922
[Ben] Uh, listen...

1024
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,423
[water flowing]

1025
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,593
I, uh, I bought your
wife's drawings,

1026
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,388
so it's strictly a professional
relationship, okay?

1027
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,309
I don't believe you.

1028
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,895
Huh, well, you shouldn't.
It's a lie.

1029
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,232
I want the truth!

1030
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,483
[Ben laughing]

1031
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,777
Max Rose wants the truth!

1032
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,404
Everybody get that?

1033
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,280
[coughs] Well...

1034
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,199
[Ben] Let me make you a drink.

1035
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,704
[Ben] Okay.

1036
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,164
[Ben] Ahh! Here you go.

1037
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,001
Now, that's the finest
chair in my house,

1038
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,127
the most comfortable,

1039
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,505
I hope you like it,
because it's throne-like,
and that befits you.

1040
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,091
[Ben] You know what
I'm saying? Um, um, oh...

1041
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,135
Here's...

1042
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,761
to dying.

1043
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,807
[Ben] We all start out
with a slap on the ass,
and then we end up...

1044
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,060
jealous old men,
wishing we had
what the other guy's got.

1045
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:04,854
[chuckles]

1046
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,981
[Ben] Yeah. Ahh!

1047
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,401
[Ben] But...

1048
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,278
[exhales]

1049
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,282
it's what we do in the middle.

1050
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,744
And I got mine.

1051
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,372
Hollywood, big time.

1052
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,459
[Ben] Even my old man
was impressed. That bastard!

1053
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,668
[Max] Ben.

1054
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:32,298
Did you have
a relationship with Eva?

1055
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,220
Yes, no.

1056
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,889
What do you think?

1057
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:45,269
November the 5th, 1959.

1058
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,773
You crazy son of a bitch!

1059
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:53,027
You come onto my doorstep
and ask me about one thing
that happened 50 years ago!

1060
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,406
[chuckling]

1061
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,159
[Max] And what
happened that day?

1062
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,369
[exhales]

1063
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,996
I don't remember.

1064
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,749
[Max] I think you do.

1065
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,175
[switch clicks]

1066
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,770
November 5th, 1959.

1067
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,275
Where did you get that?

1068
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,034
[clicks open]

1069
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,706
[Ben sobbing] She...

1070
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,667
Oh, she kept it...

1071
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,419
She kept it.

1072
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:57,424
[sobbing]

1073
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:06,475
[coughing]

1074
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,601
[Ben] Could you...

That, uh, you were playing
at some club or another.

she was in love.

1097
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,967
And then she made...
