00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,473
Her type's sneaky like that;
they'll do anything,

359
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,009
Say anything,

360
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,877
Pray on your
fucking humanity.

361
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,715
Do you mind not talking
about me like I'm not here?

362
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,289
Jesus christ I can't wait to get
out of this fucking place.

363
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,865
I don't care
what you say,

364
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,867
We're blood, Teig,
the three of us;

365
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,703
You can't just treat her like
some god damn prisoner of war.

366
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:15,107
Do not try and tell me
what I can, and can't do,
this is my gig!

367
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:18,210
I put this whole thing together
and I'm the one that goes back

368
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,712
For a third strike
if it goes south, not you,

369
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,714
And not that
fucking junkie in there.

370
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,350
What, you think
I'm being hard on her?

371
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,385
Can you imagine
what it would be like for her

372
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,886
In prison
if we get busted?

373
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,189
How long to think
she'd last, huh?

374
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,026
With her little sensitive soul,
and her pixie-ish good looks,

375
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,128
Those women would
fucking eat her alive.

376
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:39,531
That girls is way past
needing some tough love,

377
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,901
Trust me; I'm doing her
the biggest favor of her life.

378
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,171
Well, I just think that...
Hey sirah?

379
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,743
If I want your opinion,
I'll fucking ask you for it,
okay?

380
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,121
You did your part,

381
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,857
This is mine.

382
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,327
Let me do it.

383
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,839
[Ominous music]

384
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,326
[Music builds]

385
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,837
[Music stops]

386
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,075
You probably gotta piss
like crazy about now, huh?

387
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,313
You got your shit
wired back together?

388
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,583
We'll see.

389
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,094
Better?

390
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,962
Yeah.

391
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,497
Thanks for asking.

392
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,639
What?

393
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,407
You going to watch?

394
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,443
Where am I going to go,
down the drain?

395
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,411
Don't push me, little girl.

396
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,987
This remind you of anything
from the inside?

397
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,291
Love and foreign objects
in the group shower?

398
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,261
You wouldn't want to know.

399
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,801
Hey, Lil?

400
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,236
No.

401
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,071
For what it's worth...

402
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,339
You're right,

403
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,242
I was out of my mind.

404
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,911
I'm sorry, really.

405
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,614
I would have fucked it up
for all of us.

406
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,184
Yeah well...

407
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,620
Anyway,

408
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,690
I'll let you finish up.

409
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:35,301
**

410
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,586
* music ends

411
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,226
So let me get this straight;

412
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,561
You left her alone

413
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,095
And unsupervised
in the bathroom?

414
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,231
Don't start
with me sirah.

415
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:41,933
All this planning
and you didn't think
to bring a flashlight?

416
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,702
We weren't supposed
to be going outside!

417
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,207
That way.

418
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,600
Come on!
Fuck her!

419
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,067
She'll give up
and come back, right?

420
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,404
I mean, its like
twenty miles to town.

421
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,472
Yeah, or she could make it
back to the highway,

422
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:21,940
And get picked up
by some truckers,

423
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,409
They take her
to the emergency room;

424
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,143
Who the hell knows
what she's going to say...

425
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,413
Or she could not make it,
messed up as she is,

426
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,880
She'll come out
into these woods,

427
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,549
Go in and never
come back out again,

428
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,783
Did you ever think
of that?

429
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:33,485
No.

430
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,887
Okay, I can't hear her anymore,
we gotta split up.

431
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,823
I'll go this way,
you go down,

432
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,559
Remember the house is downhill
and to the south, okay.

433
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,860
Right.

434
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,956
(Whispers)
who are you?

435
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,847
Fucking conniving
little cunt!

436
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,116
I ought to carve you
a new asshole for the shit

437
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,284
You put us
through tonight.

438
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,553
Tommy and his boys
are out for blood and...

439
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,723
You know what, fuck it, why am
I even wasting my breath? Get
up, you little fucking bitch.

440
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,324
Junkie, get back
to the house!

441
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,562
Lilly?

442
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,464
Teig?

443
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:53,732
Hey?

444
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,937
God damn it!

445
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,547
Here, now!

446
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:12,884
Sirah?

447
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,220
Sirah are you here?

448
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,090
No, Teig!!
No!

449
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,759
Teig! No!

450
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,828
Look, there's something
bad here, okay, I saw...

451
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,530
Look, you might
want to think about

452
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:25,997
Keeping that little cumhole of
yours shut-

453
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,600
No! Teig!
In fact...

454
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,569
Thanks to you-be still-

455
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,438
Now I have to go out
into the woods

456
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,940
And find my other sister.
No!

457
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,743
And you better be in exactly
the same place when I get back!

458
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,885
Ah, good, the whole family.

459
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,323
Where do you think
you're going, pretty girl?

460
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,109
You know sirah?

461
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,145
You really are a hot
little piece of ass.

462
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,147
And don't take this
the wrong way or nothing

463
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:19,951
But the last few days,
I've had this nagging feeling

464
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,721
That that little bit
you call a brain.

465
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,222
Ain't nowhere near
capable of

466
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,658
Planning this little scheme
all by yourself.

467
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,595
Drop it honey.

468
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,901
And why is it I don't think

469
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,169
Sirah decided to betray me
all by herself?

470
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,806
Why do I think somebody
persuaded her
to steal my property?

471
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,279
Well, I'm glad to see
you girls didn't have

472
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:51,349
Too good a time
the last few days with my junk.

473
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,520
How'd you find us?

474
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,822
I can't take all the credit
for that one.

475
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,191
You've got your sister
and her talkative little fingers
to thank for that.

476
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,529
I don't know
how you kept this one

477
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,764
Away from all this
badness in a baggie.

478
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,699
Then again, maybe I do.

479
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,235
You try to get yourself
a little fix, little girl?

480
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,672
Is that why you're
over here in timeout?

481
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,273
Leave her alone fucker.

482
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,009
You, you little firecracker.

483
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,146
You need to learn
when to keep that cute
little mouth of yours close,

484
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,413
And when to open it.

485
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:25,216
You want something
down there, huh?

486
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,719
You want my gun?

487
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,390
Yeah, I bet you do.

488
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,359
And, we come to you,

489
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,696
You gorgeous
little troublemaker.

490
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,197
Fucking stop it!

491
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,633
Big sister needs
to sit this one out!

492
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,702
Unless if she wants me
to talk with this hand...

493
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:45,837
I will kill you,

494
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,006
I swear to god
if its the last thing

495
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,041
I do on this earth
I will fucking kill you.

496
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,710
Its your fucking fault

497
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,311
Your sisters
are in this position, Teig.

498
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,846
And it will be your fault

499
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,481
When they're both
going to die as well.

500
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,217
How about I just blow a hole
in your fucking skull,

501
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,587
Put you out of your
misery fast,

502
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,389
And then take my time
with your little sisters.

503
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,092
What do you think of that?

504
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,696
Don't take it
too personally, though,

505
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:13,264
You've got some
smoking little body.

506
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:15,767
Hell, I may even
get tired of them,

507
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,736
And take a turn with you.

508
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,038
I mean, you don't exactly
got to have a head

509
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,573
For what I got in mind.

510
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,441
Yeah?
Why wait?

511
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,577
Let's go...

512
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:28,647
Or are you afraid I'll call you
on what a lousy fuck you are?

513
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,450
You wanna learn
what happens to little girls

514
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,552
When they try and play
with the big boys?

515
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,487
[Grunting]

516
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,795
I wonder
what it would feel like,

517
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,331
Fucking blowing your brains
out right as I finish...

518
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:58,910
Lilly, cut me loose.

519
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,861
[Muffled cry]

520
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,932
That is why I said
no cell phones.

521
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,104
Jesus,
this fucker is heavy.

522
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,138
Shouldn't we bury him?

523
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,606
Fuck him!
Let the crows have him.

524
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,275
I mean for us,
so nobody finds him.

525
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,443
No one's coming near here.
He did.

526
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,746
Yeah, well that's because
if someone wouldn't
use their phone...

527
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,481
I didn't...
Oh save it!

528
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,828
So, I guess this pretty much
changes everything, right?

529
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,262
This changes nothing!

530
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,597
But with tommy dead...

531
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,499
We stick to the plan.

532
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,803
But...
we stick to the plan.
No changes.

533
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,807
Changes are dangerous.

534
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,910
And staying put in the
same zip code of the guy
we just killed isn't?

535
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:09,881
God, she keeps doing that!

536
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,289
Hey... So, uhm, are you...

537
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,825
I'm fine,
just don't touch me.

538
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,700
[Ominous music]

539
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,682
One of us should
really go up there.

540
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,419
Look, I know you don't
want to go upstairs...

541
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:51,489
No, its fine, okay?

542
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,024
I need to do it.

543
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,036
Teig?
Is everything okay in there?

544
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,144
Teig,
are you okay in there?

545
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:47,372
We'll just, you know,
give her another day.

546
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:49,374
If she doesn't come down
I'll come back up.

547
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,209
Jesus, you look like shit.

548
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:56,047
And you're ice cold, too.

549
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:59,851
Are you ever going to tell me
what the hell happened up there
when you were kids?

550
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,186
It doesn't concern you.

551
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,787
Like hell it doesn't!
Okay?

552
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,190
I know something happened
upstairs in that room,

553
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,657
I know it,
I can feel it.

554
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,359
Fuck, the whole house
is seething with it.

555
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,128
Just get off of me.

556
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,598
Sy, please tell me
what the hell is going on here!

557
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,352
Our mom was pregnant
with our little sister,

558
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,221
Really pregnant.

559
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:41,692
Dad had been at the bottle
all weekend, and,

560
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:46,364
And mom and him
had been arguing...

561
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:55,773
( arguing )

562
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,009
About my mom?

563
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,677
Yeah.

564
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,180
She knew about it all along,

565
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,782
I guess she just decided
to go along with it,

566
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,918
But,

567
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:10,488
All that changed
when she found out about you.

568
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,961
This fight, it was...

569
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,364
It was worse than
all the rest.

570
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:24,135
They were yelling, screaming,
throwing things.

571
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:27,438
It was horrible.

572
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,810
I heard mom tell dad that

573
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,046
She found somebody else...

574
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,082
And that the baby
wasn't his.

575
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,085
Something just happened to him.

576
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,255
He just stopped yelling,
just like that.

577
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,168
Then without saying a word...

578
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:03,041
He went back upstairs,
and shut the door.

579
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:06,111
He didn't come out
for two days, not to eat,

580
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:09,114
Not to drink, nothing.

581
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:14,519
Mom didn't talk to us
the whole time.

582
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:18,856
Teig and I just
sat and played

583
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,827
Quiet little games to ourselves.

584
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,966
And then,

585
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:36,641
I heard mom,
in the kitchen.

586
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,011
She started to scream...

587
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:44,182
These long, horrible
wailing sounds.

588
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,021
We didn't know
what to do.

589
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,359
Finally, Teig she went
upstairs to get dad.

590
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,129
By the time he came down,

591
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:00,265
The kitchen floor
was covered with blood.

592
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,202
Something was wrong
with the baby.

593
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:10,375
She begged him
to call the doctor.

594
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,845
But he wouldn't do anything.

595
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,781
He just stood there,
staring at her.

596
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,087
Finally he picked mom up,
and carried her up the stairs.

597
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,097
What did he do to her?

598
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:34,932
Nothing.

599
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,268
He didn't do anything.

600
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:40,205
He just stood there watching

601
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:41,472
As her and her baby died.

602
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,250
We have to get out
of this place, sy.

603
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,888
Oh, hey, hi.

604
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,857
How you doing?

605
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:37,362
You texted tommy?

606
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,133
I had a guilty moment.
I felt bad.

607
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,802
I mean, we did sorta
put him in a bad spot,

608
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,371
Him losing all his
merchandise, and stuff.

609
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,908
Tommy and I,
its always been...

610
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,810
Complex.

611
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,479
You told him
where we were.

612
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,181
No, no I swear
to god I didn't,

613
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,015
I don't know
how he found out,

614
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,918
Here, check my messages
if you don't believe me.

615
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,620
You betrayed all of us.

616
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,291
Just like she betrayed him.

617
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:09,360
Just like?

618
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:11,896
Just like listen
to yourself, Teig.

619
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,632
This house hasn't
just gotten to you,

620
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,467
It's gotten into you.

621
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:20,838
Look, Lilly
and I both want to go,

622
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,773
We just need the keys
to the truck.

623
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,709
You want to stay?
Fine.

624
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:27,678
But Teig,

625
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,480
You should
come with us, okay?

626
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:32,550
It is bad here.
Its really bad.

627
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,455
Teig?

628
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,889
Teig?

629
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,793
Teig, don't walk away
from me!

630
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,229
Fuck!

631
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,320
Fuck you looking at, girl?

632
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,064
Go away!

633
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,666
I said get the fuck
away from me!

634
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,969
What, you think I wouldn't?

635
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,572
I will, I fucking will,
and then where would you be?

636
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:25,510
I spent so many years hating you
for what you did to me,

637
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:29,847
What you took from me,
what you made me.

638
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:33,851
If you were here right now
I'd kill you with my bare hands.

639
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,153
Oh, what, you
think I couldn't?

640
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,022
Take on a big,
strong man like you?

641
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:40,491
Oh I could...

642
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:41,826
I have.

643
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:47,698
You forced me to turn myself
into something

644
00:57:47,732 --> 00:57:49,299
That nobody could ever hurt,

645
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,169
And that's just
the shit of it, isn't it?

646
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,704
Everything I am,

647
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:57,441
Everything I've ever done
I owe to you,

648
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,743
You son of bitch.

649
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:03,848
You made me,

650
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:06,717
And then you broke me
into a hundred little pieces

651
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:09,153
And then you put me
back together again

652
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:12,923
Just the way you wanted...

653
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,427
Just like you.

654
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,599
Shh.
Not a sound.

655
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:55,900
Teig, just stop it.

656
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,868
Don't look at her,

657
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:00,938
She can't help you,
its just me and you.

658
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:04,875
Don't, Teig, stop it.

659
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:07,912
Beg me.
Stop it.

660
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:11,015
I bet you spread your legs
for every boy

661
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,885
With a dime bag
and a smile, don't you?

662
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:18,055
Poor little lost girl,

663
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:20,090
Nothing more than a mistake,

664
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:22,793
Evidence of lies
and broken lives.

665
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:26,597
Teig, stop, this
isn't you, its him.

666
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:28,933
Everything was fine
until you and your slut mother
came along,

667
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,568
You pushed her away,

668
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,571
You ruined everything,
you ruined everything!

669
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,650
Great.
Now what?

670
00:59:57,862 --> 01:00:01,098
Are you sure this is the
best place to leave her?

671
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,635
Well, we sure as hell
can't have her running around
loose like that;

672
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,971
At least until we can
find a way to get her,

673
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:08,272
And us, out of here.

674
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:11,676
Come on, let's go,

675
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,511
I do not want to be here
when she wakes up.

676
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,715
No no

677
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:57,021
No no no no no no!

678
01:00:57,054 --> 01:01:00,791
No no no!

679
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,059
You find the keys yet?

680
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,460
Not yet.

681
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,929
Where the hell
did she hide them?

682
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:10,034
No! No! No!

683
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,938
( Crying )

684
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,580
Its for her own good.

685
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,216
Okay, let's just look
in the living room, okay?

686
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,509
I can't even count
the number of times

687
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,578
I cursed you
down here as a kid.

688
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:58,715
I swore I'd never get
stuck down here again.

689
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,790
They'll pay for this...

690
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,559
Both of them.

691
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:25,309
I don't like
where this is going, sy.

692
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,779
Well, we don't really
have any choice, do we?

693
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:30,580
I mean, we can't get
anywhere on foot,

694
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:33,183
And I can't take it here
another week, can you?

695
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:41,125
Hey, its going
to be okay, all right?

696
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:44,494
No one else
is going to get hurt,

697
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:45,996
Not if I can help it.

698
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:51,301
Okay.

699
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:20,530
You and I need to talk.

700
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,668
Lilly and I
are leaving today.

701
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,876
I need the keys
to the truck.

702
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,559
Fuck Teig, say something!

703
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,369
I'm way past being tired
of your fucking shit,

704
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,670
Now hand over the keys!

705
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,342
Hand over that god damn
keys to the truck!

706
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:58,328
I knew you'd come back.

707
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,899
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

708
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,843
I'm so sorry
for what happened to you.

This is the last time
you ever fuck with me, girl!

891
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:46,435
[Singing voice] I know you're
here, sirah.

892
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:50,439
You know, I always
used to wonder why

893
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:54,310
It was dad took it out
on me and not you?

894
01:21:54,343 --> 01:22:01,050
You never got the belt,
the back of the hand,
the cellar.

895

What kept you safe
all those times, huh?

that I couldn't?

we'll never know.

Teig (O.S.) I know
what you're up to,

915
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,944
You're going
to take the stash,

916
01:26:55,978 --> 01:26:58,747
And sell it yourself,
cut me out...

917
01:26:58,781 --> 01:27:01,884
Well that's not
gonna happen!

and now Lilly's dead,

And you're just going
to have to die too.

922
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:18,967
I'm sorry Sirah,
really I am,

923
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:21,870
But if you'd just stuck
to the fucking plan...

924
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:24,473
There is no fucking plan
anymore, Teig!

925
01:27:24,507 --> 01:27:26,742
The stash, it's gone!

926
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:29,278
I drowned it, I dumped it
in the lake by the house!

It's fucking over,

you let him make you a puppet.

I couldn't?
