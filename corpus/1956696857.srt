1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,907
(gentle bouncy music)

2
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:50,623
- Okay, we'll do the plant
watering pointer first,

3
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,570
are you almost ready
with the set up Nigel?

4
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,557
- Seconds away.

5
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,520
- And then we'll do the
bit about using mayonnaise

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,790
as hair conditioner, and
we'll finish with the pointer

7
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,440
on how to clean the cat.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,760
- About shampooing cats,
I tried it in the lab,

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,860
it's not a good idea.

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,803
- Ooh, clearly.

11
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,868
- Kitty tray, powder, no cat, no cat.

12
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,085
- Okay, how do I look?

13
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:15,430
- Wunderbar.

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,552
- Alright chaps, we'll try one.

15
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,010
(bell ringing)

16
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,433
- [Director] Okay here we go.

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,800
- And now it's time for our
first Pru Pointer of the week,

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,860
this question comes from
one of our big fans,

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,960
Henrietta from Houston.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,250
Hey sweetie, tell Earl
that the crew just love

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,550
the latest batch of chili.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,110
Henrietta writes, dear
Prudence, Earl and I are going

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,710
bass fishing, the cats
can fend for themselves,

24
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,290
but I don't know how my poor plants

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,173
are going to get watered, help.

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,463
Houston, we have a solution.

27
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,710
Fill a bucket with water.
(water splashing)

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,630
tie some cotton twine around a brick,

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,253
put the brick in the water.

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,970
Take the end of the twine
and put it in the soil

31
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,940
of the plants.

32
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,580
Now the cotton sucks up
the water like a straw

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,940
and provides a steady supply of water

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,890
to the (yawns) cut.

35
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:15,912
(bell ringing)
- Cut.

36
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:17,310
- Speaking of sucking is this segment,

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,390
like totally tanking.

38
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,110
- No, not at all I --

39
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,350
- I agree, I think the
pointers fascinating.

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,760
- Oh yeah, I get it, the
pointers fine, but I'm tanking.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
- That's not what I'm saying.

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,570
- Oh no there's no
tankage, not at all, zero.

43
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,200
- That's what you're thinking.

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,570
And you know you're right,
I've just been off my game

45
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,220
for a while.

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm just feeling a bit,
I don't know, a bit --

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,650
- Distracted.
- Disconnected.

48
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,513
- Exhausted.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
- It's that obvious.

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,300
- You work too hard, your
mother was the same way

51
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,470
when she wrote the Pru Pointers column.

52
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,661
She lived to work.

53
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,430
- (scoffs) My mother
worked to avoid living.

54
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,700
- If the shoe fits sweetie.

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,670
- I am not my mother Jeffrey.

56
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,423
- You're getting there, it's why I'm going

57
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:56,823
to have to fire you.

58
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,730
- Fire me.

59
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,210
- You're the cornerstone
of my empire Prudence,

60
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,070
my cash cow, I can't afford
to have you burn out.

61
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,223
Finish the segment and you're gone,

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,790
for a week.

63
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,280
- [Pru] Are you off your meds again?

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,190
- You leave tomorrow,
take the company plane.

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,023
- To where?

66
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:13,233
- To my lodge in Wyoming.

67
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,140
- I'm a New Yorker, what
am I gonna do in Wyoming,

68
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,630
stare at the bloody mountains?

69
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,790
- Why not, stare at the
mountains, sleep, read,

70
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,173
start painting again.

71
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:27,527
(plane engine rumbling)

72
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,561
(muffled airport announcements)

73
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,772
(people chattering)

74
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:46,640
- Hello, I'm Prudence
McCoy, and you must be Ruth.

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,900
- Yes I am, nice to meet you Miss. McCoy.

76
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,870
- Oh no, please call me Prudence.

77
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,522
- So, how was your flight?

78
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:56,550
- Torture, four hours in that
plane felt like four days

79
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,443
and I wanted to sleep
but I couldn't of course,

80
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,710
I had no appetite, well
I never do when I fly,

81
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,410
and I had seen the movie the night before.

82
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,500
Coming down to land the
plane was shaking so badly

83
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,130
I thought it was gonna
come apart at the seams.

84
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,282
It's why I loathe vacations,
they're nerve wracking.

85
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,780
(buzzer sounds)

86
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,703
Bags already, in New York I
have to wait a week for these.

87
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,910
- Were there other
passengers on the plane?

88
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,320
- No, no, I was alone.

89
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,940
- I know this is a
ridiculous amount of luggage,

90
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,120
but I'm a terrible traveler,

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
I always have to pack
everything so I can decide

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,990
what not to wear.

93
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,283
Hold on, those squeaky
wheels are driving me nuts.

94
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:34,616
(gentle tinkling music)

95
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,610
- What is that?

96
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,920
- Olive oil, extra virgin,
good for rusty metal

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,560
and sticky locks, low acidity,

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,950
delicious on salads and vegetables.

99
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,033
Now try it again.

100
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,293
Pru Pointer number 86,

101
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,134
I got it from an old Italian plumber.

102
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:59,727
(gentle, bright music)

103
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,900
The sky is just so amazing.

104
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,140
Living in New York it's
easy to forget there is one.

105
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,540
- Well you should take advantage
of it while you're here,

106
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,900
especially the sunrise and sunset.

107
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,240
I know a beautiful place to view that.

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,170
- Would you take me out there sometime?

109
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,240
- Well I'm meeting some
people out there later,

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,040
I could rearrange it, then
we could stop on the way.

111
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,801
- That seems like the
perfect antidote to jet lag.

112
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,551
(birds chirping)

113
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,370
- Tassajaro's been a
sacred ground to my people

114
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,730
since time immemorial.

115
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,910
- It's beautiful land.

116
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,163
- We come here for ceremonies, fasting.

117
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,790
- What's the fabric on the trees?

118
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,273
- Those are prayer ties.

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,450
We bundle our prayers in
an offering of tobacco

120
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,043
to be carried to the
creator by the spirits.

121
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:28,000
- Was Bart Andrews a member of your tribe?

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,900
- Oh no, no the Andrews
family has owned Tassajaro

123
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,230
for 140 years.

124
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,190
- Isn't this your peoples land?

125
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,937
- Well yeah that's the way we look at it,

126
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,230
but the government
decided that they owned it

127
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,910
and they sold most of it
off to farmers and ranchers.

128
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,400
But when the Andrews
family bought Tassajaro

129
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,980
they promised it would not be disturbed.

130
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,210
- Hmm, looks like they kept their promise.

131
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,443
- Yes they did, especially Bart.

132
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,890
He was like family to
us, he loved Tassajaro

133
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,570
as much as we do, in fact we're holding

134
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,770
a commemoration of his
death here next week.

135
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:07,483
(car horn beeping)

136
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,620
Thanks for coming early.

137
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,810
Jean Philippe Andrews, Doug Craig,

138
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,820
this is Prudence McCoy,
she'll be staying at the lodge

139
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,850
for a few days.

140
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,460
- Hi, nice to meet you.

141
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,080
- Jean Philippe is Bart's son,

142
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,610
and Doug's the lawyer
for Andrew's Land Trust

143
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,410
that takes care of Tassajaro,

144
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,610
we're planning Bart's memorial together.

145
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,710
- I've got some ideas about that Ruth,

146
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,520
come and talk with me for a moment.

147
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,570
- Do you mind?
- No.

148
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,660
- Excuse us mademoiselle.

149
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,493
- So if you're staying at the lodge,

150
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,379
you must be the Prudence McCoy.

151
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:50,890
- The only one I know.

152
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,070
- I met Jeff Simcox when
I handled a zoning matter

153
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,920
out here for him.

154
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,900
You'd just taken over your mothers column,

155
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,428
he said you'd be even better then her.

156
00:07:57,428 --> 00:08:00,680
- Oh, I'm not sure about
that, different I hope.

157
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,280
- Ah, well my father was
a suspenders, cigars,

158
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,570
single malt scotch kind of lawyer,

159
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,787
I always wanted to be different too.

160
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,560
- So you don't wear suspenders?

161
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,100
- Or smoke cigars.

162
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,390
I do however enjoy my scotch,
would you like to have

163
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,250
a drink while your out here.

164
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,190
- I'd love that.

165
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,100
- Good.

166
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,520
- If I can fit it in to my days

167
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,128
of doing absolutely nothing.

168
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,830
(phone ringing)

169
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,220
- Excuse me, I should take this.

170
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,613
Excuse me, hello.

171
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,143
- So, Doug Craig.

172
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,073
- He's a nice man, he grew up here.

173
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,100
My son JR worked for him for a summer,

174
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,440
he's a long time friend of Bart Andrews,

175
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,373
like a son to him really,
very well liked, respected,

176
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,160
divorced.

177
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,390
(both laugh)

178
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,543
- Was I that obvious?

179
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,400
- We shouldn't have stayed so long,

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
would you like to get something to drink?

181
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,883
- Oh, I'd love that, I'm so thirsty.

182
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,410
- Been coming to this place since the day

183
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,193
I turned 21, met my husband Russell here.

184
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,845
(diners murmuring and chattering)

185
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,453
Hey Gord, Kathy, Eddie.

186
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,010
- Hey Ruth.

187
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,567
- Prudence McCoy, she's
staying at the lodge.

188
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:16,743
This is Eddie, he's a detective

189
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:18,393
with the police department.

190
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,730
I'll get us some drinks.

191
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,810
- Welcome to Wyoming.

192
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,200
- You're a Red Sox fan?

193
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,684
- Born in South El Paso.

194
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:34,540
- I live in New York.

195
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,942
- I won't even ask.

196
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,350
- Hmm, you're a clever man.

197
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,650
- Yeah, for a Red Sox fan.

198
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,940
- What do you shave with
anyway, a chain saw?

199
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,773
- What are you talkin' about?

200
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:45,310
- You have a serious case of razor burn.

201
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,752
- And?

202
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,440
- Well I hate to see a man in pain.

203
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,640
- Relax, I'm not in pain.

204
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,040
- Oh right, and selling Babe Ruth

205
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,270
wasn't the worst mistake in the history

206
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,330
of professional sports.

207
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,270
- That's history, the curse
of the Bambino is over.

208
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,700
- You wish.

209
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,760
- I don't have to wish, I've got

210
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,750
the World Series 2004, got
the World Series in 2007.

211
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,030
- Have you got some oatmeal at home?

212
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,160
- I hate oatmeal.

213
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,844
- You're not gonna eat it,

214
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,070
you're gonna rub it on your face.

215
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,400
- Rub it on my face?

216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
- That's right, three times a day,

217
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,530
leave it on for about 15 minutes,

218
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,070
razor burn will be gone in the morning.

219
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,180
Oh, and one more thing --

220
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,000
- No, that's okay, you've done enough.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,683
- Pop for a new razor
every three to four years.

222
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,835
(gentle bouncy music)

223
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,860
- I started working at the
lodge when I was in high school,

224
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
it's the only real job I had,

225
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,860
and then when my husband passed away

226
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,223
I moved in full time.

227
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,980
- This room makes
Carnegie Hall look small.

228
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,900
- Yeah, we call it the great room,

229
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,080
Mr Simcox designed it himself.

230
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,370
- Oh, of course he did, Jeffrey loves big,

231
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,963
and bigger, and biggest.

232
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,513
- I'll show you your room,
it's right over here.

233
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,360
Mr Simcox wanted you to stay in this room,

234
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,798
he said it would be
perfect for your visit.

235
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,610
- Well he's determined to see me relaxed.

236
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,090
- This lodge is wonderful for that.

237
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,880
- That's my mother.

238
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,340
- Yes this was her favorite
room when she stayed here.

239
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,480
- She stayed here?

240
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,900
- Many times after your father
passed on, you didn't know?

241
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,510
- No, but that's no surprise,

242
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,790
my mother was always a bit of a mystery.

243
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,410
I mean she never talked
to me about herself,

244
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,320
or about anything really.

245
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,170
- Yeah, I always used
to try to talk to my son

246
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,683
but he hated hearing his
mother telling stories.

247
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,663
- I would have loved to have
heard my mothers stories.

248
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:38,578
(gong chiming)

249
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,580
- Excuse me Prudence.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,893
- Who is this woman Jeffrey?

251
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,530
Well I'm not sure that
she is my mother you twit.

252
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,760
My mother didn't go on vacations.

253
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,910
I mean she hardly ever smiled,

254
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,660
and she definitely never had any fun,

255
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,460
well at least not when I was around.

256
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,870
And how come you never told me

257
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,033
that she came out here.

258
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,190
Well of course it's important to me.

259
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,510
Because she never told me.

260
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,530
Look forget the alien who's
pretending to be my mother,

261
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,690
what do you know about
Douglas Craig Esquire?

262
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,390
I just ran into him today in town.

263
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,533
Well is there anything
I should know about him?

264
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,853
Girlfriend, boyfriend, ax murderer?

265
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,393
I don't know, I might
call him, if I get bored.

266
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,443
Who are you, Yenta the matchmaker.

267
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,743
Goodbye.

268
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:44,289
(light bouncy music)

269
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,610
Okay, I'm officially bored.

270
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,732
(phone dialing)

271
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,193
Doug, er yeah it's Prudence.

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,943
Yes I got the flowers they're gorgeous.

273
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,380
Well I thought that, I
mean if you want too,

274
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,928
I would love to have dinner with you.

275
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:14,030
- [JR On Phone] Mom, I need to talk to you

276
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:18,330
as soon as possible, you've
got to stop what's going on

277
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,070
before it's too late.

278
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,040
Just remember, I'm doing this for you mom,

279
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,400
for you, for all of us.

280
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,233
I love you.

281
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:32,533
(phone beeping)
(phone dialing)

282
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,403
- [Ruth] JR it's mom, I'm
worried about you sweetie.

283
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,243
I want to talk to you, even
if it's just for a minute,

284
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:47,741
and I want to hear your
voice, just call me back,

285
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:52,741
please.
(phone beeping)

286
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,398
- Prudence it's none of your business,

287
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:04,398
stare at the mountains,
read a book, get a life.

288
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:16,633
Ruth, you okay?

289
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,522
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

290
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:25,983
- Ruth you're not fine.

291
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,203
- It's my son.

292
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,670
- [JR On Phone] Mom, I'm working
on this magazine article,

293
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,613
and it's turned into an amazing story.

294
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,509
I need to talk to you as soon as possible,

295
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,520
you've got to stop what's
going on before it's too late.

296
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,260
Just remember, I'm doing this for you mom,

297
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,803
for you, for all of us, I love you.

298
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,970
- You know anything about
the article he was writing?

299
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,223
- No he never talked to me about his work.

300
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,563
Moved away to a cabin,
traveled a lot, wouldn't call.

301
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,670
- You could drive out to his cabin,

302
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,290
make sure he's alright.

303
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,200
- No, I can't leave the
lodge and my guests.

304
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,570
- Yes you can, I mean
this is about family.

305
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,120
Besides your guests would
like to see some Wyoming.

306
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,353
And don't worry about the
lodge, we'll just lock the door.

307
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,921
- When he was younger,

308
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,040
I thought I knew what was best for him

309
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,390
we argued about everything.

310
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,500
Could you come in for a moment,

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,223
just to help me break the ice?

312
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:36,665
- Of course.

313
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,215
(knocking on door)

314
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,856
- JR.

315
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,096
(knocking on door)

316
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,096
JR it's mom.

317
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:55,439
JR.

318
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Chains on the door, cars
here, he must be home.

319
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,420
- Maybe he's asleep.

320
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,690
- Let's try the mud room.

321
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,048
JR, it's mom.

322
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,613
He's not here.

323
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,018
- Would you like to wait?

324
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,990
- No but I think I'll
straighten up his room,

325
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,750
he's got a month of dirty
clothes up there, do you mind?

326
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,750
- No, of course not.

327
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
So there I was with this humongous blob

328
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,670
of bubblegum stuck in my
hair and I was convinced

329
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,790
I was going to have to get my head shaved.

330
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,010
But my mother asked Mr Forsythe,
the man who ran her lab

331
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,400
to see if he could find
a way to get the gum out,

332
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,450
and he discovered peanut
butter did the trick.

333
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,183
Smooth, not chunky mercifully.

334
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,810
- You know Jeff Simcox was right.

335
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,643
- About what?

336
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:00,680
- About everything.

337
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,930
He said you were charming,
you'd make me laugh.

338
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,000
- When did you talk to Jeffrey?

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,300
- As soon as I got back to the office.

340
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,190
I hadn't talked to him for years,

341
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,393
but he was kind enough to take my call.

342
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:11,180
- Well that must have
been after I called him,

343
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,540
and picked his brain about you.

344
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,460
- Ah, and you decided to
have drinks with my anyway.

345
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,717
- I like to live on the wild side.

346
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,760
- Wyoming's a great place to do that.

347
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,300
- This is incredible, I have
seen you twice in one day,

348
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,460
I've become a very lucky man,

349
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,300
but not as lucky as you mon ami.

350
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,430
- Not even close.

351
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,760
- My fiancee loves your
program mademoiselle.

352
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,790
She threatened to call of the wedding

353
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,520
if I didn't somehow get your autograph.

354
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,540
I know it's tres gauche, but could you?

355
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,643
- Of course.

356
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,690
- You've made me a hero,
at least for tonight.

357
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,523
Merci beaucoup.

358
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,334
- When exactly did men stop
kissing women's hands, and why?

359
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,620
I mean it's so perfectly civilized.

360
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,440
- Well Jean Philippe is from France,

361
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,860
he likes to be tres cosmopolitan,

362
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,490
especially with beautiful women.

363
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,200
- Bart's son was born in France?

364
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,030
- Oh yes, see Jean
Philippe's mother, Jean Vieve

365
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,950
was Bart's French mistress.

366
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,390
When he broke off the affair,
rather badly I'm afraid,

367
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,430
she didn't tell him she was pregnant.

368
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,140
And even when Bart found out he had a son,

369
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,390
she wouldn't let him see him.

370
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,400
- That must have been very hard for him.

371
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,450
- Yeah, Jean Philippe was his only child,

372
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,700
it broke his heart, but
six months before Bart died

373
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,980
of lung cancer, Jean Vieve
died in a car accident

374
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,600
and he sent me over to
France to bring his boy home,

375
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,810
and that, that meant everything to Bart.

376
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,810
To have his son beside him when he died.

377
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,250
- Speaking of sons, you
know Ruth's son don't you?

378
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,140
- JR yeah, I've known him for years.

379
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,320
- Nice kid?

380
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,263
- Yeah, JR's got a good heart.

381
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,600
He's made some stupid
choices that have landed him

382
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,840
in hot water more then once,
but we kept his record clean.

383
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,130
Why do you ask?

384
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,730
- He's just dropped out of sight,

385
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,050
he's not returning his mothers calls.

386
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,520
- No idea where he is?

387
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,353
- None.

388
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,470
Is there anything you know that she should

389
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,703
be concerned about?

390
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,410
- I haven't spoken to JR in months,

391
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,260
I was hoping he'd cleaned up his act.

392
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,303
- That hot water you
mentioned, how hot was it?

393
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,103
- Very.

394
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:22,426
(gentle tinkling music)

395
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:52,270
- Oh good this is the police station.

396
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,230
- Ma'am.

397
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,310
- In New York most police
stations look like bomb shelters.

398
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,370
This building looked so quaint

399
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,220
I thought it might be another
boutique or something.

400
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,230
- How can I help you ma'am?

401
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,580
- Sorry, right, I know it's late

402
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,430
but I'm worried about the
son of a friend of mine.

403
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,350
Well actually we just met today,

404
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,000
but I feel connected on
a woman to woman level,

405
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,200
if you know what I mean.

406
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Probably not, which is
probably a good thing.

407
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,520
But what's important is that
she can't locate the boy.

408
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,651
- Well if it's her son,
why isn't she here,

409
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:25,484
instead of you?

410
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:26,590
- Oh, she doesn't know that I came.

411
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,650
- But a relative or a spouse has to file

412
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,100
a missing person report.

413
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,170
- Well here's the rub, we don't know

414
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,370
if he really is missing.

415
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,380
- Then why are you here?

416
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,710
- Because he might be missing.

417
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,480
- Ma'am I can't file a might
be missing person report.

418
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,750
- Isn't there someone else here

419
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,340
that I could talk too about this?

420
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,580
- The only officer on duty is --

421
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,560
- Saying sayonara.

422
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,230
- It's you, you can't leave.

423
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,164
- Watch me.

424
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,913
- I, I need to talk to you.

425
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,293
It's about Ruth's son JR,

426
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,695
I don't know but I think he
might have been murdered.

427
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,528
- Murdered?
- Murdered?

428
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,197
- Murdered.

429
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:12,730
At first I thought it was
a wine stain on the rug

430
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,310
so I pulled out a can of shaving cream.

431
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,740
- Shaving cream?

432
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,490
- It's great for getting
stains out, magic.

433
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,923
Sort of like oatmeal for razor burn.

434
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,190
Anyway, when I was down there on the floor

435
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,410
I noticed this on the table leg.

436
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,930
- And this is?

437
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,180
- Blood.

438
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,050
- Alleged blood.

439
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,093
- Oh it's blood.

440
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,100
Which tells me that the stain
on the rug was blood as well.

441
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,160
- I'll probably regret
this but okay I'll bite,

442
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,740
who's blood do you think this is?

443
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,118
- JR's, he's the only
one who lives there so.

444
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:49,950
- Maybe he cut himself shaving.

445
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,380
- No, somebody bashed him on
the head with a candlestick.

446
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,550
- A candlestick.

447
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,880
- I saw it at the house, it was wooden,

448
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,186
heavy, sharp edges, I mean
it could do as much damage

449
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:03,480
as falling off a motorcycle.

450
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,540
You don't really ride those do you?

451
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,373
- I really do.

452
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,050
- You don't have children I hope.

453
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,150
- Look, can we stay focused here.

454
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,820
Who would this someone be?

455
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,540
- The same person that rubbed shoe polish

456
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,760
on the candlestick.

457
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,770
When the candlestick hit JR's head,

458
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,610
the impact made gouges in the candlestick.

459
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,263
Someone used shoe polish
to conceal the gouges.

460
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,060
- Why not just take the candlestick?

461
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,790
- Because if someone
noticed it was missing,

462
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,786
they might start asking why.

463
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:35,900
Better to leave it in plain sight,

464
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,820
so it looks like nothing ever happened.

465
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,283
That's why the kitchen was neat as a pin.

466
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,180
- The kitchen was neat,
and this is important?

467
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,655
- The murderer didn't want it to look like

468
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:48,650
someone had been killed there.

469
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,250
- So the alleged murderer
cleared the table,

470
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,280
and washed the dishes, after he allegedly

471
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,540
killed the kid with the candlestick.

472
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,130
- You're catching on.
(clicks fingers)

473
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,400
Except for the alleged part,
but we'll work on that.

474
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,750
- Why kill JR in the first place?

475
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,120
- Oh, he had a little
trouble when he was younger,

476
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,380
hot water.

477
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,950
- What makes you think that?

478
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,160
- I have a source.

479
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,063
- A source.

480
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,700
You've been here 12 hours,
and you have a source.

481
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,643
- Fine, don't believe me.

482
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:23,230
(gentle tinkling music)

483
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,380
- Let's see what JR's
got on his rap sheet.

484
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,230
At 10 he got busted for breaking

485
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,963
Christmas lights at the YMCA.

486
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,913
14, he pinched a kids bike
and took it for a joyride.

487
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,540
16, he lit a bag of dog crap on fire

488
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,073
on the principles front porch.

489
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,530
Wow, public enemy number one.

490
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,790
- Maybe he had a good lawyer,

491
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,220
who kept the hot water off his record.

492
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,060
- JR lives outside city limits,

493
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,940
the County Sheriff handles
everything out there.

494
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,430
- Well then why don't you
call the County Sheriff?

495
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,950
- And what am I gonna say,

496
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,160
yo, I got this kid, he doesn't call home,

497
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,630
I'm think he got whacked by a candlestick.

498
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,873
You got a body, evidence,
leads, motive, anything?

499
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:14,820
Well I'm a little light on details,

500
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,597
but I do know that the murderer

501
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:18,790
was a heck of a house cleaner.

502
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm dyin' to make that call.

503
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,222
- Fine I'll make it, I'm not shy.

504
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:23,893
- Really, I hadn't noticed.

505
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,260
Leave the red stuff.

506
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,093
- The blood.

507
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,430
- Whatever, I'll have
the lab check it out,

508
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,360
if it is JR's blood,
maybe I'll have something

509
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,140
to talk to the Sheriffs office about.

510
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,973
- Hmm.

511
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:39,433
Someone should be arrested
for making coffee this bad.

512
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,673
- We had to fire our barista, budget cuts.

513
00:26:41,673 --> 00:26:43,380
- Just add some salt and some nutmeg

514
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,120
before you brew the coffee,
take all the bitterness out.

515
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,053
- We like bitter, it keeps us mean.

516
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,520
You haven't mentioned
this to Ruth have you?

517
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,020
- No I didn't want to upset her.

518
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,950
- Me either, you're on
vacation up here, so vacation.

519
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,159
Sleep, shop, work on your tan.

520
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,490
- Should I get my nails
done as well, manipedi.

521
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,850
- Yeah, that works, just
don't try to be a cop.

522
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,090
- Oh, absolutely not,
wouldn't dream of it,

523
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,963
not for a nano.

524
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:22,801
(phone dialing)
(gentle tinkling music)

525
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:34,723
(phone ringing)

526
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,833
- Nigel Forsythe the third.

527
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,163
- Nigel it's me.

528
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,563
- Oh hey me, it's me too.

529
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,660
Well actually it's me three isn't it,

530
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,380
because I am the third after all.

531
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,180
- It's the middle of the
night, what are you doing?

532
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,550
- I'm working, you know me,

533
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,160
nose to the old grindstone 24/7.

534
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,313
- Working on what?

535
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:00,533
- A Pru Pointer on vodka
that we talked about.

536
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,730
I had no idea, it turns out,

537
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,860
that vodka is one of the
wonders of the world.

538
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,940
It's, it's, it's just
amazing what it can do.

539
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,882
Did, did you know that it's
a great facial cleaner.

540
00:28:11,882 --> 00:28:13,760
You just, you just rub it on your face

541
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,150
and squeaky clean pores bingo.

542
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,890
- You silly twit, you're
absorbing the alcohol

543
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,010
through your skin, you're
as drunk as a loon.

544
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,260
- How drunk do loons get?

545
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,610
- Never mind, look, I want
you to come to Wyoming.

546
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,200
- You're on vacation,
what do you need me for?

547
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,380
- I miss you.

548
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,370
- Oh come on, you don't miss anyone.

549
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,050
- Whatever, take three
aspirin, pack a bag,

550
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,883
and get on a plane.

551
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:37,716
- Do I have too?

552
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,373
I'd hate to interrupt this
very, very important research.

553
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,750
Oh, did you know that vodka is excellent

554
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,650
for cleaning the hair off your tongue?

555
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,340
- Good morning Prudence.

556
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,500
- Good morning.

557
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,800
- Ready for some breakfast?

558
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
- Yes I am, did JR call?

559
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,633
- No.

560
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,140
- Ruth I'm curious, when
my mother came to stay here

561
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,170
did you ever have a chance to talk to her?

562
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,790
- A little, when she wasn't too busy.

563
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,393
- Of course, her work.

564
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,543
- No, she hardly worked when she was here.

565
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,253
- Really, what did she do?

566
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,720
- I think she enjoyed herself.

567
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,683
- Enjoyed herself.

568
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,150
All I ever remember is her working.

569
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,834
I mean, I knew what she was, a columnist,

570
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:34,313
a sort of celebrity but I
never really knew who she was,

571
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,883
not as a woman really.

572
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:41,370
- I didn't know her that
well, but I do remember this.

573
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,793
When she was happy, everybody
around her was happy too.

574
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,600
- What made her happy?

575
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,793
- Just a moment.

576
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,340
This belonged to your mother,

577
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,010
she wanted it kept here at the lodge,

578
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,055
even after she was gone.

579
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,410
- Why?

580
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,190
- I'm not sure, maybe
it's because the lodge

581
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,993
held so many fond memories for her.

582
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,621
(gentle music)

583
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,160
- There are dozens of
letters in this box Ruth.

584
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,660
Written by someone who had
to have been her lover.

585
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:59,043
I mean they're so beautiful and romantic.

586
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,853
My mother had a lover, my God.

587
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,680
I mean, do you have any
idea who wrote these?

588
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,305
- No, she didn't talk
to me about such things.

589
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:13,703
(gong chiming)
Excuse me.

590
00:31:23,737 --> 00:31:26,487
(Ruth screaming)

591
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:33,038
(somber music)

592
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:50,667
- Ruth?

593
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:53,699
- JR.

594
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,673
- I'm detective Jilson,
County Sheriffs department.

595
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,440
Some hikers found Mrs Vigil's son

596
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,010
out at Diablo Canyon, he'd
er, fallen from a hiking trail

597
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,150
near the summit.

598
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:12,021
- (crying) He, he's dead Prudence.

599
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:14,704
JR's dead.

600
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:33,063
Hikers found this suicide
note on the mountain.

601
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,983
- Oh my God.

602
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,493
- Doesn't make sense.

603
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,690
JR had his ups and downs
just like anybody else.

604
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,990
He loved his life, he
wouldn't have wasted it,

605
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,820
especially not like this.

606
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:49,360
- What do you mean?

607
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,370
- JR was terrified of
heights, he hated to fly,

608
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,833
he wouldn't even ride in an elevator.

609
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,250
Why would he climb a mountain too --

610
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,350
- I have no clue.

611
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,880
- Well aren't you suspicious?

612
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,150
I mean this doesn't make sense.

613
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,690
- Most of life doesn't make sense,

614
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,270
starting with the big bang.

615
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,930
- JR didn't jump.

616
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,780
- A lot of people think he did.

617
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,830
- Is the coroner going to do an autopsy?

618
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,030
- Coroners don't usually
do autopsies on suicides,

619
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,590
especially where the
cause of death is obvious.

620
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,275
- Where is Diablo Canyon?

621
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,653
- West of town, why?

622
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,300
- We should start our investigation there.

623
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,830
- What investigation?

624
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,480
- Find out who murdered Ruth's son.

625
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,890
- We went over this already.

626
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,860
- We did.

627
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,310
- We did, but read my lips again,

628
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,860
this is out of my jurisdiction.

629
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,440
- Guess what I don't have a jurisdiction,

630
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,350
I'll go there myself.

631
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,990
- No you won't you go
out there by yourself,

632
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,597
you'll get lost, you'll die.

633
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:45,840
Your bones will be
picked clean by vultures.

634
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,660
- Hmm, sounds like an after
Christmas sale in New York.

635
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,800
- Even worse, I'll have to
write the whole sordid mess up.

636
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,753
- Why, the sordid mess won't
be in your jurisdiction?

637
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:59,810
- (sighs) I'll get the Sheriffs
report off the internet

638
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,643
and drive you.

639
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,850
- Not on that I hope.

640
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,520
- You ever been on a bike?

641
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,763
- Never, I'm just not that
keen to be an organ donor.

642
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,720
- Then you haven't lived.

643
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,290
- If I rode a motorcycle I'd be living?

644
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,090
- Well it would be a start.

645
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,133
I'll get the car, you'll need
some decent hiking shoes.

646
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,310
- Oh these are fine, I'm a New Yorker,

647
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,160
we walk anywhere.

648
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,090
Besides we need to be at
the airport in 20 minutes.

649
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,923
- Why?

650
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:38,966
- Come on.

651
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:42,216
(equipment clattering)

652
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:50,812
- Oh there he is, hello Nigel.

653
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,460
- This is like a gag right?

654
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,570
- No gag, that's Nigel.

655
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,320
- Why is he rubbing his head with a lemon?

656
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,653
- It cures headaches.

657
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,313
I'm afraid he has a wicked hangover.

658
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,483
- This guy actually works for you?

659
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,320
- He runs my lab.

660
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,493
He'll be a lot of help
in the investigation.

661
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,993
He's very talented.

662
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,213
- At what?

663
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:26,575
(Pru panting heavily)

664
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,330
- I feel like a bloody mountain goat,

665
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,450
why can't we drive up here?

666
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,540
- You need four wheel drive,

667
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,090
and I thought New Yorkers like to walk.

668
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,950
- This isn't a walk, it's a death march.

669
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,000
- We're almost there.

670
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,650
- You're enjoying this aren't you?

671
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:58,710
(Pru grunting and panting)

672
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,377
(river running)

673
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:08,020
- This is where the hikers
found JR's suicide note.

674
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,853
- Okay.

675
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,236
- He came down the hillside right there,

676
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,850
crossed to the edge, and jumped from here.

677
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,370
Yellow police tape at
the bottom of the cliff

678
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,603
is where the hikers found the body.

679
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,400
- He was terrified of heights,

680
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,880
he would never have
tried to commit suicide

681
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,560
by jumping off a mountain.

682
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,410
- He left a suicide note here,

683
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,400
they found the body down
there, connect the dots.

684
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,770
- Did you see the note?

685
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,603
- No.

686
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:37,180
- Well I did, it was typed.

687
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,990
I mean who types a suicide note.

688
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,330
- Methodical, organized people.

689
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,620
- If that's where they found the body,

690
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,870
he didn't jump from here.

691
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,000
- How'd he get there, fly?

692
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,470
- He was pushed, or he was unconscious,

693
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,203
or you know worse he was
dropped over the edge.

694
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,890
- What are you talkin' about?

695
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,810
- If he'd jumped out from the cliff

696
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,980
then he would have missed that
rock outcropping completely

697
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,760
and he would have landed,
right there by that tree.

698
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,440
But if he'd been pushed or dumped,

699
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,750
then he would have hit the outcropping

700
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,920
which would have altered
the trajectory of his fall,

701
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,560
and he would have landed
you know, duh duh duh,

702
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,900
right where they found the body.

703
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,920
- Nigel you're brilliant,
didn't I tell you

704
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,770
he was brilliant.

705
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,923
- Too many times.

706
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,373
Look, if the kid was afraid of heights,

707
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,020
I'm guessing he didn't
just come take a swan dive

708
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,660
from the cliff.

709
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,060
He probably inched out to
the edge, took a deep breath,

710
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,190
looked out, said a hail Mary and dropped.

711
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,950
Hit the rock outcropping on the way down,

712
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,023
and landed right where he was found.

713
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,600
- Not bad, but wrong.

714
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,010
- Wrong, I've been a
detective for, I don't know,

715
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,310
25 years, you've been a
detective for lets see,

716
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,193
for never.

717
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,443
- Prudence, look at this.

718
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,200
- What did you find?

719
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,730
- Boot prints, someone came down this hill

720
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,100
and then walked back up again,

721
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,683
and it looks like they
were wearing cowboy boots.

722
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,020
- Nigel found cowboy boot prints.

723
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,290
- Cowboy boots in
Wyoming, wow the kids hot.

724
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,850
- The prints coming down the hill

725
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,180
are an average 57% deeper, and 33% wider

726
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,170
than the boot prints
going back up the hill.

727
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,560
- So someone was heavier
coming down the hill,

728
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,850
then going back up, so what?

729
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,680
- Well apart from the
incredible crash diet,

730
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,560
how else would you explain
the sudden weight loss?

731
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,070
- This is a camping
area, someone came down

732
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,640
carrying something heavy like a backpack

733
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,710
full of food, water, fishing gear --

734
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,870
- Or a body that they pushed,

735
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,440
or dumped off the cliff,

736
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,010
and then they walked
right back up the hill.

737
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,450
- Limped, the boot prints indicate a limp,

738
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,710
favoring the right leg.

739
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,590
- Those prints disappear way before

740
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,650
you get to the cliff.

741
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,520
- Because there's rock there, not mud.

742
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,070
- Fine, but whoever came down the hill

743
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,940
could have gone anywhere from there.

744
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,716
- Not with a body, dead weight
is very difficult to carry.

745
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:03,400
- (laughs) Whatever, we're done here.

746
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,750
Go on up to the top of the hill,

747
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,353
I'll get the car and meet yah.

748
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:08,077
- The car, I thought you told me

749
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,290
you couldn't drive up here.

750
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,090
- I said we needed four wheel drive,

751
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,634
I have four wheel drive.

752
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:17,134
(phone rings)

753
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:20,800
- I can't believe this, he made us walk

754
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,250
all the way up here
just because I wouldn't

755
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,510
follow his advice and change my shoes.

756
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,993
I mean it's just so
bloody childish isn't it.

757
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,020
- Your feet must be killing you,

758
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,743
why didn't you just change your shoes?

759
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,820
- Because I didn't want to, did I.

760
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,040
- Wow, now that is totally childish.

761
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,540
- Mind your own beeswax Nigel.

762
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:41,790
- The lab results on your
blood sample came back.

763
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,010
- And?

764
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,330
- You were right, it's blood.

765
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,010
- Yes, I knew it, I could feel it.

766
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,082
I had this sixth sense,
you know what I mean.

767
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:50,610
Detectives, the really good ones,

768
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,780
they must have that sort
of feeling all the time.

769
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,800
- It wasn't JR's blood type.

770
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,573
His is AB negative, the blood
in his house is O positive.

771
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,840
- The murderers, JR resisted, he got cut.

772
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,920
- Assuming there is a murderer.

773
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,410
Which means 35% of the entire population

774
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,853
are now suspects, this
pig doesn't have wings.

775
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,303
- Pardon.
- Doesn't fly.

776
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:25,105
(gentle somber music)

777
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,273
- I'm sorry.

778
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,070
- I know how this sounds but,

779
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:09,450
I don't think JR committed suicide.

780
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,290
- What are you talking about?

781
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,470
- I think somebody killed him,

782
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,970
and tried to make it look like a suicide.

783
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,640
- Who'd do that, why?

784
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,473
- I don't know.

785
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,465
- Have you told the police?

786
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:24,683
- A detective here in town,
he doesn't take me seriously.

787
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,450
- Do you have any proof, any evidence?

788
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,803
- Some, but not enough to
convince the police, not yet.

789
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,980
- You haven't told any
of this to Ruth have yah?

790
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,830
- No, no, I didn't want to upset her.

791
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,040
- Listen I have some contacts
at the Sheriffs office,

792
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,861
I'll make a few calls discreetly
and see what I can find.

793
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:42,787
- That's fantastic.

794
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:44,687
- And if you find anything run it past me

795
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:47,160
and I'll make sure those police
don't brush you off okay.

796
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,653
- Absolutely.
- Alright.

797
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,950
Listen you're very kind to be
concerned about Ruth and JR.

798
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,120
- So are you, thank you.

799
00:41:57,638 --> 00:42:00,721
(car engine revving)

800
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,130
- Is it really necessary that I'm here?

801
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,760
- Of course, I'm working,
you're my assistant aren't you?

802
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,910
- Well yeah, granted, but
work doesn't usually involve

803
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,313
tryin' to solve murders.

804
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:35,890
(he laughs)

805
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,630
- Ah, shoe polish, my
grandfather developed

806
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,950
that pointer for your mom.

807
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,470
- Forsythe the first was brilliant.

808
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,880
- The first solved household problems like

809
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,150
Mozart wrote symphonies, I
stand humbly on the shoulders

810
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,983
of that giant.

811
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,320
Okay, okay, what are we looking for?

812
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,630
- Something that might tell
us what happened to JR.

813
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,722
- I'll check the bedroom.

814
00:42:59,722 --> 00:43:00,555
- Okay.

815
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:07,480
(bouncy tinkling music)

816
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:02,642
(laughs) Eureka.

817
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,520
- What did you find?

818
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,237
- It's in French.

819
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:18,050
- I'm sorry I'm fluent in three languages,

820
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,880
can read another four, but French is

821
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:24,678
(speaking foreign language).

822
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:26,550
- What?

823
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,570
- It's German for, French
is a boring language

824
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,983
spoken by arrogant fools.

825
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,720
- The only French I know
should never be spoken

826
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,870
outside of the bedroom.

827
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,210
You know what petite moi means?

828
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,763
- No, no and knowing you I
don't wanna know, not ever.

829
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:44,240
- You're blushing.

830
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,547
- No I'm not.

831
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:47,410
- You're going red as a
beet, that's so adorable.

832
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,470
- Can we move on please.

833
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,610
Just look at these
pictures, there's photos

834
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,573
of a county map.

835
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,143
Maybe JR had an office somewhere.

836
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,960
- Hey, check out the window
reflected in this mirror.

837
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,793
You see the edge of that sign, TET.

838
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,950
We find that sign and we find this room.

839
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,329
- And you'll find it.

840
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:13,162
- Yavol.

841
00:45:16,107 --> 00:45:19,200
- Tassajaro, that's strange.

842
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,190
- Strange good, or strange bad?

843
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,470
- I don't know, anyway we've got a map,

844
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,260
we have a French document and
we have the lead on an office.

845
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,830
We're on a roll Nigel.

846
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,840
- Oh great, any idea what
direction we're rolling in?

847
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,960
- We'll go to the Sheriffs office.

848
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,750
- Drop me off at the lodge,
I've had my outing for the day.

849
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,870
- What are you afraid off?

850
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,883
- You arguing with the
Sheriff, me going to jail.

851
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:48,177
(light dramatic music)

852
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,460
- That's a candlestick Miss McCoy.

853
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,003
- And a murder weapon.

854
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,870
- JR Vigil wasn't murdered.

855
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,207
- Well there's a growing body of evidence,

856
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,950
that says that he was.

857
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,900
- Body of evidence.

858
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,363
- Well, maybe not a body but,

859
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,630
there are a lot of people who
believe that he was murdered,

860
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,463
professionals.

861
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:30,530
- What sort of professionals?

862
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,170
- Well a prominent lawyer in town,

863
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,060
and Detective Duncan.

864
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,490
- Duncan buys this candlestick idea?

865
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,900
- Detective Duncan's very intrigued.

866
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,163
See the gouges.

867
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,853
- And?

868
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,330
- I know Ruth Vigil asked that an autopsy

869
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,100
be performed on her son.

870
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,220
- Yes ma'am she did.

871
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,190
- All you have to do is
examine the coroners report.

872
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,780
If there was trauma to JR's head.

873
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,500
- The boy fell 300 feet
down the side of a mountain.

874
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,690
There's head trauma, a lot of it.

875
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,240
- The forensic experts will
see that the head wounds

876
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,360
could only have been
caused by this candlestick.

877
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,156
- You seem pretty sure about this.

878
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:07,989
- I am.

879
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,160
If I'm wrong I'll give your wife Corki

880
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,003
an autographed Pru Pointers t-shirt.

881
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,877
- Pru Pointer, you're,
you're that Prudence.

882
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:22,526
- That's right.

883
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:23,359
(bangs desk)
(laughs)

884
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,890
your wife's one of my biggest fans.

885
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,360
- Yeah, yeah.

886
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,330
- So how's the snoring problem?

887
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:31,560
- My, (laughs) cured.

888
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,690
That tennis ball you had
Corki sew into my pajamas,

889
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,150
keeps me from rolling over.

890
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,473
- Nigel my assistant
came up with that one.

891
00:47:37,473 --> 00:47:39,233
- Well he's a damn genius.

892
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,664
Alright, I'll have forensics
check out the candlestick.

893
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:46,730
- Fantastic.

894
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,933
- But I've got one other little problem.

895
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,853
My hunting dog, Rufus.

896
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:57,820
- Ah.
- He's got gas,

897
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,223
bad gas, we've had to
fumigate the house twice.

898
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,487
We really need your help on this one,

899
00:48:03,487 --> 00:48:04,653
you got any ideas?

900
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,200
- Put half a cup of plain
yogurt in Rufus' dog food,

901
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,763
twice daily, it'll deflate him.

902
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,330
- (laughs) Yogurt?
- Hmm.

903
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,000
- That works, you might
have just saved my marriage.

904
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,950
I thought I was gonna have
to choose between Corki

905
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:21,783
and Rufus.

906
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,460
- Would that have been hard to do?

907
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,293
- Well,

908
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,243
Rufus is a damn good bird dog.

909
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:35,382
(light bouncy music)

910
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,743
- I just faxed it to you,
a document of some kind.

911
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,030
No, don't fly out Francoise,

912
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,230
I just want you to
translate it and call me.

913
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:53,003
Yeah, I miss you too, kiss kiss.

914
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,873
Headache?
- A killer.

915
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,933
Eddie was here, he talked
to Jilson about your visit,

916
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:02,310
he's not a happy camper.

917
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,450
- No, gee I'm so sorry about that.

918
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,570
- He said he want's you to chill.

919
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,180
- Chill, what am I a bottle of chardonnay,

920
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,740
he has a bloody nerve.

921
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,573
- Please, just don't start,
I think I found the room.

922
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,310
Here, the lettering looked commercial

923
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,690
So I searched local business names,

924
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,463
all with the letters T, E
and T in them in that order.

925
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:27,220
I turned up with like dozens of them,

926
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,820
all with the word teton in them.

927
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,310
- Why teton?

928
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:34,680
- Oh because the Grand Tetons,
the mountains were named

929
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,730
by the French explorers who
called the three highest peaks

930
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:42,363
of the range le trois Teton,
the three breasts, or nipples.

931
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,443
You know, depending on the translation.

932
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,440
So I figured that if JR kept
some sort of secret hideaway

933
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,613
that he wouldn't choose an auto
mechanic or a dry cleaners.

934
00:49:55,613 --> 00:49:56,584
- A motel.

935
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:59,850
- Oh no, no actually I think
he would choose a motel.

936
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,040
- That's what I mean, do
you have a name, address?

937
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,320
- Naturally, there's only
one motel with the name

938
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,100
that matches the letters in that photo,

939
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,053
the Teton Chalet Motel.

940
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,330
- Well it's definitely the same sign.

941
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:15,410
- Hmm, okay, now we just find a window

942
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,130
that looks out on the
sign at the same angle.

943
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,830
There's only three, piece of cake.

944
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,683
No.

945
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,363
(car engine rumbles)

946
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:39,456
(light, bouncy music)

947
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,152
- I think that worked.

948
00:50:57,172 --> 00:50:58,643
We can't look suspicious.

949
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:02,730
- (laughs) You don't
think that that, that,

950
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:03,600
- It's called a kiss.

951
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,930
- Moment, just made us
look totally suspicious.

952
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,690
I mean what kind of people
just kiss each other like that

953
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:10,610
in the middle of the day.

954
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,223
- People who come to places like this.

955
00:51:12,223 --> 00:51:13,056
- Oh.

956
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,640
This is the same window as in the picture.

957
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,613
- Are you sure?

958
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:29,360
- Yeah, absolutely, yeah it's
basic euclidean geometry,

959
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,760
the cosine of the angle formed
by the sine in the window

960
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,480
frame in conjunction with
the slope of the shadows

961
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,110
cast by the setting sun and --

962
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,810
- You're making all this up right?

963
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:41,003
- Pretty much.

964
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,170
- So how are you sure
this is the same window?

965
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,803
- You can see the map on the wall.

966
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,263
- Liquid dish washing detergent.

967
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,333
Nigel, dish washing detergent.

968
00:52:06,563 --> 00:52:08,090
Hair pins.

969
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,670
Pencil.

970
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,763
Straw, now cover me.

971
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:20,972
(lock clicks open)

972
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:21,805
Bingo.

973
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,463
Nigel, check out the laptop.

974
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:46,070
There's the sign, and
the map to Tassajaro.

975
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,880
- This is JR's computer,
the case has his name

976
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,580
and address on it.

977
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,610
- Why would JR have a map of Tassajaro?

978
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,433
And I wonder what those
X's on the map mean.

979
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:08,731
(car door slams shut)

980
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,250
- JR flew to Paris last month.

981
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,190
- Well that explains the French document,

982
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,890
see what else you can
find, take the computer,

983
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,033
I'll check upstairs.

984
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:33,003
(dramatic music)

985
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:39,730
(knocking on door)
(doorknob rattling)

986
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,793
- No housekeeping, thanks.

987
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:46,306
(muffled gunshot)

988
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,843
Prudence.

989
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:52,843
(banging on door)
- Go out the back.

990
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,884
(muffled gunshot)

991
00:53:55,884 --> 00:53:57,634
- There's no way out!

992
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:01,142
- Get the table lamp.

993
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:06,529
(Nigel screams)

994
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:07,362
Hit him.

995
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:14,406
(Man groaning in pain)

996
00:54:16,116 --> 00:54:17,949
Stay down you plonker.

997
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:26,047
(car engine revving)
(tires squealing)

998
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:38,163
(both breathing heavily)

999
00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:39,690
Why can't I ever remember
that bloody mantra

1000
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,523
when I need it?

1001
00:54:40,523 --> 00:54:42,560
- Just forget your mantra,
just call the police

1002
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,990
and report an attempted murder.

1003
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,420
- Are you daft Nigel, we
can't call the police.

1004
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,253
- Why not?

1005
00:54:47,253 --> 00:54:48,620
- Because I'm not
interested in being arrested

1006
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,720
for the several serious
crimes we just committed.

1007
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,000
- Serious crimes, what are you --

1008
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,600
- Breaking and entering, larceny,

1009
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,689
assault and battery.

1010
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:55,920
- Oh God.

1011
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,160
- Although I'd certainly argue

1012
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,587
bashing that wanker was in self defense.

1013
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,460
- Of course it was self defense,

1014
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,260
he was trying to kill us.

1015
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,940
What makes you think
he won't try it again?

1016
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,705
- I don't, he could.

1017
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:09,020
(phone ringing)

1018
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:14,020
Hello, Jeffrey, oh, what are we doing?

1019
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,880
Well I mean a lot of things, relaxing,

1020
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,597
reading, meeting people,
having adventures.

1021
00:55:21,597 --> 00:55:22,430
(Nigel groans)

1022
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,130
For example, someone just
tried to kill Nigel and me,

1023
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,730
there were bullets
flying, glass shattering.

1024
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,890
- [Jeffrey] What are you talking about,

1025
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,035
who tried to kill you?

1026
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,671
What in God's name are
you doing out there,

1027
00:55:30,671 --> 00:55:31,668
you're supposed to be on vacation.

1028
00:55:31,668 --> 00:55:32,923
(police siren wailing)

1029
00:55:32,923 --> 00:55:33,756
You're supposed to rest
and relax, not get shot at.

1030
00:55:33,756 --> 00:55:35,910
- Gotta run love, we're being
pulled over by the police.

1031
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,910
I'll call you if I need a solicitor.

1032
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,797
Just shove everything under the seat,

1033
00:55:39,797 --> 00:55:41,113
and don't open your mouth.

1034
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:54,357
(suspenseful music)

1035
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,773
- Ma'am.

1036
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:04,603
- Hello detective, so
how are things at home?

1037
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:07,640
- Well Corki has loaded up on yogurt,

1038
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,880
so we'll keep our fingers crossed.

1039
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,210
But things aren't nearly as promising

1040
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,810
out at the Teton Chalet Motel.

1041
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,430
Someone shot up one of the units real bad.

1042
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,070
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would yah?

1043
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,823
- Goodness no, no, I'm terrified of guns.

1044
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,610
- Maid saw a car leaving the scene,

1045
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,100
she didn't get a license
plate but your car

1046
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,270
matches her description.

1047
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,993
- Oh, that's impossible detective,

1048
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:33,160
we've been out admiring
your gorgeous mountains,

1049
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,010
haven't we Nigel?

1050
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,390
Bloody massive your Tetons.

1051
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,542
- I got the forensics
back on your candlestick.

1052
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,430
- And?

1053
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,880
- The gouges match the
head trauma on the victim,

1054
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,340
and the wood splinters that
we found in the head wounds

1055
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,460
match the candlestick.

1056
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,010
- So he was murdered?

1057
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,030
- It's a little early to say for sure,

1058
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,310
but it looks that way.

1059
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,640
Now if you have any information.

1060
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,473
- Actually --

1061
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:56,270
- We don't have a thing, but
if the candlestick helped

1062
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,940
we're delighted to have
made a contribution

1063
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,260
towards the preservation of
law and order in Wyoming.

1064
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,093
Aren't we Nigel.

1065
00:57:01,093 --> 00:57:02,180
- Ah, yeah, we're thrilled.

1066
00:57:03,209 --> 00:57:04,610
- When are you folks headin' home?

1067
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,520
- As soon as possible.

1068
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,620
- That's probably a real good idea, ma'am.

1069
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:15,800
- Ah, oh, that hurts so
much, why did you pinch me?

1070
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,890
- I told you not to talk,

1071
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,093
you're lucky I didn't cut your tongue out.

1072
00:57:20,093 --> 00:57:23,577
(Nigel groans in pain)

1073
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:27,077
(light suspenseful music)

1074
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,210
- JR put those marking
on the map for a reason,

1075
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,313
call me crazy but I want to know why.

1076
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:52,350
(grunting in pain)

1077
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,690
- Oh no, look I'm really
flattered really I am,

1078
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:56,270
but
- Shut up.

1079
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:57,640
- I'd feel terrible if we did anything

1080
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,337
to jeopardize our
professional relationship.

1081
00:57:59,337 --> 00:58:01,310
- How would you feel if we were killed?

1082
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,510
- Really bad, why?

1083
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,460
- There's two guys over there,
I don't want them to see us.

1084
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:11,060
You see that truck up there,

1085
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:13,530
I want to get a closer look at it.

1086
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,590
- I've got some binoculars.

1087
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,730
- No, not from up here, from down there.

1088
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:20,153
- How did I know you were gonna say that.

1089
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:49,540
We've broken so many laws
already I'm getting confused.

1090
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,350
Is this breaking and
entering, or trespassing?

1091
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,150
- It's being nosy, it's
not against the law,

1092
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,290
so watch my back.

1093
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:03,368
(metal clanking)

1094
00:59:03,368 --> 00:59:06,763
- Okay leave it, leave it,
those guys are coming back.

1095
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:08,930
Come on, come on, come on.

1096
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,837
(car engine rumbling)

1097
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,127
(alarm beeping)

1098
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,930
- Nigel come here.

1099
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,240
These holes match the
markings on JR's map.

1100
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,220
Now for some reason they
were important to JR,

1101
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,610
and to those two guys.

1102
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:29,331
I mean they were trying
to hide every one of them.

1103
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:31,740
Here what do you think this is?

1104
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,540
- It's trip wire for dynamite,

1105
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,120
that's what caused all these holes.

1106
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,080
- Who'd want to explode dynamite out here?

1107
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,270
- Someone who's looking for oil.

1108
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:41,170
Look I went online, I
Googled Blacks International,

1109
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,100
it's an oil exploration
company, oil geologists.

1110
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,380
They drill shot holes,
stuff dynamite into them,

1111
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,870
blow it up and then use
the reflected sound waves

1112
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:50,870
to map the subterranean structure.

1113
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,340
- Okay is this real or
is this more of your

1114
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,890
euclidean cosine nonsense?

1115
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:57,860
- No, no, that's how
it's done, Google again.

1116
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,610
JR obviously knew someone
was looking for oil out here.

1117
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,670
- My guess is someone wasn't very happy

1118
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,233
that he knew about it.

1119
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,991
(keyboard clicking)

1120
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:21,310
- Alright fine, just play hard to get,

1121
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,600
it's just a matter of time,
can't keep me out forever.

1122
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,350
- Nigel you've gotta hear this one.

1123
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,940
I hated to see the night
end, I wanted to be with you

1124
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:35,593
warm and soft in my arms
until the end of time.

1125
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,700
Till the end of time, I mean who writes

1126
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,323
such pathetic poppycock.

1127
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,990
- Someone who adores your mother.

1128
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,010
How many letters are there?

1129
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,950
- Oh, dozens and dozens,
they're so saccharin,

1130
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,150
they make my teeth ache.

1131
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,613
- Are you okay?

1132
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:54,653
- I'm fine, splendid.

1133
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,590
- That's such a lie, you're crying.

1134
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,697
- Oh no, no, no, these are my allergies.

1135
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:02,563
- Allergies, what allergies.

1136
01:02:03,622 --> 01:02:06,289
(phone ringing)

1137
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,673
- Hello, oh hello.

1138
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:16,740
Um, not much, just solving
the worlds hunger crisis

1139
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,210
and fighting global warming.

1140
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:24,533
Tonight, no, I'm booked up.

1141
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:32,255
Let me check, um, I'm sorry
that's tomorrow night,

1142
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,803
tonight I'm free, yes, yes, I can.

1143
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,203
I'll see you there.

1144
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,500
- Who was that?

1145
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,900
- Oh, what's his name, the detective.

1146
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,850
- Jilson?

1147
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,270
- No, no the other one, Eddie.

1148
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,370
- Eddie asked you out.

1149
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,220
- For a talk and a drink.

1150
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,651
- Oh so this is why
it's like a date right.

1151
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:58,509
- No, no this is not a date.

1152
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:02,270
- A drink and a talk, hello
that is totally a date.

1153
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,983
- He's a bloody detective Nigel.

1154
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:10,558
(crickets chirping)
(owl hooting)

1155
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,740
Any luck?

1156
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,423
- I'll be in JR's computer
by the time you get back.

1157
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,140
Meanwhile, I managed to hack
into the County land records.

1158
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,280
Now except for Tassajaro,
every parcel of land

1159
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,283
on JR's map has been sold
in the last five years.

1160
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:34,196
- In the middle of
nowhere, who bought them?

1161
01:03:34,196 --> 01:03:37,310
- A dozen different companies,
but it gets interesting.

1162
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,630
Every single one of them is owned by

1163
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,880
a company called JDT Enterprises,

1164
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,260
incorporated in Gran Cayman's.

1165
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,510
- Sounds like some sort of shell company.

1166
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,063
- Aren't they all in the Cayman's.

1167
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,660
- See what you can find out about JDT.

1168
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:52,710
- I am already on it.

1169
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,660
- I've got to run.

1170
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,320
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't go out like that.

1171
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,660
- The outfit, too dressy.

1172
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,313
- The eyes, they're too red, too puffy.

1173
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,470
- Oh God you're right, how horrible.

1174
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,820
What have you got for the lizard eyes?

1175
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:18,130
- Cold teaspoons, slices
of cucumbers, wet teabags.

1176
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,953
- All the old standards,
not a good look at a bar.

1177
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:23,643
Have you got something a bit more subtle?

1178
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,483
- You want subtle, I have got subtle.

1179
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:32,320
Here rub some of this on
your eyes, repeat as needed.

1180
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,650
Don't get any on your lips.

1181
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:35,830
- What is this stuff?

1182
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,993
- It's hemorrhoid cream.

1183
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:42,629
(romantic piano music)

1184
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:27,649
(audience applauds)

1185
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:36,690
- You're early, I wanted to finish my set

1186
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:38,240
before you got here.

1187
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,063
- I didn't know what
traffic would be like.

1188
01:05:40,063 --> 01:05:42,710
- Good call, moose in
the middle of the road

1189
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,050
would hold up traffic for hours.

1190
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,610
- Exactly what I was worried about.

1191
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,943
- Look just so you know,
I tracked down the hikers

1192
01:05:48,943 --> 01:05:50,980
that found JR's body.

1193
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,813
- Really?

1194
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:54,370
- They saw an old truck on
the bluff where JR jumped.

1195
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,633
- Allegedly.

1196
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:03,000
- They also saw a guy
walking to the truck,

1197
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,590
he had a limp.

1198
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,840
- Told you.

1199
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,993
- Yes, you did.

1200
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:10,380
Hot sauce for silverware.

1201
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,623
- Hmm, takes the tarnish out.

1202
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:16,917
- Do you have a solution
for every single problem?

1203
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,093
- Well there are a few
I haven't figured out.

1204
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,700
Why did you want to finish
the set before I came?

1205
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,890
- I didn't think you'd be into jazz.

1206
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:37,040
- Well frankly, I never have been before,

1207
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,390
tonight was the first time.

1208
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,263
- Why tonight?

1209
01:06:41,883 --> 01:06:43,253
- I like watching you play,

1210
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:48,503
and you looked like you were
totally absorbed in the music.

1211
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,850
I can see why people like jazz.

1212
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,687
- Well it sneaks up on yah.

1213
01:06:59,957 --> 01:07:04,393
Before you realize it's
happening, it's got yah.

1214
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:10,800
(gentle romantic music)

1215
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:18,250
- I see what you mean.

1216
01:07:28,483 --> 01:07:30,033
- Maybe I better finish my set.

1217
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,240
Want to stick around for a while?

1218
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:39,501
- Why not, I'm on vacation.

1219
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:48,479
(crickets chirping)
(wolf howling)

1220
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:53,148
(trash cans rattling outside)

1221
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:56,398
(light dramatic music)

1222
01:08:03,935 --> 01:08:08,268
(slippers squeaking as Nigel walks)

1223
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:14,212
(trash cans rattling outside)

1224
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:34,214
(door knob rattling)
(Nigel gasps)

1225
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:07,210
(Nigel screams)

1226
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,160
What are you doing?

1227
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:12,557
- There was, there was
someone outside on the deck,

1228
01:09:12,557 --> 01:09:14,710
tell me it was you please, please.

1229
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:15,610
- I just got here.

1230
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,150
- It was the guy from the
motel, he's trying to kill us,

1231
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:22,820
again, why you know, what
have we ever done to him.

1232
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,750
You know, we don't even know him.

1233
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,030
How does he know about us, you know,

1234
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:28,430
I mean who are we, you know,

1235
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,280
we're just two nosy
people that should just

1236
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,124
mind their own business and this,

1237
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:34,701
I can't, I can't die yet, you know,

1238
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:37,800
I haven't even lived, I
want to fly like an eagle.

1239
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,633
Did you see anything?

1240
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:41,350
- Yes, he's still out
there, it's frightening.

1241
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,220
- What's he doing?

1242
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,650
- He's going through the garbage.

1243
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,000
- Why?

1244
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,100
- It's a raccoon, looking
for a midnight snack.

1245
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,009
Did I hear you say fly like an eagle?

1246
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:52,720
- I'm a huge Steve Miller fan.

1247
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,570
- Oh yes, of course you are.

1248
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,420
Any luck with the computer?

1249
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,453
- Oh yeah, of course,
that's not the problem.

1250
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,990
Each one of the files is encrypted.

1251
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,490
- Which means?

1252
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,323
- It won't be easy.

1253
01:10:05,323 --> 01:10:07,520
- Damn.
- However,

1254
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,940
one of the biggest files was labeled JDT.

1255
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,600
- The company that bought
the land around Tassajaro.

1256
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,120
- With an office in town,
and yes I have an address.

1257
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,600
2020, Bison Boulevard.

1258
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,353
Bison Boulevard, only in Wyoming.

1259
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,558
- You're brilliant.

1260
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:26,640
First thing in the morning we'll go

1261
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,620
and check out that office.

1262
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,993
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
did you lock the door?

1263
01:10:37,473 --> 01:10:39,525
(key clicks in the lock)

1264
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:40,358
- There.

1265
01:10:41,264 --> 01:10:44,395
Do you want me to tuck you in too.

1266
01:10:44,395 --> 01:10:47,839
(Nigel chuckles nervously)

1267
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:50,839
(suspenseful music)

1268
01:11:00,483 --> 01:11:02,680
- Door to door, 17 minutes.

1269
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,770
- Oh my God.

1270
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,182
- I'm very good with directions.

1271
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:06,580
- Not you Nigel, that blue truck.

1272
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,630
It's the same truck I
saw outside the motel,

1273
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,164
I'm sure of it.

1274
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:12,010
- You know what, I think I did too.

1275
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,880
- Eddie told me the hikers
that found JR at Diablo Canyon,

1276
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,200
saw a truck parked there,
the driver had a limp.

1277
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,663
- The killers here, at JDT, why?

1278
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,633
- That's what I'd like to know.

1279
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,620
We need to see what's
going on inside there.

1280
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,920
- Are you crazy, he tried to kill us.

1281
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,850
He obviously knows what
Prudence McCoy looks like.

1282
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,250
- Maybe we can see something
inside one of those windows.

1283
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,810
- Bad idea, one more move and
we will be eating hot lead.

1284
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:08,790
- Eating hot lead?

1285
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,270
- Whatever, look, look, you
can't do this, I'll go in.

1286
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:16,670
- You?
- Yeah, me.

1287
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,270
When I'm with you, no one
ever pays any attention to me,

1288
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,520
he'll never recognize me.

1289
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,513
- Well, if you see anything
interesting, record it.

1290
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:30,095
You're very brave Nigel.

1291
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,993
- (chuckles) Brave, I'm
so scared I could vomit.

1292
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,570
- Well just to be on the safe side

1293
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:39,170
we need to get you a cover of some kind.

1294
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:42,215
- You're right a cover,
what kind of cover?

1295
01:12:42,215 --> 01:12:45,298
(light bouncy music)

1296
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,300
- May I help you?

1297
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:07,639
- Oh, I'm delivering flowers.

1298
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,963
- I can see that, they're
awesome, who are they for?

1299
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,350
- Who are they for?

1300
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:19,890
That's a good question, who
do you think they're for?

1301
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,403
- Oh my gosh, he remembered my birthday.

1302
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,140
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, he
did, he did remember.

1303
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,140
- He totally acted like
he forgot this morning.

1304
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,787
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, he just you know,

1305
01:13:29,787 --> 01:13:31,383
he wanted to surprise you.

1306
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,210
- He did, is there a card?

1307
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,750
- No, no, there's no card, none, notta,

1308
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:42,550
he said that he wants
to tell you in person.

1309
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,010
- He is so sweet.

1310
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,030
- Isn't he, totally.

1311
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,330
- Just, just a second
okay, don't go anywhere.

1312
01:13:51,313 --> 01:13:53,980
(phone ringing)

1313
01:13:57,788 --> 01:13:59,455
- They're beautiful.

1314
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:04,956
The flowers, would you stop, I'm serious.

1315
01:14:06,097 --> 01:14:09,430
(muffled conversations)

1316
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,930
He so funny, he kept pretending

1317
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:31,587
like he didn't send anything.

1318
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:32,420
- (chuckles) Really.

1319
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,710
- But I so knew it was him.

1320
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,150
I hate it when he teases me like that,

1321
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:37,193
he's such a brat.

1322
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,973
- But a sweet brat, happy Birthday.

1323
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,643
- Wait, wait, wait, where are you going.

1324
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,833
You're hot.

1325
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,370
- I am?

1326
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,710
- Totally, call me,
maybe you could help me

1327
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,160
blow out my Birthday candles.

1328
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:15,830
- But what about the brat
that sent you the flowers?

1329
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:17,553
- My dad, what about him?

1330
01:15:27,327 --> 01:15:30,410
(light bouncy music)

1331
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:40,645
- Well did you get anything?

1332
01:15:40,645 --> 01:15:43,887
- I got a tip and a phone number.

1333
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:45,633
- I mean did you see anything?

1334
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:52,679
(car engine rumbling)

1335
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,820
That map on the wall, that's the same one

1336
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,800
JR had isn't it?

1337
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,350
- Yeah, I think it is.

1338
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,840
- [Male] They aren't dead.

1339
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,020
- [Male] That happens sometimes.

1340
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,346
- And there's that limper.

1341
01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:09,309
Who's this other guy?

1342
01:16:09,309 --> 01:16:10,890
- [Male] You're supposed to be the best.

1343
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,550
- [Male] I am.

1344
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:13,570
- [Male] You're wasting my time.

1345
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,080
- [Male] I'm paying for your time.

1346
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,960
- No way, turn around (gasps),

1347
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:24,915
Nigel it's Jean Philippe Andrews.

1348
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,463
I can't believe you two can
eat at a time like this.

1349
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:34,215
- This is lunch, this
is not a time like this,

1350
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,048
whatever that means.

1351
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:37,010
- What it means is we
know who's doing what,

1352
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:40,420
we know why, we have a
victim, we have a videotape.

1353
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,310
- And as I said before, we
can't prove anything, not yet.

1354
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,920
- There must be something we can do.

1355
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,990
- We can question the shooter,

1356
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:50,330
but if he's a pro he won't crack,

1357
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,440
and besides he's just a hired gun.

1358
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,040
- Why don't we go after Andrews?

1359
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,860
- What's his motive, he owns Tassajaro,

1360
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,337
he can do anything on
that land he wants to do

1361
01:16:59,337 --> 01:17:02,513
that's not illegal,
including drilling for oil.

1362
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,930
- Why have JR killed, it makes no sense.

1363
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:08,763
The worse thing he could have done

1364
01:17:08,763 --> 01:17:10,433
is write an embarrassing expose.

1365
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:14,110
- The Andrews name means a lot round here,

1366
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:19,003
maybe Jean Philippe just felt
he couldn't afford an expose.

1367
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,363
What can I say, people are weird.

1368
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:25,930
- Now we're missing something,

1369
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:28,283
there's a piece of the
puzzle we haven't found.

1370
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,300
- You haven't said a word, not one.

1371
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,530
I hate it when you're not talking,

1372
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:39,710
it means you're thinking,
which is never good

1373
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,470
because if you don't
figure out whatever it is

1374
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:42,970
you're trying to figure out then you just

1375
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:45,554
start obsessing and festering you know,

1376
01:17:45,554 --> 01:17:48,230
and then the pressure, it
just builds and builds,

1377
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:52,040
and builds and builds and
then kaboom, you know.

1378
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,110
You're like Mount Vesuvius erupting

1379
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:56,482
and then blowing hot ash
and rock miles into the air

1380
01:17:56,482 --> 01:17:58,620
and burying thousands of innocent people

1381
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,150
in your molten lava, like me for instance.

1382
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,827
- Nigel, if you keep distracting me

1383
01:18:02,827 --> 01:18:04,673
I'm going to sew your lips together.

1384
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:08,660
- It could be 100 million
dollars, this isn't about money.

1385
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,783
Jean Philippe has broken
his families sacred oath.

1386
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,863
Start calling, the ceremonies tomorrow.

1387
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,350
- What's wrong, what's
Jean Philippe doing?

1388
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:21,910
- His office sent this
letter out to all the elders,

1389
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,343
he's selling Tassajaro.

1390
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:26,375
- To JDT.

1391
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,400
- But he is JDT, that
doesn't make any sense.

1392
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,130
- Why sell it, he should
give that land to us,

1393
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,373
that's what Bart had
always intended to do.

1394
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,610
- Until he found Jean
Philippe, his only heir.

1395
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,363
The missing piece Nigel.

1396
01:18:47,752 --> 01:18:51,100
(phone dialing)

1397
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:56,100
Francoise, it's Prudence, that
document that I faxed to you,

1398
01:18:57,349 --> 01:18:59,747
I need to know what it says right now.

1399
01:19:01,857 --> 01:19:05,070
- Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming.

1400
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:07,660
I'm Jean Philippe Andrews,
I've invited you here today

1401
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,610
to remember my father Harvey Andrews,

1402
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:12,893
and to celebrate the future of Tassajaro,

1403
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:15,950
a future that my father and generations

1404
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:18,310
of the Andrews family would embrace.

1405
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:21,790
Over the past 160 years,
the Andrews family has

1406
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,959
protected and preserved Tassajaro --

1407
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:28,959
(Jean Philippe continues
speaking in the distance)

1408
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:33,863
- I'll be right there.

1409
01:19:41,592 --> 01:19:44,675
(knocking on window)

1410
01:19:45,723 --> 01:19:48,020
- Yeah, I'll call you back.

1411
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,080
Well well, what a pleasant surprise.

1412
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,739
- Oh I'm sure it's a surprise
but it won't be pleasant.

1413
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:54,410
- Why what's happened?

1414
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,480
- Bart Andrews son died in the same crash

1415
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,250
that killed his mother.

1416
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,420
- What are you talking about?

1417
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,671
- Of course you learnt about this

1418
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,490
when you heard about Jean Vieve,

1419
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,750
but you didn't tell Bart
that when he sent you

1420
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,710
to try and find his son, did you?

1421
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:07,960
- That's ridiculous.

1422
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,768
- Is it, Bart was dying,

1423
01:20:10,768 --> 01:20:11,810
and you weren't a member of the family,

1424
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:13,527
so you weren't going to get a penny.

1425
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:16,540
So you found a boy the same
age as Jean Philippe in France,

1426
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:19,220
you made a deal with him, and
you created a son for Bart

1427
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,918
that would be your key
to the family fortune.

1428
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,600
- You know what this is
Prudence, it's a sick fantasy.

1429
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,970
You need professional help.

1430
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,630
- Actually you're the one that needs help,

1431
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:31,023
a good defense lawyer,
and it's not a fantasy.

1432
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:34,853
It's the real thing.

1433
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,018
- How much do you want for it?

1434
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:42,553
- Er, how does a billion dollars sound?

1435
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,160
- Something tells me they're not gonna

1436
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,123
accept that offer Prudence.

1437
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:52,270
- Don't be stupid Doug, you really think

1438
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:54,320
we didn't tell the police
everything we know.

1439
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,290
- Oh, I know you didn't,

1440
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,443
otherwise they'd be
here instead of you two.

1441
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:00,395
- Freeze, drop the gun.

1442
01:21:02,423 --> 01:21:03,473
Don't think, drop it.

1443
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,870
Hands behind your head, both of yah.

1444
01:21:09,633 --> 01:21:10,763
Drop to your knees.

1445
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:15,830
Cross your ankles.

1446
01:21:16,726 --> 01:21:18,586
(police siren wailing)

1447
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:20,030
- On behalf of the Andrews family

1448
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,930
I'm pleased to announce
that every penny of this

1449
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:23,780
five million dollars will be donated

1450
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,500
to the Native American Tribal Council.

1451
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,440
- We don't want money, you
won't destroy our history

1452
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,290
and heritage.

1453
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:31,710
- I assure you we're
not destroying anything.

1454
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,740
We're transferring
stewardship to a company

1455
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,450
that will continue the
tradition of my family.

1456
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:38,450
- You said your family.

1457
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:40,030
- Yes, we've owned this land since 140 --

1458
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,482
- No the Andrews have owned this land,

1459
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,649
and you're not a member of that family,

1460
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:48,820
you're a pretender, a liar and a fraud.

1461
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,160
Not only that he's
planning to drill for oil

1462
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,913
under Tassajaro, and
desecrate this sacred ground.

1463
01:21:54,913 --> 01:21:55,746
- What do you think you're doing?

1464
01:21:55,746 --> 01:21:57,430
- Yanking your cover.

1465
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:59,630
- Can we have security
up here please right now.

1466
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:01,973
- It's not necessary the
police are already here.

1467
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:08,100
This is a French death certificate,

1468
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,900
that's proof that Bart Andrews
son died three years ago

1469
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:15,900
in Paris, whoever he is,
he's not Bart's heir.

1470
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,570
He doesn't own Tassajaro,
and he's not selling anything

1471
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,403
but a lie.

1472
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:26,646
(crowd cheers and applauds)

1473
01:22:30,435 --> 01:22:33,518
(light bright music)

1474
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:39,400
Jeffery it's Prudence.

1475
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,850
- [Jeffrey] How was your vacation?

1476
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:42,403
- Perfect, just what I needed.

1477
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:45,460
But that's not why I'm calling.

1478
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,323
- [Jeffrey] Is anything wrong?

1479
01:22:47,323 --> 01:22:49,363
Please don't tell me you've been arrested.

1480
01:22:49,363 --> 01:22:51,660
- Who was my mothers lover?

1481
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,590
- [Jeffrey] Oh you've read the letters.

1482
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,830
- You knew about those.

1483
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,820
- I've known about them for years,

1484
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,927
I asked Ruth to give them to you.

1485
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:00,050
- Why?

1486
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,610
- I wanted you to know how
much someone loved her,

1487
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,210
and how much she loved him back.

1488
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:09,090
- My God, Jeffrey you and my mother.

1489
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,283
- Were dear friends for 30 years,

1490
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,440
lovers after your father died.

1491
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,810
- Well why are you telling me this now?

1492
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:19,670
- Because I think you need
to know about this now.

1493
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,970
- About you and my mother.

1494
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:24,800
- No, about your mother,
she waited too long

1495
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,170
to start living the life that she wanted.

1496
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:29,433
I know she wouldn't want you
to make the same mistake.

1497
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:36,030
- Um, I've got to go, when
I get back to New York,

1498
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:37,480
we've got to talk.

1499
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,491
- Of course.

1500
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:41,574
(motorcycle roaring)

1501
01:23:53,773 --> 01:23:55,993
- Cool motorcycle, thanks for the ride.

1502
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,610
- Take a cab next time,
hitch hiking is dangerous.

1503
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:03,523
- I know, I just wanted to
get here, like really quickly.

1504
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,790
Is Nigel here?

1505
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:08,670
- He's been up since dawn getting ready.

1506
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,870
- Oh he has not.

1507
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,680
- Oh yes he has, trust me.

1508
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,350
- (laughs) Oh my God, he's so adorable.

1509
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,420
- Well whatever threads
your needle sweetie,

1510
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,760
he's in the house, you'll probably have to

1511
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,110
scrape him off the ceiling.

1512
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:21,513
- Ooh, yummy.

1513
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,784
- I'm glad you called, surprised but glad.

1514
01:24:30,784 --> 01:24:32,090
- Me too.

1515
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:33,780
- Surprised or glad?

1516
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,051
- Both.

1517
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:36,939
- You sure you're ready for this?

1518
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:39,533
- Well I'm not sure but I am ready.

1519
01:24:43,936 --> 01:24:45,300
- Your first time right?

1520
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,133
- My first time, be gentle.

1521
01:24:48,133 --> 01:24:50,183
- It's my middle name, hold on.

1522
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:53,583
- To what, where are the handles?

1523
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:55,083
- I'm the handles.

1524
01:24:58,587 --> 01:24:59,420
Tighter.

1525
01:25:02,376 --> 01:25:05,315
(motorcycle engine roaring)

1526
01:25:05,315 --> 01:25:08,648
(bright cheerful music)

1527
01:26:19,399 --> 01:26:22,649
(electronic whooshing)
