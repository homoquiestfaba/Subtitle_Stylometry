00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,649
Williamsburg Savings Bank

2
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,149
good morning sir,
Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,241
Let me give you a call,

4
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,777
We will arrange an interview for you
With a bank employee.

5
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,331
Once someone is available.

6
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,085
What will this device do?

7
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,956
It will shine and shake.

8
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,503
The red lights will turn in a circle.
You can not miss it.

9
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,291
Where do I wait?

10
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,173
In the guest lounge.

11
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,732
Williamsburg Savings Bank.

12
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,190
We are ready to meet you now.

13
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,871
I see overdrafts
On your current account.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,540
It seems that no deposits have been made.

15
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,039
A few months ago.

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,130
"Waxler" for mining.

17
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,047
Yes, I have been phoning them for weeks.

18
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,716
I did not get a satisfactory answer.

19
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,811
What about this foreclosure warning?

20
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,352
Yellow warning.
You must have defaulted.

21
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,728
My real estate mortgage tripled.
Between overnight.

22
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:33,072
I got a short promotion With a reduced
interest rate ended in January.

23
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,237
That's why they call it "short."

24
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,695
Right?
Because it does not last, is that logical?

25
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,736
The new interest rate is much higher,

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,370
So monthly payments jumped
To suddenly mortgage you.

27
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,829
We must clarify the possibility of
this happening When refinancing.

28
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,252
- You did it.
- I did what?

29
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,051
You sold me this nonsense.

30
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,384
"Joe Harding".

31
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,262
No. I know the name.

32
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,768
To review my remarks here only.

33
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,735
Terms and conditions are explained.

34
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,941
I personally explained.

35
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,726
The possibility of higher interest rates
During refinancing.

36
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,611
Do you remember that?

37
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,858
You told me.

38
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,699
The odds of exceeding the interest rate
For the basic financing price.

39
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,577
Very slim.

40
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,243
But it is possible.

41
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,872
But you have confirmed
that it is "very small".

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,090
- But I did not hide it "possible."
- Listen, "Chuck".

43
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,883
My granddaughter and daughter live with me.

44
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,877
My daughter is a nurse with low wages.

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,600
She wanted her daughter to go to a
better school, So dwell with me.

46
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,562
- Many do.
- Yes, as you see,

47
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,434
I can not lose my house.

48
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,641
Do not worry.

49
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,561
It is only yellow warning.

50
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,770
The red alert is the most dangerous.

51
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,109
Can I talk to someone else?

52
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,317
- With whom?
- With someone smarter?

53
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,204
Ladies and gentlemen, Thank
you for your attention.

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,908
We came for a withdrawal.

55
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,337
Excluding cashiers,

56
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,345
We would like to lie down on your back,

57
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,008
And lift up your arms and your feet
In the air like cats.

58
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,642
Let everyone land!

59
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,846
Camera 5.

60
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,365
Dear tellers,

61
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,693
Please do not act foolishly
They call the silent alarm.

62
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,649
Police men
They are the last to attend.

63
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,429
The situation will be messy, right?

64
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,699
Raise your hands.

65
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,498
Why is that?
My God, why here? What did you do?

66
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,618
You!

67
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,669
I follow the rules,
Follow the procedure only.

68
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,869
Just stay calm, stay calm.

69
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,709
- Follow the procedures.
- Hey!

70
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,294
You will be shot!

71
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,459
Dear Sir,
It is worth your while to remain silent.

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,839
I suffer from muscle spasm.

73
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,875
Please relax, you can sit down.

74
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,402
No! Not you!
In the position of the cat!

75
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,639
And keep putting money, come on.

76
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,815
You can take this.

77
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:16,692
I am sorry that you are the victim of a
corrupt regime No longer serve people.

78
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,235
Yes, I was saving my money
here 40 years ago. Games.

79
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,856
They only care about your account number.

80
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,202
There is not much in it,
but it's all yours.

81
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,486
No my friend, not you.

82
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,254
It is the duty of society
to care for the elderly.

83
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,708
This "Chuck" never cared.

84
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,252
"Chuck".

85
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,674
- Are you "Chuck"?
- Yes.

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,880
I "Chuck", I "Chuck".

87
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,510
Are you the one who will
take this man's house?

88
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,398
- No, not personally.
- Give me your wallet.

89
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,103
Well, I have... I have...

90
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,105
I have many cards here, we agreed?
Liquid money.

91
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,558
Membership is available in a gym.
Take it, I never go.

92
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,768
15 seconds.

93
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,189
Cutting position!

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,436
Shut up!

95
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,618
I am happy to say that our meeting is over.

96
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,704
Please do not tell the
police for ninety seconds.

97
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,961
The shooting does not end
Never happy ending.

98
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,969
They make pills to solve it.

99
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,479
"Go style."

100
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,495
This tattoo looks like a ring to me.

101
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,988
The details are many.

102
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,407
I think the artist of all
colors painted them.

103
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,406
If the shop found a snag,

104
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,789
You'll find the artist,
You will find a bank thief.

105
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,628
It seems to me a simple matter.

106
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,303
True, I thank you very much, old man.

107
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,922
We'll get you a job in the police.

108
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,530
Listen, I watch a television series.

109
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:10,137
Called "Lo and Order"
They solve crimes faster than you.

110
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,765
You should see it.

111
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,137
In the real world,

112
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,270
It takes longer to solve crimes
From an hour-long series.

113
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,689
I think that's all, Mr. Harding.

114
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,490
If we protest any additional information,
We'll call you.

115
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,625
I'll give you my address and phone number.

116
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,032
This is not necessary.

117
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,328
We will find you, this is our specialty.

118
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,460
So how did they look?

119
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,335
Their features are difficult to define.
They were hooded.

120
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,172
I approached one of them,
He was a 180 cm tall man.

121
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,048
He had a tattoo around his neck

122
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,796
I told you about it.

123
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,178
If they find the artist of shame.

124
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,065
- They will find the offender.
- Absolutely.

125
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,222
That's what I told them.

126
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,790
Well, I'm sure he is not supposed to
Talk about these things.

127
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,557
You must be present during a burglary
It was great.

128
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,560
Crime is not wonderful, my love.

129
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,529
He could have been shot.

130
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,902
Or worse.

131
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,899
What is worse than being shot?

132
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,741
Exposure to two rounds of fire.

133
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,252
These details traditionally indicate
To belong to a criminal gang.

134
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,923
We believe these individuals have been used
The artist himself.

135
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,543
If we find this artist, we
will find the criminal.

136
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,550
Bank robbery in Brooklyn -
Client "Heimer", FBI.

137
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:24,747
It's really simple.

138
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,422
- Hey, that's what we said.
- Are there other questions?

139
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,844
What a creep.

140
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,392
Pay attention to your words.

141
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,681
If you have any information
About the artist of shame.

142
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,846
Police draw for tattoo

143
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,353
I hit it!

144
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,440
"The three men left
With about $ 1.6 million."

145
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,528
Three hooded robbers steal 1.6 million.

146
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,072
"FBI and police 'New York'."

147
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,156
"They say they have no evidence right now."

148
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,322
and what?

149
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,623
No one is hurt only the insurance company,
They will be fine.

150
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,705
They were very quiet gentlemen.

151
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,620
They carried out the
operation very carefully.

152
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,960
Like a dance.

153
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,685
Yes, the "Kunga" dance is immediately
immersed in them In prison.

154
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,053
Will we play or what?

155
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,130
Ask the responsible man.

156
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,049
Milton?

157
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,591
Milton!

158
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,801
Who will play in the second arena?

159
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,102
Yeah.

160
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,149
"J52".

161
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,231
If my condition is as bad as it is,
They fired at me.

162
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,738
Did you receive one of these messages?

163
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,906
Department of Retirement.

164
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,274
She came in a registered mail.

165
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,454
Yes sir.

166
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,948
Have you ever received good news?
Need your signature?

167
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,911
Have you contacted anyone in the factory?

168
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,501
Not yet, but we'll
discover what's going on.

169
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,088
I need pension money.

170
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,093
Yes, we are all this man.

171
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,345
I have something very important to say.

172
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,796
"J52".

173
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,099
Let's go and help the old.

174
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,186
"Easy Rollers."

175
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,481
When we agreed to merge,

176
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,646
Simtek did not have the intention
To close factories in "America".

177
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,365
But with demand falling
On specialized pieces,

178
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,372
And the increasing cost of
production in this country,

179
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,164
They made a decision.

180
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,712
Transfer all manufacturing
operations to Vietnam.

181
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,885
Wixler Mining Company.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,720
Operations of "Waxler" in "America".

183
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,223
Stops in stages within 30 days.

184
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,215
30 days? Are you kidding?

185
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,888
Hey guys, I understand it's tough news.

186
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,558
I can not address you
Unless you are calm.

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,400
Excuse me, Mr. Lewis.

188
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,895
Welcome Joe.

189
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,237
What does this mean?

190
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,742
What will happen to our pension?

191
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,655
"Simtech" for mining has been frozen.

192
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,075
All pension payments
During the transitional period.

193
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,005
What does that mean? Frozen?

194
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,752
Wixler kept a box.

195
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,709
To meet the retirement plans concluded
Prior to merger,

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,590
Which would eventually unite
With the new pension fund.

197
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,758
Under the new employment contract.

198
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,177
Heaven forbid, can you speak clearly?

199
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,345
With the cessation of US operations, There is no
longer any financial responsibility for SIMTEC.

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,360
The retirement fund will be dissolved.

201
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,450
With all my respect, "Donald"

202
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:44,446
30 years of hard work
Does not mean anything to you!

203
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,747
Restaurant "Nat".

204
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,877
Without retirement money, I will not
even be able to pay this month's rent.

205
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,712
We will appoint and sue a lawyer
For many money.

206
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,052
Damn, we'll be dead
Before we get the settlement money.

207
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,047
This fits them perfectly.

208
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,096
When did the price of
coffee become two dollars?

209
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,643
A decade ago.

210
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,636
If you request additional cream,
You will pay another amount.

211
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,731
Let's blow it by 20 percent.

212
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,815
She can now do a cruise.

213
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,321
Hey guys, I have half a fruit pie.

214
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,403
We have crispy cherry fritters,
But it is a bit old.

215
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,320
I have a pie with chocolate mousse,
What do you bring?

216
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,663
Not today, thank you.

217
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,825
You will not eat a pie?

218
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,663
We maintain our weights.

219
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,078
We are also bankrupt.

220
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,327
Well, do not book the table all day.

221
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,959
I have to earn my living here.

222
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,509
Did I tell you that those who took
over the bank They were carrying guns?

223
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,593
She told us six times already!

224
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,139
Yes, the details of the
incident do not leave my head.

225
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,303
I remember them over and over, do you know?

226
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,142
She may have a stroke.

227
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,020
Please guys, Always eat a pie.

228
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,936
Life is short.

229
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,944
Thanks for the ticket.

230
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,191
It's right.

231
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,319
We must take our share of the pie
And we eat it.

232
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,607
We have at least achieved this.

233
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,698
Good evening, sir. Good evening.

234
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,041
Welcome to the last concert
to present the rose.

235
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,053
Kaitlin, this is the
last rose of the night.

236
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,172
You count your genius!

237
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,380
My heart is beating hard in my chest now.

238
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:24,301
This week was... amazing.

239
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,911
"Sean" boring, and "Nick" punk man
Multi-Sexual Relationships.

240
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,563
Sincerity in relationships
Obsolete.

241
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,517
I am fond of this and very sexy.

242
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,030
"Ben", it's her only choice.

243
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,073
You will not move to a farm
With this high heel shoe.

244
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,697
I accepted them all, and used her tongue.

245
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,705
I did it with all the crew,
It's a mobile sex infection!

246
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,159
This week and the events that have passed.

247
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,829
Makes my decision seem impossible.

248
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,919
"Kaitlin," I shut your mouth.

249
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,092
"Nick".

250
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,180
- Haha!
- My God!

251
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,925
Shut it up, that's ridiculous.

252
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,929
They never learn.

253
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,690
I'll go home to arrange my drug.

254
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,944
I see you tomorrow.

255
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,612
It was a fantastic meal tonight.

256
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,114
It is impressive
What you can do with frozen fish.

257
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,705
The best garlic bread I've ever eaten.

258
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,743
And the mix of red pepper and garlic!

259
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,737
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

260
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,120
In fact, I suspect the reason was mold.

261
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,418
Well, your night is wet.

262
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:34,874
"Joe".

263
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,293
What?

264
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,458
Will we be okay?

265
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,050
Certainly,
Things always end well.

266
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,471
Then one dies.

267
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,636
Thank you for your inspiration, Albert.

268
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,891
Your night is over, I'll see you tomorrow.

269
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,767
- The night of your night, "Joe".
- Your night.

270
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:26,176
Williamsburg Bank -
Stop payment warning.

271
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,176
The villains.

272
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,866
Hi Willie, how do you feel?

273
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,993
I'm not at your best, doctor.
I'm not the best.

274
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,371
Well, I will not lie to you.

275
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,209
You can lie, I do not mind.

276
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,504
Dialysis is no longer feasible.

277
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,048
You will only recover
with total cultivation.

278
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,550
I will look at "Ebay".

279
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,716
You are at the bottom of the list of
beneficiaries, Partly because of your age,

280
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,145
Partly because of your health insurance,
And partly.

281
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,724
Because it is difficult to get kidneys.

282
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,390
Yes, everyone clings to both of them.

283
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,230
Have you spoken to your daughter?
With your friends?

284
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,686
It is common to find a donor
Between your acquaintances.

285
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,227
They are usually available
Best match anyway.

286
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:26,856
I'll talk to them.

287
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,201
Sooner rather than later.

288
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,578
What are we talking about then?

289
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,043
"Fresnos" medical care.

290
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,754
It should be very urgent.

291
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:42,877
Hello?

292
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,376
Have you got your gift, Grandpa?

293
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,546
Have you sent anything?

294
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,724
"Skype."

295
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:47,882
Wait a little,

296
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,840
The courier brought me this box,

297
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,302
But it is inconceivable that it is a gift.

298
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,470
She is, she is!

299
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,469
Well, okay, relax, I'm an old man.

300
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,149
Oh my God.

301
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,903
This is the ugliest shirt I have ever seen.

302
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,069
Grand.

303
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,952
Well, let's also see what's here.

304
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,749
You grow up quickly, "Kay".

305
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,355
It grew two and a half centimeters
In a month, my grandfather.

306
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,553
Tell your mother.

307
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,093
That her career
It is not important to see her family.

308
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,638
I will.

309
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,603
- Are you mining me?
- I promise you.

310
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,183
A obedient girl.

311
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,483
- I got my car.
- Okay.

312
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,307
Disconnection.

313
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,086
Oh my God.

314
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,848
"Ezra"!

315
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,766
"Ezra"!

316
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,483
Must stop,
I can no longer listen.

317
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,726
I was working!

318
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,728
But that does not matter,
Your playing gets worse every week.

319
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,400
It is a miracle,
I do not know how to do this.

320
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,110
What is the feasibility?
I'm not smart, I do not like playing,

321
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,679
You will not become a professional.

322
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,897
I would like to end your case
Factor in a plant like me?

323
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,663
Each bimonthly party is held
For $ 40 in a bar?

324
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,827
Do not want it.

325
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,255
So I do not like this machine.

326
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,213
No, she does not love you either.

327
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,843
Trust me, I offer you service,
You will thank me for this.

328
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,132
Thanks sir.

329
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,595
Welcome and capacity.

330
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,965
I want to be a dancer, like Beyonce.

331
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,553
Well, that's none of my business.

332
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,009
Well, that's good.

333
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,640
Well, stay away from me.

334
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,307
Stay away, I'll look for your grandmother.

335
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,187
It still has to pay for the meeting.

336
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,575
Think about it
Like killing a sick horse.

337
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,985
Sometimes it is thinner
The most moral work you can do.

338
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,445
Well, thank you for your patience with me.

339
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,947
I really appreciate your honesty.

340
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,909
Your grandson does not
have any musical talent.

341
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:28,001
I know, listening to him was painful
From the other room.

342
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,458
I had to sit in front of him.

343
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,299
Well.

344
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,554
- "Al".
- What?

345
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:37,135
I never told you this,
But I saw you play a few times.

346
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,507
At West Village.

347
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,140
With Stan Goetz, 1977.

348
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,097
It was amazing.

349
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,268
You saw me play with "Getz"?
Three hundred fifty.

350
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,435
Certainly.

351
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,773
What? Did you follow me?

352
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,398
No, I was following music.

353
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,487
I'll see you in the store, we agreed?

354
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,066
See you at the store.

355
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,239
Yes.

356
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,078
Well.

357
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,704
See you tomorrow!

358
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,162
Goodbye guys.

359
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,881
You know what? At some point,

360
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,878
I would have to go home alone.

361
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,379
I am 14 years old.

362
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,433
I'm not there, love.

363
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,395
The neighborhood no longer
existed 40 years ago.

364
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:26,136
True, it has become safer
and more sophisticated.

365
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,556
Look

366
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,149
and what is that?

367
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,274
It is a test of biology.

368
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,733
Another day, another excellent estimate.

369
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,534
Well done, my little one.

370
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,896
I almost realized the meaning.

371
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:39,989
What do you mean?

372
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,907
You told me, I quote from your words,

373
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,696
"If you excel in all materials,
You'll get a puppy."

374
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,909
I like your confidence.

375
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,131
I must have inherited
it from you young man.

376
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,802
Not bad my pet, Not bad at all.

377
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,509
"Knights of Hudson"
Buffet for $ 4 on Thursdays.

378
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,599
Happy birthday, young man.

379
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,769
I did not expect you to buy
me a present, you bastard.

380
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,534
Lighten your enthusiasm.
Not expensive.

381
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,782
This is exactly what you need.

382
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:22,989
Yes.

383
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,528
One does not get enough time.

384
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,658
Look at that nice picture.

385
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,582
Yes, my pet is "Kay".

386
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,038
When you die,
You can pass it on as a memory.

387
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,344
Thank you, "Al".

388
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,783
I trust she will not want a
picture of herself On an hour.

389
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,301
Of her dead grandfather.

390
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,393
Look at her, she's really special.

391
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,763
Sure, boy.

392
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,682
This atom looks like World War II.

393
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,769
Corn?

394
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,852
I thought it...

395
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,149
I do not know what I thought.

396
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,421
I think I would like to steal a bank.

397
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,015
What did you say?

398
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,297
I'm thinking of robbing a bank.

399
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,722
I'm thinking of buying a Ferrari.

400
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,160
They chose me to play with the Knicks team,
A good week for all?

401
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,402
A good week.

402
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,192
They will take my house.

403
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,240
They will take my house.

404
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,702
30 days ahead.

405
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,152
Who will take your home?

406
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,362
A bank.

407
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,951
They will take your house and not tell us?

408
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,026
What will you do? You lend me money?

409
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,292
We are all bankrupt,
The three of us are together.

410
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:55,755
Those banks have practically
destroyed this country.

411
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:59,048
The dreams of many have been crushed.

412
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:02,423
And it does not hurt them at all.

413
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:06,051
We are three elderly men,
If we are bankrupt and bankrupt,

414
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,720
We will retire with dignity.

415
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,850
At worst, they will catch us,

416
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,437
And we get a bed
And three meals a day.

417
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,653
And health care
Better than that we have now.

418
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:22,145
Are you talking about us?

419
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,035
You and you?

420
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:27,446
Yes, if a band of thieves succeed,
It is not very difficult.

421
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,776
I lost your mind.

422
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:33,661
I spent 20 years
Waiting for death, "Al".

423
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,250
Without a life or a goal.

424
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,376
Will bank robbery give me a goal?

425
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,254
I will give you money.

426
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,340
Willy will be able to ride a plane
And seeing his granddaughter.

427
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,757
It's hard to catch up with airplanes
From prison, "Joe".

428
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,966
Yes, but we will not be caught.

429
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,636
They were not arrested.

430
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,565
Well, they were young.
They were fast.

431
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,394
We have skills, experience,
and intelligence.

432
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:58,231
Arthritis and gout
And neuropathy.

433
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,290
Wish you wish "Willie".

434
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,730
Happy birthday, "Willie".

435
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,161
Hello?

436
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,957
Just lie here,

437
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:01,582
I think of all the wishes of my birthday
Over the years.

438
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,381
And how many of them remained secret.

439
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,966
None of them has been realized.

440
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,509
It does not seem to ever materialize.

441
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,605
So risk me
To tell you this is my "Joe".

442
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,103
I mean, what's the worst that might happen?

443
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,515
Nothing at all, right?

444
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,523
You do not have what, "Willy."

445
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:24,733
I want to live better than I do now.

446
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,280
I want to see my family
more than once a year.

447
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,736
From now on,

448
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,740
I want to eat a pie whenever I want.

449
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,121
Do you understand what I mean?

450
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,370
I agree with you heart and soul.

451
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,956
I was serious today.

452
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,798
I think so.

453
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,421
Actually,

454
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,051
We have nothing to lose.

455
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,354
I'm not a thief, Joe.

456
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,144
Neither do I.

457
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,561
We will take exactly what they owe us
From the retirement account, right?

458
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,018
That's all I want.

459
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,228
And no penny increase.

460
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,608
I pledge that.

461
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,820
Awakened "Al".

462
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,743
Slow down.

463
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,570
"Al".

464
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,368
"Al".

465
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,284
"Albert"!

466
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:17,737
Lift the headset!

467
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:18,911
Who died?

468
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,539
No one, it's "Joe".

469
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,116
I do not talk to criminals.

470
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:24,917
Did you hear that?

471
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,085
I close the line, I'll call back.

472
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,677
What do you want?

473
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:36,846
But what do you want, "Al"?

474
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:41,394
I want to withdraw quietly,
Or are you walking in a noisy way?

475
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,850
I have no problem with death.

476
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,660
But I do not want to die while in prison.

477
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,980
No one will enter the prison.

478
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,898
What is going on here exactly?

479
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,276
What is going on here exactly?

480
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,823
Both lost his mind.

481
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,066
Think about it, "Al".

482
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,697
I do not want to think about anything,
I am not a bank robber.

483
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,125
Neither are you, nor are you, "Willie."

484
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,079
What?

485
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,497
Why did you answer the phone?

486
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,955
Because he was ringing.

487
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,455
Because you're interested.

488
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,087
Have you become my psychiatrist now?

489
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,493
But closer to a fortune-teller.

490
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,668
So I know I'll end the call now.

491
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
I'll see you tomorrow, "Al."

492
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,383
Happy dreams.

493
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,301
Do not call back.

494
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:45,328
Well Hey "Willie",
To master the basics first.

495
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,424
Expiration dates are written
In a tiny line.

496
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,297
Take this, I bought two at a price.

497
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,085
Good chicken thighs
Discounted rates.

498
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,679
I can prepare Cordon Bleu.

499
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,004
The Mets team or the Yankees?

500
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,765
Do not congratulate.

501
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,307
New York...

502
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,809
Two beautiful hats.

503
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,100
We have a business here, "Al."

504
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,271
Well, what do you mean?

505
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:10,648
Give me that menu.

506
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,146
What are you doing?

507
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,987
Wait here, we'll be right back.

508
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,952
What do you do with my list?

509
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,783
Why did you rip my list?

510
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,528
Why should I wait in the car?

511
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,950
Wait in the damn car!

512
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,539
Why?

513
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,689
I do not want to stay in the car,
The atmosphere is hot here!

514
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:52,726
"Joe", "Joe"!
Behind the bread cut cans.

515
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,988
"Joe", I'll get barbecue.

516
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,663
We need chicken,
We will prepare the Cordon Bleu.

517
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,322
I do not want Cordon Bleu.

518
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,830
Stick to the plan!

519
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,866
Welcome to Valeo.

520
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Hello, "Al".

521
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,208
Hi Annie.

522
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,575
What do you want to buy?

523
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,672
It was planned
Preparation of "Cordon Bleu" chicken,

524
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,880
But the plan seems to be changing.

525
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,434
I have to bring some chicken thighs.

526
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,096
Let me help you.

527
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,518
"Gold Middle"
Accurate and versatile.

528
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,079
Service table BBQ meat.

529
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,541
Give me the big piece.

530
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,541
The whole piece?

531
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,705
The whole piece.

532
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,802
You have what you want.

533
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,725
"Annie," let me carry the basket.

534
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,716
Barbak, you have your own business now.

535
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:08,058
No, no, this is my work, no problem.

536
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,233
There is a voucher
Multiplied by the ad.

537
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,405
The price is like thighs, but as you see,

538
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,484
These are chicken breasts.

539
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:18,899
The breasts are better than the thighs,
do not you think so?

540
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,991
I do not mind either.

541
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,236
Pork.

542
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,121
It looks delicious.

543
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:31,368
Do you like pork?

544
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,597
Well.

545
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,182
This will fit perfectly with.

546
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:51,268
This is a big bottle.

547
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,065
Yes, listen, I must tell you this.

548
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,728
You are a wonderful woman,
But I know what you are doing.

549
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,978
You are wasting your time,
I do not want a relationship with anyone.

550
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,191
I did not offer you a relationship.

551
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,490
Well, great, so we agree.

552
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,374
Security to foreign foods
department please.

553
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,123
We will discuss this later.

554
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,038
I look forward to it.

555
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,385
Where is my basket in hell?

556
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:03,839
"Willie", "Willie".

557
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,341
Al disappeared.

558
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:06,972
I have a new escape car.

559
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,595
Where did you come from?

560
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:09,762
Stolen.

561
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,060
Skip in Cart.

562
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,933
Who do you think? "ET"?

563
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,540
"Willie", jump in the damned basket.

564
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,143
I will not ride in the basket!

565
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,317
They follow us.

566
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,950
You, stop your place!

567
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,244
Hey! Stop!

568
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:34,251
- Stop!
- Why do you haunt me?

569
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:35,496
Stop!

570
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,124
I first heard you.

571
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,881
Do not force me to be dumbfounded!

572
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:42,669
This is not a confession of guilt!
I'm just tired.

573
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,378
We must get rid of some weight.

574
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:46,088
Get rid of the damn pork pudding.

575
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,258
What?

576
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,218
What?

577
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,217
Flour, Flour.

578
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:55,308
Stop!

579
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,060
Stop!

580
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Stop!

581
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,046
I think we can get ahead of the signal.

582
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,277
No, the signal will not precede you, Joe.

583
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,089
No, the signal will not precede you, Joe.

584
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,284
Hey!

585
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,662
No, "Joe",
Can not precede the signal!

586
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,498
Appreciate that the signal precedes!
We will do it!

587
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,463
- Will not precede the signal!
- Yes, we will!

588
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,416
Do not take another step.

589
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:37,426
I no longer know what is
happening in the world.

590
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,517
You will prepare "Cordon Bleu"
Chicken thighs?

591
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,439
This is a crime in itself.

592
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:47,068
I have nothing to say from my side.

593
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,988
Look what you did with "Cindy".

594
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:54,156
She now looks like a
Colombian drug trafficker.

595
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,881
Never happened

596
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,213
all my life.

597
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:08,008
That someone stole
Full pork pudding.

598
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,720
What was your mother to say?

599
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,090
Perform a major operation or go home.

600
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,009
The thief must have been black.

601
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,607
And why did you do it?
She did not steal anything.

602
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,572
Because your Nazi officer was chasing me.

603
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,074
No, they were clinging to your friend.

604
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,556
He was chasing me,
When someone comes after me, I run away.

605
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,665
Thus do things.

606
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Listen, you are old.

607
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,870
I will become like you after 40
or 50 years, I understand that.

608
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,044
Take it.

609
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,879
These are some coupons.

610
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,545
We will double it on Tuesday,
But I'm sure you already know that.

611
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,046
So, do not steal, this is wrong.

612
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:56,009
If you stole, do not steal
from the Valley Town.

613
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,679
Yes, I have two great friends.

614
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,771
You made me a partner
in the crime of theft.

615
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,686
We did not ask you to do anything.

616
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,695
I brought you here. I'll take you,
so I'm the driver of the escape.

617
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:08,858
Do not give yourself greater than its size.

618
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:11,526
Leading like my grandmother,
She was driving a horse and cart.

619
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:15,525
This is a good joke, so you can go back
Walk home.

620
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,949
Do not touch my car.

621
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,788
You will not force us to walk!

622
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,193
I will certainly challenge you.

623
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,036
Lord, you will be great bank robbers.

624
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,128
They catch you stealing from Valle Town!

625
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,639
I hate him when he is right.

626
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,466
We will need the help of a professional.

627
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:42,725
Do you think so?

628
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,266
Yes, without it
We should turn ourselves in now.

629
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,569
Do you know any criminals?

630
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,404
I know a poor person.

631
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:17,013
- I do not speak English.
- I know that you are, "Murphy".

632
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,763
What are you doing here, Joe?

633
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,930
I came over the expense of
the girl you do not pay.

634
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,310
Did not I get rid of you divorce, "Joe"?

635
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,477
Open the door.

636
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,690
"Strawberry K" - "O Gosh Kush" -
"Bad Beach."

637
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,692
"Maui and Howe".

638
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,651
"Bad Beach".

639
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,451
"Coconut Bleubery".

640
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,495
"Or Josh Kush".

641
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,488
How are these things legal?

642
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,120
Dear Sir, The embargo period is over.

643
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,828
Marijuana has extraordinary
medical benefits.

644
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,129
It is useful in all situations.

645
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:53,843
Anxiety, pain, seizures, and tension.

646
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:58,546
Anxiety, pain, seizures, and tension.

647
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,799
Anxiety, pain, and seizures.

648
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,183
What is your position now?

649
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,268
Currently, anxiety.

650
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:09,274
"Joe," I do not mean to be rude
With family members.

651
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,518
Former family members.

652
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:14,029
As you say, but what do you want from me?

653
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:16,493
We have a project, and we need help.

654
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,450
What kind of projects?

655
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,324
In fact, we prefer not to tell you.

656
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,830
This is difficult for me to help you.

657
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:27,083
We need to find someone
Doing evil deeds.

658
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:30,921
Why do you think I know
Such people?

659
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:32,964
I thought that like you
They mix with the likes of them.

660
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:34,958
Like me? I mean businessmen?

661
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,220
No, but the abject.
Debt evaders.

662
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,513
I trust you can guide us.

663
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,467
To the right path.

664
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:49,727
What did he get?

665
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:50,985
He thinks.

666
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,480
This sounds painful.

667
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,650
I know this,

668
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,567
But I've seen him do it before.

669
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,030
The reason is drugs, you know?

670
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,607
Yes, of course.

671
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,452
"Value Town."

672
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,925
This asshole is a fool.

673
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:18,047
I wish I could shock this old man.

674
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,885
Here is the fruit of the eggplant.

675
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,051
Welcome.

676
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,259
- Hi Annie.
- Hello!

677
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,928
You work here every day,
Do not you have a day off?

678
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,097
No, I work every day.

679
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,905
Rabah, you have a difficult work program.

680
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:31,636
What will you do with this eggplant fruit?

681
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,892
I was thinking about preparing
a stew of vegetables.

682
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:38,901
I love slicing them into thin slices
With parmesan cheese.

683
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,739
They drink all the juices.

684
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,074
Well, this looks good.

685
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,569
You will not taste anything worse.

686
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:45,741
I'm sure of that, listen.

687
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,329
I think you are nice, and I
find you very attractive.

688
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,075
- You think I'm attractive.
- You are very nice.

689
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:52,167
I think that's great.

690
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,832
But you're not looking for
a relationship, right?

691
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,592
This is absolutely true.

692
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,923
This is quite clear, "Al".

693
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,930
Would you like to have
dinner with me someday?

694
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,836
What should I do?
I do not think you hear me!

695
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,352
I hear you very well.

696
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:09,805
Do you know my opinion?

697
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:15,155
I think we owe ourselves
To live every day we have.

698
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,484
I feel I really want
Get to know you more.

699
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,151
I share a meal with you.

700
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,449
What? What's up dear?

701
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:28,948
I have a partner in housing.

702
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,995
I have my own home.

703
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,296
- "Annie".
- What?

704
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:50,145
A wonderful parmesan mining with parmesan.

705
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,307
Thanks.

706
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,485
Of the best quality.

707
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,143
Thanks.

708
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:01,358
Eggs, sausages, fried potatoes,
Roasted bread and coffee please.

709
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:03,697
"Good morning, 'Metzi',
Your hair looks nice today."

710
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,862
"Did you cut your hair?"
"Yes, O 'Al, ' his story."

711
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,156
"Do you know what I want?"
"I do not know 'Al', what?"

712
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,995
"Metzee", you find Babe,
And your smell is amazing.

713
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,661
Now bring me some food,
Because I am starving.

714
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,170
Well, that's better.

715
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,670
I did not think you would join us today.

716
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,342
I am old to carry a grudge.

717
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,144
This has never stopped you from doing so.

718
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,716
Talk to you.

719
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,757
Look! It's a newspaper article!

720
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,258
"The Wixler Fund for
Retirement and its Assets.

721
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:33,603
"Will be distributed to
existing creditors".

722
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:38,396
They use our retirement funds to pay bills.

723
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:41,524
And that's not all, look at this.

724
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,700
"Williamsburg Bank,
Liquidation of funds,

725
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,874
"And restructuring the debts of 'Wixler'".

726
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,123
- It's my bank.
- And my bank also.

727
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,696
And my bank too!

728
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,873
They steal our retirement money!

729
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,460
This is what is written.

730
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,585
I worked for that damned company 40 years,

731
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,272
Now they will steal our pension funds.

732
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:03,906
Take it from here, I'm not hungry.

733
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,377
Would you take him home?
As an external request?

734
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,259
No, no, call it here.

735
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:08,886
I will not allow anyone
Take something from me anymore.

736
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,932
Do you know "Al"?
It's hard to understand today.

737
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,391
I will not go back to your table.

738
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:14,036
Do not leave an ink-stamp with coins.

739
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,431
I'm not a washing machine.

740
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:27,244
I'm OK, I want to steal that bank.

741
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:30,826
It's a good place to hack
it like anywhere else.

742
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,906
Well, how do we start?

743
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,918
Contact the man who deals with him
My previous month.

744
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,752
Why will it help us?

745
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,088
Because it seems.

746
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:47,089
These are the best mariguana
In Brooklyn.

747
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:48,929
Rabah, it's like a pillow.

748
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,552
Yes, but it's a pillow you can smoke.

749
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,350
Dear Sirs, Let us go and
retrieve our money.

750
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,599
I agree with you.

751
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:57,927
Yes!

752
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:00,186
Williamsburg Savings Bank.

753
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,905
"Camio" for pets -
Tropical fish - and birds.

754
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,754
Why should I help you?

755
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:19,082
25 percent, it is not a small amount.

756
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,415
I can steal a bank myself
And reap a hundred percent.

757
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,304
I'm sure of that, but these are easy money.

758
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:28,971
Without any risk, just the bonus.
Let us know and get your pay.

759
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,296
"Murphy" prepares it properly!
This Marijuana is wonderful.

760
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,681
Are you from the police?

761
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,314
We are practically in the eighties of age.

762
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:52,701
I do not know you at all.

763
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:54,995
How do you know "Jesus"
Do you deserve trust?

764
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,278
No, you can trust us.

765
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:03,791
What speeches?

766
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:09,385
What do you think of these men?
What do you think?

767
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,798
What do you think? Tell me.

768
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,297
Are they good or bad?

769
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:14,468
Can I carry it?

770
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:15,886
Do you want to go to it?

771
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,062
He says he does not mind.

772
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,855
He drinks the whole bottle.

773
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,351
A small dog.

774
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,320
I found him in a ditch.

775
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:28,692
- No!
- Yes.

776
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:31,029
People have no pity these days.

777
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:33,415
Why do you think you can succeed?

778
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:37,162
I do not know, we saw that we try.

779
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:41,205
"I do not know, we saw that we try."

780
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:44,331
You may be imprisoned for life,
It is not long for you.

781
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,669
But you should think, old man,
You must know.

782
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,586
This is not like sitting on a bench
in a park He played the Bingo.

783
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:52,506
I hear, he shouted.

784
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:55,684
I am in need of your abuse.

785
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:58,054
The world hurts me enough.

786
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,774
Within 20 days,
There will be no roof for me.

787
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:06,404
Social security check is worthless,
And the pension went into the wind.

788
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:10,362
The three of us will carry out the process.

789
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:13,206
If you want 25 percent for our help,
There is nothing wrong with it.

790
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,277
But if you do not want to.

791
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,574
Keep your hobbies to yourself!

792
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,044
It was a good speech, O owner.

793
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:23,708
Will it help us?

794
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,889
Do you have any snacks?

795
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,055
"Willie"?

796
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:44,774
I like the air blowing in my face.

797
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:45,945
And I too.

798
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:49,943
Oh my God!
Look, we have two novice addicts here.

799
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:53,647
I think I'll get a recipe for her.

800
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,069
And I too.

801
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:06,965
"Knights of Had."

802
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,964
This food is excellent tonight.

803
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,421
They must have changed recipes.

804
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:18,341
It's the same nonsense, but you're too.

805
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,800
Do you mind?

806
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:20,970
Take them both.

807
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:22,308
Well.

808
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:27,187
How much do you have to live, "Willie"?

809
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:31,689
I do not know.

810
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:33,607
He guessed.

811
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,030
Two or three years?

812
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:39,455
That's it? Looks great health!

813
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,032
It's just a feeling, you asked me.

814
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:45,333
What about you?

815
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:49,035
In my opinion, seven years.

816
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,207
What about you, "Al"?

817
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,837
I have a bad luck,
I'll probably live up to 100.

818
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,015
So, you can throw away both of us.

819
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,225
OK.

820
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:02,854
So 27 years in total.

821
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:07,353
Our retirement rate is $ 45,000 per year.

822
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:19,034
We will steal from the bank two million
And 215 thousand dollars.

823
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:22,566
Hey, what if we steal more?

824
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,201
We will donate it to a charity.

825
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,408
Yes, but what if we stole less?
I do not want to steal him twice.

826
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:30,465
"Camio" for pets.

827
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,881
Look, that's our bank there.

828
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,673
Wait a moment, steal your bank?

829
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:35,997
It's a personal matter.

830
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:38,211
Well, we'll skip the first lesson.

831
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,052
What was the first lesson?

832
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,047
Never steal your bank.

833
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:44,219
So we'll move on to the second lesson.

834
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:45,388
20 days

835
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,854
I have 20 days before I lose my house.

836
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,516
Bank robbery is a work of art.

837
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:53,235
Can for ten people
Stealing the place with ten methods.

838
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:58,074
You have to find a plan that suits you.

839
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,422
The cameras are here and here.

840
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:19,839
One entrance.

841
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:21,377
One emergency exit.

842
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,759
Proper car escape is very important.

843
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,775
Find a car that does not raise suspicions.

844
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,180
Car Escape.

845
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:36,411
Learn how to operate a car without a key.

846
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:37,897
Put them together like this.

847
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:40,776
Like magic.

848
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:45,124
16 days.

849
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,577
Improve your fitness.

850
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:49,744
Good.

851
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,593
You must have excellent physical fitness.

852
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,963
Now I realize that you are old.

853
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,575
This is amazing.

854
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,092
But under those masks,

855
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:00,303
You should feel
You are twenty years old.

856
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:01,594
Wait!

857
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:11,098
Absence argument.

858
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,266
This is vital.

859
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:14,234
You must have a strong absence argument.

860
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:15,904
Wednesday the 15th of the month?

861
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:17,733
It's a fundraising night in the shelter.

862
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,478
A strong absence argument.

863
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:21,148
Committee selling shirts.

864
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,398
Do we have volunteers to sell shirts?

865
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,408
Put down your hands please in the back.

866
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:31,834
We are looking for volunteers
for the T-shirts committee.

867
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:34,905
We volunteer, Milton.

868
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,669
10 days.

869
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:40,086
Well.

870
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,733
Each drawer is a cashier
Contains dye packs and tracking devices.

871
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,119
Dye packages and tracking devices.

872
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,434
They will give you one of them if they can,

873
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,806
But they will not endanger anyone's life
To do this.

874
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,443
Get equipment.

875
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:09,197
"Salerno" for surgical equipment.

876
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,829
Wixler Mining Company.

877
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:17,037
Average police response time
Toward an ongoing robbery.

878
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:19,537
Ranging from 2 minutes to 4 minutes,

879
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,630
According to the proximity of the
police unit From the crime scene.

880
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:25,005
And the number of other
policemen at the scene.

881
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,337
Everything is on the Internet.

882
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,430
Set the timing clock to 2 minutes.

883
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:33,925
And practiced as if it
were the actual operation.

884
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,909
4 minutes 54 seconds.

885
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:54,584
Now, you are sitting
In the back of a police car.

886
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:02,127
Your weapons exist only in anticipation
For the worst scenarios.

887
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,964
You must master the shooting,

888
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,590
But the last thing you want
Is to shoot one.

889
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:08,758
Who guards the door?

890
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:11,176
I will, I will guard the door.

891
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,865
Do you know how to deal with a pistol?

892
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,981
Made 300 shirts.

893
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:27,443
Five days.

894
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:28,611
Whenever you enter,

895
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,070
You become better.

896
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:33,449
When the time comes.

897
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:37,538
You will come out of that bank
And with you the amount of money.

898
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,374
You have never seen her.

899
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,246
Very easily.

900
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:47,588
The police might be late.

901
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:55,469
One day.

902
00:50:57,558 --> 00:51:00,098
Attica! Attica! Attica!

903
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,649
Attica! Attica!

904
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,152
I do not want to see the end of the film.

905
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:10,283
Yes, things did not go well.

906
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,026
How can he sleep?

907
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:16,408
He's having sex.

908
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:17,577
True.

909
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,078
I remember that feeling.

910
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:26,169
Are you fine?

911
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,551
Yes, I am at best.

912
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,885
And I too.

913
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:37,138
No one will be hurt.

914
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,101
That's true.

915
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,600
If we are involved in a problem,
We'll get out of there.

916
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,110
That's right, yes.

917
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:47,864
If the police come, we will lie down.

918
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,325
We raise our hands up.

919
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:51,148
Maximum 2 minutes.

920
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,110
Maximum, increase or decrease.

921
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:07,504
Take a nap, young man.

922
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:11,419
Well, you too, young man.

923
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:15,325
Do not let the omelet touch the fruit,
She loves them separately.

924
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:16,737
Do you do this every day?

925
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:18,105
- Every day.
- Do not cheat.

926
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:19,372
Not fooled.

927
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,040
I wish my father had done this to me.

928
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:23,582
And your daughter wishes that too.

929
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:27,295
What are you doing here?

930
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:29,417
It's breakfast for Brock.

931
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:32,425
I see it, but why?

932
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,838
I teach him, he makes an
effort to be a father.

933
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,469
Good morning.

934
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,472
Your father prepared breakfast for you.

935
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,680
O hell!

936
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,270
- On your messenger!
- Pay attention to your words.

937
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:47,695
Sorry.

938
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,650
Your father will take you
out of school today.

939
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,733
Have you become a believer
or something like that?

940
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:58,948
I doubt that, but he realized
what he was missing.

941
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,276
Yes, this week.

942
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,407
He is not good at ending things.

943
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:07,708
I give him a chance, my dear, for my sake.

944
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:11,423
Surely "Joe",
But only because you are my best friend.

945
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:14,747
I love you, my little girl.

946
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:16,922
You will achieve a lot in life.

947
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,885
What is your story today?

948
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,732
Do you have cancer or something like that?

949
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,807
No, I'm as strong as a bull.

950
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:25,973
Well.

951
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,621
It's carnival day, I have many tasks.

952
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,524
Yes, I will come after school.

953
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:33,396
Yes, I'll bring you fried dumplings
Bear your name.

954
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:41,455
Well, you guarantee me a bit,
I love you too.

955
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,788
Go and achieve success.

956
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,910
I will do, young man.

957
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:51,499
See you later,

958
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:52,834
Dad.

959
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,070
I was bothering you
Long ago, "Murphy".

960
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,436
I think I deserved it.
Most often.

961
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,110
This is the smartest thing you
have ever said in your life.

962
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,117
Listen, Joe.

963
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:28,414
Whatever you do,
You do not have to.

964
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,793
There is always another way.

965
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:35,456
It is my business, boy,
Forget that you know.

966
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,337
In the end, if I do not,
You have to take responsibility.

967
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:42,085
I can no longer cover you.

968
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,139
You are a father.

969
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:47,603
You must take responsibility
She acts like a man.

970
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,479
Even if you have to pretend to do so.

971
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,310
Well.

972
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,160
Welcome to Carnival,
Donations of "Nets" charity!

973
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:10,406
Well, sir, let us mix with the crowds.

974
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:29,389
Three consecutive injuries
You get an award!

975
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,229
Hello, "Polly"
Is the weather hot enough for you?

976
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,606
It's a perfect day.

977
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:40,694
I have to check with the ticket office.

978
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,363
Be sensible.

979
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:46,029
I will not be wise, but I will be careful.

980
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:50,236
2.14 pm.

981
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,500
Well, thanks.

982
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,458
You are famous.

983
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:01,337
Yes, the reason is cocaine.

984
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:03,798
Do you sell cocaine?

985
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:05,296
I was joking, Milton.

986
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:08,467
Well, that's very funny.

987
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:11,177
Stay here,
I have to check the karaoke machine.

988
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,178
I can not,
Go to the Yarn Girls' Booth.

989
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,561
"Milton," you are in it now.

990
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:20,403
It's okay, you'd better not know.

991
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:27,277
The shop is closed, run out of cocaine.

992
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:28,991
Leave.

993
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:30,947
Leave.

994
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:36,755
Mobile toilet.

995
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:41,919
Fear Factory.

996
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:44,707
Watch out inside,
There are many monsters.

997
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:47,717
Be careful, watch out for your steps.

998
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:51,095
Time to work!

999
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:53,433
I'll go, Sam.

1000
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,064
- Where did they go?
- I do not know!

1001
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:58,387
I thought they were with you!

1002
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,567
2.30 pm

1003
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:10,528
I decided to use empty shots.

1004
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:13,079
No one should be hurt by mistake.

1005
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:15,293
There are none left now, boys.

1006
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:16,964
You guys,

1007
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:21,422
I have had a wonderful time
In planning to steal with you.

1008
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:26,262
There is no better of you
to do this with him.

1009
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:28,173
I agree with you.

1010
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:30,546
And I too.

1011
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:47,493
Williamsburg Savings Bank

1012
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:55,699
2.45 pm.

1013
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,423
Ladies and gentlemen.

1014
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:07,706
This is a real robbery.

1015
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:10,055
Lie down, do not breathe.

1016
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,857
Do not move.
Do not touch the silent alarm.

1017
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,965
Unless you want
To pierce your head.

1018
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,428
Lie down, you big!

1019
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:17,598
Throw your gun away.

1020
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,940
Well guys, We'll get out of
your life two minutes later.

1021
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,614
Move, Blue Eyes.

1022
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:24,812
Here we are.

1023
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:27,903
Dear tellers,
Please stand up and open your windows.

1024
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:33,823
Ten seconds.

1025
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:39,252
No dye packs or tracking devices.

1026
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:40,753
Do you understand?
No tracking devices,

1027
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,714
Do not pack dyes, do not try to manipulate.

1028
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,215
Yes sir Sinatra.

1029
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:48,921
No one will be hurt. Ten thirty 00: 59:
47,462 -> 00: 59: 48,84220 seconds.

1030
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:52,298
Thank you.

1031
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:53,676
Go ahead, madam.

1032
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:55,054
Do not try to manipulate,
Do you understand what I mean?

1033
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:56,304
Yes, yes.

1034
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:58,143
Put all the money, son.

1035
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,095
30 seconds.

1036
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,400
Give me everything you have.

1037
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:09,029
You can take it, sir.

1038
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:13,197
40 seconds.

1039
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:20,326
Hey, stick to the plan.

1040
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:25,747
To all units,
They went to Williamsburg.

1041
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:28,798
There is a theft,
I repeat, there is a process of theft.

1042
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:30,671
Min!

1043
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:32,926
I do not want to take your
blood, my sweetheart.

1044
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:34,878
When my granddaughter was like your age,

1045
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,052
She had one like her.

1046
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,390
What's her name?

1047
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:39,014
Well, my dear, this guy.

1048
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,271
He has a job to do.

1049
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:42,182
His work stealing banks?

1050
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:45,981
No, my dear,
I try to see my family more.

1051
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:48,272
Stupid.

1052
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:53,112
What's going on?

1053
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,870
Are you okay sir

1054
01:00:58,867 --> 01:00:59,987
I will need some help.

1055
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,624
He will need some help.

1056
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:03,998
Oh heaven!

1057
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,673
I'll do it.

1058
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:08,845
Stay where you are.

1059
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,092
Oh my God!

1060
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:12,305
"Lucy"!

1061
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,425
His mask is too hot on him.

1062
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:19,682
Thank you my love, thank you.

1063
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:23,314
I can not breathe
When I wear masks, too.

1064
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:24,765
You are very nice.

1065
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:28,563
Two minutes.

1066
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:30,773
The police.

1067
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:37,696
What is going on in Heaven?

1068
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,375
Can you get out of here?

1069
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:40,533
Yes, I'm fine.

1070
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:42,827
It's time, boy.

1071
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:44,255
Stay at school, girl.

1072
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:46,117
Do not shoot the banks, do you hear me?

1073
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,290
Come on!

1074
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,499
Quickly!

1075
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:53,796
This is my bank!

1076
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:55,554
Are you crazy?

1077
01:01:55,716 --> 01:01:57,506
Do not move! I do not move?

1078
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,966
I'm not telling me not to move,
You do not move!

1079
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:02,137
I will not be a victim anymore.

1080
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:04,473
Ask them not to move too.

1081
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,351
They can hear you well.

1082
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:07,518
What plan now?

1083
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:08,896
I work on one.

1084
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:10,362
Lift up your hands.

1085
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:12,522
And leave the money.

1086
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:15,821
Well, after three seconds,
I will shoot you.

1087
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:16,986
What?

1088
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:18,514
I will respond to you by shooting!

1089
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,610
Is this your plan?

1090
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:20,781
One!

1091
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:23,159
Two!

1092
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:26,705
The next figure is three!

1093
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:28,122
I can count.

1094
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,210
He will shoot us.

1095
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:33,294
Three!

1096
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:50,357
You are a failure in the
correction, O shouted.

1097
01:02:50,812 --> 01:02:52,982
Now you will meet your Creator.

1098
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,398
Oh my God!

1099
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,155
Oh my God!

1100
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:01,322
Oh my God!

1101
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,990
Oh my God!

1102
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:07,081
Oh my God!

1103
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,588
It's empty shots you idiot.

1104
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:17,761
Well guys, enemy of 90 descending
Loud.

1105
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:20,723
Do not stand until we get out of here.

1106
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,344
Start counting!

1107
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:25,561
90, 89, 88, 87, 86..

1108
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:38,692
2.49 pm.

1109
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:39,861
What's up, Willy?

1110
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:42,858
Nothing, I felt a bit tired,
I'm fine.

1111
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,491
It was a very bad time
to get a panic attack!

1112
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:45,658
I'm sorry.

1113
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:47,036
No need for this.

1114
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:48,242
The hard part is over.

1115
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:51,292
It is time for the big conclusion.

1116
01:03:55,043 --> 01:03:58,133
3.17 pm.

1117
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:17,148
Taxi! Taxi!

1118
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:18,686
Not bad.

1119
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:21,608
To Astoria, Queens, please.

1120
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,580
City bus "New York".

1121
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:57,402
It will not stop soon.

1122
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,442
He will lose consciousness in the end.

1123
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:07,528
Dear Sir,

1124
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:09,409
Do you want some sweetening?

1125
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:11,366
What kind of pancakes do you have?

1126
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:15,367
Lemon cake,
Plant gourd, cherry and mango.

1127
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,291
One slice of each.

1128
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:19,039
And more champagne.

1129
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:20,421
Yes, more champagne.

1130
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:22,083
I'll get the champagne then.

1131
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:56,664
No more wine for you.

1132
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:59,582
Prove your place, you can not bear wine.

1133
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,131
The reason is not wine.

1134
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:04,546
What? Hey, why not wine?

1135
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:08,177
You can call an ambulance please?
I beg you?

1136
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:10,849
What hurts you, "Willie"?

1137
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:13,312
Everything.

1138
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:15,516
Oh my God.

1139
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:17,234
Heck.

1140
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,404
The place is wet.

1141
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:19,902
Call an ambulance!

1142
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,690
It happened quickly.

1143
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,150
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1144
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,410
Near the picture.

1145
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,495
Fix the frame there.

1146
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:33,988
African-American?

1147
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,161
It seems so.

1148
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:38,459
It must be at least
In the late 1960s.

1149
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,629
Take static photos of others.

1150
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:43,458
I want to publish it everywhere.

1151
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:46,014
Did not he ever talk about it?

1152
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:47,173
He did not say anything.

1153
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,255
He hides his affairs a lot.

1154
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:52,427
He is extremely emotional.

1155
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:55,811
Willy suffers from kidney failure.

1156
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,444
Needs total cultivation.

1157
01:06:58,602 --> 01:06:59,882
What will happen if he does not?

1158
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,520
Let's say he will not leave
the hospital without her.

1159
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,900
They must have been young and flexible.

1160
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:08,858
They were shot several times,

1161
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:11,609
They managed to avoid all the shots.

1162
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,782
I work there a month ago,

1163
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:16,541
The bank has been robbed twice.

1164
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,955
I think I'll go back to my previous job
As a waiter in a cafe,

1165
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,282
Where the opportunity is less to be exposed
For a fire.

1166
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,416
All I can say, Is thank god Ali!

1167
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:26,876
It was a heroic day.

1168
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:28,127
Hello!

1169
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:31,968
We are famous.

1170
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,885
But better.

1171
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,934
Lower your voice,
We have not been out of danger yet.

1172
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,732
So what's going on, Willie?

1173
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,149
Do not talk to us,
Do not tell us you're sick.

1174
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,824
We are friends, we must stand together.

1175
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,650
This is my business.

1176
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,280
Your business? It's your business.

1177
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,316
The word "Joe", I can not.
Old, selfish.

1178
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:00,825
I do not understand, "woe".

1179
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:03,168
I was to give you my kidney last week.

1180
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,668
Most likely it does not suit me.

1181
01:08:06,837 --> 01:08:08,837
I used to give it to you anyway.

1182
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,354
We are friends, "Willy".

1183
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:19,143
We're supposed to take
care of each other, right?

1184
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:22,845
Let's take care of you, we agreed?

1185
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:27,356
Waiting area.

1186
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:33,454
The suspects are armed and dangerous,

1187
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,874
Probably in the late 1960s
Or the early 1970s.

1188
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:38,492
They were disguised as Triple Rat,

1189
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,160
Customer "Heimer" - Crime
Investigation Division.

1190
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:43,159
"Dean Martin",
Frank Sinatra and Sami Davies Gunner.

1191
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:45,499
Let's go from here.

1192
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:49,127
Published by the FBI
This tape is for burglary.

1193
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,876
If you have information,
Please call the number shown on the screen.

1194
01:08:57,638 --> 01:09:00,468
I knew as soon as I saw the watch bar
Of the bank.

1195
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:02,891
Same length and weight.

1196
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,230
Many match these specifications.

1197
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,145
Yes, but who runs that way?

1198
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:17,571
We'll need a copy of this video.

1199
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:20,041
I have a copy here.

1200
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:22,414
I think there is a reward.

1201
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:23,709
Reward?

1202
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,752
Yes, I need money,
My grandmother was arrested last night.

1203
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,317
You know how it is, right, brother?

1204
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:46,274
- "Annie".
- Yes.

1205
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:47,936
I must speak with you.

1206
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:51,191
I lost this age yesterday.

1207
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,608
Did the tooth fairy come?

1208
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:53,896
She brought me five dollars.

1209
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:56,364
Five... You are a renegade.

1210
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:58,450
You know that the most I've ever gotten
Is a quarter of a dollar?

1211
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:01,025
You can not buy anything anymore
A quarter of a dollar, my grandfather.

1212
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:02,291
My presence and nothing.

1213
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,120
"Willie"?

1214
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:07,252
These guys are with the FBI.

1215
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,424
FBI?

1216
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:14,963
They must have brought me all together.

1217
01:10:22,097 --> 01:10:23,307
Third successful strike!

1218
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:24,563
Well done, girl.

1219
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:25,935
Yes!

1220
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:27,731
This is my girl!

1221
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,690
New York police

1222
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:43,987
I have to go to the toilet.

1223
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:45,791
Well.

1224
01:10:46,496 --> 01:10:48,326
That was great, Brock.

1225
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,282
Here's my opinion.

1226
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:23,117
An old man finds himself
Amid a bank robbery,

1227
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:24,833
This makes him feel thrilled.

1228
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,873
He thinks of himself,

1229
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:29,288
"I can steal a bank."

1230
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,207
"I'm smart."

1231
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,545
"I have nothing to lose."

1232
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,380
"What's the worst that might happen?"

1233
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:37,666
"I can spend the rest of my life."

1234
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,050
"In a prison like a country club
Without paying rent."

1235
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,048
Have you gone to school to do this work?

1236
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:48,393
Well, Mr. Garner,

1237
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:52,229
You seem to have disappeared for an hour.

1238
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:55,566
Between 2.30 and 3.30 pm.

1239
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:58,692
At the same time
Carried out by three elderly men.

1240
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,401
Stole $ 2.3 million.

1241
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:02,912
Of the Williamsburg Savings Bank.

1242
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:05,743
Amazing, what a great profit.

1243
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:10,750
I was working in a house of terror
Between 2 and 4 pm?

1244
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:12,004
That's what I said.

1245
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,083
Did you never leave that game?

1246
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:17,001
Just to enter it.

1247
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:21,592
I got up as usual, at six in the morning.

1248
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,092
I accompanied my granddaughter to school.

1249
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,011
As I do every day.

1250
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,390
It's a fairly new relationship,
So we spend a lot of time together.

1251
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:35,059
Lennar, in the early morning,
We practiced love twice.

1252
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:38,938
No.

1253
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,109
Three times.

1254
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,570
That was all.

1255
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:45,448
Annie Santuri.

1256
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:49,123
Then we got up, and I had fried pies.

1257
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:51,246
Then I put on my clothes.

1258
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:54,293
I get dressed,
I ate breakfast at the Nat restaurant.

1259
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,538
I go there.

1260
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:58,169
A few times a week at least.

1261
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:00,297
For years, he has been
a permanent customer.

1262
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,130
Do you meet one of them?

1263
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:06,141
I am married and have two children.

1264
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,013
Take digital, things usually happen.

1265
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:11,465
I wore my clothes.

1266
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,520
The cards were collected
for the gaming booth.

1267
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:16,646
I am in the fundraising committee,

1268
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,650
Well guys, good luck to all of us.

1269
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:22,783
It's time to get into the bag.

1270
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,305
I went to the park about a second.

1271
01:13:24,363 --> 01:13:26,703
I spoke with my friend
"Paul" for a few minutes,

1272
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,485
Then you run one of the ticket booths.

1273
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:29,829
The tickets.

1274
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:30,993
Hello Tony.

1275
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:32,161
Good evening.

1276
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:33,499
I brought you a gift.

1277
01:13:33,872 --> 01:13:35,872
Thank you "Joe", you need a hat.

1278
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,541
I stayed there during most
of the Carnival period.

1279
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:42,801
They will all say they bought it
From an old handsome.

1280
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,305
He wears a gray hat.

1281
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:47,837
Then we went to the festival,

1282
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:50,506
I was working in a girls' spinning booth
Until the second,

1283
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:53,181
Then a local solution Mr. "Milton Kubchak".

1284
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:56,062
Al was there all day.

1285
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:57,518
At 2.30 pm?

1286
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,481
- Who?
- "Al"?

1287
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:00,648
"Garner"?

1288
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,034
Yes.

1289
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:03,322
Is he here?

1290
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:08,744
You know what? At the
girls' spinning booth,

1291
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,657
Try to sell some cocaine.

1292
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:14,702
I am ready to give my testimony.

1293
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:16,662
Children love horror houses.

1294
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:29,184
Frankenstein is one of
their favorite characters.

1295
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,554
I must have been there
More than an hour.

1296
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:46,899
Yes, I've had stomach problems for years
Due to over-drinking.

1297
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:49,039
It is called inflammation
of the intestines,

1298
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:53,032
Says the doctor
I have to remove part of my colon.

1299
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:54,622
I do not like that idea very much.

1300
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:20,976
So, between approximately
2.30 and 3.30 hours,

1301
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:22,726
You are.

1302
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:25,821
In the toilet?

1303
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:26,994
Yes.

1304
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:30,612
It's boring,
But I take what I always read with me.

1305
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:32,778
Helps to spend time.

1306
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,790
After that, I met my girlfriend,

1307
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:38,873
And we sing along with the karaoke machine.

1308
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:41,039
Wixler Mining Company.

1309
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:47,626
Admission allowed.

1310
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:10,654
What happens then?

1311
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:13,662
Oh my God!

1312
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:16,659
Watch out!

1313
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,503
Do you mind washing my dirty clothes?

1314
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,671
Absolutely.

1315
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,529
Overall,
It was a nice day at the Carnival.

1316
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:57,239
Hate your best blow.

1317
01:16:57,409 --> 01:16:58,789
Water basin They made a spray!

1318
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:15,049
Awesome!
A coherent story, Mr. Harding.

1319
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:18,137
Makes it easy to remember the truth.

1320
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:23,141
Yes, almost perfect.

1321
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:26,728
But let me tell you
something about criminals.

1322
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:31,688
They always make a silly mistake.

1323
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:34,742
Spoil their entire scheme.

1324
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,585
I want you to go with me
On a trip Hey Harding.

1325
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:23,084
Get out of the gym,
There is official work.

1326
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:24,295
What is this right?

1327
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:25,574
Get out the back door there.

1328
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:28,536
Well, come on guys, quickly, come on.

1329
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,388
Fast, fast.

1330
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:49,982
Here, stand by them.

1331
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:29,637
I want you to start that
guy there, we agreed?

1332
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,151
Look well at his face.

1333
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,990
I do not see him.

1334
01:21:04,323 --> 01:21:05,323
What?

1335
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:07,911
It is not here.

1336
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:10,536
Are you sure?

1337
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:12,004
Yes, I'm sure.

1338
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:15,584
I have a wonderful memory.

1339
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:22,668
Listen, do you want to look again?

1340
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:24,341
Not really.

1341
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:29,014
Can I go home now?

1342
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,306
Yes.

1343
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:07,225
Restaurant "Nat"

1344
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,364
I thought you would not come.

1345
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,186
Well, here I am.

1346
01:22:27,531 --> 01:22:29,531
What good dish are they
offering here, Joey?

1347
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,030
Nothing really.

1348
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,371
Why come then?

1349
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:34,156
I love bad coffee.

1350
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:35,959
Yes, I understand that.

1351
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,540
He got all his vaccines.

1352
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:42,169
Dog, tuberculosis, pordetaila,
And you singled out.

1353
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,047
All sheets are organized.

1354
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:45,344
Have you taken your share?

1355
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:48,387
No, not from you.

1356
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:53,061
It is the duty of society
to care for the elderly.

1357
01:22:55,559 --> 01:22:58,729
It is the duty of society
to care for the elderly.

1358
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,190
Where is the tattoo?

1359
01:23:07,905 --> 01:23:09,495
It's a temporary tattoo, my friend.

1360
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:14,656
See a person with a weak look
A picture he can not forget.

1361
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:18,667
The police will look for years.

1362
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:21,422
This tattoo looks like
a ring in my opinion.

1363
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,255
If we find this artist, we
will find the criminal.

1364
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:24,462
Police draw for tattoo.

1365
01:23:24,922 --> 01:23:26,512
This is impressive.

1366
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,433
It is a tragedy.

1367
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:37,558
FBI directly behind you.

1368
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:42,441
Customer "Heimer".

1369
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,032
Do you want to drink bad coffee?

1370
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:51,067
I have an allergy of milk, Mr. Harding.

1371
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:53,951
I left these in the evidence room.

1372
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:58,544
How did you find me?

1373
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:00,575
That's what I do.

1374
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:02,039
I find people.

1375
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,130
This is my friend "Jesus".

1376
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:12,554
It houses dogs.

1377
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,719
Private client "Heimer",
From the FBI.

1378
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:17,308
"Jesus Garcia", from the
neighborhood of "Queens".

1379
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:24,307
Will you adopt a dog, Mr. Harding?

1380
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:26,571
Yes, it's my granddaughter.

1381
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:28,823
She excelled at school.

1382
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:31,067
This is awesome.

1383
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:33,238
I love puppies.

1384
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:34,657
Do you mind?

1385
01:24:34,825 --> 01:24:36,125
He may be asleep.

1386
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,755
It's okay, I will not wake him up.

1387
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:42,173
O heaven,
Are not you a small pet?

1388
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:44,792
Let me look at you with your wrinkled face.

1389
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,170
When I was young,

1390
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:49,196
I grew up with Boulder Cooley dogs.

1391
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:52,429
This breed is wonderful,
I love the Coley Border dogs.

1392
01:24:52,593 --> 01:24:55,353
Yes, it's great.

1393
01:24:55,512 --> 01:24:57,972
Yes, come here, little one.

1394
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:01,520
It is small and silvery.

1395
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:04,345
Well, come here, little one.

1396
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:06,855
Yes, come here.

1397
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,860
You little villain.

1398
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:15,701
Watch out, his teeth are still growing.

1399
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:17,026
Yes.

1400
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:18,541
You should be careful of his sharp teeth.

1401
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:19,702
Thanks.

1402
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,620
We do not want you to bleed to death.

1403
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:28,039
I have to take this young man home.

1404
01:25:28,212 --> 01:25:30,212
Before my granddaughter
returned from school.

1405
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,050
What a nice surprise to her.

1406
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:33,716
You will be surprised a lot.

1407
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:36,054
Do you have a dog now client "Heimer"?

1408
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,800
No, the reason is practical.

1409
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:39,851
Long working hours.

1410
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:41,345
I can not do this with an animal.

1411
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:44,517
OK,
Take this young man to his new home.

1412
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,285
Hugs and kisses Young.

1413
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:54,571
You annoy me with these quarters.

1414
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,788
Someone left this gift.

1415
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:17,719
Great piece.

1416
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,466
Cut them off.

1417
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:29,773
"Everyone deserves his share of the pie."

1418
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:35,989
Everyone deserves his share of pie!

1419
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,418
Sorry, Mr. "Garner".

1420
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:51,292
You are not stronger than this.

1421
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:52,461
I'm not solid.

1422
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:54,511
I am a very sensitive person.

1423
01:26:55,174 --> 01:26:56,804
I will be honest with you.

1424
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:59,142
I do not want to die today.

1425
01:26:59,303 --> 01:27:00,353
This is new.

1426
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:03,642
But if I die, I want to say.

1427
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:07,187
You were a great classmate and friend.

1428
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:09,522
For 25 years.

1429
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,320
25 years? Has all this time passed?

1430
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:14,322
Looks like 25 days, right?

1431
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:15,494
Yes.

1432
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:17,532
Under water.

1433
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,276
Good teaser.

1434
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:22,158
Well, sir, we'll start.

1435
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:31,539
They say in life.

1436
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,040
Come here!

1437
01:27:33,212 --> 01:27:37,842
If you are lucky, you will get
On a couple of wonderful friends.

1438
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:42,886
People are standing by you to the end.

1439
01:27:43,472 --> 01:27:48,022
You grow up together,
You see and do everything together,

1440
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:51,355
They laugh and cry together.

1441
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:55,364
"Al Garner"
He was one of those people to me.

1442
01:27:57,694 --> 01:28:01,534
There will not be many men like him.

1443
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:05,368
Someone willing to risk everything
For others.

1444
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:07,696
Ready to make a nice word.

1445
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,211
Or college.

1446
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:11,883
With complaint about it all the time.

1447
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:13,082
That's you.

1448
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:15,342
This is not entirely true.

1449
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:19,632
- "Annie".
- Yes.

1450
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,930
It's your problem now.

1451
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:22,093
Thanks.

1452
01:28:22,261 --> 01:28:27,061
Good luck, may you enjoy
Every moment of your time together.

1453
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:28,224
We love you.

1454
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:30,727
We love you also, young man.

1455
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:32,194
We toast you all!

1456
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:33,364
We toast you!

1457
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:36,822
To clap the bride and their names!

1458
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:22,111
I will adjust my expectations, Joey.

1459
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:23,779
What do you mean?

1460
01:29:24,656 --> 01:29:26,486
I may live another twenty years.

1461
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:28,578
Not with college "Al".

1462
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:31,004
You will live for ten years at most.

1463
01:29:31,163 --> 01:29:32,913
It's OK, I'll accept that.

1464
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,500
He has come.

1465
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:37,251
What speeches?

1466
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:41,089
My face hurts me,
I have not smiled like this all my life.

1467
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:43,836
So? How do you feel?

1468
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:45,299
What?

1469
01:29:45,469 --> 01:29:47,969
You are married, you idiot.

1470
01:29:48,138 --> 01:29:50,638
I do not know how this happened.

1471
01:29:50,807 --> 01:29:53,637
I do not even remember asking for her hand.

1472
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:58,020
I do not even remember asking for her hand.

1473
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:00,650
It's wonderful.

1474
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:03,027
I mean, it's exciting,
We practice love a lot.

1475
01:30:03,195 --> 01:30:05,325
She is a brilliant cook.

1476
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:07,489
And love me as I am.

1477
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:09,828
So I do not like myself as I am.

1478
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:12,293
Everything is stunning,
But I have to admit.

1479
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:16,794
I have a strange feeling,
I think it might be happiness.

1480
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:22,632
Your cup has been officially filled.

1481
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:32,889
"Go style."

1482
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:10,355
"Go style"
