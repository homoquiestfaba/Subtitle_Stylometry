Hank.

367
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,241
Get up.

368
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:07,916
[panting]

369
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,441
Come on.

370
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:18,426
We've been combing
from top to bottom

371
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:19,427
The security guard
gave a tour.

372
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,930
There's no one
inside this place.

373
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,430
I know what I saw.

374
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,432
There had to be
50 people in that room

375
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:26,434
You said 30 before.

376
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:27,936
50, 30--
it was dark.

377
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,437
What difference
does it make?

378
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:31,439
And half of them
were, uh...

379
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,941
(John)
Were what?

380
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:35,944
Hank, what were they?

381
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:38,947
Listen, if there's something
you're not tellingme,

382
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:42,450
now's the time.

383
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:42,951
Okay.

384
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:47,455
This is going to sound crazy,
but I think they were, uh...

385
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,457
Were what?

386
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:51,960
Vampires.

387
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,962
[laughter]

388
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:54,462
Vampires.

389
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:56,464
Yeah, look, I know
that sounds crazy,

390
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:57,465
but how do you
explain this?

391
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,968
I thought you said
you got that in a scuffle.

392
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:04,973
Then again, drunks fall
down all the time, don't they?

393
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,474
I wasn't drunk.

394
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:09,034
You had nothing to drink
last night?

395
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:13,982
Hmm?

396
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:15,483
You better
come clean, Hank,

397
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:16,985
because I had
the paramedic out there.

398
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,987
He took a blood sample
from your neck.

399
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:19,988
A blood sample?

400
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:21,489
Shots were fired.

401
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:21,990
It's out of my hands.

402
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,993
If there's something
you're not tellingme,

403
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:25,493
now's the time.

404
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:27,996
All right;
all right.

405
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,998
I had a couple beers,

406
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:32,000
and there was
some marijuana.

407
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,501
Marijuana?

408
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:36,504
This girl, Layla, she put
some kind of spell on me,

409
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:37,005
I'm telling you.

410
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,007
When I looked into her eyes,
it was like--

411
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,509
Are you tellingme
a college girl bit your neck?

412
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:45,013
No, that was
this other thing.

413
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:45,513
It wasn't even human.

414
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:47,515
It must have been
their leader or something.

415
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:51,019
It picked me up and starting
sucking the blood fromme.

416
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,520
And then the sun came--

417
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,522
Enough;
enough!

418
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:55,523
[laughter]

419
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:59,027
John, I know this sounds insane,
but you got to believe me.

420
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,028
You know what I believe?

421
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:01,029
I believe
you lied to me.

422
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:02,530
I believe
you were drinking,

423
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,532
and I believe
you were smoking dope.

424
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:05,033
Whatever.

425
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,534
And you woke up here
for some reason,

426
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,036
and the security guard
happened by.

427
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:10,538
And you came up
with this ridiculous story

428
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:12,040
to save your ass.

429
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,041
No, no,John,
I'm telling you,

430
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,043
this girl had
some kind of powers.

431
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:16,544

Captain.

432
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,045
What?

433
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,047
Give it to me.

434

[plastic crinkling]

435
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:22,050
You recognize these?

436
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,552
.380 slugs?

437
00:30:24,552 --> 00:30:25,053
Yeah,from your .380.

438
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:28,056
The forensics have been
digging them out of the wall

439
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,058
in that room where
you tell me that you

440
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,559
and your vampires
were partying.

441
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,560
The walls.

442
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,562
Right, you told me
you hit her point-blank.

443
00:30:34,562 --> 00:30:35,563
Isn't that
what you said?

444
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:38,066
I put three shots
into that girl point-blank,

445
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:40,068
and I emptied my clip
in several others.

446
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:42,832
Any signs
ofblood or tissue?

447
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:45,073
Nothing.

448
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:46,074
Let me see your gun.

449
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:47,075

454
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:55,583
As of this moment.

455
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,584
We're done here.

456
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,086
Let me see your badge.

457
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:59,087
Give it to me.

458
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:00,588
John.

459
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,090
Come on.

460
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,592
You ever want
to see this again,

you get yourself some help--
and I mean professional help.

462
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,097
You take a month;
take as longas you need.

463
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:13,101
But if you ever even think of
trying to come back on the job,

464
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:15,103
you better get
your shit together.

465
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,104
John, listen--

466
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:18,436
Do we understand
each other?

467
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:21,609
Yeah.

468
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:23,111
Come on;
let's go.

Hiya, lover boy.

00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,768
A shame you threw
that beer away.

I'm a little
parched myself.

482
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,273
That's part of it,
the thirst.

483
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:08,776
At first it's beer,
water, whatever.

484
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:09,777
Then it's--

00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:11,779
Hank.

486
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:15,283
You know what they say
about boys who play with guns.

487
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,785
They're just
overcompensatingfor--

488
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:23,791
well, but then we both know that
you don't have that problem

489
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:24,792
don't we, Hank?

490
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:27,295
I shot you three times.

491
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:27,795
I know.

00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:30,298
That really wasn't
very nice.

Back off.

494
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:34,802
Hank, you are really
starting to bore me.

495
00:34:34,802 --> 00:34:35,803
Please put the gun down.

00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:43,978
Besides, if I wanted
to kill you,

500
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:46,481
I would have done it
way before now.

I remember when
I was first bitten.

I thought
I was going to die.

506
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:56,491
Well, actually,
I sort of did,

507
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:57,492
but only for a few days.

508
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:58,993
This is
the worst part, though.

are going to feel like years,

don't even know what hit you.

You wake up, and it's like
you start a whole new life.

like it's going out of style,

you have never
had sex like this.

Shoot her.

548
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,085
She's a vampire!

549
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,110
Ahh!

550
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:40,152
[choking]

551
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:45,600
There she is behind you.

552
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,101
[hisses]

553
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,603
[roars]

554
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:49,797
Ahh!

555
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,111
Look at it, Hank.

556
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:58,112
[panting]

557
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:02,105
Doesn't it
look delicious?

558
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,626
[knocking]

559
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:14,424
You still here?

560
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,631
What'd you do?

561
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:19,691
Stay here and party
all night or something?

562
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,142
Where are they?

563
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,143
Who?

564
00:37:29,143 --> 00:37:30,144
The two cops

565
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:30,645
that were killed.

566
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:32,146
They were right here
last night.

567
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,648
She killed them
right here.

568
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:35,149
I don't want
no trouble, all right?

569
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:37,743
You can't keep hanging
around here.

570
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:41,656
How come there are no
security guards here at night?

571
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:45,159
Last night, the night before,
there were no security guards.

572
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:45,660
I don't know, man.

573
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,662
I just punch the clock
in the mornings,

574
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:49,163
do my thing,
then I go home--

575
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:50,665
which is what
you'd better do

576
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:53,225
before I call
that captain of yours.

577
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,672
Man, you need a shower

578
00:37:57,672 --> 00:37:59,173
or something.

579
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:00,174
Don't you have a wife

580
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:02,506
you can go home to?

581
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:07,181
What did you say?

582
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:12,186
Look, man, if you want to
smell bad, that's your business.

583
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:13,187
My wife.

584
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:13,688
Yeah.

585
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:16,691
Why didn't I
think of that?

586
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:20,695
Don't be expecting to get
no pussy smelling like that,

587
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:23,698
crazy, mother-fucking
bitch-ass white boy.

588
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,222
[car engine starts]

589
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:41,010
[panting]

590
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:49,223
Jesus, Hank.

591
00:38:49,223 --> 00:38:50,224
What are you
doing here?

592
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:52,226
I need your help.

593
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:53,728
You look awful.

594
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:54,729
What happened to you?

595
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:58,232
Yeah, well, that's why
I need your help.

596
00:38:58,232 --> 00:39:00,234
You're not making
any sense.

597
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:03,738
And I wish to God
you'd stop stalkingme.

598
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:05,740
I-I-I wasn't
stalking you.

599
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,241
I was never stalking you.

600
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:07,742
I was just--

601
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:08,743
Good-bye, Hank.

602
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,244
Wait; wait;
wait; wait.

603
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,245
I need to talk to you.

604
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:12,747
Let go of my arm

605
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:16,751
Okay, okay.

606
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,752
I don't know
how to say this.

607
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:20,755
It's going
to sound crazy.

608
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:22,757
I was bitten
by a vampire.

609
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:23,758
[scoffs]

610
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:25,760
I know;
I know; I know.

611
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,261
Just hear me out.

612
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:29,263
My neck, look.

613
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,264
Look at my neck.

614
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,767
Oh, that looks infected.

615
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,268
Have you seen a doctor?

616
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:35,770
I don't need a doctor.

617
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,270
I need you.

618
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,773
You've written
all those books on vampires.

619
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:40,274
You're an expert.

620
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:43,971
Hank, this is so pathetic.

621
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,280
I have nowhere else
to turn.

622
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,782
Please, I'm telling
you the truth.

623
00:39:47,782 --> 00:39:49,784
You're really starting
to scare me.

624
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:52,787
Now, I'm warning you,
don't come any closer.

625
00:39:52,787 --> 00:39:55,289
Just give me
five minutes.

626
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,290
Tell me what to do.

627
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,351
They have these special powers,
and their strength is...

628
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:04,298
I'm sorry I never read
any of your books.

629
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:07,301
And I'm--

630
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,805
I'm sorry that I was
married to my job.

631
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:15,309
I'm sorry for whatever
I did to make you leave me.

632
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:16,811
Just please help me.

633
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:19,814
Is this guy
bothering you, ma'am?

634
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:20,314
Yes.

635
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:22,316
Buddy, why don't
you just move along?

636
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:23,317
This is none
of your business.

637
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:27,151
Well, I'mmaking it
my business.

638
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,324
Ah!

639
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:31,552
Whoa!

640
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:38,833
(Hank)
Susan--

641
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:39,667
[panting]

642
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,669
Ahh!

643
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:45,730
[continues yelling]

644
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:27,578
[engine starts]

645
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:22,770
[vehicle approaches]

646
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:28,003
[police radio
drones distantly]

647
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,289
(man #l)
Show me your hands.

648
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:43,290
Get out of the car.

649
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:46,088
Get out of the car.

650
00:42:48,295 --> 00:42:49,296
(man #2)
Turn around.

651
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:51,799
I said, ''Turn around.''

652
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:53,300
Hands on the car.

653
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,791
Get your hands
on the car.

654
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:02,969
[door slams]

655
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:06,313
Susan?

656
00:43:06,313 --> 00:43:07,815
Sit down.

657
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:08,816
I'm sorry, Hank.

658
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:09,817
You didn't leave me
much choice.

659
00:43:09,817 --> 00:43:13,320
Susan swore out a complaint
against you for stalking her.

660
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,322
Captain Billings and I
have been talking.

661
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:18,325
I'm willing to drop the
complaint if you'll get help.

662
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:19,827
This has got
to stop, Hank.

663
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:20,327
[books slam]

664
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:23,831
Susan, I bought those books
to try and find out--

665
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:26,834
You're living out of your car
with tinfoil on the windows.

666
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:28,335
You've admitted
not sleeping.

667
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:30,337
You're abusing
drugs and alcohol,

668
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:30,838
and now this with Susan.

669
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,341
We have some people on
the way here who can help you.

670
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:37,344
People on the way?

671
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,848
You mean like men in white suits
with butterfly nets?

672
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:41,348
That kind of people?

673
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:42,850
This is
an intervention.

674
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,841
It could be very civilized...

675
00:43:47,021 --> 00:43:47,521
or get very ugly.

676
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:50,024
Susan, what I was trying
to tell you today is true.

677
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:52,026
It's really
happening to me.

678
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:52,526
[gasps]

679
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:54,528
What's the matter?

680
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:55,529
The mirror.

681
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:57,031
(John)
What?

682
00:43:57,031 --> 00:43:59,033
Hank had
no reflection.

683
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:00,557
What?

684
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:03,537
[groans]
Oh, God.

685
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:05,664
I need some water.

686
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,041
Look at my neck.

687
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:12,035
Just get me some
fucking water, please.

688
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:15,549
Ahh!

689
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:17,551
I want to withdraw
my complaint.

690
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:19,553
What?

691
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:21,055
You can release him
to my custody.

692
00:44:21,055 --> 00:44:22,556
I'll take
full responsibility.

693
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:24,558
Listen, he's a friend.

694
00:44:24,558 --> 00:44:26,060
I'm trying to help him

695
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,560
What are you doing?

696
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,562
We're not
legally divorced yet.

697
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:30,564
Technically,
I'm still his wife.

698
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:32,566
Please;
I've changed my mind.

699
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:36,570
You can't hold himhere if
I withdraw the complaint, right?

700
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,072
Right.

701
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:42,576
Then that's what
I want to do.

702
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:43,077
[sighs]

703
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:45,579
Maybe you two are
meant for each other after all.

704
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:49,083
I know what happened
to Haskell and Wexler.

705
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:49,583
What?

706
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:51,585
The two cops
that went missing.

707
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:52,586
They were killed

708
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:55,089
by one of the same vampires
that did this to me.

709
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:56,590
Get him out ofhere.

710
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:57,591
John, I was there.

711
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:58,092
I saw it happen.

712
00:44:58,092 --> 00:45:01,357
Get out ofhere
before I change my mind.

713
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:06,600
Come on, we have
a lot to talk about.

714
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,601
What about my gun?

715
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:08,602
They took my gun.

716
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:09,103
You won't need that.

717
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:10,604
You don't understand.

718
00:45:10,604 --> 00:45:11,105
They'll come for me.

719
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:12,606
No, Hank,
it won't do any good.

720
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:14,108
[groans]
I think I'm gonna be sick.

721
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:17,111
[vomiting
and coughing]

722
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:20,614
[moans]

723
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:23,117
Oh, God.

724
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:24,118
[groans]

725
00:45:24,118 --> 00:45:25,517
Drink this.

726
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:31,625
[laughs]

727
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:34,128
[choking]

728
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:35,129
Stop it, Hank.

729
00:45:35,129 --> 00:45:36,630
Let go.

730
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,131
Susan.

731
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:38,132
[exhales]

732
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:39,633
Susan.

733
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:41,135
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:41,135 --> 00:45:42,136
I'm sorry you're--

735
00:45:42,136 --> 00:45:43,137
It's okay.

736
00:45:43,137 --> 00:45:44,638
It's okay.

737
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:45,639
It's okay.

738
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:47,141
Oh, my God.

739
00:45:47,141 --> 00:45:50,644
Hank, you have
to drink this.

740
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:52,646
What is it?

741
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:54,148
Wolfsbane.

742
00:45:54,148 --> 00:45:55,649
Wolfsbane?

743
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:56,150
Just drink it.

744
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,151
We have to get you
coherent enough

745
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,154
so you can tell me everything
you know about those vampires.

746
00:46:00,154 --> 00:46:02,656
[sighs]

747
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:04,283
You believe me?

748
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:13,531
Open your mouth.

749
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:15,669
You're becoming one of them

750
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,671
We don't have much time,
so drink it.

751
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:20,162
It'll help
slow down the process.

752
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,681
[groans]
Oh!

753
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:29,683
[exhales]

754
00:46:29,683 --> 00:46:32,186
Where the hell are we?

755
00:46:32,186 --> 00:46:33,187
A motel--

756
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:33,687
pretty sleazy one
at that.

757
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:35,689
I couldn't risk
taking you to the house.

758
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:38,192
Captain Billings
might have changed his mind.

759
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:40,694
No one will think
to look for you here,

760
00:46:40,694 --> 00:46:43,697
and no one will care
if you start screaming.

761
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:46,029
Screaming?

762
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:54,196
What's that for?

763
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:59,046
Show me the bite marks
on your neck again.

764
00:46:59,046 --> 00:46:59,546
Why?

765
00:46:59,546 --> 00:47:03,539
Hank, do you trust me?

766
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:07,054
I trust you.

767
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:09,056
Then just do it--

768
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:09,556
and don't watch.

769
00:47:09,556 --> 00:47:13,253
Something tells me
I'mnot going to like this.

770
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:19,066
[sizzling]
[Hank yelling]

771
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:21,568
[yelling continues]

772
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:22,569
Mr. Vincent,

773
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:24,071
you ain't gonna
like this.

774
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:26,573
She's shacked up

775
00:47:26,573 --> 00:47:27,574
in some
fleabag hotel.

776
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:30,577
So it is the guy
from the park.

777
00:47:30,577 --> 00:47:32,579
Yeah, one and the same.

778
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,581
You want I should go in
and take care

779
00:47:34,581 --> 00:47:35,582
of this son of a bitch?

780
00:47:35,582 --> 00:47:36,083
Stay where you are.

781
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:38,085
I'm going
to meet you there.

782
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:39,552
[phone beeps]

783
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,591
smack!
Hank.

784
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:46,115
smack!
Hank!

785
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:48,595
crash!

786
00:47:48,595 --> 00:47:52,599
[groans]
Oh, my neck.

787
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,101
Oh.

788
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:55,102
[sighs]

789
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:56,603
What did you
do that for?

790
00:47:56,603 --> 00:47:57,604
It will help slow down--

791
00:47:57,604 --> 00:48:00,471
Slow down
the process, right.

792
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,111
[glass clinking]

793
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:06,102
Ow.

794
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,621
How's that make you feel?

795
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:15,622
I don't know.

796
00:48:15,622 --> 00:48:16,623
Nauseous.

797
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,625
Good.

798
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,627
Now who doesn't trust who?

799
00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:22,129
It's just a precaution.

800
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:25,632
Look, I need to know everything
you know about those vampires--

801
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:26,633
how many there are,

802
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:27,634
where do they hunt.

803
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:28,635
I don't know.

804
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:30,637
There must have
been a dozen--

805
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:32,139
that I could see anyway.

806
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,640
And they hunt
at these raves.

807
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,641
Raves?

808
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:36,143
These parties
that go all--

809
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:37,144
No, I know
what raves are.

810
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:39,146
I was just thinking
about that

811
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:41,648
beinga great idea
for one of my books.

812
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:43,150
[laughs]
Trust me.

813
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,651
You'll have plenty
to write about

814
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:45,652
if we make it
through this.

815
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:48,155
During the day,
where do they sleep?

816
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:51,158
I don't know.

817
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,660
But I could tell you
where they party at night:

818
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,662
this old,
abandoned hospital

819
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:57,664
downtown.

820
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:58,665
Oh, that's original.

821
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:01,168
Wait till you
see their leader.

822
00:49:01,168 --> 00:49:02,669
He's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

823
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:07,674
I don't know what he is,
but he's definitely not human.

824
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:09,676
It's fascinating.

825
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:12,179
Well, he's the one
who bit you.

826
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:12,679
Yeah.

827
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,182
That's the only reason
you're still alive.

828
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:16,683
If one of the others
had bitten you,

829
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:17,684
you'd been dead on the spot.

830
00:49:17,684 --> 00:49:19,186
I thought they could all,
you know,

831
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:21,188
turn you into one of them
if they wanted to.

832
00:49:21,188 --> 00:49:24,191
No, according to my research,
it has to be the leader.

833
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,193
And even then,
he'll usually kill you

834
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:27,694
unless he chooses you
to join them

835
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:30,197
I don't know
about the choosingpart.

836
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:31,698
What do you mean?

837
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:34,201
When we were struggling,
I knocked the curtain aside,

838
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:37,704
and the sun came in and hit him
in the middle ofbitingme.

839
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:38,705
And now he won't hurt you,

840
00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:41,708
because you're like
one ofhis offspring.

841
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:44,211
He created you.

842
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:45,712
No, he must be very old,

843
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:48,215
perhaps as much
as l,000 years,

844
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:50,717
which means he's much stronger
than the others.

845
00:49:50,717 --> 00:49:53,220
Yeah, they all move
like warp speed.

846
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,222
One second
they're right next to you.

847
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:57,724
The next, they're clear
across the room

848
00:49:57,724 --> 00:49:58,725
Hypnotism

849
00:49:58,725 --> 00:49:59,726
It's a form ofhypnotism

850
00:49:59,726 --> 00:50:02,229
They put their victims
into a trance.

851
00:50:02,229 --> 00:50:03,230
Yeah, with their eyes.

852
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,425
Been there;
done that.

853
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:08,735
What are you doing?

854
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:09,736
So far,
from what you've told me,

855
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:12,239
they've done pretty much
exactly what I'd expect them to.

856
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,742
It'd be my guess they're going
to come lookingfor you.

857
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:17,244
How do you know?

858
00:50:17,244 --> 00:50:18,745
Because the leader
will send them

859
00:50:18,745 --> 00:50:21,248
He'll sense that someone's
helping you fight it,

860
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:23,250
so he'll send
the others to stop me--

861
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,253
which is exactly
what I want him to do.

862
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:27,254
You want them to find us?

863
00:50:27,254 --> 00:50:30,257
Well, they're the only ones that
can tell us where the leader is,

864
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:33,760
which is the only way to save
you from becoming one of them

865
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,262
You have to find
the leader,

866
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:37,264
find where he sleeps
during the day,

867
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:37,764
and kill him

868
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:40,767
Now, there are three things
that vampires don't like:

869
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,269
crucifixes, garlic,
and holy water.

870
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:44,771
But all those things will do
is keep them at bay.

871
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:45,772
If you want to kill them

872
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:47,274
you have to expose them
to sunlight.

873
00:50:47,274 --> 00:50:50,277
Or drive a wooden stake
through their heart.

874
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:52,507
Or cut their heads off.

875
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:57,239
I can't believe we're even
having this conversation.

876
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:01,788
Why are you doing this?

877
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:02,289
What?

878
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:05,792
You've been avoidingme
like the plague

879
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:08,295
for almost a year.

880
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:09,796
Why are you helpingme?

881
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:11,298
Are you kidding?

882
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:12,799
This is the most
incredible thing

883
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:13,800
that's ever happened
to me.

884
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,802
I'mmean, to think
I've been writing

885
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:17,804
about all of this
as fiction,

886
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:18,805
and now to know

887
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:22,309
it actually exists.

888
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:24,311
What's the matter?

889
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:25,812
Nothing.

890
00:51:25,812 --> 00:51:29,316
I just thought that maybe
this was about you and me.

891
00:51:29,316 --> 00:51:33,820
Well, yeah, Hank,
of course.

892
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,321
That too.

893
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:38,758
It's just, I've really
missed you, you know?

894
00:51:41,828 --> 00:51:43,557
[knocking]

895
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:50,861
(Layla)
Can Hank come out and play?

896
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,341
(Susan)
Remember, we don't
want to kill them

897
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:56,343
till they've told us
where their master is.

898
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:59,346
Something tells me that's going
to be easier said than done.

899
00:51:59,346 --> 00:52:02,349
[electric fizzle]
[static]

900
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:04,351
[wind whistling]

901
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:07,445
Wait here.

902
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:14,861
(Layla)
I thought we had something,

903
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:16,863
you and me.

904
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:20,367
And now I catch you
shacking up with Goldilocks.

905
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,369
[sniffs]

906
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:23,870
Ah!

907
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:24,871
Let her go.

908
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:27,874
Oh, isn't that sweet?

909
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:30,377
I think he actually cares
about this little bitch.

910
00:52:30,377 --> 00:52:32,879
Yes, very touching.

911
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:33,880
But I don't think

912
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,180
you're in much of a position
to be making demands here, Hank.

913
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:43,890
Mmm

914
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,892
Yummy.

915
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:46,893
Alex, honey,

916
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:50,522
do you want to do
the honors, or should I?

917
00:52:52,899 --> 00:52:54,901
[both yelling]

918
00:52:54,901 --> 00:52:57,404
Look for a little head
there, Hank?

919
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:57,904
[laughs]

920
00:52:57,904 --> 00:52:58,905
[sword clatters]

921
00:52:58,905 --> 00:52:59,906
Whoa, ooh, Hank.

922
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:01,408
You're gettingstronger,
aren't you?

923
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:04,911
Yeah, it's always the body
that changes first.

924
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:05,912
Don't worry.

925
00:53:05,912 --> 00:53:07,971
The soul
will soon follow.

926
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:13,086
Poppin' fresh.

927
00:53:13,086 --> 00:53:14,588
Isn't this ironic?

928
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:16,089
[laughs]

929
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:18,091
You have made yourself
rich and famous

930
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:22,095
by exploiting us
and glamorizing us.

931
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:23,392
And now...

932
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:28,101
mmm you've ended up
on the menu.

933
00:53:28,101 --> 00:53:29,102
Please, wait, no.

934
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:30,604
You don't understand.

935
00:53:30,604 --> 00:53:32,105
I want to talk to you.

936
00:53:32,105 --> 00:53:33,106
Save some for me.

937
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:34,903
[laughs]

938
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:40,171
crash!

939
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:44,481
Stay.

940
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:45,619
[sizzling]

941
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:47,120
Oh!

942
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,781
I can't see!

943
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:52,125
Huh, now I'mmad.

944
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,627
You've made me soil

945
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:54,628
my favorite shirt.

946
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:55,993
[roaring]

947
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:02,636
Hank!

948
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:04,661
Uh!

949
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:11,941
Bitch.

950
00:54:15,148 --> 00:54:18,242
Hank, we're brothers.

951
00:54:19,653 --> 00:54:20,654
No, Hank, don't look

952
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:22,645
into his eyes.

953
00:54:24,157 --> 00:54:25,522
[groaning]

954
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:28,662
[clamoring]

955
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:29,162
(Susan)
Jake!

956
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:32,165
What the hell
is going on here?

957
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:33,667
Jake, watch out.

958
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,532
[hisses]

959
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,170
Ah!

960
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,569
[crunching]

961
00:54:47,681 --> 00:54:50,377
[gunshots]

962
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:52,686
[roaring]

963
00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:55,314
Ahh!

964
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:58,191
Can't we all
just get along?

965
00:54:58,191 --> 00:55:00,216
[laughs]

966
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:02,696
[shouts]

967
00:55:02,696 --> 00:55:05,688
[sword clatters]

968
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:26,219
splat!

969
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:26,720
[laughs]

970
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,723
Looks like a home run
to me, sports fans.

971
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:31,224
[chuckling]

972
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:32,225
[hisses]

973
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:33,226
[laughs]

974
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,228
Uh!

975
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:37,230
No more games, Hank.

976
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,130
Take a good whiff.

977
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:42,235
It smells heavenly,
doesn't it?

978
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:43,236
[laughs]

979
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:44,237
It smells like--

980
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:45,238
[sniffs deeply]

981
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:47,240
like lilacs
in the spring,

982
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,244
like a T-bone steak
cooked rare over an open flame.

983
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:53,747
That's all you're going
to want fromnow on, Hank.

984
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:56,249
No more standing
in grocery lines

985
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:59,753
with your pitiful
little vegetables.

986
00:55:59,753 --> 00:56:02,756
Look at how much
Layla loves it.

987
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:06,192
[panting]

988
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:10,263
No, Hank, look away.

989
00:56:10,263 --> 00:56:13,664
[growls]

990
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:18,169
The sun's coming up soon.

991
00:56:19,272 --> 00:56:21,274
Our work here is done.

992
00:56:21,274 --> 00:56:23,174
[laughs]

993
00:56:25,278 --> 00:56:27,781
What are we going
to do about her?

994
00:56:27,781 --> 00:56:29,783
She could stay here
with him

995
00:56:29,783 --> 00:56:31,785
wait it out.

996
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:34,788
Be his first meal.

997
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:35,789
[moans]

998
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:36,790
I like it.

999
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,792
[laughs]

1000
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:41,795
There's no turning back
now, Hank.

1001
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:42,796
Another 24 hours,

1002
00:56:42,796 --> 00:56:44,297
and you're one of us.

1003
00:56:44,297 --> 00:56:47,801
You'll know where to find us
when the time comes.

1004
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:48,802
[laughs]

1005
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:50,303
[whooshing]

1006
00:56:50,303 --> 00:56:52,806
slam!

1007
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:55,809
Susan.

1008
00:56:55,809 --> 00:56:57,310
Susan!

1009
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,311
Susan.

1010
00:56:58,311 --> 00:56:58,812
Oh, my God.

1011
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:00,814
(Hank)
Susan, listen to me.

1012
00:57:00,814 --> 00:57:03,316
You've got to go.

1013
00:57:03,316 --> 00:57:04,818
What?

1014
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:05,819
You have to go.

1015
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:07,821
You can't stay here.

1016
00:57:07,821 --> 00:57:09,982
No.

1017
00:57:11,324 --> 00:57:13,827
I can feel it
happening.

1018
00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:15,727
I'm becoming
one of them

1019
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:18,331
You can't be around me.

1020
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:20,333
There's no telling
what I might do.

1021
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:23,063
We can stop it.

1022
00:57:24,337 --> 00:57:25,839
We have to stop it.

1023
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,841
You can't stop it.

1024
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:28,842
It's impossible.

1025
00:57:28,842 --> 00:57:31,845
Not if we find
their master and kill him

1026
00:57:31,845 --> 00:57:33,346
We don't know
where he is.

1027
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:35,348
He could be
anywhere in L.A.

1028
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:35,849
Think.

1029
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:38,351
There must be
something they said.

1030
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,853
What about the hospital?

1031
00:57:39,853 --> 00:57:41,855
No, no, we searched that.

1032
00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:42,856
I'm sure that's it.

1033
00:57:42,856 --> 00:57:46,359
The Master never goes far
fromhis nest.

1034
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:47,360
He'd be much
too conspicuous.

1035
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,363
That's why he has the others
bring him the victims.

1036
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:53,867
He was there
at the hospital.

1037
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,869
That has to be
the nest.

1038
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:57,370
Wait a second.

1039
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:01,374
There's a security guard
during the day,

1040
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:02,876
but not at night.

1041
00:58:02,876 --> 00:58:05,378
They don't need one at night,
just during the day to--

1042
00:58:05,378 --> 00:58:09,883
To keep anyone from discovering
their restingplace.

1043
00:58:09,883 --> 00:58:12,511
[whispers]
Right.

1044
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:17,390
[whispers]
No.

1045
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,790
No, you have to fight it.

1046
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:24,886
Drink this.

1047
00:58:27,901 --> 00:58:29,892
Oh, my God.

1048
00:58:33,907 --> 00:58:35,408
Okay.

1049
00:58:35,408 --> 00:58:36,409
You ready?

1050
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:37,911
Yeah.

1051
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:38,411
I want to stop

1052
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:41,414
at a sportinggoods store
along the way

1053
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:45,043
to pick up some more tools
of the trade.

1054
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:54,427
I don't get it.

1055
00:58:54,427 --> 00:58:56,429
There was only one of them
the other day.

1056
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:58,932
(Susan)
They must have
beefed up security

1057
00:58:58,932 --> 00:59:00,433
after what happened
with you.

1058
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:01,434
(Hank)
Yeah.

1059
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:02,936
But who do they work for?

1060
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:05,438
And do you think they know
who they're guarding?

1061
00:59:05,438 --> 00:59:09,943
There's only one way
to find out.

1062
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:10,944
What are you doing?

1063
00:59:10,944 --> 00:59:12,445
They could be wraiths.

1064
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:13,446
Wraiths?

1065
00:59:13,446 --> 00:59:14,447
What the hell's
a wraith?

1066
00:59:14,447 --> 00:59:15,448
It's sort oflike a demon.

1067
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:16,950
Vampires have
been known to employ them

1068
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:20,954
during the day to guard their
nests in exchange for leftovers.

1069
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:21,955
Leftovers?

1070
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:22,956
You mean like--

1071
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:24,958
Eat human flesh.

1072
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:25,959
Yean, I'm afraid so.

1073
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:28,461
Well, why didn't he
try and kill me yesterday?

1074
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:31,464
Well, he must have
seen your bite marks

1075
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:35,468
and figured that the leader had
chosen you to join the family.

1076
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:35,969
All right.

1077
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:37,470
No, you have
to stay here.

1078
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:38,972
They already know you.

1079
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:41,474
Well, what are you
going to do?

1080
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:41,975
If they're wraiths,

1081
00:59:41,975 --> 00:59:44,978
they won't like crucifixes
any more than vampires do.

1082
00:59:44,978 --> 00:59:48,481
I'mnot so sure
I like this idea.

1083
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:50,483
It's okay.

1084
00:59:50,483 --> 00:59:54,385
I won't get too close.

1085
00:59:56,489 --> 00:59:57,490
Hey.

1086
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,993
Be careful.

1087
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:01,324
I will.

1088
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,002
Excuse me.

1089
01:00:09,002 --> 01:00:09,502
Could you help me?

1090
01:00:09,502 --> 01:00:12,005
My car seems
to have overheated,

1091
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:13,006
and I'm a little bit lost.

1092
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:15,008
Sure, where would
you like to go?

1093
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:16,509
Well, I need to find the--

1094
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:18,011
I can't help you, lady.

1095
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:19,012
Beat it.

1096
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,013
What?

1097
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:21,878
You heard me.

1098
01:00:24,017 --> 01:00:26,519
What seems to be
the problemhere?

1099
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:29,522
This is private property.

1100
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:32,525
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

1101
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:33,526
That is so rude.

1102
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:35,028
Do you have a superior
that I could talk to?

1103
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:39,032
[monstrous voice]
Don't make me tell you again.

1104
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:42,126
Okay.

1105
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:50,043
[door clicks open]

1106
01:00:50,043 --> 01:00:50,543
What's the verdict?

1107
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:53,046
Oh, they're wraiths
all right.

1108
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:56,549
Which means we're gonna have to
kill them if we want to get in.

1109
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:57,050
Afraid so.

1110
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,052
But it's not gonna be easy.

1111
01:00:59,052 --> 01:01:00,053
Why is that?

1112
01:01:00,053 --> 01:01:00,553
Well, supposedly

1113
01:01:00,553 --> 01:01:03,556
they're twice as strong
as a normal person.

1114
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:06,059
And their blood
is poisonous.

1115
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:07,060
Poisonous?

1116
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,561
More like acid, really.

1117
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:11,564
But there is one thing
that might be in our favor.

1118
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:16,569
They don't like heights.

1119
01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:17,831
[sighs]

1120
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:25,078
[suspenseful music]

1121
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:10,748
Come on.

1122
01:02:56,169 --> 01:02:58,160
Hmm

1123
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:04,633
[wet crunching]

1124
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:20,693

[gun clicks]

1130
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:41,547
(man)
You're really
starting to get

1131
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:43,071
on my nerves, lady.

1132
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:58,564
(Hank)
I thought you said
they didn't

1133
01:03:58,564 --> 01:03:59,065
like heights.

1134
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:01,499
I can't know everything.

1135
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:04,798
[sizzling]

1136
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:12,578
Shoot him!

1137
01:04:12,578 --> 01:04:13,579
[gunshot]

1138
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:14,876
clack!

1139
01:04:15,581 --> 01:04:16,843
[spits]

1140
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:24,579
Ahh!

1141
01:04:26,092 --> 01:04:27,855
crash!

1142
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:43,609
(Hank)
It looks like some kind
of a subbasement.

1143
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:46,112
You didn't know
about this before?

1144
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:47,613
No.

1145
01:04:47,613 --> 01:04:48,114
We missed it.

1146
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,616
The security guard
made sure of that.

1147
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:53,119
They must have sealed off
the entrance somehow.

1148
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,850
That's where they sleep.

1149
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:00,626
It's almost sunset.

1150
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:02,628
Are you sure
you're still up for this?

1151
01:05:02,628 --> 01:05:04,130
I can go it alone.

1152
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,631
No.

1153
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:07,633
We're in this
together now.

1154
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:09,225
I'm coming with you.

1155
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:12,729
All right, partners.

1156
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:14,140
click!

1157
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,141
Hey.

1158
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:16,142
What are you doing?

1159
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:17,143
I've already put you
in enough danger.

1160
01:05:17,143 --> 01:05:21,147
I couldn't live with myself
if anything ever happened
to you.

1161
01:05:21,147 --> 01:05:22,148
This isn't fair.

1162
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:27,653
Susan, I know I made
a mess of our marriage.

1163
01:05:27,653 --> 01:05:32,658
No matter what you think,
I've always loved you.

1164
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:33,159
Do me a favor.

1165
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:34,660
Just remember that, okay?

1166
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,163
Hank, don't do this, please.

1167
01:05:37,163 --> 01:05:38,164
You need me.

1168
01:05:38,164 --> 01:05:39,665
Yeah, that's right.

1169
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:41,667
I need you to stay alive.

1170
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,669
I got myself
into this mess.

1171
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:45,432
I can get myself out.

1172
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:48,174
Here.

1173
01:05:48,174 --> 01:05:50,676
If I'mnot out by sundown,
call John.

1174
01:05:50,676 --> 01:05:52,678
Get him over here.

1175
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:53,179
Hank, listen.

1176
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:55,181
Whatever you do,
do not remove the stake

1177
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:56,182
once you've killed him

1178
01:05:56,182 --> 01:05:58,684
He can come back to life
if you do.

1179
01:05:58,684 --> 01:05:59,685
You can only
save yourself.

1180
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:03,189
Killing the leader won't
save the others, only you.

1181
01:06:03,189 --> 01:06:04,190
You'll have to kill
all of them

1182
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:07,693
And once you've killed one,
all bets are off.

1183
01:06:07,693 --> 01:06:10,196
The others won't hesitate
to kill you.

1184
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:14,394
Right.

1185
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:20,706

(Alex)
What can I say?

1208
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:55,434
I'm a light sleeper.

[laughs]

1210
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:57,436
I see you've been busy.

1211
01:12:57,436 --> 01:12:59,938
Nice shirt.

1212
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:02,941
Yeah, you like?

1213
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:04,943
Yeah.

1214
01:13:04,943 --> 01:13:05,444
I really feel

1215
01:13:05,444 --> 01:13:07,446
you could accessorize
a little better, though.

1216
01:13:07,446 --> 01:13:10,949
I got something that would
go really nicely with that.

1217
01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:12,951
Oh, how thoughtful.

1218
01:13:12,951 --> 01:13:15,920
I love gifts.

01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:21,858

to have to kill you.

Uh-oh.

[groans]

1231
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,584
Where is he?

1232
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:28,086
I'll see you
in hell.

1233
01:15:28,086 --> 01:15:32,090
Tell me where he is,
and I'll remove the stake.

01:15:34,593 --> 01:15:36,595
Tell me!

1237
01:15:36,595 --> 01:15:38,222
Where is he?

1238
01:15:43,602 --> 01:15:45,570
He's right behind you.

1239
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,610
(The Master)
You're Hank.

1240
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:54,112
Hank; Hank.

1241
01:15:54,112 --> 01:15:59,641
You've been
a very bad boy.

1242
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:03,622
[laughs]

1243
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:04,623
Susan?

1244
01:16:04,623 --> 01:16:07,125
Isn't he beautiful, Hank?

1245
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:10,629
Susan is part
of the family now.

1246
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:11,129
No.

1247
01:16:11,129 --> 01:16:12,130
Kill me

1248
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,530
and you'll be
killing her.

1249
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:16,635
That's not true.

1250
01:16:16,635 --> 01:16:19,638
If you don't
believe me,

1251
01:16:19,638 --> 01:16:23,141
why don't you ask
the expert?

1252
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:25,143
She's under your spell.

1253
01:16:25,143 --> 01:16:27,646
She'll say
whatever you want her to say.

1254

[magical chime]

1255
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:31,149
Hank?

1256
01:16:31,149 --> 01:16:34,653
Susan, tell
our friend Hank here,

1257
01:16:34,653 --> 01:16:39,157
now that you have
been bitten by me,

1258
01:16:39,157 --> 01:16:43,161
what happens
ifhe kills me.

1259
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:44,663
I'll die too.

1260
01:16:44,663 --> 01:16:46,665
That's not true.

1261
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:48,667
Whoever he has bitten
will die with him

1262
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:50,669
The only one
who will live

1263
01:16:50,669 --> 01:16:53,171
is the one
who kills him

1264
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:53,672
No.

1265
01:16:53,672 --> 01:16:58,677
Interesting little dilemma,
don't you think?

1266
01:16:58,677 --> 01:16:59,177
[laughs]

1267
01:16:59,177 --> 01:17:04,513
Much more entertaining
than me just killing you, hmm?

1268
01:17:09,187 --> 01:17:10,552
Kill him

1269
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,192
How touching.

1270
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:20,699
Now, that is
what I call true love.

1271
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:22,701
Yes, Susan.

1272
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:26,204
Go ahead and kill me,

1273
01:17:26,204 --> 01:17:29,708
and Hank and I
will spend

1274
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:33,211
an eternity in hell
together.

1275
01:17:33,211 --> 01:17:34,576
Kill him

1276
01:17:35,714 --> 01:17:40,218
Or you can just undo
the mess you've done, Hank,

1277
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:45,223
and all of us
can go on living here

1278
01:17:45,223 --> 01:17:49,227
as one big,
happy family.

1279
01:17:49,227 --> 01:17:51,229
Think of it, Hank.

1280
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:57,736
You and Susan
together forever,

1281
01:17:57,736 --> 01:18:01,740
never growing old,

1282
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:10,248
havingpowers beyond
your wildest dreams.

1283
01:18:10,248 --> 01:18:13,251
And all you have to do

1284
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:17,255
is just give in

1285
01:18:17,255 --> 01:18:20,759
and accept your fate.

1286
01:18:20,759 --> 01:18:23,261
Yes, Hank.

1287
01:18:23,261 --> 01:18:25,024
Just give in.

1288
01:18:26,264 --> 01:18:28,494
[demonic wheezing]

1289
01:18:30,268 --> 01:18:32,771
And now he doesn't want
to hurt you,

1290
01:18:32,771 --> 01:18:36,274
because you're like
one ofhis offspring.

1291
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:37,969
He created you.

1292
01:18:39,778 --> 01:18:40,779
No.

1293
01:18:40,779 --> 01:18:44,282
You can't kill me.

1294
01:18:44,282 --> 01:18:46,284
Huh?

1295
01:18:46,284 --> 01:18:47,285
I'm part of you.

1296
01:18:47,285 --> 01:18:51,289
To kill me would be like
killingpart of yourself.

1297
01:18:51,289 --> 01:18:55,293
I am growing wary
of this.

1298
01:18:55,293 --> 01:18:57,818
Susan, kill him

1299
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,304
Susan, do as I say.

1300
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:08,795
Kill him!

1301
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:12,310
Uh!

1302

1304
01:19:22,821 --> 01:19:23,822
Come on.

1305
01:19:23,822 --> 01:19:25,289
Let's go.

1306
01:19:26,324 --> 01:19:29,054
[electricity crackling]

1307
01:19:33,331 --> 01:19:35,231

[yelling continues]

1309
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,361
How did you know?

1310
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:03,862
What?

1311
01:20:03,862 --> 01:20:05,864
How did you know
we'd both survive

1312
01:20:05,864 --> 01:20:07,365
if we pulled the trigger
at the same time?

1313
01:20:07,365 --> 01:20:10,368
We're not going to survive
if we don't hurry up.

1314
01:20:10,368 --> 01:20:11,369
Let's go.

1315
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:12,370
Good-bye, Hank.

1316
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,371
Susan!

1317
01:20:13,371 --> 01:20:16,374
[rumbling continues]

1318
01:20:16,374 --> 01:20:18,877
Susan!

1319
01:20:18,877 --> 01:20:22,244
[crashing]

1320
01:20:33,892 --> 01:20:35,826
[explosion]

1321
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:38,396
Uh!

1322
01:20:38,396 --> 01:20:40,023
[groans]

1323
01:20:58,416 --> 01:20:59,417
Where is she?

1324
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:00,919
What?

1325
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:02,921
Susan.

1326
01:21:02,921 --> 01:21:04,422
What did you do
with her body?

1327
01:21:04,422 --> 01:21:04,923
I told you already.

1328
01:21:04,923 --> 01:21:06,424
Last time I saw her,
she was--

1329
01:21:06,424 --> 01:21:07,926
We spent half the night

1330
01:21:07,926 --> 01:21:10,428
sifting through the rubble
in that basement.

1331
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:12,931
And that's exactly
what we found--

1332
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:14,933
nothing but rubble.

1333
01:21:14,933 --> 01:21:17,936
No, that--that can't be.

1334
01:21:17,936 --> 01:21:19,437
I killed them all.

1335
01:21:19,437 --> 01:21:20,939
The vampires.

1336
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:21,940
Yes, the vampires.

1337
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:26,945
Just like
in Susan's books.

1338
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:30,949
What kind of fuckinggame
are you playing with me?

1339
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:32,951
No game.

1340
01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:36,216
We found these
in your car.

1341
01:21:37,455 --> 01:21:38,456
Yeah, I know.

1342
01:21:38,456 --> 01:21:40,458
We've been
through this already.

1343
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:40,959
The other day

1344
01:21:40,959 --> 01:21:42,460
when Susan and I
were here--

1345
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,461
Wait; wait a minute.

1346
01:21:43,461 --> 01:21:44,963
When Susan and you
were here?

1347
01:21:44,963 --> 01:21:46,965
Yeah,John,
not two days ago.

1348
01:21:46,965 --> 01:21:50,969
I haven't seen hide nor hair
of you in over two days,

1349
01:21:50,969 --> 01:21:52,470
not since I sent
you undercover,

1350
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,973
lookingfor
those missing kids.

1351
01:21:54,973 --> 01:21:57,976
Not since you trashed
the break room

1352
01:21:57,976 --> 01:21:59,477
seeing Susan
on the television.

1353
01:21:59,477 --> 01:22:02,480
Susan reported me
for harassing her.

1354
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,982
Susan was reported missing

1355
01:22:03,982 --> 01:22:04,983
two days ago--

1356
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:07,485
the same time
you were missing.

1357
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:07,986
Now, don't you find

1358
01:22:07,986 --> 01:22:10,488
that an interesting
coincidence, Hank?

1359
01:22:10,488 --> 01:22:11,489
John, that's crazy.

1360
01:22:11,489 --> 01:22:14,993
Susan was here
with you and me two days ago.

1361
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:17,495
You released me
to her custody.

1362
01:22:17,495 --> 01:22:19,497
Released you
to her custody?

1363
01:22:19,497 --> 01:22:22,500
Yes.

1364
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,003
And I suppose
you left here

1365
01:22:25,003 --> 01:22:28,006
and went to a motel
together in Hollywood.

1366
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:29,007
Right.

1367
01:22:29,007 --> 01:22:29,507
How did you know?

1368
01:22:29,507 --> 01:22:32,010
The desk clerk talked
about a guy

1369
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,511
who check in
fitting your description,

1370
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:39,017
and oddly enough, a woman
fitting Susan's description.

1371
01:22:39,017 --> 01:22:42,020
And three hours later,
he finds two dead bodies,

1372
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:46,024
her boyfriend,Jake Vincent,
and the PI that worked for him

1373
01:22:46,024 --> 01:22:51,029
And apparently they were
murdered in your room

1374
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:52,530
Right.

1375
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,531
The vampires

1376
01:22:53,531 --> 01:22:54,532
killed them

1377
01:22:54,532 --> 01:22:57,535
The only fingerprints
in there were yours

1378
01:22:57,535 --> 01:22:58,536
and Susan's.

1379
01:22:58,536 --> 01:23:00,038
That's because vampires

1380
01:23:00,038 --> 01:23:01,539
don't have
fingerprints.

1381
01:23:01,539 --> 01:23:04,531
It says so
in Susan's book.

1382
01:23:08,546 --> 01:23:10,548
Isn't that just
a little convenient, Hank?

1383
01:23:10,548 --> 01:23:13,551
Blame everything
that's happened on vampires?

1384
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:16,554
Come on;
level with me.

1385
01:23:16,554 --> 01:23:18,556
It happens all the time.

1386

Ex-husband goes berserk,
kills the new boyfriend

1387
01:23:23,061 --> 01:23:23,561
and the ex.

1388
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:28,521
John, I'm telling you,
the vampires killed them

1389
01:23:30,068 --> 01:23:33,071
Oh, I get it.

1390
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:35,573
You're going to use
the insanity defense.

1391
01:23:35,573 --> 01:23:38,076
I'mnot insane.

1392
01:23:38,076 --> 01:23:39,077
Right.

1393
01:23:39,077 --> 01:23:41,579
Get him out ofhere.

1394

[slams desk]

1395
01:23:44,582 --> 01:23:46,584
What about my neck?

1396
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:48,051
The bite marks?

1397
01:24:04,602 --> 01:24:07,605
(Dr. Blake)
The bite marks
on your neck were gone.

1398
01:24:07,605 --> 01:24:10,108
So, in a sense,
you were healed.

1399
01:24:10,108 --> 01:24:13,111
Yeah, I guess that's
one way to look at it.

1400
01:24:13,111 --> 01:24:15,613
And why do you suppose
that happened?

1401
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:17,672
Your being healed,
that is.

1402
01:24:19,617 --> 01:24:21,619
Because I killed
that son of a bitch.

1403
01:24:21,619 --> 01:24:23,621
Then if you killed him

1404
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:27,125
how do you think
your wife became a vampire?

1405
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,626
Don't you get it?

1406
01:24:28,626 --> 01:24:30,128
That's why she went back,

1407
01:24:30,128 --> 01:24:32,630
to bring that thing
back to life,

1408
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:33,631
so that he would
bite her again

1409
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:35,633
and she would become
one of them

1410
01:24:35,633 --> 01:24:38,136
A vampire?

1411
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:39,637
So your wife wanted
to become a vampire.

1412
01:24:39,637 --> 01:24:43,641
What the fuck have I been
talking to you about

1413
01:24:43,641 --> 01:24:45,143
for the past hour?

1414
01:24:45,143 --> 01:24:49,147

[electric buzzing]

1416
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:53,014
Okay, well.

1417
01:24:55,653 --> 01:24:58,656
This has all
been very interesting.

1418
01:24:58,656 --> 01:25:01,386
Hey, Doc?

1419
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:06,289
You think I'm crazy?

1420
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:13,671
I think you loved
your wife very much.

1421
01:25:13,671 --> 01:25:17,675
I think your inability
to accept her leaving you

1422
01:25:17,675 --> 01:25:20,678
and startinga relationship
with another man

1423
01:25:20,678 --> 01:25:21,179
compounded with your

1424
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:24,682
alcohol abuse
and lack of sleep

1425
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:27,685
caused you to suffer
a breakdown of some sort

1426
01:25:27,685 --> 01:25:31,189
that manifested itself
into some very--

1427
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:34,692
well, let's just say

1428
01:25:34,692 --> 01:25:38,696
some very destructive
and antisocial behavior.

1429
01:25:38,696 --> 01:25:42,200
''Antisocial behavior''?

1430
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,760

Hmm

01:26:51,936 --> 01:26:54,939
I love what you've done
with the place.

1438
01:26:54,939 --> 01:26:57,874
You're not real.

1439
01:27:00,445 --> 01:27:02,447
It really is
wonderful, Hank,

1440
01:27:02,447 --> 01:27:03,448
being one of them

1441
01:27:03,448 --> 01:27:06,951
You really don't know
what you're missing.

Never growing old.

1447

You're not real.

1448
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:25,470
You going to tell me
that wasn't real?

1449

But Captain Billings--

1450
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:29,974
Didn't remember
anything?

1451
01:27:29,974 --> 01:27:31,476
No one did.

1452
01:27:31,476 --> 01:27:31,976
Naturally.

are far more incredible

than I could have
ever guessed.

01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:38,983
You removed his arrow
to bring him back, didn't you?

You were just
usingme to get to him

1457
01:27:41,486 --> 01:27:43,988
You didn't care
about me.

1458
01:27:43,988 --> 01:27:46,491
You just wanted
to become one of them

1459
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:50,495
You really don't get it,
do you, Hank?

1460
01:27:50,495 --> 01:27:51,496
Look at me.

1461
01:27:51,496 --> 01:27:53,998
I can do
whatever I want.

1462
01:27:53,998 --> 01:27:57,001
I'm going
to live forever.

1463
01:27:57,001 --> 01:27:59,504
It's everything
I ever dreamed about.

1464
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:01,506
I loved you.

1465
01:28:01,506 --> 01:28:03,508
I would have done
anythingfor you.

1466
01:28:03,508 --> 01:28:05,009
Yes, you always were

1467
01:28:05,009 --> 01:28:08,513
the incurable romantic,
weren't you?

1468
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:10,515
[gasps]

1469
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:13,017
That's why
I'mhere, Hank,

1470
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:14,018
because you love me.

1471
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:16,020
Because you're
stubborn and obsessive.

1472
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,522
And I knew if you
ever got out ofhere,

1473
01:28:17,522 --> 01:28:22,892
you'd never give up
until you found me again.

1474

How's that
for romantic?

1480
01:28:49,053 --> 01:28:53,456

[retching]

1482
01:29:03,735 --> 01:29:06,533
Consider this
a divorce.

1483
01:29:23,254 --> 01:29:23,755
[sighs]

1484
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:28,259
I think we may have
a breakthrough.

1485
01:29:28,259 --> 01:29:30,261
He's finally come to terms
with the breakup.

1486
01:29:30,261 --> 01:29:33,264
He may now even be able to put
the obsession with his wife

1487
01:29:33,264 --> 01:29:36,768
behind him altogether.

1488
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,770
Will he tell us
where the body is?

1489
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:39,771
That's the question.

1490
01:29:39,771 --> 01:29:40,772
Perhaps.

1491
01:29:40,772 --> 01:29:44,776
He's going to need sedating
after such a cathartic episode.

1492
01:29:44,776 --> 01:29:46,778
Did you see that?

1493
01:29:46,778 --> 01:29:49,280
Administer two CCs
ofhexachloride.

1494
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,282
Wait a second.

1495
01:29:51,282 --> 01:29:53,284
I told you
she would come.

1496
01:29:53,284 --> 01:29:55,787
I want to talk
to him first.

1497
01:29:55,787 --> 01:29:57,288
[electric flicker]

01:29:57,288 --> 01:29:58,289
[door clicks]

1499
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:00,792
Hi, Hank.

1500
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:02,293
Did you see that?

1501
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:04,796
She came for me,John,

1502
01:30:04,796 --> 01:30:08,061
just like I knew
she would.

1503
01:30:09,801 --> 01:30:10,802
What do you think?

1504
01:30:10,802 --> 01:30:11,803
Is it time?

1505
01:30:11,803 --> 01:30:13,304
What?

1506
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:15,306
To tell me
where the body is.

1507
01:30:15,306 --> 01:30:16,808
She's right over there,

1508
01:30:16,808 --> 01:30:19,038
where the...

1509
01:30:32,824 --> 01:30:34,325
But you were
watching, right?

1510
01:30:34,325 --> 01:30:35,827
From the other room?

1511
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:36,828
You saw it all

1512
01:30:36,828 --> 01:30:38,329
on the video camera.

1513
01:30:38,329 --> 01:30:39,330
Huh.

1514
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,833
Oh, of course.

1515
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,334
You couldn't
see her,

1516
01:30:43,334 --> 01:30:45,837
because vampires
can't be photographed.

1517
01:30:45,837 --> 01:30:47,839
John--hey, wait;
no,John.

1518
01:30:47,839 --> 01:30:49,329
John--

Sooner or later, Hank;

1520
01:31:00,852 --> 01:31:04,481
sooner or later.

1521
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:13,728
Does this
look familiar?

1522
01:31:14,866 --> 01:31:16,925
No.

1523
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:20,371
Did he have
any visitors?

1524
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:21,873
Civilians?

1525
01:31:21,873 --> 01:31:22,874
No.

1526
01:31:22,874 --> 01:31:25,877
Only you and me.

1527
01:31:25,877 --> 01:31:28,880
Maybe it's one
of the nurses'.

1528
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,381
There are no
female nurses

1529
01:31:30,381 --> 01:31:31,883
on this floor.

1530
01:31:31,883 --> 01:31:33,214
No?

Ahh.

1536
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:55,633
Can you imagine me

1537
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:59,637
as a thorn
in your side?

1538
01:32:59,637 --> 01:33:02,640
Where would
the pleasure be

1539

if it always
felt right?

1540
01:33:06,644 --> 01:33:09,647
You'd be
as good as dead

01:33:09,647 --> 01:33:14,652

your guard,

Watch me
with your eyes,

1546
01:33:53,691 --> 01:33:57,194

your fears.

Ooh.
