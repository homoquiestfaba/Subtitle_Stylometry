2
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,159
I think we're almost there, guys, I think. 

3
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,837
I just talked to the venue. They say it's totally sold out. 

4
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:14,395
Almost.

5
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,506
Any hot pockets left?

6
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:24,006
God. 

7
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,544
It's going to be great, man. Cheer up. 

8
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:32,689
- My landlord's been calling me.                                                                   
- Yeah?

9
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:36,088
I can't wait anymore. I need to borrow some money.

10
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,931
- I can't give you more money. 
 - I'm not asking you to give it to me. 

11
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,493
I'm going to borrow it. I'm going to pay you back. 
 Fine, I'm going to fix it. 

12
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,330
Oh, come on, mom. 
Do you have to do that here, really?

13
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,501
Where else am I going to do it? 
 Janie, go get $10 out of my purse, okay?

14
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:17,968
Pay for the gas. 

15
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,095
I really don't see why you have to look like a hooker to introduce me. 

16
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:45,528
God!

17
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,729
I don't look like a hooker. 

18
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:55,039
I just haven't seen Ethan in a really long time and I really wanted to just look nice for him. 

19
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,180
That's all. 

20
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,463
[singing] Ladies are in the house

21
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:31,939
[all singing] Ladies of the eighties are in my blouse!

22
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,403
Hello, Little Rock!

23
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,681
Okay. What?

24
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,360
- What the hell is going on? 
 - Someone is here to see Ethan. 

25
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,930
- No one is allowed to see the band before the show, you know that. 

26
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,094
- It's not a fan. 
 -What do you mean? Spit it out! 

27
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:04,639
Shit.

28
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:16,621
- What's going on? 
 - Seriously. We need to talk in private. 

29
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:21,359
Seriously, no. I don't want to. Because every time you say, 'Let's talk in private'

30
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:25,887
it's some kind of shitstorm and I want to ride this one out with the boys. 

31
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,029
And with Iris.

32
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,935
- Spill it. 
 - Give me two minutes, okay?

33
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,310
It's either going to be bad news about me or it's going to be bad news about the band. 

34
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,813
- Either way, we're a family. 
 - That's really nice of you to say. 

35
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:44,577
- Except for Billy. 
 - Beautiful, beautiful. 

36
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,809
One, two, three.

37
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:51,721
Okay, but I'm on record: I tried. 

38
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,652
Someone is in a bad mood today.

39
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,395
- Hello 
 -Hi. 

40
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:05,764
Who is this?

41
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:14,001
What can we do for you, lady?

42
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,874
Ethan, it's Mary Ann. 

43
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,212
Shit!

44
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:26,750
Oh, my God. I can't believe you don't recognize me. 

45
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:32,894
I guess it's been a few years maybe. 
 Oh, my God. It's been 13 years. 

46
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:37,130
It's Mary Ann Jones! God!

47
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:39,737
Do you remember we hung out when you were touring? 
 That's great. 

48
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:41,227
I don't...

49
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:46,544
- I don't really remember you. 
 - Can I just talk to you?

50
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:52,312
- For five minutes, by yourself? 
 - Everyone wants your time, man! 

51
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:57,112
-Shut up. 
 - No! Sorry.

52
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:02,019
-Let's talk about it here because we're a family. 

53
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:05,830
We are a family and this is my girlfriend.

54
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,299
We go on in five minutes so what do you want?

55
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,494
I think I should talk to you in private. 

56
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,801
No, I don't think so. 

57
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,271
- You got the stage. 
 - Okay. 

58
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,451
Okay, I don't know how to say this so I'll just say it. 

59
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,419
Ethan, you have a daughter.

60
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,089
She is 13 years old.
Her name is Jane.

61
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,937
But a lot of people call her Janie. 
 Her name is Janie Jones.

62
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:48,337
- Like the song by The Clash.
- Shut up, man.

63
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,269
Okay. I don't...

64
00:07:56,981 --> 00:08:00,917
- Sorry, what is your name again? 
 - My name is Mary Ann. 

65
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,947
Mary Ann...

66
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,724
What do you want?

67
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,489
Money?

68
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:18,536
Because don't let the bus fool you, I ain't got shit. 

69
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:21,198
I don't want your money. I need help. 

70
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:24,134
I have to get myself cleaned up and I need

71
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:28,411
I need somebody to take care of her because I can't. 

72
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:32,375
What, are you buying this?

73
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:45,263
Look, lady, I'm sure the shit has really hit the fan in your life. 

74
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:50,166
But don't you think this is just a tiny bit manipulative to come in here and play 

75
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:53,334
'pin the tail on the daddy' with me?

76
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,007
Oh, God. I don't know what I was thinking. 

77
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:07,276
Okay, guys. Five minutes.

78
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:14,682
What, you believe her?

79
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:19,121
I don't have a kid!

80
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:22,594
I've never even met this woman. 

81
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:26,359
The jury is still out, man. 

82
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,141
- How are you doing, sweetie? 
 - I'm good, thanks. 

83
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:37,178
- Want another soda? 
 - No, thank you. I'm all right. 

84
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,454
- Hey, did you talk to him? I did. 
 - What did he say?

85
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:46,252
- He is so excited to see you. 
 - Really?

86
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,094
Hey, mom, you want to go upfront? 
I can't see.

87
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:00,404
I'm going to wait back here. 
You go. 

88
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,998
- Are you sure? 
 - Yeah, totally! Go, go!

Mom?

101
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,698
911, emergency. 

102
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:36,601
- I saw your kid in the front row. 
 - She has his eyes. 

103
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,135
- Shut the fuck up, she's not my kid. 

104
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:40,865
- I don't have a kid. 
 - What, what'd I say?

105
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,739
Was that necessary?

106
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:54,717
Thanks, dude. 

107
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,802
Technically, she could be your kid, man. 

108
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:21,939
Technically, she could be anyone's kid. 

109
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:25,049
- But she bears a striking resemblance. 
 - What?

110
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,317
- What?
- What?

111
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,486
- What?
- Say what?

112
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,321
- Did you say something? 
 - I did not. 

113
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:31,345
No.

114
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:34,186
- This is funny. 
 - Have fun with this. 

115
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,449
It's fucking hilarious. 

116
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,231
Oh, don't go away mad. 

117
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,472
Is that him in the black jacket and tie?

118
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,235
- Yeah. 
 - All right. 

119
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,235
How y'all doing?

120
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,112
Which one of y'all is Ethan?

121
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:05,945
- That's me. 
 - Mind if I have a word with you in private?

122
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,095
- I don't remember meeting this woman. 
 I'm supposed to believe that this is...

123
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,764
This is my kid?

124
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:20,468
- I don't buy it. 
 - If you ask me, she takes after you quite a bit. 

125
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:26,875
- Now, how well did you know the mother? 
 That's legit, by the way. 

126
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,682
I think she came on tour with us for a bit. 

127
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:41,552
- It was a long time ago, man. 
 I barely knew her. 

128
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,854
You're going to make this difficult, ain't you?

129
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:49,558
- This is crazy man. 
 It seems to me, seeing that...

130
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:53,803
- You <i>are</i> the father. 
 She ought to go with you. 

131
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:57,942
- We're on tour. 
 This is no life for a little girl. 

132
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:01,139
Normally, I'd agree with you. 
 But here is the deal. 

133
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,975
 I called this in. The mother is nowhere to be found. 

134
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,119
Her home phone, her cell phone has been shut down. 

135
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:11,021
I ran her record. Recent arrests, possession. 

136
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:15,117
A good sized stash of methamphetamine.
 Missed her court date, got a warrant on her. 

137
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,691
Now...

138
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:22,299
She may turn up and she may sort all that out. 

139
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,392
I mean, God, let's hope so. Right?

140
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:28,072
But all<i> that</i> ain't real good for this little girl. 

141
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:31,269
She must have other family. 

142
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:35,845
Girl said she doesn't know any other relatives that are alive. 
 We'll check it out. 

143
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:38,549
Hi Is everything okay?

144
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,085
I was just telling your friend, I'm sorry, what is your name?

145
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:42,653
- Iris. 
 - Iris. 

146
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,621
- Beautiful name.
- Thank you.

147
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:49,624
Iris, I was just telling your friend, Ethan, that we have ourselves a situation. 

148
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:53,187
- What's that? 
 - Look. 

149
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:58,628
- I don't think that she is my kid. 
 - If you don't take her...

150
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:03,073
- I have to call family services then she goes in to state care. 

151
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,735
Until they place her in some foster home. 

152
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:11,046
And then, there's you. 
Your name is on that birth certificate. 

153
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:14,207
- You have a kid? 
 - No, no. 

154
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:19,924
- I don't have a kid. 
 - If I have to call this in right now...

155
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:24,418
- Y'all ain't going nowhere. 
 You'll stay here, in town, until the hearing. 

156
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:27,691
And if the court orders a paternity suit, which they <i>will</i>

157
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:31,266
And it's <i>you.</i> 
 You got problems. 

158
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:34,772
Deadbeat dad. 

159
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,003
It's a big shock, I know. 

160
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:47,251
- This is not happening.
- Ethan, you're not thinking about not taking her? 

161
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:50,448
No, I'm thinking about what's best for the kid. 

162
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:09,804
- I don't think I can do this. 
 - Okay but you <i>do</i> have a choice. 

163
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:15,212
You ain't gotta go with him. 
 I can bring in the folks from Family Services. 

164
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:17,180
But I ain't sure you're going to like that. 

165
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,148
So let's just say 'hi' to the fella. 

166
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,886
And if you change your mind, I'm going to be right there. 

167
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:26,990
Is that okay?

168
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,853
- Yeah, okay. 
 - Okay. 

169
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:42,995
Let's give them a minute. 

170
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,005
Jane Jones, this is Ethan.
Ethan, this is Jane.

171
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,450
- Hey. 
 - Hey. 

172
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,230
So I guess your mother took off?

173
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:16,336
Aw, man. 

174
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,212
[profanity] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. 

175

It came out. 

176
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,852
- Do you play? 
 - Yeah. 

177
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:44,258
- How long? 
 - I don't know, a couple years, I guess. 

178
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,309
Well...

179
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:01,843
Look, I know this is kind of a weird deal 
 but why don't you just come with us?

180
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:07,155
Until your mom calls, shows up or whatever?

181
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:14,021
Yeah, okay. 

182
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,959
You ever been on a tour bus before?

183
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,237
Well...

184
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:25,666
This one sucks. 

185
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:49,325
- Hi, I'm Iris.
- Hi.

186
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,261
You want a tour of the bus?

187
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,464
No, I'm okay, thanks. 

188
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:03,571
Guys, there's a kid on the bus. 

189
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,073
Sorry, man, but what the hell are we supposed to do?

190
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:10,312
- Not get high? 
 - Billy, don't put that out. 

191
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:23,094
Dude, this is so [profanity]

192
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:26,869
You can't have a kid on tour with us. 

193
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,642
It's bad luck. It's like having a woman on a ship. 

194
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:35,373
- She's not a woman, she's a kid. 
 - Iris is a woman. 

195
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:39,205
- So, what's your point? 
 - And this isn't a ship. 

196
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,875
Okay fine, then it's good luck. 

197
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:46,623
- Gil, open the window. 
 - It's jammed.

Hey. 

200
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,097
I have someone here who wants to meet the rest of the band. 

201
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,705
- This is Chuck, he is our drummer. 
 - Janie Jones, I like your name. 

202
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:07,335
- Hi, Chuck.
- This is Dave, he plays bass. 

203
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:14,084
- Hey, how are you doing? 
 - This is Billy, our lead guitar player. 

204
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:17,884
- He used to tour with Ashley Simpson. 
 - Hi. 

205
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:24,721
- All right, maybe we should hang out in the front lounge for a little bit. 
 - Yeah. 

206
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:24,588
Why are you shaking me over this? 
 It's only for a few more days. 

207

That's not the point. 

208
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:28,992
- Yeah. 
 - Oh, really?

209
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:32,162
I don't know why I'm the bad guy. 
 I'm just trying to do the right thing. 

210
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:35,465
- Oh, come on. That's bullshit. 
 - Whatever! It was a long time ago!

211
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:37,456
She's probably some junkie tramp.

- [profanity] 
 - What?

213

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,120
That''s fucking hilarious. Fuck you. 

331
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,135
Asshole.

332
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,986
Come on, let's do this later. 

333
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:06,089
No, we're not going to do this later! 
 We're going to do this now!

334
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,160
- Wake up. 
 - What the fuck?

335
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:10,385
What the fuck are you doing?

336
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:15,632
- Where are we? 
 - We just arrived in 'Doucheville'. 

337
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:18,692
- This is your stop. 
 - No, seriously. Where are we?

338
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:22,438
Philosophically speaking, I'd say we've arrived at a crossroads. 

339
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:27,603
- The label dropped the band.
- They killed the tour, man.

340
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:31,211
What?

341
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:37,520
- What are you talking about? Why?
- Why? Dave, want to take this one?

342
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,223
No. Let me. 
 'Why did they kill the tour?'

343
00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:44,460
Let me see if I can't recreate their decision. 

344
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,766
Upon viewing the youtube video of you starting a rob room brawl on stage, 

345
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:53,369
and then walking out on your remaining 2,000 fans, 
 powers that be got together 

346
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:56,406
and said, "Wait a minute, this guy is actually ridiculous!"

347
00:33:56,406 --> 00:34:01,377
And also, there is no more margin in this business because 
 these idiots don't sell albums anymore!

348
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:05,982
While that bullshit might play for Radiohead, throwing good money

349
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:09,586
at this used up has-been is probably not such a good idea!

350
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:12,355
And also, it's just fucking plain embarrassing! 

351
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:16,689
All those in favor of dropping the Ethan Brand Experiment?

352
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:18,261
Fuck.

353
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:21,030
This bus is going back to New York tonight. 

354
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,126
So we can either hitch a ride or we can continue the tour on our own. 

355
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,703
What do you say?

356
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,500
- Where is Iris?

357
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,480
Are you fucking joking?

358
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,071
- She went back to L.A, man. 
 - Continue sleeping. 

359
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:00,564
No problem.

360
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,263
Do you need anything?

361
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,258
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes

362
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:09,735
Okay.

363
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:20,649
I have to talk with Sloan
about some business stuff. 

364
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:22,579
Okay.

365
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,790
- Hang out. 
 - Yeah. 

366
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:39,259
- Watch TV.
- Right.

367
00:36:42,004 --> 00:36:43,665
I'll be back.

368
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:15,168
Just let me work on them, all right?

369
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:18,508
Because they know you just lost part of your band. 

370
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:22,501
You got dropped and now this thing with Youtube. 

371
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:26,373
It's not being very helpful to this situation. 

372
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,347
- Play it again. 
 - What?

373
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:32,554
- Just play it! 
 - I'm not playing it again!

374
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:35,658
- You're going to freak out. 
 - I'm not going to freak out. 

375
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:38,718
- Yes, you are. 
 - I'm not going to freak out, I promise. 

376
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,328
All right. No yelling. 

377
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:47,696
I am not. 

378
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:51,137
[over speakers] But not enough to deal with the fucking consequences?

379
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:57,736
Stop! Stop!
Chuck, help me out here.

380
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,260
Fuck!

381
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,080
I thought we had a deal, man. 

382
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,580
I look like a fucking dickhead. 

383
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,940
Just don't let them cancel SXSW. (South by Southwest) 

384
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:13,620
What?

385
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,390
- We need that frickin' gate. 
 - Yeah, we need it. 

386
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,700
Okay, okay. Yeah. 

387
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:25,233
Relax.

388
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:28,103
What are we going to do about her?

389
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:32,077
She's gotta go, man!

390
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,850
Back to her mom. 

391
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,115
She's a kid, I can't be responsible for her. 

392
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,682
She can't hear me!

393
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:45,126
All right. 

394
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,521
Where you going?

395
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,700
I need some air.

What are you doing messing with ancient folk songs?

415

- What do you mean? 
 - I mean, that song is like a hundred years old. 

416
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:02,558
Shouldn't you be listening to Jonas Brothers or Miley Cyrus or some shit like that?

 - They said they were going to go talk some shop.

I'm tired of getting hit in the back of the neck with shit pellets.

are loading up the van and heading back to New York?

 - Yeah.

00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,163
- Officer Dickerson? 
 - That's me. 

502
00:49:21,163 --> 00:49:24,633
It's Ethan Brand. We met last week with that little girl?

503
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:27,569
I was wondering if you managed to track down her mom yet?

504
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:31,240
- Sorry, not a thing. 
 - Well, I don't get it. 

505
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,435
She said that she was going into rehab. 

506
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:38,637
Yep, well that's what junkies say. 
 Everything okay?

507
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:47,122
- I don't think that I'm the best person for this. 
 - At the moment? You're the only person for it. 

508
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:49,454
I got to go.
I'll call you back. 

509
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:54,789
- Who was that?
- Some record label idiots.

We have to hit it. 

511
00:49:58,267 --> 00:50:01,470
We have to be at the venue by 8. 
 We still got to find a place to crash. 

512
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,698
Thank you.

515
00:50:57,025 --> 00:51:00,017

 - Seventeen.

Really? 
 Which one?

517
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,020
-That one. 
 - Who's that?

518
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,500
I got it out of a book.

519
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:13,634
Some hottie I saw a picture of. 
I got that first one just to see my mom freak.

00:51:14,142 --> 00:51:15,575
What did she do?

521
00:51:17,212 --> 00:51:20,147
- She freaked! 
 - Did she ground you?

522
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:22,818
- No.
- What? No punishment?

523
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:26,521
Not unless you call a lifetime of 
resentment and psychotherapy punishment. 

524
00:51:26,521 --> 00:51:30,292
She was so disgusted with me, 
 she went to Italy with her boyfriend the next day. 

525
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:34,096

 - Yeah, seriously.

 - No, you just play the G and the C.

- Hi 
 - Hey, Janie. 

665
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,751
Girls, this is Janie Jones.

666
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,857
- Hey, Janie. 
 - Hi. 

667
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:46,590
Aren't you a little young to be in here?

668
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,589
Aren't you a little old to be wearing white?

669
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:52,963
She's feisty, I like her. 

670
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:59,839
The Janie is very talented. 
 She'll play a couple of songs with me tonight. 

671
01:04:00,808 --> 01:04:03,444
Couldn't find any backup singers your own age?

672
01:04:03,444 --> 01:04:06,106
Yeah, I'm actually not a backup singer. 
 He's my dad. 

673
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:16,589
Go in and check on our gear and stuff. 
 I'll be over there in a second. 

674
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:25,960
She's not really my kid. 

675
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:31,105
This is my cell.
 Give me a buzz after the show. 

676
01:04:31,105 --> 01:04:32,197
Nice to meet you.

677
01:04:33,074 --> 01:04:34,405
Have a good night. 

678
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:35,976
I hope you enjoy the show.

679
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:53,828
- Thanks.
 - You know, I don't see why you have to drink so much.

 - They weren't cougars.

01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:02,969
Yes, they were. 

684
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:05,503

685
01:05:10,678 --> 01:05:13,545

She is very talented. 
 She's going to sing a couple of songs with me.

Her name is Janie Jones.

She's like that girl, what's the name of that girl you were talking about? 

699
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:41,232

711

Call Sloan.
He'll take care of it.

01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:13,219
Oh, God. I can't do it.

- I wanna make my phone call. 
 - You already had your phone call. 

716
01:08:40,087 --> 01:08:43,250
Yeah, but it went to voicemail and it really doesn't count. 

717
01:09:13,054 --> 01:09:18,822
[deepened voice] Hi, my friend was arrested tonight and I would like to bail him out. 

718
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,960

719

Strip.

720
01:09:41,882 --> 01:09:44,819
Oh, man. Can't I just keep my clothes on, please?

721
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:48,220
"Man?" What, you have an attitude problem?

722
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:55,086
- You have an attitude problem? 
 - No. 

723
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:57,721
Strip. 

724
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:09,102
Sloane, it's Janie Jones and I really need your help.

725
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:13,981
Ethan got himself arrested and I need to bail him out. 

726
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:17,485
I really need you to call me because I don't know what to do. 

727
01:10:17,485 --> 01:10:20,020
Please call me. 
 I'm at a hotel right now. 

728
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,925
It's 508-555-0755.

729
01:10:24,925 --> 01:10:28,656
Room 20. Please, please call. 
Thanks, bye.

730
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,804
Sloan!

731
01:10:48,048 --> 01:10:50,539
Sorry. Sorry. No.

732
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:52,785
Five hundred dollars?

733
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:57,315
No, no. That's not a problem at all. 

734
01:10:58,425 --> 01:10:59,619
Yeah. 

735
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:03,054
9 AM? 
 Okay. 

736
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:05,722
Okay, I'll be there. 
 Bye. 

737
01:13:09,356 --> 01:13:13,122
- May I help you, little lady?
- I spoke with someone last night named Gil?

738
01:13:13,961 --> 01:13:17,556
My friend Ethan Brand was arrested and I'm here to bail him out. 

739
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:20,664
You should take a seat. 
 We'll get into some paperwork.

740
01:13:21,035 --> 01:13:24,471
Is that going to take a long time? 
 He's been in there all night. 

741
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:28,802
- I sort of want to get him out. 
 - Well, that depends on how fast you can write. 

742
01:14:42,873 --> 01:14:44,397
I'm sorry. 

743
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,000
I was so scared they might hurt you in there. 

744
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,160
I'm okay. 

745
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,940
I didn't know what to do so I called Sloane but he didn't answer. 

746
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,960
- Yeah, I know. 
 - So, I pawned your guitars. 

747
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,200
- What?
- Well, don't get mad at me. 

748
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,220
- I'm friggin' 13, there's not a lot of options. 
 - Yeah, I know, I know. 

749
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:15,700
- Plus, you owe like $100 and $60 for the motel room. 
 - I know, I know. 

750
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,420
You rock. 

751
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,280
Let's get the hell out of here. 

752
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:38,200
- How did you get here, did you take a taxi? 
 - What? No way, I drove our car. 

753
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,680
- You've been driving? 
 - Yeah! And I'm totally good at it now too. 

754
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,520
At first, I was scared.

755
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,280
Okay, okay. I appreciate your initiative and the candy spirit

756
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,840
but the driving thing has to end now. 

757
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,340
- No, I'm good! I'm really good! 
 - Give me the keys!

758
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,440
- Come on. 
 - Keys! Non-negotiable! 

759
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,600
It's ridiculous, fine. 

760
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:03,740
How the hell did you figure out how to get me out of there?

761
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,160
Well, I mean, I guess I'd have to give credit to my mom for getting in so much trouble with the law. 

762
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:12,000
- And with Duane "Dog" Chapman.
- Who's that?

763
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:17,960
Bounty hunter? 
 It's a reality show on A&E. 

764
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,630
- It's so cool, no? 
 - Okay. 

765
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,720
Okay, let's have the bad news. 
 How much to get my gear out? 

766
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:35,300
Look, it's not like I tried to get you a better deal. 
 The guy was just so...

767
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,900
- What's the damage? 
 - A thousand bucks to get the guitars back. 

768
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,190
Sorry.

769
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:41,560
It's not your fault. 
Sorry.

770
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,658
It's not your fault. 

771
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,420
I'm the drunken lout.

772
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,780
I'm going to deal with this. 

773
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,860
- What are you going to do? 
 - I'm going to call Sloane. 

774
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:58,880
- Where's my phone?
- I don't know. 

775
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,720
What do you mean you don't know? 
 It was with my stuff in the green room. 

776
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,520
No, it wasn't I got everything out of the green room. 
 - You looked in my bag?

777
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,760
- Yup, many times. 
 - In the cases?

778
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,500
Shit. 

779
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,260
You know what you remind me of, guys?

780
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:18,840
Hold on a minute, I've got to take this. 

781
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,060
Hello?

782
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,330
Yeah, I'll accept the charges. 

783
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:30,040
Hey, hey. Ethan? 
 How are you...what?

784
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,900
What are you talking about? 
 What message?

785
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,500
- I never got a fucking message, man. 
 - I was in fucking jail, Sloane. 

786
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,620
Jail! With steel bars. 

787
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,560
and evil fucking people who steal shit and murder people

788
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,500
You know who bailed me out? 
 Not you!

789
01:17:41,651 --> 01:17:44,621
Not my manager and my friend who, by the way, didn't pick up the phone!

790
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:47,491
Do you know who did it? 
 Janie did it, Sloane. 

791
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:50,980
Janie Jones. She hocked my guitars to get me out of jail. 

792
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,900
Wow, wow. 

793
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,260
Yeah...'wow!' 

794
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,240
So now, I've got no gear and almost no money. 
 - So...

795
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:07,920
- I need you to wire me some cash. 
 - I can't, man. 

796
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,940
- It's just two grand. 
 - I can't. I don't have it. 

797
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:16,440
- Of course, you do. 
 - No, I don't have it, man. 

798
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,340
Okay, a thousand. 

799
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,160
I don't have it. 
 I'm serious!

800
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,840
That is bullshit! 
 You can't spare a thousand dollars?

801
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,880
Even if I had the money, I can't bail you out!

802
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:33,920
Okay? I'm sorry, I'm tapped out, man. 

803
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,900
All right, whatver. 
 Don't worry about it. 

804
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,940
Chicago! Oh, my God! 
 That's crazy, I've been waiting to go to a big city for ever!

805
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,080
Don't get too excited because we're not going to stay very long. 

806
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,820
We're just going long enough to pick up some money. 

807
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:58,600
then we got to turn around and pick up our gear then we got four days to get by SXSW. 

808
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,280
What? That's crazy. 

809
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,300
Can you just get the person that's going to give us the money to wire it?

810
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,940
- No, I can't. 
 - Why not?

811
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,480
It's complicated.

812
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,320
Just wait here, I'll be back in a minute. 

813
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,940
Ethan?

814
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,640
Lily, I need to talk to you.

815
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,900
I need your help. 
 My back is against the wall. 

816
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,420
Oh, my God. 

817
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,020
Are you serious?

818
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,840
You're a grown man, Ethan. 

819

820
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,960
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't serious. 

821
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,740
I need a small loan.

822
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,040
- That's all. 
 - That's all?

823
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,240
I'm playing bridge. 

824
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,640
2,000. It's all I need. 
 You guys, your change purse!

825
01:22:02,879 --> 01:22:05,973
What would you do if you didn't have me to turn to?

826
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,980
You'd have to get a job, now wouldn't you?

827
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,580
Oh, that's funny. 
 Coming from woman who's never worked a day in her life!

828
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,900
I think we're done here, Ethan. 

829
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,360
I will not have my character assassinated
inside my own house.

830
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:23,720
It's not for me. 
 It's for my daughter. 

831
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,740
Oh, Ethan. 

832
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,360
This is a new low, even for you! 

833
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,020
Lying about a child to extort money from your mother?

834
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,580
I'm not lying. 

835
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:44,300
- She's sitting outside right now. 
 - Oh, really?

836
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,340
Yeah, really.

837
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:49,320
Well, don't be rude. 

838
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:53,060
By all means, bring her in. 
 I would love to meet my granddaughter. 

839
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,880
You can meet her another day. 

840
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,440
- Goodbye, Ethan. 
 - Okay!

841
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,460
Okay. Fine. 

842
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,740
Well, this should be amusing. 

843
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:35,260
Lily, this is Janie. 

844
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,980
She's your granddaughter. 

845
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,040
Hello, Janie.

846
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:43,280
Hi. 

847
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,860
Ethan, you've got to stop this charade. 
 I mean, really. 

848
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,580
The two of you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. 

849
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,440
- How old are you, young lady? 
 - I'm thirteen. 

850
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:56,780
- Thirteen? 
 - Yeah. 

851
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:00,340
- And he is your father?
- Yeah. 

852
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,080
Ethan, where did you find this child? 
 On the street?

853
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,340
It's one thing to waste your own life chasing this music career 

854
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,820
But to come in here and demand money from me while you're corrupting this innocent child...

855
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,900
Stop! Stop!
  Okay? Just stop!

856
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,460
Okay? And...

857
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,300
And he's not lying, okay?

858
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,860
He's...

859
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,940
I'm her father.

860
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,120
I'm her father.

861
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,020
- Come on, let's go. 
 - Wait. 

862
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,080
Please, wait. 
 Please, close the door. 

863
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,060
I'm sorry. 

864
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,520
I shouldn't have brought you here. 

865
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,460
So...

866
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,120
That's your mom?

867
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,840
Yeah. 

868
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,340
I thought I had it bad. 

869
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,960
Yeah. 

870
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,640
I'm sorry, my dear. 

871
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:40,420
I wish I could say that I forgot my medication but there is really no excuse for my behavior. 

872
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:06,280
She has your father's eyes. 

873
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,800
So, where are you going?

874
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,980
We gotta get back on the road. 

875
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,160
Can't you stay for just a little bit?

876
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,220
No, we really got to get going. 

877
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:39,020
- So where are you headed? 
 - Texas. 

878
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,560
- Hey, Ethan. 
 - Yeah?

879
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,500
- Can I ask you a question? 
 - Yeah?

880
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:53,360
Okay. But you have to promise that you'll tell me the truth. 

881
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:57,600
- Seriously, like really. 
 - Okay, yeah. 

882
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:04,740
Was my mom just some groupe that you hooked up with?

883
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,820
No. Not at all. 
 I totally dugged your mom. 

884
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,580
She was...

885
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,900
She was cool.

886
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,600
- Yeah, okay. 
 - She was, I'm serious. 

887
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:28,860
What happened to your father?
You, like, never talk about him. 

888
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,800
- If you don't want to talk about it... 
 - No, it's cool. 

889
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:40,360
I don't know. I guess I just don't 
 really think about him that much. 

890
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:49,920
He was a composer.

891
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:55,420
He composed modern classical music.
Was a very talented guy.

892
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
But he killed himself when I was nine.

893
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:08,940
He took a bunch of painkillers and a half bottle of whiskey and left me to fend for myself with Lily. 

894
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:18,140
I'm sorry. 
 I shouldn't have brought it up. 

895
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,580
No, no. 
 It's fine. 

896
01:28:27,263 --> 01:28:30,630
So how much money did your mom give you, anyway?

897
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,900
A lot. 

898
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,540
- Over five grand! 
 - Holy shit! 

899

01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,380

904

- I swear I checked. 
 - You checked the cases?

905

Hey. 

909
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,280
No, she's fine.

910
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:28,720
Oh, he did? That's good. 
 We were wondering when we were going to hear from you. 

911
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,440
Well, that's good to hear.

- I'm real proud of her. 
 - Thanks, baby. 

927
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,500
 I think I owe you an apology.

928

 I'm going to grab me another beer. 
 You want one, buddy?

No, thanks 

930

You don't need to apologize.

If there's anybody who has to apologize here, it's me. 

932

No, no. 
 Actually, I do. 

933
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,180
Because what I said to you in Little Rock was not cool.

934
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,600

I don't know what I would have done without her over the last few days.

940
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:17,940
So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, thank you. 

941
