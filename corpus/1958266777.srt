1
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,550
Lieutenant Carapax,

2
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,418
tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

3
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,487
-They're cutting into it now.
-Ah. That's exciting.

4
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,256
I've had them working
around the clock

5
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,291
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

6
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,427
Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

7
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,762
until we're ready
to show the board.

8
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:37,464
Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

9
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,834
-Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
-Sorry.

10
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,335
Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

11
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,571
How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

12
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,907
We'll hit the center
before sunrise.

13
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,909
Well,
push your men harder.

14
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,443
I've searched for 15 years.

15
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,546
I don't want
to wait another second.

16
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,747
Should've called
before making the trip out,
Miss Kord.

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,147
This could be another decoy.

18
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,415
It's in there.

19
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,386
I can feel it.

20
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,861
All right.
Let's do this.

21
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,303
Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

22
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,006
Like you're six figures
in debt.

23
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,876
Okay.

24
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,018
We say nothing for now.

25
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,486
Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

26
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,555
I'll tell him.

27
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,725
What the hell? Why not?

28
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,692
Even good news...

29
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,898
And this is pretty bad news.

30
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,800
I can be joyful.

31
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,902
Your job
is the balloon.

32
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,369
Hope I can handle it.

33
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,738
Handle what?

34
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,740
Hey, hey, hey!

35
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,543
The graduate is here!

36
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,011
- How was your flight?
- Good.

37
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,046
-Are you hungry?
-Of course.

38
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,115
Here. It's all they had.

39
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,483
- Welcome back, bro.
- Thank you.

40
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,886
Nana!

41
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,692
Now we hug!

42
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,361
Hey,
where's Uncle Rudy?

43
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,516
Welcome back,
<i>pinche</i> college boy.

44
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,417
Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

45
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,953
No. No hugs, man.

46
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:53,453
They got <i>Big Brother</i> watching.
There's cameras.

47
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,956
I knew you were gonna
say something.

48
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,456
Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

49
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,424
Yeah,
and they're all so happy

50
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,860
to finally catch you.

51
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,094
You see? It's that kind
of talk right there

52
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,394
that's gonna get us all busted.

53
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,630
Where'd you get this?

54
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,497
I bought it
for Jaime.

55
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,933
A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

56
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:07,467
Come on. What are you doing?

57
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,551
Oh, my God!
I missed this so much.

58
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,854
Good to know
some things don't change.

59
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,925
Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

60
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,693
- Milagro.
- What?

61
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:35,730
Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

62
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:38,599
The truth? What is it?

63
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,834
- We...
- We...

64
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:40,835
We're losing the house.

65
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,637
What?

66
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,505
See?

67
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,773
-He didn't take it that bad.
-No, no, no, losing the house?

68
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,642
What does she mean,
losing the house?

69
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,910
-The landlord tripled the rent.
-They gave us three months

70
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,645
to come up with the money
or get out.

71
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,613
I am so sorry, <i>flaquito.</i>

72
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:55,716
No. <i>Am</i> don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

73
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,818
It just means that
we're gonna have to

74
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,020
bust our ass
at the shop, right?

75
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,956
Mmm... auto shop's gone.

76
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,991
-How?
-You can thank Kord for that.

77
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,960
- Brother.
- We couldn't keep up.

78
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,229
Especially since
your dad, he...

79
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,531
He, uh... had a...

80
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,733
- He...
- Dad had a heart attack.

81
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:13,734
What?

82
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:14,936
I'm fine!

83
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,808
At least the food's the same.

84
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,677
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

85
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,012
You were working so hard,
<i>mi amor.</i>

86
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,548
We didn't want
to distract you from school.

87
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,550
Ma, I could have
done something.

88
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,885
I could have come back.

89
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,087
I could have been here.
I could have--

90
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,522
<i>Animo,</i> Jaime.

91
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,258
We figured it out.
We always do.

92
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,795
We have a lot
to be grateful for. <i>Mira...</i>

93
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,267
Yeah. And the last!

94
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,602
Yes, because you didn't apply.

95
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,804
What,
so I can get into debt

96
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,139
for the rest of my life?
No thanks.

97
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,645
What? 25%?

98
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,881
<i>Mi amor,</i>
these people make nothing.

99
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,516
We are broke.

100
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,185
Let's worry
about money tomorrow.

101
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,768
<i>Remember</i>
<i>how Mom taught us salsa</i>

102
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,203
<i>right there on the front porch?</i>

103
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,171
<i>You were always</i>
<i>better than me.</i>

104
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,706
<i>Yeah.
</i> <i>No, I still think</i> <i>you don't know</i>

105
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,274
<i>how to dance salsa.</i>

106
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,909
<i>Yeah, I got</i>
<i>two left feet. I can't help it.</i>

107
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,277
<i>Yeah.</i>

108
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,713
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>your 21st birthday?</i>

109
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,216
<i>I remember the first half.</i>

110
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,818
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>we're losing this place.</i>

111
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,854
<i>It was rough.</i>

112
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,255
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I'm not leaving again.</i>

113
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,126
What about grad school?

114
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,294
Well, that's not gonna
help the family.

115
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,130
I can't get us
into even more debt.

116
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,099
<i>Animo,</i> bro.

117
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,635
Okay, you always land
on your feet.

118
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,003
You're "Jaime."

119
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,140
Thank you, but...

120
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:03,344
This wasn't how
it was supposed to happen,
Mili.

121
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,146
What was supposed to happen?

122
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,348
I was supposed to make it out.

123
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,283
I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

124
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,685
Thanks, bro,
but I like the Keys.

125
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,290
-You know what I meant.
-Yeah.

126
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,327
Doesn't it bother you

127
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:21,829
that they talk about progress
and get everything

128
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,798
while we have to sit here
and go broke?

129
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:27,034
You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys, <i>carnal.</i>

130
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,804
That progress is not for us.

131
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,306
Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there,

132
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,142
until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

133
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,677
We used to have the other side
of the tracks

134
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,079
and now they want that, too.

135
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,081
I still have a degree, right?

136
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,983
That's gotta mean something.
I'll get a job.

137
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:46,620
Not just any job,
but a prime job.

138
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,255
Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

139
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,761
Don't look at me at like that.
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,

140
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,963
in five years,
we're gonna be rolling in it.

141
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,698
This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

142
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,834
We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

143
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,670
with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

144
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,340
Yeah, just watch, Mili.

145
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,677
Just watch.

146
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,001
Excuse me, Mister Reyes?

147
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,206
You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

148
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,178
This is bullshit.

149
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,347
Wow. "Thanks, Milagro,

150
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,682
for hooking me up
with this gig."

151
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:52,186
It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out
the way you wanted.

152
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,454
How am I supposed to
get experience

153
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,022
when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

154
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,357
Sounds like a "you" problem.

155
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,928
Seriously?

156
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,063
What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

157
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,832
Yes, yes,
we've finally found it.

158
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,834
Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

159
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,836
-With the actual code
in hand...
-Hey.

160
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,905
-...we can move
beyond the prototype phase.
-Check it out.

161
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,206
Yes, yes.

162
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,108
There goes Victoria Kord.

163
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,177
Look at that walk.

164
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,114
She's kinda sexy in like a...
Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

165
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,315
I don't think so.

166
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,483
-I'm gonna say hi.
-What? No--

167
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,118
Good afternoon, ma'am.

168
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,220
If you want, we could.

169
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,856
It's the breakthrough we've
been working towards, General.

170
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,325
Mm-hm.

171
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,427
We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

172
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,763
It's like our superpower.

173
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,765
Okay. Back to work.

174
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,035
I agree. That's a waste
of time, but General,
I am telling you

175
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,103
what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

176
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,172
is gonna blow you away.

177
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,408
Yes. I look forward, also.

178
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,511
Bye.

179
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,212
Aunt Vicki?

180
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,118
Jennifer,
what are you doing here?

181
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,853
I didn't know you were coming.

182
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,755
Oh, Carapax,
this is Ted's daughter.

183
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,458
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

184
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:08,762
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

185
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,901
<i>The world has changed.</i>

186
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:17,238
<i>Kord Industries faces</i>
<i>an unprecedented challenge</i>

187
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:21,976
<i>to secure our assets,</i>
<i>both here and abroad,</i>

188
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,478
<i>from our promethium mines</i>
<i>in Guatemala,</i>

189
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:29,116
<i>to our real estate developments</i>

190
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,254

191
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:38,125
<i>The O.M.A.C.,</i>
<i>the "One Man Army Corps."</i>

192
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,793
Where are we going?

193
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,162
Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

194
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,131
Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

195
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,935
Yeah, and I deserve a luxury
dump right now, all right?

196
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,039
I...

197
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,009
<i>Using</i>
<i>revolutionary Kord symbiotech,</i>

198
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,212
<i>the O.M.A.C. connects directly</i>
<i>into the human brain,</i>

199
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,215
<i>to create a self-contained</i>
<i>war unit,</i>

200
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:06,588
<i>allowing a single soldier</i>
<i>to harness the power</i>

201
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:10,891
<i>The O.M.A.C. ensures security</i>
<i>Kord can rely on.</i>

202
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,093
<i>A future we can control.</i>

203
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,829
<i>The O.M.A.C.</i>

204
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,933
Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

205
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:24,872
So, this... project
was shut down years ago.

206
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,974
Why have you relaunched it?

207
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,843
Jennifer,
the O.M.A.C.
is the future of this company.

208
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,412
You should be so excited.

209
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:36,116
No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

210
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,185
-That's classified.
-Mm.

211
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,554
It's a secret.

212
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,188
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

213
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,990
is what's gonna go on
at this party.

214
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,458
It's gonna be
an amazing evening

215
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,260
with some
very interesting people,

216
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,029
so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

217
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,164
All right, see you later.

218
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,134
I know what
you're doing, Vicki.

219
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,036
We don't make weapons anymore.

220
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,905
Whoa, whoa, "we"?

221
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:01,075
Who's "we"?

222
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,545
You are nothing
to this company.
You're an expense.

223
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,213
A brat in her daddy's
board seat,

224
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,416
jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime,

225
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,019
-doing your "charity work."
-My father would never--

226
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:15,489
Look, your father was handed
a company I built...
my company.

227
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:17,592
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

228
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,362
with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

229
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,565
and then after he'd
done all that,
you know what he did?

230
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:25,065
He just disappeared,

231
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,535
and left me
to pick up the pieces.

232
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,070
Your father
abandoned this company.

233
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:33,307
And he abandoned you.

234
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,275
I won't let you do this.

235
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,683
Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

236
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,618
Back away.

237
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:46,019
I'm not afraid of you.

238
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,088
Maybe you should be.

239
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,057
Hey, hey!

240
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,529
Uh, sh... she said
to back away, ma'am.

241
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,999
Oooh-whee!

242
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,068
That was lavish!

243
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,137
Oh, shit.

244
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,575
And who are you, handsome?

245
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,310
Jaime Reyes.

246
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:14,314
I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

247
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:17,451
-I'm...
-You, too, toilet. Go.

248
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,620
<i>Andale.</i>

249
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,322
Thanks.

250
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,660
Where's the car?

251
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,294
Uh, 47 minutes.

252
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,399
Hey, are you okay? That was--

253
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,168
I appreciate the chivalry,

254
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,003
but I can take care
of myself, okay?

255
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,274
Totally. But I mean...
what a dick, right?

256
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,342
She's a Kord.
They're all dicks.

257
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,179
Jenny Kord.

258
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,650
We're not all dicks.

259
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,418
- Obviously. Yeah. Uh...
- Uh...

260
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,656
Look I'm...
I'm really sorry about this.

261
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,323
It's fine.

262
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,759
Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

263
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,627
Okay. Yeah.

264
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,729
Yeah. Come by
Kord Tower tomorrow.

265
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,997
Okay.

266
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,999
I might be able to get you
a job somewhere else
in our company.

267
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,602
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
That'd be great.

268
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,070
I'll do anything. Really.

269
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,139
Anything, huh?

270
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,208
Hey, you know
he has a degree, right?

271
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,109
-Pre-law.
-I... Yeah.

272
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,045
You guys need any pre-lawyers?

273
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,213
Okay.

274
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,348
-Text me.
-Okay.

275
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,586
Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

276
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,389
Nice to meet you, too...

277
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,192
Jenny Kord.

278
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:34,261
I think she might be into you.

279
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,996
What? No.

280
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,533
Bye.

281
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:41,335
-You think?
-Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,706
She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass,

283
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:48,075
hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

284
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,376
Hey, you know what?

285
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,678
Maybe she'll pull you
out of poverty

286
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,312
-like <i>Maria la del Barrio.</i>
-Okay.

287
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,114
Except, she's
the rich white dude

288
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,783
and you're the Maria!

289
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:57,752
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,481
You drinking?

291
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,419
-Just one.
-Okay.

292
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,522
Don't tell your mother.

293
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,559
Can't sleep?

294
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:13,728
No.

295
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,496
Yeah.

296
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,335
I planted those <i>nopales</i> with
<i>la</i> Nana,

297
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,402
when you were a baby.

298
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,640
Look at them now.

299
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:29,343
Like you and <i>la</i> Mili,
grown and beautiful.

300
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,548
You okay?

301
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,415
Yeah.

302
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,853
Sorry, <i>Apa,</i> it's just
everything right now

303
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,487
feels so out of reach, and...

304
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,727
I feel like I failed you guys.

305
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:53,433
We're on a journey, Jaime...

306
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:57,404
This house, the <i>nopales,</i>
<i>el</i> auto shop.

307
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,607
Everything.

308
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,810
They're just a stop
in the journey.

309
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,345
But this isn't the destination.

310
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,681
And what is it?

311
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,616
I don't know.

312
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,252
What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

313
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,857
Things don't last.

314
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,960
<i>La familia,</i> that's forever.

315
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,494
That lasts.

316
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,270
Everyone has a purpose.

317
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,774
You just haven't found yours.

318
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,441
So what's your purpose then?

319
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,846
I'm still searching, too.

320
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:42,482
But right now, it's this.

321
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:46,453
Talking to you, right here.

322
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,342
Okay.

323
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,300
All right, okay, Jaime.
You got this.

324
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:41,408
God...

325
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,944
Thank you, <i>Apa.</i>

326
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,879
<i>Ya, pues,</i> you guys
can go, okay?

327
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,849
You're gonna be okay, <i>flaquito.</i>
You belong here.

328
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,884
Yeah, <i>cabezon.</i>
You look like an asshole

329
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,384
just like everybody else here.

330
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:01,796
Okay.

331
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,430
-Bring your A-game, bro.
-Yeah.

332
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,298
Bring a Molotov cocktail
to burn this dump down!

333
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,734
Okay!

334
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,302
Hey, and get me a job, too!

335
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:14,407
Jaime, Jaime, Jaime...

336
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,810
They don't get out much.

337
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,950

I'm here to see Jenny Kord.

346
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:43,638
Do you have
an appointment, Jamie?

347
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:46,040
-Um... It's Jaime, but--
-Sorry?

348
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,043
Uh...
Yes, I do have an appointment.

349
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,912
She said to drop by,
so I'm sure I should--

-I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.
-No, that's all good.

372
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:15,790
But you know, yesterday
you said you'd consider
getting me a job

373
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,658
and, you know,
I can't leave without one

00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,160

375
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:20,728

376
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,663

this is really a bad time.

377
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,497

was a hamburger?

393
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,087
Okay, I don't think
it's a burger.

394

395

529
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,097
He's technically
not a missing person,

530
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,398
but he is missing.

531
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:20,702
-But also, he is...
-Possessed!

532
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:27,207
He exploded out of the roof.
With rockets on his back.

533
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:28,475
Shouldn't we be
out there looking for him?

534
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,512
No, no, no!

535
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,313
I'm on hold again.

536
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,484
<i>Return landing successful.</i>

537
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,419
Never mind. We found him.

538
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:45,425
Jaime?

539
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,828
Yo, put those
<i>huevos</i> away, bro.

540
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,602
It's Jamie, not Jaime.

541
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:57,639
Oh, no.

542
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,856
What are you guys doing?

543
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,593
He's alive.

544
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:21,629
Jaime. Do you feel okay, <i>mijo?</i>

545
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:24,331
Oh!

546
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:28,402
No. No way.

547
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,103
Jaime, listen,

548
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:32,139
-there's something on--
-No, not now, Milagro.

549
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:34,107
-Jaime, I'm serious.
-No, no, no. Not now, Milagro.

550
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,342
-Not now!
-There's something on your--

551
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,844
Hey, Jaime,
keep that blanket

552
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:38,345
now that it touched
your <i>chorizo.</i>

553
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:39,714
What is going on?

554
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,281
You can't fly.

555
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,619
You can't fly.
Superman can fly.

556
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:47,789
Those people on that bus
were okay. They're fine.

557
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:51,458
Okay. This probably
happens all the time.

558
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:52,894
Yeah, she wouldn't
do this to me.

559
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,597
Yeah, right. Okay.

560
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:05,305
I tried telling him.

561
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,341
Okay, guys. I... I need
to go find Jenny Kord,

562
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,176
'cause she's gonna know how
to get this thing out of me.

563
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,678
Uh, where are my shoes?

564
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:13,313
Come on, where are my... shoes.

565
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:16,316
Not the 84s!

566
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,218
These were my favorite shoes.

567
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:19,587
Okay, okay.

568
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,689
Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

569
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:23,256
<i>Ama,</i> I don't know.

570
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,158
I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

571
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:27,394
-Cut what?
-...and flew into orbit.

572
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,196
Flew into orbit?
<i>- Apa,</i> I don't know.

573
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,231
-That's why I need Jenny. Okay?
-I am calling the police.

574
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:35,302
No, no. Don't call the police.
No police.
They work for Kord.

575
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:36,838
What do you think
Kord's gonna do

576
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,740
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

577
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,542
has that type of military tech
inside of him?

578
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:43,911
They're gonna lock his ass up.

579
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,813
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

580
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:47,280
so that we don't tell anybody.

581
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,482
And it's not like
the government isn't

582
00:35:48,516 --> 00:35:49,851
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

583
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:52,553
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

584
00:35:52,587 --> 00:35:57,257
-This is Area 51!
-Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

585
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,894
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

586
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,629
are gonna be all over this,

587
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:03,531
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

588
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:07,234
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

589
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,469
Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

590
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,371
You are not leaving this house.

591
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,708
<i>Ama,</i> I'm 22!
Besides, what if she's
in danger?

592
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:15,510
What if she's in danger?

593
00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:17,411
-Jaime, you flew
out of the roof.
-You don't understand.

594
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:19,479
-He's into her.
-Oh, he totally is.

595
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:20,848
-No, I'm not.
-Oh!

596
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:22,482
-Stalked her Insta.
-Where'd I put my...

597
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,652
She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

598
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:26,888
And she's single, by the way.

599
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,456
Bit of a loner, though,
if you ask me. I mean...

600
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:30,758
She's single?

601
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,627
I thought you weren't into her.

602
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,695
What are you doing
with my phone?

603
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:34,629
You left it unlocked.

604
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,603
Yes, the Maria!
Yes, I said the same thing.

605
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:43,905
But <i>Maria la del Barrio.</i>

606
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:58,019
You hear that, <i>flaco?</i>
- Rudy!

607
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,525
No. No, no.

608
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,861
No. No. No!

609
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,295
Jaime!

610
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:11,933
No! No! No!

611
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,266
Ma!

612
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:32,754
So itchy, this thing.

613
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:33,755
Ay, okay.

614
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,458
No way.

615
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:40,862
What the...

616
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:43,497
Wait, what?

617
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:45,566
Jenny?

618
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,370
- Oh, my gosh.
- What are you doing here?

619
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:52,507
-Just go. They're coming.
-Who's them?

620
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,741
Them!

621
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:56,343
-Oh, God. Okay!
-Let's go! Let's go!

622
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:57,945
Okay, okay! Oh, my God!

623
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,580
I told you to go!

624
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:00,748
You should have started with,
"they have guns."

625
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,416
Watch out!

626
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:09,322
Oh, Rudy's
gonna kill me.

627
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:16,429
Oh, my headlights!

628
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,431
No! My mirrors!

629
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:21,669
What the hell, man?

630
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:24,539
What's wrong with you? <i>Cabezon!</i>

631
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:25,973
Do you want some water?

632
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:27,041
My tailgate!

633
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:29,076
No, I'm... I'm good. I'm fine.

634
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,711
Okay.

635
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,049
What did you do to the Taco?

636
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,018
And that... that's Rudy.

637
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:39,887
My name's Cesar, okay?
And only my friends
call me Rudy.

638
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,354
- I'm Jenny.
- "I'm Jenny."

639
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,723
Hi, Jenny.

640
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:44,725
We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

641
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:47,028
Thinking about
turning our house into
a nuclear power plant?

642
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:48,495
I went swimming out there

643
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:49,964
by where your family
has that company.

644
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,667
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

645
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,869
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

646
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:57,437
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

647
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,708
-Where is it?
-Yeah.

648
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:03,110
Allow me.

649
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:04,612
Rudy! What?

650
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:06,581
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

651
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:11,619
I thought the <i>chingaderas</i>
would come out.

652
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:13,120
-Come out?
-Jeez.

653
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:15,056
-What is he talking about?
-He's talking about this.

654
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,893
Oh, I forgot
how bad it looks.

655
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:21,062
No, it doesn't look that bad.

656
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:23,798
I've seen worse.

657
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,566
-Where?
-You don't wanna know.

658
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,467
Okay, what the hell
is this thing?

659
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,469
It's... it's called the Scarab.

660
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:32,173
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

661
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,675
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

662
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,043
Oh, that's nice.

663
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,511
-Weapon?
-What did she say?

664
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:39,847
What?

665
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:41,916
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

666
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:44,685
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

667
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,754
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea
this would happen.

668
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,589
I mean, come on.

669
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:50,490
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

670
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:51,759
It has to choose you.

671
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,830
So I'm guessing
it's chosen you.

672
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,430
No more blind dates.

673
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:00,635
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

674
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:03,037
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

675
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,472
because my aunt
will kill us all
just to get it back.

676
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:06,741
Kill us?

677
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:08,042
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

678
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,810
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

679
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,679
Yeah.

680
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:17,484
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

681
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,654
I had no idea
it would activate.

682
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:20,988
Really. I didn't know.

683
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,890
That's convenient.

684
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:24,457
But she already said
she didn't know.

685
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:26,527
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

686
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:32,600
We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

687
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,736
Come on, we are the Reyes.

688
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,039
We've dealt with harder things.

689
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:40,107
We have?

690
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:44,578
<i>Animo.</i> We can do this.

691
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:48,049
Yeah. Yeah, <i>Apa.</i>

692
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:49,717
He's right.

693
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,221
Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

694
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,857
You know, before it
busts another hole
in our house.

695
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,926
Exactly.

696
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,696
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

697
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,098
But we need the key.

698
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,867
Okay, so where's the key?

699
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,903
At the Kord building.

700
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:11,138
And they're probably
on high alert over there
since I took the Scarab.

701
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:14,809
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

702
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:16,610
Wide area motion imagery?

703
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:18,746
Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

704
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:21,949
I really don't--

705
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,518
Because I've been
working on something
that I believe can help us.

706
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:27,154
And it's almost finished.

707
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,990
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

708
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:30,091
Mm. I love you, Ma.

709
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:32,059
Give me a couple hours.

710
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:04,325
You're aware that
if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

711
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:05,793
you'd be the most powerful

712
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:07,628
weapons manufacturer
in the world.

713
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,663
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

714
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:11,866
Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

715
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:15,202
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

716
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:18,172
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

717
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:21,175
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

718
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,977
during the anti-communist

719
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,747
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

720
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:29,016
He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

721
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,018
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

722
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:32,620
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

723
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:37,591
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

724
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,760
-When will it be ready?
-Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

725
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:43,097
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

726
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,799
We have a problem.

727
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,867
Well, if you'll excuse us.

728
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:50,271
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

729
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:55,009
You lost her? How?

730
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,844
My men saw someone helping her.

731
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:59,747
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

732
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,050
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

733
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:06,687
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

734
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,322
This time
I'll do it personally.

735
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:11,125
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

736
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:13,928
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

737
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:17,665
Just think of how much
suffering your body
has been through.

738
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

739
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:23,737
My God... What <i>we've</i> done.

740
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:29,043
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

741
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:32,146
Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

742
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,616
How badly crippled you were?

743
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,918
How broken?

744
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,324
I am just trying to fix you.

745
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:44,658
Okay?

746
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:48,929
Good.

747
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,731
I have to go back to the party.

748
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:54,702
Now, go get me that Scarab.

749
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:06,180
That's it?

750
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:09,049
I call it, <i>El Chapulin.</i>

751
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,319
Why?

752
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:14,188
You know,
when you make something cool,

753
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:16,423
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

754
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:19,460
Here, be useful. Hold that.

755
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,761
You're sure
that this one works?

756
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:23,164
Thank you. Yes.

757
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:27,168
Unlike the junk
that Kord makes,
my tech delivers.

758
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:28,903
Okay. You could have
just said yes.

759
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:30,838
Okay, cupcake, you wanna
hit that yellow switch there?

760
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:32,173
Hit the yellow switch.

761
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:34,175
I just did.

762
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:38,345
Okay.

763
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,114
Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

764
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,815
It's going on your tab.

765
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,918
So just give me,
like, one step.

766
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:44,985
Just gotta give it a little...

767
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:50,858
- Oh, that's sexy.
- Great.

768
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:53,194
That's... that's great.
Uh, so it works.

769
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:56,430
Uh, yeah, it works.

770
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:58,132
I'll keep the truck running.

771
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,033
- Let's go.
- Wow.

772
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:03,003
"So it works?"

773
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,174
Guys!

774
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:10,211
Something's happening.

775
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:16,917
What the hell is this?

776
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:22,022
<i>El Chapulin Colorado!</i>

777
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:26,794
<i>So join me and my little pals</i>

778
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,195
<i>and all of our Kord</i>
<i>subsidiaries...</i>

779
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:29,997
The key's here.

780
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,168
<i>...around the globe,</i>
<i>to build a better future.</i>

781
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,103
<i>A Kord future.</i>

782
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,041
She seemed so different
back then.

783
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:45,045
Vicki and my grandfather
started Kord Industries
together...

784
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:47,948
and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

785
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:50,985
Then, when my grandfather died,

786
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:54,355
Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

787
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:57,024
But he left everything
to my dad instead.

788
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,527
-Seems kind of--
-Sexist?

789
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,028
Yeah.

790
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,930
Yeah.

791
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:05,299
Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

792
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:07,368
in a different direction.

793
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:10,771
So, Victoria became
obsessed with erasing
my father's legacy.

794
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:14,074
Could I get a hand over here?

795
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,044
Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

796
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:19,113
-Just hold this.
-Okay.

797
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:20,981
There's a signal blocking
our feed.

798
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:22,249
We're being jammed out.

799
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:28,523
Lieutenant Carapax?
We got a problem.

800
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,432
-This is the key?
-Yeah.

801
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:41,902
Okay, let's go.

802
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:42,903
Let's go.

803
00:46:56,216 --> 00:46:59,486
This is why
I don't let anyone
drive the Taco!

804
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:03,257
To be honest, I didn't
think the <i>Chapulin</i> would work.

805
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,060
Yeah, that's Rudy.
 He's like the Mexican Doc Brown.

806
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,595
No kidding. Okay.

807
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:09,564
- So that's all you need?
 -Yeah.

808
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:12,032
Oh, my God.
I don't know why I thought

809
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:14,068
it was gonna be
way harder than that.

810
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,369
Oh, shit.

811
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:19,106
The Scarab, now!

812
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,174
What is he doing here?

813
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:24,478
Should we run?
He's not slowing down.

814
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:26,146
Watch out! Watch out!

815
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,090
<i>Hola, Jaime.</i>

816
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,395
Oh, my gosh. How'd you do that?

817
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:42,564
I have no idea.

818
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:48,636
Oh, he's pissed.

819
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:08,389
What the hell is that thing?

820
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:09,557
The O.M.A.C.

821
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:15,229
You're going to regret that.

822
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:16,598
<i>Defending host.</i>

823
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:18,600
Oh, my God. Quick!
Go find Rudy!

00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:24,606

Okay, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, wait! Don't!

827
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:36,984
What did you do that for?
I told you not to engage.

828
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:49,564
<i>I have</i>
<i>an arsenal at my disposal.</i>

829
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,031
No! No weapons.

Ooh. And my song, too! Ay!

831
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,441
-Cesar!

832
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:01,743
-What the heck,

-There!

833
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,146
Hey! Calm down!

834
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:13,487
Oh, shit!

835
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:14,421
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.
-Let's go, let's go!

836
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,762
Let me talk to him.

837
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:21,763

Hey, man, look! I think this is
just one big misunderstanding--

840
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:29,336
I didn't mean
to punch you back there.

841
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,338
I promise, I would never--

842
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,340
I'm not
in control of this thing.

843
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:37,077
No, no, no,
let me explain!

844
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,680
Never mind. He's not listening.

845
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:40,314
<i>Permission</i>

00:51:15,843 --> 00:51:17,411
I told you, I'm not a--

877
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:21,315
<i>Warning,</i>
<i>host concussion detected.</i>

878
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:32,827
You should have finished me

879
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,328
when you had the chance.

880
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:36,831
He's gonna kill him.

881
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,610
No. He's not.

882
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:49,744
Hold on.

883
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:56,684
Please, just don't
hurt my family.

884
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:59,654
The love you feel
for your family

885
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:01,421
makes you weak.

886
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,390
Cesar! What are you doing?

887
00:52:03,423 --> 00:52:05,192
Okay, Kord girl.

888
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:09,196
When I tell you, pull that
handbrake and pull it hard.

889
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,698
-You ready?
-Oh, my gosh, this is insane.

890
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:14,301
Three, two, one.

891
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:15,536
Now!

892
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,279
<i>Cabezon,</i>
let's get outta here!

893
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,193
Is he okay? Jaime! Jaime!

894
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:41,929
Jenny! Snap out of it!

895
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:43,831
- Okay.
-  -Don't look, don't look!

896
00:52:43,865 --> 00:52:45,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

897
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:49,302
I'm fine, Rudy. Thank you.

898
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:52,239
All right. I got a T-shirt.
On the side.

899
00:52:52,272 --> 00:52:54,341
All right. Okay.

900
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:55,910
Man...

901
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:58,311
Oh, that psycho
almost killed me.

902
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:02,817
You got the key?

903
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,619
-All right.
-Yeah.

904
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:06,988
Good. Now, let's go get
that Scarab taken out of you.

905
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:09,222
-Khaji-Da.
-Khaji <i>que?</i>

906
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:11,358
The Scarab's name is Khaji-Da.

907
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:12,694
How do you know?

908
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:15,395
I... Something happened
back there. My...

909
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:17,899
It's like I feel it in my mind.
Is that crazy?

910
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:22,003
You're becoming symbiotic.

911
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:23,805
-What?
-Okay, where to now?

912
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,608
-Take that exit.
-What? Hold on!

913
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:28,643
No, no, no!

914
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:33,614
Does anybody
in this town
know how to drive?

915
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:44,559
Oh!

916
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:48,830
They're not gonna
look for you here?

917
00:53:48,863 --> 00:53:50,698
No one's been here
since I was eight.

918
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:16,591
Yeah, I get it.
That makes sense.

919
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:24,766
So, your dad was all
obsessed with Scarabs, huh?

920
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:29,837
Where are we?

921
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:36,744
No way.

922
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:40,715
Wait.

923
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:43,450
Ted Kord was Blue Beetle?

924
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:46,754
Wow!

925
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:48,589
What the hell is Blue Beetle?

926
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:51,358
Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

927
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,494
Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

928
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:56,097
But just, uh...

929
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,433
I don't know,
maybe just not... not as good.

930
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,370
I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

931
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:05,072
Oh, I get it though.

932
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:10,443
Eccentric billionaire,
a genius.
<i>El Escarabajo Azul.</i>

933
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:13,681
Your dad was a great man.
I had no idea.

934
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:15,382
You can call me Cesar or Rudy.

935
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:17,985
You can call me whatever
you want, I don't care.

936
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:19,086
Hey, how come all of this--

937
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:24,424
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

938
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:26,994
Um, what were you saying?

939
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:29,096
Yeah, how come this stuff
doesn't look more like--

940
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,766
Nicer? Less ridiculous?

941
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:33,768
No. But I mean...

942
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,540
Like, look at this.
It's like Batman's stuff,
but...

943
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:41,441
like if he had ADHD
or something.

944
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,376
Batman's a fascist.

945
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,413
The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

946
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:50,618
My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

947
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:54,956
So instead, he built his own
tech to fight as Blue Beetle.

948
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:57,725
If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

949
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:59,894
Let's crack into this sucker.

950
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:06,133
-Damn, you stink.
-This is your shirt.

951
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,836
Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

952
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,972
That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

953
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,478
Jeez.

954
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,114
When is this day gonna end?

955
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:28,656
Whoa.

956
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:32,059
Ay.

957
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:35,963
Is everything okay?

958
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:40,201
Um, yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right out.

959
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:44,105
Yeah, I think they, uh...
I think they fit.

960
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:45,673
And they're comfy, too, so...

961
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:50,144
Good.

962
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:53,047
It must have been
so cool growing up
in a place like this, no?

963
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,849
Honestly, it was...

964
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:57,051
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

965
00:56:58,653 --> 00:56:59,987
It was just
you three in here?

966
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,454
Yeah.

967
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:02,924
That was my mother's
last painting.

968
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:05,226
Why'd she stop?

969
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,128
My mom died when I was six.

970
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:11,799
Oh... We don't...

971
00:57:11,832 --> 00:57:13,567
-I'm so sorry to...
-It's okay. No, it's okay.

972
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,602
It's fine.

973
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:17,672
What was she like?

974
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:20,574
She was great.

975
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,878
She was great.

976
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:29,650
She changed my dad's life.

977
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:31,686
She was the one who taught him
that the world

978
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:32,987
is a place to protect.

979
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,021
Nice.

980
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:40,094
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

981
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:46,534
He obsessed over the Scarab

982
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:48,468
and he would disappear
for days.

983
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:51,839
Sometimes weeks.

984
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:54,141
And one day, he...

985
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:57,244
he left and...

986
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,581
didn't come back.

987
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,250
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

988
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:10,524
You're really lucky.

989
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:14,494
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

990
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,798
Your house is full of love.

991
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:22,036
A family.

992
00:58:23,938 --> 00:58:25,172
Yeah.

993
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:26,574
That's a home.

994
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:33,681
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

995
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:35,316
Sorry for... for what?

996
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:39,153
I... I haven't
talked about this
in a very long time.

997
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:43,157
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

998
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:46,660
Thank you.

999
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:48,662
Yeah.

1000
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:50,031
You're a good listener.

1001
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:54,101
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

1002
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,577
Hey, guys,
I found something that-- Ho!

1003
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:05,546
-Nothing happened.
-Her mom died.

1004
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:08,182
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1005
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:11,619
Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

1006
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,655
Nice jammies, <i>guey.</i>

1007
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:22,963
Okay.
I've gone through the files.

1008
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:26,767
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1009
00:59:26,801 --> 00:59:29,070
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1010
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:30,905
before it chose you, Jaime.

1011
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:33,874
And <i>pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1012
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:36,677
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1013
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,013
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1014
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,781
It didn't go up my ass.

1015
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:42,983
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1016
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:45,853
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,
connect to your brain.

1017
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,688
It's trying to become one
with you.

1018
00:59:47,721 --> 00:59:48,889
Why?

1019
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:50,157
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1020
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:51,926
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1021
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:53,027
It's sentient.

1022
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,229
That's why it chooses a host.

1023
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:58,032
That's why sometimes,
it does what you want,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

1024
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,034
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1025
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,136
This wasn't made
on Earth, <i>cabezon.</i>

1026
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:03,904
-No way.
<i>-Si</i> way.

1027
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:06,006
It's alien.

1028
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,775
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

1029
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:09,810
-You can use it, but I just--
-Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1030
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:13,380
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?
How did he get it out?

1031
01:00:13,414 --> 01:00:14,682
You might want to sit down.

1032
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:19,687
-Or not. All right--
-Rudy, please. Focus.

1033
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,288
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1034
01:00:21,322 --> 01:00:23,657
The good news is,
I figured out how
to get it out.

1035
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,059
Fine.

1036
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:27,261
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1037
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:30,030
-What?
-Dead.

1038
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,332
What do you
mean "dead"?

1039
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:33,000
Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

1040
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:35,269
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1041
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:38,839
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1042
01:00:38,873 --> 01:00:41,041
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1043
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:43,811
It's designed
to protect its host.

1044
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:45,346
To keep it alive.

1045
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:47,448
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1046
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,683
No, it's not forever.

1047
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:51,285
I mean, it's just until you...

1048
01:00:52,253 --> 01:00:53,921
until you die.

1049
01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:55,856
I think it's kinda cool.

1050
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:59,126
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, <i>cabron.</i>

1051
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,695
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

1052
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:04,398
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are
my options now?

1053
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:07,801
So, option one is
to become an android

1054
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,370
for the rest of my life.

1055
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:11,839
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1056
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,807
-billionaire psychopath?
-I'm so sorry.

1057
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,176
All I wanted was a job.

1058
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,711
- Maybe there's a--
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1059
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:19,246
It's all bad news.

1060
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,814
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1061
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,416
I don't understand
why you can't...

1062
01:01:23,217 --> 01:01:25,786
God.

1063
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:28,255
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1064
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:30,124
Jaime, just...

1065
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:32,359
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know
where he's going.

1066
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,828
<i>Cabezon,</i> wait up.

1067
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,073
God.

1068
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:54,915
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1069
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:56,850
Like a cat, Jaime.

1070
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,428
I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1071
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:09,797
- I shouldn't have
yelled at you, but...

1072
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,933
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1073
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,102
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1074
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:19,373
Yeah, we're...

1075
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,475
we're resilient people.

1076
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:25,312
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1077
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:28,882
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1078
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:33,087
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1079
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,992
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1080
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:40,528
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1081
01:02:40,562 --> 01:02:42,564
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1082
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:47,201
The next 20 years after,
I mean, <i>la chinga.</i>

1083
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:51,839
But your <i>viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1084
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:54,041
Any <i>ja</i> he could
get his hands on.

1085
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:56,511
<i>Jornalero,</i> bus boy, waiter.

1086
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:59,880
He was a mechanic,
<i>era de todo,</i> dishwasher.

1087
01:03:01,982 --> 01:03:05,185
And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

1088
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:07,988
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1089
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:11,125
That's what we come from.

1090
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:14,928
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1091
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:17,965
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do
with it.

1092
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:19,933
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1093
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:24,171
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1094
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:28,042
And not just some
foot up our ass.

1095
01:03:29,343 --> 01:03:30,377
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1096
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:31,979
I'm just some failed promise

1097
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:33,548
that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1098
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:36,817
Don't say that, man.

1099
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:39,420
You're not a failed promise.

1100
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:42,122
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1101
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,058
- I am the shit.
- Yeah.

1102
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:48,862
And... and I love you.

1103
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:51,533
And I love you, too, <i>cabezon.</i>
Yeah, all right.

1104
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,467
Guys?

1105
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:56,837
Do you hear that?

1106
01:03:58,238 --> 01:03:59,340
That's Victoria.

1107
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,213
Where are they going?

1108
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:09,917
Home.

1109
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:13,420
You're wasting
too much water.

1110
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,200
It's always my fault.

1111
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:29,069
Yeah.

1112
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:55,362
Guys?

1113
01:04:57,264 --> 01:04:58,999
I think there's somebody
at the window.

1114
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:10,477
<i>Jaime Reyes,</i>
<i>come out with your hands up.</i>

1115
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,146
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

1116
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:15,149
<i>We are authorized</i>
<i>to use deadly force.</i>

1117
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:17,451
<i>Jaime Reyes,</i>
<i>come out with your hands up...</i>

1118
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:21,288
<i>We are authorized</i>
<i>to use deadly force.</i>

1119
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:23,157
Okay. Okay.

1120
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,726
Um...

1121
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:27,194
I'm gonna fly. I'm gonna fly.

1122
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:28,295
Let's do this.

1123
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:31,666
Yeah!

1124
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,003
Yeah, no chance.

1125
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:39,406
Now!

1126
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,743
-Ay!
-Dude, no worries.

1127
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:43,645
-Just take your time.
-Thanks, Jenny.

1128
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:45,979
-You gotta force it
to come out.
-What do you...

1129
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:51,084
Oh. Oh.

1130
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,422
-You're a genius.
-I know. What'd I say?

1131
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:56,990
You said this thing's
gonna protect me, right?

1132
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:58,325
- I...
- It's not gonna let me die?

1133
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:00,394
No, no. I mean, when you die...

1134
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:01,995
- All right, let's see if it works.
-  -I wouldn't test it.

1135
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,565
-No, no, no, Jaime!
-Wait, wait, wait, Jaime!

1136
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,118
Well, back to the Tacoma,
I guess.

1137
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,153
Yeah.

1138
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:35,095
<i>We have</i> <i>the Reyes house surrounded.
</i> <i>The family's inside.</i>

1139
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:36,430
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1140
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:38,766
Round them up!

1141
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,234
Breach team, go.

1142
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:42,069
On me.

1143
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:46,306
We're in!

1144
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:50,244
Fan out. Flash!

1145
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,647
Clear!

1146
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,516
-Get the light on.
-I got your left!

1147
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:57,150
Back room, clear!

1148
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:00,187
Clear!

1149
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,356
- Hands on your head.
Don't move.

1150
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:03,691
- Okay, okay.
- Don't move!

1151
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:05,158
-Don't touch my family!
-Get up!

1152
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:07,094
Let's go! Up, up!

1153
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:08,796
Hands up! Watch your two!

1154
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,198
- Miss Kord,
we found the family.

1155
01:07:13,801 --> 01:07:15,837
- We got 'em coming out.
-  Take 'em out.

1156
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,605
Let's go.

1157
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,507
Drag them out!

1158
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:22,777
Come on! Let's go, come on!

1159
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,779
- Let her go!
- Move, move!

1160
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:28,850
Let's go, let's go!

1161
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:35,557
Let's go!

1162
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,592
Do not resist!

1163
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:41,395
No! No! No!

1164
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,802
Get on the ground.
On the ground!

1165
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:50,572
Get down, now!
Let's go, now!

1166
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,576
The kid's not there.

1167
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:56,811
Find him!

1168
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,614
Is he inside?

1169
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:01,749
Where is he?

1170
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,118
Where is he?

1171
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:07,220
Where is he?

1172
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:13,126
I could use
that arsenal right about now.

1173
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,896
<i>Thought you'd never ask.</i>

1174
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,096
Hell yeah!

1175
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,807
Nice work, Khaji.
You guys okay?

1176
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,408
-Jaime?
-Sorry, I'm late, Mom.

1177
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,811
Magnificent.

1178
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:31,445
Wait, what?

1179
01:08:31,478 --> 01:08:32,914
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1180
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:35,550
Look, don't shoot.
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

1181
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,451
<i>Fire!</i>

1182
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:39,721
God damn it!
I said don't shoot.

1183
01:08:43,558 --> 01:08:45,827
Oh, my God. I'm bulletproof.

1184
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,595
Let's see what you can do.

1185
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:50,531
Target the family.

1186
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:52,800
<i>- Engage.</i>
- Take 'em out.

1187
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:57,304
I got you guys.
Don't worry.

1188
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:58,405
It's gonna be okay.

1189
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,209
Okay, let's see what you got.

1190
01:09:02,242 --> 01:09:03,443
<i>Eliminating threats.</i>

1191
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:05,345
What? No, Khaji, no killing.

1192
01:09:06,648 --> 01:09:08,650
Yeah, that's more like it.

1193
01:09:17,925 --> 01:09:18,860
Get out of here.

1194
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:20,227
Run!

1195
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:23,330
<i>Analyzing threat level.</i>

1196
01:09:23,363 --> 01:09:24,699
Okay. Let's do this.

1197
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:36,243
Hell yeah!

1198
01:09:37,712 --> 01:09:38,746
Down on the ground!

1199
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,615
- <i>Papi!</i>
- Mili!

1200
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:42,517
We got one.

1201
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:45,185
- Stay down.
Don't move.

1202
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:46,921
Stay where you are.

1203
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:49,657
- No!
<i>- We got another one.</i>

1204
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:50,758
Dad!

1205
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:53,695
Come to papa.

1206
01:09:58,365 --> 01:09:59,734
Carapax, ready the claw.

1207
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,779
Daddy, I'm scared.

1208
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:14,716
Everything
is gonna be okay.

1209
01:10:14,749 --> 01:10:16,751
<i>- Jaime, your family.</i>
- Stay down!

1210
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,690
Okay, come on, <i>Papi.</i>

1211
01:10:22,724 --> 01:10:25,593
Mili, get Dad outta here. Go!

1212
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:27,562
-Go!
-Okay. Okay, let's go.

1213
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:31,298
Ready.

1214
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:36,470
<i>They have a weapon.</i>
<i>I suggest we retreat.</i>

1215
01:10:36,503 --> 01:10:39,841
No way. They attack my family,
we're gonna finish this.

1216
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:42,442
And...

1217
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,914
Dad.

1218
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:49,416
Dad, no. Dad, what's wrong?

1219
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:50,785
Dad! Dad!

1220
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:53,788
No, no, no! Dad!

1221
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:55,422
No!

1222
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:56,924
No, no, no.

1223
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,826
- Dad!
- No!

1224
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,727
Now!

1225
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,932
Now, what's happening?

1226
01:11:04,966 --> 01:11:08,502
<i>Symbiotic systems...</i>
- Khaji, do something!

1227
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:14,942
Dad, no!

1228
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:17,545
Dad! <i>Apa!</i>

1229
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:19,013
<i>-Apa!</i>
-Jaime!

1230
01:11:24,085 --> 01:11:27,454
No. No, no, no.

1231
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,523
No.

1232
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:30,323
No, Jaime.

1233
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:32,660
Jaime, watch out!

1234
01:11:32,693 --> 01:11:35,663
You! You!

1235
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:37,565
What do you want with us?

1236
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,536
- Dad, no!
- What are you doing?

1237
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:43,971
Get this thing off of me,
you psycho!

1238
01:11:44,806 --> 01:11:47,809
Mom!

1239
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:50,477
<i>- Mami!</i>
- Mili!

1240
01:11:50,511 --> 01:11:52,880
Alberto!

1241
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:54,015
Alberto.

1242
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:56,017
Let me go!

1243
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,553
- Khaji, do something!
- I got him. Let's go.

1244
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:01,622
<i>Apa!</i>

1245
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,811
- Rudy. Rudy, Rudy.
- Wake up.

1246
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:29,517
<i>Apa!</i>

1247
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:33,788
I'm gonna come...
I'm gonna come get you.

1248
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:46,133
Call an ambulance.

1249
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:07,855
Clear!

1250
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:11,391
Clear! Clear!

1251
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,771
Mm?

1252
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,052
Nana is right, Mili.
We have to go and save Jaime.

1253
01:14:45,086 --> 01:14:49,523
How? Okay,
we don't even know
where they took him.

1254
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:51,058
I might know
where he is.

1255
01:14:55,096 --> 01:14:56,130
Please.

1256
01:14:57,098 --> 01:14:58,165
Come with me.

1257
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:01,836
I can help.

1258
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,141
Watch your step.

1259
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:29,864
All right.

1260
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,132
Let's do this.

1261
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:37,071
Let's go.

1262
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:38,906
Okay, okay.

1263
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:40,141
I'm done, I'm done.

1264
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,078
Okay, guys.

1265
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,713
Let's hope
this Kord tech works.

1266
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:54,188
Hang on.

1267
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,324
Okay...

1268
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:01,228
Dude!

1269
01:16:12,073 --> 01:16:13,941
- There.
-  -<i>Welcome back</i> <i>to the Bug Ship, Teddy.</i>

1270
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:15,009
Oh, that's sexy.

1271
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:16,343
Look at you.

1272
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:17,645
- This is sick.
- Thrusters!

1273
01:16:25,352 --> 01:16:26,987
- Let's go get our boy.
- Let's do this.

1274
01:16:27,021 --> 01:16:27,922
Jenny.

1275
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:35,763
Okay. Good, good,
good. Good.

1276
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:46,373
So, what's the plan
when we get there?

1277
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:48,142
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

1278
01:16:48,175 --> 01:16:49,844
That's not
how you say--

1279
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,156
<i>Ama,</i> I'm flying!

1280
01:17:02,189 --> 01:17:03,657
Whoo!

1281
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:10,931
After 15 years,
everything we've done,

1282
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:13,100
every sacrifice we've made,

1283
01:17:13,134 --> 01:17:16,003
has led to this moment.

1284
01:17:16,036 --> 01:17:20,107
Finally, the power
of the Scarab will be ours.

1285
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,909
Almost there.

1286
01:17:21,942 --> 01:17:24,745
We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

1287
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:26,180
Are you ready?

1288
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,348
I'm ready.

1289
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,825
Is this thing bulletproof?

1290
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:50,905
Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

1291
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:57,978
Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

1292
01:17:58,012 --> 01:18:00,981
Oh, no, no.
 That's not what you think it is.

1293
01:18:01,015 --> 01:18:03,851
It's just a special prototype

1294
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:06,954
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

1295
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:08,489
Do these things work?

1296
01:18:08,523 --> 01:18:10,858
Mm... some of them.

1297
01:18:12,026 --> 01:18:13,093
Sometimes.

1298
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:16,297
Whoa.

1299
01:18:18,299 --> 01:18:20,067
Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

1300
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,936
Try pressing another button.

1301
01:18:28,809 --> 01:18:31,745
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

1302
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:38,285
Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

1303
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:39,820
how to use these things?

1304
01:18:42,089 --> 01:18:44,091
Nana?

1305
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:47,061
Hey. How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

1306
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:00,441
This is where
they took Jaime.

1307
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:03,911
Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

1308
01:19:03,944 --> 01:19:06,947
that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

1309
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:08,983
The place is a fortress.

1310
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:10,417
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

1311
01:19:13,354 --> 01:19:14,822
What the hell?

1312
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:16,056
Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk

1313
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,525
about Nana's
revolutionary past.

1314
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:18,492
Her what?

1315
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:36,844
Yeah,
the generators are here.

1316
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:38,112
- Mm.
- We could blow them up

1317
01:19:38,145 --> 01:19:40,180
and knock power out.

1318
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:50,558
Hm?

1319
01:19:50,592 --> 01:19:53,127
Damn, Nana.

1320
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:16,317
Hey, who are you?

1321
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:20,354
What're you doing?
Get me out of this thing,
please?

1322
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:22,524
Is there a problem,
Sanchez?

1323
01:20:22,557 --> 01:20:24,258
I'm sorry.

1324
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,393
You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

1325
01:20:26,427 --> 01:20:27,861
Tell her to get me out of this!

1326
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:32,900
It's okay. It's okay.

1327
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:35,570
Yeah. Listen, kid.

1328
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:39,173
The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

1329
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:44,345
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1330
01:20:44,378 --> 01:20:46,413
But now that you've
activated it,

1331
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:50,217
we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

1332
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,519
What are you
even talking about?

1333
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:54,021
No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

1334
01:20:54,054 --> 01:20:55,889
Oh, bummer.

1335
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:59,326
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

1336
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,963
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1337
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:04,566
Do it, Sanchez.

1338
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:06,534
With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.

1339
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:08,969
Hey, hey!
Get me outta this thing!

1340
01:21:12,306 --> 01:21:14,341
Damn it.

1341
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,156
Bug.

1342
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:31,024
- Rudy.
- Yeah, I see it.

1343
01:21:34,395 --> 01:21:35,462
You're going too fast!

1344
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:38,365
Here goes nothing.

1345
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:43,003
Hold on, hold on!

1346
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:47,040
All right. All right.

1347
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,712
Incoming!

1348
01:21:50,745 --> 01:21:52,079
Brace for impact!

1349
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,362
Let's go, let's go!

1350
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:10,698
On the wall! Engage. Engage.

1351
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,438
Rudy, do something.

1352
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:19,440
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

1353
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:33,621
Here we go!

1354
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:39,761
Whoa.

1355
01:22:39,794 --> 01:22:41,061
Okay, okay.

1356
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,580
Get out of the way. Sorry!

1357
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:06,053
It's like I can't miss.
- Right there, right there.

1358
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:13,227
- Twenty points!
- Whoo-hoo!

1359
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,575
Activating cloaking system.

1360
01:23:29,577 --> 01:23:31,311
<i>Activating bug fart.</i>

1361
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:40,522
Take that!

1362
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:43,357
Whoo!

1363
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:15,489
-Yeah, this way.
-Okay.

1364
01:24:15,523 --> 01:24:17,124
Hey! Come on.

1365
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:19,861
I know you can hear me.

1366
01:24:23,297 --> 01:24:24,599
Just let me out!

1367
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:37,077
I'll keep it safe.

1368
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:39,279
Start the transfer.

1369
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:41,481
And when it's complete,
kill the kid.

1370
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:43,718
Get me out of here!

1371
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:45,218
But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

1372
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:46,821
from his connection
to the Scarab--

1373
01:24:46,854 --> 01:24:48,121
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

1374
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:51,091
Let me out! No! No!

1375
01:25:09,176 --> 01:25:10,878
Milagro, here, hide!

1376
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:22,422
Holy shit.

1377
01:25:23,524 --> 01:25:24,792
Okay, I think we're good.

1378
01:25:26,828 --> 01:25:27,829
What the...

1379
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:37,605
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

1380
01:25:37,639 --> 01:25:39,674
What the hell
is this?

1381
01:25:39,707 --> 01:25:42,175
Fully operational
O.M.A.C. systems.

1382
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:44,144
Enough to build an entire army.

1383
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:00,327
Miss Kord, this...
this isn't looking good.

1384
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,596
What's going on?

1385
01:26:01,629 --> 01:26:03,330
Oh, no.
The Scarab download

1386
01:26:03,363 --> 01:26:04,932
is generating too much power.
Our systems are spiking.

1387
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:06,601
What does it mean?

1388
01:26:06,634 --> 01:26:08,703
The transfer is killing him.

1389
01:26:08,736 --> 01:26:11,405
He can't die before
the transfer is completed.

1390
01:26:11,438 --> 01:26:12,640
His pulse is dropping.

1391
01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:14,441
Well, just fix it!

1392
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:37,932
Hey, <i>flaco.</i>

1393
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:50,277
Dad.

1394
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:54,615
What's going on?

1395
01:26:58,653 --> 01:27:00,320
What are you doing here?

1396
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:05,325
You know.

1397
01:27:06,994 --> 01:27:09,429
No. <i>Apa.</i>

1398
01:27:22,677 --> 01:27:26,279
Milagro, here.
Help me with these.

1399
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:51,839
Jaime.

1400
01:27:54,809 --> 01:27:57,078
This is not your time.

1401
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:58,546
You have to go back.

1402
01:28:01,381 --> 01:28:02,850
Please.

1403
01:28:02,884 --> 01:28:05,285
I understand everything now.

1404
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:09,757
My destiny was
to be here with you.

1405
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,424
In this moment.

1406
01:28:12,492 --> 01:28:14,595
To help you cross into it.

1407
01:28:24,672 --> 01:28:26,373
This is your purpose.

1408
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:01,341
<i>It's time for you</i>
<i>to accept your destiny, Jaime.</i>

1409
01:29:15,656 --> 01:29:17,658
How am I gonna
do this without you?

1410
01:29:22,096 --> 01:29:24,599
How am I
gonna know what to do?

1411
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:43,483
I love you, too, <i>Papi.</i>

1412
01:30:03,204 --> 01:30:04,605
Something's happening.

1413
01:30:05,139 --> 01:30:07,008
What?

1414
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:09,043
His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

1415
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:10,845
Right there.
They're connecting.

1416
01:30:16,117 --> 01:30:17,985
I need you, Khaji!

1417
01:30:20,988 --> 01:30:22,723
They're becoming one.

1418
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:35,169
We've got the code?

1419
01:30:35,202 --> 01:30:36,469
The transfer's complete.

1420
01:30:36,503 --> 01:30:37,705
The code is ours.

1421
01:30:37,738 --> 01:30:39,040
It's working!

1422
01:30:55,156 --> 01:30:56,590
Oh, no.

1423
01:30:58,559 --> 01:30:59,794
Go, go, go!

1424
01:31:17,545 --> 01:31:19,847
Okay. Here we go.

1425
01:31:38,933 --> 01:31:40,500
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1426
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:59,086
No. No, no, no.

1427
01:32:01,622 --> 01:32:03,324
Sanchez, stop him!

1428
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:04,825
Oh, shit.

1429
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:17,938
What?

1430
01:32:17,972 --> 01:32:20,107
Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

1431
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:21,709
-Wait, wait, wait. My family?
-Quickly!

1432
01:32:21,742 --> 01:32:23,544
What do you mean my family?

1433
01:32:24,245 --> 01:32:25,780
Go!

1434
01:32:25,813 --> 01:32:28,015
Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

1435
01:32:29,617 --> 01:32:32,720
My name is not Sanchez,
<i>pendeja!</i>

1436
01:32:32,753 --> 01:32:36,557
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1437
01:32:39,293 --> 01:32:41,762
What are you doing?

1438
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,799
Stop him, Carapax.

1439
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,036
Go. I'll be fine.

1440
01:32:52,673 --> 01:32:54,108
Okay, Khaji, come on.

1441
01:32:55,976 --> 01:32:58,112
Okay.
All right, Khaji, activate!

1442
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,346
<i>Rebooting.</i>

1443
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,916
Rebooting? Are you kidding me?

1444
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:06,287
Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1445
01:33:13,661 --> 01:33:15,329
-Go, go, go.
-Okay, okay, okay.

1446
01:33:18,299 --> 01:33:20,801
Milagro, wait.

1447
01:33:20,835 --> 01:33:22,269
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What's wrong? What's wrong?

1448
01:33:22,303 --> 01:33:23,904
No, no, watch out!

1449
01:33:32,046 --> 01:33:33,080
Jenny.

1450
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:35,316
Jenny?

1451
01:33:37,218 --> 01:33:38,352
Jenny!

1452
01:33:45,025 --> 01:33:48,729
Finally, I can feel it.

1453
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:58,038
Oh...

1454
01:33:58,072 --> 01:34:03,077
Now this look really suits you.

1455
01:34:06,814 --> 01:34:09,083
Okay.

1456
01:34:09,116 --> 01:34:11,418
Okay, Khaji.
All right, Khaji-Da.

1457
01:34:11,452 --> 01:34:13,454
You got this. You can do this.

1458
01:34:13,487 --> 01:34:16,257
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1459
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:18,058
<i>Still rebooting.</i>

1460
01:34:18,092 --> 01:34:19,293
Come on!

1461
01:34:36,744 --> 01:34:37,678
Freeze!

1462
01:34:39,514 --> 01:34:41,715
Stay right there!

1463
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:43,884
Come on.

1464
01:34:43,918 --> 01:34:45,019
Don't move.

1465
01:34:47,154 --> 01:34:48,222
Take him down.

1466
01:35:00,935 --> 01:35:01,969
Nana?

1467
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:07,208
Okay.

1468
01:35:07,241 --> 01:35:09,076
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1469
01:35:30,164 --> 01:35:31,198
Keep your eyes
peeled.

1470
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:18,145
Milagro!

1471
01:36:24,619 --> 01:36:27,054
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

1472
01:36:27,087 --> 01:36:30,891
What a mess you have made.

1473
01:36:30,924 --> 01:36:33,093
Let's go.
On your feet. Get up!

1474
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,501

1475
01:36:47,107 --> 01:36:48,309
Yeah.

1476
01:36:48,342 --> 01:36:50,444
Sheez.

1477
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:52,313
- Milagro.
- Where is she?

1478
01:36:52,346 --> 01:36:53,881
Milagro and Jenny.
They're in there.

1479
01:36:53,914 --> 01:36:55,249
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

1480
01:36:55,282 --> 01:36:57,017
Okay, I need to head
back in there, okay?

1481
01:36:57,051 --> 01:36:58,553
Yeah.
What about the suit?

1482
01:36:58,586 --> 01:36:59,587
It's not working right now.
I can't deal with it.

1483
01:36:59,621 --> 01:37:01,155
-Jaime.
-Yes?

1484
01:37:01,188 --> 01:37:03,891
Okay.

1485
01:37:03,924 --> 01:37:06,628
Uh... Rudy, what's that
<i>chongo</i> thing called again?

1486
01:37:06,661 --> 01:37:08,228
Khaji-Da.

1487
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:10,097
Right.

1488
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:12,099
I know you can hear me,
Khaji-Da.

1489
01:37:13,434 --> 01:37:16,036
I want you both
to get it together.

1490
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:18,138
Find your strength, <i>mijito.</i>

1491
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:22,510
Use the pain we're feeling
and turn it into power.

1492
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:24,878
I want you
to go back in there...

1493
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:34,221
I found one of them.

1494
01:37:41,696 --> 01:37:43,297
Sick.

1495
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:45,533
-Drop your weapon.
-Oh, goddamn it.

1496
01:37:56,276 --> 01:37:57,978
Hey! <i>Pendejos!</i>

1497
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,326
<i>Rebooting complete.</i>

-I'm out.
-I'm out.

1500
01:38:16,664 --> 01:38:18,031
You ready Khaji?

1501
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:22,436
Come on, let's get it.

1502
01:38:22,469 --> 01:38:24,104
Who's first?

1503
01:38:31,044 --> 01:38:32,346
Oh, you want some?

1504
01:38:40,187 --> 01:38:41,388
Wait, wait, wait! Watch out!

1505
01:38:41,422 --> 01:38:42,524
Engage the target.

1506
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:50,632
Let's go!

1507
01:39:00,742 --> 01:39:02,309
Oh, man, there's more.

1508
01:39:16,758 --> 01:39:17,725
Grab him!

1509
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:21,261
What the hell?
Get 'em off of me!

1510
01:39:21,295 --> 01:39:22,296
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1511
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:26,568
- Thanks, Khaji.
- De nada.

1512
01:39:27,201 --> 01:39:28,703
Halt!

1513
01:39:28,736 --> 01:39:31,171
<i>One more left.</i>

1514

Come on.

1516
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:46,153
Come on.

1517
01:39:46,186 --> 01:39:47,154
Nice slap.

1518
01:39:54,127 --> 01:39:55,597
Okay, I deserve that one.

1519
01:39:57,565 --> 01:39:59,433
I thought
I'd never see you again.

1520
01:40:02,804 --> 01:40:04,639
I told you I wasn't
going anywhere.

1521
01:40:04,672 --> 01:40:06,508
- Well, you did.
- Yeah, that wasn't my--

1522
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:10,578
Rudy! Rudy!

1523
01:40:10,612 --> 01:40:12,446
Mili, oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1524
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:13,548
You're safe.
I thought I lost you.

1525
01:40:13,581 --> 01:40:15,550
No, no. Look.

1526
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:17,519
Hey, hey, hey.

1527
01:40:17,552 --> 01:40:19,253
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Jenny?

1528
01:40:19,286 --> 01:40:21,255
We got separated. I don't know.

1529
01:40:21,288 --> 01:40:23,257
Okay, we have to find her.

1530
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:24,324
Okay, we're gonna find her
before the others do
because I--

1531
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:25,425
Watch out!

1532
01:40:30,097 --> 01:40:31,331

<i>O.M.A.C. incoming, Jaime.</i>

Ah, crap.

Get off!

1536
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:46,413
Okay, let's do this, Khaji!

1537
01:40:46,446 --> 01:40:47,549
Give me rockets or something.

01:41:05,633 --> 01:41:06,868
Okay,
which way do we go?

1544
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:08,703
Go to the Bug Ship.
It's that way.

1545
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,437
-But where are you going?
-I'm gonna get <i>Cabezon.</i> Go!

Well, I'll scratch yours.

01:41:34,629 --> 01:41:35,663
All right, big boy.

1549
01:41:42,402 --> 01:41:44,171
You do not deserve this power!

1550
01:41:50,712 --> 01:41:51,879
I thought you'd
hit harder than that.

1551
01:41:55,683 --> 01:41:57,785
Okay, we need
something else, Khaji.

1552
01:41:57,819 --> 01:41:59,921
<i>Accessing energy reactor.</i>

01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:11,633
All right,
you wanna dance, huh?

1555
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,166
Now, give me a sword.

1556
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:17,872
So I can make whatever
weapons I want, huh?

1557
01:42:17,905 --> 01:42:21,208
<i>Whatever</i>
<i>you can imagine, I can create.</i>

1566
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:11,458

1571
01:43:29,376 --> 01:43:30,812

01:43:59,941 --> 01:44:02,744
Khaji, Khaji, stay with me.

1575
01:44:02,777 --> 01:44:04,812
You are still
a scared little boy.

1576
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:21,562
I told you,

1577
01:44:21,596 --> 01:44:23,831
the love you feel
for your family...

1578
01:44:23,865 --> 01:44:25,332
makes you weak.

1579
01:44:29,604 --> 01:44:30,905
Hey!

1580
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:35,610
Come on!
Come and get me.

1581
01:44:35,643 --> 01:44:37,410
Come on!

1582
01:44:38,946 --> 01:44:39,847
Rudy.

1583
01:44:41,048 --> 01:44:42,717
Oh, shit.

1584
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:43,618
No!

1585
01:44:44,752 --> 01:44:46,554
Rudy!

1586
01:45:03,838 --> 01:45:07,575
Khaji-Da!

1587
01:45:19,386 --> 01:45:21,689
Your O.M.A.C. has failed.

1588
01:45:21,722 --> 01:45:24,125
Jennifer, you don't know
what the O.M.A.C. is.

1589
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:26,459
Carapax is just a prototype.

1590
01:45:26,493 --> 01:45:28,461
This is the only thing
that's important.

1591
01:45:28,495 --> 01:45:29,897
The Scarab code.

1592
01:45:29,931 --> 01:45:33,433
With this, I can make
a thousand Carapaxes.

1593
01:45:33,466 --> 01:45:35,870
This is the culmination
of my life's work.

1594
01:45:35,903 --> 01:45:41,609
This is the Kord legacy.
This is our legacy.

1595
01:45:41,642 --> 01:45:44,979
Not mine. I'll make sure of it.

1596
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:50,383
You're... you're gonna side
with that Edge Key trash

1597
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:52,385
over your own family?

1598
01:45:54,454 --> 01:45:56,456
That Edge Key trash...

1599
01:45:56,489 --> 01:46:00,695
knows more about
family than you ever will.

1600
01:46:00,728 --> 01:46:03,097
I know. No, I know
about family.

1601
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:07,168
I know about my family
that overlooked me,

1602
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:08,870
just the way that you are now,

1603
01:46:08,903 --> 01:46:11,572
because you are
just like your pathetic father,

1604
01:46:11,606 --> 01:46:14,575
who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

1605
01:46:14,609 --> 01:46:16,544
for the greater good.

1606
01:46:16,577 --> 01:46:20,615
I wish that Ted were here now
to see this.

1607
01:46:24,952 --> 01:46:26,453
Oh!

1608
01:46:53,147 --> 01:46:55,016
No! We're not done!

1609
01:47:01,689 --> 01:47:04,892
<i>Jaime, threat disarmed.</i>

1610
01:47:04,926 --> 01:47:06,827
<i>You're losing control.</i>

1611
01:47:06,861 --> 01:47:09,462
You think
that you could beat me? Huh?

1612
01:47:09,496 --> 01:47:11,966
You should have finished me
when you had the chance!

1613
01:47:15,603 --> 01:47:19,573
<i>O.M.A.C. neutralized.</i>
<i>Recommend to disengage.</i>

1614
01:47:27,048 --> 01:47:28,883
What are you doing?

1615
01:47:28,916 --> 01:47:31,719
<i>We are not killers, Jaime.</i>

1616
01:47:31,752 --> 01:47:33,587
<i>Let him go.</i>

1617
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:35,022
What about Dad?

1618
01:47:36,557 --> 01:47:38,993
What about Rudy?

1619
01:47:39,026 --> 01:47:43,097
<i>During the transfer,</i>
<i>I unlocked his memories.</i>

1620
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:44,765
<i>Let me show you.</i>

1621
01:47:48,936 --> 01:47:51,005
What if he doesn't
survive the procedure?

1622
01:47:51,038 --> 01:47:52,740
Then we'll just
get another one.

1623
01:47:52,773 --> 01:47:54,208
It could kill him.

1624
01:47:54,241 --> 01:47:56,043
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1625
01:47:58,746 --> 01:48:01,182
<i>This country is</i>
<i>confronting a brutal challenge,</i>

1626
01:48:01,215 --> 01:48:03,718
<i>from guerrillas</i>
<i>armed and supported</i>

1627
01:48:03,751 --> 01:48:05,920
<i>by others outside Guatemala.</i>

1628
01:48:05,953 --> 01:48:09,724
<i>The United States</i>
<i>is committed to restoring</i>
<i>democracy</i>

1629
01:48:09,757 --> 01:48:12,893
<i>and to address the root causes</i>
<i>of the violent insurgency.</i>

1630
01:48:12,927 --> 01:48:15,730
<i>We know</i>
<i>about the problems</i>

1631
01:48:15,763 --> 01:48:17,098
<i>confronting Guatemala.</i>

1632
01:48:18,299 --> 01:48:20,500
Perfect. Round them up.

1633
01:48:30,611 --> 01:48:32,947
<i>Mama!</i>

1634
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:35,549
Ignacio!

1635
01:48:56,804 --> 01:48:58,839
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

1636
01:49:10,618 --> 01:49:12,853
Hey! <i>Cabezon!</i>

1637
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,074
You're wrong.

1638
01:50:09,944 --> 01:50:13,347
That love that
I have for my family...

1639
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,352
that's what makes me strong.

1640
01:50:30,297 --> 01:50:32,666
All right, give it to me.
Come on.

1641
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,235
-This?
-Yes, that.

1642
01:50:38,038 --> 01:50:41,809
No!
Now what have you done?

1643
01:50:41,842 --> 01:50:43,377
No! No, no!

1644
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:46,280
Jenny?

1645
01:50:46,313 --> 01:50:48,449
It's okay.

1646
01:50:48,482 --> 01:50:50,284
Carapax, kill them.

1647
01:50:50,317 --> 01:50:51,418
Kill them both!

1648
01:51:03,197 --> 01:51:04,798
Okay.

1649
01:51:04,832 --> 01:51:06,167
What are you doing?
They're getting--

1650
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,234
Okay.

1651
01:51:08,736 --> 01:51:09,436
No.

1652
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:11,038
Wait, Jenny, wait.

1653
01:51:11,071 --> 01:51:12,406
Go back to the Bug Ship.
I'll be right behind you.

1654
01:51:12,439 --> 01:51:14,041
-What?
-I promise.

1655
01:51:14,074 --> 01:51:17,845
We can be partners, huh?

1656
01:51:17,878 --> 01:51:20,714
I'll f... I'll fix it.
I'll fix you.

1657
01:51:20,748 --> 01:51:22,883
We can find another Sanchez.

1658
01:51:26,453 --> 01:51:28,989
Do you remember everything
that I've done for you?

1659
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,701
No.

1660
01:51:42,036 --> 01:51:43,871
Khaji, what's he doing?

1661
01:51:43,904 --> 01:51:45,339
<i>He's maxing out</i>
<i>the energy reactor in his suit.</i>

1662
01:51:45,372 --> 01:51:46,840
<i>I advise we back away.</i>

1663
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:56,083
<i>Ignacio.</i>

1664
01:52:02,557 --> 01:52:04,124
What? What?

1665
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:06,493
What, no! What are you doing?

1666
01:52:06,528 --> 01:52:08,996
Stop! No! No!

1667
01:52:13,067 --> 01:52:16,237
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1668
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:18,072
No! Please! No!

1669
01:52:18,105 --> 01:52:20,441
Ignacio, no! Stop!

1670
01:52:20,474 --> 01:52:22,943
<i>I suggest we run.</i>

1671
01:52:22,977 --> 01:52:24,178
Okay. Oh, shit.

1672
01:52:42,564 --> 01:52:44,198
Milagro, pull!

1673
01:52:53,173 --> 01:52:54,942
Rocio!

1674
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:12,059
You okay?

1675
01:53:14,862 --> 01:53:15,863
Hi.

1676
01:53:35,082 --> 01:53:36,183
Mili.

1677
01:53:38,218 --> 01:53:39,119
<i>Cabezon.</i>

1678
01:53:40,054 --> 01:53:40,921
Rudy?

1679
01:53:42,222 --> 01:53:43,424
Rudy!

1680
01:53:47,895 --> 01:53:49,963
-How?
-Yeah. You know...

1681
01:53:54,234 --> 01:53:55,637
<i>Ama.</i>

1682
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:57,504
Nana.

1683
01:54:29,403 --> 01:54:33,440
<i>It is a delicate moment</i>
<i>for Kord Industries.</i>

1684
01:54:33,474 --> 01:54:37,444
<i>And of course, we mourn</i>
<i>the loss of Victoria Kord.</i>

1685
01:54:37,478 --> 01:54:39,246
<i>But I'm looking forward.</i>

1686
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:42,916
<i>As I was saying,</i>
<i>we will no longer make weapons.</i>

1687
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:46,086
<i>What I want to do is honor</i>
<i>my father's legacy.</i>

1688
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,522
<i>It's not about destruction,</i>

1689
01:54:47,555 --> 01:54:49,456
<i>it's about building</i>
<i>a better future.</i>

1690
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:51,492
<i>It's not about taking</i>
<i>from the community,</i>

1691
01:54:51,526 --> 01:54:52,993
<i>but giving back</i>
<i>to the community.</i>

1692
01:55:03,705 --> 01:55:05,272
What are we gonna do now?

1693
01:55:10,277 --> 01:55:11,646
<i>Animo,</i> Rudy, okay?

1694
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,616
We're gonna get through this,
we always do.

1695
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:18,553
Hey! The Reyes are here.

1696
01:55:19,687 --> 01:55:21,255
Guys.

1697
01:56:18,378 --> 01:56:19,547
Nana.

1698
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:24,552
Okay.

1699
01:56:37,231 --> 01:56:39,233
Where, <i>Ama?</i>
We don't have a house.

1700
01:56:39,266 --> 01:56:41,168
Rudy, we have, like,
half the Edge Keys
in our yard right now.

1701
01:56:41,201 --> 01:56:43,170
I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

1702
01:56:43,203 --> 01:56:44,772
Of course
they're going to help.

1703
01:56:44,806 --> 01:56:47,407
Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

1704
01:56:47,441 --> 01:56:49,142
I wouldn't worry about that.

1705
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:51,779
Jenny, Jenny.

1706
01:56:51,813 --> 01:56:52,714
Hi.

1707
01:56:54,549 --> 01:56:56,551
I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

1708
01:56:56,584 --> 01:56:58,285
to the people
that made it great.

1709
01:56:58,318 --> 01:57:00,454
Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

1710
01:57:00,487 --> 01:57:02,222
on Jenny Kord, no?

1711
01:57:02,256 --> 01:57:03,691
Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

1712
01:57:04,792 --> 01:57:06,393
Starting with you, Rudy.

1713
01:57:06,426 --> 01:57:07,662
Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

1714
01:57:07,695 --> 01:57:09,697
Rudy, I didn't say shit.

1715
01:57:09,731 --> 01:57:11,365
That sounds like something
that you would say to her
to tell me.

1716
01:57:11,398 --> 01:57:13,433
And don't worry,
Kord Industries

1717
01:57:13,467 --> 01:57:15,402
will fix and give you back
your house.

1718
01:57:18,171 --> 01:57:19,807
Excuse me.

1719
01:57:19,841 --> 01:57:21,509
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1720
01:57:21,543 --> 01:57:23,545
-Here, Rudy.
-What's this?

1721
01:57:23,578 --> 01:57:27,180
I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

1722
01:57:30,885 --> 01:57:32,554
How do you like that, cupcake?

1723
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:35,757
Oh! Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

1724
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:37,859
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you."

1725
01:57:37,892 --> 01:57:40,093
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, take a look.

1726
01:57:40,127 --> 01:57:42,195
- Oh, wow.
Come on, help me like it.
- I'm inheriting that.

1727
01:57:44,264 --> 01:57:45,700
All right, I gotta go.

1728
01:57:47,367 --> 01:57:49,102
Yeah.

1729
01:57:49,136 --> 01:57:50,638
How about I walk you out?

1730
01:57:51,639 --> 01:57:53,340
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

1731
01:58:02,282 --> 01:58:03,551
So, uh...

1732
01:58:04,752 --> 01:58:06,320
when am I gonna
see you again?

1733
01:58:06,921 --> 01:58:09,323
Soon. I hope.

1734
01:58:11,224 --> 01:58:12,359
Where are you headed?

1735
01:58:12,927 --> 01:58:14,729
To my dad's.

1736
01:58:14,762 --> 01:58:16,831
I want to look at
my mom's paintings again.

1737
01:58:18,398 --> 01:58:20,668
I forgot how beautiful
they are.

1738
01:58:20,702 --> 01:58:22,469
Cool, cool.

1739
01:58:22,502 --> 01:58:23,538
Uh...

1740
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:27,575
What if I gave you a ride?

1741
01:58:34,549 --> 01:58:35,783
How?

1742
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:37,284
<i>I feel a surge of blood</i>

1743
01:58:37,317 --> 01:58:38,218
<i>rushing towards</i>
<i>your mid-region.</i>

1744
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:39,386
Stop!

1745
01:58:40,622 --> 01:58:41,823
No, no, no. Not you.

1746
01:58:41,856 --> 01:58:42,757
Oh.

1747
01:58:47,494 --> 01:58:48,563
What's it saying?
