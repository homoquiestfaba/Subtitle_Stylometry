1
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:06,314
(gentle, quiet music)

2
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,660
- [Woman] Yes, this is where
everybody hopes to make it big,

3
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,723
the City of Angels, the
place of constant change.

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,850
Of all the businesses here, one represents

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,880
Los Angeles best, a self-storage facility,

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,190
also known as public storage,

7
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,700
where people can store, hide, forget,

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,670
and rediscover the things they own.

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,000
This one here is sitting in Glendale,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,710
between Nebraska and Nixon Boulevards,

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,490
between railroad tracks and freeways,

12
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,840
and, like the hundreds
of others of its kind,

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,040
it stores unclaimed furniture

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,710
of Hollywood divorce
wars, IRS-haunted files,

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,510
forgotten love letters,
aged memories, and junk.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,050
Younger Storage is a family business

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,330
in the 3rd generation,
and some of the customers

18
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,487
come here every single day.

19
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:30,583
This is Roger, one of the
regulars, with his new buck.

20
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,080
This is Jonathan Younger, the owner.

21
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,083
And this is Jay.

22
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,754
Good morning.
- Mm hmm.

23
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:47,848
(gentle, calm music)

24
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,467
- I don't understand why
you think it's so hard.

25
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,301
Number 15 is still not here.

26
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,217
I don't get it, I really don't.

27
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,156
- [Man] Relax.

28
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:45,006
- That's obnoxious.

29
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:46,871
What do you have for 14?

30
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,038
Eric, tell me.

31
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,335
You hear me!

32
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:52,044
- [Eric] Silverware, Honey.

33
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:52,877
- Wrong!

34
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,130
It's the Singer.

35
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,963
- [Eric] What?

36
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,903
- My mother's antique sewing machine.

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,725
- Okay, so the silverware
is in the same box.

38
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,123
- [Honey] Yah.

39
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,540
(calm music)

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,924
- [Jay] Morning, Jonathan.

41
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,968
- Hey, good morning.

42
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:14,801
(Honey shouting indistinctly)

43
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,004
- [Eric] Why didn't you
just mark it on the box?

44
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:22,473
- Me, you said we don't need it.

45
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,883
- Correct.

46
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,435
- [Honey] And now you
don't know what's in it.

47
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,268
- I know.

48
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:29,423
- Okay, so tell me.

49
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,593
- Cross country skies.

50
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:35,680
- (laughs) I'll tell you what's in there.

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,354
The rifle, the big umbrella,

52
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,372
and the Italian pizza cutter.

53
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:41,586
- [Eric] 27 is the skies.

54
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,092
- [Honey] Who cares?

55
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,413
You can't keep your balance on it

56
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:45,968
for two seconds anyway!

57
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:46,801
- [Eric] Honey, please.

58
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:47,665
I don't feel-

59
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:48,498
- Last time, when kids go,

60
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:50,773
you almost kill Sonya
simply carrying them.

61
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,093
- Well, your last pizza almost
killed the whole family.

62
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,250
- If you're having any
trouble with this facility,

63
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,440
I should be more than happy to rectify

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
any problems whatever.

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,620
- No, sir, not at all.
- He just doesn't get it.

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,453
Never.

67
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:04,550
- It's just the situation.

68
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,830
- Roger, good morning!

69
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,570
Rabbits still rabbiting, are they?

70
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,010
- Yeah, look!

71
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,960
- Jonathan Younger.

72
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,973
I know exactly what you're
going through, madam.

73
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:16,270
I see it every day, and I
want you to rest assured

74
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,220
that not one single
blessed item shall be lost.

75
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,290
Everything will be found.

76
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,280
You travel with the best
movers I know in the business,

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,260
and, believe me, I know them all.

78
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,223
All right?
- Yeah.

79
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:28,050
- I don't want you upset.

80
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,800
This is my place, and I
want you to feel happy here.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

82
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,270
- You're German, yes?

83
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,221
Your accent tells me.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,588
(speaking foreign language)

85
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:40,470
- Oktoberfest.

86
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,041
- Yes, sir!

87
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,874
- Oktoberfest.

88
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,570
Well, well, well.

89
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,880
I, too, am an immigrant of sorts.

90
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,550
Long, long time ago, of course.

91
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,383
The old country.

92
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,330
And I'm here to tell you,
you won't regret your choice.

93
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,810
I've had a dreadful crush on
Los Angeles all these years.

94
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,360
It never ceases to excite me.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,293
Even now, it thrills me, just thrills me.

96
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,250
If, perchance, you find
you need more space

97
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,590
than you'd anticipated on, I want you

98
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,458
to take advantage of my
owner's special, all right?

99
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:17,182
For certain clients, I provide
a little complimentary space.

100
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,765
(gentle music)

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,604
(grunting)

102
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:28,084
(gentle music)

103
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:30,584
(phone rings)

104
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,643
- Storage.

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,013
No, no, no, I'm Mrs. Younger.

106
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:42,631
Yes, I am the bookkeeper, yes.

107
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:44,048
Penelope Younger.

108
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,041
Yes.

109
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:48,560
My husband?

110
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,551
- Haven't had my breakfast.

111
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,717
- He's not here right now.

112
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,286
Okay, thank you.

113
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,080
- Who was that?

114
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,913
- IRS.

115
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,070
- Good morning, Penelope.

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,913
Anything new?

117
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,275
- [Penelope] Tax return due this week.

118
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:15,623
- I mean anything important.

119
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:16,831
- [Penelope] No.

120
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,900
- No, I have some things for you that are.

121
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,230
This needs a new battery.

122
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,280
My sink still needs a plumber.

123
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,670
And I do prefer my shirts on hangers,

124
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,773
not folded, as they were the
last time, as you well know.

125
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,425
So, if that's it, I'm off to breakfast.

126
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,080
Oh, for Winston's
graduation, double his check,

127
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,957
and remind me to sign it.

128
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:39,540
What a brilliant woman you are!

129
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,179
(quiet music)

130
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,084
(traffic hums)

131
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:05,240
- Thank you very much, ladies.

132
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,740
You have a nice day now, here?

133
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,418
- Thank you, Melodie, put on your glasses.

134
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:11,251
- Bye.

135
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:14,947
Oh my God, did you see that?

136
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:17,947
(people chattering)

137
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,675
They came to get coffee to go in my place.

138
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:27,052
- Morning, all!

139
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:30,083
- I can't believe it, I
just can't believe it!

140
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,566
What was she doing in the Valley?

141
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,566
(people chattering)

142
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,261
Did you see her?

143
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,094
- [Jonathan] Did I see whom?

144
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:38,923
- Oh, you wouldn't believe it.

145
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,420
- Margaret Thatcher?

146
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,860
The Duchess of York?

147
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,370
- [Man] You'll never guess.

148
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,053
- How about ZigZag Lilian?

149
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,017
(bell rings)

150
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,430
- Two locks.

151
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,390
This is yours.

152
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,260
You don't pay, I hang
mine in the second hole.

153
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,093
- Oh, that's smart.

154
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:05,130
- You don't pay for a full
quarter, I cut yours off

155
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,230
and leave mine until your
things are auctioned off.

156
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,170
- That's fine with me.

157
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,873
- You pay for both, no refunds.

158
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,800
- Any other sanctions, babe?

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,750
- I need insurance.

160
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,690
- What have you got?

161
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,640
- What do you need?

162
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,663
- 500 and I'll think about it.

163
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,847
- Nice skirt, love.

164
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,051
- Thanks, Grandpa.

165
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:29,958
(bell rings)

166
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,791
- Good morning, Jonathan.

167
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,413
- [Jonathan] Good morning, Frances.

168
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,501
- [Frances] Are you enjoying yourself?

169
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:36,850
- [Jonathan] Absolutely.

170
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,683
(Frances chuckles)

171
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,050
- Thank you, deary.

172
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,829
Melodie, put on your glasses.

173
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:41,787
- Mother.

174
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,000
(grunting)

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,970
- God, what is this, pet's heaven?

176
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,060
- Mother.

177
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,893
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:51,811
- Put your glasses on.

179
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,080
(people chattering)

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,663
- [Man] Newspapers?

181
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,127
- What do we have here, a mutiny?

182
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,869
- Jonathan, you wouldn't believe it.

183
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:11,702
- [Jonathan] Believe what, Benjamin?

184
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:13,640
- [Benjamin] Who just walked outta here.

185
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,633
- ZigZag Lilian.

186
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,860
- You see her, too?

187
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,080
- Oh, come on, you just got here!

188
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,231
- You're joking!
- Jonathan, she just

189
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,470
walked out.
- Oh!

190
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,380
- You mean you didn't see her?

191
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,043
- No.
- Well, how do you know then?

192
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:30,670
- Because I just missed seeing
them at the coffee shop.

193
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,810
- They walked out, you walked in.

194
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,473
- That's enough, everybody out.

195
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,403
Come on, out!

196
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,300
(bell rings)

197
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,206
That's enough!

198
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,071
Out!

199
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,537
(people chattering)

200
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,556
- I can't hear my music.
- Outside, outside.

201
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,357
- Who is this ZigZag woman?

202
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:47,601
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

203
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:48,538
- They put her in the paper

204
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:49,780
every day.
- Jonathan, could you lock

205
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,540
me in, please?

206
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,853
- Yes, of course, love.

207
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:56,353
(quiet music)

208
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,703
- Thank you, Jonathan.

209
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,793
Don't you forget to let me out

210
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,816
at 5:30.
- At 5:30.

211
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,399
(door rattles)

212
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,244
What was your lot number again?

213
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:27,994
- You.
- Just kidding.

214
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,303
- Are you lost?

215
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:44,212
(woman shouts)

216
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:45,045
Whoops!

217
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:47,599
- Thanks!

218
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:49,330
My china!

219
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,937
(lights click)

220
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:56,604
(magical music)

221
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:16,373
(timer buzzes)

222
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:17,400
- Terribly sorry about that.

223
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,087
We're conserving energy.

224
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,860
Johnathan Younger.

225
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,457
I own this establishment.

226
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,570
- Oh, my pleasure.

227
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,403
I'm Norma.

228
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,720
I can't find my unit.

229
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,130
- What's the number?

230
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,963
- 72.

231
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,180
- 72 on the street?

232
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,013
- You mean?

233
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
- That's Piccadilly.

234
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,933
This is Lambeth Walk.

235
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,553
Here, you hold on to
this and I'll haul this.

236
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,010
I hope that when you're
properly stored away,

237
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,420
you'll allow me the pleasure
of showing you my organ.

238
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,020
- What?
- Now, you saucy thing,

239
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,710
my Wurlitzer.

240
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,960
(grunting)

241
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:12,847
(quiet music)

242
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,530
- We lost everything.

243
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,690
The house, the money, even my friends!

244
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,080
- Friends?

245
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,606
Be reasonable, Melodie.

246
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,170
- Reasonable?

247
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,863
They think I've been accused of murder.

248
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,300
- I'm the one accused of murder.

249
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,843
Now get that Van Gogh stored.

250
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,133
Pronto!

251
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
- Excuse me.

252
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,483
Hello, Auntie E.

253
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,892
Positively blinding today.

254
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,475
(timer buzzes)

255
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,123

256
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:37,376
(timer buzzes)

257
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:39,270
Are you all right, child?

258
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,103
- Yes, sir.

259
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,803
- You sure?

260
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,520
- [Melodie] Sure.

261
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,961
- All right.

262
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,544
(timer buzzes)

263
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,993
I bet I can cheer you up.

264
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,830
It's just around the corner.

265
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,900
Down Hay Market, up three steps,

266
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,880
and across the bridge.

267
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,823
It's very easy.

268
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,230
I'll leave the door open.

269
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,510
I hope you come.

270
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,232
(timer buzzes)

271
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,635
(playful organ music)

272
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,809
- Everything all right, Penny?

273
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,976
(playful organ music)

274
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,371
(grunting)
(clattering)

275
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:11,538
(playful organ music)

276
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,215
(door creaks)

277
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,346
- Sit down, my dear.

278
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:41,215
(timer buzzes)

279
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,586
(timer clicks)

280
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:57,099
(playful organ music)

281
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:36,840
- Could you page my daughter out there?

282
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,333
- [Penny] Why don't you go and get her?

283
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,280
- Because I don't like
dark corridors, my dear.

284
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,710
You feeling all right, honey?

285
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,543
You look-

286
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,482
- How?

287
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,752
- Sick.

288
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,714
- It's the heart.

289
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,880
- At your age, you shouldn't
work so hard, darling.

290
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,325
- It's not the work.

291
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,492
(playful organ music)

292
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,900
(spoon rattles)

293
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,324
(phone rings)

294
00:17:51,677 --> 00:17:52,510
Storage.

295
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,553
Winston, hello, dear.

296
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:56,550
- [Winston] I didn't get my check yet.

297
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,483
- I'm sending your check today.

298
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,631
So tell me, how are you doing?

299
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,460
Well, your grades haven't been that good.

300
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,211
Do you really think you deserve?

301
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:09,330
- [Winston] Of course I deserve it.

302
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,620
Can you put Dad on, please?

303
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,285
- Sure, your father's here.

304
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,963
- [Winston] Thank you.

305
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,220
- Mm hmm, hold on one moment.

306
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,345
Jonathan.

307
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,499
- [Jonathan] You feel better now?

308
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,760
- Thank you so much, I-

309
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,713
- No, no, it is not me.

310
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,003
It's the music.

311
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,660
- [Penny] Jonathan, Winston line two.

312
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,493
- That's my son.

313
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:27,326
You will excuse me?

314
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:29,040
He's calling from England.

315
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,093
He's in college, a business major.

316
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,793
Bye.

317
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:34,313
- Bye, thanks, Mr. Younger.

318
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,470
- No Cs, no Ds, just As for
my only beloved son, right?

319
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,440
Hello, boy, how's the fog?

320
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,640
- It's foggy, all right.

321
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,193
Oh, Daddy.

322
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:50,263
I miss you so much.

323
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,122
- Well, I miss you, too.

324
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:56,539
- [Winston] I wish that I
could just drop everything.

325
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,163
- Poor boy.

326
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:00,996
- Daddy.

327
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,376
I need more money.

328
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,541
- Just tell me, how much?

329
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,823
- [Winston] Everything's so expensive.

330
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:09,173
- I know, I know.

331
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,080
Bloody inflation everywhere.

332
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,208
- No, the invitation.

333
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,198
- [Jonathan] The invitation.

334
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,020
Oh, for your graduation party.

335
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,385
- Yes, I don't wanna look cheap.

336
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,418
- A Younger?

337
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:21,331
Never!

338
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,500
Give them champagne.

339
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,930
- Thanks, Dad, you're wonderful.

340
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,410
- Ah, no, Winston, you're wonderful!

341
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,493
And you will be wonderful.

342
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,820
Have you finished your exams yet?

343
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,163
- [Winston] I've got two more to go.

344
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:33,458
- How many As so far?

345
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,625
(hissing)

346
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:38,508
Winston!

347
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:39,843
(hissing)

348
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:40,676
Winston!

349
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:43,400
(phone slams)

350
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,563
Antiquated English telephone systems.

351
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:50,789
(woman whispering foreign language)

352
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:58,830
Just talked to Winston in London!

353
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,723
What a talent.

354
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:01,230
What a Younger.

355
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,130
Oh, he's gonna make it big, that boy.

356
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,230
He's really something.

357
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:07,830
- [Roger] Look at him,
he's really something.

358
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,439
It's his 15th time this morning.

359
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:15,400
- You know, Roger, in a couple of weeks,

360
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,780
he and I are going to
start working together.

361
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,063
Father and son, building an empire,

362
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:24,001
a self-storage chain
stretching across the country.

363
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,751
Younger Self-Storage.

364
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,514
Younger and Son, Younger and Younger.

365
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:30,471
Younger and Younger!

366
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:31,550
- Yeah.
- Younger and Younger!

367
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,593
Roger, a new sign, before
he arrives, a new sign!

368
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:39,085
(quiet, peaceful music)

369
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,770
- Hi, Mr. Younger.

370
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:56,245
(calm music)

371
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,647
- ZigZag Lilian was here today.

372
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:02,587
- What?

373
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:06,056
- And her daughter Melodie.

374
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,889
- Wow.

375
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,777
- Wow, indeed.

376
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,311
- "All help came too late.

377
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:16,407
"Max was dead."

378
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:20,714
- What are you around about?

379
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:24,123
Go on, come on, get outta here.

380
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:26,290
(snoring)

381
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:30,251
(quiet music)

382
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,450
- They were back.

383
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,760
- [Jonathan] Who was back?

384
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,060
- ZigZag and Melodie,
while you were sleeping.

385
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,349
- Penny!

386
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:55,238
All right, Penelope, this time (shouting).

387
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:58,030
What am I around here, bloody nothing?

388
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,530
No, don't try that trick
because it won't work.

389
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,719
We had an important,
an important customer!

390
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,487
- Shh!
- And you didn't wake me!

391
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,900
Why, Penelope, why?
- Shh!

392
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,220
Tax return's due tomorrow.

393
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,340
- The hell with your bloody tax return!

394
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,820
Can't you get it through your skull

395
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,000
what's important in our business?

396
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,110
It's human relationships.

397
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,960
All you're concerned about is adding up

398
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,207
your lousy, cheap, little
(shouting indistinctly).

399
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,277
(phone rings)

400
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:27,916
- Storage.

401
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:28,749
How many?

402
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:31,253
Confirmed, 41 to 47.

403
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:34,676
96.

404
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,917
(Jonathan sighs)

405
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,053
- Winston's check, please.

406
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,350
- [Penelope] It's doubled.

407
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,183
- Treble it.

408
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,124
Why, Penelope, why?

409
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,913
Why did you choose not to wake me?

410
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,383
- Your siesta.

411
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,661
Remember the last time?

412
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:11,445
- You know what I think?

413
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:13,112
I think you hate me.

414
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,750
You think I married you just to get

415
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,690
my green card, don't you?

416
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,140
You think I married you just to get

417
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,020
into your parents'
business here, don't you?

418
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,960
That's what's been stewing
in that brain of yours,

419
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,080
and now you're taking your revenge

420
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,333
after 25 years of marriage!

421
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,103
- 26.

422
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,493
- I have a little surprise
for you, Penelope.

423
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,073
I want a new sign.

424
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,113
25 foot by 12.

425
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:46,467
It should read "Younger and Younger,

426
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,967
"The Discreet Self-Storage."

427
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,870
Winston and I are going to take this mess

428
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,710
and turn it into a lucrative,
elegant establishment,

429
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,500
where important customers are treated

430
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,800
with the kind of respect they deserve.

431
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,483
- We can't afford it.

432
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,853
- That's my decision.

433
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,533
- I won't order it.

434
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,753
- You won't order it?

435
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:16,294
You won't order it?

436
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,315
You won't order it?

437
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,133
You won't order it?

438
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,041
(gun bangs)

439
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,810
(banging)

440
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,933
My organ!

441
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,233
You shot my organ!

442
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,860
That's the last time, Penelope!

443
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,250
I'm out, I'm gone, where are my keys?

444
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,460
Where are my bloody keys?

445
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,860
- [Penny] Where they belong.

446
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:46,790
(Jonathan shouts)

447
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,623
- Jonathan!

448
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,036
- Jonathan!

449
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:51,964
You forgot to open up Frances.

450
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:54,680
- Not me, Penny's in charge now!

451
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:58,121
(sad music)

452
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,100
(lift whines)

453
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,926
(motorcycles rumbles)

454
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:18,349
(horn honks)

455
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:21,039
(men shout)

456
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,622
(timer buzzes)

457
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,560
- Did you kill him this time?

458
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,120
- No, but I should have.

459
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,730
- [Frances] Well, maybe next time.

460
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:42,825
- Frances.

461
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:46,544
(timer buzzes)

462
00:26:58,735 --> 00:27:01,818
(Motorcycle rumbles)

463
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:08,557
(horn honks)

464
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:10,990
- 9:15 at the Serenade, on the money.

465
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,550
Hope you're all having a good old time.

466
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,540
Sweet dance the night away.

467
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,153

Hello, hello.

506
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,610
- [Frances] Jonathan,
how about letting me in?

507
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,413
- You're coming in early.

508
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:35,820
- Seen this yet?

509
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,693
ZigZag trial, blood on the skateboard.

510
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,083

- Morning, Jay.

(laughing)

512
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:51,245
- Wait, seven again?

513
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:56,290
No, no, okay, okay, so, like, every time

514
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,850
he kind alike makes you angry,

515
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,520
and then he like totally won't stop,

516
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,363
you just shoot his organ?

517
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:07,470
- No, no, no.
- Oh!

518
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,503
Oh my God!

519
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,086
I don't believe it.

520
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:16,680
I mean, you were always
like the shiest little thing

521
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,420
in school, even the day you got married.

522
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,650
- I remember that day so well.

523
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,580
You and your polka dot
petticoat and Howard Schlitzman.

524
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,501
Are you still with him?

525
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,251
- Oh, no, oh, please!

526
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,730
Howard was more like a one night stand.

527
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,683
Actually, he was more
like a one night standby.

528
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:40,997
Bye.

529
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:44,176
(chuckling)

530
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,317
Oh, but you, married 26 years to, like,

531
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,663
the totally hottest man in town.

532
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:59,126
Jonathan, whoa.

533
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:03,126
So, Penny, tell me, come
on, what's your secret?

534
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,135
(blower whines)

535
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,798
- Why don't I show you around?

536
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:22,833
We're still as old-fashioned

537
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,422
as when my parents still ran this place.

538
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:28,089
(blower whines)

539
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:42,065
- Morning, Penelope.

540
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:52,017
Hello, Sue, long time no see.

541
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:56,550
- Hi.

542
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,843
Whoa!

543
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,400
- [Penny] Battery's replaced.

544
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,166
- Glad to see you haven't
changed, Jonathan.

545
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,583
You still got it.

546
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:40,373
- [Jonathan] Let me show you around.

547
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:43,658
- [Sue] See you later, Penny!

548
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,750
(Sue shouts and giggles)

549
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,466
Whoa! (giggles)

550
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:11,833
Whoa! (giggles)

551
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:18,331
(organ clangs)

552
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,820
(Sue shouts)

553
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,820
(organ clangs)
(Sue shouts)

554
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:55,814
(Penny gasps)

555
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:15,734
- Jonathan.

556
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:21,876
Jonathan!

557
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:22,709
Jonathan!

558
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:27,047
Jonathan, Penny's knocked out!

559
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:31,962
Penny's knocked out!

560
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:33,592
Jonathan!

561
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:36,455
- Hey, Penny!

562
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,679
Oh my God!
- Penny.

563
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,268
- Penny, Penny!
- Knocked out!

564
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:42,108
- [Benjamin] Penny!

565
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,125
I have no pulse.

566
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,336
I have no pulse!

567
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,124
- Penny, Penny.
- Oh my god, I have no pulse!

568
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,659
Penny, breathe, breathe, breathe!

569
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:53,345
- [Woman] Penny.

570
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,734
- [Benjamin] Penny!

571
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:55,567
Penny!

572
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:59,344
(Sue shouts)

573
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:03,507
I need help!

574
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:05,879
I need help here!

575
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:08,764
Penny, breathe, breathe!

576
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:42,210
(droning ambient music)

577
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,126
- [Announcer] L-T-7,
please remove your car

578
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:54,092
to the main entrance.

579
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:56,675
- [Woman] That's me, that's me!

580
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:02,500
(shouting)
(chattering)

581
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,376
- Finally!

582
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:16,272
- [Jonathan] You and me, together at last.

583
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:18,400
Me and you forever!

584
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,650
(laughing)

585
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,928
(Jonathan cries)

586
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,553
- My father's not wearing a white suit.

587
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:30,509
- I didn't want to hurt your feelings

588
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:35,509
because of your mother's funeral. (cries)

589
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,817
- Someone took my cart.

590
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:43,826
- Officer!

591
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:52,462
(calm, playful music)

592
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:11,553
(Winston yawns)

593
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:14,393
It's a far, far better
place that she's in now.

594
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,407
- I'm sorry, Dad, it's jet lag.

595
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:19,445
- That's all right.

596
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:22,945
(graceful, playful music)

597
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,333
Welcome home, Mr. Younger II.

598
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:40,250
- Mother?

599
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,723
I dreamt she was back.

600
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:44,037
- Mother?

601
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,530
It's all right, I'm here for you now.

602
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,090
After you have some rest,
I have a surprise for you.

603
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,226
Driver, put that on the
lift over there, will you?

604
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:57,171
- [Driver] Sure thing, Pop.

605
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,917
(shattering)

606
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,722
- [Winston] I'm not going
to trip on anything, am I?

607
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:01,711
- Turn around.

608
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:05,011
Now you can take your hands down.

609
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:05,952
Okay, on the count of three.

610
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:07,785
One, two, three, pull!

611
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:13,748
(laughing)

612
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:17,381
- [Winston] Dad, this is a big sign!

613
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,705
Dad!

614
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:20,922
- Partners!
- No, this is too much!

615
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:23,133
- Too much, it's just the beginning.

616
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:24,267
This is the prototype.

617
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,217
They're going to be all over the world.

618
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,920
Where do you wanna eat, your choice.

619
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,070
- I don't know, I'm kinda-

620
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,620
- Tired, I'll order pizza.

621
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,380
Chicago deep dish okay?

622
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,142
- Okay.
- Extra cheese?

623
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:41,975
- Yeah.

624
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,540
- Jonathan Younger, Chicago
deep dish, extra large.

625
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,433
Extra cheese.

626
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,733
Green peppers, sausage.

627
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,943
1635 Nebraska.

628
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,893
That's three blocks east of Nixon.

629
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,603
Great, thanks.

630
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:09,741
- [Announcer] The ZigZag trial

631
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:11,330
at the Beverley Hills town court.

632
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,960
Donna Vetter reports.

633
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,800
- Former best-dressed
man of Beverley Hills,

634
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,760
Max Beerbrower, was
ready for his usual visit

635
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,620
to Chastan's Bar and Grill,

636
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,790
but, this evening, he would never arrive.

637
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,043
His wife Lilian, the former well-known

638
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:26,996
(speaker drowned out).
- Do you know who

639
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:28,776
ZigZag Lilian is?
- One of our customers.

640
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:30,420
- [Donna] Are accused of
preparing a deathtrap.

641
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,019
- How did you know that?
- For the real estate

642
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:32,852
tycoon Max.

643
00:41:32,852 --> 00:41:35,290
We tried to reconstruct the crime.

644
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,500
Melodie places a skateboard at the top

645
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,960
of the staircase.

646
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,370
Lilian howls over a killer migraine.

647
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,800
Max exits the powder
room to stand by Lilian.

648
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,270
He's at the gallery when Lilian appears,

649
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,673
yelling for a martini.

650
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,330
Max rushes to the stairs.

651
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,550
Lilian calls him back, her
head pounding with pain.

652
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,450
He turns and steps onto the skateboard,

653
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,600
which catapults him an
unbelievable six feet

654
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,650
into the air and over the rail

655
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,120
in an acrobatic backwards flip.

656
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,900
He lands in front of
Melodie on the marble floor,

657
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,420
his head cracked open.
(Jonathan laughs)

658
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,200
At a press conference, Lilian stated

659
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,630
that she recalled nothing but zigzags,

660
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,780
which experts describe as
a typical migraine feature.

661
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,720
The irony is Max Beerbrower
had lost his entire fortune

662
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,713
in a huge speculation fraud
only hours before his death.

663
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,133
Accident or murder?

664
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,193
You decide.

665
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,490
- It's an exciting business, Winston.

666
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,323
People from all walks of life
come through these doors,

667
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,513
taking shelter, sheltering secrets.

668
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,820
But the most amazing, most exciting,

669
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,403
the most thrilling thing is
the constant stream of women.

670
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,297
You never have to go out
to look for a pretty girl.

671
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:53,450
You're like a big fish in the ocean.

672
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,783
You just open your mouth
and the plankton drifts in.

673
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:03,710
You're like a hunter who
never goes into the woods

674
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,230
because your prey comes
into your backyard.

675
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:09,926
(Winston snores)

676
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:14,575
Oh, Winston.

677
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:17,495
My sunshine.

678
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:20,424
The apple of my eye.

679
00:43:21,578 --> 00:43:22,661
Welcome home.

680
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,153
It's five past nine, Johnny boy.

681
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,775
I think Daddy deserves a
little West Coast swim.

682
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:33,330
What do you think?

683
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,497
(Winston snores)
Good.

684
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:41,170
Okay, there you go.

685
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,251
There you go, baby.

686
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,751
(tense music)

687
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:53,180
(gentle music)

688
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:10,317
It's time to start getting it out there.

689
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,301
Girls, girls, girls.

690
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:20,283
- Oh, the Wurlitzer, it's yours?

691
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,883
But I thought that we.

692
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:25,730
I don't.
- Hey, Roger, Winston's home.

693
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,451
- See, I just arrive
from college yesterday.

694
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:29,350
- Yeah, I know.

695
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,449
- I don't know.
- How's you bun today?

696
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:31,410
- [Roger] World record.

697
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,310
- [Winston] I'll have my dad call you.

698
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,630
- So how was your first night home?

699
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,090
- Good, I was up at four this morning.

700
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,623
I walked around a little bit.

701
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:44,100
I had breakfast at the corner cafe.

702
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,260
Said hi to Roger.

703
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,380
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah, of course.

704
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,500
- Self-storage management,
lesson number one,

705
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,200
rent out space.

706
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,943
Lesson number two, get
cash before they leave.

707
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,763
Lesson number three,
deposit cash in the bank.

708
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,706
- Ah, a board meeting.

709
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:08,780
- A board meeting.
- Yes!

710
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,240
- So there's not even a
typewriter around here.

711
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,543
How did you manage to type?
- You knew your mother.

712
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,870
She was so old-fashioned.

713
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,710
She made such a fuss about her receipts

714
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,243
and her files and her handwritten papers.

715
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,253
After she was gone, I tried
to straighten things up,

716
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,523
but I couldn't.

717
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:43,205
- Well, what we need is a computer.

718
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:45,180
- Oh, a computer?

719
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,680
I knew the money I
spent for your education

720
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,513
wasn't wasted.

721
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,080
All you have to do is write
out a couple of checks.

722
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,670
The income tax return that I mailed

723
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,124
came back marked "incomplete."

724
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:57,250
- It did?
- Yeah.

725
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,505
But that won't be a problem

726
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,138
for my new business partner, will it?

727
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:04,143
All I need is my newspaper
and my weekly cash.

728
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:07,963
Penny.

729
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Penny used to do that for me.

730
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,393
- Oh.

731
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,823
- [Woman] Hi, Mr. Younger.

732
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,323
- Hi.

733
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,493
Plankton.

734
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:33,877
- I've got a house on Duncan, Jonathan.

735
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:36,260
Our house is in perfect
condition right away.

736
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,907
So I want to find my
(speaking foreign language).

737
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:42,668
- Your blankets?

738
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:43,970
- Yeah, exactly.

739
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,370
Let's see, and I need
the towels and the forks.

740
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,081
The spoons.

741
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:51,914
- Cutlery, silverware.

742
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:53,800
- No, we don't have silver.

743
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,947
Only normal.

744
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,953
Let's see.

745
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:00,096
Right here, no.

746
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:01,429
Okay, number 25.

747
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:03,300
This, no.

748
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:05,873
- Jonathan.
(squeaking)

749
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:06,941
- Penny!

750
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:07,938
(squeaking)

751
00:47:07,938 --> 00:47:09,565
(shouting)

752
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:11,065
- Oh, Mr. Younger!

753
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,370
Oh, no, oh, no, Mr. Younger.

754
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,326
- [Jonathan] I don't
want to hurt anything.

755
00:47:18,326 --> 00:47:19,159
- Oh, no.

756
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:21,951
Are you all right, Mr. Younger?

757
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:23,076
- Yes, of course.

758
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:23,993
Absolutely.

759
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:29,204
- Oh, careful!
- Father?

760
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:31,621
- It's just customer service.

761
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,963
- I just got a call.

762
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,290
The check for the new sign bounced.

763
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:44,393
- That's not possible.

764
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,833
How much was it?

765
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,049
- You don't know?

766
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:53,882
- No.

767
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:55,397
- 13,900.

768
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,452
(Penelope giggles)

769
00:48:00,452 --> 00:48:03,790
- For the sad reason
that you're all aware of,

770
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,790
I was not able to attend
my son's graduation,

771
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,350
but I did, at least, want to see him

772
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,470
in his cap and gown and
share that with you,

773
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:19,120
so, if I may propose a toast

774
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:23,690
to the first Younger ever
with a college degree,

775
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,593
Winston Churchill Younger!

776
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:30,163
- Hooray!
(shouting)

777
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:32,107
- [Jonathan] Hooray!

778
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:33,379
- My buck!

779
00:48:33,379 --> 00:48:34,566
My buck!

780
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:36,205
Oh, fuck, my buck!

781
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,455
(shouting)

782
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,623
Catch him, get him.

783
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:46,456
Over here!

784
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,933
- [Jonathan] That's enough, get out!

785
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,580
- Did you complete the tax return, dear?

786
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,683
- Oh, the Wurlitzer.

787
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,467
I forgot to tell him.

788
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:23,680
I'm sorry, I'll call you.
- Morning, partner!

789
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,343
Rabbits, rabbits are not
allowed in the office.

790
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:33,191
Bravo!

791
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:35,810
And my weekly cash?

792
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,560
- I've started to look up
things in my textbooks,

793
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,190
but most of it doesn't really apply.

794
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,200
- [Jonathan] That's no
problem, take your time.

795
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,870
- Well, see, I made a list of everything

796
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,653
that I need to know from you.

797
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,120
- Have you had breakfast yet?

798
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,953
- [Winston] Yes.

799
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,240
- Good, good, well, I'm
gonna go and get mine.

800
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,670
Did you get the income
tax returns completed?

801
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,476
- No, Dad, I need to talk to you.

802
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:00,309
- Yes.

803
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,083
Yes, yes, yes.

804
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,523
- It's darn hot in here.

805
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:25,694
- Keep it, keep it.

806
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,303
- Winston?

807
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,723
Would you lock me in, please?

808
00:50:39,723 --> 00:50:41,556
- [Winston] Of course.

809
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:07,352
- Penny, are you there?

810
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,213
(mysterious, plucking music)

811
00:51:27,815 --> 00:51:32,815
(shouting)
(chattering)

812
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,207
- It's ruined, it's ruined!

813
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:36,457
(shouting)

814
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:49,871
- Good morning, Jay.

815
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:52,121
(shouting)

816
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:55,717
- Something's wrong.

817
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:58,134
(calm music)

818
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:14,099
- Excuse me, excuse me.

819
00:52:15,957 --> 00:52:16,790
- [Frances] Who is it?

820
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,210
- It's me Winston, can I talk to you?

821
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,653
- [Frances] Well, you
have my lock combination.

822
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,090
(mysterious music)

823
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,903
- He won't show me anything.

824
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,210
I have a list, a fine list, of things

825
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,220
that need to be done, questions,

826
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,710
but he just always slips away.

827
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,218
I mean, he could explain it to me.

828
00:52:50,218 --> 00:52:51,080
- You think he could?

829
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,690
- Of course.

830
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,640
I'm here, I am willing to do it,

831
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,940
he did it all those
years, he did a great job.

832
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:01,153
I don't know, maybe he's
afraid to pass it along.

833
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,410
I don't get it.

834
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,520
He thinks that because I went to college

835
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,840
that I know everything
that I need to know,

836
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,600
but, don't tell anybody, but
I wasn't an A student, okay?

837
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,340
I wasn't that bad, either,
but that stuff is all theory.

838
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,313
He has the experience, I don't.

839
00:53:22,092 --> 00:53:26,259
- Winston, you think that
Jonathan ran this place?

840
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:35,884
- Can I come closer?

841
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,580
(magical music)

842
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,273
- Mother?

843
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,528
- Yes, Winston.

844
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:12,990
Well, he did the show,
and she did the work.

845
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:20,440
- Mother did everything.

846
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,610
I can't believe he blinded me

847
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,863
with that white suit all these years.

848
00:54:25,857 --> 00:54:28,524
- "Blinded with his white suit."

849
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,273
- What?

850
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,672
- You just helped me out another time.

851
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:39,545
- How come?

852
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:40,941
(chuckling)

853
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:44,050
- When you were a boy
and you used to visit me,

854
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,900
you always had to know
how the story continued.

855
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,412
- That's true.

856
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:52,630
- And maybe I was stuck,
but I had to tell you

857
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,740
because I couldn't disappoint you.

858
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,650
You had to have your story.

859
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,280
So, today, I've been stuck with this

860
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,300
mother-daughter relationship.

861
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,970
- ZigZag Lilian and...

862
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,053
What's her name again?

863
00:55:08,053 --> 00:55:09,287
- Melodie.

864
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:11,954
(magical music)

865
00:55:18,684 --> 00:55:22,341
- You can think of me,
but you can't touch me.

866
00:55:22,341 --> 00:55:25,674
(magical ambient music)

867
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,898
- [Jonathan] Lilian.

868
00:55:38,123 --> 00:55:39,789
- [Man Under Hood] This thing here.

869
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:40,733
That's the problem.

870
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,433
It just overheated a little bit.

871
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,270
Just let the car sit for a little while.

872
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,463
Come on inside.

873
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:51,567
Have a coffee or something.

874
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,230
- [Winston] We need to talk!

875
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:58,087
- Let me wake up first.

876
00:55:58,087 --> 00:55:59,673
- Right, right, you need to wake up!

877
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:02,160
This is not going to continue!

878
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,440
No more three hour cat naps.

879
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,273
- What?

880
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:06,463
- I am not Penny.

881
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,040
I am not your slave!

882
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,960
I am your son, I need a partner.

883
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,610
If it's not going to be you,
it will be someone else!

884
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:15,790
- Oh, sonny boy.

885
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,263
- Don't you sonny boy me!

886
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,843
- Not in public, Winston.

887
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:23,687
- You never (groans).

888
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,330
- Too embarrassing.

889
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,632
- Embarrassing, embarrassing?

890
00:56:31,632 --> 00:56:33,204
You're the one who's embarrassing!

891
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:35,706
(blower whines)

892
00:56:35,706 --> 00:56:36,539
Shut up!

893
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:39,400
- Not now.

894
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,703
- Not now, sorry.

895
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:50,140
- Well, young man, what can I do for you?

896
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,363
- [Winston] Answer my questions.

897
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:55,340
- Ask.

898
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,200
- Exactly how much money
do we have in our account?

899
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,402
- Enough.

900
00:57:00,402 --> 00:57:02,230
- Nothing, we have nothing in our account!

901
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:05,200
We are broke, we're in
debt up to our ears!

902
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,470
What, this is exactly what you do.

903
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,880
Every time something
gets up, you slip away!

904
00:57:13,254 --> 00:57:14,750
You know nothing about this place.

905
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,017
You don't even know how
to get your own cash.

906
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,178
You don't know anything
about the business,

907
00:57:18,178 --> 00:57:19,831
you don't know anything about your family.

908
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:21,950
You don't know about
anything but your clothes,

909
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,810
which, by the way, reek
ever since she died

910
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,228
because you can't your sweaty
shirts to the cleaners!

911
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:28,262
(woman chatters)

912
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:31,303
All you care about is breakfast,
lunch, women, women, women!

913
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,875
Right, Dad, you're sick.

914
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,750
You're sick in the head!

915
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:43,090
- My husband and I, we ran a movie theater

916
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,830
25 years ago, and, when it had to close,

917
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,510
we stored our mighty
Wurlitzer organ in parts

918
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,250
and boxed at this place.

919
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,829
Now, before my husband died,

920
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:59,310
the beautiful sound of that organ

921
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,620
came back to his mind, and he rang

922
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,147
this place several times.

923
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,680
Now, I just want you to know that nobody

924
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,540
should bother and that I have
no use for it any longer.

925
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,613
Thank you very much, sir, bye.

926
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,169
- Just going to go and air them out.

927
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:21,252
(motorcycle rumbles)

928
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:28,799
Ah, Penny!

929
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,457
(tires screech)

930
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,178
- [Driver] Crazy fucking asshole!

931
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:38,788
What the hell are you
trying to do, kill me?

932
00:58:38,788 --> 00:58:40,038
Get up, get up!

933
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:43,638
(calm music)

934
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:53,792
(Jonathan chuckles)

935
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:54,792
- Are you okay, Dad?

936
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:57,070
- Uh huh.

937
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,550
Penny.

938
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:59,383
- [Penny] Yes?

939
00:59:03,622 --> 00:59:05,472
- I think I'm getting a crush on you.

940
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:07,547
- Go on.

941
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:12,983
- I find you more and more beautiful,

942
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,803
more and more desirable.

943
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:19,150
- [Winston] Dad, are you still okay?

944
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:19,983
- Uh huh.

945
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,573
- Don't worry, I'll work hard, promise.

946
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,123
- May I ask you something?

947
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,206
- [Penny] Yes.

948
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,840
- Why do you look so young?

949
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:42,914
- Because you remember
me when we fell in love.

950
00:59:42,914 --> 00:59:44,079
- [Jonathan] Oh.

951
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,912
- I just made that up.

952
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:48,549
- Oh?

953
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:51,243
- You see, on Earth, you
grow older and older,

954
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:54,033
and, here, we grow younger and younger.

955
00:59:55,306 --> 00:59:58,175
- [Jonathan] Younger and
younger until you're babies?

956
00:59:58,175 --> 00:59:59,175
- No, silly!

957
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:05,267
Until we reach precisely the age

958
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,920
that we liked ourselves the best.

959
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,587
- Are you there yet?

960
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:14,435
- Not quite.

961
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:16,935
(quiet music)

962
01:00:51,374 --> 01:00:56,374
(people chattering)
(blower whines)

963
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,659
(horn honks)

964
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,326
(blower whines)

965
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:23,446
(ringing)
- Just give me a little time.

966
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:24,916
- Winston, are these
things are staying here?

967
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,297
- If you don't pay your
rent within 10 working days,

968
01:01:26,297 --> 01:01:29,214
I guarantee we're going to auction.

969
01:01:30,131 --> 01:01:31,063
- Sorry.
- What's this?

970
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:33,313
(shouting)

971
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:43,310
People, if you'll just give
me a little bit of time,

972
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,997
I guarantee everything will be done

973
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:46,861
to your full satisfaction.
(bell ringing)

974
01:01:46,861 --> 01:01:47,694
- Winston!

975
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,079
Your father wants to have lunch with you.

976
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,170
- [Delivery Woman] A nuthouse.

977
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,960
- Enjoy your lunch, and think of me,

978
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,673
your caring waitress Jaime Lee. (giggles)

979
01:02:07,705 --> 01:02:09,310
- Good.
- Huh?

980
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,793
- Very good idea.

981
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,150
- What?

982
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,973
- The loan on our property.

983
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,650
- Yeah, Dad, once the new system's set up,

984
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,780
things will run much more smoothly,

985
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,553
and the loan will be
(speaker drowned out).

986
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:27,246
(soft music)

987
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,373
- We should do this more often.

988
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:40,378
- What?

989
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:42,878
- Discuss business over lunch.

990
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,560
- Yes, yes, let's do that.

991
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,963
- We could have done that all these years.

992
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,113
- I'm so sorry.

993
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,870
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

994
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,147
We both had a tough day, it's all right.

995
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,708
- It'll be fine now.

996
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,625
- Do you still love me?

997
01:03:07,963 --> 01:03:10,630
- Of course, I always loved you.

998
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:12,747
- Always.

999
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:21,116
- You're so beautiful, so young.

1000
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:24,669
- You're beautiful, too.

1001
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:28,999
Do you remember when you used to play

1002
01:03:28,999 --> 01:03:31,797
the Wurlitzer for me, the first time?

1003
01:03:31,797 --> 01:03:32,748
I sat in your lap.

1004
01:03:32,748 --> 01:03:34,124
- And you were so proud of yourself

1005
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:36,590
because you put it together.

1006
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,090
All those thousands of pieces!

1007
01:03:42,128 --> 01:03:43,643
And then we danced.

1008
01:03:43,643 --> 01:03:46,393
(romantic music)

1009
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:15,144
- Oh, Penny.

1010
01:04:18,842 --> 01:04:22,009
- [Winston] It's okay, Dad, it's okay.

1011
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:26,174
- Winston.
- Mm hmm.

1012
01:04:32,788 --> 01:04:34,705
My taco's getting cold.

1013
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:42,668
- Got him!

1014
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,151
Everyone's back!

1015
01:04:45,151 --> 01:04:46,079
- Good deal!

1016
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,662
(whooshing)
(shouting)

1017
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:53,337
I'm sorry.

1018
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:57,173
Roger, no, I-

1019
01:04:58,205 --> 01:04:59,955
- [Roger] I kill you!

1020
01:05:04,886 --> 01:05:08,051
- Penny?

1021
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:09,801
Where are you, Penny?

1022
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,253
I miss you.

1023
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:23,220
- My mother, I think,
used to do this by hand.

1024
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,013
She was 10 times faster, but,

1025
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:29,400
as soon as I get this programed-

1026
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,233
- The better you feed your pig,

1027
01:05:30,233 --> 01:05:32,137
the better your pork will taste, right?

1028
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,263
- Right.

1029
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:39,023
- Good afternoon.

1030
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:40,450
- [Winston] How was your siesta?

1031
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:41,550
- It was great.

1032
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:42,870
- [Winston] I need you.

1033
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,690
- I'm going to go and play for a little,

1034
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,320
and then I'll be right back.

1035
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,323
- I need you, right now, please.

1036
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,410
- See you later.
- No.

1037
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:56,460
(pencil snaps)
(phone rings)

1038
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,380
Younger Self-Storage, can I help you?

1039
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,480
Can you hold, please?

1040
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,340
I'm sorry.

1041
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,530
This just isn't working right now.

1042
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,723
It's new equipment.

1043
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,095
Would you come back later?

1044
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:10,845
(computer beeps)

1045
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,246
This is Winston, may I help you?

1046
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:17,634
Mr. Younger's away from
his desk right now.

1047
01:06:17,634 --> 01:06:19,780
Uh huh, oh, it's here somewhere.

1048
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,480

1131
01:14:53,228 --> 01:14:54,140
- [ZigZag Lilian] Oh, well,
he fell from the roof, stupid.

1132
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,600
How come you know this bum?

1133
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,504
- He's my father, he works in this office.

1134
01:14:57,504 --> 01:14:58,780
- Oh, come on, kids, call an ambulance,

1135
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,530
get me some water, blankets, think!

1136
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:04,241
- Go in the office and dial nine.

1137
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:05,689
- Everything will be fine.

1138
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:06,938
- [Jonathan] ZigZag Lilian.

1139
01:15:06,938 --> 01:15:08,882
- [ZigZag Lilian] Now, come
on, that's not important now.

1140
01:15:08,882 --> 01:15:11,575
- [Jonathan] How's Max?

1141
01:15:11,575 --> 01:15:12,813
- What?

1142
01:15:12,813 --> 01:15:15,396
- Your husband, Mr. Beerbrower.

1143
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,010
- Well, everyone knows that he's-

1144
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:21,180
- Dead.

1145
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,443
Death by skateboard.

1146
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,947
South to mortality.

1147
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,623
- They should be on their way.

1148
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,690
Thanks for waiting, and-

1149
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:31,660
- Stop that.

1150
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,170
What's your name?

1151
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,053
- Winston.

1152
01:15:38,078 --> 01:15:39,173
- Hi, I'm Lilian.

1153
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,590
- [Melodie] Here, Mother.

1154
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:44,090
- This is my daughter Melodie.

1155
01:15:45,919 --> 01:15:46,752
Here.

1156
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:49,400
Relax and take it easy.

1157
01:15:50,706 --> 01:15:52,760
Okay, try this.

1158
01:15:57,809 --> 01:15:59,690
Ah, he's adorable.

1159
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:01,040
- He'll be okay.

1160
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,610
Lucky those boxes were over there.

1161
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:03,860
- [Winston] I don't care.

1162
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,786
- [Melodie] Do you wanna talk about it?

1163
01:16:07,786 --> 01:16:08,619
- No.

1164
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:15,830
- At least you have a real father.

1165
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:17,140
- A real father.

1166
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,223
- No, seriously.

1167
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:22,430
My mother, she dragged me
from husband to husband.

1168
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,600
I never had to remember their names.

1169
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,520
I'd meet them, call them Father,

1170
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,483
they'd leave, and I'd call
the next one Father, too.

1171
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:34,863
- That's sad.

1172
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,433
- It's overwhelming.

1173
01:16:39,206 --> 01:16:44,206
- I know how you feel.

1174
01:16:45,377 --> 01:16:50,323
- I think I'd really like
to be me, just me, for once.

1175
01:16:54,248 --> 01:16:56,870
- Oh, Penny.

1176
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:57,703
Oh, Penny.

1177
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:58,733
Oh, excuse me.

1178
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,263
Penny, hi.

1179
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,168
Would you like to have dinner with me?

1180
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,170
- I have a date already.

1181
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:14,712
- What?

1182
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:17,193
You have a date?

1183
01:17:18,673 --> 01:17:19,980
No.

1184
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:20,813
No!

1185
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,053
With whom?

1186
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,710
Max!

1187
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:29,180
- Melodie, Winston, get over here.

1188
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,013
Come on.

1189
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,510
- [Max] May I?

1190
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,643
- Thank you, you're very kind.

1191
01:17:39,513 --> 01:17:41,140
- May I?
- Thank you.

1192
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,490
I fancy you're new around here.

1193
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,562
- Why would you say that?

1194
01:17:45,562 --> 01:17:46,593
- Your age.

1195
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:49,550
- Oh, no, this is my ideal age.

1196
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,583
I never felt better.

1197
01:17:51,995 --> 01:17:54,216
- I can see that.

1198
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,792
You're beautiful.

1199
01:17:55,792 --> 01:17:57,657
(Max laughs)

1200
01:17:57,657 --> 01:17:58,707
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1201
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,430
- Who's Penny?

1202
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:03,610
- [Winston] My dead mother.

1203
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:04,443
- Holy shit.

1204
01:18:05,836 --> 01:18:07,086
He's seeing Max with her.

1205
01:18:08,665 --> 01:18:10,933
He's seeing my dead
husband with his dead wife.

1206
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,993
How does he look?

1207
01:18:13,993 --> 01:18:15,453
- Awfully well, actually.

1208
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,260
Penny!

1209
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,390
Don't leave me like this.

1210
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:22,383
- Have you ever made love on a cloud?

1211
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,860
- It's been a while, Max.

1212
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:28,378
(siren wails)

1213
01:18:28,378 --> 01:18:31,011
- Do you prefer harder or softer clouds?

1214
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:33,511
(siren wails)

1215
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:43,414
(thudding)

1216
01:18:55,918 --> 01:18:58,085
(banging)

1217
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:08,020
- [Jonathan] I beg you, please.

1218
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:12,621
- No, no way.

1219
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:14,571
- It's the only way I can get her back.

1220
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:19,953
Please?

1221
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:24,010
- If you break in there and
play that goddamn thing,

1222
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:26,490
I'll break each and every finger of yours,

1223
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:27,323
one by one.

1224
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:39,303
- She's with him.

1225
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:46,230
She's with Max, making
love on a bloody cloud.

1226
01:19:49,432 --> 01:19:51,243
- Hey, what are you doing over there?

1227
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,533
Father!

1228
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,960
- [Jonathan] Yes.

1229
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,930
- You're not gonna cause
us any more trouble.

1230
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:03,023
- She's just trying to make me jealous.

1231
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,820
She wants me, and she
wants me to want her.

1232
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,713
And I do, I want her.

1233
01:20:10,927 --> 01:20:12,233
- Except you're too late.

1234
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,600
She was only sitting in
front of you for 26 years.

1235
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:21,423
- I want to be young with her.

1236
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:25,000
I want her to forgive me.

1237
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,787
- [Winston] I'm not gonna let
you do this a second time.

1238
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:29,870
- There's just one thing
I have to wait for.

1239
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:31,123
- No.
- Just one thing.

1240
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,989
- It's all right, it's okay.

1241
01:20:35,989 --> 01:20:37,100
- Winston.

1242
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,176
- Father, you're staying
right here, come on.

1243
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:41,074
- Winston.

1244
01:20:41,074 --> 01:20:42,650
- There's no easy way out, all right?

1245
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:43,930
I want you to come away from the edge.

1246
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,827
- Winston?
- And just give me

1247
01:20:45,827 --> 01:20:47,658
your hand, what are you doing?
- Winston!

1248
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:49,356
- Oh my God!
- No!

1249
01:20:49,356 --> 01:20:50,720
(thudding)
(grunting)

1250
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,387
(cat screeches)

1251
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:01,150
- He's a sexist, he killed her.

1252
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,160
He killed my mother with his Wurlitzer.

1253
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,210
- [Melodie] His what?

1254
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:08,160
- He dragged those women
upstairs, and he raped them,

1255
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,380
and my mother, my mother had
to listen to it, right here.

1256
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,203
- [Melodie] That's not true, Winston.

1257
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:15,750
- You don't know.

1258
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:17,973
- I do know.

1259
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:19,913
Hey, look at me.

1260
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,120
He played for me, too.

1261
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,080
- [Winston] He did what?

1262
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:25,913
When?

1263
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:29,120
- Before the trial, you weren't here.

1264
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,953
- And?

1265
01:21:29,953 --> 01:21:31,223
- [Melodie] I was storing some things.

1266
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:34,280
- And he dragged you upstairs, too, I bet.

1267
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,974
He probably raped you like the others.

1268
01:21:36,974 --> 01:21:40,704
- No, Winston, he invited me,

1269
01:21:40,704 --> 01:21:44,081
'cause I was really upset and crying.

1270
01:21:44,081 --> 01:21:46,524
He comforted me, touched me.

1271
01:21:46,524 --> 01:21:48,929
- Touched you?

1272
01:21:48,929 --> 01:21:50,831
He touched you?

1273
01:21:50,831 --> 01:21:51,664
- Yes.

1274
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:54,460
He touched my heart.

1275
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:57,464
He didn't lay a finger on me.

1276
01:21:57,464 --> 01:21:59,464
He was a real gentleman.

1277
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,043
- That's not true.

1278
01:22:03,088 --> 01:22:04,210
- Yes, it is.

1279
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,793
(gentle music)

1280
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,353
Does it hurt?

1281
01:22:36,749 --> 01:22:41,410
Would you mind if I helped
you straighten up this mess?

1282
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:43,147
- [Winston] If you know how to.

1283
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:45,730
(gentle music)

1284
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,920
- What did she look like?

1285
01:22:58,902 --> 01:23:00,319
I can't remember.

1286
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,667
- You don't have any pictures of her?

1287
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:13,916
- I didn't take any.

1288
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:14,749
Penny!

1289
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,381
(rattling)

1290
01:23:35,255 --> 01:23:36,240
Penny.

1291
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,490
(rattling)

1292
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:03,980
- Thank you for dinner.

1293
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:05,803
The (speaking foreign
language) was really good.

1294
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,133
My tongue's still on fire.

1295
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:12,110
- His morning hangout.

1296
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:14,440
- What?

1297
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,640
What did you say?
- Oh.

1298
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:17,803
Nothing.

1299
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:26,213
So where did you get
that cute French accent?

1300
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:28,940
- Boarding school, Paris.

1301
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:31,340
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

1302
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:33,573
Are you okay?
- Fine.

1303
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,550
- My mother gave it to me, I like it.

1304
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:44,950
Beat you.

1305
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:45,900
- That seems wrong.

1306
01:24:47,536 --> 01:24:49,910
That irresponsible bastard
went and left this up

1307
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:51,705
because he's upstairs
playing with his organ!

1308
01:24:51,705 --> 01:24:52,725
- [Melodie] No!

1309
01:24:52,725 --> 01:24:55,892
(playful organ music)

1310
01:24:59,243 --> 01:25:00,993
- It plays by itself.

1311
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:03,546
That faker!

1312
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:05,870
Stop!

01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:09,287
(discordant organ music)

1314
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,491
- He's not here, either.

1315
01:25:26,491 --> 01:25:27,324
- Come on.

1316
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:32,628
Gone!

1317
01:25:34,828 --> 01:25:36,683
