00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,900
<i>The Battlestar Galactica,</i>

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:07,135
<i>veteran of the first Cylon war
fought almost a half century ago.</i>

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,901
<i>She was nearing the end
of her career in the colonial fleet</i>

4
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:15,065
<i>with no enemy to fight
and her useful days long since past.</i>

5
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:19,392
<i>She was scheduled to be decommissioned
and turned into a museum ship.</i>

6
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:23,439
<i>No one had seen or
heard from the Cylons in 40 years</i>

7
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,930
<i>and Galactica seemed
like a relic from an other era.</i>

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,690
On behalf to Galactica,
I'd like to welcome you onboard, Apollo.

9
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,446
It's an honour to have you with us.

10
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,404
Morning, sir.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,982
We must not forget the reasons why...

12
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:46,118
Commander Adama, if I may...

13
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,451
Captain...

14
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:51,207
I just wanted to say what a pleasure it's
been serving with you in your command, sir.

15
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:53,695
Captain Kelly, this is my honour.

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,637
<i>As the secretary of education,
I was invited aboard for the ceremony.</i>

17
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:02,374
<i>It seemed like a routine
even a boring asignment at first</i>

18
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:05,886
<i>but it was
the most faithful day of my life.</i>

19
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,127
Here we go.

20
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:11,122
- If you gonna play with the big dogs...
- No fear.

21
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,338
- I'm in.
- That's you, XO.

22
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,009
- I'm in.
- Right.

23
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,917
30 to me.

24
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:23,054
and it looks like I'm gonna bring
this lovely little game to a close cause...

25
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:25,316
Full colours !

26
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:43,613
You have finally gone too far
and now you're done

27
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:46,552
Lieutenant, report to the brig !

28
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:50,941
Are you really gonna
press charges against Kara ?

29
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:54,377
- I couldn't talk you out of it, OK ?
- Not a chance.

30
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:57,137
She's insubordinate, undisciplined.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,658
Probably one of the finest
fighter pilots I've ever seen in my life.

32
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,880
Better than I am, twice as good as you.

33
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,627
Like hell...

34
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:13,712
It seems familiar.

35
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:19,346
Captain Adama, sir.

36
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:25,031
Sorry I wasn't there to greet you
with the rest of the squadron.

37
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:29,117
Did they kiss you ass to your satisfaction ?

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,675
- So, how long has it been ?
- 2 years.

39
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:37,910
We must be getting old. Seems like
the funeral was just a couple months ago.

40
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,261
Your old man is doing fine.

41
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:43,874
We don't talk about it much,
maybe 2 or 3 times a year.

42
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:47,465
- He still struggles with it, though.
- I haven't seen him.

43
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,824
- Kara, don't even start.
- How long are you gonna do this ?

44
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:55,357
- I'm not doing anything.
- He lost his son, Lee.

45
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:59,523
- Zack was my brother.
- What was he to me, nothing ?

46
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:07,165
<i>Today, we're talking
with Doctor Gaius Baltar.</i>

47
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,489
<i>He is currently working as a top consultant</i>

48
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,954
<i>for the ministry of defense
on computer issues.</i>

49
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:15,102
<i>but he's perhaps
best known for his controversial views</i>

50
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,543
<i>on advancing computer technology.</i>

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,623
- Dr. Baltar, welcome.
- Thank you, Kella.

52
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:23,264
My position is very simple.

53
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:27,266
The ban on the search and
development into artificial intelligence is,

54
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:30,690
as we all know,
a old habit from the cylon wars.

55
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:33,519
Quite frankly, I find this
to be an outmoded concept.

56
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,977
- Do you love me, Gaius ?
- What ?

57
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,700
Do you love me ?

58
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:43,854
Are you serious ?

59
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,661
You had me worried there.

60
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,892
And now it is my great pleasure to introduce

61
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,467
the last commander
of the Battlestar Galactica.

62
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,049
Commander Adama.

63
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:14,116
Thank you very much.

64
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,658
You can not play God and
wash your hands of the things you created.

65
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,839
Sooner or later,

66
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:26,541
day comes when you can't hide
from the things that you've done anymore.

67
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:30,720
<i>Who were the Cylons ?
They were machines</i>

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,675
<i>created by men
to make life easier on the 12 Colonies.</i>

69
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,641
<i>But there came a day
when they rose up against us</i>

70
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:41,725
<i>and the bloody conflict known
as the Cylon war was the result.</i>

71
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:47,638
<i>At his conlusion a truce was signed and
the Cylons left for a world of their own.</i>

72
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,932
<i>A remote space station was built</i>

73
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:54,903
<i>where Humen and Cylons
could meet and maintain diplomatic relation.</i>

74
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:03,419
<i>Every year for 40 years
we sent an officer to the station.</i>

75
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,901
<i>The Cylons sent no one.</i>

76
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,450
<i>Until one day
a Cylon representative appeared.</i>

77
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:17,326
<i>But not the robotic centurions
we were familiar with.</i>

78
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:25,279
<i>The Cylons had evolved.</i>

79
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,075
It has begun.

80
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,108
So now you're telling me you're a machine.

81
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,169
I've said it three times now.

82
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:47,835
Forgive me, I'm having
a little bit of trouble believing that

83
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:51,920
because the last time anybody saw the cylons
they looked more like walking chrome toasters

84
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,563
Those models are still around.
They have their uses.

85
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,336
You were chosen for my mission.

86
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,716
Your mission ?

87
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,749
You knew I wanted
access to the defense mainframe.

88
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,383
Wait a minute...

89
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:09,002
The defense mainframe ?

90
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:12,768
- What exactly are you saying ?
- Come on, Gaius.

91
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,749
The communications frequencies,

92
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:18,298
deployment schedules,
unlimited access to every database.

93
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh, my God.

94
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,119
In a few hours, no one will be left.

95
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:27,063
Humanity's children are returning home.

96
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,819
Today.

97
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:33,904
Wait, there has to be
another way out of here. I mean,

98
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,758
- you must have an escape plan.
- Gaius...

99
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,326
I can't die.

100
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:42,998
When this body is destroyed, my memory,

101
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,768
my consciousness,
will be transmitted to a new one.

102
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,125
I'll just wake up somewhere else
in an identical body.

103
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,177
You mean there's more out there like you ?

104
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,881
There are 12 models, I'm number 6.

105
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,613
- I don't want to die.
- Get down !

106
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:09,480
Moments ago, this ship received word

107
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,227
of a cylon attack
against our home worlds is underway.

108
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,574
You're trained for this,

109
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,621
you're ready for this.

110
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,818
As of this moment,

111
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:21,489
we are at war.

112
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:30,512

114
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,266
<i>The Cylon attack caught us by surprise.</i>

115
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:42,026
<i>All 12 colonies were annihilated.</i>

116
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,552
<i>The human race was nealy wiped out.</i>

117
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:47,545
<i>Only a few thousands survivors managed to escape.</i>

118
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:50,653
Enemy suppression fire,
all batteries execute.

119
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,005
<i>And still the cylons
were endlessly pursuing us.</i>

120
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,043
Starbuck, clear for launch.

121
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,319
Oh, frack me !

122
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,241
- Hold it together, guys.
- Come on...

123
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,295
Apollo, do you read me ?

124
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,948
Come on, bitch !

125
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,197
Looks like you broke your ship, Apollo !

126
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,219
I'm loosing power !

127
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,731
- I'm not gonna make it, Starbuck !
- Shut up and hold still !

128
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,534
Oh, no...

129
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,480
You are beyond insane !

130
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,663
They're coming in !

131
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:35,556
Battlestar Atlantia has been destroyed,

132
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,415
so is the Triton,

133
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:39,462
Soleria,

134
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:41,631
Columbia,

135
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:44,899
- and the list goes on.
- Who's the senior officer ?

136
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:47,198
Who's in command ?

137
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:52,438
Send a message
to all the colonial military units.

138
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:54,691
Use priority channel 1.

139
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,268
Message begins.

140
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,132
I'm taking command of fleet.

141
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:04,498
<i>This is an official colonial broadcast.</i>

142
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,275
<i>All ministers and official
should now go to case orange.</i>

143
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,388
It's an automatic message.

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,815
It's designed to be
sent out in case the President,

145
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,514
the Vice President and most of
the cabinet are dead or incapacitated.

146
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:23,901
<i>As Secretary of Education,
I was 43rd in line to the presidency.</i>

147
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:27,751
<i>I had never thought the office
and suddenly it was thrusted upon me.</i>

148
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,818
I, Laura Roslin

149
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,043
do now avow and affirm

150
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:36,269
do now avow and affirm

151
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:41,306
that I take the office of
the President of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

152
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:48,348
that I accept the office of the President
of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

153
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:56,067
<i>On Caprica, a group of people
had survived the nuclear holocaust.</i>

154
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:59,494
<i>but they would soon
succomb to radiation poisoning.</i>

155
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,702
<i>One Raptor from Galactica
had enough space to rescue a lucky few.</i>

156
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,219
Aren't you Gaius Baltar ?

157
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,726
What are you doing ?

158
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:16,596
Giving up my seat.

159
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,361
Like hell.

160
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,805
A civilian should take my place.

161
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:23,325
Whatever future is left
is gonna to depend on whoever survives.

162
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,100
Give me one reason why I'm a better choice
than one of the greatest minds of our time.

163
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,630
- Helo...
- You can do this without me.

164
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:33,358
I know you can, you've proven it.

165
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:40,240
Get on board.

166
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,759
Stay back ! It's over !

167
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,452
I've got something for you.

168
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:07,142
It belonged to your grandfather.

169
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:11,362
He's a better father than I was.

170
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:17,033
Dad used to carry that
into court cases, he claimed he never lost

171
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,188
unless he lef it behind.

172
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,194
So you're worried too.

173
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,866
Sometimes you feel like the whole ship

174
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:33,544
thinks Starbuck would do better.

175
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,014
I don't.

176
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:40,192
How can you be so sure ?

177
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,805
Cause you're my son.

178
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,287
I see they've put you to work.

179
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:03,343
Ignoring me won't help.

180
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,866
No, I've decided you're
an expression of my subconscious mind

181
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:09,750
playing itself out during my waking states.

182
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:13,278
So I'm only in your head ?

183
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,159
Exactly.

184
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,064
We had something, Gaius.

185
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,102
Something...

186
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,628
... special.

187
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:29,686
- This is insane.
- And what I want most of all

188
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,014
is for you to love me.

189
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:35,385
Don't you understand ? God is love.

190
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,016
No !

191
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:47,645
<i>Galactica and a small fleet
of civilian ships had escaped the Cylons</i>

192
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,278
<i>but our losses
were heavy and our future uncertain.</i>

193
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,476
Are they the lucky ones ?

194
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,804
That's what you're thinking, isn't it ?

195
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:02,456
Maybe it would have been
better for us to have died quickly,

196
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:05,010
back on the colonies with our families

197
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:09,608
instead of dying out here
slowly in the emptiness of dark space.

198
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,359
We have a refuge to go to !

199
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,143
A refuge that the Cylons know nothing about !

200
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,920
On the memory of
those lying here before you,

201
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:24,901
we shall find it.

202
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,013
And Earth

203
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,436
will becomme our new home.

204
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:39,168
- So say we all !
- So say we all.

205
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:42,628
- So say we all !
- So say we all !

206
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,747
There is no Earth.

207
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,841
You made it all up.

208
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,264
You're right.

209
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,381
There is no Earth.

210
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,576
It's all a legend.

211
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,168
Then why ?

212
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,412
Because it's not enough to just live.

213
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,888
You have to have something to live for.

214
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:10,367
Let it be Earth.

215
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,283
We're gonna take the civilians with us.

216
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,611
We're gonna leave this solar system.
We're not gonna come back.

217
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:20,407
- We're running.
- This war is over.

218
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,402
We lost.

219
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:27,087
My father's right,
it's time for us to get out of here.

220
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,320
<i>The human race was
reduced to less than 50 000 people</i>

221
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:36,013
<i>cramed into a ragtag fleet of ships and
protected only by the Battlestar Galactica.</i>

222
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:40,464
<i>We began the search for Earth
hoping to make it our new home.</i>

223
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,689
We can't let them go.

224
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,215
Unfortunately, I agree.

225
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,774
If we do, they'll
return one day and take revenge.

226
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,037
- It's in their nature.
- We have no choice.

227
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:54,013
It may take
several decades to track them down.

228
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:01,436
Don't worry, we'll find them.

229
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:07,071
<i>We jumped deep into uncharted space,</i>

230
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,338
<i>hoping to put some distance
between ourselves and the Cylons</i>

231
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,742
<i>but they followed us at every turn.</i>

232
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:18,108
<i>Eventually, we made the chocking discovery
that our enemies were not only chasing us,</i>

233
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,897
<i>they were also living among us.</i>

234
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,854
Good afternoon and thank you for coming.

235
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,555
I feel it is time to reveal certain
information that hasn't until now.

236
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,137
We made it tightly garded secret.

237
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,649
The cylons have the hability to
mimic human form, they look like us, now.

238
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:41,706
This man has been
identified as a Cylon agent.

239
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:45,311
This man has also
been identified as a Cylon

240
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:50,365
and we now know that there
are duplicates of each cylon model.

241
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:56,924
anyone seeing either of this two men
at any time, anywhere, in the fleet

242
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:02,066
should immediatly contact the Battlestar
Galactica and the office of the President.

243
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,968
We haven't addressed
the real problem, of course.

244
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:08,986
Yes, there may be
cylon agents living among us

245
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,071
waiting to strike at any moment.

246
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:14,239
Some may not even know they're Cylons at all.

247
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:16,959
They could be sleeper agents programmed

248
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,924
to perfectly impersonate
human beings until activation.

249
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:23,445
If there's Cylons
aboard this ship, we'll find them.

250
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,797
We ?

251
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,631
You're not on their side, Gaius.

252
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:36,349
I am not on anybody's side.

253
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:44,440
<i>One of our pilots, Helo, have been
trapped on Caprica and left for dead.</i>

254
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:48,074
<i>He was captured by Cylons Centurions.</i>

255
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:58,859
<i>Became rescued by a woman he thought
was his copilot and friend, Sharon Valerii.</i>

256
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,703
- Sharon ?
- But this was not the woman he knew.

257
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:04,641
- In fact, she wasn't even human.
- Can you walk ?

258
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,951
Yeah, I think so.

259
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,491
She was a Cylon.

260
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:11,048
- What are you doing here, I thought...
- Let's move, mister.

261
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:14,324
<i>A duplicate copy of Sharon, one of many.</i>

262
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,347
<i>And she was actually
on an important mission.</i>

263
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:23,460
<i>Fear swept through the fleet as we began
to search for sleeper agents in our beds.</i>

264
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:27,010
<i>And I began to experience
strange and disturbing visions.</i>

265
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,587
So, what have you seen ?

266
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:33,416
There were snakes crawling all over
my podium during the press conference.

267
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,214
- How many ?
- About a dozen.

268
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,849
Pythie wrote about the exile
and the rebirth of the Human race.

269
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,815
And the Lords anointed a leader

270
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:47,891
to guide the caravan
of the Heavens to their new homeland.

271
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:50,598
And onto the leader, they gave a vision

272
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:54,034
of serpents numbering 2 and 10

273
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:56,400
as a sign of things to come.

274
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:02,392
So, according to the Scriptures,
if we have the arrow of Apollo

275
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,294
We could take it down
to Kobol and we could use it

276
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:09,322
to open the tomb of Athena
and find a way to Earth.

277
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:13,256
There is no Earth, you understand that.

278
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:16,122
It would seem that we were wrong.

279
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,859
- This is crazy.
- It is crazy.

280
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,474
Perhaps.

281
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,517
But that doesn't mean it isn't true.

282
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:30,122
If you go back
to Caprica and bring me the arrow,

283
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:33,212
I will show us the way.

284
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:41,160
- You sleep, I watch.
- No, you're the one who needs to sleep.

285
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,851
I couldn't sleep if I had
to listen Tyrol read the flight manual.

286
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,278
OK.

287
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,381
Truth is...

288
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,869
if something happened to you,

289
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:58,197
I wouldn't know how to deal with it.

290
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:04,357
<i>The Cylons though indistiguishable
from the humans had one flaw.</i>

291
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,770
<i>They could not have children.</i>

292
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,915
<i>They believed that
perhaps love was the missing element</i>

293
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:13,934
<i>so they used
Helo as pawn for an experiment,</i>

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,178
<i>hoping to use his love
for Sharon to create a hybrid child.</i>

295
00:20:18,612 --> 00:20:21,523
- We had sex.
- Congratulations.

296
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,898
- Does he love you ?
- I think so.

297
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,692
Stay in your current location.

298
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:29,363
It shouldn't be too hard to convince
him to stay and start a life together.

299
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,464
If not, kill him.

300
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,755
Can you handle that ?

301
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,802
<i>But their plan worked too well.</i>

302
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:43,354
<i>The Cylon Sharon fell in love with Helo and
she found herself unable to let go of him.</i>

303
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:46,716
<i>And even after Helo
discovered the truth about Sharon,</i>

304
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:49,082
<i>He couldn't let go of her either.</i>

305
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,775
I just want you to know that
I genuinely feel something for you.

306
00:20:57,348 --> 00:21:00,296
Helo, there's something else you should know.

307
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,628
I am pregnant.

308
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:13,473
<i>The Sharon on Galactica was tortured by
the idea that she might be a sleeper agent.</i>

309
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,846
<i>Others began to suspect her as well.</i>

310
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,236
This is not true.

311
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,564
No, it's not.

312
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:28,530
If you're working on a Cylon detector,
do you think I could be in the first batch ?

313
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:30,643
You know, to be tested.

314
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:34,784
You just put this
in the slot and wait for the results.

315
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:38,903
Green, you're normal human being.

316
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:41,664
Red, you're an evil Cylon.

317
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:47,395
It should take a couple of minutes.

318
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:57,474
Congratulations, Doctor,
you just uncovered your very first Cylon.

319
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:04,516
She probably doesn't know.

320
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:08,145
It should be interesting how
she responds when you tell her the truth.

321
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm guessing her Cylon side
will take over and break your neck

322
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,779
before you can give away her secret.

323
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:20,985
Congratulations, it's green !

324
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:23,107
- You're not a Cylon !
- Really ?

325
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:26,638
A 100% human and very bright green, as well.

326
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:33,917
<i>At my request, Starbuck
returned to the ruined city on Caprica</i>

327
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,523
<i>to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo.</i>

328
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,205
Pretty, isn't it ?

329
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:56,544
Hello, Lieutenant.

330
00:22:56,713 --> 00:22:58,554
Something I can help you with ?

331
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,124
Starbuck ?

332
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,000
I missed you.

333
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:13,187
You can't, she's pregnant.

334
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:21,829
<i>The Sharon on Galactica was
a respected and beloved member of the crew.</i>

335
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:24,860
Congratulations to both of you.

336
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,945
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

337
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:28,739
Thank you, sir.

338
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:33,734
<i>Until her cylon programing
was finally activated.</i>

339
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:52,208
- Make a hole !
- Where are the medics and Doc Cottle ?

340
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:55,138
Off the ship, now, stand clear !

341
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:03,137
What's going on ?
What happened ?

342
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:06,395
Sergent of the guard,
secure that thing in the brig.

343
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:08,846
Let's go, let's go !

344
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,157
Let's get him down to sickbay RFN.

345
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:25,681
Her consciousness is being
downloaded into an other body right now

346
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,808
and when she wakes up,
she'll tell them exactly where we are.

347
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:31,446
She's right, we can't stay here.

348
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,201
Sharon the Cylon is right.

349
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:39,201
- She helped me get this far.
- OK, I get it !

350
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:42,649
I remember how you felt about her
but that is not the real Sharon.

351
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:45,081
That is some cheap knock off copy.

352
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:48,639
I'm not a copy, I'm Sharon.

353
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,568
I remember
the first day I met you, Starbuck,

354
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,325
you were pucking your guts
out in the head because...

355
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:57,118
Don't do that !

356
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,893
Carl do not think that I will not shoot...

357
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:06,527
I'm gonna let you kill her, OK ?
She's carrying my child.

358
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,659
They're not human, Helo. They're machines.

359
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:13,300
You can't have a baby with a machine.

360
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,830
I don't know what to tell you, OK ?
But I believe her.

361
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:19,328
She is not like the others.

362
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,403
She is not !

363
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,423
<i>With Commander Adama clinging to life,</i>

364
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:33,971
<i>his crew on Galactica
lashed out on the traitor Cylon.</i>

365
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:01,768
<i>For Sharon, the process
of downloading and rebirth began instantly.</i>

366
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,928
... right through it.
You're going to be OK, trust me.

367
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,773
We're proud of you, Sharon.

368
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:11,406
<i>But this Sharon
still thought of herself as human</i>

369
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:14,097
<i>and when she walked to face her true nature...</i>

370
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,768
And we love you.

371
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,685
<i>... it felt more like a nightmare.</i>

372
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:32,107
<i>The Number 6 that died in the initial attack
on Caprica was also downloaded and reborn.</i>

373
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:36,830
I still try to getting used to this body.
I mean I know it's identical but...

374
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,399
Even after all this time,
I still feel awkward.

375
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:46,057
I was a klutz too. I say knock things over.
This is a great chance to cleanse.

376
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:48,883
You got a new body, a new life.

377
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:53,436
And anything that you've built up
like anxieties or remorse or guilt,

378
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:58,760
- just let it wash away.
- I can't tell you how thankful I am.

379
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:03,603
- You've been a really big help to me.
- No, it's me who's thankful.

380
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:09,396
We all are. You are a war hero.
We could not have won without you.

381
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,579
All right, let's get
these weapons unload, let's go !

382
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:18,532
<i>While on Caprica, Starbuck encountered
a group of resistance led by Samuel Anders.</i>

383
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:22,195
<i>Their time together was brief
but it touched each of them deeply.</i>

384
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,345
I'm not gonna leave you here.

385
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,403
I'm coming back.

386
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:42,051
I said it.

387
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,086
I meant it.

388
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,957
Adama ! Adama ! Adama !

389
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:00,892
<i>After a long rehabilitation,</i>

390
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:05,469
<i>Commander Adama regained his strength
and returned to his crew in the CIC.</i>

391
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,356
Very good to see you, sir !

392
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:14,164
There are things
we don't say often enough.

393
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:17,698
Things like what we mean to one an other.

394
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:21,491
All of you mean a lot to me.

395
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:25,087
I just want you to know that.

396
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:34,365
<i>Starbuck returned
to Galactica with the Arrow of Apollo,</i>

397
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:37,291
<i>Helo and the Cylon Sharon from Caprica.</i>

398
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,579
Good to see you too, Captain.

399
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:54,337
- Lee, wait !
- Don't you fracking move !

400
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:59,246
Drop your weapon, sir !
Drop your weapon.

401
00:29:59,312 --> 00:30:00,701
Helo !

402
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:14,575
Now put that thing out of the airlock.

403
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:17,420
- What ?
- We don't keep Cylons around here, Lt.

404
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,974
- You said you wouldn't hurt her !
- No !

405
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,095
Helo, listen to me !

406
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:27,442
One of those things
put 2 rounds into my father's chest.

407
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:30,542
- It wasn't me !
- For the love of Gods, Sharon !

408
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:33,228
This Sharon saved
our lives back on Caprica, tell them !

409
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:37,068
I know how to find
the tomb of Athena, do you ?

410
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:41,988
Kobol's a big planet ! You don't
find the tomb, you don't find Earth !

411
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:44,952
Madame President.

412
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,811
- Tell them to wait a minute.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:57,021
Must have been hard,

414
00:30:57,762 --> 00:31:00,861
being back on Caprica, being home.

415
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:05,056
Probably saw some tough things back there.

416
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:09,206
Anyway, tomorrow this whole thing
is gonna end, one way or another.

417
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:12,624
We find the tomb or we don't.
We find a way to Earth or we don't.

418
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:16,964
I just want you to know, Kara,
that I'm your friend. I love you.

419
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:21,133
If there's anything you wanna talk about,
anything you wanna get off your chest, then

420
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,442
I'm here for you.

421
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,009
Did you say you love me ?

422
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,188
- Well...
- Lee Adama loves me.

423
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:35,587
- No, all I meant was...
- No, seriously, very sweet.

424
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:37,733
You love me.

425
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:43,386
No, you love me. You can't
take it back, there's no take backs.

426
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:45,855
- You're dreaming it, Kara...
- You love me.

427
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:47,869
- You love me.
- Dreamer.

428
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:58,308
<i>With the Arrow of Apollo in
our possession, the prophecy came to pass.</i>

429
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:03,238
<i>Led by the Cylon Sharon, we found our way
to Kobol and the ancient tomb of Athena.</i>

430
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:37,864
These patterns were
on the original flags of the 12 Colonies

431
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,625
back in the days when the Colonies
were called by their ancient names.

432
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:43,760
Aries.

433
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,080
Taurus.

434
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,906
The jewels match the constellations.

435
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,920
This is the map...

436
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:54,876
This is the map to Earth.

437
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,764
<i>After months of captivity
in a cell aboard Galactica,</i>

438
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,834
<i>the Cylon Sharon gave birth to the baby.</i>

439
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:11,721
<i>A girl...</i>

440
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,862
We made her.

441
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:17,110
It almost makes you
want to believe in the cylon God.

442
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:21,720
Almost.

443
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,175
This child will not be raised by the cylon

444
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:29,471
and I can not risk
cylon agents getting their hands on it.

445
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:34,381
<i>I divised a plan to switch
the Cylon child with a stillborn human baby.</i>

446
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:38,671
She finally went into respiratory distress,
we couldn't get her intubated in time and...

447
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:43,319
we lost her, I'm sorry.

448
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:48,286
- You murdered her !
- Sharon...

449
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,867
Die !

450
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:57,571
You killed my baby !

451
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:04,447
She's so beautiful.

452
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:08,822
You understand, Maya, that
this adoption requires absolute secrecy.

453
00:34:08,926 --> 00:34:11,851
The mother is a Pegasus officer
and must remain anonymous

454
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:15,325
- for political and religious reasons.
- You have my word.

455
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:19,738
Maya, you won't mind
if I drop in occasionally.

456
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,673
Of course not.

457
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:29,936
Good.

458
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:36,240
<i>With the Cylon child safely
hidden within the fleet, live moved on.</i>

459
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:43,711
<i>Adama awarded his son
Commander of the Battlestar Pegasus,</i>

460
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:46,114
<i>sister ship to Galactica.</i>

461
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:48,593
Congratulations, Commander.

462
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:51,992
Congratulations.

463
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:54,457
Really...

464
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:59,011
You deserve it.

465
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:11,774
<i>My term as president was drawing
to a close and a new election was coming up.</i>

466
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:14,576
<i>Doctor Baltar emerged as my chief opponent</i>

467
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,305
<i>and I was determined
not to turn the human race over</i>

468
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:19,960
<i>to a man I had never completely trusted.</i>

469
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:23,284
I'm going to wipe
the floor with you, Gaius.

470
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,598
You must be losing your mind again.

471
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:31,658
If that's the best you can come up with,
you're in a lot of trouble, good luck.

472
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
I am picking up a large planetary body.

473
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:38,214
<i>But the election took an
unexpected turn when a routine Raptor mission</i>

474
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,831
<i>discovered what would
become the central issue of the campaign.</i>

475
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:46,807
Atmosphere is nitrogen/oxygen.
Organic molecular spectra.

476
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:49,015
Fresh water.

477
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:53,156
We may have just found a world
that can support human life.

478
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:03,061
Less than 20% of that place
actually supports human life so...

479
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:07,549
You're not seeing the big picture.
This is your new home.

480
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:11,414
The place where you will lead
a new life. This is the future, Gaius.

481
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:13,687
Now there's a depressing thought.

482
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,715
can you imagine if we actually
had to live on that thing.

483
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:20,513
You...

484
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,417
... are a genius.

485
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:25,056
And ?

486
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:27,802
Pay attention.
You're about to win the election.

487
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:32,145
We needed an issue, something
to set us apart from Roslin, this is it.

488
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:36,108
Permanent settlement on this planet.

489
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:40,005
<i>After 9 months of running from the Cylons,</i>

490
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:44,523
<i>I couldn't blame people for wanting
to feel solid beneath them once again.</i>

491
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:48,288
<i>Combined with the fact that the planet
was in a nebula and hidden from the Cylons,</i>

492
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:52,222
<i>it proved to be
a powerful temptation for a reary people.</i>

493
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:56,729
<i>I knew in my heart it was
the wrong decision but Baltar pressed on.</i>

494
00:36:56,842 --> 00:37:00,232
You see, I have long been a proponent
in the search for Earth.

495
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:03,546
The promise of perhaps finding
not only a new home,

496
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:06,247
but also the prospect
of discovering our long lost

497
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:09,361
brothers and sisters
of the 13th Colony is a powerful one.

498
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:12,375
But the trouble is,
the Cylons continue to follow us

499
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,779
since the destruction of the Colonies.

500
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,943
And if we have
a chance to stop this deadly chase,

501
00:37:18,242 --> 00:37:20,289
shouldn't we take it ?

502
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,345
My answer is yes.

503
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:28,120
<i>I feared Baltar's motives and I long
suspected him to be a Cylon collaborator.</i>

504
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,453
If you'll raise
your right hand and repeat after me.

505
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:36,895
<i>But his plans to settle on the new planet
drew overwhelming support from the voters</i>

506
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,186
<i>and he was elected President.</i>

507
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,310
And now,
because it was the first will of the people,

508
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:48,709
I'm going to sign
my first executive order

509
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:52,883
requiring
to immediatly establish settlements

510
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:56,038
on the planet we have come to know

511
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:58,592
as New Caprica.

512
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:09,047
<i>The Battlestar Galactica and the rest of the
fleet jumped together towards New Caprica.</i>

513
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:17,127
Send word to the Pegasus to launch
their initial ground team onto the surface.

514
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:21,343
Let's get a good look at our new home.
Gods help us all.

515
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:28,974
<i>As I'd feared,
the bitter conditions on New Caprica</i>

516
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:31,111
<i>made life difficult for all of us.</i>

517
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:34,354
<i>Supplies were scares, the climat was harsh.</i>

518
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:37,255
<i>But for one year,
we were safe from the Cylons</i>

519
00:38:37,368 --> 00:38:40,767
<i>and even I began to think
that this world was our new home.</i>

520
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:43,715
<i>Baltar's reign was an unhappy one.</i>

521
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,660
<i>Out of step with the needs of his people,
he became more dictator than president.</i>

522
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,228
<i>Our people began to organize
resistance against him and his move.</i>

523
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:57,481
When you realize
that the engine you've built

524
00:38:57,565 --> 00:39:01,546
is being used
for something so foul, so perverted,

525
00:39:01,743 --> 00:39:03,852
that it makes you sick in your heart

526
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,393
and it's then that
you must throw your body on the gears

527
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,234
and make it stop.

528
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:12,553
<i>As for me, I returned to teaching.</i>

529
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,886
Bye honey, thanks, good job.
You know what ?

530
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:20,203
Why don't you take the baby and go on.
Okay ? I'll finish up here.

531
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:22,710
- You sure ?
- Yes. Go ahead.

532
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:26,203
<i>I also continued to keep
a close watch on the Cylon child</i>

533
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:29,780
<i>whose existence was known
only to myself and a few others.</i>

534
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:32,418
- Have you seen Sam ?
- He's over there playing pyramid.

535
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:33,461
Thanks.

536
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:37,921
<i>Starbuck rescued Anders as she promised</i>

537
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:39,169
Sam, you idiot !

538
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:42,805
<i>The two of them left Galactica,
moved down to the planet and were married.</i>

539
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:45,997
You're sick, you're supposed to be in bed.

540
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,882
I can't believe
I married a moron, are you okay ?

541
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:52,586
I'm all right, I'm fine.

542
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,556
<i>The Battlestars Galactica and Pegasus</i>

543
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,818
<i>let a small patrol fleet
in orbit around New Caprica</i>

544
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,894
<i>just in case the Cylons returned.</i>

545
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:05,992
- Commander ?
- Yeah, lieutenant. What is it ?

546
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,541
I'm not sure,
I'm picking up something on Dradis.

547
00:40:10,704 --> 00:40:14,272
Dradis ? How can you
see anything in that soup ? I mean...

548
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,073
Oh my Gods, the Cylon fleet.

549
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:27,636
They found us.

550
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:35,508
<i>We have to get out of here, sir.</i>

551
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:37,504
We can't just leave all those people behind.

552
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,795
There's nothing we can do.

553
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:41,626
It's taken us forever
just to get to action stations over here.

554
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:43,415
<i>We're in no shape for a fight, sir.</i>

555
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,227
They'll be wiped out.

556
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,467
<i>We don't have a choice.
We need to get out of here right now !</i>

557
00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:52,594
Begin jump prep. We're leaving.

558
00:40:53,486 --> 00:40:55,120
But we'll be back.

559
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,942
Judgement day.

560
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:42,539
As long as you offer no resistance,

561
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:45,901
you won't be harmed.

562
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,520
- How do I know that ?
- You don't.

563
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:52,231
You also don't have any choice.

564
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,800
Very well...

565
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,556
On behalf of the people of the 12 Colonies,

566
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:11,209
I surrender.

567
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:22,125
<i>As I watched an army of Cylon Centurions</i>

568
00:42:22,182 --> 00:42:26,238
<i>march through our city I knew
our most difficult struggles lay ahead.</i>

569
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:32,792
<i>Now we face
an unknown future under Cylon occupation</i>

570
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:35,696
<i>with no word from Adama or the Galactica.</i>

571
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:41,612
<i>I pray to the Gods we still
have the strength to fight and to survive.</i>

572
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:48,488
What do you want to do now Captain ?

573
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,981
The same thing we always do,

574
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:57,530
fight them until we can't.

575
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:03,885
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )=-

576
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:09,894
Thanks to watch Battlestar Galactica
