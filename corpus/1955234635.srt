1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,703
Okay, I need you
to come in with the bride,

2
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:38,971
and make sure that
you get her entrance,

3
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,373
and, Vinny, I need
a good close-up of the "I do's".

4
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,708
That's what it's all about.

5
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,776
Back light on the bride?

6
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,090
She's the star.

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,247
<i>Code Blue, Libs.</i>

8
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,748
Hey. Is it something
you can minimize

9
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:50,949
until I get there?

10
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,284
<i>I'm trying.</i>

11
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,453
Okay, I'll be right there.

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,122
All right, I'm sorry, guys,
I gotta go.

13
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,792
Bridezilla's on the loose.

14
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,232
Hey, how bad is it?

15
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,634
I had to wrestle
the hairspray away from her.

16
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:09,802
Gosh,

17
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,003
they have months to get this
out of their system.

18
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,004
But it always happens

19
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,505
right before
they walk down the aisle.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,740
Will you do me a favor?

21
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,442
Will you check all the mics?
The sound guy is new.

22
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,777
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

23
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,092
Good luck.

24
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:25,017
Why would a hair stylist
say she could do a French twist

25
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,051
if she can't?

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,519
Where are the scissors?

27
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,594
Come here.

28
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,894
Look at yourself.

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,564
You look like a princess.

30
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,432
And your hair is perfect.

31
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,700
Seriously?

32
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,335
You look stunning.

33
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,206
Okay, close your eyes,

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,475
we're gonna take a deep breath,

35
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,444
and listen.

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,413
Do you hear the music?

37
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,683
They're playing Bach.

38
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,485
I love that.

39
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,652
That's your music.

40
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,421
You picked that.

41
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,735
Do you know what that means?

42
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,093
That means it's time, Samantha.

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,528
You're going to have
the best wedding

44
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,730
you have ever dreamed of.

45
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,132
And you are
the most beautiful bride

46
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,466
I have ever seen.

47
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,436
Now, are you ready

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,872
for the best day of your life?

49
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,207
I am.

50
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,209
Thank you.

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,156
<i>That is impressive.</i>

52
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,892
That is romance.

53
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,026
Okay, cue the dad, pronto.

54
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,180
Okay, now.

55
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,807
Hold the music, hold it...

56
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,975
Hold.

57
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Cue the music.

58
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,415
Now.

59
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,951
And we are on our way

60
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,220
to another perfectly
planned wedding by Libby.

61
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,921
Yeah.

62
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,226
Lots of cute single guys here.

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,227
My gosh, Michelle.

64
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,528
What?

65
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,429
Good luck with that,
I'm still working.

66
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,431
So are you.

67
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,532
Hello.

68
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,400
We can look, can't we?

69
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,226
Here we go.
Keep it rolling.

70
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,095
All right, ladies,
ready to catch the bouquet?

71
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,532
Okay, who's ready?

72
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,052
Don't look now,

73
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,587
but a super handsome groomsman

74
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,988
is checking you out.

75
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,724
No, I do not
think so, 'Chelle.

76
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,760
I think

77
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,794
he's gonna ask you to dance.

78
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,795
Right? Really?
Yeah. Okay.

79
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,596
I'd put
money on it.

80
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,866
I just want to say,

81
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,401
this was the most beautiful,

82
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,669
incredible...

83
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,770
Spectacular wedding...

84
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,937
...That I have ever been to.

85
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,938
We.

86
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,973
...We have ever been to.

87
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,474
Thank you, guys.

88
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,676
We're really glad
that you're enjoying it.

89
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,010
I don't know how you do it.

90
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,179
I mean, you gave
Samantha, like...

91
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,847
Everything?

92
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,482
It's like a total
dream come true.

93
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,951
Aw, well, that's what
we do, so we're glad.

94
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,688
We actually just
got engaged last month.

95
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,489
You caught the bouquet.

96
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,524
Congratulations,

97
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,825
that's great.

98
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,859
Thank you.

99
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,795
You know, we'd be thrilled

100
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,662
if you'd consider
planning our wedding.

101
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,731
We would love to, yes.

102
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,765
This is our card,

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,100
give us a call.

104
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,468
But don't wait too long,

105
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,603
Libby's schedule
fills up quickly.

106
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,505
Thank you.

107
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,174
It was nice meeting
you guys, thank you.

108
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,475
Thank you.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

109
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,443
Talk to you soon.

110
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,011
Bye.

111
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,045
Hey?

112
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,147
Hey. Good job.

113
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,182
I'll toast to that.

114
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,553
Man, if I had a boyfriend,

115
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,887
this is exactly
the wedding I'd want.

116
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,790
You and me both.

117
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,359
Excuse me.

118
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,827
Would you like to dance?

119
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,199
I promise I won't
step on your toes.

120
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,900
And it's okay
if you step on mine.

121
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:11,870
Told you.

122
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:12,904
She would love to.

123
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,872
She'd love to.

124
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,207
Yes, thank you.

125
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,077
I am so sorry to interrupt.

126
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,812
I need you. The caterers
are having a meltdown.

127
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,813
I don't know what to do.

128
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,081
I'm sorry, I'm still working.

129
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,249
It was nice
meeting you. Thank you.

130
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,550
Thank you.

131
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,354
But I don't even...
know your name.

132
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,027
Did you pay the vendor fee
for the wedding expo?

133
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,595
Not yet.

134
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,933
So, I was going through
the books last night.

135
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,468
Okay, and?

136
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:18,904
And...

137
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,572
Our cash is down to a trickle.

138
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,674
This couple
is heaven sent.

139
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,543
The timing couldn't be
more perfect.

140
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,411
I sincerely doubt we'll get
to do what we just did

141
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,780
for the Jenkins wedding,
but you never know.

142
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,249
Well, these two
seem so meant for each other.

143
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,118
What approach are you thinking?

144
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,387
What I always do,

145
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,661
find out what their dream is
and make it happen.

146
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,325
I just hope I can give them
everything they want.

147
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,360
I just hope
they give us a check.

148
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,701
All I know is whatever happens...

149
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,996
...we can't afford
to lose this job.

150
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,139
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, guys.

151
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,106
Come on in.

152
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,374
You guys are right on time.

153
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,375
I like that.

154
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,376
It's so nice to see you.

155
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,247
Okay, let's start
at the beginning.

156
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,249
Where did you two meet?

157
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,851
At work.

158
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,985
We work for
the same start-up company.

159
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,454
Alex is a computer programmer,

160
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,289
I do the graphics.

161
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,257
Nice.

162
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,258
Sometimes, I like
to tie the venue

163
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,926
to where the couple met,

164
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,294
but I don't really
think an office

165
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,629
is the wedding vibe
we're going for.

166
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,700
Well, where did you go
on your first date?

167
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,635
We went on a harbor cruise.

168
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,604
We had our first kiss
on the bow...

169
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,839
just like in "Titanic".

170
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,441
That's so romantic.

171
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,611
Well, let's talk food.
What kind of cuisine do you like?

172
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,646
Pretty much anything.

173
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,118
We're gonna have to
narrow that down.

174
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,488
How about D.J. or band?

175
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,523
Yes.

176
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,892
Okay, great.
Which one?

177
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,496
I thought you just meant
do we want a D.J. or a band,

178
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,132
and yes, we want one of those.

179
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,634
Yes, I... I agree.

180
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,736
Okay, I know there are
a lot of decisions

181
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,904
that you have to make,

182
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,540
and in the beginning,
it can be really stressful.

183
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,243
Which is why we're here,
to help you make those decisions.

184
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,411
When you work with
"Weddings by Libby,"

185
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,280
we vow to give you
the perfect wedding.

186
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,385
That... that's a joke.

187
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,786
A wedding vow?

188
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,924
Look, I have to be honest.

189
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,692
We are totally overwhelmed.

190
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,995
Yeah, sometimes, we think
we should just skip the stress

191
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,164
and go down to City Hall.

192
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,134
Look, my mom and dad
did just that.

193
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,201
They never had a real wedding,

194
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,970
and that's something
they've always regretted.

195
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,004
I don't want that
to happen to you.

196
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,719
I wish the Bridal Expo
happened more than once a year.

197
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,954
Yeah, me too.

198
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,355
At this point,
we could use it monthly.

199
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,790
Check that, weekly.

200
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,392
Well, I'm excited
to see Alex and Annie.

201
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,994
Yeah.

202
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,662
They were so close
to signing a contract.

203
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,997
Do you think they'll be here?

204
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,031
Definitely.

205
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,366
They promised.

206
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,709
Look at this craziness.

207
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,744
How am I supposed to compete?

208
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,880
You can compete 'cause you're
not selling dresses or cakes.

209
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,618
You're selling your book,
a future bestseller.

210
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,820
You don't need
a fancy set-up.

211
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,321
If you say so.

212
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,958
Okay, lift it...

213
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,693
'Chelle, I need you to lift.

214
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,462
Here, let me help you.

215
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,696
Thanks.

216
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,831
A little higher.

217
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,032
Got it.

218
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,066
Wow. Thank you
for that.

219
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,469
You're a life saver...

220
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,671
Hey, it's you.

221
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,774
I thought I'd never
going to see you again.

222
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,576
I know, me too.

223
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,244
I'm actually glad
you're around.

224
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,358
We needed some muscle.

225
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,882
Well, Ben Reynolds
at your service.

226
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,851
Your booth is really impressive.

227
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,420
Thanks, but,
that's all Michelle.

228
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,388
She's a tech genius.

229
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,624
But she's the people person
who makes it all go.

230
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,693
Anything that speaks
to the heart is all Libby.

231
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,595
You're not getting a raise
for that.

232
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,363
I would never.

233
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,868
Well, besides saving the day,
what do you do?

234
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,403
Well, I'm a writer.

235
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,205
Well, I just wrote
my first book,

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,640
"Wedding Day Do's and Don'ts".

237
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,810
That sounds like a really
good read, right up my alley.

238
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,246
So, tell me something,

239
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,614
I know you're a good dancer,

240
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,382
but I don't even know your name.

241
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,418
Libby Boland.

242
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,086
As in "Weddings by Libby".

243
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,256
Nice to officially meet you,
"Weddings by Libby".

244
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,325
Nice to meet you, too,
"Book by Ben".

245
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,263
You know where my booth is,
so if you ever need anything...

246
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,531
come on by.

247
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,966
Thanks, yeah, I'll do that.

248
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,170
Hey,
"Weddings by Libby"...

249
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,204
this booth isn't gonna
set itself up.

250
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,207
Right.

251
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,278
Thank you, again.

252
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,180
That was so nice of you.

253
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,550
I'm gonna go.

254
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,019
My pleasure.

255
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,989
I'm just gonna be over here.

256
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:05,984
If you need me.

257
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,127
Little help over here?

258
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,162
Anytime...
you wanna help.

259
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,431
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

260
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,342
Here you are.

261
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,677
How's it going?

262
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,245
Amazing.

263
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,613
I've been so busy,

264
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,581
I haven't even had a chance
to have lunch.

265
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,750
I know, I always forget
to eat at these things.

266
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,753
Actually, I was kidding.

267
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,821
I haven't even sold a book,

268
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,057
and I'm starting to think
coming here was a terrible idea.

269
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,826
I'm sure you're just
off to a slow start.

270
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,861
It'll get better.

271
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,564
Come on, I'll introduce you
to some people.

272
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,401
Are people going to remember
your bridesmaid dresses?

273
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,836
No.

274
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,338
Your invitations?

275
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,406
No way.

276
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,542
But your guests
will remember your cake

277
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,476
if...

278
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,147
it is a Cake Kyng wedding cake.

279
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,749
There you go.

280
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,084
It certainly looks amazing.

281
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,720
His cakes are like
little slices of melted heaven.

282
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,355
Please, be my guests.

283
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,025
You know better
than that, Libby.

284
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,660
Wedding style, please.

285
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,234
My God...

286
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,769
That's got to be the best
cake I've ever tasted.

287
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,870
And always remember,

288
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,605
the proof is in the pudding,
and the pudding...

289
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,340
"... Is in the cake!"

290
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,575
That's my girl.

291
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,111
Dear.

292
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,148
We are "Body by Bobby".

293
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,451
I'm Bobby D,
and this is Bobby G.

294
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,554
And we want you to look
your best for your wedding!

295
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,423
Brides-to-be,
when your big day rolls around,

296
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,293
do you wanna be fat
or do you wanna be fit?

297
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,427
They scare me.

298
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,428
Yeah. Me too.

299
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,429
Come on!

300
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,932
Holy...

301
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,467
Okay, let's go.

302
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,239
There's no way that this is
that guy's first rodeo.

303
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,975
It's not hers, either.

304
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,376
I'd say this is about
her third go-around.

305
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,377
You think?

306
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,379
I know.
I planned her second wedding.

307
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,089
So, you've been
to this thing before?

308
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,058
It's my third year.

309
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,293
It's kind of the best way
to drum up new business,

310
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,796
since there aren't really
a lot of repeat customers

311
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,598
in the wedding game.

312
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,732
It's your first year?

313
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,900
Yeah, yeah.

314
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,468
My publisher signed me up,

315
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,203
thought it was a good way
to create more buzz.

316
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,138
To be honest,

317
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,474
I've actually never seen
an author here before,

318
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,510
but I think that actually
makes you a trailblazer, so...

319
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,946
Right, yeah.

320
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,349
No, I certainly feel like
I'm in the wilderness.

321
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,885
It's a lot bigger
than I expected.

322
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,888
So what's this book of yours all
about?

323
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,156
Weddings, of course.

324
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,792
I had a theory,
the do's and the don'ts,

325
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,295
and went with it,
and here I am.

326
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,664
Okay, and what is
this theory of yours?

327
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,300
Well, I believe...

328
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,269
what you do or don't do
on your wedding day...

329
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,343
will affect
the rest of your marriage.

330
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:07,912
I completely agree.

331
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,745
So, what do you do when
you're not planning weddings?

332
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,883
Actually, "Weddings by Libby"
is pretty much a 24-7 job.

333
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,485
But I feed my goldfish.

334
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,621
And once a month,
I go ballroom dancing.

335
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,623
What?
Get out of here, no way.

336
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,824
Yeah.

337
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,159
I dance, too.

338
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,594
Every Thursday night
at Monty's Ballroom.

339
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,849
Perhaps there's more
dancing in our future.

340
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,799
We'll see.

341
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,537
Come and see one of my favorite
dresses of the season.

342
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,840
You are going to love it.

343
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,545
Isn't it exquisite?

344
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,347
It's gorgeous.

345
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,683
It's absolutely beautiful.

346
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,451
Careful, honey.

347
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,254
It's bad luck to show the groom
the dress before the big day.

348
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,489
No, it's okay,
we're just friends.

349
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,892
Really?

350
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,394
Because you're
such a lovely couple.

351
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,735
<i>Welcome, everybody, welcome!</i>

352
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,304
<i>Is everybody ready and excited
to kick off the first panel</i>

353
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,440
<i>of this year's Bridal Expo?</i>

354
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,076
Give me a kiss.

355
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,112
<i>Well, I've gotta tell you,</i>

356
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,680
<i>we have got the best
vendors around,</i>

357
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,681
<i>and they are all here...</i>

358
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,249
I met those two
at the Jenkinsons' wedding.

359
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,318
They are so in love.

360
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,653
Believe me, I know.

361
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,521
Alex was my roommate in college.

362
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,091
Shut up, that's crazy.

363
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,593
Scout's honor.

364
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,962
They're not
the only ones in love.

365
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,297
Look around...

366
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,851
endorphins firing
everywhere I look.

367
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,571
<i>Now, our first speaker today,
she is an absolute gem.</i>

368
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,808
She's our favorite wedding planner,
the one, the only, Miss Libby Boland.

369
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,755
Brides and grooms-to-be,
everything starts with the wedding.

370
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,191
That day should be
perfectly romantic,

371
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,593
and exactly what you want.

372
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,863
I don't want you
to look back and say,

373
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,766
"Well,
it was nearly perfect".

374
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,936
Every detail, from the venue,
to the caterer, to the cake,

375
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,938
should be exactly what you want.

376
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,610
Expecting perfection
is not expecting too much.

377
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,546
You only get married once.
Well, most of you.

378
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,985
I insist only on one thing...

379
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,054
...let your wedding day...

380
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,190
...be the wedding
you've always dreamed of.

381
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,692
No expense should be spared.

382
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,928
I promise you...

383
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,764
...no dream is too big.

384
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,067
Thank you.

385
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,106
<i>Isn't she something.
Thank you, Libby Boland.</i>

386
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,375
<i>Well, now,
let's get ready to welcome</i>

387
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,610
<i>a newcomer to the wedding game,</i>

388
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,579
<i>long-time and successful
financial planner,</i>

389
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,648
<i>he's just written
his very first book,</i>

390
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,018
<i>the soon to be bestseller
"Wedding Do's and Don'ts",</i>

391
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,520
<i>please welcome Mr. Ben Reynolds.</i>

392
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,801
As I look across this room,
I see a lot of smiling faces.

393
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:28,806
Faces filled with love,
maybe even fear.

394
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:29,874
"Will the food
be good enough?"

395
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,376
"Will everyone
have fun?"

396
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,779
"Will my wedding be
as good as my sister's?"

397
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,915
The decisions you make today

398
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,685
and in the weeks leading up to
your big event,

399
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,321
well, they'll determine
how you live for years to come.

400
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,755
And my question is...

401
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,592
...are you willing to sacrifice
your financial future...

402
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,626
...for one day?

403
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,297
"Wedding Day Do's and Don'ts"...

404
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,235
it's a guide to help with
all the hard choices.

405
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,470
I know right it seems like
everything has to be perfect,

406
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,440
and it's easy to get
caught up in the hype

407
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,942
and all the shiny objects.

408
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,046
But marriage,
it's about a life together,

409
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,449
so let's get realistic
here, folks,

410
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,452
and if I may be
completely honest,

411
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,454
it's time to dump the big event.

412
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,958
Thank you.

413
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,298
Well, you can't have a wedding

414
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,466
without a delicious cake,
am I right?

415
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,769
If there's one person that
can deliver on that promise,

416
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,038
it's our very own Cake Kyng.

417
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,072
Come on up here.

418
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,276
Yeah, thank you.

419
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,277
What's that?

420
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:45,049
Real-life experience, yeah.
You've got to do it to learn, right?

421
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,384
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

422
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,152
Ben, can I see you for a second?

423
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,153
Pardon me. Pardon me.

424
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,889
Hey, that was spectacular.

425
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,857
It was better than
I ever expected.

426
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,858
Spectacular? Really?

427
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,126
Are you kidding?

428
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,928
You really got people
talking around here.

429
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,196
You know what I think,

430
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,665
I think you're going to blow up
this whole wedding game.

431
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,066
That seems like an exaggeration.

432
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,601
Ben, I was in the audience.

433
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,102
You didn't see all
the people nodding along?

434
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:09,874
You are the alternative choice,
and that, my friend, sells books.

435
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,908
I'm the alternative choice?

436
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,543
The alternative choice you are.

437
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,111
Come on, we gotta get you
back in the booth,

438
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,580
you've got autographs to sign.

439
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,715
All right, sweet.

440
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,116
Yeah. Let's do that.

441
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,826
So, Libby, I...

442
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,695
I really don't feel like talking
right now.

443
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,673
Why are you following me?

444
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,675
I'm not following you.

445
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,882
Obviously you're upset,
and I'm sorry,

446
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,017
I don't know
what I said exactly.

447
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,519
"Dump the big event?"

448
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,621
Is that really what you said?

449
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,355
Because I'm pretty sure
I heard it.

450
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,090
Right.

451
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,825
I was actually a little
worried about that line,

452
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,859
but it did seem
to resonate, right?

453
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,597
You do realize that
we're at a "Bridal Expo"?

454
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,699
We sell the big event.

455
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,735
It's all about the big event.

456
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,370
We don't dump said big event.

457
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,872
Bridal Expo, right,

458
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,541
that would explain all
the white dresses downstairs.

459
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,509
Yeah, that would
explain the dresses,

460
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,344
and the florists,
and the caterers,

461
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,846
and the venue representatives,

462
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,414
and you know,
and wedding planners.

463
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,417
Everyone here, myself included,

464
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,153
we make a living
because of "the big event,"

465
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,255
so thank you very much.

466
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,362
I'm just offering
a different perspective.

467
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,132
A "small event" perspective.

468
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,367
Well, that's not gonna work.

469
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,502
Last year's theme was
"Go big or go home".

470
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,071
So, please, go home.

471
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,917
Let's think outside of the box.

472
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,553
Have you guys considered
Franklin Gardens?

473
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,721
Where's that?

474
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,889
Hawaii.

475
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,957
Place looks incredible.

476
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,827
Here is the tropical garden,
where you could say your vows.

477
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,263
This resort offers everything,

478
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,298
specialty shops,
multiple restaurants.

479
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,900
They even a heart-shaped pool.

480
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,838
This is a one-of-a-kind experience
for you and your guests,

481
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,107
a romantic weekend wedding
that you will never forget.

482
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,010
You will absolutely love
Franklin Gardens.

483
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,912
I swear, it's like they've trained
their birds to chirp on cue.

484
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,816
And Cassandra,
the spa is to die for.

485
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,951
It's how every bride should be
pampered before her wedding day.

486
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,120
That does sound amazing.

487
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,722
Sorry.

488
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,023
Alex, Annie!

489
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,025
Hey, Michelle has
the contract for you to sign.

490
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,661
Actually, we're just heading to
an event, but we'll come by after.

491
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,529
Of course. Have fun.

492
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,497
All right.

493
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,832
- See you.
- See you.

494
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,600
Sorry about that.

495
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,634
So, if this is something
that interests you,

496
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,836
I would suggest
picking a date now,

497
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,471
because they get
completely booked.

498
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:57,241
It's a lovely place,
but...

499
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,679
We saw Ben Reynolds
speak, and...

500
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,747
afterwards, we bought his book.

501
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,815
It's like he says
in the first chapter,

502
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,385
"I don't see what
all the big fuss is about".

503
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,788
Well, Daniel,
the "fuss" is the fact

504
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,823
that this is your one
and only wedding day.

505
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,658
Something you'll cherish
for the rest of your life.

506
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,293
She does have a point.

507
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,329
But, Honey, I...

508
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,363
just don't think we're ready
to make that decision.

509
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,033
Can we talk to you tomorrow?

510
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,069
Of course.

511
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,170
Great.

512
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,171
Thanks again.

513
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,172
Thank you.

514
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,206
Talk to you soon.

515
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,146
What just happened?

516
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I'll tell you
what just happened.

517
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,984
We lost a client, and they lost
the wedding of their dreams.

518
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,297
...You can spend thousands of
dollars for a resort near the water,

519
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,266
or you could get married
on the beach

520
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,060
with a permit that costs
a few hundred bucks.

521
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,503
Thank you.

522
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,519
In other words, the resort is
a "Don't" and the beach is a "Do".

523
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,876
Hi.

524
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:10,333
Hey, everyone, have you met
"Weddings by Libby"?

525
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,383
Thank you, "Book by Ben".

526
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,318
Hi, everyone.

527
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,020
"Weddings by Libby"
is down on your left.

528
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,923
The place
where dreams come true.

529
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,160
No hard feelings?

530
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,161
Not one.

531
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,530
On the house.

532
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,632
Please, I insist.

533
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:30,768
Would you like me to sign it?

534
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,102
No, thank you.

535
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,103
Can I take you to dinner?

536
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,205
I'll take a rain check.

537
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,272
Everybody's got to eat.

538
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,975
I think we did pretty well
for our first day.

539
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,711
We've got at least
six interested couples, and...

540
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,215
Libby...

541
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,917
you want to... focus here
for a few minutes?

542
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,221
"Consider the bang
for your buck.

543
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,190
Does a limo get you there
any better than... "

544
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,665
Seriously, who pays
$16.95 for this?

545
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,632
Except for me,
'cause I'm doing research.

546
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,574
So it's one of those,
"Know your competition" things?

547
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:11,709
My gosh, he's not
our competition.

548
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,612
He has a little book he's selling.
So what?

549
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,679
So you do care what he thinks?

550
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,947
I don't.

551
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,049
Clearly, you do.

552
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,651
No, everybody's
talking about it,

553
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,387
and I figured
it can't hurt to read it.

554
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,023
Give me a break.

555
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,658
Listen to this.

556
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,860
"When shopping for
the bridesmaids' dresses,

557
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,263
"consider something
elegant but versatile.

558
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,797
"Let's face it,

559
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,566
"you pick some crazy color
to match your place settings,

560
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
and those dresses
will never be worn again".

561
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,538
He can't be serious.

562
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,806
There's a reason that
you pick a color scheme.

563
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,242
Well, he is kind of right
about never wearing it again.

564
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,711
I've got three dresses

565
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,027
that will forever remain
in the back of my closet.

566
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,718
We are...

567
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,388
"Body... by Bobby".

568
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,389
Are you ready!

569
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,790
Let's go, on my count!

570
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,958
One! Two!

571
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,192
And punch.

572
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,696
One, two, three...

573
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,731
He's suggesting
that the bride and groom

574
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,366
have a friend go down
to the flower mart

575
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,303
the night before the wedding
and purchase flowers.

576
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,607
So the flowers are a "Do,"
but the florist is a 'Don't"?

577
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,375
Yeah, and then
he expects these amateurs

578
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,843
to actually arrange the flowers.

579
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,179
He says it will get more people
involved in the ceremony.

580
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,981
What a joke.

581
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,318
"Music", the more you
add, the more it costs.

582
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,387
"You start with a soloist and
a string quartet at the ceremony,

583
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,623
"then a band or a D.J.
for the reception.

584
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,491
Instead, create a song list...

585
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,561
I'm sorry, is he actually
suggesting pulling out an iPod...

586
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,662
...and hitting shuffle?

587
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,431
- Yes!
- Ooh...

588
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,299
"If you control the music,

589
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,235
you never have to worry about
the chicken dance again".

590
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,371
Well, the chicken dance
is awkward.

591
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,073
Are you agreeing with him?

592
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,910
See? It's a little awkward.

593
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,244
Don't do that.

594
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,212
Do not do that.

595
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,982
It's awkward!

596
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,485
Wow, your twitter feed
is really blowing up.

597
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,587
What are they saying?

598
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,055
Cindy B tweeted,

599
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,257
"Blown away by the panel,
loved Libby's speech".

600
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,395
Purplesky says, "Weddings
By Libby" had the best booth.

601
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,598
It's where creativity meets
wedding awesome-ness".

602
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,700
Well, Purplesky is brilliant.

603
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,202
I'll say so.

604
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:22,206
There are also a lot of tweets
linked to the Bridal Expo page.

605
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,141
All pretty good.

606
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,043
"Libby rocks".

607
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,512
"Libby is still
the queen of the ball".

608
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,715
What?

609
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,050
It's nothing.

610
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,585
It's just...

611
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,787
Well, they can't all be good.
I can take it.

612
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:44,361
From PattyCakes,
"The big wedding is old school.

613
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,598
"The trend at the Expo
is to dump the big event".

614
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:48,732
"Old School?"
How is it old school?

615
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,967
She wrote that on our page?

616
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,705
Actually, it was retweeted.

617
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,340
From guess who?

618
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,208
Yeah, no, I know who it is.

619
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,578
He's got a ton of hits
on his twitter following, too...

620
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,080
You know, good for him.

621
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,154
Good for him,
let's just start fresh.

622
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,317
Okay.

623
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,652
Facebook page.

624
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,688
I posted a lot of new pictures.

625
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,922
Good.

626
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,724
We got 132 likes.

627
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,225
Nice.

628
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,361
Including Ben Reynolds.

629
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,796
What?

630
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,830
He liked our page?

631
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,766
Why does that surprise you?

632
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,368
He likes you.

633
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,402
My gosh...

634
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,671
And you like him.

635
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,174
I do not like him.

636
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,209
Okay, Libs,

637
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,523
if you say so.

638
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,513
I should go.

639
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,748
We have another
early start tomorrow morning.

640
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,454
Okay, even if I did like him,
it couldn't ever work.

641
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,955
I mean, we're
complete opposites.

642
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,491
Well, opposites attract.

643
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,692
It's impossible.

644
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,429
Everything I stand for,
everything I love, he hates.

645
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,633
Libs...

646
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,205
please listen to me.

647
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,242
You spend all of your energy making
your clients' dreams come true.

648
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:10,781
You live through the romance
of other people.

649
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,583
When are you going to stop
running the show

650
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,618
and let yourself fall in love?

651
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,486
You like this guy.

652
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,925
So, for once,
why not follow your heart?

653
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,908
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

654
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,378
I saw that you liked
our Facebook page.

655
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,213
I did.

656
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,416
That was nice.
Thank you.

657
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,731
You're welcome.

658
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,990
I read your book last night.

659
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,926
I don't agree with much of the
content, but you write well.

660
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,628
Thank you.

661
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,662
I think.

662
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,230
Did you major in English?

663
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,767
I majored in economics
and philosophy.

664
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,604
Is that where you formulated your
theories on love and marriage?

665
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,040
No, that came later.

666
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,710
Going my way?

667
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,317
If it isn't the happy couple.

668
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,085
Still not getting married?

669
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,487
No.

670
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,422
Well, that's too bad.

671
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,225
You make such a lovely pair.

672
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,504
Thank you.

673
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,410
So, what made you decide
to be "Weddings by Libby"?

674
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,644
Really?

675
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,013
Yeah, I want to know.

676
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,949
Okay.

677
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,085
When I was six years old,

678
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,855
I was a flower girl
in my aunt's wedding.

679
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,858
I was so excited,
I got to wear a dressy dress,

680
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,561
and get my hair done,
and carry a bouquet.

681
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,130
I bet you made
a really cute flower girl.

682
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,685
Please.
I was adorable.

683
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,904
So, you're six years old,

684
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,740
you're a flower girl,
and you found your calling?

685
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,774
I didn't finish my story.

686
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,376
Please, go on.

687
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,845
So, after the wedding
came the reception,

688
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,948
and, it was like
this enchanted world,

689
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,852
of music, and dancing, and food.

690
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,520
They even had this
special kids' table,

691
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,892
and it had hot dogs, pineapple
pizza, and fruity drinks.

692
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,793
I found my happy place.

693
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,695
So, like I said,
you're six years old,

694
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,963
you're a flower girl,

695
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,565
and you found your calling.

696
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,233
Well, yeah, but I had to
talk about the reception,

697
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,568
It makes the story pop.

698
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,435
It does make it pop...

699
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,703
Thank you.

700
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,039
And it's nice to know that
you're impressed by hot dogs,

701
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,407
pineapple pizza,
and fruity drinks.

702
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,109
I was six.

703
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,181
Hi! Libby...

704
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,017
I loved you on the panel.

705
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,451
Thank you.

706
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,552
Mind if I ask you a question?

707
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,487
Of course not.

708
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,123
Well, my fiance and I...

709
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,791
...were thinking about
having a wedding on a train.

710
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:11,194
Do you think that would be
a romantic way to get married?

711
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,696
One of the most romantic
weddings I ever planned

712
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,697
was at a train station.

713
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,400
And if you guys want to travel
to a new destination,

714
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,369
you could rent a whole car
or several cars.

715
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,605
So, how much does it cost
to rent one of those cars?

716
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,774
I mean, it depends.

717
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,777
You have to factor in the time
of year, and the amount of people,

718
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,051
and how many hours you'd want.

719
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,261
Ben...
what's your take?

720
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,953
Well, I... I don't know much

721
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,355
about the cost
of renting a train,

722
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,823
but if you've read my book,

723
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,558
you'll see
that I'm a big proponent

724
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,226
of combining activities
and function.

725
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,795
So, if trains are your thing,

726
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,765
then you could have the ceremony
on the way to the honeymoon.

727
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,835
Ben, do you think that same
idea would work in Vegas?

728
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,836
I don't see why not.

729
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,006
Trains run 24/7
to the downtown heart of Vegas.

730
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,142
It's Vegas, baby. Why not
just get married by Elvis?

731
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,478
Why not? I like Elvis.

732
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,746
And it could make for
some fun wedding photos.

733
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,349
I'm sorry, but Elvis
is not romantic at all.

734
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,383
You do believe in romance,
don't you?

735
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,455
Well, big budget
doesn't mean romance.

736
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,622
You can make
any situation romantic.

737
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,373
I am sorry, Ben, but you do not know
the first thing about romance.

738
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,100
Pardon me, folks,
I will be right back.

739
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,705
Hey, wait.

740
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,574
There's no reason
to get personal.

741
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:31,775
You intentionally undermined me.

742
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:32,943
I did not.

743
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,645
When you sit there and say,
"Why spend money...

744
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,414
"... on an event that
you're gonna remember forever...

745
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,049
...when you can have
a quickie wedding in Sin City?"

746
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,984
That is undermining
my expertise.

747
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,919
I was asked my opinion.

748
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,688
All I offered
was an alternative answer.

749
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,657
Well, congratulations, you had
a theory, and you wrote a book.

750
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,925
Weddings are my life,

751
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,695
and I for one am not interested
in your alternative choices.

752
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,698
So please, take your boyish smile
and your charming personality,

753
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,701
and go find a woman who
enjoys being married by Elvis.

754
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:02,205
Boyish smile
and charming personality?

755
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,675
Thank you?

756
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,644
I think.

757
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,816
This is new,
a magician at the reception?

758
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,752
Alex, your brother would just
love that, don't you think?

759
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,255
Probably. Luckily it's
our wedding, not his.

760
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,557
Everybody loves magic.
Want to see a demo, folks?

761
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,559
Sure.

762
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,760
All right.

763
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,715
And you guys
are getting married?

764
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,635
Wedding rings.

765
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,537
Free of charge.

766
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,073
Want to see another trick?

767
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,275
I could watch this all day.

768
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,045
Not unless
you can make people disappear.

769
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,483
Is this where you got your
inspiration for David and Samantha?

770
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,486
Well, some of it, but mostly
from learning about them.

771
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,455
Just like I'm getting
to know the two of you.

772
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,257
See, the idea is to customize
the wedding to your dream.

773
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,626
So, if you want fireworks,
fireworks it is.

774
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,962
If you want
big, beautiful centerpieces,

775
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,230
then you should have that.

776
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,399
The important thing to think
about is what makes you happy?

777
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,433
No regrets.

778
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,504
Well, happy is knowing that
I'm marrying my best friend.

779
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,407
You guys are so sweet.

780
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,375
I loved what
you did for Samantha.

781
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,078
The way she arrived in that beautiful
Bentley, it was like a fairy tale.

782
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,150
Why don't you guys go down
to Cake Kyng's booth,

783
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,152
get started with some samples?

784
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,226
I'll meet you there
in a few minutes.

785
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,323
Okay.

786
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,865
Yesterday, we met with
"Weddings by Libby".

787
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,100
Great,
but expensive.

788
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,335
I understand.

789
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,971
And you said you want to have
kids, and kids are expensive,

790
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,874
so let's plan
an affordable wedding.

791
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,710
Sounds great.
So glad we found you.

792
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,744
Me too.

793
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,584
I'll just be a moment.
Excuse me, folks.

794
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,991
What is this?

795
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,493
Wedding consultant?

796
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,761
Yes.

797
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,230
"Wedding Consultant",
what exactly is it?

798
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,432
Well, a lot of people
were asking for my advice,

799
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,902
so I thought
I'd branch out.

800
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,670
Do you know what you're doing?

801
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,406
Consulting?

802
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,275
You are stealing my clients!

803
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,878
They...

804
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,514
Sir, I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

805
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,283
Okay. Why would that be?

806
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,985
Well, I own the best,
and only,

807
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,787
Drive-Thru Wedding Chapel
in all of Nevada,

808
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:34,457
and since your Vegas
shout-out at the panel,

809
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,560
I actually had people
stopping by my booth.

810
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,929
I've been coming to this expo
for 10 years

811
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,298
and I have never had
so much foot traffic.

812
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:45,268
No, wait a minute, it's a
drive-thru wedding chapel?

813
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,269
Like, a fast food drive-thru?

814
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,270
Exactly.

815
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,639
It used to be a bank,
I converted it.

816
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,274
You don't even have to
get out of your car.

817
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,275
Interesting.

818
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,078
This is classic.

819
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,381
If it's even possible, you have
reached the absolute bottom.

820
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,051
Wait, okay, so a drive-thru
wedding isn't for everybody...

821
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,253
Well, good
enough for you?

822
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,255
If I was in a rush, yes.

823
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,060
You know what, I do not want
you to like my Facebook page.

824
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,174
I'm not even sure
we should be friends.

825
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,431
Facebook friends
or real friends?

826
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,800
Take your pick.

827
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,310
I hope we haven't
caused you a problem.

828
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,545
No worries.

829
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,980
Every problem has a solution.

830
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,050
I hope.

831
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:38,188
And this one is called
"The Fairy Princess"...

832
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,543
...and here she comes now.

833
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,295
I need chocolate.
Immediately.

834
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:48,965
My gosh...

835
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,768
Libby?

836
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:52,802
Are you okay?

837
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,138
You look like you've seen
Frankenstein's bride.

838
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,873
I'm fine.

839
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,875
This is delicious.

840
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,211
And you know it's delicious

841
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,146
because "The proof
is in the pudding, and... "

842
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,082
"The pudding
is in the cake".

843
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,527
Wedding dress shopping
is always my favorite part.

844
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,197
More than anything else, the dress
makes a woman feel like a bride.

845
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,834
- They're all so beautiful.
- I know, right?

846
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,336
In my opinion, this is
the hardest decision

847
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,337
you're going to have to make,

848
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,638
because they have
so many options.

849
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:33,510
You have classic, A-line,
long, short, elegant, sassy...

850
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,400
I notice there's,
no prices on these dresses.

851
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,593
You have marvelous taste.

852
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:54,497
That is an haute couture Nena
Lang with a pleated bodice.

853
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,534
You would look absolutely
radiant in that dress.

854
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,103
In fact, we're doing
a Bridal fashion show today,

855
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:04,040
and I would love to see you on the
runway modeling that very dress.

856
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,742
Really?

857
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,410
Me? A model?

858
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,079
Come back at 4:00,
we'll get you ready.

859
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,447
We'll do your hair and makeup.

860
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,615
That's fantastic.

861
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,584
Then you get to see
what you look like first-hand

862
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,420
as a beautiful bride.

863
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,822
Honey?
What do you think?

864
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,923
It's...

865
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,291
It's amazing.

866
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,099
<i>Thank you.</i>

867
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,400
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

868
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,470
<i>You are about to see the newest</i>

869
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,472
<i>and most exquisite
wedding dresses available</i>

870
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,673
<i>in the market today.</i>

871
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,208
<i>So, here we go,</i>

872
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,145
<i>the hottest trends
in dream dresses.</i>

873
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,388
<i>First up</i>

874
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,724
<i>is an ivory strapless
princess-style dress</i>

875
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,893
<i>with a Chantilly lace bodice.</i>

876
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,163
<i>Isn't she lovely?</i>

877
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,867
How's
the groom-to-be?

878
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,969
I got problems, my brother.

879
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,270
Problems?
What do you mean?

880
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,271
You're in love.

881
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,672
Yeah, exactly.

882
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,974
This wedding is going
to break the bank.

883
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,576
<i>...high-low gown
with a removable skirt.</i>

884
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,514
<i>And those of you who like
the sweetheart neckline,</i>

885
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:21,785
this one comes with a lovely
antique lace overlay.

886
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,887
I mean, Annie wants the biggest
and best of everything,

887
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,988
and I don't want
to disappoint her.

888
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,589
<i>And now for my favorite.</i>

889
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,059
<i>This dress is a Nena Lang.</i>

890
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,665
<i>This has a pleated bodice
and a spectacular mermaid skirt.</i>

891
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,834
<i>Absolutely stunning, isn't it?</i>

892
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,803
All right, look
at that dress. Beautiful.

893
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,372
Do you have any idea
how much that costs?

894
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,040
She does look good.

895
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,109
I'm serious.

896
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,777
I mean...

897
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,282
At first...
it was the dress,

898
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,652
then it was the cake, and
then the flower arrangements.

899
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:59,222
And now? She wants to have the
wedding at a five-star resort,

900
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,523
with fireworks.

901
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,692
She left out
the horse and carriage?

902
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,394
For now.

903
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:07,964
If I may offer some advice?

904
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,265
Please.

905
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,301
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

906
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,470
Know what, let's go grab a beer
and we'll talk about it.

907
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:17,474
Actually, there's a great spreadsheet
in my book you might find helpful.

908
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,676
Benny, you're
an absolute lifesaver.

909
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,153
Here he comes again.

910
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,023
Do you still think
he's not the competition?

911
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,391
I don't know what to think.

912
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,160
How can I like someone
so much personally,

913
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,095
but dislike them
so much professionally?

914
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,563
Try to be nice.

915
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,564
Okay.

916
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,899
And smile.

917
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:44,934
Hi, Ben.

918
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,836
Hey, Michelle.

919
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,171
Truce?

920
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:49,873
I didn't know we were fighting.

921
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,741
In that case, we're not.

922
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,778
Listen, this place is starting
to drive me a little crazy.

923
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,180
Can we get out of here?

924
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,147
Maybe go for a walk?

925
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,148
Actually...

926
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,350
She would love to.

927
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,818
She'd love to.

928
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,970
Thank you.

929
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,730
Now, I... know that we've
had some misunderstandings

930
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,965
over the past couple days.

931
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,734
My book is a bit controversial.

932
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,369
About that book,

933
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,838
I'm sorry, what makes
a financial planner

934
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,674
write a book called
"Wedding Do's and Don'ts?"

935
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,009
Like...?

936
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,343
You know what,
I'm going to get to that.

937
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,411
Okay.

938
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,379
But first, I want
to tell you a story

939
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,214
about someone
who's really close to me,

940
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,349
who got blindsided,
never saw it coming,

941
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,485
Let's call him...

942
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,986
Len.

943
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,321
Len?

944
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,924
Yeah, Len.

945
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:45,395
So, Len is madly in love
with this woman.

946
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,597
Let's call her Carolyn.

947
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,234
You know, all Len ever wanted
to do was to make Carolyn happy.

948
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,070
So, when she wanted
this uber-expensive,

949
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,072
impress-everyone wedding
with all the bells and whistles,

950
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,173
he agreed.

951
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:01,411
Now, this poor,
head-over-heels guy in love

952
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,845
spent a huge pile of dough

953
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,648
on the biggest wedding
you could ever imagine.

954
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,751
How does it end up for Len?

955
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,421
Not... not good. No.

956
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,089
They split up after a year.

957
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,925
Turns out that she was
more interested in the wedding

958
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,194
than in the marriage,

959
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,896
and Len was heartbroken.

960
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,098
Destroyed.

961
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,702
And to top it all off, flat broke,
and up to his ears in debt.

962
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,937
That's terrible.

963
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,892
I'm really sorry.
I had no idea.

964
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,442
It's not me.
Were you listening?

965
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,943
"Len".

966
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,712
You're not Len?

967
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,247
Why? Because "Len"
sounds a lot like "Ben"?

968
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,516
And because my ex-wife, Marilyn,

969
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,871
decided she didn't want
to be married after a year?

970
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,023
Okay, yeah, no,
you're right, it is me.

971
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,126
Yeah, laugh at my pain.

972
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,909
No, I-I'm not laughing at you,
I'm laughing with you.

973
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,298
I'm not laughing.

974
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,635
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm fine.

975
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,538
Yeah, I survived by not
leaving the house for a year,

976
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,641
and eating bad take-out food,

977
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,076
watching way too much
Sports Center,

978
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,379
and that's when I decided
to write the book.

979
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,180
Are you doing better now?

980
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,218
Much better...
now.

981
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:20,490
You know, if you think about it,
this is kind of like our first date.

982
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:25,228
I wouldn't really call this
a date, but if you say so.

983
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,463
I do.

984
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,412
I can't wait for
this convention to be over.

985
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,547
I can't believe
you're saying that.

986
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,639
Is it my imagination, or were we
just spinning our wheels today?

987
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:57,126
Well, today,
we sort of accomplished...

988
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,796
not as much as we could have.

989
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,598
Only a couple potential clients,
no new contracts.

990
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,667
Any good news?

991
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,171
Yes, we added
two new vendors to our roster,

992
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,190
Bodies by Bobby
and Elite Flowers,

993
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:12,175
which is the best florist
in the city.

994
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,176
Okay.

995
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,310
Yeah, that's...

996
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,282
What...
what's all this?

997
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,417
My faves.

998
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,485
Since when?

999
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,288
Since I was six.

1000
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,764
<i>All right, well,</i>

1001
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:35,498
<i>How's everybody doing
out there?</i>

1002
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,167
<i>Havin' a good time?</i>

1003
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:41,170
<i>Well, for those of you
who like Country and Western,</i>

1004
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,407
<i>won't you please give it up
for Mr. Wichita!</i>

1005
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,109
<i>Your Country DJ.</i>

1006
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,845
<i>He's perfect
for your upcoming ceremony.</i>

1007
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,781
<i>And now,
it's time to boot scoot!</i>

1008
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,855
You heard him, ladies,
time to boot scoot.

1009
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,575
I can't help it.

1010
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,678
I just, I keep seeing dollar signs
ringing in my eyeballs.

1011
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,915
It's like a cartoon,
"Ka-ching! Ka-ching! Ka-ching!"

1012
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,083
Why do we have to have
such a big wedding?

1013
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,386
Because
we only get to do this once.

1014
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,388
You heard what Libby said.

1015
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,992
Yeah, I did, but, sweetie,
we're not David and Samantha.

1016
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,593
They make way more money
than we do.

1017
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,629
But we can afford some things.

1018
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,863
Yeah, some things,

1019
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,532
but not Nena Lang dresses,

1020
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,867
and thousand-dollar
flower arrangements.

1021
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,907
And I Googled the Cake Kyng.

1022
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,441
He's got four dollar symbols.

1023
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,378
That's three more dollar symbols
than Adrays.

1024
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,780
We are not getting the cake
from a box store.

1025
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:03,019
This is our wedding,
not my 13th birthday.

1026
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,021
The cake is going to be
on display...

1027
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,390
Yeah, for, like, 10 minutes,

1028
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,724
and then it's gonna be
cut up and eaten.

1029
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,760
I can't believe
you just said that.

1030
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,934
I know you want
the perfect setting,

1031
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,936
and the perfect dress,
and the perfect everything,

1032
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,840
but we need to figure out a
budget, and we need to stick to it.

1033
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,641
I see what's happening here.

1034
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,577
You've been talking
with Ben again.

1035
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,578
Yeah.

1036
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,946
So?

1037
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,714
Do you really think
I'm going to plan my wedding

1038
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,382
based on the advice of
your cynical college roommate?

1039
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,086
Well, he makes
some valid points.

1040
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,562
Okay, you know what,
let's talk about this later.

1041
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:41,557
Come on, let's go dance.
You love this stuff.

1042
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,825
Come on.

1043
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,380
No thanks. I'm not
really in the mood.

1044
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,437
Brian, the party is great.

1045
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,338
Even better than last year.

1046
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,606
Thank you.

1047
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,607
My calf's a little sore,

1048
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,442
Libby only kicked me
three times.

1049
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,443
- It was twice.
- I think it was more...

1050
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,978
Hello.

1051
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,079
Listen, Brian,

1052
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:07,516
We've all been talking, and
we feel we need to do something

1053
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,684
about the "dump the event" guy.

1054
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,320
Look, I told you,
he's only here to sell his book.

1055
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:15,358
That's the problem,
his book is totally anti-event.

1056
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,659
We're all pro-event,

1057
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,729
and it's making it difficult
for us to "sell the event".

1058
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:20,463
Stop sugar-coating it,
Meredith.

1059
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,465
He's flat-out sabotaging us.

1060
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,501
I don't think
he's trying to sabotage us.

1061
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:26,402
Have you read his book?

1062
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,771
No, and we don't intend to.

1063
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,275
Well, it's a primer on how to get
married quick, dirty, and cheap.

1064
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:36,979
In a panel this morning, he said
my fondant was a "fon-don't".

1065
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,449
And, "Why hire a photographer
"when you can just use your iPhone

1066
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,417
and share photos
on the Internet?"

1067
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,452
Guys, is this really the time
and place to have this discussion?

1068
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:48,758
Every second that guy sticks around,
we lose more clients and money.

1069
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,226
Okay, please just listen
to me, everybody...

1070
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,527
Just relax, okay?

1071
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,497
Okay, now, I'm sorry
that you feel this way,

1072
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,967
but when Mr. Reynolds filled out
his application and paid his fee...

1073
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,669
Which is not cheap,
as you all know...

1074
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:03,239
Well, he earned his right to sell
his services, the same as any of you.

1075
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,974
Now, it's called competition.

1076
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,176
No, Brian, it's not competition

1077
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,178
when somebody is here
to destroy our businesses

1078
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,247
and ruin our livelihoods.

1079
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,241
Well, that's a bit much,
isn't it?

1080
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,618
Hey, guys!

1081
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,019
Great party.

1082
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,587
Here's to weddings.

1083
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,994
What was going on down there?

1084
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,330
Everybody left so quickly.

1085
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,065
They were probably tired.

1086
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,866
Party poopers.

1087
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,181
Yeah.

1088
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,603
Well...

1089
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,973
- Good night.
- Good night.

1090
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,258
Good night.

1091
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,160
Yeah.
Good night.

1092
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,605
I think you were
right about Ben.

1093
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,742
I mean, so what, we have
a few philosophical differences.

1094
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,810
He's a good guy.

1095
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,078
And a terrific dancer.

1096
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,079
Yeah.

1097
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,348
I mean, do you see how his whole
face lights up when he smiles?

1098
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,616
It's like...

1099
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,151
Told ya.

1100
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,386
I don't know 'Chelle,

1101
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,554
My heart just pulses
every time I see him.

1102
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,893
What?

1103
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,662
Tell me I am not seeing this.

1104
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,167
What? They're just
having breakfast.

1105
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,436
That is so much more
than breakfast!

1106
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,538
Libs, they're old friends,

1107
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,407
probably reliving glory days
over bacon and eggs.

1108
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,975
Don't be naive.

1109
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,077
That is Benedict Arnold
meeting with the British.

1110
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,113
Those are our clients,
and he's trying to steal them!

1111
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,015
Libby, no...

1112
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,884
Call it instinct,
call it intuition...

1113
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:55,851
Call it crazy.

1114
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,822
I'm a little worried that triple-shot
latte might be having ill affects.

1115
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,457
How about a decaf?

1116
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,391
You know what,
I'm going to walk in there,

1117
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,860
and I'm going to tell that Judas
exactly how I feel about him.

1118
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,329
Okay, you are overreacting.

1119
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,765
I mean, what exactly do you
think they're talking about?

1120
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,100
I don't know.

1121
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,069
By the time he's done with them,
they're going to be eloping.

1122
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,036
In Vegas.

1123
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,038
With Elvis.

1124
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,240
That's ridiculous.

1125
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,977
Come on, let's open the booth.

1126
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,679
Crazy lady...

1127
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,817
I'm not saying that
you should elope to Vegas

1128
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,019
and get married by Elvis,

1129
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,120
but I am saying

1130
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,922
that you shouldn't spend
all your money on one day.

1131
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,223
I mean, you're going to need
every penny of it

1132
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,217
for the down payment
on your house.

1133
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,661
And we were thinking
about getting a place, right?

1134
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,496
Yes, but...

1135
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,930
we'll have lots
of time to do that.

1136
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,669
But every month paying rent
is money not building equity.

1137
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:50,172
And you're missing tax benefits
and write-offs...

1138
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,208
What about our
family and friends?

1139
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,711
And I really liked the idea
of arriving in a carriage.

1140
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,713
What's more romantic
than butterflies?

1141
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,916
I know, sweetie, but the
wedding you're talking about

1142
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,319
costs... beaucoup dollars.

1143
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,675
Probably more than that.

1144
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,396
It's 3:30.

1145
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,397
They were supposed to
be here at 3:00.

1146
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,499
What did I tell you?

1147
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:17,933
So they're running late.

1148
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,902
What's the big deal?

1149
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,873
The big deal is that Ben
has stolen our clients!

1150
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,041
I'm gonna go find them.

1151
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,612
Suit yourself.

1152
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,718
Well, good day,
Weddings by Libby.

1153
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:36,886
Where are you hiding them?

1154
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Hiding who?

1155
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,555
Don't play dumb.

1156
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,524
I saw you having breakfast
with my clients.

1157
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,691
Alex and Annie?

1158
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,759
What, were you spying on me?

1159
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,227
Hardly.

1160
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,595
I just happened
to be walking by.

1161
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,632
I hope you're not filling their heads
with your ill-advised philosophy.

1162
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,834
Well, they
invited me to breakfast.

1163
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,948
Someone needs to speak
some common sense.

1164
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,738
I knew it.

1165
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,606
Knew what?

1166
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:01,477
Ben, I think you should know,
some people at the Expo

1167
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,779
are saying some
terrible things about you,

1168
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,013
and I'm starting to think
they might be right.

1169
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,895
Hey!

1170
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,597
So glad I ran into you guys.

1171
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,332
Did you forget about
our appointment?

1172
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,367
It's okay.

1173
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,302
Don't even worry about it.

1174
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,470
So over the last couple of days,
you've had a chance to look around

1175
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,172
get some information.

1176
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,876
We did.
We definitely did.

1177
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,946
Coming here has been
extremely eye-opening.

1178
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,847
Well, that's great.

1179
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,949
Hopefully, you had a chance

1180
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,750
to figure out what you like,
what you don't like.

1181
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,452
Yeah.

1182
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,388
All the information,
all the opinions,

1183
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,257
it really forced us
to start talking about...

1184
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,658
Fight about.

1185
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,993
Discuss.

1186
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,329
Guys, you know what,

1187
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,064
I know it can be
really stressful,

1188
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,333
so why don't we just start
with something easy.

1189
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,447
Are we still sticking to
a June wedding?

1190
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,305
We don't have to do June.

1191
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,673
Nothing's set.

1192
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,275
Why don't we look at
something later in the year?

1193
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,429
I love October weddings.

1194
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,112
It won't be in October.

1195
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,780
Okay, well, um,

1196
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,283
November's kind of getting
a little late in the season...

1197
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,757
We decided we don't
want a wedding at all.

1198
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,560
I'm sorry to hear that.

1199
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,529
Are you guys thinking
of a Justice of the Peace?

1200
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,732
Not exactly.

1201
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:35,170
Look, I'm not here to rush you guys,
so whenever you're ready,

1202
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,739
"Weddings by Libby"

1203
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,941
will be here to help you
with whatever you need.

1204
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,844
We're not getting
married at all.

1205
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,115
We're breaking up.

1206
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,451
You're breaking up?

1207
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:53,022
We realized
that we can't agree on anything.

1208
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:57,059
It's not just
the venue or the cake.

1209
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,193
It's everything.

1210
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:04,967
If we can't compromise
and make one day work,

1211
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,536
how can we make
a lifetime together work?

1212
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,447
We lost Alex and Annie.

1213
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:23,452
Not surprising, and probably
not a terrible thing.

1214
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,187
They had no idea
what they wanted.

1215
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,189
We would have been holding
their hand the whole time.

1216
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,726
Actually,
they split up altogether.

1217
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,099
That's awful...

1218
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,667
and so unexpected.

1219
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,404
They seemed so happy,
and in love, and cute together.

1220
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:46,008
Well, now they're unhappy,
split up, and not as cute.

1221
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,177
Man.

1222
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,412
Break-ups are the worst.

1223
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:55,984
You just want to curl up into a ball
and eat tuna casserole for days.

1224
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,087
Tuna casserole?

1225
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,589
We all have our own way
of mourning.

1226
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,991
I make tuna casserole.
Then I eat it.

1227
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,526
Don't judge me.

1228
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,428
Okay, you're right.

1229
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,997
Your tuna casserole
is my pineapple pizza.

1230
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,165
- Pineapple pizza?
- It's good.

1231
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:14,670
Give me a hand with this?

1232
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,321
Ready?

1233
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,777
My gosh, this is so heavy.

1234
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,178
I think it's stuck.

1235
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,747
Here, let me help you with that.

1236
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,081
Thanks.

1237
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,786
To the rescue again.

1238
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,623
You are unbelievable.

1239
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,925
I'm sure you heard what
happened to Alex and Annie.

1240
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,294
Yeah, I heard.

1241
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,797
If you would have just
stayed out of my business,

1242
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,132
none of this
would have happened,

1243
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,100
and they would still be planning
the wedding of their dreams.

1244
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,935
Okay, wait a minute.

1245
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,805
First off, they came to me,
asking for advice.

1246
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,740
You had them walking
down some primrose path

1247
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,342
to a wedding
they couldn't afford.

1248
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,811
Just because you had
a bad experience

1249
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,613
doesn't mean you should
ruin it for everyone else.

1250
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,648
And I suppose
your six-year-old's version

1251
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,983
of a pie-in-the-sky
fairy-tale wedding

1252
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,050
is something
you still believe in,

1253
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,218
no matter
what the circumstances.

1254
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,754
Well, for some people,
love is real

1255
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,370
and romance isn't dead,
so, no matter what you say...

1256
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,847
You know what, you're
never going to understand.

1257
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,564
So, just take your stupid book

1258
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,113
"Do" get out of my life
and "Don't" ever call me again.

1259
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,490
So...

1260
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,593
what's with the pineapple pizza?

1261
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,728
It's an acquired taste.

1262
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:47,763
Have a slice.

1263
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,897
I'll pass, I'll pass...

1264
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,767
So, we need to keep
the buzz going,

1265
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,037
and I propose
that we hit the road.

1266
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,473
Here's your itinerary.

1267
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,811
I thought you were talking about
a book tour.

1268
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,047
These are all bridal expos
and wedding conventions.

1269
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,682
Hey, that's our audience.

1270
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:07,916
Yeah, but at expos,

1271
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,585
I'm basically
pitching against vendors

1272
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,488
that are there promoting
weddings and their services.

1273
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:13,922
And once again, by the end,
I will be hated.

1274
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,924
You will be hated,

1275
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,693
but you will be
selling books, though.

1276
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
All the difference in the world.

1277
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,497
It's not gonna happen.

1278
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,451
I'm gonna do
another bridal expo.

1279
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,680
Boy.

1280
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,015
Did he send you that?

1281
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,184
No, I ordered it.

1282
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,652
You ordered it?

1283
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,920
So?

1284
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,956
There might be something
I can glean from it.

1285
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,926
Girlfriend,
you got it bad.

1286
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,209
What are you doing here?

1287
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,345
You're the last person
I expected to see.

1288
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,849
I've been thinking a lot
about Alex and Annie.

1289
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,518
They're really good together,
and they love each other.

1290
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,423
So you're not here to make up?

1291
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,727
Look,

1292
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,564
we can't pretend that we had
nothing to do with that break-up,

1293
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:29,798
so we need to do something.

1294
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,001
What do you want to do?
It's their lives, not ours.

1295
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,406
I don't know.
But something.

1296
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,948
Good one.

1297
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,318
That's past the 240 marker.

1298
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:53,034
Keep that up, you can give the
wedding game and go on the tour.

1299
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,657
Right.

1300
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,893
I should quit the wedding game.

1301
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,063
Listen, Alex, I want to
apologize for the role I played

1302
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,177
in your breakup with Annie.

1303
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,535
Forget it.

1304
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,737
No. No, I'm serious.
I love you guys,

1305
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,906
and that's the last thing
I wanted to see happen.

1306
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,675
It's, you know,
because we're friends,

1307
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,012
I got so caught up
in the financial aspects,

1308
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,815
that I forgot about the love.

1309
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,920
I'm the one
who asked you for help, so...

1310
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,088
it wasn't you, it was me.

1311
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,424
Well, I know that we talked a lot
about the expense of the Big Day,

1312
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:34,296
though we never talked about the
financial benefits of getting hitched.

1313
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,398
Like filing a joint tax return.

1314
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,799
And insurance is cheaper...

1315
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,234
Benny, Benny, stop.

1316
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:42,437
None of those are good reasons
to get married.

1317
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,906
I made my choice, and...

1318
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,341
now I gotta live with it.

1319
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,243
No. You don't.

1320
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:50,912
You can still make things right.

1321
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,080
You guys can work
this thing out.

1322
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,451
I don't know, I mean, she
doesn't even want to talk to me.

1323
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,187
I hope you're right,
because I'm lost without her.

1324
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,958
I know what you mean.

1325
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,427
The right woman is hard to find,

1326
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,095
and when you do,

1327
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,830
you better hold on tight.

1328
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:26,148
The front desk said
I'd find you out here.

1329
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,083
Thank you for taking
the time to meet with me.

1330
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,217
Do you want to sit?

1331
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:38,527
I was happy you called,
but surprised.

1332
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,362
Nothing's changed.

1333
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,831
We're not getting married.

1334
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,966
Well, that's why I'm here.

1335
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,301
I wanted to apologize.

1336
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,769
That's not necessary.

1337
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:48,804
Annie...

1338
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,939
I got so wrapped up

1339
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,441
in wanting to give you
the wedding of your dreams,

1340
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,944
I forgot about the practical,
the hard costs.

1341
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,714
That was not fair to do
to you or Alex.

1342
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,115
I'm so sorry.

1343
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:04,252
I was the one
who wanted the big wedding.

1344
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,121
That's all I cared about.

1345
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:10,711
Forget about the wedding,
just think about Alex the person.

1346
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,929
You two were so good together.

1347
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,031
I know.

1348
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,133
We were.

1349
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,669
Well, you can make it right,
and you should.

1350
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,739
I was so mad.

1351
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,973
I said some terrible things.

1352
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,975
That doesn't even matter.

1353
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,143
You two love each other.

1354
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,080
I just...

1355
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,782
I wish we could start over.

1356
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,419
I wish that, too.

1357
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:14,723
Annie?

1358
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,091
What?

1359
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,327
It's so good
to see you guys together.

1360
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,362
I was not expecting this.

1361
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,731
How are you?
What's going on?

1362
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,366
Well...

1363
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,438
What's he doing here?

1364
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:06,708
What's going on?

1365
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:09,062
Why don't you guys
sit down? We'll explain.

1366
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,514
We have some news
we want to share.

1367
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,316
I hope this is about
what I think it is.

1368
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,519
We're back together.

1369
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,020
- That is great news.
- That's amazing.

1370
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,456
And we're getting married.

1371
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,525
- Congratulations!
- That's fantastic.

1372
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,328
This is really the best news.

1373
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,811
And we want the two of you
to help us plan our wedding.

1374
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,301
- I can't work with her.
- I can't work with him.

1375
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,438
But I can't get married
without your help.

1376
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,473
And I can't get married
without you.

1377
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,541
Thank you...

1378
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,809
This is a quandary.

1379
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,403
It's more of a conundrum.

1380
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,647
Well, you don't want us
to break up again, do you?

1381
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:46,781
No!

1382
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,084
Then it's settled.

1383
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,752
When can we get started?

1384
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,923
All right, come on, people,
we're a team.

1385
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,492
Everybody, group hug, people!

1386
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,194
Okay, maybe not.

1387
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:07,602
Isn't this exiting?

1388
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,671
We have our Dream Team here.

1389
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:12,774
So, if we're going to have a June
wedding, we'd better get going.

1390
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,042
Libby?

1391
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,444
No, I'm going to let Ben
lead this one.

1392
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,247
No, no, you go ahead.

1393
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,362
No, please, I insist.

1394
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,317
You're the wedding planner.

1395
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,852
You should lead the charge.

1396
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:24,853
All right, all right,
I'll start.

1397
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:27,055
Annie and I were thinking

1398
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,556
that Calamigos would be
a good venue for us.

1399
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,125
Yes. It's very romantic.

1400
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,726
I think that's perfect.

1401
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,228
It's a great idea

1402
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,396
if you want to get married
in your street clothes,

1403
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,531
because you're not going to be
able to afford a wedding dress.

1404
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:37,666
That place is so expensive.

1405
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,167
Are you sure?

1406
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,870
I'm sure. Yes.

1407
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,605
How about the beach
at Los Oros, at sunset?

1408
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:44,706
Well, clearly, you need
to get out more,

1409
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,474
because Los Oros
is infested with flies.

1410
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,643
They bite.
It's a terrible idea.

1411
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,645
Biting flies.

1412
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,181
Okay, Los Oros
is definitely out.

1413
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,151
How about
the Westbrook Country Club?

1414
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,153
They book a year in advance, but
sometimes, they have cancellations.

1415
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:01,656
Please, that is your typical,
been-there, done-that venue.

1416
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,558
Don't you want to give them
the wedding of their dreams?

1417
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,962
Yeah, but you want to scrape two
nickels together to pay for it.

1418
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,396
Just something
affordable, Libby.

1419
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,699
Well, I hope you don't suggest a
drive-thru in Vegas.

1420
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,509
- Would anyone like a coffee?
- No.

1421
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,438
Finally, an agreement.

1422
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,807
I'm starting to think
this was a bad idea.

1423
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,275
Yeah, I mean, maybe
we should just elope.

1424
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,276
- No.
- No.

1425
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:27,849
Guys, I know old habits
are hard to break,

1426
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,652
but can't you two
please try to get along?

1427
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,454
For the sake of our wedding day?

1428
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,726
Libby, don't I
remember you saying

1429
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,127
that each wedding
should be unique,

1430
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,597
and you try and tailor the
ceremony to each individual couple?

1431
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,433
I did.

1432
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,868
All right, well,
I happen to know

1433
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:48,937
that these two had
their first date on a...

1434
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,891
Harbor Cruise.

1435
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,074
A boat could be a perfect idea.

1436
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,142
And it just so happens

1437
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,144
that one of my clients
owns one of the boats,

1438
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,180
and I'd be able to negotiate
a fair and affordable price.

1439
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,415
I love that idea.

1440
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,182
Yeah, yeah, me too.

1441
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,952
Now, I know this really
isn't my department,

1442
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,066
but I think it would be
really romantic.

1443
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,190
I guess we're all
going to the harbor.

1444
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,828
Ships ahoy, all hands on deck.

1445
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,501
You know, I haven't
been here in so long.

1446
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,775
I forgot how beautiful
this place is.

1447
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,004
And budget friendly.

1448
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,406
I am so rubbing off on you.

1449
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,874
We'll see.

1450
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,575
Okay, so we need a dance floor.

1451
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,312
A place to put the tables
and chairs, a place for the DJ,

1452
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,515
and somewhere to serve the food.

1453
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,183
You know, if I was
the wedding planner...

1454
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,818
But you're not.

1455
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,219
Right. I forgot.

1456
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:39,487
All I do is crunch numbers.

1457
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,321
Crunch, crunch, crunch,
crunch, crunch.

1458
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,323
There we go.

1459
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:43,992
But if I was a wedding planner,

1460
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:47,996
I might consider having the
ceremony on the roof deck.

1461
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,433
And we could seal the wedding
with a kiss right at sunset.

1462
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,668
What an amazing photo
that would be.

1463
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:56,471
And we could just do the reception
on one of the lower decks.

1464
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:59,240
Which means that we could save
the roof deck for the first dance,

1465
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,242
With the mountains behind them?

1466
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,143
And there's plenty of
room on the middle deck

1467
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,079
for the tables and chairs.

1468
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,614
You missed your calling,
"Book By Ben".

1469
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,051
Thank you very much,
"Weddings by Libby".

1470
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,221
This is going to be a huge amount
of work in not a lot of time.

1471
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,175
Are you sure you're up for this?

1472
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,094
As ready as a man can be.

1473
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,528
Okay.

1474
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:27,569
Okay, do you want
to go over menus?

1475
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,803
Perfect.

1476
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,939
So, this is Leone's catering

1477
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:33,908
It's Italian, it's a little
pricey, but really reliable.

1478
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,643
RT's Catering.

1479
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,678
Here, do you want to look?

1480
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:43,051
Big variety, it's buffet style so
it's a little bit more affordable.

1481
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,620
And this, most would say
was the best,

1482
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,721
Silverman's Catering.

1483
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:49,124
They're known for their
prime rib and lobster.

1484
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,726
The prime rib looks delicious,
and I love lobster.

1485
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,663
Libby, we might want to consider
more modest menu options

1486
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,600
and instead put the money back
into Annie's wedding dress.

1487
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,834
Okay, well, what do you suggest?

1488
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,002
We have to feed 150 people.

1489
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,705
Please don't mention 150 people.

1490
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,573
It makes me nervous.

1491
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,841
Why, honey?

1492
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,544
Just all those people
watching me say "I do".

1493
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,147
Sweetie,
that's so cute.

1494
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:16,017
My gosh,
that's really good.

1495
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,652
I had no idea.

1496
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,187
Alex and I love food trucks.

1497
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,690
Yeah, Wok and Roll,
Thrilled Cheese.

1498
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:23,958
Don't forget 50 Shades of Filet.

1499
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,929
And my personal favorite,
Tapas the Morning to you.

1500
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,698
And the best barbecue places
is Indiana Bones.

1501
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,447
Wait, why don't we just have
a food truck cater the wedding?

1502
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,638
A food truck?

1503
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,639
For a wedding?

1504
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,640
It's affordable.

1505
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,442
Okay, I like
the way you're thinking.

1506
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:42,544
Thank you.

1507
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,945
And you guys could have
the reception

1508
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,914
out in the harbor,
then you could come back here,

1509
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,049
your guests could go to the
food truck, get their food,

1510
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,684
get back on the boat
to dine and dance.

1511
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,085
Yeah, that could be great.

1512
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,387
What do you guys think?

1513
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,655
I love it.

1514
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,656
Yeah, me too.

1515
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,650
Glad I'm on board
for this cruise.

1516
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,427
I would hope so.

1517
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,863
You should try this one as well,

1518
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,765
It's stunning.

1519
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,368
And how is
everything going over here?

1520
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,705
Well, we're still looking.

1521
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,640
See anything you like?

1522
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:13,608
They're all beautiful...

1523
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,609
I think you liked this one.

1524
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,444
The lace was nice.

1525
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,712
Now, ladies...

1526
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,715
You know I loathe
being the bearer of bad news,

1527
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,684
but have you seen these prices?

1528
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,686
We can't afford these dresses.

1529
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,421
I think our best option
is to rent a dress.

1530
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,856
Chapter 5.
"Don't Drown in the Gown".

1531
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,725
So you did read my book.

1532
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:31,759
Would you like it back?

1533
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,895
Yeah, so I can hit you with it.

1534
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:35,263
Ooh, ouch, not again.

1535
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:39,667
I'm sorry,
but I really don't want to rent.

1536
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,236
I want to have this dress
forever.

1537
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,303
Of course.

1538
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:46,908
In that case, maybe we
should look over here.

1539
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,477
Here are my most
affordable dresses,

1540
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:53,348
and truthfully, most of them
are perfectly lovely.

1541
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,682
What about this one?

1542
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,418
It has a classic open back.

1543
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,320
I don't think so.

1544
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,256
This is very popular.

1545
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:05,560
This is a knock-off of Verdiggio's
Mediterranean line, El Greco.

1546
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,962
I just don't think it suits me.

1547
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,734
Hold on, the dress that
Annie modeled at the expo,

1548
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,035
is that still in the shop?

1549
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,370
Yes.

1550
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,804
And modeling it at the expo,

1551
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,959
wouldn't that have
turned it into a sample?

1552
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,242
Well, yes, it would.

1553
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,278
And what kind of a the discount
do you offer on samples?

1554
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:27,148
Well, usually, 35 to 40%.

1555
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,783
All right, well,
let's call it half price,

1556
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:29,651
and we'll throw in
photos from the wedding

1557
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,852
that you can use for marketing.

1558
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,288
You know Libby's photographer
is excellent.

1559
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,804
I think we can all agree Annie
looked stunning in that dress.

1560
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,627
And she is your client...

1561
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,131
Sold!

1562
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,632
Thank you so much.

1563
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,501
Thank you.

1564
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:47,602
You're welcome.

1565
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,605
I love you for that.

1566
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,940
And I think the dress
is right over here.

1567
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,496
I think I love you
for that, too.

1568
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:02,116
Okay, time to learn
your wedding dance.

1569
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,051
Stand straight.

1570
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,152
Your shoulders back.

1571
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:05,153
Good.

1572
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,354
Nice firm arm.

1573
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,923
Now, you can't think.

1574
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,425
Just do.

1575
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,759
Just let your body do it.

1576
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,127
Thinking will only
get in your way.

1577
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:13,895
Let me show you what I mean.

1578
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:14,929
Libby?

1579
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,265
Thank you.

1580
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,821
Now, Alex, you have to be
a nice strong lead.

1581
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,438
Just...

1582
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:25,440
concentrate on
your partner's beautiful eyes

1583
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,710
and feel the music...

1584
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,147
...and everything else
will take care of itself.

1585
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,800
Okay, Alex, give it a shot.

1586
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,236
Okay.

1587
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,246
Yeah, this is gonna be trouble.

1588
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,720
Alex was always
a terrible dancer.

1589
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,084
Well, at least he has
a few days to learn.

1590
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,446
Yeah, he's going to need
every minute of it.

1591
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:17,765
Have I ever told you my motto?

1592
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,561
You have a motto?

1593
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,662
Of course.

1594
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,231
And your motto is?

1595
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:25,265
"Never let a good song
go to waste".

1596
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,970
Would you like
to dance with me again?

1597
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,806
Did I ever tell you my motto?

1598
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,207
I'm listening.

1599
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,676
"Never refuse
a beautiful woman".

1600
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:41,349
And I promise
I won't step on your toes.

1601
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,184
I'll forgive you if you do.

1602
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,129
Okay, so, this is where
your reception will be,

1603
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,231
with the dance floor
right in the middle.

1604
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,802
We'll be doing the cutting
of the cake on the bow,

1605
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,236
and you'll say your "I do's"
on the upper deck upstairs.

1606
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,074
Isn't it perfect, honey?

1607
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,876
Yeah.
Yeah I-I just,

1608
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,812
I didn't expect it to be...

1609
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,848
so, so big.

1610
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,984
And this is where
we'll have the Big Show.

1611
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,186
Show?

1612
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,187
Let me give you a little visual

1613
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,701
so you know what
I'm talking about.

1614
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,724
Okay.

1615
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,960
We're going to place 12 of
these monitors around the room,

1616
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:27,762
surrounding you and your guests.

1617
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,798
They will see a montage
of your lives.

1618
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,703
This will all be edited together
with a beautiful piece of music,

1619
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:39,874
and the whole experience will say
"This marriage was meant to be".

1620
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,477
That's a great idea.
That's what I call romantic.

1621
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,880
Does the show have to
be about us?

1622
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,715
Couldn't it be about,
you know, somebody else?

1623
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,885
You.
He has to joke about everything.

1624
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,359
No, I'm...
I'm serious.

1625
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,224
Is there a bathroom on the boat?

1626
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:58,526
Yeah, it's back there.

1627
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:03,731
Is he going to be okay?

1628
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:06,968
Actually, I'm not sure.

1629
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,522
I think he might be
having some jitters.

1630
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:11,239
But I'm sure he'll be fine.

1631
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,474
Try not to worry about it.

1632
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,910
Excuse me.

1633
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,585
I gotta to tell you, Libby,

1634
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,722
it's been a real treat for me,
seeing you put this thing together,

1635
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:31,158
and this is the icing
on the cake, Really.

1636
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,161
This is going to be
a very special wedding.

1637
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,863
You should be proud of yourself.

1638
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,198
I'm proud of us.

1639
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,734
Thank you for helping.

1640
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,836
I couldn't have gotten
this far without you.

1641
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,873
I guess we make
a pretty good team, then.

1642
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:48,643
Maybe this is the start
of something special.

1643
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:50,978
Maybe.

1644
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,814
Would you like it to be?

1645
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,818
Good night, Ben Reynolds.

1646
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,255
Good night, Libby Boland.

1647
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,635
<i>"Dear Libby and Ben,</i>

1648
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,537

01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,177

1653
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:59,847
Libby, what's wrong?

1654
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:05,620

1664
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,540
Can you believe he did this?

1665
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,609
Poor guy.

1666
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,946
Poor guy?

1667
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,447
What are you talking about?

1668
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,751
I feel for him,
he must be scared.

1669
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,019
To walk away
from his own wedding?

1670
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,955
He must be terrified.

1671
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,289
What?

1672
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,693
I'm on the hook for everything.

1673
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,329
The venue, the catering,
the dress, the cake.

1674
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:49,930
You don't have anything in this.

1675
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,699
I'm done.

1676
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,701
You can sue him.

1677
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,672
Well, unfortunately,
he's one of your best friends,

1678
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,040
so I'm not going to sue him.

1679
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,345
Besides, you know what that
would do to my reputation?

1680
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,647
My business is ruined.

1681
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,316
Come on... don't-don't cry.

1682
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,284
We'll figure something out.

1683
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:14,522
Everything I've worked for...

1684
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,794
Look at me.

1685
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,997
Do you trust me?

1686
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,835
Then you believe me
when I tell you

1687
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,137
that I am not going to
let that happen.

1688
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,115
Okay, 'Chelle? Hey.

1689
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,650
Will you make sure
the champagne is on ice?

1690
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:43,984
Yeah, and check
the place cards,

1691
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,653
make sure they've been
alphabetized.

1692
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:47,788
<i>Already done, boss lady.</i>

1693
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,291
Also, I want to see
the bride's bouquet.

1694
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,226
<i>On the way.</i>

1695
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,360
Great.

1696
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,031
Remember to cue the bride

1697
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,800
with the first four bars
of Canon in D Major.

1698
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:00,735
Thank you.

1699
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,372
Vinny,

1700
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,908
make sure the bride is backlit
as much as possible.

1701
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,244
We want her looking her best
on her special day.

1702
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,812
I got you covered.

1703
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,515
And rest assured, I'll use
nothing but long lenses.

1704
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,517
You're the best.

1705
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,724
So, I was feeling
especially generous today,

1706
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,427
so I added a couple
of extra tiers, no charge.

1707
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:27,561
You are so sweet.

1708
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:29,764
"Sweet" is my middle name.

1709
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,432
So it is.

1710
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,200
Are you going to be here
for the cutting of the cake?

1711
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:34,668
I wouldn't miss it.

1712
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,837
I can't wait to see your face
when you see the filling.

1713
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:38,839
That's because the proof
is in the pudding,

1714
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,241
and the pudding...

1715
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,542
...Is in the cake"!

1716
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,944
Libs...

1717
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,079
Bride's bouquet.

1718
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,615
Are you kidding me?
I wanted tulips, not roses.

1719
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:49,517
And what's with the lilies?

1720
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,252
That's what you ordered. I...

1721
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,387
I'm just kidding.
It's beautiful.

1722
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,690
The guests are
starting to show up.

1723
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,758
Can you actually
stall them

1724
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,426
with a little bubbly
before they get on board.

1725
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,594
Got it.

1726
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,896
Have you seen Ben?

1727
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:05,800
He said something about
the groom having jitters.

1728
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:06,967
Haven't seen him since.

1729
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,036
Is it a Code Blue?
Do I need to talk to him?

1730
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,671
I don't think so, Libs.

1731
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:11,972
If I know Ben,
I'm sure he'll handle it.

1732
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,707
You're probably right.

1733
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,212
'Chelle, I could really learn
to love that guy.

1734
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:19,547
Well, he is pretty lovable.

1735
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,515
Who knew?

1736
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,351
Okay, I better go
take care of the bride.

1737
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,387
Hey, Libs...

1738
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,655
Be gentle with her,

1739
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:28,689
we don't need
a bridezilla today.

1740
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,725
Roger that.

1741
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,706
Did I fix it?

1742
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:53,941
You did.

1743
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,509
Do you trust me now?

1744
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:56,911
I do.

1745
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:59,046
Do you promise
to love me forever?

1746
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,748
I do.

1747
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,952
Okay, okay, you guys,
save it for later.

1748
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:06,420
Hold the kisses.

1749
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,730
My apologies,
I've got to take this.

1750
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,699
Alex?

1751
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,535
Yeah, I,
I can't really talk right now.

1752
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,138
Pardon?

1753
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,475
That's great, man.

1754
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,344
Enjoy Fiji,

1755
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:31,478
should make for
a great honeymoon.

1756
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,714
Okay.

1757
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,916
Sounds like Alex and Annie
got the wedding of their dreams.

1758
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,685
Well, so did we.

1759
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,423
Dear friends,
we are gathered here today

1760
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,693
to celebrate
this very special love

1761
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:49,263
between Elizabeth Boland
and Benjamin Reynolds

1762
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:52,433
and joining them
in holy matrimony...
