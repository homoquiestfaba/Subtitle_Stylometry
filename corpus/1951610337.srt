00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,322
(wind whistling)

2
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,325
(tires screech)

3
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,521
(horn blares continuously)

4
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,300
(countny music plays
in distance)

5
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,793
(laughing)

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,101
- Asshole!
- Look out, Bozo!

7
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,178
(laughing)

8
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,029
Hey. Hey. Hey!

9
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,262
What?!

10
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,612
Shut up, fag.

11
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,583
(music plays)

12
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,884
The friggin' maids took my laptop.
I'm talkin' about evenytlhing.

13
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,323
I've got fourteen quality leads
waiting for me in that area.

14
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,316
Yeah.

15
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,829
No. They're with Packard, bro.

16
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,331
Hewlett-Pack...

17
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,771
Wake up!

18
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,674
Ohh! Just get outta here.

19
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,645
Hey, uh, how much
for the whole night, Grandma?

20
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,973
You should be so lucky.

21
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,611
- Oooh... hot for teacher.
- Oh, you little...

22
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,984
God damn.

23
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,829
Dude you're late.
I have to leave in a half hour.

24
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,930
Don't dilly-dally, then.
Rack 'em.

25
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:32,535
Dilly-dally. I'll just dilly-dally over
and grab that money from you.

26
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,698
(clatter)

27
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,926
Damn!

28
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,532
I mean, we've been
going out for years,

29
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,540
and all of a sudden... bang... she drops me.

30
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,681
No, I'm not saying I ever lhad it,
but I've definitely lost it.

31
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,819
I mean, I used to be a model.

32
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,515
J.C. Penney. Springwear.

33
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,684
Yeah. See? See, look.

34
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,988
Look. See?

35
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,820
- That was one of my model things.
- Oh. Yeah.

36
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,263
It might not look like it now...

37
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,268
that's 'cause I'm wearing work clothes,
so it doesn't really fit, you know,

38
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,033
but if I was wearing my modeling clothes,
trust me, I'd look like a model.

39
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,506
Yeah, yeah, you're full of shit.

40
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,008
COACH:
You know, Chach...

41
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,070
I take the rubble of man...

42
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,638
and I build superstars.

43
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,514
Come on, man.
Fuck that shit.

44
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,253
I don't want no brochures
in here, man.

45
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,356
I mean, this guy,
he gets an open tab all the time here.

46
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,627
Watch. Watch. Watch.

47
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,637
Amen, Brother Ben.
Shot a rooster, killed a hen.

48
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,607
Now, that's Hollywood talk.
That's showbiz, brother.

49
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,405
If you change your mind.

50
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,771
BARTENDER: If you're gonna
hang around a while, that's great.

51
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,148
- But you gotta move your truck.
- Yeah. No, I hear ya.

52
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,083
- But you gotta move your truck.
- Yeah. No, I hear ya.

53
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,618
I keep forgettin'.

54
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,020
This place is hoppin'.

55
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,789
Oh, no. Listen, your money
can't buy shit here, Sergeant.

56
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,059
- Well, thank you.
- Semper fi, man.

57
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,532

58
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,068
- Yeah?

00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,865
kiss my wife,

60
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,270
be back on the front lines
as soon as they'll have me.

61
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,106
- That's truly righteous, man.
- You don't know my wife.

62
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,202
(Bartender laughs)

63
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,883
Ohh.

64
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,665
- Evenin'.

65
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,705
Oh, I was... I was, uh...
I was just lookin' for ya.

66
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,035
Zip it, shitbox.

67
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,200
You dropped off the beer.
Now take a hike.

68
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,267
Okay.
- Now! Now!

69
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,504
Ohh, man.

70
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,623
(chokes)
Goddamn dirt weed.

71
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,681
(coughing)

72
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,036
Rum and Coke...
without the Coke.

73
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,974
Keep it.

74
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,673
Not from around here, are ya?

75
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,445
- What gave me away?
- You have all your teeth.

76
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,288
Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,263
I'm off in five.

78
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,567
Whisky shooter, please.

79
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,510
BARTENDER:
Which tab?

80
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,695
Mine.

81
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,062
- Hey, watch it there, buddy.
- Jeez, dude, I'm playing a game.

82
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,964
- Well, so am I.
- Yeah, mine's for real money, though.

83
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,865
That's all she wrote.

84
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,133
What the fuck!

85
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,641
Oh!

86
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,772
- That's a rough one.
- That is fucking impossible!

87
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,612
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
Want to go again?

88
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,742
- Goddamnit, no!
- Come on.

89
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,944
"Crap-ay" diem!

90
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,620
Fuckin' pussy.

91
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,122
Anybody wanna go?

92
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,286
(panting)

93
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,056
Mom, when are we going home?

94
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,592
After my meeting.

95
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,332
BOSSMAN:
Come on. Baby. Let's nock and noll.

96
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,940
Okay. You know the drill.

97
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,775
Keep these on.

98
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,837
Come on.
I can't do tlhis by myself. Lhoney.

99
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,007
Now!

100
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,558
BARTENDER:
Come on. Take you to your car.

101
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,530
Not tonight.
I have an escort.

102
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,603
Eighteen bucks, pal.

103
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,678
I guess I'll hold on to this.

104
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,557
Ah! Ah, shit!

105
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,103
Shit! Slhit!

106
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,944
(Bossman whooping and laughing)

107
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,708
Ohh! Olhlh!

108
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,012
Damn, baby, act like you feel it!

109
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,449
Ahh!

110
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,622
(Bossman laughs)

111
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,649
Shit fine!

112
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,768
Hey, uh, you boys want to
try your luck with the loot?

113
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,804
Come on.

114
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,610
Hey, I'll use one arm.

115
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,720
Nothing but a bunch of
limp dicks and pussies in here!

116
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,347
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

117
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,722
You shut the fuck up,
or get out.

118
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,454
No, you shut up, old man.

119
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,793
Come on!

120
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,263
Gimme some action!

121
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,529
The fuck are you?

122
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,812
Unless you people want to die,

123
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,905
you'll do what I say
and you'll do it fast.

124
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,875
Mine's bigger'n yours.

125
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,551
Listen to me.

126
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,586
A storm of hell's comin' down
on this place any second.

127
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,730
I don't know what they are...

128
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,034
I don't know where they came from.

129
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:21,301
All I do know is that these fuckers
are fast, nasty, and hungry.

130
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,705
And there's four of 'em.

131
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:28,042
They got claws like Ginsu knives
and more teeth than a chainsaw.

132
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,945
They're comin'.
Right now.

133
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,083
So we gotta lock this bar down.

134
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,589
That means doors, windows,
drains, and zippers,

135
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,492
and we gotta do it fast.

136
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,294
You. Get a phone, call the cops,
National Guard, townies...

137
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,961
anybody who kicks ass...
and get 'em out here.

138
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,733
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

139
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,505
Who the hell are you?

140
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,747
I'm the guy
that's gonna save your ass.

141
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:10,911
Fuck.

142
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,355
(creature growling)

143
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,123
Aah!!!

144
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,567
Aah!

145
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,032
Aah!

146
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,101
Get down!

147
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,144
Where is he?
Where's my husband?

148
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,713
(creature growling)

149
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,848
Cody?

150
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,349
Come here.

151
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,293
I want you to stay...

152
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,694
right here.

153
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,756
I want you to stay in this closet
and do not move.

154
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,200
I don't care what you hear,
don't move!

155
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,698
(Honey Pie gasping hysterically)

156
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,574
(creature growling)

157
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,629
(creature shrieking)

158
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,831
Help me, somebody.

159
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,131
(creature growling)

160
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,342
Aah! Aah!

161
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,286
Aaahh! Aaahh!

162
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,662
(gunshots)

163
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,533
Aah!

164
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,011
(Harley Mom screaming)

165
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,495
Is it gone?

166
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,464
What the fuck?!

167
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,762
Fuck! Fuck!

168
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,631
Fuckin'...!

169
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,471
(sobbing)

170
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,640
Where's that little fucker?

171
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,858
(creature screeching)

172
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,426
I got it! I got it!

173
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,725
We're okay.

174
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:14,239
(creature growling)

175
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,605
- Scratch that.
- Close the motherfucking shutters!

176
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,188
God damn you!

177
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,265
Beer me.

178
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,578
- Is it clear?
- Unh! What the fuck?

179
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,981
Is it clear down there?

180
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,452
Yeah, I-I think...
I-I don't know.

181
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,250
I don't know, boss.

182
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,222
Is there a gun pointed at you?

183
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,555
No. No, I got...
I got the judge, see?

184
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,825
All right, nobody
moves down there. Nobody!

185
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,263
Shit.

186
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,832
BOSSMAN:
All right, goddamnit! Who shot me?

187
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,437
Oww! Fuck!
Who did it?!

188
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,578
What are you idiots looking at?
My goddamn foot's blown off here!

189
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,813
Who shot me?

190
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,945
Her fella.

191
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,250
My husband.

192
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,691
Where is the son of a bitch?

193
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,254
He's dead.

194
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,318
What?

195
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,393
What the fuck happened down here?

196
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,665
What? What?

197
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,727
Look, it wasn't me, all right?

198
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,967
It was a f-fucking monster
or something!

199
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,171
I-I didn't do nothin'.

200
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,575
One of their heads is over here.

201
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,277
Ow!

202
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,454
Yeah, that's...

203
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,922
that's definitely one for the wall.

204
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,755
Oh, my God.
What is that thing?

205
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,590
I have no...
I don't know.

206
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,460
I don't even know how I got here.
They were so fast.

207
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:58,526
That head used to be attached
to some huge, twisted body

208
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,870
like a rotting jackal or something,
like something out of a nightmare.

209
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,136
Of all the bars to be stuck in.

210
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,541
Anything else?

211
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,638
Yeah. We need to lock
this place down completely.

212
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,546
- Is everybody downstairs?
- My son...

213
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,244
- My son's upstairs!
- Wait! Stop her!

214
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,307
Cody!

215
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,146
Cody!

216
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,211
Cody?

217
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,723
(sobbing)

218
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,889
- Oh, God, no!
- Mommy?

219
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:28,296
Cody! I am never gonna
let you be alone again.

220
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,062
All right, look,
we gotta lock this place up.

221
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,727
Look, come here.
You okay?

222
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,169
Yeah?
I'm so sorry.

223
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,831
I am never gonna let you...

224
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,948
Aaaah!

225
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,957
Aah! Get it off me!

226
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,262
Aah! God!

227
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,971
TUFFY: No!!!

228
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,342
No!

229
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,644
No!!!

230
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,980
(sobbing) No!

231
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,452
No!

232
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,287
(coughing and retching)

233
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:30,192
TUFFY:
(sobbing) No! No!

234
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,222
No!

235
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,213
(Beer Guy coughing and retching)

236
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,487
Fuck! Aw!

237
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,822
BOSSMAN: Aw, God!

238
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,063
Somebody help me, man!

239
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,860
God damn! Ow!

240
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,128
Burnin', man! Shit!

241
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,136
Get this shit off me, man!

242
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,193
- Come on in...
- Fuck!

243
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,035
Come on, I got a sink in here.
Come on.

244
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,574
- Come on.
- Where'd he go, man?

245
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,668
All right. Ohh!

246
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,009
(coughing and retching)

247
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,776
BEER GUY: God! Aah!

248
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,017
(sobbing)

249
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,222
Was that the only phone?

250
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,352
BARTENDER:
Yep.

251
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,759
What about cell phones?

252
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,627
This is canyon country, honey.
It ain't gonna happen.

253
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,066
Well, we've got to
have sometlhing here, right?

254
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,128
Just relax.
I've got a shortwave radio.

255
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,868
Except it's...

256
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,966
upstairs there, somewhere.

257
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,475
This is bullshit.

258
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,279
What did you say to me?

259
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,886
I didn't say anything, Flo.

260
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,251
(Beer Guy coughing and retching)

261
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,024
BARTENDER: How you doin', buddy?
You holdin' up?

262
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,084
Bad! I'm doin' bad!

263
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,493
- Fuck!
- It's green.

264
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,053
Yeah, I know!

265
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,689
You got any more water pressure?

266
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,734
- No, that's all it's got.
- Aw, fuck!

267
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,793
God, your sink sucks!

268
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,005
Oh, fu... oww!
The stuff's up my nose, man!

269
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,512
Can you... can you feel it?

270
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,780
Just calm down, you goddamn pussy.
You're all right.

271
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,183
I gotta go to the hospital, man.
I gotta fuckin' leave, man.

272
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,155
I need a doctor, man.
I'm outta here.

273
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,715
I'm goin' to the hospital.
I'm gettin' my truck. I'm goin'.

274
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,920
- Just calm down, okay?
- No, you calm down.

275
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,036
Now, you can risk your life,
but not mine.

276
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,337
My daughter is out there
waiting for me.

277
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,900
I have just as much reason
to get out of this place as you do.

278
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,912
But I also have
the common fuckin' sense to know

279
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,778
that staying alive means
being in here and not out there.

280
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,943
Do you understand?

281
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,383
Do you understand me?!

282
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,286
Yeah... yeah. Got... got ya. Got ya.

283
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,119
Pull that tough-guy shit again,

284
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,024
I will slice you from your neck
to your nuts.

285
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,619
This is bullshit, man.
You can't keep me here.

286
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,393
You fuckers can't keep me here, man!
This is bullshit.

287
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,593
This is fuckin' bullshit!

288
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,499
This is bullshit, man!

289
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,231
Fuck this.

290
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,467
...this shit off of me myself!

291
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,997
Act like you've had some.

292
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,072
- Oh, I've had some, baby.
- I haven't.

293
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,840
Oh, God.

294
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,410
That's gonna stain.

295
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,191
We can't risk letting them in.

296
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,202
Have they left? It's quiet.

297
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,171
HOT WHEELS:
No, they're still out there.

298
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,901
They're just listening to us.

299
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,705
We gotta start
clearin' these bodies up.

300
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,617
Jesus Christ.

301
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,594
Oh, shit! Fuck!

302
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,756
- Come on! Come on!
- Easy, bud.

303
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,699
It's just a death rattle.

304
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,794
He's gone, he just ain't done
movin' yet.

305
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,899
Let's wrap 'em up in tablecloths
and dump 'em in the basement.

306
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,168
All right?

307
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,508
- All right?
- All right.

308
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,280
Let's lock this place down.

It's gonna eat us!

We have to kill this thing.

it took all that?

- All those bullets?
- That's the little one?!

340
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,099
We can't kill these things!
No way!

341
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,041
Look, we lhave to fight these things.

342
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,444
We just have to be clever
about this, okay?

343
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,312
Maybe we don't need to
fight them at all.

344
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,943
Yeah. Why don't we
just call them names?

345
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,316
Fuckin' genius.

346
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,721
We're stuck here...
I can see this.

347
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:25,957
But what we need to do
is think outside the box.

348
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,329
We don't need to fight them.
We need to scane them.

349
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,834
We need to scare them back.

350
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,098
This...

351
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,041
...is a species stand-off.

352
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,307
We just need to show them
that we are not vulnerable.

353
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,508
That we... are fonmidable.

354
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,913
How?

355
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,514
I need a stick.

356
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,388

358
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,875
Oh, shit.

359
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,217
All right,
give me some room.

360
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,588
It's gnoss.

361
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,492
How old do you think
that thing is?

362
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,554
- Take one of the planks off the window.
- No way.

363
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,692
Just one board. One minute.
It'll save your life. Just trust me.

364
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,930
- No.
- One board.

365
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,598
One minute. Home free.

366
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,807
Okay. Make it quick.

367
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,091
- You ready?
- Yeah.

368
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,153
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Showing superiority.

369
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,132
The scent of their dead
may drive them back.

370
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,808
- You see 'em?
- Is there like a call or something?

371
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,049
Come on, you
monkey motherfuckers!

372
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,011
Come on!!!

373
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,454
You can't fuck with man!

374
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,825
Sweet.

375
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,022
Whoa.

376
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,968
There's two of 'em.

377
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,439
(creature growls)

378
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,841
It's like they're wearing
dead animals or something.

379
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,950
Hey! It's working!
You're a genius.

380
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,790
See? What did I tell ya?

381
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,956
HEROINE:
Wait. There's a third.

382
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,490
It's like a family.
It's a goddamn family.

383
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,230
And we just killed their baby.

384
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:25,072
(creature howls,
then bellows)

385
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,539
Holy shit! She ate it!

386
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,641
She didn't even chew it, man.
She just swallowed it.

387
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,010
Oh, dear.

388
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,680
What? What's he doing?

389
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,189
They're humpin'!

390
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,856
Oh, man.

391
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,830
The monsters are
doin' it doggie-style.

392
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,389
Monster sex.

393
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,435
(car alarms blares)

394
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,736
(remote chirps,
car alarms stops)

395
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,834
Where you goin', boss?
You be careful, boss.

396
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,072
(growling)

397
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,638
HEROINE:
What is that?

398
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,245
BEER GUY:
Dude... took a dump.

399
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,914
HEROINE:
No... it's moving, stupid.

400
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,154
BOSSMAN:
Ohh... spread out.

401
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,096
- (squealing)
- God almighty!

402
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,394
It's one of the little bastards.

403
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,310
Any more ideas,
Animal Planet?

404
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,780
I was just bein' proactive.

405
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,409
Hey, dipshit.
I didn't see you workin', did I?

406
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,350
Oh, go douche, Grandpa.

407
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:43,521
Well, what now? Huh?!

408
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,355
Well, what now? Huh?!

409
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,416
We're stuck in here, that's what.

410
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,962
BOSSMAN:
If you don't mind me askin'...

411
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,828
how'd you run into these things?

412
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,866
We dnopped oun dauglhten off
at my mom's lhouse...

413
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:09,709
my little ginl Clhanlie. My baby.

414
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,976
It was only fon tlhe niglht.

415
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,681
Tlhen suddenly... we lhit it.

416
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:25,394
We lost contnol of tlhe can.
It spun and flipped.

417
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,888
And I was tlhnown fnom tlhe can.

418
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,232
Its lhead was in tlhe noad.

419
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,164
Tlhat's wlhen tlhey came.

420
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,106
It's road-kill revenge.

421
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:49,613
Well, I'd like to be the first
to thank you and your dead husband

422
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,780
for draggin' this fuck fest
into my tavern.

423
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,984
The only thing we brought here
was a heads-up that saved your ass.

424
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,924
This is not my fault.

425
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,826
You pissed off the wrong clan, lady.

426
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,230
Maybe all they want's you.

427
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:08,432
Maybe all they want's the person that
ran over their old granddaddy in a car.

428
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,134
And maybe they can have you
on a silver platter,

429
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,676
apple in fuckin' mouth.

430
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,337
You shoulda thought of that
before we killed their child

431
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,075
and stuck it outside on a pike.

432
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,880
No need to get menstrual.

433
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,648
That was a dumb fuckin' idea, man.

434
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,384
BEER GUY:
Ow! Shit!

435
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,720
Fuck!

436
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,752
What the fuck's happening, man?!
What the fuck is this shit?!

437
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,559
Just don't touch it, okay?
Leave it alone.

438
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,497
- You're making it worse.
- You tell me to leave it alone?

439
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,626
You get puked on by a monster

440
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,933
and you tell me
how that feels, huh?

441
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,974
I'm rottin' here, and nobody
could give a shit!

442
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,566
I'm dying, all right?!

443
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,839
I'm fuckin' dying!

444
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,972
I am upper-case fucked!

445
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,016
You don't give a shit, man!

446
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,949
You don't give a shit, either!

447
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,510
All you guys don't fuckin'
care about me!

448
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,614
I don't care.
Go suffer somewhere else.

449
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,321
Get the fuck away from me.

450
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:08,491
(anguished groan)
Ohh, God! Fuck, that hurts!

451
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:12,468
Look, somebody's got
to know sometlhing about this.

452
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,629
This stuff doesn't just
happen out of the blue.

453
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,435
You.

454
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,275
GRANDMA: What?

455
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,111
- You know something.
- Huh?

456
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,086
- Yeah, you're old. You've seen things.
- I don't know anything.

457
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,054
- Easy, cowboy.
- Hey, back off me, Whitey!

458
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,954
I'm interrogating her.

459
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,890
She's old.
Old people know things,

460
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,894
like legends and tall tales and shit.

461
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:42,228
No. No. Really,
I don't know anything.

462
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,289
Come on, spill it.

463
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,201
- Spill it, or I'll get rough.
- I don't know anything!

464
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,705
Why don't you ask him?
He's old.

465
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,607
- Start diggin'.
- Ahh, sheesh.

466
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,872
Back off.
She doesn't know anything.

467
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,880
Yeah, allegedly.

468
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,848
HEROINE: It doesn't matter where
they fucking came from.

469
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,784
They're here. Either we kill them
or they kill us. That's it.

470
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,879
BOZO:
Hey, no offense, Xena...

471
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,586
but by the way things are going,
looks like we need another chief,

472
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,924
somebody that knows
the lay of the land,

473
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,089
somebody with a little moxie.

474
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,025
Somebody like myself.

475
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:23,029
(creatures growl
in distance)

476
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,970
- BEER GUY: Aah.
- Careful.

477
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,706
I think we're gonna be all right.

478
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,943
I think we're gonna be okay, guys.

479
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,646
(Beer Guy groaning)

480
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,245
Ohh!

481
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,894
Yeah. I think we're
gonna be all right.

482
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:50,127
This is just some leaky barrel
radiation toxic dump waste

483
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,865
enviro-crap freak-beast accident
that crawled out of the sewer, man.

484
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,567
That's all this is.
We're gonna be all right.

485
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,271
I think the experts, they're gonna be
showin' up any minute to fix this up.

486
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,779
You know, some of those green guys?

487
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,373
Those guys with
the real can-do attitude and the tanks

488
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,078
and M-16s and torpedoes and...

489
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,280
Hey! Can you just give it a break?

490
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:14,756
Those guys are en noute.
You hear 'em?

491
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,926
They're comin'.

492
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,627
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Yeah, be careful.

493
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,536
I don't see a thing.
I can't see a thing.

494
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,100
Aah! Aah!

495
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,938
(Beer Guy screaming)

496
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,084
Give me my eye back!!!

497
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,709
- Jeez!
- Olh.

498
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,878
(laughing)

499
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:12,016
Hmm. Ahem.

500
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,643
Hmm. Ahem.

501
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,710
Does everyone agree
that the monsters are still out there?

502
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,382
Huh, chief?
- Yeah, no slhit. Sherlock.

503
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,859
I have some sweats
behind the bar in a... in a bag.

504
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,227
Tha-thank you.

505
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,462
- They coordinated that strike.
- Yeah, I know.

506
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,973
- I'm gonna need more shells.
- Yeah, tell me about it, missy.

507
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,406
A.45's got six shots.

508
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,706
I got two refills.

509
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,375
- In my locker in the basement I got...
- (creatures slamming walls)

510
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,884
...I got maybe some more shells.

511
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,319
Ah!

512
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,550
Jeez.

513
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,685
And... I got this.

514
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,133
(crashing, shrieking)

515
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,638
Shhh...

516
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,836
...shit.

517
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,914
Honey, why don't you just
leave the offense to us?

518
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,349
You need a whole lot more than that
to get out of here alive.

519
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,580
Oh, now you got
somethin' to say.

520
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,887
You young'uns.
You worry about weapons.

521
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,360
- I'm thinkin' strategy.
- Oh. And what's that?

522
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,865
Sit still...
and look less like a meal.

523
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,391
That's for bears and sharks,
Chunky Chew.

524
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,064
How do you tolerate him?

525
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,767
He's an ass, but he's my brother.

526
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,039
I've stood everywhere. Nothin'.

527
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,170
Didn't you say you had a radio?

528
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,876
Upstairs, back of my closet.
Little slidin' door.

529
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:31,320
- (thudding)
- Channel 9's the emergency frequency.

530
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,855
Have fun.

531
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,984
All right. I'm gonna go
to the basement for supplies.

532
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,962
And you... you're going upstairs.

533
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,361
Heh.

534
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,333
Let's not get carried away.

535
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,199
Step up, chief.
Ain't you got a pair?

536
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,006
Watch it.

537
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,471
Yeah.

538
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,106
Okay, yeah. Shotgun.

539
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,116
All right, partner,
you're comin' with me.

540
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,345
Whoa. I don't know about that, bub.

541
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,115
I mean, I ain't exactly
no Billy the Kid.

542
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,214
Yeah, but you're slow,
and that's helpful.

543
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,590
Just stay close.
Who else is comin'?

544
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,253
I'll go with ya.

545
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,323
What are you gonna do,
throw your teeth at 'em?

546
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,526
Just sit down, Cocoon.

547
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,006
BOZO:
You. You're comin' with me.

548
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,337
(crashing, clanking)

549
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,000
Keys.

550
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,040
- You're locked in.
- What?

551
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,879
These two will be
on the other side waiting for you.

552
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,350
If you become food,

553
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,115
I don't want a set of keys in the belly
of one of those things.

554
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,247
Don't get your hopes up.

555
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,755
Any volunteers
for the basement?

556
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,792
I'll go.

557
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,600
(crashing,
creatures growling)

558
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,348
(clatter, glass breaking)

559
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,324
All right. I don't want to hear
any of this "Where is the key?"

560
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,861
"I dropped the key."
I want out. I want out.

561
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,829
BARTENDER:
You just find that fucking radio.

562
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,194
We'll get you out.

563
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,096
We got your front, bro.

564
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,533
It's your "back."
"We got your back."

565
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,421
(glass breaking,
growling in distance)

566
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,724
Shit.

567
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,423
Okay.

568
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,900
You keep that handy.

569
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,403
- You wish me luck, girls.
- All right.

570
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:43,908
(floorboards creak)

571
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,578
BOZO:
I'm okay. I'm okay.

572
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,320
I'm okay! I'm okay!

573
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:55,018
I'm okay... l'm okay.

574
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:59,961
(crashing in distance,
thumping, creature shrieks)

575
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,104
Come on.

576
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,443
Just breathe...

577
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,277
just breathe.

578
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,313
Come on... come on.

579
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,863
Aah!

580
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,744
Come on...

581
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,281
just breathe.

582
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,142
Unh!

583
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,182
Easy. Easy.

584
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:35,916
Aah! Augh!

585
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,094
(squealing, wings flapping)

586
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,691
It's okay! It's just a bat.

587
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,667
It's just a bat.

588
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,659
Come on, hurry up.

589
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,131
Come on, you motherfucker.

590
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,909
(static)

591
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,677
Hello.

592
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,807
Is anyone out there?

593
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:38,480
Look, we need help. The Bear Tavern.
Send guns. And tanks.

594
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,544
(floorboards creak)

595
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,885
(monsters roar)

596
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,448
Aaahhh!

597
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,256
I repeat! I repeat! S.O.S.!

598
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,092
S.O.S.! Calling all cars!

599
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,892
(screaming)

600
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,839
Okay! I'm ready to come out!

601
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,035
I'm neady to come out now!

602
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:02,901
Oh...

603
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,041
"Oh"?
What do you mean, "Oh"?!

604
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,248
Help! Help!

605
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,190
Cheese and crackers.

606
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,855
(crashing, shrieking)

607
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,831
Goddamnit, open up!

608
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,958
Come on!

609
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,161
The goddamn key busted.

610
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,794
Old man! Help!

611
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,633
Goddamnit. Lhelp!!!

612
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,976
Help!!!

613
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,034
Old man!

614
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,912
(monster shrieking)

615
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,048
The monster's cock
is stuck in the door!

616
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:52,920
Aaahhh!

617
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,864
Fuck!

618
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,334
Help!

619
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,240
Shit!

620
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,717
I thought that was it
for a second there.

621
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,344
Hold me, brother.

622
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,718
What happened?

623
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,782
Papa Beast got neutered, missy.

624
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,221
Oh... good one.

625
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:39,336
If they can't reproduce,
then we're one step closer.

626
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,398
A big step.

627
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,410
Now is the time
to band together.

628
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,779
We need to rise up
against these creatures of the night.

629
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:51,378
These monsters are no match
for the human spirit.

630
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:56,415
We can do it.
We just need to believe in each other,

631
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,926
believe in all of us.

632
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,259
We need to make a stand.

633
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,561
Right here, right now.

634
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,598
Dude...

635
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,935
are you gay?

636
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,439
Look...

637
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,847
those monsters were clawing
those nails out upstairs.

638
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,350
They're like Mensa monsters.

639
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,785
BOSSMAN: They're gonna need
a lot more than claws

640
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,846
to pop out these boards down here.

641
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,721
They'll need a crowbar or somethin'.

642
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,320
(crashing,
monsters roaring)

643
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,463
- We gotta find a way out. Now.
- I have a really good idea.

644
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,500
We could all run outside
to our cars

645
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,626
and we could spread out
in different directions.

646
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,329
That's a goddamn suicide trip.

647
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,895
- But if we all stick together...
- Hey, half of us can't run,

648
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,907
and one of us
can't even walk, hon.

649
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,602
Hanging out isn't looking
too much better.

650
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,338
Even I can admit that.

651
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,778
Hey. Hey. Ow.

652
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:29,842
Hey, what about the basement
hatch door?

653
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,820
What about it?

654
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,378
We... we could trick 'em.

655
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:38,157
That could be our... our escape.

656
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,288
The... the... the monsters
don't know about it.

657
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,060
It's a... it's a... it's a...
sh... sh...

658
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,568
shh... shh...

659
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,104
It's a sec... secret hatch.

660
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:52,733
Oh, crap. Ohh...

661
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:58,705
Has anyone got lip balm...
I can borrow?

662
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,810
- Fucked up and stupid.
- HOT WHEELS: Look, it's true.

663
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,980
If we just go out there, no matter
how quiet or fast we are, we're dead.

664
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,183
But if we can draw them away
to the other side of the bar,

665
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,725
we at least got a chance.

666
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,785
Do either of you have any...
a can of hairspray or anything?

667
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,728
Yeah, I do in my purse.

668
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,426
You put in some household cleaner
and some low-grade booze,

669
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,093
and you got yourself a distraction.

670
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,659
HEROINE:
What about a car?

671
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,897
Whose car is close?

672
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,906
You gonna climb
through that hatch down there?

673
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,601
- Yeah.
- My truck's the closest,

674
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,506
but there ain't no way
it's gonna haul the whole lot.

675
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,442
- Is it gassed?
- Fully.

676
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,775
- Four-door?
- Two.

677
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,075
- How many fit?
- Six.

678
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,514
- Max?
- Seven.

679
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,017
Ten. It's gonna fit ten.

680
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,951
Ten clowns couldn't
fit in that truck.

681
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,649
Here's a plan. Two of us go.
One to drive, one to defend.

682
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,248
We back up to the bar,
and tear ass out of here.

683
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,986
Not good odds, missy.

684
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,223
My daughter is waiting for me.
I don't have a choice.

685
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,456
Okay, I'm in.

686
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,402
No, ma'am. It would be an honor
to accompany you

687
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,065
on this dangerous journey.

688
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,200
- All right.
- You're not gonna make it, hon.

689
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,608
I'm sorry.

690
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,942
Sooner or later
that wall is coming down.

691
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,346
If we stay, we die.

692
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,743
What's the distraction?

693
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,684
- Well, they want to eat us, right?
- Yeah.

694
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,189
- (crash)
- Let's give 'em something to eat.

695
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,084
BOZO: Uh-oh.

696
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,260
Turn on the light.

697
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,840
Which one?
The boy or the girl?

698
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,899
The girl.

699
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,141
Catch!

700
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,348
Ohh!

701
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,817
Oh, God.

702
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,844
(grunts)

703
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,720
All right.
Body bomb is good to go.

704
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,355
This is simple.
I plug in, and she goes boom.

705
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,423
We're goin' to hell.
Right to hell.

706
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,867
This chick is more useful dead
than you are alive. Will you shut up?

707
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:04,532
Yeah, we'll just run this cord
upstairs there

708
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,839
where we been attacked
twice already...

709
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,573
then Fucko and I
drop her through a hole

710
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,444
without making a sound,

711
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,484
and trick the smartest creatures
I ever seen

712
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:19,352
into taking a bite out of her
instead of us.

713
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,185
That's real simple.

714
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,558
Hey, I already had my moment.
How come I have to go upstairs again?

715
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,529
'Cause you're lucky.

716
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,990
You see these peanut barrels?

717
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,625
We line up some planks,

718
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,604
when that wall comes down...
we roll 'em out.

719
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,932
Just like Donkey Kong.

720
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,705
Dipshit.

721
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,445
I don't believe in guns.

722
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,576
This isn't a time for
a political stance, hot shot.

723
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,814
This won't run out of ammo.

724
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,328
I want this back.

725
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,496
BOSSMAN: Hey.

726
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,706
Don't monkey with my stereo.

727
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,282
Yeah.

728
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:25,822
How does it feel?

729
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,653
How does it feel?

730
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,625
Uh, okay.

731
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:34,061
Good. Do you mind if I
take a look at it real quick?

732
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,531
- No.
- I'll try not to hurt you.

733
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,794
(gasps)

734
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,267
How's it look?

735
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,303
- Uh...
- Is it gettin' better?

736
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,603
Maybe.

737
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,200
Is it healin' up?

738
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:54,578
I'm just gonna
swish out my mouth.

739
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,414
Is it gettin' better?

740
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,114
- Yeah, looks pretty good.
- Okay.

741
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,248
(crying)

742
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:03,715
(retching)

743
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,371
BOZO:
You should be a nurse.

744
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,911
Thanks.

745
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,075
Can you mend a broken heart?

746
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,681
I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

747
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:37,619
- Tease.
- Asshole.

748
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,896
(coughing)

749
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,263
Ohh... ohh...

750
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,077
Bet this place is creepy
in the daytime, too.

751
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,919
Pull that chair down.

752
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,687
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!

753
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,748
Fuckin' monster.

754
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:43,918
Hyah!!!

755
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,076
- Up and over.
- Okay.

756
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,756
You and I have
a lot of similarities.

757
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,730
Strong, resolute...

758
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,790
You need to be quiet.

759
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:28,599
(whispering) I'm sorry.
I talk when I get nervous.

760
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,662
Quiet. Come on.

761
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,711
It's just that it's been a while
since someone was horribly killed,

762
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:41,375
and it seems like the opportune time
for someone to get, I don't know, offed.

763
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,818
What did I say?

764
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,617
- Quiet.
- Sorry. I'll stop now.

765
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,122
(raps on ceiling)

766
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,992
We're up.

767
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,588
(grunting)

768
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,032
Come on, you lazy bastard,
I can't do it all.

769
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:25,987
(raps on ceiling)

770
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,835
Get on up there. Chop-chop.
In you go.

771
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,141
Get up there!

772
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,555
(all screaming)

773
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,894
Holy shit! She's alive.

774
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,433
Help me.

775
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,868
No, she's not.

776
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,407
(stomps on floor)

777
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:17,010
- (raps on floor)
- Okay, let's do this.

778
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,078
Help me.

779
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,416
- No. No!
- Help me.

780
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,558
Hey!

781
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:36,862
Get the cord!

782
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,967
Get it, goddamn it!
Come on, grab it, you dumb-ass!

783
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,337
Grab it!
Get the goddamn thing!

784
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,967
Get it! Get the fuckin' thing!

785
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:55,273
BOSSMAN:
Put tlhe plug in. Damnit! Now! Do it!

786
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,117
God almighty!

787
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,889
Come on. Man!

788
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,890
Now!

789
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,124
Come on! Auggh...

790
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,531
(gasps)

791
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,167
Shit.

792
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,449
(boards breaking)

793
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:36,183
Great men will write
about my bravery.

794
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,927
(panting)

795
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,354
Hey.

796
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,292
When we get downstairs...

797
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,096
...our story's the same, right?

798
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,238
Hey.

799
01:01:56,245 --> 01:02:02,081
I can stick this in your mouth,
get all dramatic, and ask again, but...

800
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,176
what about if I just say please?

801
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,085
TUFFY: Keep going for the truck!
I'll draw them away!

802
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,056
Hey, over here!

803
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,924
Fucking monsters!

804
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,725
(gunslhots)

805
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,231
(creature roars)

806
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,807
BARTENDER:
What the hell are you doing?

807
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:33,747
HEROINE: I think he's going
for the truck. I couldn't make it!

808
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,717
You gotta help me unlock it!

809
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,879
Stop! Stop!

810
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,320
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

811
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,483
They can't get in here!
We agreed!

812
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,652
Just calm down.
Just take it easy.

813
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,457
Drop it!
Drop it!

814
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,090
- Okay.
- Drop it!

815
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,634
Please let me in. Hurry! They're...

816
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,533
(grunting and struggling)

817
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,437
Ohh! Aaahhh!

818
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,509
Open the fucking thing!
I'm gonna fucking die!

819
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,486
- You're killing her!
- Put the gun down, son.

820
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,648
Don't let it in!
We'll all die!

821
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,091
- (creature roars)
- They got her.

822
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,650
They got her.

823
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,621
Back off! Get away!

824
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:33,007
If you could stop trying to
get people killed, that'd be great.

825
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,064
Fuck.

826
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,402
You motherfucken!

827
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,347
You ain't got a chance
without me, dumb-ass...

828
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,519
(body drops to floor)

829
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,716
(weak choking)

830
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,169
Arrgghh!

831
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,801
(panting)

832
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,453
Hold it!

833
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,229
Now we both got a secret,
don't we?

834
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:45,636
Arrggh!

835
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,807
Hey, she's outside.

836
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:48,509
We've got to get her
out of there. Come on.

837
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:49,879
- She ain't comin' back.
- What?

838
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:51,944
She's gone.

839
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,293
What happened?

840
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:11,970
They got her, that's all.

841
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:16,304
We tried.

842
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,709
That's it.

843
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,080
That's the fuckin' end of it.

844
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,852
That's the fucking... end of it.

845
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:33,923
Unh!

846
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,530
Ohh! Fuck.

847
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:16,964
Ah, fuck it.

848
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:38,618
TUFFY:
Hey, you guys...

849
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,628
Our plan is... is... is good,

850
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,191
and... and that truck is coming.

851
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,896
If we all just stick together, we...

852
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,398
Hey!

853
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,371
If anyone has a right to have
a complete meltdown right now,

854
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:57,571
it's me.

855
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,079
But right now,
I don't have the time,

856
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,638
because right now
you morose motherfuckers

857
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,048
are gonna get off your ass
and get ready to roll.

858
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:05,982
'Cause if those things
are gonna fuck with us...

859
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,044
(cocks gun)

860
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,715
...we're gonna fuck with 'em right back.

861
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,892
Now, who's with me?

862
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,270
BOSSMAN: Yeah, y'all go ahead
and make a run for it.

863
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,035
Make it happen. Just...

864
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:29,202
you convoy out of here
and save the day.

865
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,940
Me, I'm gonna stay right here,

866
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,208
wait for help,

867
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,649
and, uh, limp out of here
to safety.

868
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,450
(chuckles wearily)

869
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,286
Y'all go ahead, though.

870
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:46,226
Storm out of here,
make a bunch of racket.

871
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,456
They won't even notice me.

872
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,396
(chuckles)

873
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,263
They like food that moves.

874
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,426
Aah!

875
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:57,302
- (creature shrieks and roars)
- On the tables, now!

876
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,806
I'm not getting near it!

877
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,603
(screaming and shouting)

878
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,613
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

879
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,515
Aaaahhh!!!

880
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:22,194
Get off him! Get off him!

881
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,993
(screaming and shouting)

882
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,469
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

883
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,271
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

884
