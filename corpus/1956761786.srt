1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:04,674
- Go...
- Go, team!

2
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:07,574
Just over five years ago,
we all said goodbye

3
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:11,200
to NBC's iconic hit series
"Parks and Recreation".

4
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:12,908
That is a series wrap.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,367
And tonight, the entire
cast is getting back together

6
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:18,699
for a one-night-only reunion special.

7
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,071
- We're back.
- What?!

8
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,635
But first, join us as we look back

9
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:24,699
at many of your favorite moments...

10
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:27,034
Uh-oh!

11
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:29,324
... and hear from the
stars who made us laugh

12
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:31,232
for seven incredible seasons.

13
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,487
I think it's the best
cast in television.

14
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:36,367
Being on this show has
been the time of my life.

15
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:41,199
Welcome to "The Paley Center
Salutes 'Parks and Recreation'."

16
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:45,201
_

17
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:46,741
_

18
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:49,449
Tell us a little bit about this show.
What is it about?

19
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:50,783
Well, the show takes place

20
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,054
in the Parks and Recreation Department,

21
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:54,908
of which I am the deputy director.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,023
Leslie Knope is very,
very serious about her job.

23
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,648
She's a complete optimist.

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,856
I'm barely 34, and I've already landed

25
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,357
a Parks Department
exploratory subcommittee.

26
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,981
I'm a rocket ship!

27
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:10,481
We kind of follow her journey

28
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:17,233
of realizing how good intentions
are often not enough.

29
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,939
That was really good.

30
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,856
I'll tell you if I did a good dry run.

31
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,150
That was really good. You
guys are gonna use that.

32
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,856
We thought of the show
as the comedy version

33
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:31,267
of "The West Wing", where
"The West Wing" was, like,

34
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:34,899
about the big, gigantic
international crises.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,648
And we thought that the
comedy version of that

36
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,345
would be on a very small,
local level in a small town

37
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:41,106
in a small department in that town.

38
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:43,898
Ladies and gentlemen, the
world-famous Li'l Sebastian.

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,065
- What?!
- Yes!

40
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:46,066
No way!

41
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,153
Li'l Sebastian!

42
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:48,731
Oh, my God!

43
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,856
I never thought I'd get to meet him.

44
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,023
It's really him!

45
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:55,356
Well done, Leslie. Well done!

46
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:02,481
They've done an
incredible job of casting.

47
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:03,704
Everybody's hilarious

48
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,106
and brings their own
unique flavor to the show.

49
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:08,471
When the economy turns around,

50
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,774
I'm gonna have a ton of developers

51
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:11,774
who would love to exploit that property.

52
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:14,814
But the president
wants public works now.

53
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,650
The president?
What, of the United States?

54
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,940
Yes!

55
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:22,273
Could never have imagined
that I would land a role

56
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,314
that was so funny and so winning.

57
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:26,898
Behold!

58
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,481
The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.

59
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,898
Categories include...

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,107
Capitalism, God's way of determining

61
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,814
who is smart and who is poor.

62
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:38,148
13, Act 1, take 1.

63
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,164
And we're set.

64
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,439
Andy!

65
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,940
I just feel lame.

66
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,315
It's like my girlfriend is
fighting my battles for me.

67
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,315
Well, I'm just gonna talk
to these government guys

68
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:50,773
and tell them they have
to fill in this stupid pit.

69
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,096
Do you not want me to go?

70
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,814
No. Go.

71
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,481
The character of Andy is a clown

72
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,482
that I have been
working on my whole life.

73
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:04,189
He's got this golden
retriever-like quality.

74
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:08,439
He's earnest and sweet
and dumb but confident.

75
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,378
It's a funny combination to get to play.

76
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,148
Uh-oh! Nailed it.

77
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,189
I didn't think I'd ever be
on this show to begin with.

78
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,561
I've never been on a TV show before,

79
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:21,023
and I don't even know
how I got onto this one.

80
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,980
Is there any job you've seen around here

81
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,314
that you think you might
want to try to do someday?

82
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:28,816
Um, I haven't really thought about it.

83
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:37,024
You know, you remind me
of me when I was your age.

84
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,690
How is that possible?

85
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:43,024
April, you're like an
angel with no wings.

86
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,648
So like a person.

87
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,898
And action!

88
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,731
- So, I mean...
- No, not necessarily.

89
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,023
I just feel like there's definitely...

90
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:57,357
I play a nurse who comes in at first

91
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:01,024
as kind of just somebody who
wants to see something change,

92
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,190
and then we all start to work together.

93
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,648
It's not my full-time
job, but it's my cause.

94
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,064
I am gonna make a vow now that
I will do whatever it takes

95
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,856
to get this pit filled in.

96
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,773
Even if it takes two months.

97
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,064
Whoo!

98
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,731
Guys, settle, please. Very quiet.

99
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:21,439
How many times have I told
you not to walk in my eye line?

100
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:24,399
All I can think about
is Captain Mustache

101
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,106
plowing my ex-wife.

102
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:29,065
Tom's basically like the guy in
your office when you look over

103
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,731
and he's just, like, IM'ing all day

104
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,399
or looking at celebrity websites.

105
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,439
Sometimes you got to work a
little so you can ball a lot.

106
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:42,232
He thinks he's kind of like the
Kanye West of local government.

107
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,231
Once a year, Donna and I
spend a day treating ourselves.

108
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,732
What do we treat ourselves to?

109
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,231
- Clothes.
- Treat yo' self.

110
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,607
- Fragrances.
- Treat yo' self.

111
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,040
- Massages.
- Treat yo' self.

112
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,512
- Mimosas.
- Treat yo' self.

113
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,774
- Fine leather goods.
- Treat yo' self.

114
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,459
It's the best day of the year.

115
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,107
♪ The best day of the year ♪

116
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:00,731
I think Tom and Donna are
better outside of business.

117
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,939
They're better when
they're just chilling

118
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,273
and pampering themselves.

119
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,107
Relaxation lesson number one...

120
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:10,940
Acupuncture is great for
your back and your rear.

121
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:14,606
Needles in your face,
pleasure in your base.

122
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,106
Let's reset.

123
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,564
Feel like you're really
close to me. Sorry.

124
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,440
If you hit your mark, I wouldn't be.

125
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,773
Jerry, ultimately, has
a smile on his face.

126
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,774
He can be cut at the knees,

127
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:30,107
and he might initially react to that,

128
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:33,439
but just give him a few minutes,
and it's gonna all be okay.

129
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,023
We're completely swamped.
All hands on deck.

130
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,023
Ron, do you need help with anything?

131
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,538
No, we're good. Thanks.

132
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,814
In fact, you can head home early.

133
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:45,982
When the opportunity came
up to work on the show,

134
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,148
it was a no-brainer.

135
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,649
It was an immediate, "Yeah,

136
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,981
and when do I show up, and can
I do it for free?" sort of thing.

137
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,648
I'm not doing it for free.

138
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,939
I really like your shirt.

139
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,232
So, I'd like to talk about

140
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:00,981
where you think there's
waste within your department.

141
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,471
- There is none.
- Where do I start?

142
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:06,648
What I love about Chris Traeger

143
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,482
is his unrelenting enthusiasm.

144
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:15,814
He is the most positive
person in the world.

145
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,524
Scientists believe that
the first human being

146
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,314
who will live 150 years
has already been born.

147
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,357
I believe I am that human being.

148
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,857
Action!

149
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:32,356
The success of the show is
dependent on the writing.

150
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,857
Our scripts are always so well-written

151
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,064
and tight and funny and layered.

152
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,898
And everybody can relate
to working with people

153
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,190
that you have nothing in common with.

154
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:44,024
We need to remember
what's important in life...

155
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:47,189
friends, waffles, and work.

156
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,357
Or waffles, friends, work.

157
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,938
Doesn't matter. But work is third.

158
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,857
There was a desire to
do an "Office" spin-off,

159
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:57,939
but then we came up with this
idea, and Amy became available.

160
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:01,065
I met Amy Poehler in
1997 in New York City,

161
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,449
and I couldn't believe
how funny she was.

162
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,347
Getting to develop a show for her

163
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,273
and to work with her every
day, it's just a writer's dream.

164
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:10,232
She was, like, my hero
when I was in high school,

165
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,398
so I feel pretty lucky
to perform with her.

166
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,722
I thought she was pretty cool.

167
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,029
I wouldn't say she was my
hero, but, yeah, she was cool.

168
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,230
She was my only hero. Only. And still.

169
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:21,273
And my hero was probably,
you know, Michael Jordan.

170
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,356
And I'd love to act with
him sometime, as well.

171
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:27,065
A very special "Parks and
Recreation" cast reunion

172
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:28,399
is just moments away.

173
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,564
- We're back.
- But first...

174
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,065
Working with a cast that's this deep

175
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,399
and has this many funny people on it,

176
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,232
you spend most of your time in the scene

177
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,440
just trying not to laugh.

178
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,940
No, it wa...

179
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,064
When "The Paley Center Salutes

180
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,525
'Parks and Recreation'" continues.

181
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,773
The most fun times for me

182
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:53,774
are always when all of us
are in a big group scene.

183
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,440
There's just something that's really fun

184
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,273
when we all get to play off each other.

185
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,940
Moving on to recycling.

186
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:00,648
Ugh!

187
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,107
- You okay, Ron?
- Just a little tooth pain.

188
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,607
I'm fine. Continue.

189
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:07,273
Okay. Each department will
be getting blue bins...

190
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,274
Ughhh!

191
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,274
Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?

192
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,940
I don't like dentists.

193
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:14,606
Just a second.

194
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,481
- Hey!
- No, no, no.

195
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,815
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

196
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,982
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

197
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,649
What the [BLEEP]

198
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,466
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry, everybody.

199
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,814
What were we talking about? Recycling?

200
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:34,149
I love every single scene
when I'm in the conference room

201
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,282
because that meant that between takes,

202
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,649
we were just laughing and
having a ball with each other.

203
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,481
And those were always my favorite.

204
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,106
You will not be hiring anyone

205
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:45,482
because my department is just
finishing up a major project.

206
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,483
Excuse me.

207
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,189
Everything I'm wearing is suede!

208
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,814
Everything I'm wearing is suede!

209
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,482
- Everything I'm wearing is suede!
- Excuse me, everybody.

210
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:01,900
Attention!

211
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,356
I think you'll agree
that this department

212
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:09,189
could use a little leadership.

213
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:12,064
Kamikaze!

214
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,856
It's a true delight to be
able to work with this cast.

215
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,357
I think it's the best
cast in television.

216
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:22,140
Ladies and gentlemen, the next mayor

217
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:25,523
of the great city of Pawnee,
Indiana... Garry Gergich.

218
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:28,189
Everyone cheers as
the balloon takes off.

219
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,189
Mayor Garry Gergich sails away.

220
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:33,689
Working with a cast that's this deep

221
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,113
and has this many funny people on it,

222
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:37,064
you spend most of your time in the scene

223
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,357
just trying not to laugh.

224
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,523
Every hero struggles with failure,

225
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,565
faces something they cannot do.

226
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,206
Andy had one of those moments

227
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,565
where he faced something just
like that a few years ago.

228
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,232
Athlete's foot of the butt.

229
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,899
No. It wa...

230
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,732
Everyone is funny and
weird and supportive,

231
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,065
and it's really, really fun.

232
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,398
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

233
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,232
Aah!

234
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,773
Aah! Aah!

235
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,439
Greg and Mike are really awesome

236
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,732
about letting us improvise,
and obviously, you know,

237
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,984
to improvise with people
like Amy is just a dream.

238
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:11,065
Do you like this new button-down?

239
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,621
Purple.

240
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:14,311
Sweater-vest combo.

241
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,398
Saw it at Brooks Brothers,
bought it off the doll.

242
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,606
I love a moment early
on when Leslie was sick

243
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,248
and I was taking her out of her office,

244
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,936
and Chris Pratt, in one of
the best improvised lines

245
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,106
on the show, he said...

246
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,475
Leslie, I typed your symptoms
into the thing up here,

247
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:35,939
and it says you could have
"network connectivity problems".

248
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:38,274
It's great to have that on
a network television show,

249
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:39,691
just sort of, "Hey, let's try this",

250
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:40,940
and just throw it against a wall.

251
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,106
There is quite literally
nothing in the world

252
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,440
that I would rather do

253
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,107
than take a tour of the
Parks and Rec Department.

254
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,774
Aah!

255
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,440
It's really fun when we
take our small, little group

256
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:55,773
of Indiana weirdos

257
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,607
and we transplant them somewhere else.

258
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,774
Can't believe we're at Hogwarts!

259
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,606
No, that's Buckingham Palace.

260
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,323
Hogwarts is fictional. Do you know that?

261
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,148
It's important to me that you know that.

262
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,649
We're in downtown Boston.

263
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,149
Boston, Massachu... What?

264
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,814
No? Oh, Chicago?

265
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,482
Alright, sorry. I
guess we're in Chicago.

266
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:16,649
The trips to Washington,
D.C., were great.

267
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,189
It was amazing being able to
work with the vice president

268
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,649
and with Madeleine Albright.

269
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,315
Can we go on a road trip?

270
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,481
I'm up for that. Can I drive?

271
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,481
Yes. I'm a really good driver.

272
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:28,483
- I bet.
- Okay.

273
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:30,189
Of course you are.

274
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,244
Honestly, I think it's just
as funny, if not funnier,

275
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,305
when the cameras are off.
We get along so well,

276
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,189
and we're all just kind
of playing all the time.

277
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,523
We actually love Jim,

278
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,912
and everyone thinks that we don't,

279
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:44,982
and for some reason, they might...

280
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:47,198
Probably because we
are so mean to Jerry,

281
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,190
but I'll tell you what,
nobody better than him.

282
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,066
Nothing but love on set, right?

283
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:55,398
Okay.

284
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,856
That's the best part, really,

285
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,690
is the people that we get to work with.

286
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,819
Or I get to work with.

287
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:04,342
I say "we" because I refer
to myself as two people.

288
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:07,033
Myself as producer and
myself as actor, you know.

289
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:08,431
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,086
And I have a dark side and a light side,

291
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,356
so I like to... so all those things.

292
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:13,523
But what were you saying?

293
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,024
Coming up...

294
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,189
It's nice to kind of have
female friendship on TV.

295
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:20,023
Hos before bros.

296
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,731
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.

297
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,023
... when "The Paley Center Salutes

298
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,816
'Parks and Recreation'" returns.

299
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,758
Early on, when we were
trying to figure out

300
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,773
the tone of the show, Amy
and I had a lot of, like,

301
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:38,523
scenes where we'd have, like, girl time.

302
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,508
They'd let us go for like 15 minutes

303
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,453
with a spy camera out here,
just us just breaking it down

304
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:47,064
about guys and life and
work and love in there.

305
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,066
I think those are probably
my most cherished memories.

306
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,922
- You are awesome.
- Yeah!

307
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,361
And you are, too.

308
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,898
- Thank you.
- You are, too.

309
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,439
- Thank you.
- You are, too, Ann!

310
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,939
- Okay! You're awesome.
- You're awesome.

311
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:02,088
It's nice to kind of have
female friendship on TV,

312
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,731
which you kind of don't see as much.

313
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:07,399
You know my code... hos before bros.

314
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,196
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.

315
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:10,606
Ovaries before brovaries.

316
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,773
Ann has a soft spot for Leslie.

317
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,731
She just really likes her,

318
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,606
and she knows her
intentions are really good

319
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:17,648
and she's got a really good heart.

320
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,148
And so she forgives her

321
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,273
some of her wild, fantastical,
unrealistic notions.

322
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:27,975
Would you be cool doing
things that a prostitute does?

323
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:29,789
Uh...

324
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,439
Minus the money?

325
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,773
- Definitely yes, then.
- Thanks, Ann.

326
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:36,606
Leslie starts a tradition
called Galentine's Day

327
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,898
where she gets all of
her gal friends together

328
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,106
and they celebrate their strong,
individual, independent selves.

329
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,274
Galentine's Day made me feel better.

330
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,314
So thanks.

331
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:49,829
Oh, Ann, you beautiful spinster.

332
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:50,856
I will find you love.

333
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,356
What? Did you say something?

334
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:53,400
Love you!

335
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,404
Leslie has kind of female role models,

336
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,981
and she is living in a time

337
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:01,689
when politics isn't
such a boys' club anymore

338
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:03,648
and includes herself in this long list

339
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,148
of women making a lot of progress.

340
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,648
And, of course, she
might be overreaching.

341
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,982
The whole city is watching.

342
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:11,482
If I can't move that
fridge onto that truck,

343
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,900
then feminism is over in this town.

344
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:23,148
I don't know why I thought
sneaking up on it would work.

345
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,648
I'd like it to be remembered
as a feminist show.

346
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,356
It's very, very lady-supportive.

347
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,649
You know what? I'm gonna
get that commission going,

348
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,981
because this inequality
has gone on long enough.

349
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:35,731
You know what? I think
men are better than women.

350
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,689
- She's kidding.
- No, I'm not.

351
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,814
They provide for us,
and we must obey them

352
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,398
because they are our masters.

353
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,648
April, stop it.

354
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,856
Leslie, you'll never land a beau
with that domineering tone.

355
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:49,148
We must always walk behind the men.

356
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,171
When I think about Amy and
I think about Mike Schur

357
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:58,023
and I think about Greg Daniels,
the common thread there is that

358
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:02,524
they're not interested in comedy
that doesn't come out of heart.

359
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,981
Leslie Knope, will you...

360
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,150
Yes!

361
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:14,731
- Marry me?
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,356
Okay, great.

363
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:18,399
I think we were all relieved...

364
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,398
I certainly was... that
they finally got together.

365
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,565
It was a long time coming.

366
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,273
You just wanted them to be happy.

367
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:27,064
Leslie, you deserve the
best, and you found it.

368
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,606
Ben, don't you dare hurt her.

369
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,856
I won't.

370
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,231
Don't laugh. She means it.

371
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,564
Yeah, I-I won't.

372
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:38,064
Seriously, son. Don't hurt her.

373
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,398
Okay, I'm not planning on hurting her.

374
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,898
- You better not be.
- I'm not.

375
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,356
Hey, Ben, you best watch yourself.

376
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,484
Why would any of you
think I would hurt Leslie?

377
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:49,232
- You're all my friends, too.
- Meh.

378
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,689
There's such great comedy,

379
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,689
but it's rooted in real
human relationships.

380
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,899
Andy and April, they're
such fun characters.

381
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,648
Like, every scene they're
in, it's fun to watch them

382
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,398
because they're so different,

383
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,107
but they complement each other
in such a weird, crazy way.

384
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:07,607
So much more beautiful than
I could've ever even imagined.

385
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:08,981
Yeah.

386
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,274
I'm trying to find a way
to be annoyed by it,

387
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:14,174
but I'm coming up empty.

388
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,773
Where's all the faces?

389
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,816
Like, the presidents.

390
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,064
We're just moments away
from the long-awaited

391
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,981
"Parks and Recreation" reunion.

392
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,731
- We back?
- We're back.

393
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:29,798
But first...

394
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,564
If you're lucky, you love what you do

395
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,939
and the people you work with
become your friends and family.

396
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:36,439
Alright. Where to first?

397
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,537
Your mother's butt.

398
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,981
... when "The Paley Center Salutes

399
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:41,733
'Parks and Recreation'" returns.

400
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:48,814
You know what they say.

401
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,981
Don't be a stranger.

402
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:55,106
After a day and a half
of shooting on the finale,

403
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,649
we're three weeks behind schedule.

404
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,689
It's starting to get real,
but it's very good.

405
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:04,356
It's sentimental stuff.

406
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,321
And it's one of the few times remaining

407
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:09,549
that all of us will be standing

408
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,315
in the same room
together filming the show.

409
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:14,523
Welcome to my last day
on "Parks and Recreation".

410
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,815
I am literally right now

411
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,648
walking down that hallway

412
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,054
to do my last scene as Chris Traeger.

413
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:24,536
So I'm very sad.

414
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:25,829
Bye.

415
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,735
If you work hard, you
spend a lot of time

416
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,189
away from your friends and your family.

417
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,189
And if you're lucky,
you love what you do

418
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,981
and the people you work with
become your friends and family.

419
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,564
And that is certainly the case here.

420
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:40,064
I think I'll just miss the people.

421
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,523
That is a series wrap on Retta.

422
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:46,231
I guess I'd like it to be remembered

423
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:52,023
as a group of friends who
really cared about each other,

424
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:56,904
who were very quirky
and odd, but it was okay.

425
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:00,856
And that is also a series
wrap on Aubrey Plaza.

426
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:04,064
It's given me a family.

427
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,731
Everyone that works on this show,

428
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,399
we all really love each other.

429
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,899
And I don't have any
family in Los Angeles,

430
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,439
so when it's over, I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

431
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,439
Cast and crew of "Parks and Recreation",

432
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:18,398
that is a series wrap on Jim O'Heir.

433
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:24,272
We've never been a fluff show.
We've never been just a show.

434
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:26,231
I think we've been special,

435
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,231
and I want to be
remembered as being special.

436
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:32,023
That is also a series
wrap on Chris Pratt.

437
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:37,564
This has been the time of my life.

438
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:40,231
Being on this show has
been the time of my life.

439
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:43,481
That is a series wrap on Nick Offerman.

440
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:49,148
It changed my life in a massive way.

441
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,273
Never dreamed I'd get to work
so closely with people like Amy.

442
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:56,481
Alright, everyone.
Your attention, please.

443
00:18:56,483 --> 00:19:00,439
That is a series wrap on Amy Poehler.

444
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:04,273
I'd like the show to be remembered

445
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:07,314
as a classic character-driven comedy

446
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:11,231
that, week to week, made you laugh,

447
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,660
made you feel something,
everything felt very earned,

448
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:16,106
and you cared about the people,

449
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:18,273
you cared about the
characters that you saw,

450
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:20,106
and every season surprised you.

451
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:23,481
That is a series wrap on
"Parks and Recreation".

452
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:43,148
Is this everybody?

453
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,856
Ann took a cab. Tom's in the trunk.

454
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:46,648
Jerry's on the roof.

455
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,773
Alright. Where to first?

456
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:49,939
Your mother's butt.

457
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,773
I'm so alone.

458
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,439
If even one of you thinks
about dry-heaving in my car,

459
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:59,088
you're all walking home.
