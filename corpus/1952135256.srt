1
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:07,601
Somewhere...

2
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:09,733
The pilot said we're over
a thousand miles off course.

3
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:12,963
- on a mysterious island...
- This place is different.

4
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:17,345
- 48 passengers...
- If we can't live together...

5
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:20,202
survived the crash
of Oceanic 815.

6
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:21,832
... we're gonna die alone.

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:27,008
- 108 days pass...
- I'm one of the survivors of flight 815.

8
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:30,828
- and six people find rescue.
- So we can go off the island?

9
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,006
- But their friends...
- Sawyer!

10
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:36,956
are left behind.

11
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:38,660
We need to go back!

12
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:41,379
And the island...

13
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,976
is suddenly...

14
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:45,280
gone.

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,620
- Wait! Don't move!
- Anyone?!

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,530
- Taking the few who remain...
- Run!

17
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,723
- on a journey...
- What the hell is going on?

18
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,022
through time.

19
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,152
We're either in the past
or we're in the future.

20
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,640
Now...

21
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:05,821
- flash forward.
- We made a mistake.

22
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,850
- Three years have passed.
- Somebody knows we're lying.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,778
The people I left behind
need our help.

24
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,383
- And those who made it home...
- It wants us to come back.

25
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:13,613
What is this place?

26
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:17,594
- find a way back...
- Ajira Airways flight 3-1-6.

27
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:19,186
to save their friends...

28
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,908
You have a bit of a
journey ahead of you.

29
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,188
- to change their fate...
- Now I know why I'm here.

30
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:27,104
- to fulfill...
- You might wanna fasten your seat belt.

31
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,703
their destiny.

32
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:31,670
There's no turning back now.

35
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,416
We're coming in for a landing.

36
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,225
Now there's a lot of press
that wanna speak to you.

37
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:48,330
They're referring to you
as the "Oceanic Six."

38
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:54,520
The journey of the survivors of Oceanic
815 has taken two very different paths,

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,318
and tonight we explore
where both have led.

40
00:01:57,348 --> 00:02:02,120
If we were to sum up season five in sort
of one simple concept, it's "going back."

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,216
The first part of the season
was about the Oceanic Six.

42
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:08,795
If we get any questions that we don't wanna
answer, let's just keep our mouths shut.

43
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:12,130
- They'll think that we're in shock.
- We are in shock, Jack.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,860
When the season started, we had our
characters in two different places.

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,980
We had this group of six characters who
had returned to the real world and then

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,868
a bunch of characters who
got left behind on the island.

47
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:26,620
The island itself had disappeared when
Benjamin Linus, the leader of the others,

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,980
turned an ancient wheel
to move the island

49
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,409
and keep it hidden from
his nemesis, Charles Widmore.

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,603
And so to protect the friends
they left behind,

51
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,357
the Oceanic Six agreed to lie
about their entire experience.

52
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:42,597
We were in the water for over a
day before the current took us in.

53
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:45,227
By then, there was
only eight of us left.

54
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:48,323
Ms. Austen, what was it like
giving birth on the island?

55
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:49,338
Scary.

56
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:52,210
Mr. Jarrah, is it possible
there are any other survivors

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,667
- from the crash yet to be discovered?
- Absolutely not.

58
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,086
We come to realize that
there's an entire chapter

59
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,400
after that for Jack and for
all the other characters.

60
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,590
They come back, and they discover there's
nothing left for them in the real world.

61
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,120
There's this sort of gnawing sensation
that there is a greater destiny to be had.

62
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,150
Hello? Who's there?

63
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,004
The island needs you.
You have to go back.

64
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:16,458
Kate is raising
Claire's son Aaron as her own.

65
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,320
She knows that Claire, who's
Aaron's mother, is now gone.

66
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,871
And the only way that she can
protect Aaron to to say he is hers.

67
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,210
- And we later realize...
- Hey!

68
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,122
emotionally, Kate is still
reeling from Sawyer's decision

69
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:30,702
- to jump off of the helicopter.
- Sawyer!

70
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,860
This man that she really loved
left her, abandoned her,

71
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,750
- decided to stay behind on the island.
- What a coward.

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,925
- He was trying to do the right thing.
- He was trying to get away from you.

73
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:41,916
She's trying to heal
the emotional scar left

74
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:44,192
by Sawyer taking himself
out of the equation.

75
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,053
He made his choice.
He chose to stay.

76
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:50,240
And ever since that moment, Jack
has wondered, what did he say to her?

77
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,069
- Why won't you tell me?
- Because he wouldn't want me to.

78
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,793
And the fact that he still has this
jealousy, what does this mean for them?

79
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:58,835
You have problems.
You need to figure them out,

80
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,510
'cause I can't have you
like this around my son.

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,898
You're not even related to him!

82
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:10,244
Excuse me, Mr. Widmore?
I'm Sun Kwon.

83
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:12,623
Sun leaves the island,
and she's devastated

84
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,153
because she's just seen
her husband die.

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Jin!

86
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,166
And there's one other catch. Sun was
pregnant when she left the island,

87
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:24,400
so they now have a daughter,
Ji Yeon, who Jin has never met.

88
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,648
I miss you so much.

89
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:31,410
She wants to bring to justice the
person who she blames for Jin's death,

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,296
and she goes
to Charles Widmore.

91
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:36,220
You mentioned that you and
I had common interests.

92
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,209
Why don't you tell me
exactly what they might be?

93
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,251
To kill Benjamin Linus.

94
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:45,507
Ben left the island when he turned
the wheel below the orchid station...

95
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:49,582
and was transported to the Tunisian
desert, ten months in the future.

96
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:52,025
I just want to bury my wife in peace.

97
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,780
Mr. Jarrah? There's a woman outside.
She said she knows you,

98
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,961
but she wasn't on the list
of family members.

99
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,005
Nadia?

100
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:03,311
Sayid is incredibly happy because he's
reunited with Nadia, the love of his life.

101
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:08,193
And things seem to be going great
until Nadia's struck by a car.

102
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:12,023
Ben claims Charles Widmore was
responsible for Nadia's death.

103
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,220
Why would these people
want to murder her?

104
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,176
I don't know.

105
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:18,656
His heart is black now because
his wife has been killed.

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,941
He very happily goes to work for
Benjamin Linus and starts killing people.

107
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,571
Is this your first time
in the Seychelles?

108
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,580
He believes that he is assassinating
associates of Charles Widmore,

109
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,710
who, in the opinion of Benjamin
Linus, is sort of the big bad guy.

110
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,730
I just killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility for the last week.

111
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,345
I want you to come with me.

112
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,943
- We're not going back, are we?
- No, just somewhere safe.

113
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,321
I don't think we should lie, dude.
I mean, the island disappeared-- Bloop!

114
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,755
You think anyone's gonna believe that?
They're gonna think you're crazy.

115
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,199
Hurley really resists telling this lie.

116
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,029
Of all our characters, he's sort
of the most morally grounded.

117
00:05:58,336 --> 00:05:59,864
Surprise!

118
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,553
Interesting choice of theme.

119
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,483
Yeah. My Mom...
really doesn't get it, dude.

120
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,770
For a while, Hurley seems to be
living a fairly good existence.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,312
He gives away all his money.

122
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:11,789
He occasionally sort of crashes
at his parents' house.

123
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,419
But then he starts to become
haunted by visions of Charlie.

124
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,846
Help! Help!

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,208
What the hell
is wrong with you?

126
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,585
He gets himself thrown
into a psychiatric hospital.

127
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,568
- I saw Charlie.
- Take your meds, Hurley.

128
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:29,685
Charlie said someone's gonna
be visiting you, too... soon.

129
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,442
Jack Shephard was the character who
wanted the most to get off the island.

130
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,499
Good-Bye, John.
The rest of us are going home.

131
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,728
- You're not supposed to go home.
- Then what am I supposed to do?!

132
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,966
You know that you're
here for a reason.

133
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:45,446
And if you leave,
that knowledge is gonna eat you alive.

134
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,299
Once he got back
to the real world, however,

135
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,900
he discovered that things were
not what he expected.

136
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,095
I miss you.

137
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,284
He finally gets to bury his father,
even though he doesn't have the body.

138
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,292
- He resumed his practice.
- Jack?

139
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:59,630
He had these problems in that he
was seeing his dead father around,

140
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,127
and that was very disturbing.
He starts popping pills and drinking.

141
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,419
The great and glorious life
that he was expecting

142
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,996
to return to off the island
didn't really exist.

143
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,965
But he's very steadfast in his
decision to leave the island.

144
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:12,220
I don't think we did the
right thing, Jack.

145
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,130
Hurley...

146
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,340
- It's gonna do everything it can--
- We're never going back!

147
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,240
He's not a guy who
changes his mind often,

148
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,197
but then something very
significant happened,

149
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:22,754
and that's that John Locke
is off the island.

150
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:27,640
Locke returned to civilization three
years after the Oceanic Six came home.

151
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,260
What are you doing here?

152
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,894
- We have to go back.
- Of course we do.

153
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:34,190
Jack, the people I left
behind need our help.

154
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,805
Because it's our destiny.

155
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,444
How many times are you
gonna say that to me, John?

156
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:40,601
Jack says, "I'm not gonna
pay attention to you."

157
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,481
- And Locke says...
- You're father says hello.

158
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:44,359
What?

159
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:46,367
The man who told me
how to bring you all back?

160
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:50,398
He said to tell his son hello.
He said his name was Christian.

161
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:52,940
My father is dead.

162
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,750
- He didn't look dead to me.
- I put him in the coffin!

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,442
He's dead.

164
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,454
This really emotionally devastates Jack,
and this changes his entire attitude,

165
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,096
so he starts flying again,
hoping that he'll crash.

166
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,326
Then he learns
that Locke has died.

167
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:12,357
Jack began to realize that going
back to the real world was a mistake.

168
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,766
We... were not supposed to leave.

169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,763
Yes, we were.

170
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,444
That this thing
that he had wanted,

171
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,985
not only for himself but
for all the other characters,

172
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,615
maybe that wasn't the
best thing for him.

173
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,650
And it's Locke's death that catalyzes
Jack to return to the island.

174
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,203
Hello, Jack.
Didn't mean to scare you.

175
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,450
Did he tell you that I
was off the island?

176
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,487
He told me that after I left the island,
some very bad things happened.

177
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,755
And he told me that it was
my fault for leaving.

178
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,008
And he said that I had
to come back.

179
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,538
All of you have to go back.

180
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,750
We're gonna
have to bring him, too.

181
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,100
The day the Oceanic Six
left the island,

182
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,887
John Locke was appointed
the leader of the others.

183
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,926
Hello, John.
Welcome home.

184
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,496
But his new position
did not last long.

185
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:11,623
Richard? Richard?!

186
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:12,480
Time Travel

187
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,370
There's a lot of mystery
surrounding the idea

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,571
of exactly what
is skipping through time.

189
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:19,002
Is it the island?
Is it the people on the island?

190
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,884
When the sky lit up,
where did you go?

191
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:23,042
I didn't go anywhere, John.
You went.

192
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,020
Here's what we know--
There is a donkey wheel

193
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,389
in a very, very cold place
down below the orchid station.

194
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,122
We know that when you turn it,
the island moves.

195
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:34,133
When the island disappeared it
was basically set off its axis,

196
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:36,150
and it started skipping through time.

197
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,428
Next time we see each other,
I'm not gonna recognize you.

198
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,436
You give me this.
It's a compass.

199
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,803
The only way to save the island,
John, is to get your people back here.

200
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,883
- How am I supposed to do that?
- You're gonna have to die, John.

201
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,075
Time travel had existed
on the show earlier.

202
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:56,122
We saw Desmond's consciousness
travel in the episode "The Constant."

203
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,515
Hey, hey. You okay?

204
00:09:57,635 --> 00:10:01,342
We've had Sayid listening to
a transmission from the 1940s.

205
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,933
- It could be coming from anywhere.
- Or anytime.

206
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,023
But in this season, time travel
becomes much more overt.

207
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:10,930
Whatever Ben Linus did down at
the orchid station dislodged us.

208
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,612
- Dislodged us from what?
- Time.

209
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:15,962
Our characters
have these encounters

210
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,220
with things that took place
in the island's past.

211
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,058
And none is any more significant than
Sawyer wandering through the jungle,

212
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:26,190
- seeing Kate helping Claire give birth.
- Come on, Claire! Push!

213
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,870
And this is an incredibly powerful,
emotional moment for him.

214
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,692
And we realize
that is also the night

215
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:38,008
that Locke first saw this light
shing out of the hatch.

216
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,220
That light in the sky-- It was
from the hatch, wasn't it?

217
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,720
The night that Boone died,
I was confused, scared.

218
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,829
The light came on
and shot up into the sky.

219
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:48,845
At the time, I thought it meant
something. It was just a light.

220
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,590
All these things are
happening for a reason.

221
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,501
So to tamper with them,
it's kinda like cheating.

222
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:57,238
I needed that pain
to get to where I am now.

223
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,048
And this is just a very Lockeian,
philosophical way

224
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,730
of saying the same thing
that Faraday's saying.

225
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,636
You can not change anything.
You can't.

226
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,725
If we try to do anything
different, we will fail.

227
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,050
Whatever happened, happened.

228
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,220
We discover that Jin basically
survived the explosion of the freighter

229
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,314
and he washed up on the shore and
was rescued by these French people.

230
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,050
- You Danielle Rousseau?
- Yes. That's right.

231
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,106
This is a young Rousseau
who's pregnant with Alex,

232
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:29,038
and we discover the things
that ended up driving her mad.

233
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:30,241
You!

234
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,587
- Jin?
- Sawyer?

235
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:43,570
- Well, what do you say?
- Where is Sun?

236
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,580
Our characters also find themselves
getting attacked by these flaming arrows.

237
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:50,433
Run!

238
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:53,660
And it turns out that the people who
are massacring them are the others.

239
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,263
But it's not the others that have been
terrorizing us in the present of the island.

240
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:00,985
- This is the 1954 version of the others.
- What are you doing on our island?!

241
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:04,604
And what's cool about this is we
meet Charles Widmore as a teenager.

242
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:07,580
Your name is Widmore?
Charles Widmore?

243
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,973
What's it to you?

244
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:11,894
We also meet this young
blonde woman named Ellie.

245
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:15,124
Who are you and what are you
doing on our island?

246
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,980
Daniel Faraday asked her
to bring him out to this bomb

247
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,968
that's called Jughead.
It's a hydrogen bomb.

248
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,703
And he tells her it's very dangerous,
it's leaking radiation.

249
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:25,992
You need to take it off this
platform carefully and bury it.

250
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:28,430
Is that why they moved to 1954?

251
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,830
It feels like everywhere they move to,
none of those moves were arbitrary.

252
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,760
Every one of them had significance.

253
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,230
I expect you to tell me how
to get off the island.

254
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,894
- That's very privileged information.
- Oh, no.

255
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,600
They land someplace,
and a few minutes later,

256
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,846
there's a bright flash of light.
There's this incredible noise.

257
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,813
They disappear, and they find
themselves in another point in time.

258
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:49,673
And it's causing enormous
problems for our characters.

259
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,280
Our brains have an internal
clock, a sense of time.

260
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,429
The flashes throw the clock off.

261
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,867
If you fly to a different time zone,
you're sort of off your axis.

262
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:00,270
But when you do it traveling
through time, it's much worse.

263
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,936
In fact, it can be fatal.

264
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:05,000
We have to go back to the orchid.
Ben used it to leave the island,

265
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,630
and if I can do the same thing,
I believe I can save us.

266
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,407
Hello, John. I'm here to
help you the rest of the way.

267
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,913
It's Locke's genius idea
to go turn the wheel again.

268
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:21,776
If that's what got them into this problem,
maybe that's the way it'll get them out.

269
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,303
Say hello to my son.

270
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:27,153
Sure enough, that works.
It puts the island back on its axis.

271
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:30,165
I think it's over.
I think John did it.

272
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:34,111
But the survivors were left
stranded on the island in 1974,

273
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,731
and spent the next three years
with the Dharma Initiative.

274
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,977
Locke went on
a far different journey

275
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:46,225
when he was transported to the Tunisian
desert three years in the future to 2007.

276
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:50,824
John, my name is Charles Widmore.
I met you when I was 17.

277
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,584
How long has it been for you
since we first met?

278
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:55,935
- Four days.
- That's incredible.

279
00:13:56,055 --> 00:14:00,805
Widmore wanted to get back to the island,
so he helped Locke find his friends.

280
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:03,183
The folder contains
your people's whereabouts--

281
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,869
Everyone that was
on the island that left.

282
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,477
Mira. Tienes un visitante.

283
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,489
John Locke came not only to see
Jack, but he saw Sayid, he saw Kate.

284
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,785
And John Locke says,
"You never should've left the island.

285
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:15,080
- You've gotta help your friends."
- I'm not going back.

286
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,069
- The answer is no.
- No, I'm not going anywhere with you!

287
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:22,385
You leave me alone, and you
leave the rest of them alone!

288
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:26,620
Locke believed he had failed
and saw only one option.

289
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,240
- John?
- But in Locke's despair,

290
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,578
Ben saw opportunity.

291
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,166
- Wait, John, stop!
- What are you doing here?

292
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:35,913
Locke is the man that Ben
left in charge of the island.

293
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,646
I couldn't get a single one
of them to come back with me.

294
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,708
Ben is now thinking,
maybe this is an opportunity

295
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:43,659
for me to go back and
get my old position.

296
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,810
- Jack booked a ticket.
- What?

297
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,040
From Los Angeles
to Sydney, tonight.

298
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:50,552
And if you've got Jack,
you can get the rest of them.

299
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:53,532
There's only one way I can do that,
and that's if I kill John Locke.

300
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,153
You haven't even been to Sun yet.

301
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:57,392
I promised Jin that I
wouldn't bring her back.

302
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:58,881
Jin... is alive?

303
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,040
But Locke has a very important piece
of information that Ben doesn't have.

304
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,524
There's a woman here in Los
Angeles-- Eloise Hawking.

305
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,013
That name means something to Ben.

306
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:12,193
And she knows a way to get back to the
island, so all he has to do is kill Locke.

307
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,179
So Ben kills John Locke, and then he starts
these manipulations of everybody else.

308
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,113
I'll miss you, John.
I really will.

309
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:32,843
Ben went to Eloise Hawking, hoping she
would know a way back to the island.

310
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:34,870
- Any luck?
- Yes.

311
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,104
Benjamin Linus is not the type
of guy who wants to be vanished.

312
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:41,608
His one goal in life is to be the
ruler and leader of the island.

313
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:43,536
You only have 70 hours.

314
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:46,670
So what happens if I can't
get them all to come back?

315
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,344
Then god help us all.

316
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:51,069
The only way that Benjamin Linus
can get back on the island

317
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,603
is if he gets the Oceanic Six
to want to go back.

318
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:57,383
Ben had a difficult task,
but Jack was already convinced.

319
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:58,971
Find yourself a suitcase.

320
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:02,349
If there's anything in this life
you want, pack it in there,

321
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,128
- because you're never coming back.
- Good.

322
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:06,199
The Journey Back

323
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,635
Hello, Hugo.

324
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,531
Ben started trying to manipulate them
into wanting to go back to the island.

325
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:16,432
If you come with me,
you won't ever have to lie again.

326
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:18,942
- Let me help you.
- Never, dude.

327
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:22,513
He hires a lawyer
to start harassing Kate.

328
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,738
We're here to get
a blood sample from you

329
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:27,752
- and one from your son Aaron.
- Why?

330
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,396
To determine your
relationship to the child.

331
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:32,765
This is Ben trying to put
enough guilt in Kate's mind

332
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,060
to get her to go
back to the island.

333
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,020
Why don't you leave
me and my son alone?

334
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,372
Because he's not your son, Kate.

335
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:40,272
And it's something that
kind of freaks her out.

336
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:43,265
We were in the supermarket,
and I turned around for one second,

337
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,670
- Aaron? Aaron?!
- and he was gone.

338
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,220
All I could think was,
it's about time.

339
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,500
Why would I expect
him to be taken?

340
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,542
Kate doesn't realize that she's replacing
the wound left by Sawyer with Aaron.

341
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:56,341
Because you took him, Kate.

342
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:59,627
Ironically, it's pointed out to
her by an ex-girlfriend of Sawyer's.

343
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:03,500
Sawyer broke your heart.
How else were you supposed to fix it?

344
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,842
So Kate has a change of heart.
She returns Aaron to his grandmother.

345
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,376
I told him that you'll take care of him
while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.

346
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:17,586
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to find your daughter.

347
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:22,470
Sun had no intention of
going back to the island.

348
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,604
Move away!

349
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:27,011
Instead, she was determined
to avenge Jin's death.

350
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,524
But before she's able
to kill Ben,

351
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:31,235
Ben stops her and he says,
"Your husband isn't dead,"

352
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:33,544
and he gives Sun a wedding ring--
Jin's wedding ring.

353
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:37,228
All those people back on the island,
Jin included, need our help.

354
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:39,370
And it's proof that Jin's
still alive, and that is how

355
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,775
Ben is able to convince Sun
to return to the island.

356
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:45,766
- I thought I said all of them.
- This is all I could get on short notice.

357
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:46,882
The Lamp Post

358
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:50,462
We discover that there is
a Dharma station off the island.

359
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:54,018
The Dharma Initiative
called it the Lamp Post.

360
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,785
This is how
they found the island.

361
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:59,645
And we meet this character
Eloise Hawking down there,

362
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:02,115
and she can use the
resources of the station

363
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:06,745
to determine where exactly the island
is located at any given point in time.

364
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,966
There's a commercial airline
flying from L.A. to Guam

365
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:13,110
that's going to go
right through our window.

366
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,187
Ajira Airways flight 3-1-6.

367
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,300
The show can be strange or weird or magical,
but in this case, the Dharma Initiative

368
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,000
used good old-fashioned math to find
the island. So stay in school, kids.

369
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:28,503
We just get on that flight
and we just hope that it works?

370
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,930
No, that's not all, Jack.

371
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,909
Eloise Hawking says, "It's not
just about being on this plane.

372
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:36,880
You have to try to recreate
the emotional conditions

373
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,522
surrounding you at the time
that Oceanic 815 crashed.

374
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,220
John Locke is going
to be a substitute,

375
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,862
which is why you need to give
John something of your father's.

376
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:49,756
Wherever you are, John, you
must be laughing your ass off.

377
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,078
'Cause this is even
crazier than you are.

378
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:55,480
For Jack, he was transporting
his father's dead body

379
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,678
from Sydney to Los Angeles in a coffin.
Now that's gonna be John Locke.

380
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,670
- And your relation to the deceased?
- He was a friend.

381
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,961
This whole idea of, "Wow, history
seems to be repeating itself here."

382
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,017
I thought maybe you
might change your mind.

383
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,154
If there's even a chance that Jin
is alive, I have to be on that plane.

384
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,983
Kate was in handcuffs.
She was a prisoner.

385
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:17,559
This time around,
it's Sayid who is the prisoner.

386
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,608
Sayid has no desire
to go back to this island.

387
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:23,191
And he's drinking himself a very
expensive glass of scotch,

388
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:26,280
and he meets this very fetching and
beautiful woman who's sitting at the bar.

389
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,596
Things look sort of romantically
promising for Sayid,

390
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,669
and then boom--
He gets kicked in the face.

391
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,489
It works
for some people...

392
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,290
- just not-- Not for Sayid.
- Not for Sayid.

393
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,770
- I was hired to bring you to Guam.
- Who hired you?

394
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,818
The family of Peter Avellino,

395
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,174
the man you killed last year on
a golf course in the Seychelles.

396
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:48,345
Can I ask you a favor?
Can we get the next plane?

397
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,857
This is the plane we're taking.

398
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,858
Hurley, what are you doing here?

399
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:55,584
The last time we saw Hurley,
he was in prison...

400
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:57,553
I'm totally cool.
I'm in L.A. county lockup.

401
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,490
incarcerated for double murder. It turns
out these were people who Sayid killed.

402
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,520
But Benjamin Linus' lawyer
apparently got him off.

403
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,662
All that matters is
that I'm here, right?

404
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:10,366
So there are a lot emotional
circumstances surrounding the Ajira flight,

405
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:14,180
echoing back to the original pilot of the
show, even though it's three years later

406
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,380
and they've been through these
amazing adventures together.

407
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,247
- You made it.
- Yeah. I made it.

408
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,510
Wait! What's he doing here?!
He can't come!

409
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,290
- No one told me he was gonna be here.
- Who told you to be here, Hugo?

410
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,882
- Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
- Who's Benjamin Linus?

411
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,152
He's the monster responsible
for nothing short of genocide.

412
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:38,133
- Why would I work for somebody like that?
- I did.

413
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:39,300
Flight 316

414
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,293
Our guys get on flight 316.

415
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,910
They kind of have this sense that
they're gonna get back to the island.

416
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,415
You don't think it means something
that somehow we're all back together?

417
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:52,885
We're on the same plane, Jack.
Doesn't make us together.

418
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:56,523
What they don't expect is that they
hear an announcement over the intercom.

419
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:59,869
This is your captain, Frank
J. Lapidus. Welcome aboard.

420
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:03,050
Frank Lapidus was the helicopter
pilot that came on the freighter

421
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,880
and was ferrying the, uh, science
team to and from the island.

422
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,335
- Well, hello, doc.
- What are you doing here, Frank?

423
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:14,373
I fly this route all the time. Sometimes
I take the big birds into new... Delhi.

424
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:17,119
Is that Sayid?
And Hurley.

425
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,166
Wait a second.
We're not going to Guam, are we?

426
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,444
Lapidus is flying along and he
has a strong sense of foreboding.

427
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:29,055
- You all right there, Frank?
- I'm just fine.

428
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:31,683
And sure enough,
they're struck with turbulence.

429
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:35,118
Dude, you might wanna
fasten your seat belt.

430
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,550
They find themselves
flashing from night to day...

431
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,721
Mayday! Mayday!

432
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:46,651
And it's all Frank Lapidus can
do to safely land this airplane.

433
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,184
They land on the island,
and four of them have disappeared.

434
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:55,275
There's no Jack, there's no Kate,
there's no Hurley and there's no Sayid.

435
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,730
- Where'd they go?
- They're gone.

436
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,097
- Gone where?
- How would I know?

437
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:05,177
So the plane lands on the island in the
island present, but these four characters...

438
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,808
appear on the island
30 years earlier.

439
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:11,861
Help! Help!

440
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:16,607
- Kate.
- What happened?

441
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:21,711
Eloise Hawking has said that you have to
replicate the circumstances of 815 exactly.

442
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,726
- They were not able to do that.
- Where's the plane?

443
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:28,182
Which is what triggers
some of them to move to 1977.

444
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,396
Jin?

445
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:41,119
When John Locke stopped
the flashes on the island...

446
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,970
My nose isn't bleeding
anymore.

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,409
he saved the lives of his friends.

448
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,523
- Now we wait for him to come back.
- For how long?

449
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:50,352
As long as it takes.

450
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:54,377
Unfortunately, it strands
all of our characters in 1974.

451
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:58,060
The only people that are on this compound
are members of the Dharma Initiative.

452
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,146
The sub returns in two weeks.
Until then, you can stay.

453
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:05,065
Horace says we can wait
for the next sub.

454
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,777
With any luck,
Locke'll be back by then.

455
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,236
And then what?

456
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,494
When the Oceanic Six left
the island on the helicopter,

457
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,030
Sawyer was assuming that they
might return because Locke said,

458
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,239
"I'm gonna go get those
guys and bring 'em back."

459
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,002
- I'm going to leave.
- Just give me two weeks.

460
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:22,654
- That's all I'm asking.
- All right, two weeks.

461
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,686
Dharmaville

462
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:27,733
Somehow, two weeks
turned into three years.

463
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,756
Hey, welcome to the island, man.

464
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:35,764
Who wouldn't love living in the '70s?
The Dharma Initiative sort of have it all.

465
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:38,530
They're living on this beautiful island.
They go to barbecues.

466
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,227
They get to wear cool jumpsuits.
They listen to cool music.

467
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:47,536
And over the course of that time,
Sawyer finds himself in a leadership role.

468
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:50,890
Mr. Lafleur here can
fill you in on the situation.

469
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,066
- "Mr. Lafleur"?
- It's creole. Improvised.

470
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:57,547
- And he's really good at it.
- Mr. Lafleur, sorry to bother you.

471
00:23:57,577 --> 00:24:00,680
Here's a guy who was always sort of
an outsider and a bad boy and a rebel.

472
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,582
He is actually now the head of security of
the Dharma Initiative. He's well-respected.

473
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,225
Good man-- Lafleur.
Runs a very tight operation.

474
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:11,210
Sawyer's got, uh, a whole
security team that works for him,

475
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,209
most notably Jin and Miles. They happen
to have been assigned to security as well.

476
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,834
Evening, enos.

477
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:20,571
People like him.
He doesn't ruffle any feathers.

478
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,660
They have a truce with the others,

479
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,690
so the biggest issue that he's
dealing with is public drunkenness.

480
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:29,916
More significantly, Sawyer's begun
a romantic relationship with Juliet.

481
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:33,985
And they are cohabitating
and they have a wonderful life.

482
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,562
- What does that mean, living together?
- That means they're living together.

483
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:40,442
Then they are cohabitating.
At least until our characters return.

484
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,918
What?

485
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:45,468
What? No.
Don't bring 'em in.

486
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:47,460
Who was it?

487
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,730
Sawyer and Juliet get along great.
There's none of the sort of, uh,

488
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,486
emotional fireworks that
existed between he and Kate.

489
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:55,879
- Everything okay?
- I gotta go.

490
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,860
But now Kate's back, and as
soon as they see each other,

491
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,791
that chemistry just locks
in for both of them.

492
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:04,450
Dude, I can't believe it!

493
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,333
Easy on the ribs there, Kong.

494
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:10,077
And that throws a big wrench
in the mechanism, doesn't it?

495
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:10,958
Huge.

496
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:13,093
So what's up with you guys
in the old Dharma jumpsuits?

497
00:25:13,123 --> 00:25:15,166
We're in the Dharma Initiative.

498
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,041
It's 1977.

499
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,330
Uh... what?

500
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,958
All right, listen, y'all are gonna
be the second batch of recruits

501
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,623
coming in off the sub.

502
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:28,249
Sawyer kept the arrival
of his friends quiet

503
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,799
and brought them into the
Dharma Initiative as new recruits.

504
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,041
I never actually thought
they'd come back.

505
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:36,271
So they're back?
Nothing's changed.

506
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:38,688
Juliet gives a warning
that their life is over,

507
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:41,043
and Sawyer really doesn't
think that's gonna be the case.

508
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,659
And although Sawyer says,
"Juliet, I'm in love with you,"

509
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,836
Juliet also acknowledges that this
is the beginning of the end for them.

510
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:51,337
- Everybody say "Namaste."
- Namaste!

511
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,804
Sun comes back to the
island for one reason only,

512
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:58,884
and that is to find her husband Jin.
She goes back to Dharmaville.

513
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,270
Now it's all dusty and overgrown.

514
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,498
I don't think we're gonna
find your husband here.

515
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:07,012
She happens to find none
other than Christian Shephard.

516
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,175
- Where is my husband?
- He's with your friends.

517
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,602
I'm sorry, but you have a bit
of a journey ahead of you.

518
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,659
She doesn't know how she's going
to reunite with her husband,

519
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:20,110
who is also on the island, but is on
the island in a different period of time.

520
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,883
Hey, you understand
the concept of knocking?

521
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:26,183
Jin doesn't know where Sun is.
He doesn't know where the plane is.

522
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:30,663
- Can you check with the other stations?
- I just told you. I would not--

523
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:33,401
Check with the other stations.

524
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:37,150
So he's very invested in any way
that he can get back to Sun.

525
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,830
Where did you get this?
Who gave this to you?

526
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,868
He said his name was Christian.

527
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:45,143
He said if I ever wanted to see my husband
again, I had to wait here for John Locke.

528
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,622
But considering he's dead,
we ain't holding our breath.

529
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,060
Well, you might want
to look outside.

530
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,670
Locke is alive

531
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,230
John Locke is very much alive again, and
that's sort of one of the big revelations,

532
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,493
particularly for Ben,
who actually killed John Locke.

533
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:00,813
My god.

534
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,812
And Ben is incredibly surprised.
Like, what does it mean that he is alive?

535
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:09,597
Because it's one thing to believe it, John.
It's another thing to see it.

536
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,980
And that is a question the audience
has rightfully been asking--

537
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,330
What does it mean
that John Locke is alive?

538
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,379
Locke was dead.
He rembers being killed by Ben.

539
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,706
- I remember dying.
- And that's it.

540
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:23,206
Now he's back on the island.
The island's given him life again.

541
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:25,530
The first time he came to the island,
he was in a wheelchair,

542
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,487
and then he could walk.
This is now that times a thousand.

543
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:32,065
So he really feels like he has this
incredible sense of purpose and destiny.

544
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:35,825
Well, Ben, I was hoping that you and I
could talk about the elephant in the room.

545
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,610
I assume you're referring to
the fact that I killed you.

546
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,650
Yeah.

547
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,830
Because it was in the best
interests of the island.

548
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:45,785
I was just hoping for an apology.

549
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:47,595
So having come
through this experience,

550
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,667
there is a tremendous amount
of faith and confidence.

551
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:52,485
What he's up to,
we don't know.

552
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:55,715
Locke is a mystery again,
like he was when we first met him.

553
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:57,369
How is it that you know
where you're going?

554
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:00,566
And that's kind of a very
exciting place for him to be.

555
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,480
I just know.

556
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,776
John Locke seems to have a far superior
sense of communication with the island,

557
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:08,568
and this really makes
Benjamin Linus very upset.

558
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:10,440
I've seen this island
do miraculous things,

559
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,056
but never once has it done
anything like this.

560
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:16,736
So the fact that John Locke is
walking around this island...

561
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,700
scares the living hell out of me.

562
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:27,997
For Hurley, the '70s were a chance
to make the world a better place.

563
00:28:28,027 --> 00:28:29,460
I made lunch for the crew.

564
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,580
- You're waiting for the next van.
- Why don't we carpool?

565
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,981
It'll help with global warming,
which hasn't happened yet.

566
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,711
So maybe we can prevent it.

567
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,040
Hurley is really going with
the flow here in Dharma times.

568
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,972
When he first arrives, he's very
confused about time travel...

569
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,768
Okay, answer me this.

570
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,168
which we think makes him a lot like
the people who are watching the show.

571
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:51,333
If all this already happened to me,
why don't I remember any of it?

572
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,320
Because our experiences
in the past and the future

573
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,333
occurred before
these experiences right now.

574
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:00,517
Say that again.

575
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:02,280
But once he sort of gets
into the groove of things,

576
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,218
he becomes a Dharma chef.
He starts cooking.

577
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:07,365
Don't forget to try the dipping sauces.
They really bring out the ham.

578
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:08,952
And he's working on
a side project,

579
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,052
which is that he's writing
"the empire strikes back."

580
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,308
George Lucas is gonna
be looking for a sequel,

581
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:16,753
so I figured, make life easier
and send him the script...

582
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:18,109
with a couple improvements.

583
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:20,620
And there's this big mystery
hovering over Hurley, which is,

584
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,906
why did he come back to the island?
How did he know about Ajira flight 316?

585
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:27,983
What's up with that guitar case?
What is his mission really?

586
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:29,270
4, 8...

587
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,134
...15, 16...

588
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,068
...23...

589
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,795
The fact that the numbers brought him
here, that he may have been cursed.

590
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,790
Oh, hold on a minute.
It's smudged.

591
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,676
- 42.
- 42!

592
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:41,902
- How the hell did you know that?
- They're building our hatch.

593
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:43,680
And Hurley becomes
friends with Miles,

594
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:49,180
and he discovers that Miles is
actually the son of Pierre Chang,

595
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,039
who is the star of these
Dharma orientation films.

596
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,384
Third day we were here,
I was on line at the cafeteria,

597
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:58,112
and my mother got in line behind me.
That was my first clue.

598
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:02,390
And Hurley sort of takes it upon himself
to get these two characters back together.

599
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,870
We should all get together for a beer
sometime. How awesome would that be?

600
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,592
- As Hurley made new friends...
- We got a hostile inside the perimeter.

601
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:13,972
another Ajira passenger
had a far different experience.

602
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:20,400
Unlike the other characters who jumped
back into 1977, Sayid is separated,

603
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,079
and he is not able to get indoctrinated
into the Dharma Initiative.

604
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:26,358
- Sayid?
- Jin.

605
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,783
Shut up!

606
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:31,062
He's out in the jungle and is
captured by the Dharma Initiative.

607
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:32,693
I'm sorry, Sayid.

608
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:36,315
He meets this young kid
who comes to bring him food...

609
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,558
I'm Ben.

610
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,968
none other
than Benjamin Linus.

611
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,182
How you doing?

612
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:44,599
A 12-year-old Ben Linus brought
me a chicken salad sandwich.

613
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:47,579
- How do you think I'm doing?
- Sweet kid, huh?

614
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:49,270
There are two fundamental ways
to look at time travel--

615
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,594
You can change the future,
or you can't change the future.

616
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:55,210
And Sayid, all of a sudden, a lightbulb
goes off in his head and he says,

617
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,227
"I know now why I came
back to this island."

618
00:30:58,347 --> 00:30:59,834
I think I can help you.

619
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:01,630
He thinks that,
if I kill Benjamin Linus,

620
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,939
just like if someone
were to kill young Hitler,

621
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:07,780
that person won't grow up to be
the bad guy that they grew up to be,

622
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,864
- and that he can change things.
- I really hate it here.

623
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:15,144
He wins young Ben's confidence.
He gets young Ben to help him escape.

624
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,258
Sayid repays him by shooting Ben.

625
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,920
Which leads one to believe that this
is where Ben's trust issues were born.

626
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,480
Doc, I need you to come with me.
The kid's losing blood.

627
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,160
We need you to show us
where he sprung a leak.

628
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,552
No.

629
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:33,877
If you don't come with me,
Jack, that kid's gonna die.

630
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:35,367
Then he dies.

631
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,830
Jack seems very willing to sort
of let fate and destiny guide him,

632
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,816
in a way,
and not be willful anymore.

633
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:44,680
He's just a boy, Jack.
You can't just let him die.

634
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,390
When we were here before, I spent
all of my time trying to fix things.

635
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,065
But did you ever think that maybe the
island just wants to fix things itself?

636
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:57,357
Jack has become this man of faith,
and he has this sort of zen-like quality.

637
00:31:57,387 --> 00:32:01,610
- I liked the old you.
- You didn't like the old me, Kate.

638
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,570
- We can't just sit here and do nothing.
- Maybe there's something they can do.

639
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,997
The others.

640
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,526
And lo and behold,
Kate saves Ben.

641
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:13,171
If I take him, he's not ever
gonna be the same again.

642
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:16,970
He will always be one of us.
You still want me to take him?

643
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,521
Yes.

644
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:21,953
So Ben ends up living
and becoming Ben.

645
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,925
Ben, I'd appreciate
it if you joined us.

646
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:26,532
What, John, don't you trust
me here with my former people?

647
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:27,992
Afraid I'll stage a coup?

648
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:30,907
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, Ben.

649
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:32,280
Now that Locke's
back on the island,

650
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,708
he's got an agenda to go
and find Alpert and the others.

651
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,586
- I brought dinner.
- John?

652
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,180
Who's that man he's talking to?

653
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,312
He's a kind of advisor.
His name is Richard Alpert.

654
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:47,900
Richard Alpert is
a very interesting character.

655
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,032
It's clear that he's been on this island
for a long time, and he doesn't age.

656
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:54,692
You do remember birthdays,
don't you, Richard?

657
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,970
And one of the most important
things about Alpert right now

658
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,702
is he's the only character on
the show who's in both times.

659
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:03,209
He's in 1977.
He's also in 2007.

660
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:07,016
- I am the leader now.
- Yes, John, that's right.

661
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:10,288
Good, then I would like you
to take me to Jacob.

662
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:15,549
- We all answer to someone, John.
- And whom might that be?

663
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,003
His name is Jacob.

664
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,960
There is this larger
spiritual presence

665
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,161
that the people on the
island refer to as Jacob.

666
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:26,176
- Jacob wanted it done.
- Jacob talks to me, John.

667
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:29,627
We've seen apparitions
that may or may not be Jacob.

668
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:30,759
That was Jacob.

669
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,406
If we've met Jacob,
we haven't been told that.

670
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:35,783
- Are you Jacob?
- I'm Christian.

671
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:38,277
When we met Christian Shephard,
for example, in the cabin,

672
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,480
he says, "I'm speaking
on behalf of Jacob."

673
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,892
No one else has ever seen him.

674
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:45,028
- That's right.
- How convenient.

675
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,122
For some time, you all have been
accepting orders from a man named Jacob.

676
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,320
And John Locke says, "I'm very curious
about a lot of things on this island

677
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,062
and why Jacob is asking us to do
the things that we've been doing."

678
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,749
"And once we have
that conversation,

679
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:59,404
I think I'll be able to lead
you a lot more effectively."

680
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:04,034
So I'm gonna go and see Jacob, and
I'd like all of you to come with me.

681
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,920
I'm starting to think
John Locke is gonna be trouble.

682
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,620
Why do you think
I tried to kill him?

683
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,127
I'm here to follow you now,

684
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:15,650
so if you need Jacob to help you reunite
your people, then I'll do whatever--

685
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,930
I'm not interested in being
reuniting with my people.

686
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,173
Then why are we going to Jacob?

687
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,659
So I can kill him.

688
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:29,379
- Hey, can I get a hand with this?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

689
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,345
After a 3-year absence, Daniel
Faraday returned to the island in 1977.

690
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,784
- Dan.
- Hey, Miles.

691
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:38,839
Long time, no see.

692
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:42,780
Daniel Faraday is
an expert in physics.

693
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,820
Particularly in the field of quantum
physics, and he knows about time travel.

694
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,949
And he leaves the island and he
goes to Ann Arbor, Michigan,

695
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:52,533
joins the Dharma Initiative,
and he goes over all of his life's work.

696
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:53,825
Right on time.

697
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:58,603
Faraday is convinced that he actually
now has a significant mission to perform.

698
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,950
The orchid station
was under construction

699
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,530
and becoming a dangerous endeavor
for the Dharma Initiative.

700
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,860
The same thing is gonna happen
at the site for the swan station,

701
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,841
and the accident...
is gonna be catastrophic.

702
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:14,784
What could possibly qualify you
to make that kind of prediction?

703
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:17,354
I'm from the future.

704
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:20,504
For most of the season,
Daniel Faraday basically said,

705
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:23,076
"If you try to change the past,
it's not gonna work out,"

706
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,405
except now Faraday appears
to have changed his mind.

707
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:28,622
I finally realized...
People.

708
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:31,907
We think, we reason,
we have free will.

709
00:35:31,937 --> 00:35:34,336
We can change our destiny.

710
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:37,680
And he's determined that,
yes, you can change the future

711
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,904
if you do something
really significant.

712
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:42,450
And he says,
"The way that I can do that

713
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,930
is to prevent the hatch
from ever having been built."

714
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,200
The Dharma folks at the swan
work site-- They're gonna--

715
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,430
They're gonna
drill into the ground

716
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,340
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

717
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,570
In order to contain it, they're gonna have
to cement the entire area in like Chernobyl.

718
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,460
They're going to spend the next
20 years keeping that energy at bay

719
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,840
by pressing a button--

720
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,004
A button that your friend
Desmond will one day fail to push,

721
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:09,633
and that will cause your
plane to crash on this island.

722
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:13,757
All this is about Faraday pushing
the reset button in a huge way.

723
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:18,078
I think we can change that.
And that hatch will never be built,

724
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:21,692
and your plane will land
just like it's supposed to.

725
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:25,369
And just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

726
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,324
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

727
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,151
- Hey, James.
- Welcome to the meeting, twitchy.

728
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,366
So he walked into Sawyer's house and
he addresses everybody and he says,

729
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:38,277
"I have a way to get us all
back to where we belong."

730
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:41,266
Does anyone know where
I can find the hostiles?

731
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:45,061
- Why do you need to know that, Daniel?
- Because one of them is my mother.

732
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:47,513
Your mother is an other?

733
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:50,250
You met her back in 1954.
They were calling her Ellie.

734
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,920
This character Eloise Hawking--
She is Daniel Faraday's mother.

735
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,175
Where is Eloise?

736
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:59,710
But now in 1977, Faraday's
mother is now 20 years older

737
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,304
- and encounters Faraday again.
- She's not here right now.

738
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:05,730
The hydrogen bomb I told your
people to bury-- Where is it?

739
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,485
Just put the gun down.

740
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:13,241
- Faraday has the misfortune of dying.
- Right, yes. He gets shot by his mom.

741
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:17,770
- Who are you?
- I'm your son.

742
00:37:19,392 --> 00:37:21,104
We have to go, Jack.
We have to go right now.

743
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:23,884
Jack and Kate are
captured by the others.

744
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,880
And Eloise Hawking has, like,
a new motivation herself, right?

745
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,330
Because she's hoping that
you can change the future

746
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,258
because she would certainly very
much like not to have her son die.

747
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:38,146
How is this my handwriting
if I don't rember writing it?

748
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,767
Because you haven't
written it yet.

749
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:44,182
And Jack finally realizes,
"This is why I'm in 1977."

750
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:47,635
What you just did,
it was an accident,

751
00:37:47,755 --> 00:37:51,555
and I think that there's a way
for you to take it all back.

752
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,501
"My destiny is to prevent myself from ever
having come to this island in the first place."

753
00:37:56,531 --> 00:38:01,330
Your son came back here because he
had figured out a way to change things.

754
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,891
He doesn't have to be dead.
You don't have to have killed him.

755
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:08,621
- Does he know what he's talking about?
- He thinks he does.

756
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,877
All right, then...
I'll take you to the bomb.

757
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:17,204
- You two know how to swim?
- Why don't we just go around it?

758
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:20,374
We have to swim under the
pond to get to the tunnel.

759
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:21,876
I'm not going.

760
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:24,286
I can't go any further with
you, Jack, not this time.

761
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:25,631
Kate...

762
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:28,010
Jack makes her very
uneasy and uncomfortable

763
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,894
because he's really undergone an
incredible transformation as a character.

764
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:35,131
And if you're wrong,
then everyone on the island dies.

765
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:37,967
- Do you understand that?
- I'm not wrong, Kate. This is it.

766
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:41,350
- This is our destiny.
- Do you know who you sound like?

767
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,622
Because he was crazy, too, Jack.
You said so yourself.

768
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:46,410
I'm going back to find
the rest of our people,

769
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,790
because if I can't stop you,
then maybe they can.

770
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:52,110
Kate made her way back
to the compound,

771
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,040
where Sawyer and Juliet
were planning an escape.

772
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,556
You called it the minute
those yahoos got there.

773
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,157
I should've listened to you.

774
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:01,404
Fairly quickly,
everything unravels.

775
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:06,300
One of Sawyer's trusty security guys
finds this videotape with evidence

776
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,580
that Sawyer is not who he says he is,
and, of course, all the Dharma people

777
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,431
are shocked because Sawyer was
the very beloved head of security.

778
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:15,418
That's not good, right?

779
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:19,004
That woman--
Where is she now?

780
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:21,980
They beat the crap out of him
trying to find out what he knows

781
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,051
and where young Ben is.

782
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:25,469
They got Sawyer and Juliet.

783
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:27,630
And there are 30 of them
and they all have guns.

784
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,660
We gotta do something. I mean,
Sawyer would never leave us behind.

785
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:35,070
Dr. Chang.

786
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,726
Your friend Faraday said
that you were from the future.

787
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,020
- Dude, that's ridiculous.
- What year were you born?

788
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,517
- Uh... 1931.
- You're 46?

789
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:48,437
Who's the president
of the United States?

790
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:51,238
All right, dude,
we're from the future. Sorry.

791
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:53,073
Your friend, the physicist--

792
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:57,670
He said there was going to be a massive
accident at the swan. Now is that true?

793
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,522
He's been right
about everything so far.

794
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:01,780
We need to evacuate the island
of all nonessential personnel,

795
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,270
and you need to do it...
What the hell is going on here?

796
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,350
Aren't you supposed to be
at the swan right now, Chang?

797
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,450
We're supposed to break ground
in less than 20 hours.

798
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
If we start drilling,
there's a high probability

799
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,364
- of a cataclysmic accident.
- We are drilling and on schedule!

800
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:19,910
He's right. It ain't safe.

801
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,587
Put the women and children on the
sub and get 'em the hell out of here.

802
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:25,865
Sawyer makes a deal
with them and says,

803
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:29,927
"I will give you the information you want
as long as you put me on the submarine."

804
00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:34,165
He's content, at this point, to just
sail off to the real world with Juliet.

805
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:37,804
Once we dock, wherever we dock,
we're free.

806
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:42,257
- I love you.
- I love you back.

807
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:44,192
Hold on!
Don't close the hatch!

808
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:47,888
- But then, unfortunately...
- Kate gets tossed in the mix.

809
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:49,108
Oh, Kate.

810
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,652
- Hey.
- Hey.

811
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:54,570
Apparently, she's come back to try
to warn them about what Jack's up to,

812
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,648
but she's now captured
by the Dharma Initiative.

813
00:40:56,678 --> 00:41:00,168
So now you've got those three
characters sailing away from the island,

814
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:04,165
and Jack back on the island,
on his way to a hydrogen bomb.

815
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,908
There are crazy things
happening on this island.

816
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:08,994
There is a sense
of destiny and purpose.

817
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:13,474
But all of that is secondary to the fact
that these people are here for a reason.

818
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,600
These characters are
intertwined in ways

819
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,540
that they don't even fully
realize and understand yet.

820
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,595
The relationships they form,
the friendships--

821
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,414
Who's gonna live?
Who's gonna die?

822
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:24,833
Those are the really exciting
stories that we wanna tell,

823
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:28,879
starting in this finale and rolling
into the final season of the show.

824
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:31,290
We've been excited for a long
time about where the show is going,

825
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,802
and now we finally get to share the
rest of that journey with the audience.

826
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:38,770
We think the best part of the story is
still yet to be told in this final season,

827
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,750
and we hope people
will enjoy the ride with us.

828
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,960
Well... now what?

829
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,768
