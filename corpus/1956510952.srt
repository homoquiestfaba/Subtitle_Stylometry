- He'll send it when he's ready.
- Christ's sake!

184
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:28,766
I'm demandin' it
first thing in the mornin'.

185
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,725
No, you can't order him
to do anything. It won't work.

186
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:34,057
He owes you your ticket, Clare.

187
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,266
You've served your time
and then some.

188
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,057
- What's that mark?
- What?

189
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:44,350
- There's another on your neck.
- I fell.

190
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:48,641
Did he hurt you?

191
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,100
I'll kill him if he hurt you!

192
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,682
Stop it will you, you fool.

193
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,391
I fell and hit my head
on the stove.

194
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:02,933
We're leavin' tonight.

195
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:03,850
No.

196
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:05,932
We can go somewhere
no one'll find us.

197
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,891
We have a few coins saved,
we'll work it out.

198
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,182
Aidan...

199
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,475
if I got caught
without a ticket

200
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,350
I'd be sent straight back
to that prison

201
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:13,765
and I'd lose you both.

202
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:15,725
I cannot do that.

203
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:17,557
It'd kill me.

204
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,683
He's heading up north soon...

205
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:26,808
we'll have to follow.

206
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:28,475
Do you want that?

207
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you want to be chained
to him forever Clare?

208
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:40,515
I'm meant to be looking
after you now.

209
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,182
I'll ask him myself tomorrow.

210
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,391
I promise...

211
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,182
I won't lose my temper.

212
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:53,975
I'll be the nicest,
most politest man...

213
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,600
who ever lived.

214
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,807
Alright?

215
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,182
Alright, me missus?

216
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,475
I love you Clare Carroll.

217
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,182
You're my life.

218
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:11,140

[laughter]

222
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,765
What are you made of? Come on.

223
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,933
- I can't, sergeant.
- Drink. Drink. Drink.

224
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,975
Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink.

225
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:05,058
Don't waste it, son.

226
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:15,808
Salutations, lieutenant.
You've done well.

227
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,515
Not long now,
we'll be calling you captain.

228
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,433
What a bloody rigmarole.

229
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,850
Won't be bendin' over for the
likes of him when I'm captain.

230
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,015
[gasps]

231
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,725
What? Give me a slice, sir!

232
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,933
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm so... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

233
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,932
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I've had too much.

234
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,515
[laughter]

235
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,808
You've had five soldiers flogged

236
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,640
and in the clink already,
sergeant.

237
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,683
Do you want the rest of them
in there?

238
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:45,183
Get to bed, you tosspots!

239
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,682
Don't drain the dregs.
Just get!

240
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,475
[clamoring]

241
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,558
[indistinct singing]

242
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,850
- Have you been drinking?
- I'm just gonna talk to him.

243
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,225
No!

244
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,058
[indistinct chatter]

245
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,515
Let her go.

246
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
- Beg yours?
- I asked you nice this mornin'.

247
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:29,016
Now I'm tellin' you.
Let her go.

248
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,183
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Watch your mouth.

249
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:32,850
Well, let him speak.

250
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,850
She's been askin'
for three months.

251
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,350
Every week you say
you're gonna send the letter

252
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,683
and every week you don't.

253
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,682
Why won't you let her go?

254
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,057
Aidan, please. Aidan.

255
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,640
She's paid her dues
and so have I.

256
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,350
Is that right?

257
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:54,390
She's my wife.

258
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,975
And she's my property

259
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:58,766
so I'll do what I want with her.

260
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,475
[laughing]

261
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:04,725
Please, love.
Just walk away now.

262
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,390
No!

263
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,475
[grunts]

264
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,475
[grunts]

265
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:22,475
[groans]

266
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,808
In your office, lieutenant.

267
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,266
What the hell were you thinking,
fightin' an officer?

268
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,265
Do you wanna ruin us?

269
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,558
He's a troublemaker, sir,
he and his wife.

270
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,765
And what is she to you?

271
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,140
Nothin', captain.

272
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,057
Do you think I'm an idiot?

273
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,890
No.

274
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,015
The lieutenant governor
finds moral indiscretion

275
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,600
in his officers abhorrent.

276
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,141
I agree.

277
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,350
I don't tolerate
any indiscretions.

278
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:11,100
I've spent enough time here now.

279
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,308
Noted your conduct
and that of your soldiers.

280
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,975
I'm afraid I can't recommend you
for the captaincy up north.

281
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:21,765
But I was told by the
lieutenant colonel himself

282
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,433
that he would put me forward
to Major Bexley.

283
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,640
Pending my recommendation.

284
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,640
And I'm afraid
I can't recommend you.

285
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:30,600
Sir, I took on this post

286
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:33,141
with the promise
it would be one year.

287
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,975
Three years later,
I'm still here.

288
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:38,141
I've been handed
the sorriest band of soldiers

289
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,850
that ever sullied
the British Army

290
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,141
and still
I've had consistent results.

291
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,475
I've civilized the land

292
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,475
got rid of the blacks,
made it safe...

293
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,183
No one owes you anything,
lieutenant!

294
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,850
There is no officer
in this colony

295
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,266
who's put in more work than me,
no one who knows it better.

296
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,808
If an officer can't even control

297
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,515
the convict detritus
that surrounds him

298
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,390
how on earth could he command
a bigger post up north?

299
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,182
I've a long trip back.

300
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,850
I'll travel north to Launceston,
see Major Bexley meself

301
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,433
and apply for the position
in person.

302
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,225
If you insist.

303
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:13,600
The post will be filled
in four to five days, I'd say.

304
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,058
Four to five days?

305
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,350
Well, no other officer knows
the colony better than you.

306
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:21,016
Why don't you take your nag
and ride up?

307
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,850
It's nigh on impossible to get
a horse up that way from here.

308
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,850
Then take some men and walk it.

309
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:32,557
Fuck!

310
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,140
Fuck!

311
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:44,307
We're headed up north
to Launceston first thing

312
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,057
through the interior.

313
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,475
[scoffs]
What?

314
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:49,225
Isn't that dangerous?

315
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:53,225
Yes, it's fucking dangerous,
you fat-headed lobcock!

316
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:55,641
But we're not ready yet, sir.

317
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:57,475
I haven't handed things over
to the corporal.

318
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:00,725
We don't have any supplies,
no black tracker.

319
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:03,391
Then get us ready, Ruse.

320
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,390
Do something useful for once.

321
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,640
Drink up. We're paying a visit.

322
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,975
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

323
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,100
What else?

324
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,558
I lose my ticket,

325
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,225
go back to the pen,

326
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:24,308
and you're left
alone with him?

327
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:26,933
I'd rather us face the wild,

328
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,640
take our chances.

329
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,225
It's freezing for her out there.

330
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:35,475
You remember how to pack this?

331
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:38,725
Where will we go?

332
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,100
Doesn't matter.
Away from here.

333
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,141
Let me feed her first.

334
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:46,640
She's starving.

335
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,140
Alright, quickly.

336
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58,141
Shh, shh.

337
00:23:58,225 --> 00:23:59,808

339
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,808
Shh.

340
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,182
Going somewhere?

341
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,475
We don't want no trouble.

342
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,558
That's just the way, isn't it?

343
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,225
You don't want trouble, but
sometimes trouble wants you.

344
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,350
- We're very sorry.
- Not you!

345
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,808
[baby crying]

346
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,975
Him.

347
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,350
Apologize.

348
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:46,058
I'm sorry.

349
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:51,475
No!

350
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,475
[baby wailing]

351
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,975
No!

352
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:04,766
Aidan, no!

[baby wailing]

354
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:13,807
What, are you gonna shoot me
now, you Irish cunt?

355
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,807
You're nothing
but the shit on my shoe.

356
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,765
He's drunk, sir. He's very sorry
for what he did. We both are.

357
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:28,100
She's a beauty, your wife.

358
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,975
I've enjoyed her greatly.

359
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,725
[laughs]

360
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:37,100

She begged me for it.

Says I'm the best
she's ever had.

368

It's a fucking wilderness.

At least take a guide,
for God's sake.

There's a guide
that I work with.

I told them to bugger off.

Uncle Charlie go with them

00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,891
I'm not helping
you white bastards no more.

515

You don't have two shillin'.

I'll cash this jewelry
for the rest.

522
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:29,058
If you kill me
before the job's done

523
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:31,391
you won't find anyone
who'll take these for coin.

524
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:33,890
So don't even think about it.

525

- I don't have no baby.

- Do you want the job or not?

00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,683
You get me to my husband,
then take us both to Launceston.

You take me now
or I'll find someone who will.

You're not taking that horse

- Then I'm taking the dogs.

538
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:11,516
No dogs!

539
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:22,308
Bloody dangerous

540
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,350
- Blow your head off.
- You need to move.

00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,183
Move, boy!

542
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,933
Wait, will ya? Wait!

543
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:44,516
Go the wrong way, if you want.
Them soldiers went this way.

544
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:14,975
- What's with that face, ensign?
- Sorry, lieutenant?

545
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:17,516
You've been looking like
a scared little girl all day.

546
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,516
- Drop it.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,933
Move, ya cunts!

548
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,350
Good choice, Ruse. A skeleton,
a simpleton and a midget.

549
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:34,600
- Well done.
- I had no choice, sir.

550
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:36,850
All the other convicts
are off finishing the bridge.

551
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,516
- We'd be faster without 'em.
- All respect, sir.

552
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,766
I can shine your boots,
make a fire, fetch your water

553
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,350
and run faster and work harder
than them old farts.

554
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,016
It appears the midget
has some balls, lieutenant.

555
00:36:56,891 --> 00:36:58,808
[baby crying]

556
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,641
[gunshot]

557
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:25,683
There they go! Did you see?

558
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,600
- That's my black.
- What do you mean yours?

559
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:29,641
He's my guide, you fool!

560
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,433
Are you soft in the head?

561
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,975
You're traveling alone
with that?

562
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:34,808
I've lost him now,
thanks to you.

563
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,100
Them savages lit that fire.

564
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:38,558
They killed our sheep.

565
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,058
They would have killed the wife
and young'uns, too

566
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,308
if we didn't come home early.

567
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,475
Oh. Are you mad, woman?

568
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:46,350
You cannot go out there
on your own!

569
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,350
There's a war on, you know.

570
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,183
Aye, well, your funeral!

571
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:00,433

Jesus Christ Almighty!

574
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,725
Don't sneak up on me like that.

575
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:28,350
What you gonna do?
Shoot me or hang me?

576
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,308
Our people cleared that land

577
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:34,350
so we could hunt, get food.

578
00:38:34,433 --> 00:38:35,641
Be quiet, boy.

579
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:38,308
Then you white devils
come put sheeps on it.

580
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:40,308
Told us to get off our land.

581
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,975
Now we got no food.
You kill us.

582
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,641
I heard enough.

583
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,391
Damn you.

584
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:51,058
You get what you deserve.

585
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:58,100
Where's the food?
I'm starvin'.

586
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:03,975
It must have fallen off.

587
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,850
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us food.

588
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,516
What? Stealin' it?

589
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,183
- Boy!
- Yes, I'm stealin' it.

590
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,683
You go anywhere near that house
and I'll leave you here.

591
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:21,558
How are we gonna eat?

592
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:27,141
Maybe we can eat
that bloody horse.

593
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,183
Why are you black, boy?

594
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,516
You sick?

595
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,641
[laughs]

596
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,225
Leave him be, sergeant.

597
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:47,433
Charlie's a good boy.
Aren't you, Charlie?

598
00:39:49,808 --> 00:39:51,725
Three more days
till we're up north.

599
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,933
Watch out.
He'll get you in your sleep.

600
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:00,225
They eat little ones like you.

601
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,225
Ah!

602
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:08,475
[laughs]

603
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,391
Leave him alone.

604
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:14,475
He's just a boy.

605
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:17,308
Says he, the great protector
of children.

606
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:19,766
What'd you say?

607
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,683
Just makin' light, sir.
Just makin' light.

608
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,433
What's wrong, ensign?

609
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:32,641
Just thinkin'
of what happened, sir.

610
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,016
What we did.

611
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,516
What?

612
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,183
Some Irish convict scum
trying to kill an officer.

613
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:43,850
He went for me with his musket.

614
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,600
The world will thank us for it.

615
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:49,558
The girl didn't die, sir.

616
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,766
- I'm sure of it.
- So?

617
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,183
Even if she didn't, who's gonna
do anything about it?

618
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:58,558
For all anyone knows

619
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:01,058
her husband killed the baby
in a rage.

620
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:03,725
Then he set upon her,
so she shot him.

621
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:07,100
Don't worry yourself, lad.

622
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:11,100
We could hang for it, sir.

623
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:14,475
This is the last time
you'll mention it, ensign

624
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:16,266
to anyone.

625
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,350
You were never there.
You don't know what happened.

626
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,600
And when I look
at your stupid face

627
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,308
from this point on

628
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:25,975
I wanna see
a permanent fucking smile.

629
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,016
Alright?

630
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:33,433
Look on the bright side, sir.

631
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:35,558
Two months in Van Diemen's Land

632
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,725
and you're already
a baby killer.

633
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Hey.

634
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:47,683
Hey!

635
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:49,558
Hey!

636
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,766
If either of you do anything
to jeopardize this post for me

637
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,766

in the fucking bush to rot!

651
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,391
They went that way,
five of them.

00:44:48,475 --> 00:44:50,933
- Five?
- And a little one.

653

They go fast. Hardly no stop.

How long till we reach them?

657
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:02,350
Maybe catch 'em up tomorrow.
I don't know.

658
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,391
Well, can't we go a quicker way?

659
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,433
That way quicker way,
catch 'em up today.

Ah, get them off!

That's pipina.
They love you, them ones.

I'm a free married woman.

lets a woman travel out here

683

You stay here a while, there'll
be a decent coin in it for ya.

I wouldn't touch you
if my life depended on it.

Then show me your papers,
you Irish cunt.

00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:24,433
I was takin' a piss
and she was right there.

722
00:49:24,516 --> 00:49:26,516
What in the hell are you doing
bringing one here?

723
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,016
Where there's one,
there's ten, sergeant.

724
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,350
She was with a bunch
of dead ones.

725
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:32,975
She was just cryin' like this.
I swear they were all dead.

726
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:35,141
This was the only live one.

727
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:37,183
I just wanna try one, sir.
Just once.

728
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,975
- No.
- You've swived them before.

729
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,141
- Why can't I?
- Don't be disgusting.

730
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,391
Pack up!

731
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,850
[whimpers]

732
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,475
Get rid of her.

00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:52,016
[screams]

734
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,641
I done plenty of things
for you, sir.

735
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,641
This is the least
you could do for me.

736
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:00,141
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

737
00:50:00,225 --> 00:50:01,266
I... I was just..

738
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,100
You can swive her first, sir.
I don't mind.

739
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:08,558
She's a beauty.
Look at her, sir.

740
00:50:10,058 --> 00:50:11,350
This was the only live one.

741
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:13,016
Please let me go.

742
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,766
It's alright. It's alright.

743
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,225
It's alright. It's alright.

744
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,808
My baby!

745
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:21,725
He's on his own!

746
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:23,641
Shh, shh, shh.

747
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:24,641
My baby boy!

748
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:26,350
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

749
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:36,016
Tie her up to the cart.

750
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,016
Any problems,
that's the end of it.

751
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:42,433
[screaming]

752
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:43,766
Let me go!

753
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:45,100
No!

754
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,391
Let me go, you devil!

755
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,058
Shut it!

756
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,350
- They close.
- How close?

757
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:07,808
Get to 'em today
if the river not too high.

758
00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:10,975
Hear that river?

[water gushing]

760
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,100
- Close.
- Please can we hurry?

761
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,183
Please.

762
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:32,350
What are you doing?

763
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:35,600
River too high.
Get to 'em another day.

764
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:38,266
- You said we would make it.
- I'm not the boss.

765
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,058
- River the boss.
- Jesus Mary!

766
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,766
What are you doing?

767
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:47,058
We're not going across.

768
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:48,891
- We're going across.
- No.

769
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,016
River too high, too fast.

770
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,475
No!

771
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:54,100
Come on, Becky.

772
00:51:54,183 --> 00:51:55,725

795
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,016
Plenty of food out here

796
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:35,100
But I need time.

797
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:37,641
I can make spear to hunt.

798
00:54:37,725 --> 00:54:39,600
Why don't you go
and do it now then?

799
00:54:39,683 --> 00:54:41,808
Stop whinging about it.

800
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:44,600
You bloody white people.

801
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:46,808
Take me from my family.

802
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:49,100
Say, "You'll be like
white boy now.

803
00:54:49,183 --> 00:54:51,683
"You don't hunt.
Don't do ceremony.

804
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:54,266
That's bad way.
You do it whitefella way."

805
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,766
Whitefella way is shit way.

806
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,016
- Now I got nothing.
- Poor you.

807
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,100
No. Not poor me.
Bastard England.

808
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:05,766
You think you're the only one
with problems?

809
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,641
I've looked after meself

00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,475
Never knew me father.

811
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:13,100
Me mother worked herself
to an early grave.

812
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:16,308
I lived on the streets,
stole what I could to survive.

813
00:55:16,391 --> 00:55:19,266
And now I'm here at the arse end
of the world with you.

814
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,475
Welcome to the world, boy.

815
00:55:23,558 --> 00:55:25,350
Full of misery
from top to bottom.

816
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:27,433
I'm not your boy.

817
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,516
I'm mangana, the blackbird.

00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,516

821

Flying high over the mountains

823
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,141

I am Mangana

825
00:55:47,183 --> 00:55:48,016
Flying high over the mountains

Stop it!

827
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:52,308
Sounds bloody awful.

828
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:01,391
My brothers, my father,
my uncles..

829
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
...all them dead.

830
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:07,683
Them whitefella shot 'em all
in front of me when I was a kid.

831
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,683
My mother, my aunties..

832
00:56:12,766 --> 00:56:15,183
...all them run away.

833
00:56:15,266 --> 00:56:17,933
Never seen 'em again.

834
00:56:18,016 --> 00:56:21,475
Them whitefella take me
far from my family.

835
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:23,808
Chain me, beat me.

836
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:27,558
Say, "You be like
white boy now."

837
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,266
I don't never wanna be
like white boy.

838
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,475
Not now, not ever.

839
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:41,558
That big boss you following,
he's the worst one.

840
00:56:41,641 --> 00:56:42,933
He make me take him
to blackfella

841
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:44,975
then he shoot the blackfella.

842
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:49,475
I'm not working for no bloody
whitefella no more.

843
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,391
I'm gonna go up north.

844
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,641
I'm gonna find my mother,
my aunties.

845
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:59,183
Go back home to my country

846
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:01,433
so you can't hurt me no more.

847
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:03,016
What do you mean me?

848
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,183
I didn't hurt your family.
I didn't do anything.

849
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:07,475
You England.

850
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:10,058
I'm not England. I'm Ireland.

851
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:12,558
- You bloody England!

852
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:14,433

May the pox disfigure them!

855
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,391
May the plague consume them!

856
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:19,975

857
00:57:22,558 --> 00:57:25,933

Left you in the river
or with them devils last night.

903
01:01:32,308 --> 01:01:33,516
Can you fix it?

904
01:01:35,475 --> 01:01:37,183
Please? It's broken.

905
01:01:43,475 --> 01:01:45,516
Not broken.

906
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,558
Just got wet
when you threw it in the river.

907
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:52,141
Where did you get that?

908
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:55,183
Stole it from the hut

909
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:56,725
where that bastard one
shoot at me.

910
01:01:56,808 --> 01:01:58,808
- What?
- I'm smart.

911
01:01:58,891 --> 01:02:01,516
You white ones
go fast, fast, fast

912
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,308
get nowhere.

913
01:02:03,391 --> 01:02:07,266
I go slow,
get everything done.

914
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,475
I'm blackbird.

915
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:11,808
Just fix it.
We need to get going.

916
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:24,766
Hurry up.

917
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,808
Here!

918
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:32,391

919
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:33,933

01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:36,850
Mooltee! Over here!

922
01:02:37,475 --> 01:02:38,725
Let me go.

923
01:02:38,808 --> 01:02:39,725
Help!

924
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,433
[war cry]

925
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:42,600
Over here!

[grunting]

927
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,600
Let me go.

Mooltee!

931
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,433
Did you find Koa?

932
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:57,350
Stop Lowanna!

933
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:58,516
He's on his own.

934
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,766
Be calm Lowanna.

935
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:00,808
Where's Koa?

936
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,058
Where's Koa? Is he safe?

937
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:03,225
We stop!

938
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:04,725
We stop!

939
01:03:05,141 --> 01:03:06,266
Don't shoot.

940
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:09,183
Don't shoot.

941
01:03:09,266 --> 01:03:11,100
[gunshot]

942
01:03:11,183 --> 01:03:12,016
No!

943
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:13,891
No!

944
01:03:14,808 --> 01:03:15,641
No!

945
01:03:15,933 --> 01:03:17,891
- Lowanna.
- Go, boy!

946
01:03:17,975 --> 01:03:18,891
Lowanna.

947
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:20,850
[sobbing]

948
01:03:24,891 --> 01:03:26,183
Lowanna.

949
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,391
Lowanna.

950
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:37,808
[panting]

951
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:40,058
- All dead, were they?
- Where's Jago?

952
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,891
Forget him. He's done for.

953
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:45,808
[panting]

954
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,058

[grunts]

956
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,016
Them tracks here, older ones.

957
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:26,016
- But these ones fresh.
- What? I don't under...

958
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,100
Shh.

959
01:04:28,766 --> 01:04:30,891
Coming back this way.

960
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,683
Going over there.

961
01:04:32,766 --> 01:04:36,016
That big fella,
the soldier one.

962
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,850
Walk like this.

963
01:04:37,933 --> 01:04:39,683
He went that way.

964
01:04:39,766 --> 01:04:42,350
- When?
- Very close.

965
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,266
He's hurt. There's blood.

966
01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:47,891

967
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:16,058

968
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:27,225
Hello?

969
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,225
Hello?

970
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:00,141
Ah!

971
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,266
What are you doing?

972
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,683
I just wanted him to stop
is all.

973
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:08,225
If that one's your husband,
you need another husband.

974
01:06:08,308 --> 01:06:11,225
- How do we get to him?
- I don't want no trouble.

975
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:14,850
Please help me.

976
01:06:17,433 --> 01:06:18,850
You know what it's like
to have a whitefella

977
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,100
take everything you have,
don't you?

978
01:06:23,225 --> 01:06:25,600
They stole something from me

979
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:27,558
and I need to get it back.

980
01:06:31,516 --> 01:06:34,641
- You got the rum, lad.
- It's all I could get, sir.

981
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:36,141
It was the best thing
you could have got.

982
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,933
At least we can get drunk
tonight.

983
01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:40,183
You did better
than the sergeant.

984
01:06:40,266 --> 01:06:41,891
He picked up bugger all.

985
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,266
No tears now. Be a man.

986
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,141
I'm not cryin', sir.
Tears are for girls.

987
01:06:51,933 --> 01:06:53,850
You know how to work a pistol?

988
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,808
No, sir.

989
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,683
Would you like to learn?

990
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:00,683
Yes, sir.

991
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,433
Come and walk up front.

992
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:05,683
You can have some rum, too,
once we stop.

993
01:07:08,516 --> 01:07:09,683
Sergeant.

994
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:12,516
You walk back.

995
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,850
- Keep a lookout at the rear.
- Yes, sir.

996
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:17,433
That way if they attack again,
you'll be the first to go.

997
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,600
How long now, boy?
Get there tomorrow?

998
01:07:22,683 --> 01:07:24,933
Maybe, boss.
Maybe day after.

999
01:07:25,016 --> 01:07:27,600
I'll give you big reward if you
get us there by tomorrow, boy.

1000
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:41,225
Go get Becky
and wait for me there.

1001
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,475
Go!

1002
01:07:47,475 --> 01:07:49,391
[panting]

1003
01:08:04,141 --> 01:08:05,725
I surrender!

1004
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:07,141
You surrender?

You surrender?

1008
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:22,598
I didn't mean to kill the babe.

1009
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,932
I just wanted it to be quiet.

1010
01:08:25,016 --> 01:08:26,308
Please.

1011
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:27,641
Please!

1012

1013
01:08:32,557 --> 01:08:34,015
Please, I..

1014
01:08:34,098 --> 01:08:36,473
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please.
I didn't mean it.

Boy.

1034
01:11:17,932 --> 01:11:19,682
Please, just..

1035
01:11:19,766 --> 01:11:21,058
Billy, please.

1036
01:11:23,725 --> 01:11:25,057
Don't leave.

1037
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:32,600
I'll give you everything I got.

1038
01:11:32,682 --> 01:11:34,100
Becky's yours.

1039
01:11:34,182 --> 01:11:35,600
Do you know
how much she's worth?

1040
01:11:35,682 --> 01:11:36,850
Ten whole pounds.

1041
01:11:36,932 --> 01:11:38,432
I'll sell her for you
in Launceston.

1042
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:40,558
Don't want her.

1043
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:42,433
If you go back that way,
you won't last five hours

1044
01:11:42,516 --> 01:11:44,808
before some whitefella
tries to blow your head off.

1045

Billy, please.

1046
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,266
I can't be out here on my own.

1047
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,557
What did he do to ya
to make you do that to him?

1048
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:11,600
You're not lookin'
for your husband, are ya?

1049
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,932

Up there?

01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:03,265
Not here?

1055
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,266
Too many blackfella that way.

1056
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,725
More fight, get killed.

1057
01:13:08,807 --> 01:13:10,015
No good.

1058
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:13,558
This looks steep.

Blackfella chasing you now
'cause you killed that woman.

1060

...I'll not baulk to put a shot
in your brain!

1074

You and your black monkey!

Fuckin' animals!

1076
01:15:01,682 --> 01:15:03,600
Big, big fight here.

1077
01:15:09,307 --> 01:15:12,265
This is where the big fella
got the spear

1078
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:14,100
before you finished him.

1079
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,350
Them soldiers shot a blackfella.

1080
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:25,350
His family carry him away.

1081
01:15:34,766 --> 01:15:36,100
It was a woman.

1082
01:15:37,891 --> 01:15:41,683
You sure you wanna follow him?
Them mad devils.

1083
01:15:41,766 --> 01:15:43,975
I came here to do something
and I'm gonna do it.

1084

You comin'?

1085

1086
01:15:58,307 --> 01:16:00,765
You sure this is the best way?

1087

1099
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:39,475
No one go up that way,
not even blackfella.

She won't get through there.
Too steep.

[indistinct shouting]

1634

I am Letteremairrener man

1641
02:08:25,516 --> 02:08:29,308
Back on my homeland

1642
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:36,600
I am with my mother and my father

Summer will come

02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:31,891
and the grass will grow

1653
02:10:36,807 --> 02:10:39,350
Green leaves will sprout

1654
02:10:39,432 --> 02:10:43,807
on top of the trees

1655
02:10:47,725 --> 02:10:50,350
My true love will come

1656
02:10:50,432 --> 02:10:54,557
at the break of day

1657
02:10:58,975 --> 02:11:02,641
And he'll strike up a song

1658
02:11:02,725 --> 02:11:07,225
out of love for me
