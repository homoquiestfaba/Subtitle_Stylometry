1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,806
Fade the music out.

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,208
Let's roll.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,077
Hold there.

4
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:17,216
Lights.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,717
Do the lights.

6
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,339
Thank you.

7
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:02,160
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

8
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:06,265
I don't necessarily agree with
you, but I appreciate very much.

9
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,516
Well, this is a nice place.

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,601
This is easily the nicest place

11
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,805
For many miles
in every direction.

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,363
That's how you
compliment a building

13
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:25,617
And shit on a town
with one sentence.

14
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,620
It is odd around here,
as I was driving here.

15
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,155
There doesn't seem to be
any difference

16
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:35,043
Between the sidewalk and
the street for pedestrians here.

17
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,164
People just kind of walk
in the middle of the road.

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,838
I love traveling

19
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,972
And seeing all the different
parts of the country.

20
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,924
I live in new york.
I live in a--

21
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:52,060
There's no value
to your doing that at all.

22
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:54,763
I live--
I live in new york.

23
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,399
I always--

24
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,351
Like, there's this old lady
in my neighborhood,

25
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,019
And she's always
walking her dog.

26
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:03,722
She's always just--
she's very old.

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,658
She just stands there
just being old,

28
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,745
And the dog just fights gravity
every day, just--

29
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,864
The two of them, it's really--

30
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:16,668
The dog's got a cloudy eye,
and she's got a cloudy eye,

31
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,787
And they just stand there
looking at the street

32
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,340
In two dimensions together,
and--

33
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,046
And she's always wearing, like,
this old sweater dress.

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,582
I guess it was a sweater
when she was, like, 5'10",

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,718
But now it's just,
like, this sweater

36
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,271
And her legs are--
her legs are a nightmare.

37
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:42,093
They're just white with green
streaks and bones sticking out.

38
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,428
Her legs are awful.

39
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,230
I saw a guy with no legs
wheeling by,

40
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:48,650
And he was like,
"yecch, no thank you.

41
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,654
"I do not want those.

42
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:57,609
"I'd rather just have air
down here like I have

43
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,380
Than to look down at that shit."

44
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,555
I see these two all the time,
and I always look at them,

45
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,591
And I always think,
"god, I hope she dies first."

46
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,092
I do.

47
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,261
I hope she dies first,
for her sake,

48
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,646
Because I don't want her
to lose the dog.

49
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,648
I don't think she'll
be able to handle it.

50
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:20,983
If she dies--

51
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,801
If the old lady dies first,
I'm not worried about the dog

52
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:27,239
Because the dog doesn't even
know about the old lady.

53
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:33,161
This dog is aware of
three inches around his head.

54
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:38,149
He's living
in two-second increments.

55
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,419
The second he's in
and the one he just left

56
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,289
Is all he knows about,

57
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:48,293
But if he dies, this lady,
she's gonna be destroyed

58
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,963
Because this dog is all she has,

59
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:55,217
And I know he's all she has
because she has him.

60
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,386
There's no--

61
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,004
If she had one person
in her life,

62
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,890
She would not keep
this piece of shit little dog.

63
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,559
Even if just some young woman
in her building one morning

64
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,061
Were to say,
"good morning, gladys,"

65
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,145
She'd be like, "good,"

66
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,014
And just flush him
down the toilet, just--

67
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,372
Poom! Poom!

68
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,625
The dog just keeps
bumping on the drain.

69
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,079
Poom!

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,082
"" she gives up.

71
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,469
Ends up just shitting on her dog
for the rest of her life.

72
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,586
P-p-p!

73
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,844
Poom!

74
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,851
You ever flush a pet
down the toilet?

75
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,487
I had to flush my daughter's
fish down the toilet.

76
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,888
I came home, the fish was dead.

77
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:53,025
She wasn't home from school yet,
so I just flushed the fish,

78
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,411
And that's a weird moment, too,
'cause fish live in water.

79
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:58,580
So you put it in the toilet,
floats to the bottom,

80
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,032
Like, "yeah, he's dead,"

81
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,333
And then you flush,
and it looks like he goes,

82
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:06,621
"wait a second! Aw, shit!

83
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,959
"I was taking a nap! Jesus!

84
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,544
"you gotta be in constant motion

85
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,847
To get any respect
in this house."

86
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,752
And then my daughter comes home.

87
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,054
"why did he die, da--"

88
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:27,359
Come on. What am I gonna say?
Why did he die?

89
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,312
Because who gives a shit?
That's the reason.

90
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,699
That's the actual reason,
is because didn't matter

91
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,150
That he was alive.

92
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,236
That's why he's dead.

93
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,322
He didn't know his name,
and he didn't love you back.

94
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,792
These are the facts
about that fish's life.

95
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,998
My daughter likes fish.
We took her to the aquarium.

96
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,117
I took both my kids
to the aquarium in boston,

97
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,087
And we were looking
at this seal, or sea lion.

98
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,256
I don't know which one.
I don't care.

99
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,343
I don't think they need
to be separate things.

100
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,811
I really don't.

101
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,680
They don't care,
and we don't care.

102
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,399
There's, like, three scientists

103
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,685
Who give a shit
what we call all those things.

104
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,070
The scientists could
go on tv tomorrow

105
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,188
And say, "ok, everybody.

106
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:18,827
"from now on, seals
and sea lions and walruses,

107
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:26,418
And--you know what?--Penguins
are all seals now,"

108
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:31,289
And we would all be like,
"yeah, all right. Fine. Yes.

109
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,825
Whatever, man."

110
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,962
Anyway, so we're looking
at this seal/sea lion thing,

111
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,664
And he's looking back at us
through the plexiglas,

112
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:40,849
And he's going--

113
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,555
They're really disgusting
in person.

114
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,523
Most animals are
when you really see them.

115
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:49,891
You ever go to a farm?

116
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,276
You think you're gonna see
little, white sheep

117
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,895
Going, "baa," but they're
all fat and shit-colored,

118
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,946
And they're like--

119
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,368
Jesus.

120
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,871
That thing is awful.

121
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,122
Anyway, seals don't go--

122
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,158
They go--

123
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:11,663
My daughter's like,
"what is he saying?"

124
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,498
I don't know!

125
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:17,702
"I'm a slave!

126
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,805
Kill me!"

127
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:32,517
Must be awful to be
other kinds of stuff,

128
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,236
You know?

129
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,655
I'm glad I'm this.

130
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,610
This is a pretty good deal when
you consider the alternatives.

131
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,198
Anything else, any other kind of
thing, you're in the food chain.

132
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,584
You're in the food--
we are out of the food chain.

133
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,870
I don't know if we
fully appreciate the fact

134
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:55,240
That we got
out of the food chain.

135
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,243
That is a massive upgrade

136
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,545
Because for every other
living thing,

137
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:03,131
Life ends by being eaten.

138
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,467
That's how all life ends, is--

139
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,602
Every single life
except human life,

140
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,137
Every life ends like this.

141
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,607
Aah! Aah! Aah!

142
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,649
We're the only ones that get
to just die old in a bed,

143
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,403
Just "I love you. Bye."

144
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,081
I mean, imagine if we were
still in the food chain

145
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,083
On top of everything else.

146
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,252
Imagine if we were
in the food chain.

147
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,973
It would just be another thing
you gotta deal with.

148
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,893
You're already having a bad day.

149
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,345
You wake in up in the morning.
You're making breakfast.

150
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,733
You burn your toast,
and it's too late to try again,

151
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,687
And your kid comes in and says,
"beh," and you're like, "fine,"

152
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,740
And it's just, "why?"

153
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,326
You get a thing in the mail

154
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,312
That says that
your phone's different,

155
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,615
And your mortgage
is another company now.

156
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,253
What? I don't get it!

157
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,655
Then you're walking to work
like, "why do I even bother?

158
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:21,376
"shit! Goddamn it!

159
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,496
"there's always fucking cheetahs
at the train station!

160
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:28,166
Stop it!"

161
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,474
You think that sharks--

162
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,527
Do you think that sharks
would be embarrassed

163
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,846
If they knew that we could all
see their fins

164
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:47,152
Sticking out
the top of the water?

165
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,187
I think they'd be bummed

166
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:52,324
'cause I don't think sharks
are aware of that at all.

167
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,492
I think sharks think
they're slick.

168
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,044
They swim around like,

169
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:01,166
"hey, nobody has any idea
what's down here,"

170
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,367
And we're all up here like,

171
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,754
"there's totally a shark
right there."

172
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,592
It wouldn't be fun
being a predator, either.

173
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,144
If you're a predator, imagine
if every time you're hungry,

174
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,765
You gotta chase a guy

175
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,067
Who's running for his life.

176
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,936
You gotta-- "come on, dude!
Shit, get over here!"

177
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,322
And just hold him down
and bite his neck

178
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,892
Till he shuts the fuck up
for a minute

179
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,362
So you can just sit there
and eat his stomach

180
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,731
Before you go to work.

181
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,121
That would really suck.

182
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,339
That's why animals just--

183
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,425
They go, "let's do this
together, man.

184
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,876
"you chase the parents away.

185
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,012
I am gonna eat the kid,
and you circle back."

186
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,347
That's why they do it like that.

187
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,384
"fuck it. I'm eating babies.
This is bullshit."

188
00:10:57,106 --> 00:11:00,809
"grownups ain't worth
the meat."

189
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,862
Whoops, all right.

190
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,447
All right.

191
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,649
shit.

192
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,985
Goddamn it.

193
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,788
Idiot.

194
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:16,157
This isn't a gay voice,
by the way.

195
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,792
It's not.

196
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:22,297
Shut up.

197
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,550
yeah.

198
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,887
I live in new york city,
and it's ok there.

199
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,088
I live in a nice building.

200
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,423
I never lived
in a nice place before.

201
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,591
When I was growing up,
I had no money.

202
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,728
I mean, my mom didn't.
Didn't matter. I was a child.

203
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,681
But I'm not used to it
'cause it's nice.

204
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,399
There's, like,
a pretty courtyard

205
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:46,321
With flowers and a fountain
with little marble boys pissing.

206
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:51,326
I don't know.
What is it with fountains?

207
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,280
Like, all fountain sculptors
are pedophiles, basically.

208
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,782
You can't get a fountain
made without--

209
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,417
"can you make me a fountain?"

210
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,170
"yes, I'll get started
right away!

211
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,673
"Yes!

212
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,960
Yes!

213
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,763
It's finished!"

214
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,999
And it's just little boys
pissing on the face

215
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:18,853
Of a greek god
that looks like him a lot.

216
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:22,524
"just piss on me forever!"

217
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,032
Anyway, there's one of those
in the courtyard of my building,

218
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:35,069
And my first week in
the building about a year ago,

219
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,189
I went down to the courtyard
for the first time,

220
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,857
And I didn't look
too good, you know?

221
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,859
It was a Sunday morning.

222
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:44,913
That's my
least presentable hour.

223
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,198
There's a lot of, you know,
just stains,

224
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:50,218
Just like, you know,
food and me and whatever...

225
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:55,256
And so I'm sitting there.

226
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,643
So? Shut up.

227
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,512
Ha ha ha!

228
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,017
Anyway, but so there I was.

229
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,570
I'm sitting on the stone bench
of this courtyard

230
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:11,389
And feeling a little
out of place.

231
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,107
You know, there's
these fancy doormen and stuff,

232
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,943
And then there's this guy
looking at me.

233
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,895
I notice he's looking at me
from across the courtyard,

234
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:19,697
And he's all spiffy-looking.

235
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:23,618
He's got brown shoes, and he's
looking at me like, ""

236
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,205
I can tell he was thinking
I don't live in the building.

237
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,874
He thinks I just wandered in
off the streets

238
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,376
And sat in the courtyard.

239
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,578
I can tell he's thinking
of coming over

240
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:36,514
And dealing with me on his own,
and I'm sitting there thinking,

241
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,852
Like, "please do that. Yes.
Please, come on, come on.

242
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,971
Come on, come on, come on,"

243
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,856
And I'm trying to look
even more gross,

244
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,560
And I'm, like,
pulling up my shirt, ""

245
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,446
And then I see him go, "no.
That's not gonna do at all,"

246
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,234
And he comes over to me,
"" and I'm like,

247
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,485
"Num num num!"

248
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,873
I'm so excited to have
this thing, a confrontation

249
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:06,044
Where I'm not wrong at all
and he thinks I am.

250
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,212
"rrgh!"

251
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,781
So he comes over, says,
"excuse me,

252
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,334
"do you live in this building?"

253
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:18,139
And I said, "no,"

254
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:22,644
'cause why not start there?

255
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,812
I said, "no."

256
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,015
He goes, "well then,
what are you doing here?"

257
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,850
And I said, "I just need
to rest.

258
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,269
I'm having a hard time."

259
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,692
He says,
"this is private property,"

260
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,112
And I said, "well, I don't
really believe in that."

261
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,781
You know, just the worst things
I could say

262
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,483
From his point of view

263
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,985
Is basically all the things
I was saying,

264
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,504
And he goes,
"well, if you don't leave,

265
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:50,705
I'm gonna talk to the doorman."

266
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,758
I was like, "can I just stay,
like, five more hours?"

267
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:58,096
So he's--"no,"
and he goes over to the doorman

268
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,549
And I see him talking about me
to the doorman like this,

269
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,134
And then I see the doorman
going, "no.

270
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:08,222
That guy lives here. It's ok,"

271
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:13,194
And the look on his face--
mwah mwah! Num num!--

272
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,146
It was just so--

273
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,286
It was this beautiful cocktail
of anger and confusion.

274
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,958
It's like I had invented a new
way to hurt somebody's feelings.

275
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,911
That's how excited I was.

276
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,866
I'm 45 now,

277
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,835
So I'm either halfway through
a healthy life

278
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:41,923
Or almost done
with a not-so-healthy life.

279
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,808
I don't know which one.

280
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:48,429
I won't know till it's over
where this was.

281
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,932
I don't know how long
I'm gonna live.

282
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,067
I don't know.
Nobody knows, I guess.

283
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:56,220
I think human life expectancy
is pretty good.

284
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,356
We get a good run, you know?

285
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,108
Some people die early, you know?

286
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,610
If I die now, people will be
like, "that's too bad."

287
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,329
If I die five years from now,
they'll be like,

288
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,698
"well, all right,"
like it's not even--

289
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,333
It's--

290
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,569
Like, as soon as you're 50,
you're a candidate.

291
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,755
You know, there's
no candlelight vigils

292
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:17,842
For 50-year-old guys that die,

293
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,460
And you start pushing--

294
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,463
You know, some people get to be
like, 80s, 90s.

295
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,466
You know, there are people
that get to, like, 114,

296
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,720
And then they're in the news,
and it's always some old guy,

297
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,521
"I met napoleon."

298
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,890
No, you didn't, you liar,

299
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:36,444
You oldest liar in the world.

300
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:42,367
But 45, you know,
you're not old yet,

301
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,985
But you start having moments

302
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,404
Where you kind of start getting
what old is,

303
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,775
Especially if you didn't
take care of yourself, you know?

304
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,293
I have moments where I'm like,

305
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:55,112
"wow, this seems early
for this."

306
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,249
Like, this is something
that happens to me a lot.

307
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,786
I'll be sitting watching tv
or doing nothing,

308
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,422
And all of a sudden,
I'll realize,

309
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,892
"I need to wipe my ass
right now."

310
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:19,153
"I mean, nothing happened,

311
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,689
But I really gotta
wipe my ass right now.

312
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,776
Right now."

313
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,246
Gotta make trips to the bathroom
just to wipe my ass.

314
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,698
How does this happen already?

315
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,417
I'm 45.

316
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:37,655
Already, my asshole's just like,
"Just-- "

317
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,425
My asshole--

318
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,161
My asshole's like the waistband
on old pajama bottoms,

319
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:46,180
Just kinda...

320
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,516
Loose and ineffectual.

321
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,640
My asshole's like a bag
of leaves that nobody tied up.

322
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:02,396
It's just sitting on the lawn,
full and open,

323
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:09,620
Puking leaves onto the grass
with every wisp of wind.

324
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,241
Some kid kicks it over
on his way home

325
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,878
From a tough day
at middle school.

326
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:19,464
"rats."

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,637
That's a pretty accurate
description of my asshole.

328
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,556
Here's another thing
about my age right now.

329
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,842
If I'm--
ok. Say I'm sitting down.

330
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,762
If I'm sitting anywhere,
which--ha ha ha!--

331
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,181
I love sitting so much--

332
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,216
I would take sitting
and doing nothing

333
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:41,736
To standing and fucking any day.

334
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,190
This is way better than coming.
This is way better.

335
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,162
This is what--

336
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,247
At my age, if I'm sitting down
and somebody tells me

337
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,867
I need to get up
and go to another room,

338
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:01,255
I need to be told
all the information why first.

339
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,574
You gotta explain
all that shit to me.

340
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:07,411
"what? Why do I--
no. Why, though?"

341
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,213
"your car is being towed
right now!"

342
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:13,050
"well, that's what happens
to me, then. That's--

343
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,437
I accept that."

344
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,973
'cause getting up
is a whole thing.

345
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,391
It means first,
I have to decide,

346
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,777
"do I really want
to be alive anymore?"

347
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:27,365
Like, let's start with that,

348
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:32,403
And then I gotta, "" start
kind of rocking to get momentum,

349
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:38,108
"" like I'm trying to get
an old honda out of a snow bank.

350
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:54,291
"shit."

351
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,179
The worst part of my day,
worst part of every day

352
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,933
Of my life, is when
I have to put on my socks.

353
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,935
Putting on my socks
is the worst part

354
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,771
Of every day,
and it always will be.

355
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,740
Even if I have a terrible day
in the future

356
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:16,747
Where my grandmother is murdered
by my other grandmother,

357
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,834
If that ever happened to me,
the worst part of that day

358
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:24,288
Will be when I put on
my socks because--

359
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:26,707
Putting on my socks,
that means I have to--

360
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,758
Here's what I have to do.

361
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,328
I have to get my hands
past my pointed toe.

362
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,848
I don't even know how I do it.

363
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:37,184
I'm sitting here.
I don't know how I do that.

364
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:38,519
It's 'cause you have to--

365
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:45,943
It's like folding
a bowling ball in half.

366
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,862
Soon as I start, I can feel--

367
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:51,649
I'm pushing all the fat up
into my vital organs,

368
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,484
And I just feel
all the systems failing.

369
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,652
"beep, beep, beep!"

370
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,992
And I have to, like, lay on
my back like an eight-year-old

371
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,878
And go like this,
and I start passing out.

372
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:16,040
And I know
other people's lives are hard.

373
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:20,428
Ha ha ha!

374
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,597
I know.

375
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,817
I saw an interview on tv
with michael j. Fox,

376
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,103
And he has parkinson's,
and he was describing

377
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,988
Brushing his teeth, and he said

378
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,058
It takes him two hours a day,
and he said it's agony,

379
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,827
And I saw this and I thought,
"ok. That's hard."

380
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,829
That is hard,

381
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,033
And so is putting on my socks.

382
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,586
Sorry, michael.

383
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,873
Doesn't make it easier to know
about your thing.

384
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,240
Tell you what.

385
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:54,411
I'll help you brush your teeth,
you help me with the socks.

386
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,931
I don't know.
I like getting older, though.

387
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:59,517
Life is an education, and
if you're older, you're smarter.

388
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,768
I just believe that.

389
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,103
If you're in an argument
with somebody

390
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,138
And they're older than you,
you should listen to them.

391
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,756
It doesn't mean they're right.

392
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,274
It means that
even if they're wrong,

393
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,278
Their wrongness is rooted in
more information than you have.

394
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,615
They've been there longer.
If you're older, you're smarter.

395
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:17,068
How many people here,
by applause, are 45 or older?

396
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,652
45 or older, applaud.

397
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,956
Ok.

398
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,111
That's about 60 people
out of 2,400.

399
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,948
Here's the interesting thing.
There's way more. I can see you.

400
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:33,551
There's so many more.

401
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,952
This is arizona.

402
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,055
There are way more people
in that demographic,

403
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,290
But they didn't clap.

404
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:43,460
Why? 'cause they're smart.

405
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:45,262
They're sitting in the dark
going, "I don't have to clap.

406
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:47,064
I don't have to do anything."

407
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,934
They're not doing it,
and they're right.

408
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,803
You know why?
'cause never identify yourself.

409
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:56,273
Never. Are you crazy?
You don't know why I'm asking.

410
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:57,658
How do you know what--

411
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,693
Ok. Burn them all.
Burn everybody over 45.

412
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,980
How do you know
I'm not gonna do that?

413
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,653
How many people here,
by applause, are 40 or younger?

414
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,038
40 or younger, applaud.

415
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,827
That's every time.
"whoo! Whoo!" every time.

416
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:20,598
That is a weird thing
to celebrate

417
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,167
In a room where you're
not the only people here.

418
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,852
That's like going
to a cancer ward--

419
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,937
"not me! Whoo!

420
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:32,810
I don't have it!
I don't have it!"

421
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,034
If you're older, you're smarter.

422
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:45,022
A 55-year-old garbage man
is a million times smarter

423
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,026
Than a 28-year-old
with three ph.D.S,

424
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:51,829
Especially smarter than him,
'cause this idiot

425
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,499
Has been thinking about three
things for, like, 15 years.

426
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,469
He's worthless.

427
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,704
The garbage man is 55.

428
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,808
He's had some experience.
Things have happened to him.

429
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,559
He went to cape cod one summer.

430
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:08,879
He saw a dead guy
floating in the motel pool.

431
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:16,220
He took a bus to montreal.

432
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:23,577
He got a hand job at a fair...

433
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,898
From a miner.

434
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:36,757
I mean a miner.

435
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:40,461
Not a minor, a miner.

436
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,748
You understand? A miner.

437
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:48,219
A grown man who works in a mine

438
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,588
With dirty hands
jacked him off at a county fair.

439
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:54,808
That's what I'm saying happened
to the 55-year-old.

440
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,145
You see?
He's had some experience.

441
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,930
He knows more.

442
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,815
More has happened to him.
He's seen more.

443
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,933
He's seen history.

444
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:04,318
He's witnessed history,

445
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,953
Even if it's not
ancient history.

446
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:08,822
He saw nixon resign
on live television.

447
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,574
Me and those few people
that clapped,

448
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:15,162
We saw
the president of america cry

449
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,499
And then quit being
the president.

450
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,919
That shit was crazy

451
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,889
'cause none of us knew
what was gonna happen next.

452
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,056
Today people are like,

453
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,841
"the president's
kind of disappointing."

454
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:28,926
Really?

455
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,979
Our president wept
like an insane person

456
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,566
And then got on a helicopter
and flew away...

457
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,826
And the whole nation
just watched him go.

458
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,427
I like getting older, though,
because for me,

459
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,429
The kind of guy I am,
getting older

460
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,164
Makes my life better, you know,

461
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:10,050
Like, my sex life,
way better at 45,

462
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:15,940
Look, 'cause this situation
is ok at 45.

463
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:21,111
This is not a fun kind
of a 17-year-old to be.

464
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,896
And some people, their life
is better when they're younger.

465
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,783
You know, young dudes,
young, skinny dudes,

466
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:30,237
Best life in the world
is being a young, skinny dude.

467
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,122
They don't have to do anything.

468
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,124
They just show up

469
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,829
With a big adam's apple
and a smelly t-shirt.

470
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,249
"hey, I'm here for the easy
pussy for the rest of my life."

471
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,893
"so where do I--
everywhere? Ok. Cool."

472
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,401
But for guys like me,
this is not a fun youth.

473
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,219
It gets better.

474
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:05,572
I'd like to make one of those
"it gets better" ads

475
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:08,325
For just dumpy, young guys.

476
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,695
We could use a little help,
a little encouragement,

477
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,497
Just somebody on tv,
"listen, man.

478
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,616
"I know it's tough right now.

479
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,453
"you're vaguely heavy
with no face.

480
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:23,791
"you have zero value
on the sexual marketplace.

481
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:28,045
"you feel invisible to the girls
in school because you are,

482
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,800
"but it gets better
because you'll all grow up,

483
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,886
"and you pretty much look
just like this your whole life,

484
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,438
"and they don't.

485
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:40,641
"their options start running out
really fast,

486
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,559
"and you're gonna be there.

487
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:44,978
"as long as you stay
relatively employed and washed,

488
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,098
"you're gonna be amazing
in your 40s.

489
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:49,366
"you're gonna be--

490
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,368
"you're gonna be the branch
that she can grab

491
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,120
"before she hits the ground.

492
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:55,772
"it's gonna be so great.

493
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:00,377
"it just takes time
for her circumstances

494
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,213
"to match your looks,
but it's gonna happen.

495
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,499
"it's gonna happen.

496
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,084
"when real shit matters,

497
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,787
You're gonna be the sexiest
motherfucker in the world."

498
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,456
It's just time.
That's all it takes.

499
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:13,891
There's a formula to this.

500
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,394
It's pussy plus time
over income squared.

501
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,990
Everybody has their time.
Everybody has their time.

502
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:32,910
I mean, not everybody.

503
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,697
There are people out there who
there's just nobody for them.

504
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,816
Yep.

505
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,953
People like to say things like,
"there's someone for everyone."

506
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,339
Nope!

507
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,841
Not at all true,
and stop saying it

508
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:51,512
'cause it's mean to people
who never find anybody.

509
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,963
There are millions
of people out there

510
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,549
Who we've all
unanimously decided,

511
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,468
They are light speed ugly

512
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,387
And nobody kisses them
on the lips, even.

513
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,606
Nobody touches their genitals
their entire life.

514
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,224
They just wash it,
and then they die.

515
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,977
That's all that happens,

516
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,029
"aww," and if you're
feeling bad for them,

517
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,981
You can go find one
and fuck one tomorrow,

518
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:16,120
You can just solve the problem
right there

519
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,190
With all that kindness
in your heart.

520
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:24,461
"aww." well, go fuck one.
"nah." I didn't think so.

521
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,383
That's the one way
we're all mean.

522
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:34,555
Nobody does that.
Nobody fucks down, nobody.

523
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:37,224
People fuck up or across.

524
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,182
Some women fuck down
because a guy

525
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,401
Talked them into that it was up.

526
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:52,489
Some guy, "yeah. No. You should.
I'm totally up. Yeah."

527
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,359
It's a weird selection process
that we have.

528
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,860
Dating really is--

529
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:58,495
It's how we evolve, is dating.

530
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,997
It's how we
choose each other,

531
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,898
And dating is a real drag
for a lot of people,

532
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,400
But I always think
it's a nice thing.

533
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:04,701
You know, when I see a date,

534
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,753
I'm always happy when I see
a couple on a date

535
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,840
'cause it means people
are still trying, you know?

536
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:10,907
You see a couple on a date,

537
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,926
It means there's still
courage out there.

538
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,963
That takes courage, to go
on a date, for both sides,

539
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,464
Two very different kinds
of courage.

540
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,916
The male courage,
traditionally speaking,

541
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:22,269
Is that he decided to ask.

542
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,254
He went up to a random woman
who he has no idea

543
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:25,589
If she's gonna like him or not

544
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,441
And he walked up to her
terrified.

545
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:28,775
Everything in your body
is telling you,

546
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,444
"just go the fuck home
and jerk off.

547
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:33,780
Don't do this!"

548
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:38,318
But he walked up and said,
"hi. Yes,"

549
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,204
And she's like, ""

550
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,606
"no, no, no. A second.
Give me a second,"

551
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:46,043
And you try to get through
this membrane of, you know--

552
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,377
And then, if it works

553
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,329
And you say,
"you wanna go out sometime?"

554
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,999
Sometimes she'll say yes,
and if she says yes,

555
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,301
That's her courage,
and the courage it takes

556
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:58,255
For a woman to say yes is
beyond anything I can imagine.

557
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:03,176
A woman saying yes to a date
with a man is literally insane

558
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:08,348
And ill-advised,
and the whole species' existence

559
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,968
Counts on them doing it,
and I don't know how they--

560
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:14,938
How do women still go out with
guys when you consider the fact

561
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:18,492
That there is no greater threat
to women than men?

562
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:22,162
We're the number-one
threat to women.

563
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:25,165
Globally and historically,
we're the number-one cause

564
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:28,035
Of injury and mayhem to women.

565
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,038
We're the worst thing
that ever happens to them.

566
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,756
That's true.

567
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,258
You know what
our number-one threat is?

568
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,760
Heart disease.
That's the whole thing.

569
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,013
That's it, just our own heart
going, "dude, I can't--

570
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,015
"you can't keep doing this.

571
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:47,220
I told you three strokes ago
that this is not smart,"

572
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,723
But women still--

573
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,609
"yeah. I'll go out with you
alone at night."

574
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,896
What are you, nuts?

575
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,649
"I'll get in your car with you
with my little shoulders.

576
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,350
Hi. Where are we going?"

577
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:05,021
"to your death, statistically."

578
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,659
How do they still do it?

579
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,695
If you're a guy, try to imagine
that you could only date

580
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:14,715
A half-bear, half-lion,

581
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:18,418
And you're like,
"I hope this one's nice.

582
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:22,139
I hope he doesn't do
what he's going to do."

583
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:32,065
I always--
I love when I see a date.

584
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,101
You know, when you see a date,
you can tell it's the first date

585
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,069
'cause of the way they're
walking together

586
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:38,822
And she's looking up at his face
trying to figure him out,

587
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,225
And he's just a mess.

588
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:46,747
A guy on a first date
just has no actual personality.

589
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,898
He's just a mishmash

590
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:52,285
Of different kinds of dudes
for a couple of seconds each,

591
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,372
Just anything, no cohesive--

592
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:59,126
Just like a ransom note
cut out of a lot of magazines,

593
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,761
Just, you know, "well...

594
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,213
"ha ha!

595
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,598
"well, yes. I think so, too.

596
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:06,383
Ha ha! Rrgh..."

597
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,052
Whatever, just like
a blind dick in space

598
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,639
Just thrusting
in infinite directions

599
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:18,445
Hoping to find pay dirt
at someplace,

600
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,364
And then sometimes
you see a date

601
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,265
That's later down the line
and something has happened.

602
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,767
There's something
that happens in a date

603
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:25,736
That I never get to witness
'cause women do this.

604
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,120
They get to do it inside.

605
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,706
They get to just decide quietly,
"I'm gonna let him fuck me."

606
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,791
They just get to decide.

607
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,492
Something he says,
and she's like,

608
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,294
"that was good.
He's gonna fuck me later,"

609
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:36,797
And he has no idea.

610
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,832
He's still, like,
trying all this shit.

611
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:43,170
He still has no idea
he's already in there.

612
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,643
Guys are--

613
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:51,478
We love women a lot--
all men do--

614
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:52,962
And we just look at you.

615
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,398
That's what I do.
I just look at women.

616
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,233
I just--""

617
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,351
Like they're, you know,
cakes in windows.

618
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,021
I just--""

619
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,989
I was walking in new york once,

620
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:05,141
And there's these two very cute
women walking behind me,

621
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,143
And I was trying to walk slowly
so I could hear

622
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,196
What they were saying
to each other, you know,

623
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,648
'cause they were cute,
so I wanted to hear them,

624
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,618
Like that's gonna help me
in any way, to hear their--

625
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,036
"don't you wish the guy
walking in front of us

626
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,422
Would squeeze our tits
for, like, one second?"

627
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,498
Ok.

628
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,685
Here.

629
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,839
Here I go. Thank you.

630
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:44,514
It's really a flaw in men
that we would all do that.

631
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,567
If you're a woman, you could ask
any guy on planet earth,

632
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,569
"could you squeeze my tit
for one second?"

633
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,023
And 100% of us will go,
"yes, of course."

634
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,742
That doesn't matter.

635
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,160
I could be doing
open heart surgery.

636
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:58,745
"yeah. Ok."

637
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,130
Beep! "don't worry.

638
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,833
He's not your tits.
Don't worry about it."

639
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,801
I don't know why
we love tits so much.

640
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:09,172
Some people say it's because
we breastfeed, but so do women,

641
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:12,726
Or, you know, baby women.

642
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,397
Not grown-up women,
don't usually--

643
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:19,816
You don't see, like,
a 68-year-old woman,

644
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:23,887
Like, a stately look--

645
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,438
You know, like sigourney weaver,

646
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,075
Like, sucking milk
out of a young woman's tit.

647
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,033
"thank you, deborah.
I'll see you tomorrow at 2:00."

648
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,338
It's not usually the thing,

649
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,257
Is the elderly breastfeeding
from the young,

650
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,960
Except for at the end
of "the grapes of wrath,"

651
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,129
Which I don't mean
to ruin that book for you,

652
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,514
But you should have read it
by now.

653
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,516
I don't know if you read
"the grapes of wrath,"

654
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,802
But that's how it ends,
with an old, dying man

655
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,688
Sucking milk
out of a young girl's tits,

656
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,392
And then the book is over,
and you're like,

657
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:07,030
"jesus! What happened
at the end there?

658
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,649
That's crazy."

659
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:11,568
There's no other book
in that genre.

660
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:15,438
There's no dense,
historic classic

661
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:19,409
That ends with a weird,
porny paragraph at the very--

662
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,546
"and then anna karenina
shat on his chest."

663
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,051
"holy moly with that!"

664
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,169
"the end."

665
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,956
"my god!

666
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:36,893
"that is a violent shift in tone
at the end of that book.

667
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,295
I've been reading this book
for three months."

668
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:47,737
But we do, we love tits,

669
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:51,024
And you always know a tit.

670
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,476
You always know a tit.

671
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:55,528
You know, like you ever been
in a crowded place--

672
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,983
Like a subway or like,
you know, a sports stadium--

673
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,918
And you're smooshed in
with other people

674
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,320
And your elbow touches a tit
behind you, you're like,

675
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,705
"that's a tit.
I just touched it.

676
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,825
I know that was a tit.
I know it!"

677
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:12,512
Because the sensitivity
of the male elbow

678
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:18,101
To tit flesh specifically
is unbelievable, just to tits,

679
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,271
'cause you could drive a tack
in there, I'm not gonna feel it,

680
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,139
But a tit--

681
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:26,676
Through a shirt and a sweater
and a jacket

682
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:31,197
And her jacket, sweater,
shirt and bra, somehow...

683
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:34,567
"it's a tit! I touched a tit!

684
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,538
"I touched a tit!

685
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:43,209
I touched one tit. One tit."

686
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:46,579
That's rare, to touch one tit.
It's like a four-leaf clover.

687
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,636
Usually, you touch two.

688
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,871
The only time you touch one tit
is when it was an accident

689
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:57,390
Or you didn't have permission,

690
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:01,177
But otherwise...

691
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,563
When tit access is granted,

692
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:06,215
It's usually good
for two tits at a time.

693
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:08,401
It's, once you're on one--

694
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:12,355
You really have to screw up
really badly and quickly

695
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:16,943
To lose tit access
between tits one and two.

696
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,530
You must have said something
really dumb on the first tit

697
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,916
That you didn't get
the second one.

698
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,538
"yeah, it's like your mom's
dirty whore tit."

699
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,874
"why? What? I said I liked it.

700
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,176
"that's what I meant,
is that I like it.

701
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,713
"I like your mom's
dirty whore tit,

702
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,133
And I like yours,"

703
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,053
And if it's up to the guy,
we're gonna touch both tits.

704
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,021
No guy touches a tit
and then goes, "you know what?

705
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,391
"I'm good with the one.
That's fine for me.

706
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:51,594
Everything in moderation."

707
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,279
We're gonna touch both,

708
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:56,099
Even if something terrible
happens in the middle of--

709
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:57,867
"yeah--"
"there's a bomb!"

710
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,903
"shit! Come on, let's get--

711
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,789
"come on!

712
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:06,109
Let's get your tits
out of here!"

713
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,880
I've seen a few tits.

714
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,466
I've seen--I don't know--
48 maybe.

715
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:16,586
I don't know.

716
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,556
I had my history
in my life, you know?

717
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,474
I've been divorced
for five years,

718
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:23,510
And it's been the best part
of my life, being divorced,

719
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,979
Easily my favorite part
of my life.

720
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:27,480
I love being divorced.

721
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,149
Every year has been
better than the last.

722
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,433
That is the only time
I can say that about,

723
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,569
And by the way, I'm not saying
don't get married.

724
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,988
If you meet somebody,
fall in love and get married,

725
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:37,190
And then get divorced
because that's the best part.

726
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,409
It's the best part.

727
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:43,363
Marriage is just like a larva
stage for true happiness,

728
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,314
Which is divorce,

729
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:48,818
Because you just let go
and everything's fine now.

730
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:53,423
Divorce is forever.

731
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,325
It really actually is.

732
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:59,846
Marriage is for how long
you can hack it,

733
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,051
But divorce just gets stronger
like a piece of oak.

734
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,138
Nobody ever says, "
my divorce is falling apart.

735
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:12,058
It's over. I can't take it."

736
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,510
And again, if you're
in a good marriage, stay in it.

737
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:17,147
If you're in the best marriage
ever, stay in it.

738
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,616
I'm just saying, if you got out,
it would be better.

739
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,568
That's just a fact. I'm sorry.

740
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,621
I'm sorry, but it's true.

741
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,355
Everything's better.

742
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:27,690
My ex-wife and I,

743
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,358
This is the best part
of our knowing each other.

744
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:32,912
We're good co-parents because
we live apart and we're friends.

745
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,831
Our kids go to her
half the week,

746
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,083
They come to me half the week,
and I'm a good father.

747
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,669
I'm an attentive, focused,
and responsible father.

748
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,054
Do you know why?

749
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:44,557
'cause I get to say good-bye
to these kids every week.

750
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,810
Are you shitting me?

751
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,546
It's like every parent's
fantasy.

752
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:55,218
Who can't be a good father
for half of every week?

753
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:56,903
No matter how bad it gets,
every Wednesday,

754
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,105
I get to go, "good-bye, girls.

755
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,690
"daddy's gonna go upstairs
and pour whiskey

756
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,943
All over his naked body
right now."

757
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:10,950
"I'm gonna lay in my own filth

758
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,037
Until two seconds
before you come back here."

759
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,373
That's why I'm such a good dad.

760
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:26,015
My daughter was having
a dance thing at her school.

761
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,767
They had this big dance.

762
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,585
Anyway, we all went,
all the parents,

763
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:31,304
And everybody's there,
and everybody's got their phone,

764
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,939
Every single parent.

765
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:34,807
It was an amazing thing to watch
'cause kids are dancing

766
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,477
And every parent
is standing there like this.

767
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,530
Every single person
was blocking their vision

768
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:44,484
Of their actual child
with their phone, and the kids--

769
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,768
I went over by the stage
and the kids--

770
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:49,372
There's people holding ipads
in front of their faces.

771
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,441
It looked like we're all in
the witness protection program.

772
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:55,578
Like, the kids can't see
their parents,

773
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:58,998
And everybody's watching
a shitty movie

774
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,800
Of something
that's happening ten feet--

775
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:03,720
Like, look at your fucking kid.

776
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:08,591
The resolution on the kid is
unbelievable if you just look.

777
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,295
It's totally hd.

778
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:14,647
Why are you taping this?

779
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,150
You're never gonna watch it.

780
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,852
In a million years,
you're not gonna watch videos

781
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,021
Of your kids doing shit
you missed

782
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,774
The first time it happened.

783
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,910
You don't watch it.
You just put it on facebook.

784
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:34,667
"here, you watch it.
I wanna take a nap now."

785
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,120
And then you get to read
all the comments.

786
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,822
"my god!

787
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,459
"it's so cute!

788
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:46,462
Ngaah!"

789
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:52,668
And guess what?
They're not watching it, either.

790
00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:54,670
They're not watching the video.

791
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:59,809
These kids are dancing
for no one.

792
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,729
Nobody watches the videos
on your facebook.

793
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,564
They see the first frame
of a kid and they go,

794
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:08,484
"that's very nice.
Ok. Back to this."

795
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:15,541
Nobody's watching your kids'
videos on facebook,

796
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:16,709
I promise you.

797
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:17,994
I'll prove it to you.

798
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,796
Next time you tape
your kid's dance,

799
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,530
Tape one second of it
and then add

800
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:24,033
20 minutes
of just your own asshole.

801
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:31,224
Just go in the bathroom
and just record your own anus

802
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:34,510
Opening and closing
for 20 minutes.

803
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,599
Tack it onto your kid dancing
for a second.

804
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,520
Put that on facebook.

805
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:45,822
Everybody will write
the same thing.

806
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:50,076
"that's adorable!

807
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,579
I think I see a future star!"

808
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,036
Don't tape shit on your--

809
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,071
Life is short.
Life is very short.

810
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:03,790
I like life. I like it.

811
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,042
I feel like even if it ends up
being short,

812
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,262
I got lucky to have it 'cause
life is an amazing gift

813
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:12,581
When you think about what
you get with a basic life,

814
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,419
Not even a particularly
lucky life or a healthy life.

815
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:18,688
If you have a life,
that's an ama--

816
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,356
Here's your boilerplate deal
with life.

817
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:25,094
This is basic cable,
what you get when you get life.

818
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:27,063
You get to be on earth.

819
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:30,616
First of all--my god--
what a location.

820
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,287
This is earth, and for trillions
of miles in every direction,

821
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:37,373
It fucking sucks so bad.

822
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:41,127
It's so shitty that your eyes
bolt out of your head

823
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:44,247
'cause it sucks so bad.

824
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,583
You get to be on earth
and look at shit,

825
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,385
As long as you're not blind
or whatever it is.

826
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,472
You get to be here.
You get to eat food.

827
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:54,640
You get to put bacon
in your mouth.

828
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:58,978
I mean, when you have bacon
in your mouth,

829
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:02,348
It doesn't matter
who's president or anything,

830
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:07,904
You just--""

831
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,405
Every time I'm eating bacon,
I think,

832
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,526
"I could die right now,"
and I mean it!

833
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,161
That's how good life is.

834
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:16,996
You get to--
you get to fuck.

835
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,165
That's free if you're smart.

836
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,204
That comes with.
That's part of the deal.

837
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,340
Where else are you gonna get
that deal?

838
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:32,995
You get to put your dick
in there and go in and out,

839
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:36,682
Pretty good,

840
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,667
And if you're a woman,
you get to just lay back

841
00:45:38,685 --> 00:45:40,470
And just have a dick

842
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,724
Just shoving
in and out of you awkwardly

843
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,377
Anytime you want,
anytime you want.

844
00:45:55,235 --> 00:45:58,237
If you're a gay man, you get to
just fill your boyfriend's ass

845
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:03,292
With your dick, just fill it
all the way to the balls,

846
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:08,548
And it's nice and warm
and tight in there,

847
00:46:08,582 --> 00:46:11,551
And he's your buddy.

848
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:20,226
If you're a lesbian,

849
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,596
You get to do all the stuff
they're doing, and...

850
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:31,771
It's a great deal.

851
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,356
You get to eat. You get to fuck.

852
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,992
You get to read
"to kill a mockingbird."

853
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,944
It's a great life.

854
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:42,231
So, you know, I'm not worried
about it ending.

855
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:45,535
It's pretty good,
and I've wasted a lot of time

856
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,254
Just being angry at people
I don't know.

857
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:51,958
You know, it's amazing how nasty
we can get as people,

858
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,509
Depending on the situation.

859
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,380
Like, most people are ok
as long as they're ok,

860
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,550
But if you put people in certain
contexts, they just change.

861
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:05,087
Like, when I'm in my car, I have
a different set of values.

862
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:09,725
I am the worst person I can be
when I'm behind the wheel,

863
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:13,062
Which is when I'm
at my most dangerous.

864
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,397
When you're driving,

865
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,532
That's when you need to be
the most compassionate

866
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,951
And responsible of any other
time in your life

867
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:23,239
'cause you are fucking driving
a weapon amongst weapons,

868
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,158
And yet it's the worst
people get, and I am the worst.

869
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,828
One time, I was driving,
and there was a guy ahead of me,

870
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:32,281
And he kind of--I don't know--
sorta drifted into my lane

871
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,717
For a second,
and this came out of my mouth.

872
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,120
I said,
"worthless piece of shit."

873
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,929
I mean, what an indictment.

874
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:50,850
What kind of a way is that to
feel about another human being?

875
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,153
"worthless piece of shit"?

876
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:59,075
That's somebody's son.

877
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,477
And things I've said
to other people.

878
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:03,479
I was once driving, and some guy
in a pickup truck did--

879
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:05,948
I don't remember, even--

880
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:11,320
And I yelled out my window,
I said, "hey, fuck you!"

881
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:16,709
Where outside of a car
is that even nearly ok?

882
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,049
If you were in an elevator

883
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,218
And you were, like, right next
to a person's body

884
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,055
And, whatever, like, he leaned
into you a little bit,

885
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,474
Would you ever turn
right to their face

886
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,610
And go, "hey, fuck you!"?

887
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:43,202
"worthless piece of shit!"

888
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:48,124
No.

889
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:51,327
Literally zero people
would ever do that,

890
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,213
But put a couple of pieces of
glass and some road between you,

891
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:56,966
There's nothing you would not
say to them.

892
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,867
"I hope you die!"

893
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:01,671
I said that to a person.

894
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:04,256
"I hope you die!"

895
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,425
Why? 'cause you made me
go like this

896
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:10,313
For half a second of my life.

897
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:15,985
You tested my reflexes,
and it worked out fine!

898
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,188
So now I hope your kids
grow up motherless!"

899
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:26,278
I mean, what am I capable of?

900
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:32,001
I'd like to think
that I'm a nice person,

901
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,069
But I don't know, man.

902
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:37,256
A lot of it is context.

903
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,592
There's a lot of things I wonder
if the world was different.

904
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:43,746
Like, if murder was legal, I
might have killed a few people.

905
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:45,514
I don't know.

906
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,433
I'd love to think,
"I would never do that,"

907
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:50,269
But we really need the law
against murder

908
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:52,254
For one simple reason.

909
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:54,023
The law against murder

910
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:59,311
Is the number-one thing
preventing murder.

911
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,696
We'd like to think it's 'cause,

912
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,281
Like, "I would never
do that."

913
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:07,236
No. It's 'cause it really sucks
getting caught murdering, a lot.

914
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:13,042
If murder was legal,
or just a misdemeanor--

915
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,877
Like you get a thing
in the mail--

916
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,545
"shit, they had
a camera there.

917
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,798
Well."

918
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:30,726
If murder was legal,
there would be so much murder.

919
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,312
Regular people would murder.

920
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:36,348
Murderers would murder
even more,

921
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,484
And then really nice,
sweet people

922
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:41,136
Would murder a few people,

923
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:45,691
But nobody would murder
no people.

924
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,143
You wouldn't trust somebody
who didn't murder

925
00:50:48,161 --> 00:50:49,578
If murder was legal.

926
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,247
You wouldn't like them.

927
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,665
"I never killed anybody."

928
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:57,453
"ok. Nice meeting you.
Yecch, what a creep.

929
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,455
"I mean, not even a hooker?
Live a life.

930
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,424
"what's wrong with that guy?

931
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,493
He's like a mormon or some shit.
I hate those guys."

932
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,682
"I think he's nice."
"shut up, janet."

933
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:14,804
They would just--

934
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,340
If murder was legal,
there would be a lot of murder.

935
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:21,444
Children would behave
very differently

936
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,780
Because mostly parents would be
murdering their own kids,

937
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,851
That's mostly what would happen
if murder was legal.

938
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:30,536
You know, you'd go to a mall,
there'd be,

939
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,371
Like eight, different moms
in the mall just--

940
00:51:32,405 --> 00:51:37,025
"I told you to stop it!
You didn't listen to me!"

941
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,210
Just--pbbt!

942
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:39,411
There'd be just--

943
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,196
You'd be stepping
over dead kids.

944
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:44,333
There'd be, like, a new problem.

945
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,635
"you have to clean up your kids

946
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,538
"when you kill them
'cause it's gross.

947
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:54,093
"it's bad for the environment.

948
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,978
"if you murder your child
in a public place,

949
00:51:56,012 --> 00:52:01,600
"please use one of the red bags
that are in the dispensers

950
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:07,072
"every three feet of america.

951
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,441
"put your murdered child
in the red bag

952
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,528
"with a logo
of a murdered kid on it

953
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,948
"next to the other logo
that tells you

954
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,869
"not to let your alive kid play
with the plastic bag

955
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,171
"because they might suffocate,

956
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:26,375
In which case you could just
leave them in the bag."

957
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:37,436
That is a whole bunch
of horrible thoughts

958
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,306
Right in a row, right in a row.

959
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:44,092
That is a compressed area
of bad thought.

960
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:49,231
You know, you have
your bad thoughts.

961
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,266
Hopefully you do good things.

962
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:53,369
Everybody has a competition
in their brain

963
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,954
Of good thoughts
and bad thoughts.

964
00:52:54,988 --> 00:52:57,156
Hopefully,
the good thoughts win.

965
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,624
For me, I always have both.

966
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,576
I have, like, the thing I
believe, the good thing--

967
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,879
That's the thing I believe--
and then there's this thing,

968
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:07,883
And I don't believe it,
but it is there.

969
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:11,420
It's always this thing
and then this thing.

970
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,556
It's become a category
in my brain

971
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,625
That I call, "of course...

972
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:19,461
But maybe..."

973
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:27,019
I'll give you an example, ok?

974
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:32,024
Like, of course children
who have nut allergies

975
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,977
Need to be protected, of course.

976
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:37,613
We have to segregate
their food from nuts,

977
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,665
Have their medication available
at all times,

978
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:42,001
And anybody who manufactures
or serves food

979
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:47,957
Needs to be aware of deadly
nut allergies, of course,

980
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,210
But maybe...

981
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,930
Maybe if touching a nut
kills you,

982
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,049
You're supposed to die.

983
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,139
Of course not.

984
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:07,843
Of course not. Of course not.

985
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:09,812
Jesus.

986
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,780
I have a nephew who has that.

987
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,316
I'd be devastated if something
happened to him,

988
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,685
But maybe...

989
00:54:16,703 --> 00:54:19,989
Maybe if we all just do this
for one year,

990
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,125
We're done with nut allergies
forever.

991
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,885
No. Of course not.

992
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:35,203
Of course, if you're fighting
for your country

993
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,706
And you get shot or hurt,
it's a terrible tragedy,

994
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:41,844
Of course, of course...

995
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,214
But maybe...

996
00:54:46,232 --> 00:54:49,518
Maybe if you pick up a gun
and go to another country

997
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:53,322
And you get shot,
it's not that weird.

998
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:57,609
Maybe if you get shot by the
dude you were just shooting at,

999
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,496
It's a tiny bit your fault.

1000
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,843
Of course, of course slavery

1001
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,347
Is the worst thing
that ever happened.

1002
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,887
Listen, listen.

1003
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,890
You all clapped for dead kids
with the nuts.

1004
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:31,860
For kids dying from nuts,
you applauded,

1005
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,729
So you're in this with me now.

1006
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,980
Do you understand?

1007
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,933
You don't get to cherry-pick.

1008
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:41,036
Those kids did nothing to you.

1009
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,208
Of course, of course slavery

1010
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,128
Is the worst thing
that ever happened.

1011
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:51,463
Of course it is,
every time it's happened--

1012
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:53,999
Black people in america,
jews in egypt.

1013
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,001
Every time a whole race
of people has been enslaved,

1014
00:55:56,052 --> 00:56:01,256
It's a terrible, horrible thing,
of course...

1015
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,425
But maybe...

1016
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:07,429
Maybe every incredible
human achievement in history

1017
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:09,648
Was done with slaves.

1018
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:11,650
Every single thing where you go,

1019
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,902
"how did they build those
pyramids?"

1020
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,971
They just threw human death
and suffering at them

1021
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:19,908
Until they were finished.

1022
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,477
How did we traverse the nation
with the railroad so quickly?

1023
00:56:22,495 --> 00:56:24,747
We just threw chinese people
in caves and blew 'em up

1024
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,149
And didn't give a shit
what happened to them.

1025
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:28,667
There's no end
to what you can do

1026
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:31,336
When you don't give a fuck
about particular people.

1027
00:56:31,371 --> 00:56:35,323
You can do anything.

1028
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,492
That's where human greatness
comes from,

1029
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:41,847
Is that we're shitty people,
that we fuck others over.

1030
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:45,050
Even today, how do we have
this amazing microtechnology?

1031
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,935
Because the factory
where they're making these,

1032
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,220
They jump off the fucking roof

1033
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,856
'cause it's a nightmare
in there.

1034
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,608
You really have a choice.

1035
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,526
You can have candles and horses

1036
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:56,344
And be a little kinder
to each other

1037
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:59,364
Or let someone
suffer immeasurably far away

1038
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:01,733
Just so you can leave
a mean comment on youtube

1039
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:06,071
While you're taking a shit.

1040
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:10,192
Thanks a lot, folks.
You guys were great.

1041
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:12,661
Thank you very, very much.

1042
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,913
Thank you.
