00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:13,326
It's always something that's spoils it.

186
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,159
You know what I'm saying?

187
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,810
I'm trying to have some fun.

188
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,643
Fuck.

189
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,150
How the hell we get lost anyways?

190
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,740
You know, why don't you ask somebody?

191
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,850
I looked at the damn map!

192
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,299
Is it a man thing?

193
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:26,370
No, it's not a man thing!

194
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,450
It's just not my damn fault, okay?

195
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,035
It's gonna take us forever to get home.

196
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,822
Look at this cracker with this sister, man.

197
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:32,048
(men chatting in the distance)
Hey, yo!

198
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:32,881
Hey, yo, cracker!

199
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:33,713
Hurry it up.

200
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,777
Smack the shit out your cornbread ass, nigga.

201
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:37,260
That motherfucker look like a scarecrow.

202
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,320
Look at that motherfucker.

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,602

00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,436
Hey, yo!

205
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,570
What's up, white boy? You lost?

206
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,270
What you're doing in a black neighborhood, cracker?

207
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,020
This aint your fucking neighborhood.

208
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,924
Hey, yo. He lost like Dorothy, or something.

209
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,165
What you doing with a sister any, fucking, way?

210
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:51,419
(man grumbling)
Huh?

211
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,728
Oscar Meyer Weiner.

212
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,060
Like you can give her what the fuck she needs.

213
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,280
Funny, real funny.

214
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,073
Just shut up, okay?

215
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:57,906
Okay, just.
No,

216
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:58,739
what the fuck are you talking?

217
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,860
You lost.
Cause you're gonna

218
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,693
get us killed!

219
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:01,582
I'm not gonna get us killed. What the fuck's he gonna do?

220
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,948
Yeah, I want some beef! All right?

221
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:06,198
(upbeat hip hop music)

222
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,650
(people yelling in the distance)

223
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,702
Fuck you, motherfucker.
(men yelling)

224
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,990
Come here, motherfucker.

225
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,073
Come here.
Motherfucker.

226
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,089
(birds chirping)

227
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,411
(upbeat funky music)

228
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:43,646
Morning.

229
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:44,479
Morning.

230
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,928
Oh god, finally!

231
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,980
I have an apartment in New York.

232
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,400
How's it feel?

233
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,363
Good, I guess.

234
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,210
Better than the Y.

235
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,253
Got a lot of boxes down there.

236
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:00,840
It's gonna take us forever to unpack.

237
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,334
It's gonna take you forever to unpack.

238
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,850
What do you mean, me?

239
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,683
Us.

240
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,270
You know I have to meet with producers.

241
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,610
You know I have to take care of business.

242
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,560
I gotta get my deal. You know all this.

243
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,453
Yeah.

244
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,723
(man sighing)
Yeah, I do.

245
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,079
♪ When I heat up this shit ♪

246
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,724
♪ You would swear is was Auschwitz ♪

247
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,858
♪ Crying over this like Schindler's List ♪

248
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,753
♪ Cause the game's about hating and waiting ♪

249
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,586

250
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,046
Yo, man.

251
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,644
What's the plan, man?

252
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,190
You know what the plan is, man.

253
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,085
Disciple coming to town.

254
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:37,918
Yeah.

255
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,250
We gotta start recruiting motherfuckers, man.

256
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,019
Rather looking forward to that.

257
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,046
You know what I'm saying?

258
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:42,879
Gotta start organizing.

259
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,580
I take care of that. Don't worry about it.

260
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,413
Yeah.
Aint nothing.

261
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:47,201
What's gonna be what, man?

262
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:48,793
What about that cat Khaleel though?

263
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,947
What about Khaleel?

264
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:53,893
You know he's a knucklehead, man.

265
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,020
You know Disciple don't want no knuckle heads

266
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,230
in the camp, man.
Yeah.

267
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,138
It seem like he'd be a part of one of us though.

268
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:01,971
He one of us.
He can be

269
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,250
with the right upbringing, man.

270
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,157
But we just gotta see what Disciple want,

271
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,603
and see if he want him in.

272
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:09,501
'Aight.

273
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,800
And with the right training, he could be tight, man.

274
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,308
(loud drumming)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

275
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,808
(man singing)

276
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:21,503
Come on, New York City!

277
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:24,788
Show me some love!

278
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:29,788
(loud drumming)
(man singing)

279
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,359
You know, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

280
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,192
Stop.
We aint here

281
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,025
for our health.

282
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:44,858
You gotta give us quarters now.

283
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:45,691
A coin!

284
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:46,524
I aint got any money.

285
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:47,620
American Express, Visa, Mastercard?

286
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,453
You guys are good though.

287
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:49,780
Come on, man.
Not gonna give it up.

288
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,613
We good though, huh?

289
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,000
That's all I get, Captain?

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
Thanks a lot!

291
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,860
You better watch out, brother!

292
00:11:56,938 --> 00:12:00,480
(drumming)
(bells chiming)

293
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,900
See how I be hooking you up, girl?

294
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,452
Hey, what's up darling?

295
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:04,396
Hey.
Hey, baby.

296
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:05,785
Mwah, how you doing boo?

297
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:06,618
All right.
I'm cool.

298
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,190
Damn, Donna. Who's your fine ass, friend?

299
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,841
Who she be with?

300
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,680
(woman chuckling)
Her name is Debbie.

301
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,640
She's my girl.

302
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,000
And she be with Tony Mispelli.

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,210
Tony Mis-what?

304
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,992
Oh, you must talk bout them Italians, right?

305
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:20,523
(group giggling)

306
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:21,875
You so stupid!
I mean,

307
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,708
think about it.

308
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,720
She can't check a brother out?

309
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,690
Look at me. You know what I'm saying?

310
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,970
I got it going on.

311
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,060
Sit the hell down.

312
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,534
Why y'all gotta keep being so damn stupid?

313
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,831
Cause they can.
Damn.

314
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,664
Know what I'm saying?

315
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,320
I understand what you're saying.

316
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,520
Believe me. Okay?

317
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,740
And I'm not saying that it's been a whole bed of roses,

318
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,190
or anything.

319
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,696
We have our problems just like everybody else.

320
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:42,658
Look, you need to shut up girl.

321
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,906
You ain't got to air your business in front of everybody.

322
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,490
I'm gonna be real with all y'all,

323
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,334
I'll be the first brother in line to pull me a white girl.

324
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:50,899
A fine one too.

325
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,400
And I don't have no problem taking her out from time to time

326
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,290
because I'm gonna be sexing her, from time to time.

327
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,260
Bring it home to my mom's?
(man exhaling)

328
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,740
Hell no, that shit ain't happening.

329
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,737
No way. No how.

330
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,770
I know my parents want me to marry a black man.

331
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,890
I mean, plain and simple.

332
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,090
My daddy would beat my ass

333
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,024
if I brought home a Brandon or Brett.

334
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:13,857
I mean, think about it.

335
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:15,920
Generations of generations of being slaughtered,

336
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,753
and all that.

337
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:17,650
You know what I'm saying?

338
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,213
You ask me, to me it's payback.

339
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,109
(man chuckling)

340
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:21,942
You know what I'm saying, dog?

341
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:22,821
Y'all are gonna help me prove my point.

342
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,490
This is exactly what I was talking about before.

343
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,117
Yeah, I know. Pass me the grease.

344
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:29,400
All I'm saying is, a man is a man. Okay?

345
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
And if I, as a black woman,

346
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,950
meet and like a white guy,

347
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,477
and he treats me with respect, I'm going out with him.

348
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:37,730
And so you should.

349
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,563
Yeah.

350
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,367
(calm R&R music)

351
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,200
(thunder roaring)

352
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,699
Babe.

353
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:47,532
Hmm?

354
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:48,502
(woman giggling)

355
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,056
Hey.

356
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:50,889
What?

357
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,840
Do you love me?

358
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:56,500
(man chuckling)
Yes. I love you.

359
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,333
Don't be silly.

360
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,563
I mean, do you really love me?

361
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,830
Yes. I really love you.

362
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,477
Now can I go back to sleep?

363
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,040
(woman giggling)
No.

364
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Tell me why.

365
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,853
Oh god, it's one of your Little Women moments?

366
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,412
No. Come on.

367
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:18,245
Hmm,

368
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,193
let me see.

369
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,950
I think I love thee,

370
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,253
because of your nice,

371
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,823
beautiful face, and lips, your nose,

372
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,153
your eyes.

373
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,103
Now, I think I love you because of your ears.

374
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,137
(woman laughing)

375
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,578
And because you're ticklish!

376
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,093
(woman laughing)
No! No!

377
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,896
Stop it.
No!

378
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,199
Who's your daddy, huh baby?

379
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,345
Who's your daddy?

380
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,598
What are you talking about?

381
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:55,181
I said, who's your daddy?

382
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,446
(woman giggling)
Get away from me.

383
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,867
Who's your daddy?

384
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:58,830
(woman laughing)
Who's your daddy?

385
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,663
Okay!

386
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,884
You're my daddy.
Yes, I am.

387
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:02,967
Okay! Okay!

388
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:07,667
Yeah!
(woman laughing)

389
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,700
Check it out.

390
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,003
She's a finey, man.

391
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,710
Ah, I'm taking though.

392
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,610
That was some great work last night, man.

393
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,687
That was some funny stuff.

394
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,487
You do a lot of comedy in Bean Town?

395
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:22,269
You know, when I could.

396
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,340
I was able to get certain plays in, you know,

397
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,920
and I got some good reviews.

398
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,060
And actually Debbie,

399
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,010
the girl you met me with last night,

400
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,959
she kind of helped talk to me into coming out here,

401
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,792
you know?

402
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,090
I took a leap of faith.

403
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,923
That's fine, man.

404
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,033
I like her a lot, but,

405
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,980
I might even go as far as saying that I love her.

406
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,750
She's definitely gonna help me get

407
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,930
to where I need to go too.

408
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,763
Yo, check it out!

409
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:44,400
There she goes again, man.

410
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,000
50 bucks, but either way, she's fine.

411
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,160
You're sick.
(man laughing)

412
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,530
It's about doing something positive

413
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,400
and locking it down out here, you know what I mean?

414
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,085
We need some strong brothers like you running with us.

415
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,219
Word up.
I'm down.

416
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,283
You know what I'm saying?

417
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,460
And don't get me wrong, B,

418
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,730
we aint on no racist shit neither, yo.

419
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,130
Don't go out here, start wiling and getting it twisted.

420
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,963
You know what I'm saying?

421
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:09,220
We just on some strong black, strong brother, shit.

422
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:12,964
We need you down with us, you know what I mean?

423
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:13,797
Aight.
We about

424
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:14,630
running this shit out here.

425
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,630
We need to lock it down.

426
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,463
Yo, man. I'm gonna come tonight

427
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:18,030
fill out some papers, man.

428
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,543
Yo, do that. We'll do that.

429
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,376
All right?
Thanks, man.

430
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:22,903
Yeah. I've been trying to reach you for weeks.

431
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,270
Yeah, I'm here.

432
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,470
I'm here. I'm here in New York and, yeah,

433
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,303
I'm all excited.

434
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:31,860
I mean, I'm kinda looking forward to kinda

435
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,030
taking care of all the business,

436
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,160
and get this deal all put together.

437
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,750
I'm really.
(slow instrumental music)

438
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,583
What?

439
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,315
You're kidding me.

440
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,130
No, but see, no.

441
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,400
Do you remember?

442
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,273
I came all this way from Boston.

443
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,773
No, I came here, no.

444
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,010
No, I don't understand now,

445
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,700
but is there anything else we can do?

446
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,450
I mean, there's gotta be somebody else, or another way?

447
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,613
All right. Well, call me if anything changes.

448
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:17,251
Yeah.

449
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:20,534
Yeah.

450
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:21,367
Okay. Bye.

451
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:24,488
Fuck.

452
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:33,276
(woman sighing)
Shit.

453
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,148
(upbeat hip hop music)
Today,

454
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,380
is a good day.

455
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,810
Introducing the new members to the New Black Revolution,

456
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,026
Khaleel and his crew.

457
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:45,780
The white man's time is over.

458
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,850
He can't kill black leaders like he used to.

459
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,130
The devil that walks the street from today on,

460
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,384
will be hit by a rude awakening.

461
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:54,217
(horn honking)

462
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:56,062
Get ready for the revolution.

463
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,150
I'm no longer part of the problem,

464
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,213
I'm part of the solution for the black men.

465
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,570
They're telling you it's a good picture, but,

466
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,940
darling, I'm gonna be frank with you.

467
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,840
Tony, I really don't think our agency

468
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,810
has any place for you right now.

469
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,207
You need to take some voice lessons.

470
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,550
(woman laughing)

471
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,383
Oh my god.

472
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,780
All you've got is a telephone number on the back.

473
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,120
I also see that you're not a member of any of the unions.

474
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,953
What union?

475
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,380
Do you have any tape that I could take a look at?

476
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,530
Go away. Okay?

477
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,363
Listen, why don't you go home,

478
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:24,310
come back in a year.

479
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,482
Take a year, come back and see me again.

480
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,184
I mean, I have no idea how you got in my front door.

481
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:32,267
(upbeat funky music)

482
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,645
(phone dialing)

483
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,565
Hey, I got some Kool-Aid.

484
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:50,065
Hey!
Thank you!

485
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:52,777
So, what did he say?

486
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:54,349
Who you calling, mom?

487
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,670
Getting ready to try and call your sister.

488
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,520
Why bother?

489
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,480
She never calls us back.

490
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,980
Because I gotta keep reaching out for her.

491
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,730
Gotta give her unconditional love, like Jesus gives us.

492
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,037
You just gotta love her.

493
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,995
And just reach out.

494
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,560
(upbeat R&B music)

495
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,580
Girls! What ever happened to crooners

496
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,800
that used to make your heart cry?

497
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,190
Like Marvin Gaye!
Oh god!

498
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,090
What's going on?

499
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,260
Oh, mercy, mercy.
(woman giggling)

500
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,743
I can't believe you still have all this stuff on vinyl!

501
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,073
Rita, Stevie.

502
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,220
Those are the people who made me want to

503
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,500
get in this business in the first place.

504
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,867
I mean, they was really singing,

505
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,763
and they had to be funky!

506
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,350
Like, when I listen to my Shaka Khan.

507
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,183
Yeah, girl.

508
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,890
Rather, my Prince. Oh! Oh!

509
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,422
I mean, The Artist.

510
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,380
(woman chuckling)

511
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,291
He's the bomb though!

512
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,876
There really are some really good singers out there.

513
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:56,810
And you know what I'm talking about,

514
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,640
but there are some out there,

515
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,570
that are strictly on the hype, and the look.

516
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,430
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

517
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,442
You know what I'm talking about.

518
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:06,410
The thing that gets me though is that

519
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,060
I'm busting my butt, going to every late night jam,

520
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,780
and singer showcase in town.

521
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,110
Really perfecting my craft.

522
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,710
I have respect for the music.

523
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,320
While you got these other girl groups,

524
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,790
don't know a thing about music.

525
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,860
They're making all the money.

526
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,450
Look, been there, done that.

527
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,650
And the t-shirt wasn't all that cute either.

528
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,080
But no, no seriously.

529
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,760
I know you are gonna be just fine.

530
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,510
And don't you worry about all these no-talents

531
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,343
that's coming up,

532
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,910
because what you have, is what God gave you.

533
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,390
And nobody can take that away from you.

534
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,845
Yeah.
So you know what?

535
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:39,743
You're gonna be fine.

536
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,200
Not that it matters, but I need to make some real money.

537
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,455
Hey, girls.

538
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:46,721
I really thought he was gonna hook you up, you know?

539
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:47,970
Mind if I join you, Dylan?

540
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,660
Tony, Seth. Seth, Tony.

541
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,493
How you doing?

542
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:52,730
Yeah. How you doing?

543
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,790
Hey, so what's up with the firm, huh, bud?

544
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,493
Pretty good, man.

545
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,170
Had my best, first quarter yet.

546
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,820
Yeah, I'm on a fucking roll.

547
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,060
I just got another promotion.

548
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,462
Puts me at a six figure base, man.

549
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm on my way. I'm a fucking King!

550
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
That's great, man.

551
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,650
Hey Tony, what do you do?

552
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,630
Oh, he's in the entertainment industry.

553
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,083
You know, TV, film.

554
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,840
He also manages some up and coming talent.

555
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,920
Yeah, pretty slick.

556
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,620
You must get laid like crazy, huh?

557
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,309
Yeah. I do pretty good, yeah.

558
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:23,142
Do you know what you'd like to order?

559
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:24,460
Would you like a menu, sir?

560
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,393
Menu.

561
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,170
Stupid bitch.

562
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,940
How was she a bitch?

563
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,060
Well, of course I wanted a menu. She's giving me attitude.

564
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,090
You're the one who gave her attitude.

565
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,923
She's doing her job.

566
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:38,300
So what's the deal, sport?

567
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,230
You like her, or something?

568
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,530
Hey.
I don't have to like her.

569
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,850
Hey, guys, come on.

570
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,710
We're all friends here.

571
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,020
It's fine. I just didn't know your buddy here

572
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,853
likes niggers.

573
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:48,235
You know, it's fucks like you

574
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:49,230

575
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,431

You know,

576
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:51,364
if you're a nigger-digger, that's fine with me.

577
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:53,642
I just think it's kind of fucked up myself.

578
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:55,559
Get your fuck face outta here.

579
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,840

580
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,321
Hey, hold up Tony. Wait up!

581
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,154

582
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:02,268

It's just business, man.

583
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:03,267
We met years ago.

584
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:04,100
Can't stand Jew fucks like him

585
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,530

586
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,940

You know what I mean.

590
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:12,780
I got nothing against Jewish people.

591
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,750
It's just that it seems like no matter how much I try,

some fuck head like him,

593
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,360
or it could be a girl, talking about some stupid

594
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,750
cause I'm white and she's black.

595
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,760
They got a fucking problem.

596
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
I can't stand that!

597
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,940
So sick of it!

598
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,400
I'll say, you know, maybe we should stop trying so hard.

599
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,630

726
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,120
What's up? What's going on?

727
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,028
Carl's in the hospital.

728
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:25,859
In the hospital?

729
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,176
What you talking about he in the hospital?

730
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:28,009
What didn't you call me?

731
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,009
I'm sorry.

732
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,033
What happened?

733
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,496
(upbeat electronic music)
Tony, Tony,

734
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:37,846
entre vous, sil vous plait.

735
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,270
Why'd you come so far to see me?

736
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,580
What's the problem?

737
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,950
It's Debbie. She's stressing out, she's frustrated.

738
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,540
It's affecting out relationship!

739
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,630
You guys need some money? You got financial problems?

740
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,053
No, no, I don't need any money.

741
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,982
I'm here for her.

742
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,581
You know, she's been with you what now?

743
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:57,414
For five, six months,

744
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,110
and every time she sings, she brings down the house.

745
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,170
You know, Debbie's got all the talent in the world.

746
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,390
She's got the right stuff.

747
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,060
The other girls are getting deals,

748
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
and they don't even have half of what she has.

749
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,040
Look, these aint our schmucks.

750
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,822
They don't know the real thing when they got it.

751
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:10,700
They're a bunch of idiots.

752
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,750
Tony, I've been doing this gig for a lot of years,

753
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,030
if she's got the kind of stuff,

754
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,360
that's gonna bring her to the top.

755
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,280
Princess, tell him. Tell him.

756
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,740
Believe me. You can trust him.

757
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,040
Listen, I do whatever you want.

758
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,990
You got my word.

759
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,670
Rocco's word. And Rocco's word is good.

760
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,570
He will do whatever he needs to help Debbie out.

761
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,410
Listen, thanks Rocco.

762
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,066
I just wanted to like, come by and tell you what's going on,

763
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,411
and,
(man sighing)

764
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:36,992
Tony.
Thanks a lot.

765
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:37,825
Toodles, Tone.

766
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:40,173
Stop, Rocco!

767
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,332
(kiss smacking)
I can't help myself.

768
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:44,493
This one, he about this far away.

769
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,748
Talk about, I want you to make me look like Oprah.

770
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:50,239
I was like, how many years you got, mamma?

771
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,853
Why don't we just go with what you got?

772
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,871
What you got, which wasn't much.

773
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:56,173
But that's all right though. That's aight.

774
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,578
That's so cool to be a client, you know?

775
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,838
Nah!
I aint got no hair.

776
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,266
I need my hair done.
Oh!

777
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,753
About five seconds on your hair for free, hello?

778
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:07,172
What's up, Debbie? How you doing?

779
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,087
I'm doing fine. How are you?

780
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,750
You're looking good.

781
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,533
Oh, by the way, Bridget, Debbie.

782
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,120
Debbie, Bridget.

783
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,573
And, uh,
Donna.

784
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,072
Oh, you forgot our names now.

785
00:30:20,072 --> 00:30:21,455
Ah.

786
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:22,560
I remembered your name.

787
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,231
See you looking good in that showcase the other night.

788
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,297
Thank you.

789
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:27,130
She was fly.

790
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,270
It was all that.
No doubt.

791
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,103
No doubt.

792
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,160
Aight, I'm gonna get up out of here though.

793
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,833
It's nice seeing you though.

794
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:34,690
Okay.
Have a good one.

795
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,048
Have a good set!

796
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:36,881
Aight.

797
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,025
See y'all later.

798
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:38,858
Uh huh.

799
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:41,688
Lil leap frog. What was that?

800
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:42,830
Bud.

801
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,969
Weis.

802
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:47,616
Er!
(women laughing)

803
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:48,780
Who was all this about?

804
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,290
Mr. Mack-a-liscious, dog!

805
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:54,779
(upbeat R&R music)

806
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:55,612
Is that one for you?

807
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,403
Sure.

808
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,190
Hey, how you doing?

809
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,019
Mike, what the hell you doing here?

810
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,460
Don't be so happy to see me.

811
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,260
Hey, by the way, how'd Carl feeling?

812
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:09,150
You know damn well how.

813
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,393
That's why I'm here.

814
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:11,810
I want you to send them him regards.

815
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,700
Make sure you do.
After all

816
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,900
he did for you, Mike!

817
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,540
How could you do this to him, man?

818
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,373
This is black call, jack.

819
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,206
All he did for me?

820
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,260
Look at all this talent I sent him.

821
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,320
Three Reasons?

822
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,600
Well, there were two.

823
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,056
I made 'em three.

824
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:22,889
Listen, listen.

825
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:24,399
Man, why don't you just get the hell out of my studio!

826
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,249
Easy, you're getting yourself all riled up now.

827
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:27,526
By the way, you look nice.

828
00:31:27,526 --> 00:31:28,359
All right, listen,

829
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,192
just do me a favor.

830
00:31:29,192 --> 00:31:30,740
Make sure you send him my regards,

831
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,190
and when this, Real Soul, when it falls

832
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,240
I give you three reasons you come work with me.

833
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,403
You're a snake, Mike!

834
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:44,055
(papers rustling)

835
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,369
Take it from the bridge.

836
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:51,286
(upbeat R&R music)

837
00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:55,484
(upbeat club music)

838
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,067
Open up the door, bitch!

839
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,571
Who is it?
Man, open

840
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:14,313
the god damn door, give us your shit.

841
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:17,313
(upbeat club music)

842
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,404
Where'd you fucking go, man?

843
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:23,092
Who's the bitch now? Let's go!

844
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:24,731
Romeo! Romeo!
(men yelling)

845
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:27,003
Calm down, son. It's Khaleel!

846
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:29,310
It's Khaleel. Calm down, son.

847
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,143
It's me, man.

848
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,644
Harlem from back in the days.

849
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:34,810
Ta da!

850
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,861
(man laughing)
Man, you crazy?

851
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,101
I almost stuck your ass.

852
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,147
Yeah, yeah okay. I'll let you tell it, man.

853
00:32:41,147 --> 00:32:42,570
(man sighing)
Romeo,

854
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,770
What's the deal, yo?

855
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,060
I got to find out from some hoe

856
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,760
that my partner's back home?

857
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,533
You know I's got to just come here and fuck with ya.

858
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:51,525
Hey.

859
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:55,144
(man sighing)

860
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,743
Man. After I finished up that two year bit,

861
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,600
I was like, fuck the bullshit, man.

862
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,835
There's too many young niggers out there shooting shit up

863
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:06,100
for no reason.

864
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,250
Yo, so I went around the state,

865
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,690
singing and shit.

866
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,440
Spent some time in Europe.

867
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,450
I'm trying to get a record deal.

868
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,450
Yeah, I hear that.

869
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:17,490
My man always had the singing skills to pay the bills.

870
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,150
Always had on some fine ass, sisters.

871
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,053
Ah! Just like a regular Marvin Gaye.

872
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,909
Yeah. I'm with that.

873
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,760
(man chuckling)

874
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,843
Yeah. So what's up with the gears, yo?

875
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,750
Like y'all ready for war and shit.

876
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,030
I'm glad you asked, my brother.

877
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,833
War's exactly what we all about.

878
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,920
We're taking over where the Black Panthers left off,

879
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,830
only we taking it a little further.

880
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,130
Ain't that right, black soldiers?

881
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,963
Yeah.
Yeah.

882
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:47,880
We are all members of the New Black Revolution.

883
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,850
This brother, named Trevor,

884
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,523
turned me on to the organization.

885
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,350
I've always hated white people.

886
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,580
Ever since I was in a third grade,

887
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,520
this big, white non-sun taking cracker

888
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,883
just stomped the shit outta me.

889
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,010
Whipped my ass bloody.

890
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,600
Just because I helped this little,

891
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,230
blonde haired, blue eyed girl get up.

892
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,893
Cause she was beat up by her brother and his friends,

893
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,483
telling me I'm just a dirty little nigger,

894
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,053
and I should know my place.

895
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,793
I got the medicine for that madness.

896
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,389
You down with the program, or what?

897
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:32,186
Man.

898
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,728
Man, it's too extreme for me.

899
00:34:35,728 --> 00:34:36,760
(man chuckling)

900
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,466
That's cool. I ain't gonna fuck with you.

901
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:40,570
I know you ain't no joke.

902
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,683
I'll keep in touch.

903
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:43,893
Yeah.
All right?

904
00:34:43,893 --> 00:34:44,726
All right, bro. Peace, man.

905
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:45,560
Let's go, soldiers!

906
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:50,322
I'm starving! Let's go sit down somewhere.

907
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,491
Can we go?

908
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,300
Eat where?

909
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,860
The Indian restaurant that we passed?

910
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,693
That one was cute.

911
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:57,530
I like that one.

912
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,363
With what?

913
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,470
Well, don't you have any money.

914
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:05,210
No, I paid the rent.

915
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,860
Besides, what do we have to go out to eat for?

916
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,163
I mean, why don't you try cooking for a change?

917
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,351
You know?

918
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:15,952
You know.
(woman scoffing)

919
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:16,785
Whatever.

920
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,530
What? You can't cook now?

921
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,457
One minute!

922
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,398
(woman sighing)

923
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:30,530
Hey, girl.
Hey!

924
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,730
What's happening?

925
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,520
Uh, just trying to hook this place up.

926
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,087
Whoa!

927
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:35,920
Yeah!

928
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,753
This is gonna be hard. Can I help?

929
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:37,870
Put me to work!
You sure can.

930
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,020
Take your little self over there.

931
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,080
I'm fixing the chair, get the materials,

932
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,150
and get a paintbrush.

933
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,983
Yeah, girl.

934
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,960
You see, I've been working, right?

935
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,310
Yeah.

936
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,870
I am so tired.

937
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,500
Man, this feels good right here.

938
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,943
Just even sitting on this hard ladder.

939
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,318
(women chuckling)

940
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,750
All I need right now is a massage,

941
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,230
a glass of wine, and a good man,

942
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,120
with dinner ready. And this place cleaned up!

943
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,210
Amen.
Girl,

944
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,640
what are you amening about?

945
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,960
You got a man,

946
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,433
and a cute one too.

947
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,453
And a cute one too!

948
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,973
Hello? Is anybody home?

949
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,220
What's wrong with you?

950
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,820
Is everything okay?

951
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,933
Yeah. No, I don't know.

952
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:29,492
We've been fighting a lot lately.

953
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:31,600
(upbeat hip hop music)

954
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,800
I don't know, but you're so caught up in this girl.

955
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,867
I love Debbie and everything,

956
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,220
and she's so talented, but it's like, hey,

957
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,710
take a step back, dude.

958
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,620
Take a look at yourself

959
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,641
and see how this is ruining your life.

960
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,080
This girl, this girl has got you lost.

961
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,690
She said you all tied up and confused.

962
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,370
I think you losing sight at why you came here

963
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,630
in the first place.

964
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,314
I'm tired of never having any money.

965
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:52,570
I'm always broke.

966
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,997
I don't have money for clothes.

967
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:56,477
For food. For me. You know?

968
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:58,350
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

969
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:01,139
You know what?

970
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:03,146
I know what you should do.

971
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:04,630
What?

972
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,923
Get a damn job!

973
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,510
Go make it happen.

974
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,850
You gotta find yourself again, man.

975
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,730
Get refocused.

976
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,750
Easy for you to say, you know,

977
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,583
you're the one with the money.

978
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,435
You have nine to five, okay?

979
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,346
I have no fucking money.

980
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:17,820
I don't believe he said that.

981
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,810
What makes you so special?

982
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,783
It's like my career, you know?

983
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,590
Do what I have to do.

984
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,280
How am I supposed to get a record deal?

985
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,310
By working that much harder at it, Debbie.

986
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,100
You know what, how Tony puts up with you,

987
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,933
I will never know.

988
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:32,766
He puts up with me

989
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:34,830
because that is the deal that we may coming here.

990
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,310
At least just starting out.

991
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,540
Right. And that was when you first got here?

992
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,960
When you thought you had a record deal?

993
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,930
Debbie.

994
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,820
I made a promise to her, and to me.

995
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,130
We're gonna make this happen.

996
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,020
There's a whole lot of people out there

997
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,860
that wanna see me fail.

998
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,120
So I go back to Boston, like a,

999
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,250
like a cry baby.

1000
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,760
Oh the big actor didn't make it.

1001
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,150
The big actor didn't make it.

1002
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,650
Well you know what, I'm not gonna let that happen.

1003
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,530
I had too much fucking pride.

1004
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,966
Wait a second.

1005
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,360
What ever happened to Tony the actor?

1006
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,220
That's not my fault producers lied to me.

1007
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,930
That's not the point, Debbie.

1008
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,690
I mean, the point is Tony is working his off

1009
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,950
trying to support both of you

1010
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,410
working as an extra two days a week,

1011
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,470
doing this whole bike messenger thing.

1012
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,350
I mean, look, Lord knows you deserve to make it. You do.

1013
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,330
But until then,

1014
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,135
Debbie, if you love him.

1015
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:21,526
I don't know.

1016
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:24,080
I think I do, sometimes.

1017
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,440
And other times I can't stand the sight of him.

1018
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,970
Yeah but, all couple go through that.

1019
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,797
That's the whole, couple thing.

1020
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:30,970
That's just called a relationship.

1021
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,850
That's all that is. I mean, you know, it's work.

1022
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,040
That's all a part of it.

1023
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,190
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I need to do

1024
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,160
to make this happen.

1025
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,440
I don't know what it is gonna be yet,

1026
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,370
but it's gonna happen.

1027
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,890
See, that's the spirit!

1028
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,510
That's the determination.

1029
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,450
Yo know, it's not all about her.

1030
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,310
It's about you too.

1031
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,350
I'm gonna figure something out.

1032
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,790
See, that's the old Tony.

1033
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,550
That's the Tony that I know.

1034
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,980
Come on, man.

1035
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,406
Let's go get some margaritas or something.

1036
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:56,560
How'd you get to be such Miss Know-It-All?

1037
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,152
No, it's not about me being Miss Know-It-All.

1038
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:01,978
Although, I do know a lot of stuff.

1039
00:39:01,978 --> 00:39:02,811
(woman laughing)
But,

1040
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:04,290
it's about me being my sister's keeper.

1041
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,810
Okay? You're my girl.

1042
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,160
I got to look out for you.

1043
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,129
You know what? I would expect you to do the same thing.

1044
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:12,712
You know I will.
You better.

1045
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:16,417
Listen, it's not personal.

1046
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,017
I like this man, you understand?

1047
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,701
Real Soul does not selling labels down.

1048
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:22,643
Listen, listen,
No.

1049
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:23,476
All you gotta do is,
No, no, no.

1050
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:24,610
It's going down, man. Okay?

1051
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,240
This is a personal decision.

1052
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,793
Passion is paying. That's where I'm going.

1053
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,552
It's been beautiful, brother.

1054
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:32,563
Give my regards to Carl.

1055
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,890
What's going on, baby? What's he talking about?

1056
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,430
What this guy?
Isn't he your top

1057
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,080
A&R guy?

1058
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,413
What's going on?

1059
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:44,520
I just got problems right now.

1060
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,807
I didn't wanna say anything to you.

1061
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:47,649
(man sighing)

1062
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:49,221
We really got our hands full.

1063
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:51,221
Got this deal going bad.

1064
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:54,984
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1065
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,796
(slow bass music)

1066
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:03,129
Fucking bills.

1067
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,249
(man sighing)

1068
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:07,916
Bills, bills, bills.

1069
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:10,610
Paul Loupin, how the fuck do you

1070
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,760
keep getting mail here?

1071
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:25,187
Credit card.

1072
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,678
(restaurant chatter)

1073
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,030
Debbie, so what's the deal with you and that guy

1074
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,888
I saw you with?

1075
00:40:35,888 --> 00:40:37,821
You mean Tony, my boyfriend?

1076
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:40,620
My man?
Oh, your boyfriend.

1077
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,320
You guys don't look too happy together, if you ask me.

1078
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,580
Called a relationship.

1079
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,463
Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's down.

1080
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,840
Why don't you give me your number?

1081
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,711
Maybe I'll call you sometime we can hang out.

1082
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:55,660
(woman giggling)

1083
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,563
Talk music.

Yeah, I'll think about it.

1087
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,010
Think about it.

1088
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,074
Girls are always thinking about it.

1089
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:11,105
Why you gotta think about it?

1090
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,313
(man sighing)

1091
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:15,630

(upbeat hip hop music)

1104
00:42:15,597 --> 00:42:16,898
The time is now, man.

00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:18,345

00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,250

Yo, word up, son. Man, fuck that black shit.

1111
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,256
We need to be trying to get paid.

1112
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,090
Paid.
Need that money.

1113
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,492
You know what's killing me?

1114
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:32,210
I'm feeling you 100% Khaleel, but,

1115
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,683
according to everything I love,

1116
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:35,460
your shortie's half Jewish.

1117
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,620
So all his pro black shit you talking,

1118
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,453
means nothing.

1119
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:42,263
Your sister aint so much of a sister, bro!

1120
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:43,986
Hold it down!
That son.

1121
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:47,934
(upbeat hip hop music)

1122
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:50,601
(phone dialing)

1123
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,020
Money is always tight.

1124
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,060
Bills and not getting paid.

1125
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,340
But it's other stuff too like,

1126
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,580
I am so sick of brothers calling me a sellout.

1127
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,940
Like I'm supposed to be afraid of their stuff.

1128
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,980
Now, you know, they think they got the bomb stuff, right?

1129
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,389
You know, it's like grow the fuck up.

1130
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:11,222
(woman laughing)

1131
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:12,580
Or what's even worse is when sisters,

1132
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,490
sisters, get all up in my face.

1133
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,190
Tell me I should be ashamed of myself.

1134
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,672
You should be used to that by now.

1135
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:20,538
That's not cool.

1136
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:21,793
I'm not trying to hear that anymore.

1137
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:22,807
I know you aint.
No.

1138
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:24,233
I know how black I am.

1139
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,040
And I don't need a black man to make me a black woman.

1140
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,580
That's what your mouth say?

1141
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,993
Oh, you better go, soul sister!

1142
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:32,826
Mm.

1143
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:34,220
Although, some of these brothers

1144
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,960
are looking fine as hell.

1145
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,163
Uh, you care to name names?

1146
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:39,982
No!

1147
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:41,050
You know what, I know where this is coming from.

1148
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,950
I know exactly what you're talking about.

1149
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,515
Oh, Romeo. Oh, Romeo.
You're wrong.

1150
00:43:45,515 --> 00:43:47,493
Oh, Romeo. Oh, Romeo.

1151
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:48,367
Oh, Romeo!
Stop it!

1152
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:50,985
See, you're lucky I let you do my hair!

1153
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:51,875
Oh, Romeo!
I'm gonna hit you!

1154
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,625

1155

1156
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:07,332
Come on.

1157
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:12,167
What's wrong?

1158
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:14,167
You know what's wrong.

1159
00:44:17,274 --> 00:44:18,731
What you mean? What'd I do?

1160
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:20,480
Exactly what I needed your ass to do.

1161
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,113
Now you gots to fucking go, hoe.

1162
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:25,716
What are you trying to say?

1163
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:27,829
Get the fuck out, stupid!

1164
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:30,480
Yeah, well, I can't go home with too late!

1165
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,960
I told my boyfriend I was gonna be at my girlfriend's.

1166
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,010
Don't talk about your boyfriend. Get the fuck out!

1167
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,100
You got white man's blood

1168
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,378
going through your fucking veins!

1169
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:40,028

00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,030
I'm sorry.

1264
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,887
Then what are you doing here?

1265
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:35,522
I've been asking myself the same question.

1266
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:37,143
You know I wrote a song about us.

1267
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,763
About you actually.

1268
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:42,963
A love song.

1269
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,740
I just couldn't finish it.

1270
00:50:49,204 --> 00:50:50,037
At first I thought it was

1271
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:52,100
because I was trying to rush the song too quick.

1272
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,740
But as I got to know you,

1273
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,080
I realized that no matter what line I used on you,

1274
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,833
no matter how smooth I tried to be still be,

1275
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:06,971
you'd still be with him.

1276
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:12,689
I don't know what to say.

1277
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:20,162
I'm sorry.
(man sighing)

1278
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,490
But you know what?

1279
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,240
Maybe this time I'll let you slide.

1280
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,560
But next time,
(woman giggling)

1281
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,603
I'm not gonna be so lenient on you.

1282
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,790
Thank you for understanding.

1283
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,240
Thanks for being a friend.

1284
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,973
I can't believe I can't find anybody.

1285
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,560
In this big city, I can't find one person.

1286
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,880
Maybe you somebody on the label,

1287
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,740
that you've already signed?

1288
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,320
I can't use anybody on the label.

1289
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,790
Even Sabotage. I can't use anybody there.

1290
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:52,623
And how about the girl

1291
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:54,720
you said you heard a couple of weeks ago at that club?

1292
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,040
What girl?

1293
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,190
I dunno know. You said you sounded like an angel,

1294
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,023
or something.

1295
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:02,153
Wait a minute. Where was I? Um?

1296
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:05,897
What girl was that?

1297
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:07,010
I dunno. Downtown?

1298
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,210
Rocco's! Rocco's.

1299
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,440
Baby, you are,

1300
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,450
you are the bomb. You know that?

1301
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,283
Am I?
You are

1302
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:14,484
a woman. I'm telling you!

1303
00:52:14,484 --> 00:52:15,710
(woman giggling)
Every time I'm down,

1304
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,010
you think of something.

1305
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,213
Cause I'm your baby.

1306
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,384
You know where I'm gonna take you,

1307
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:23,112
when I sign this girl?
Where?

1308
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:24,260
I'm thinking right now.

1309
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,450
Think, Jamaica.

1310
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,450
You see any sand, girl?

1311
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,860
Think the Bahamas.

1312
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,930
What?

1313
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,320
Think Bermuda.

1314
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,811
It's getting hot!

1315
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:33,231
Think Jamaica.
It's getting hot in here,

1316
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:35,215
baby.
Antigua.

1317
00:52:35,215 --> 00:52:37,497
Oh, you working for that, aint you?

1318
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:40,247
(woman laughing)

1319
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,410
Donna's friend, Hassan.

1320
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,110
He just got a big movie deal,

1321
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,420
just because he did a showcase.

1322
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,010
Those showcases, they're bullshit!

1323
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,060
It's a scam!

1324
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,470
You have to give them like, 300 bucks.

1325
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,040
So you go see these big agents,

1326
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,200
and he's big casting directors,

1327
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,170
you give them your money.

1328
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,490
They put in their pocket,

1329
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,390
you give the performance of a lifetime.

1330
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,160
Every single ounce of blood, sweat and tears

1331
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,393
you have inside you.

1332
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,310
And what do they do?

1333
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,300
They clap like a bunch of fucking seals, like this.

1334
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,380
And they go home with our money in their pocket.

1335
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,931
A couple of hundred dollars richer.

1336
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:13,870
Pathetic.

1337
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,720
Don't get mad at me. I didn't make the rules.

1338
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,653
It's not my fault.

1339
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,533
Okay. Let me tell you for a second

1340
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:19,366
what I'm going through.

1341
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,220
I know all too well what you go through.

1342
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,590
I've known it for six months,

1343
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,710
since we've moved here!

1344
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,390
Since you were supposed to be a big star!

1345
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,520
You haven't been doing anything.

1346
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,353
I've been doing.

1347
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:29,290
I've been the one doing, doing, doing.

1348
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,123
And you know what? I'm sick of it.

1349
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:30,956
I'm sick of struggling.

1350
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:32,560
I want my piece of the pie.

1351
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,403
That's why I,

1352
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,863
That's why, what?

1353
00:53:38,472 --> 00:53:39,305
What?

1354
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:41,500
That's why I got these fucking credit cards

1355
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,630
to pay for your fucking clothes and your stereo!

1356
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,463
I'm sick of it!

1357
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,966
Tony. What is this?

1358
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:50,820
Nevermind what the fuck it is.

1359
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,500
It's paying our way, all right?

1360
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,530
It's paying our way!

1361
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,052
It's for you.
(woman arguing)

1362
00:53:55,052 --> 00:53:56,500
It's for your TV.

1363
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,617
It's for your friends!
You're gonna

1364
00:53:57,617 --> 00:53:59,482
get us put in jail!

1365
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:00,315
You out of your mind?

1366
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:01,260
No, I'm not out of my mind.

1367
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,780
Yeah! Maybe I am of my fucking mind!

1368
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,020
And you know what?

1369
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,100
I'm getting out of here.

1370
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,180
This is what you call taking care of business?

1371
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,267
Well, what have you done?

1372
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,100
This is how you're gonna get?

1373
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,933
What have you done?

1374
00:54:10,933 --> 00:54:11,843
You tell me what you've done around.

1375
00:54:11,843 --> 00:54:12,676
I'm the one that's out there

1376
00:54:12,676 --> 00:54:13,900
trying to get us someplace!

1377
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,220
You aint getting us shit!

1378
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,600
I'm out there busting my ass!

1379
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,447
Everybody's,
Stolen credit cards?

1380
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:19,970
That's not busting your ass!

1381
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,533
That's a free meal ticket, man.

1382
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,380
You knew what we were getting into

1383
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,099
when you came here!

1384
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,030
I thought we came on here together.

1385
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm out here by myself,

1386
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,060
and you're along for a free ride.

1387
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,425
A free ride!

1388
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:34,069
And I'm sick of it!

1389
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,902
Jesus!

1390
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:38,938
(door slamming)

1391
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:40,273
Fine!

1392
00:54:40,273 --> 00:54:41,106
Fine!

1393
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,913

I know you are here to hear the man of the hour.

1418
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,970
But your United States government

1419
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,897
would like to stop this brother.

1420
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:06,760
But they cannot kill black leaders

1421
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,340
like they used to.

1422
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,653
Welcome the Black Revolutionary leader, Disciple.

1423
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,930
Welcome my brothers and sisters.

1424
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,180
Thank you all for coming.

1425
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,737
The governor and the mayor of the city

1426
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:24,450
are so worried and in fear of us,

1427
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:27,170
they are so preoccupied about the $13 billion

1428
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,690
that tourists spend in the city,

1429
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,800
eating at our hotels,

1430
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,870
sleeping in our beds,

1431
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,660
and buying their Broadway shows,

1432
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,810
they won't even speak to the real citizens.

1433
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,293
It is time for you,

1434
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,894
the real people,

1435
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:42,094
the true people, to stand up and be counted.

1436
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,372

Debbie,

1439
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:00,530
what did you think he was doing?

1440
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,270
You had to know something.

1441
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,560
How do you think he was paying the bills

1442
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,530
by working as an extra two days a week?

1443
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,000
Or working as a bike messenger.

1444
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,480
I don't know! I didn't expect him to do this.

1445
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,590
You know,

1446
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:11,423
you think you know somebody,

1447
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,320
he turns into a criminal.

1448
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,917
I didn't expect it!

1449
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:15,350
I should've known, maybe,

1450
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,592
he was supposed to handle, I don't know.

1451
00:57:17,592 --> 00:57:18,719
You know, that was his stuff.

1452
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:19,990
I don't know.
Okay.

1453
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,823
Where is he now?

1454
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:24,573
Here I am, New York!

1455
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,653
You're not gonna beat me!

1456
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,823
You're not gonna beat me!

1457
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:34,823
(man yelling)
You're not gonna beat me!

1458
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,058
(upbeat funky music)

1459
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,870
Yo, what's up Captain?

1460
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,833
Yo, Captain! Where your lady at?

1461
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,340
Is this all you fucking do,

1462
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,080
every single day of your life?

1463
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,010
Heckling people?

1464
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,160
All you sit and do is ask for money,

1465
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,137
and you fucking complain!
Relax.

1466
00:58:16,137 --> 00:58:17,420
I'm not gonna relax!

1467
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,100
And you piss and you moan!

1468
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,173
I got no money!

1469
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:22,690
(man yelling in frustration)

1470
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,553
Just trying to help you out, brother.

1471
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,447
White people.

1472
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:35,619
Tony, where are you?
(dramatic string music)

1473
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:37,953
(woman sighing)

1474
00:58:37,953 --> 00:58:42,953
(crowd cheering)
(announcer calling)

1475
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:44,040
My team not gonna win, man.

1476
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,211
The other team is gonna win.

1477
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:47,490
It's not gonna win!

1478
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,323
So what's up?

1479
00:58:49,603 --> 00:58:52,070
I got one step better than three reasons, baby.

1480
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:52,903
What?

1481
00:58:52,903 --> 00:58:54,643
Debbie Lewis.
Debbie,

1482
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:55,476
never heard of her.

1483
00:58:55,476 --> 00:58:56,360
Untouched secret. I'm telling you,

1484
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,430
this girl is hot.

1485
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,460
Are you sure?

1486
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,427
My main concern is Carl.

1487
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:04,160
I don't want Carl coming out of this deal

1488
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,470
looking like an ass.

1489
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,280
Carl gonna look like a champ, baby.

1490
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,490
I'm talking Muhammad Ali.

1491
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,940
This kid is gonna be shining.

1492
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,279
Come on, have I ever let you down?

1493
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,280
Not, but what's this freak name?

1494
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,944
Debbie Lewis is gonna shine. I'm telling you.

1495
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:17,855
Come on.

1496
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,845
Let me do this, aight?
You sure?

1497
00:59:19,845 --> 00:59:24,845
(crowd chatting)
(announcer calling)

1498
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,740
And who are you?

1499
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,530
Rocco, my name is Oliver Cross.

1500
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,720
I worked for Carl Davis over at Real Soul.

1501
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,400
Carl Davis! Carl Davis.

1502
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,390
Come in.

1503
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,910
The son of a gun. I haven't heard that name forever.

1504
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,570
Princess, would you get Mr Cross,

1505
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:48,206
please, get him a refreshing drink.

1506
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:49,039
Won't you, dear?

1507
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,338
Attitude. Attitude.

1508
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,633
Mr. Cross. How is the old war horse?

1509
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,050
He's in the hospital.

1510
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,060
What happened? His ticker?

1511
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,893
Exactly.

1512
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,710
He's been under a lot of stress lately.

1513
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,503
Thanks.

1514
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:11,490
What, with the new film division and everything.

1515
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,130
But what did him in was recently signing

1516
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,370
this new, girl group.

1517
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,170
We shelled out millions for them.

1518
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,240
Apparently, the girls,

1519
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,340
they're bust.

1520
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,773
What? They can't sing?

1521
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,500
Put it this way,

1522
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,000
you wouldn't mistake them for one of The Supremes.

1523
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,630
And what schmuck had this brilliant move?

1524
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,580
A guy named Mike Espo.

1525
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,760
You're shitting me?

1526
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,850
You know him too?

1527
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,780
Rocco knows everyone who's anybody.

1528
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,830
After all that Carl did for him?

1529
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,450
That in the closet, SOB.

1530
01:00:44,824 --> 01:00:46,993
The question is, how can I help you?

1531
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:51,483
Well, the reason for me coming by tonight is,

1532
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,150
well, I think I might have,

1533
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,910
rather, you might have the solution to this whole mess.

1534
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,960
What does Rocco have that can help you?

1535
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,953
Debbie Lewis.

1536
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,963
Kid, you're the fucking balls.

1537
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,613
Brilliant. That's great.

1538
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:16,420
Here's what I have in mind.

1539
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:19,272
(phone ringing)

1540
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:23,060
(calming piano music)

1541
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,371
Hello?

1542
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:25,204
Debbie?

1543
01:01:25,204 --> 01:01:26,301
Mama?

1544
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,670
I'm so glad to hear you, baby.

1545
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:29,733
I've been trying to get you.

1546
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:30,880
Is everybody okay? What's the?

1547
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,010
Oh honey, I miss ya so much.

1548
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:33,843
Are you okay?

1549
01:01:33,843 --> 01:01:35,420
Do you need anything?

1550
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,470
I'm fine, mama.

1551
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,680
I'm fine.

1552
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,104
Is there something you want?

1553
01:01:39,104 --> 01:01:42,180
Yes, honey. I love you very much,

1554
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,040
and I miss you even more.

1555
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,580
Please read your Bible.

1556
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,243
Mama. Don't start.

1557
01:01:48,194 --> 01:01:49,124
I know. I know.

1558
01:01:49,124 --> 01:01:51,120
There's lots that we have to talk about.

1559
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,330
Mama, I'm sorry.

1560
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,410
Debbie.
I gotta go.

1561
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,170
Don't hang up right now.

1562
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,140
There's some things I need to tell you,

1563
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,644
but I wish you would come home.

1564
01:01:58,644 --> 01:01:59,477
I'm late.
Need to

1565
01:01:59,477 --> 01:02:00,310
talk to you face to face.

1566
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,550
I don't have time to talk now.

1567
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,900
I know you're in a rush, honey, but,

1568
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,340
I'm sorry.

1569
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,400
I can't talk now.

1570
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,401
Okay.
I gotta go.

1571
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:08,907
I'll call you again.

1572
01:02:08,907 --> 01:02:09,950
I love you.

1573
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,150
If you need me,
Me too.

1574
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,808
Okay.
Bye, mama.

1575
01:02:12,808 --> 01:02:15,349
I'll call you again.
Bye!

1576
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:18,432
(somber piano music)

1577
01:02:22,693 --> 01:02:23,526
Fuck.

1578
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:35,147
Come on, Debbie.

1579
01:02:35,147 --> 01:02:35,980
Pick up.

1580
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:43,607
Where the fuck are you?

1581
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:48,280
(loud drumming)
(man singing)

1582
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,483
What's up, young lady?

1583
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,700
What's happening? Remember me?

1584
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,070
What's going on?

1585
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,080
How you doing? Where's the Captain?

1586
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,140
What's happening? What's the matter?

1587
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,010
You ain't got no money?

1588
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:58,890
You ain't got no smile?

1589
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,863
You can't speak. What's wrong with you?

1590
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,050
Come on, man. What you doing, man?

1591
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,443
Still trying to play that Amadeus shit?

1592
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,699
Yo, man. I'm chilling, yo. I'm chilling.

1593
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:11,532
That's all, man.

1594
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:12,560
Listen up.

1595
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,410
The president's in town tonight.

1596
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:15,930
We have another rally.

1597
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:19,070
We fit we'll go rattle his tight, white, lying ass.

1598
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,013
You down with it?

1599
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,970
Yo man, you in to something that satisfies you.

1600
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,750
That's cool, man.

1601
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,833
But I ain't there.

1602
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,833
No disrespect.

1603
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,310
Just on some other shit right now, yo.

1604
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,230
No disrespect taken.

1605
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,160
But you say that now,

1606
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,960
wait till a telephone company disconnects

1607
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,853
your harmonizing ass.

1608
01:03:39,872 --> 01:03:43,750
(man laughing)
(guitar strumming)

1609
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:48,370
I mean, I know this fucking, thick as black bitch, man.

1610
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,728
Yo, come on. What you bugging for, man?

1611
01:03:50,728 --> 01:03:51,670
Hey, yo, man. She was protecting that

1612
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,113
fucking devil on the platform, man.

1613
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,770
Debbie. Yo, what you talking about?

1614
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,603
What happened?
Yo, man.

1615
01:03:57,603 --> 01:03:59,710
She was with this fucking white boy, son.

1616
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,960
I was gonna put a bullet in that

1617
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,120
fucking devil's temple, man.

1618
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,370
You should've seen him.

1619
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:05,203
Thinking he was all that

1620
01:04:05,203 --> 01:04:06,793
cause he had himself a sister.

1621
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,460
Yo, where can I find her Romeo?

1622
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,430
Yo, I don't know where she's at, man.

1623
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:15,030
She used to work at this club where I sang at,

1624
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,120
but I heard she left town.

1625
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,920
Yo, Romeo, we cool and everything,

1626
01:04:18,878 --> 01:04:19,779
but don't even try to play me

1627
01:04:19,779 --> 01:04:22,360
like a deck of fucking cards on this one, son.

1628
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,695
That's all I know, man. That's all.

1629
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:25,528
(guitar strumming)

1630
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,050
Have you seen her?
(upbeat funky music)

1631
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,020
Yeah. Okay, call.

1632
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,853
Call back.

1633
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,330
I need you to call me.

1634
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,410
Yeah, call me as soon as you hear anything,

1635
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,294
and I mean anything!

1636
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,290
Look, this is important to me!

1637
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,183
Rocco doesn't ask for much!

1638
01:04:44,183 --> 01:04:46,490
Rocco doesn't ask for much!

1639
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:49,033
Yo, Damien. Where's Debbie?

1640
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,023
I'm saying. I'm looking everywhere for her, man.

1641
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:56,210
(man sighing)
Come on, Damien.

1642
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,350
I need you to help me with it.

1643
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,183
I got it, man.

1644
01:04:59,183 --> 01:05:01,492
I'm going down to the lounge right now.

1645
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:02,325
All right?

1646
01:05:02,325 --> 01:05:03,390
But I was thinking about the show, man.

1647
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,223
Come on, Damien.

1648
01:05:04,223 --> 01:05:06,060
You know the rap doesn't fly with this show.

1649
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,520
I need you Damien. I need you to find Debbie. Okay?

1650
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,270
You helped me find Debbie,

1651
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:12,330
I see what I can do for you.

1652
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:15,407
Just three minutes, man. That's all I'm asking for!

1653
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:17,213
Do this for me. I'll try. Okay?

1654
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,170
All right, bro.

1655
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:26,897
Princess!

1656
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,112
Princess!

1657
01:05:29,112 --> 01:05:32,362
(upbeat hip hop music)

1658
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,693
Tell him.

1659
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:41,643
Tell him what you told me.

1660
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:45,043
Yo, Trevor. Khaleel bugging the fuck out, man.

1661
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:48,230

01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:49,500

01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:56,913

1667
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:01,410
Y'all, Disciple warned this nigger before he left, yo.

1668
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:03,540
Yo, T&T! Jay!

1669
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,630
Yo, Bird. Come here, yo.

1670
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,110
Y'all want you to find this big head, motherfucker, man.

1671
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,000
Let's slow his roll, yo.

1672
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,730
Deal with it. Handle that.

1673
01:06:14,648 --> 01:06:15,890
Before it get outta hand.

1674
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,440
You making us look bad, fellas!

1675
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:22,230

1676
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,570
Hey, Hey, Anthony! How you doing?

1677
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,296
Get against the wall.

1678
01:06:25,296 --> 01:06:26,975
Remember us?

1679
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:28,874
You lose something?
You remember?

1680
01:06:28,874 --> 01:06:29,707
Fuck.

1681
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:30,593
You're under arrest.

1682
01:06:30,593 --> 01:06:33,343
(low bass music)

1683
01:06:37,044 --> 01:06:37,877
Fuck.

1684
01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:39,844
Anthony. Where'd you think you were going?

1685
01:06:39,844 --> 01:06:40,677
You're in some deep shit, buddy.

1686
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:42,693
Let's get this perp outta here.

1687
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:44,003
What? You rob half of New York?

1688
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:47,880
(siren wailing)
That's a nice coat, Anthony.

1689
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,770
Whose credit card use that? Huh?

1690
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,070
How many New Yorkers you've been ripping off,

1691
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:51,903
huh, buddy?

1692
01:06:58,269 --> 01:07:00,029
(knocking on door)

1693
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:01,614
Donna?

1694
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:02,447
Hey, girl.

1695
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:06,688
Donna, please.
Oh god.

1696
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,687
I can't open this door in the middle of the night.

1697
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:11,653
Hey, girl. I'm sorry. Tony's in jail.

1698
01:07:12,631 --> 01:07:14,343
Oh God. Come in, come in. Okay.

1699
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:21,010
I'm going crazy.

1700
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,750
I waited all day by the phone to hear something from him.

1701
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,080
I've been trying to reach you all day.

1702
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,354
I waited for you to get home.

1703
01:07:27,354 --> 01:07:28,660
I mean, I don't have any money for bail.

1704
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,930
Okay.
He's all I got.

1705
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,853
Just calm down. Just calm down.

1706
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1707
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,150
You know what?

1708
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:41,983
Now I can't,

1709
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:42,990
I can't promise anything,

1710
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,757
but there's this lady, I do her hair.

1711
01:07:44,757 --> 01:07:46,260
Her name is Ms. Thompson,

1712
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:49,593
and her husband is like this big time, major lawyer.

1713
01:07:50,556 --> 01:07:51,389
(woman gasping)
And listen.

1714
01:07:51,389 --> 01:07:52,380
No, no, no, no, no, listen.

1715
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,779
I can't promise you anything.

1716
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,717
But if I can find her number, maybe I can give her a call

1717
01:07:57,717 --> 01:08:00,564
and you know, maybe her husband can help out or something?

1718
01:08:00,564 --> 01:08:02,640
Oh god, Donna. Anything. Anything at this point.

1719
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,970
Anything.

1720
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:06,610
Thank you.
(woman sighing)

1721
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,620
Okay. Let me go do that.

1722
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,574
I'll put on some water for tea, okay?

1723
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:12,407
Okay.

1724
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:15,153
You're my angel, you know that?

1725
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,865
(woman sighing)

1726
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,033
Hey, Deb! Deb, I found the card!

1727
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:33,527
Deb! I found the.

1728
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,977
Oh girl, you're tired.
(woman sighing)

1729
01:08:43,977 --> 01:08:45,023
Get some rest, girl.

1730
01:08:47,611 --> 01:08:49,303
Get some rest.
Thanks, mama.

1731
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:01,857
(woman sighing)

1732
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:09,600
(phone ringing)
Hey, yo,

1733
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,434
just give me a minute.

1734
01:09:10,434 --> 01:09:11,970
Hold on. Mr Cross?

1735
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:12,970
Rocco's on the line.

1736
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:15,210
Yo, Rocco. What's up?

1737
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,778
Yeah, where is this girl, man?

1738
01:09:18,778 --> 01:09:20,452
Come on. We gotta find her.

1739
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:22,582
Right, but you know this is what Carl would want.

1740
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,960
Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know.

1741
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,440
You feeling any better?

1742
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,300
No, I fell terrible.

1743
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,370
I know you must be feeling pretty bad

1744
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,473
to be calling me mama.

1745
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,306
What?
I know

1746
01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:35,620
I don't look that bad in the middle of the night.

1747
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,040
What are you talking about, Donna?

1748
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,300
You called me mama.

1749
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,290
I was like, now, I outta slap this.

1750
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,122
(woman laughing)

1751
01:09:42,122 --> 01:09:43,241
I do not look like her mommy.

1752
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:44,880
No, I'm sure I was dead asleep,

1753
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,620
and I didn't mean anything by that. I am sorry.

1754
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:51,200
Well, now, okay I'm ready to get into your business, okay?

1755
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,338
But, you don't talk about your mom that much.

1756
01:09:54,338 --> 01:09:55,513
What's that about?

1757
01:09:55,513 --> 01:09:56,610
No.

1758
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,823
That is a sore subject.

1759
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,660
She was just really, really, really over-protective,

1760
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,760
and very heavy handed.

1761
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,210
Always preaching about, mmm, gotta go to church,

1762
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,907
and do this. You gotta do what I say.

1763
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,475
Don't be singing that worldly music.

1764
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,059
You know, I was like,

1765
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:17,120
finally, I grew up, and I realized,

1766
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,330
I had to be me. So I left.

1767
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,640
Well now, I can relate to you wanting to be you.

1768
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,430
But, here's my humble opinion,

1769
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,650
going to church doesn't sound like a bad piece of advice.

1770
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,751
I mean, you need Jesus anyway.

1771
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:34,027
There you go. You sound like my mama.

1772
01:10:34,027 --> 01:10:36,236
No, hey, I aint your mommy.

1773
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:39,800
I know. I know.

1774
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,933
Look, all seriousness,

1775
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,900
I don't know how long it's been

1776
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,280
since you've spoken to your mother,

1777
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,643
but you might want to reach out to her.

1778
01:10:48,643 --> 01:10:51,317
I mean, you know, tomorrow's not promised to anybody,

1779
01:10:51,317 --> 01:10:52,913
and you just never know.

1780
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,059
You never know, Deb.

1781
01:10:56,059 --> 01:10:57,440
Doing some ill shit, man.

1782
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,430
That's not where were coming from.

1783
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,900
Yo, man. It's like this man.

1784
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,140
We got everything on lock down.

1785
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,760
The black organizations, the black schools,

1786
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,115
but I'm not letting the white man get away with nothing.

1787
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:09,260
That still stands, man.
Fuck all that bullshit, man.

1788
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:11,840
I told you from door, we aint on no racist shit, man.

1789
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,470
We on some pro-black shit, man.

1790
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,470
You on some triple-black shit.

1791
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,480
Yeah, but that white man is still our enemy, man.

1792
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,260
He has to die, man.

1793
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,309
He has to die?
That's shit, man.

1794
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,610
Some straight bullshit.

1795
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,850
I'm gonna tell you like this,

1796
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,460
you making our organization look bad, B.

1797
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,293
And on top of that,

1798
01:11:26,293 --> 01:11:28,140
you making me look bad in front of my disciples.

1799
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,557
I bought you in, and you fucking up, man.

1800
01:11:30,557 --> 01:11:32,130
I want the white man dead.

1801
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,080
Fuck that. I'm out.

1802
01:11:35,846 --> 01:11:37,013
It's no use.

1803
01:11:38,201 --> 01:11:41,284
(upbeat funky music)

1804
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,580
Hey, baby.

1805
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,474
It's going. Hey, good seeing you baby.

1806
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:49,367
How you doing?

1807
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:50,200
All right. How you doing?

1808
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,033
Good.

1809
01:11:51,033 --> 01:11:51,866
How's the label doing?

1810
01:11:51,866 --> 01:11:52,900
All right.

1811
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,540
Christina, could you excuse us please?

1812
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,073
All right. I'll see you later

1813
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:56,906
All right. I'll talk to you,

1814
01:11:56,906 --> 01:11:57,739
Talk to you. Take it easy, all right?

1815
01:11:57,739 --> 01:11:58,900
Take care.
All right.

1816
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,940
So baby, what happened? What's going on?

1817
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,550
I can't find this girl anywhere.

1818
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,790
I mean, I've been looking all over the city.

1819
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,960
I mean, every major club.

1820
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,227
Nobody can find her.

1821
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:15,001
Man, I gotta do this for Carl. I have to do this.

1822
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:17,793
Oh, baby. They called from the hospital,

1823
01:12:19,997 --> 01:12:21,750
and, Carl's not getting any better.

1824
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:22,880
(man sighing)

1825
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,380
That's all I need right now.

1826
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,620
Listen, you gotta pull yourself together.

1827
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,330
Listen, we'll get through this.

1828
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,130
You hear me? We'll get through this.

1829
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,452
You will find her.

1830
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,513
We'll get through this.

1831
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:37,542
I'm here for you.

1832
01:12:38,925 --> 01:12:39,758
I know.

1833
01:12:41,577 --> 01:12:43,136
You're the man.

1834
01:12:43,136 --> 01:12:44,215
(man chuckling)

1835
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:45,564
That's why I got you.

1836
01:12:45,564 --> 01:12:46,897
And I got you.

1837
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:53,840
Hey Debbie, I got your message.

1838
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,631
I was on my way to the hair show. What's wrong?

1839
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,131
I know you were.

1840
01:12:57,977 --> 01:13:00,367
What's the matter?

1841
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:01,710
My mother, is so sick.

1842
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,583
I think she might be dying.

1843
01:13:04,553 --> 01:13:05,386
Oh my god, Debbie.

1844
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:10,333
She refuses to go to the hospital. I don't know.

1845
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,750
Well, I mean you, you going,

1846
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,480
you are going to see her? Right?

1847
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,250
I don't know.
You have to go.

1848
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,796
What's your problem?

1849
01:13:17,796 --> 01:13:19,080
(woman sighing)

1850
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,223
The showcase.

1851
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:22,090
Tony.

1852
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:23,510
Look, Debbie. Okay. Look,

1853
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:26,142
you know I'm dealing with Mr and Mrs. Thompson so,

1854
01:13:26,142 --> 01:13:27,197
I mean, I can take care of Tony.

1855
01:13:27,197 --> 01:13:28,190
And the showcase,

1856
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,464
I mean, you know that's always going to be there,

1857
01:13:30,464 --> 01:13:31,620
but believe me, you are not gonna be able

1858
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,370
to forgive yourself if you don't go see your mother.

1859
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,380
We don't get along. I don't have any money.

1860
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:39,079
Look, Debbie, Debbie. Listen to me.

1861
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:39,912
You don't have to worry about money,

1862
01:13:39,912 --> 01:13:41,740
but you have to go see your mother.

1863
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,210
You gotta get your priorities together.

1864
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,570
Girl, that showcase is always gonna be there.

1865
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,540
And I mean, whatever is gonna be yours,

1866
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,137
is yours regardless. Nobody can take that from you.

1867
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,250
You cool? I mean, cause we can do this.

1868
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:55,866
Okay. Come here.

1869
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:57,099
We need to make reservations. You gotta go now.

1870
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,050
Okay.

1871
01:13:58,050 --> 01:13:59,780
So I got this group coming in from Virginia.

1872
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,360
I got Sandy from Cleveland.

1873
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,490
She's definitely gonna get signed.

1874
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,090
I mean this girl, she is hot.

1875
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,271
You know, she's gonna get signed.

1876
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:06,104
I'm really excited about this.

1877
01:14:06,104 --> 01:14:07,579
Gonna have a good time. Gonna be wonderful tonight.

1878
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:09,167
We're gonna pull this, man. I'm telling you.

1879
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,805
Debbie Lewis, I'm so glad to finally meet you.

1880
01:14:12,805 --> 01:14:14,153
Debbie, where the hell have you been?

1881
01:14:15,046 --> 01:14:17,073
Uh, I got some bad news.

1882
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,043
Bad news?

1883
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,990
I'm not gonna be able to make the showcase.

1884
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,680
Oh, you don't know what I've been through for you.

1885
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,760
I know.

1886
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,250
I'm sorry. I gotta go out of town.

1887
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,610
I have a family emergency.

1888
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:31,720
I need more of an explanation than that.

1889
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,570
What's happening?

1890
01:14:34,038 --> 01:14:34,888
It's my mother.

1891
01:14:36,362 --> 01:14:37,850
I thinks she's dying.

1892
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,260
I'm sorry.

1893
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,870
You know, as soon as I get back,

1894
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,257
maybe we work something else out?

1895
01:14:42,257 --> 01:14:45,180
I have a record deal on the line for you tonight.

1896
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,313
You better get your priorities straight.

1897
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,280
You know what?

1898
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,540
I do have my priorities straight.

1899
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,350
That's why I gotta go.

1900
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:55,800
See you around, Rocco.

1901
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,952
Nice to meet you.

1902
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:04,359
It's gonna be okay.

1903
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:10,543
(calming instrumental music)

1904
01:15:10,543 --> 01:15:13,293
(birds chirping)

1905
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:36,833
Hi, mama.

1906
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:45,325
Mama's been praying for you to come home.

1907
01:15:45,325 --> 01:15:46,325
I'm sorry.

1908
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:55,336
I'm sorry.
(women crying)

1909
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:03,836
I'm glad you came.

1910
01:16:03,836 --> 01:16:06,503
(phone ringing)

1911
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:08,530
Hello?
Hi.

1912
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,870
Mom.
Tony?

1913
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,480
Tony, is that you?

1914
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,620
Where are you?
Gimme the phone.

1915
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,285
Wait, wait.

1916
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:15,118
Let me talk to Tony.

1917
01:16:15,118 --> 01:16:16,410
Yeah, you're doing okay?

1918
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,387
Yeah, I'm sorry I called.

1919
01:16:21,561 --> 01:16:22,894
It's been a lot.

1920
01:16:24,152 --> 01:16:25,169
I'm sorry it took my so long.

1921
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,248
It's okay. It's all right.

1922
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,040
I just wanted to tell you how much I love you.

1923
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,329
I know.

1924
01:16:33,329 --> 01:16:37,239
And I'm sorry. Forgive me for being so tough on you.

1925
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:39,977
I know I've been wrong.

1926
01:16:39,977 --> 01:16:43,644
Please remember, keep god with you, sugar.

1927
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:45,417
I will.

1928
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:46,737
Anything that you ask,

1929
01:16:48,059 --> 01:16:49,059
and believe,

1930
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:51,900
it'll be yours.

1931
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:57,773
I promise I will.

1932
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:02,486
I'm not ready for you to go yet.

1933
01:17:02,486 --> 01:17:04,711
I'm not ready for you to go yet, mama.

1934
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:05,882
It's okay.

1935
01:17:05,882 --> 01:17:07,260
It's too soon!

1936
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,427
I get to sing for Jesus.

1937
01:17:11,372 --> 01:17:14,458
You remember that old song you used to sing,

1938
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,791
when I was five?

1939
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:18,664
Every times.

1940
01:17:18,664 --> 01:17:20,081
That's the one.

1941
01:17:21,057 --> 01:17:22,890
I wanted to give in,

1942
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:27,866
times I thought life

1943
01:17:30,588 --> 01:17:32,255
wasn't worth living.

1944
01:17:35,123 --> 01:17:38,986
But that still, small voice whispered.

1945
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:43,013
You can make it too.
You can make it too.

1946
01:17:43,013 --> 01:17:43,846
Somehow.

1947
01:17:45,364 --> 01:17:47,733
I'll always made it through.

1948
01:17:50,493 --> 01:17:52,720
It's a slow, uphill climb.

1949
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,753
Reaching for the top.

1950
01:17:59,827 --> 01:18:04,827
And when I get there,
(women whispering)

1951
01:18:05,798 --> 01:18:07,748
But that still, small vice whispered,

1952
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:10,207
you can make it too.

1953
01:18:12,156 --> 01:18:12,989
Mama?

1954
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:16,220
No, mamma, please.
(woman crying)

1955
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,323
Stay with me, mama.

1956
01:18:19,372 --> 01:18:20,205
Please.

1957
01:18:23,256 --> 01:18:24,734
No.

1958
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:29,446
No!
(woman crying)

1959
01:18:29,446 --> 01:18:34,446
(somber piano music)
(radio chatter)

1960
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,155
(firefighter calling out)
Another arson?

1961
01:18:44,155 --> 01:18:46,294
(upbeat hip hop music)

1962
01:18:46,294 --> 01:18:47,127
Yo, we need to talk.

1963
01:18:47,127 --> 01:18:48,653
We need to talk.
Hey, yo,

1964
01:18:48,653 --> 01:18:49,856
what's up, man?

1965
01:18:49,856 --> 01:18:52,010
Hey, we need to talk. We ain't doing no more fights, man.

1966
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:53,504
That was the last one.

1967
01:18:53,504 --> 01:18:55,210
Yo, let me tell you something, like I said before, man.

1968
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:57,530
Fuck the cycle, man. That shit is weak.

1969
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,950
Hey, yo, we aint doing no more fighting.

1970
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:02,091
You're too close to home, yo.

1971
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:03,439
You still here, wanna fucking fight,

1972
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:05,154

1973
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:05,987
Hey, cut this shit out, man.

1974
01:19:05,987 --> 01:19:08,320
I aint letting no more fucking chinks

1975
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,923
sell shit in our neighborhood no more, aight?

1976
01:19:09,923 --> 01:19:12,723
If they at in block 40, fucking with some dental floss,

1977
01:19:12,723 --> 01:19:14,450
they get bullets in they fucking head.

1978
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,662
Hey, yo. Fuck that. That's it, yo.

1979
01:19:16,662 --> 01:19:17,632

True soldiers, man.

1980
01:19:17,632 --> 01:19:20,737
Hey, yo, we outta this shit, man.

1981
01:19:20,737 --> 01:19:21,570
Hey, yo, we out.
We out.

1982
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,809
Come on, man.

1983
01:19:22,809 --> 01:19:23,760
Yo, man. Fuck that.

1984
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,256
Be true, black soldiers, man.

1985
01:19:26,256 --> 01:19:27,380
You're supposed to be down with the black,

1986
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,915
fucking crew, man!

1987
01:19:28,915 --> 01:19:31,545
The black revolution, man! What's up?

1988
01:19:31,545 --> 01:19:32,813
Y'all supposed to be down with me

1989
01:19:32,813 --> 01:19:35,181
and the true, black revolution.

1990
01:19:35,181 --> 01:19:36,431
What's up, man?

1991
01:19:39,562 --> 01:19:44,562
(horns honking)
(upbeat hip hop music)

1992
01:19:46,012 --> 01:19:49,012
(upbeat jazz music)

1993
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:56,171
Did you hear from her?

1994
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:57,004
No, not yet.

1995
01:19:57,004 --> 01:19:58,463
She probably still thinks I'm locked up.

1996
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,296
She's probably just going to be freaking out.

1997
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,877
You in jail, and the whole deal with the mom.

1998
01:20:01,877 --> 01:20:03,173
She'll be okay.

1999
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,123
We'll be okay.

2000
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,330
Once she gets back up here,

2001
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,290
we're gonna make a right.

2002
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:10,123
No more jail shit.

2003
01:20:10,123 --> 01:20:10,990
No more legal shit.

2004
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:13,873
How's Bubba?
(man laughing)

2005
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,840
You know, life man,

2006
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,692
just when you think you know,

2007
01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:19,470
it has like, this balance.

2008
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:20,510
No matter how much good you do,

2009
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,710
you do one, wrong thing, and bam.

2010
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:24,331
You gotta pay for it.

2011
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:25,164
I found that out the hard way.

2012
01:20:25,164 --> 01:20:26,768
That's that whole karma thing.

2013
01:20:26,768 --> 01:20:27,601
You can't mess with that.

2014
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:28,434
It comes right back to you.

2015
01:20:30,517 --> 01:20:31,400
I wish there was something I could do.

2016
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,307
Something, something,

2017
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:35,780
to make all this shit we went through worth it.

2018
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:39,684
(knocking at door)
Do you know why

2019
01:20:39,684 --> 01:20:41,602
he called this meeting?

2020
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,770
So, what's up man?

2021
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:47,400
Word came down. We have to keep an eye on Khaleel.

2022
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,730
Look, I don't have a problem with Khaleel.

2023
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:52,770
No, my brother, you do have a problem with Khaleel.

2024
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,470
If we have a problem with Khaleel,

2025
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:55,930
you're part of this organization,

2026
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,070
you have a problem with Khaleel.

2027
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,559
I mean Khaleel's lost his damn mind.

2028
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:02,600
He's going around burning down buildings now.

2029
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,898
He's outta control.
Khaleel

2030
01:21:03,898 --> 01:21:04,731
has to be under control.

2031
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:05,723
All right. Fine.

2032
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,120
I'm down for whatever.

2033
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,833
I'm in.

2034
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:10,970
So we'll make that work.

2035
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:13,528
You need to be at home by the phone right now.

2036
01:21:13,528 --> 01:21:14,873
It's your only way of getting in touch with her soon.

2037
01:21:14,873 --> 01:21:15,858
Yeah.

2038
01:21:15,858 --> 01:21:16,770
You're right. You're right.

2039
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,136
Listen, thank you for looking out.

2040
01:21:18,136 --> 01:21:19,398
If you need anything, let me know.

2041
01:21:19,398 --> 01:21:20,231
All right?

2042
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:21,481
Take care, bud.

2043
01:21:25,956 --> 01:21:28,240
(man sighing)

2044
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,995
(intense music)

2045
01:21:30,995 --> 01:21:33,583
(men struggling)

2046
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:35,450
You're gonna die. Come on!

2047
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,222
Huh, you steal those white boy?

2048
01:21:37,222 --> 01:21:38,628
It's time for you to die, boy.

2049
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:40,680
It's time for you to fucking die.

2050
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,373
My dream is to choke a cracker real slow.

2051
01:21:44,575 --> 01:21:46,500
It's time to slay a white devil.

2052
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,113
It's your time, and your time is up.

2053
01:21:50,443 --> 01:21:52,360
(man grunting)

2054
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:53,579
Yo, Khaleel!

2055
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:54,648
Let him go, man!

2056
01:21:54,648 --> 01:21:55,482
This shit aint right!
No, man.

2057
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:56,400
Fuck that, man!

2058
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,270
White men rule the world,

2059
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,605
use the media to condemn the black men and women.

2060
01:22:00,605 --> 01:22:02,660
I'm gonna make an example for his ass!

2061
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:03,910
This is our time.

2062
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:06,385
This is what it's all about!

2063
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:07,491
Come on!

2064
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:08,767
Get the fuck off me!

2065
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:10,130
Don't y'all get it?

2066
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,934
This is our time, man!

2067
01:22:11,934 --> 01:22:13,580
Don't y'all understand what I gotta do here?

2068
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,683
This is for us.

2069
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,420
For the new, black revolution, man!

2070
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,800
We gotta have a new vision that are doing it for us, man.

2071
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,598
You've gotta see what I'm trying to do for y'all!

2072
01:22:23,598 --> 01:22:25,090
What I wanna do for y'all!

2073
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,370
This is our time, man.

2074
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:28,490
Why you guys always working against me, man?

2075
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,101
That's fucked up.

2076
01:22:30,101 --> 01:22:33,468
Please. Don't raise against me.

2077
01:22:33,468 --> 01:22:34,410
That's not what we about, man.

2078
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:35,713
Please.
You fucked up.

2079
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,120
Yo, where's Rocco at?

2080
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,730
Oh, I haven't seen him.

2081
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:44,017
Actually. He should be here in a minute though.

2082
01:22:44,017 --> 01:22:45,600
Man.
You looking for Rocco too?

2083
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,573
Yeah. Yeah.

2084
01:22:47,543 --> 01:22:48,376
Me too.

2085
01:22:48,376 --> 01:22:49,209
Oh, what's your name?

2086
01:22:49,209 --> 01:22:50,340
Oliver Cross, Real Soul Records.

2087
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,690
Real Soul? Get out!

2088
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,730
Yo. Y'all got the bomb shit happening.

2089
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,690
Thanks.
Yo,

2090
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,090
I got a tape in the back.

2091
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:57,390
Yo, matter of fact.

2092
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,500
Fuck the tape, man. Yo, check this out.

2093
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,540
Boom. If it's rhymes you want,

2094
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:02,650
then it's rhymes I got.

2095
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,000
Make sure they platinum plus.

2096
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,420
Beat solid as a rock.

2097
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,830
Never sampling for number click for you to my own track.

2098
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:10,480
Some showing jealousy and try to hold my shit back.

2099
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,870
Never that black. Picture that,

2100
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,080
slacking in my game.

2101
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,130
My niggas wouldn't go for that.

2102
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:15,590
Nah, that would be insane.

2103
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,630
I'll be ashamed to grab a mic, and cook, and rip it.

2104
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,475
That's like you fronting me, for that, nah.

2105
01:23:19,475 --> 01:23:22,309
Man, you got a lot of talent my man.

2106
01:23:22,309 --> 01:23:24,425
Oh, thanks yo. Thanks.

2107
01:23:24,425 --> 01:23:25,425
I like that.
It's your lucky day.

2108
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:26,259
You know what?

2109
01:23:26,259 --> 01:23:28,020
I got this group, The Three Reasons.

2110
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,333
Yo, I heard of them.

2111
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:30,296
It'd be nice for you to come out.

2112
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:31,129
You know, just bring them out.

2113
01:23:31,129 --> 01:23:32,750
What do you think?

2114
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,720
Olly, I didn't know you're into rap.

2115
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,772
(man laughing)
Here's my card.

2116
01:23:36,772 --> 01:23:39,400
Give me a call about a 10:30, 11 o'clock tomorrow.

2117
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,377
No doubt, man. No doubt.

2118
01:23:41,377 --> 01:23:42,550
It was nice meeting you, man.

2119
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,300
For real.
(man clapping his chest)

2120
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,059
You know you got issues right?

2121
01:23:46,059 --> 01:23:47,350
Nah.
What's my name?

2122
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,430
Dang. Why is that? The cat's fat.

2123
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:52,210
Him, and Debbie Lewis on our team?

2124
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,323
We got it made.

2125
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:58,793
(restaurant chatter)

2126
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:01,400
(crowd cheering)

2127
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,809
I'm so pleased, that here at Rocco's,

2128
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:08,180
after an amazingly successful world tour,

2129
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:12,180
we have the queen of soul,

2130
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:15,120
