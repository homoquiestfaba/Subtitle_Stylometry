1220
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,971
- Because there was no gang.
- It was one man.

1221
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,340
Feathers knew all along.

1222
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:24,639
- Feathers? Who's Feathers?
- Hmm?

1223
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,808
The parrot at the newsstand?

1224
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:28,973
No...

1225
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:31,273
Can we just return
to Planet Earth for a moment?

1226
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:32,606
Phoenix Buchanan is

1227
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:35,338
a highly respected,
award-winning actor,

1228
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,173
and a member of
our Platinum club.

1229
00:59:37,175 --> 00:59:40,172
- He is not a petty thief.
- Hang on a minute, Henry.

1230
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:42,373
But let's just assume
I'm wrong, shall we?

1231
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,439
Okay.

1232
00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:44,740
And that the fortune-teller,

1233
00:59:44,742 --> 00:59:47,406
career criminal
and parrot are right.

1234
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:51,139
May I remind you that you
don't actually have any proof.

1235
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:54,709
Now, if anyone wants me,
I shall be putting up posters.

1236
00:59:56,974 --> 00:59:58,040
He's right.

1237
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:00,773
MRS. BIRD:
Well, I believe you, Mary.

1238
01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:05,373
Actors are some of
the most evil, devious people

1239
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,971
on the planet.

1240
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:10,238
- Are they?
- They lie for a living.

1241
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,472

1242
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,340
- If we're gonna catch one...
- Yes?

1243
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,542
...we're gonna need
a foolproof plan.

- Oh.

1246
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,308
KNUCKLES: Paddington.

1247
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:37,472
Knuckles?

1248
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,640
KNUCKLES: Got a proposition
for you, kid.

1249
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,039
Me and the boys have
been talking, and

1250
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,339
seems to us,

1251
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:45,373
if you're gonna clear
your name,

1252
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,738
you're gonna need our help.

1253
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,640
The Browns may mean well,
but...

1254
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:51,706
It takes a thief
to catch a thief.

1255
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,005
Oh.

1256
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:55,372
KNUCKLES: Now, if we could
figure a way out of here

1257
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:56,739
and hit the streets,

1258
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:58,672
we'd find this guy
soon enough.

1259
01:00:58,674 --> 01:01:01,672
But that would mean... escape.

1260
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:04,372
KNUCKLES: It certainly would.
And we got a plan.

1261
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:07,338
But it's a four-man job,
so we need your help.

1262
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,938
What do you say, kid?

1263
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,806
It's very kind of you,
Knuckles,

1264
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,605
but I don't think
Aunt Lucy would like

1265
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,506
the idea of us breaking out
of prison.

1266
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:17,772
The Browns will find
the real thief.

1267
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,938
I just need to be patient.

1268
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,639
You may not wanna hear this,
kid,

1269
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:26,741
but sooner or later
the Browns, well,

1270
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:29,271
they'll forget you.

1271
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,072
PHIBS: They always do.

1272
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:35,205
SPOON: They'll miss one visit.
Then two.

1273
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:37,972
KNUCKLES:
Before you know it,

1274
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:40,773
you won't have a home
to go back to.

1275
01:01:40,775 --> 01:01:44,240
You're wrong, Knuckles.
You're all wrong.

1276
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,939
The Browns aren't like that.

1277
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:49,139
They'll come tomorrow
and they'll have good news,

1278
01:01:49,141 --> 01:01:50,508
you'll see.

<i>Come in.</i>

1282
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:04,707
So what's this for, darlings?
School newspaper?

1283
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:06,774
Yes. We thought the agent
of the Phoenix Buchanan

1284
01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:08,073
would be really interesting.

1285
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:10,440
And you'd be right.
But I've got two minutes,

1286
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,072
so we better make it snappy.

1287
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:13,372
And I've only given you that

1288
01:02:13,374 --> 01:02:15,372
because you've brought
breakfast.

1289
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:17,609

1290
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,672
Here he comes.

- Hello, Joe. What a surprise.

1294

How's Paddington?

1295
01:02:28,308 --> 01:02:29,572
Oh, he's a tough wee bear.

1296
01:02:29,574 --> 01:02:31,640
Yeah, he is.
Well, send him my best.

1297
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:35,409
Yes, I will.
Thank you, Joe. Bye-bye.

1299
01:02:47,808 --> 01:02:51,006
So, when can we expect to see
Mr. Buchanan back on stage?

1300
01:02:51,008 --> 01:02:53,707
Phoenix? Oh, I wouldn't
hold your breath, darling.

1301
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:55,672
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no,
don't get me wrong.

1302
01:02:55,674 --> 01:02:57,805
He's a terrific actor,

1303
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,206
but there is a teensy
little problem.

1304
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,406
Really?

1305
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:03,440
He won't work
with other people.

1306
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:06,473
Thinks they dilute his talent.
