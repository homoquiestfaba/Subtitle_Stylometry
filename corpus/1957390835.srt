- Yeah, but you need a plan.

No, no, no. Listen.

<i>- Thanks for the plate number.</i>

494
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,280

I'm working a convicted felon,
kidnapped his ex-wife,

553
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,616
left two kids at the mother's house.

554
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,535
I need someone to send a unit over there.

555
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,330
<i>Okay, uh, how do you know
the kids are in there?</i>

556

561
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,929
…they don't live together

562
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,181
and both of their residences
are in our jurisdiction,

563
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,935
so I need you to send
a unit over to the mother's house.

564
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,062
[clears throat] And I need you
to send another unit…

<i>- Mm-hmm. I don't know, Joe.</i>
- We need to hurry.

569
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,286
Get a unit to the mother's house
and one to his.

570
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,288
Kick his fucking door in if you have to.

571

- Kick his fucking door in.

<i>Joe, excuse me?</i>

573

I talked to a terrified six-year-old girl,

574
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,384
and I promised her
that her mother would come home.

575

<i>I'm assuming that
there's no warrant for his residence.</i>

576

<i>So I'm gonna send someone
to the mother's house to check on the kid.</i>

577
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,562
No. I need you
to send a unit over to his house,

578
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,148

to send a unit over to her house.

<i>- Joe, it's too much...</i>
- No, God damn it, Bill!

<i>You are in enough trouble already.</i>

583
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,996
<i>I will send a car to the mother's house,</i>

584
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,041
<i>but I'm not gonna have
anyone kicking in any fucking doors.</i>

585
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,919
<i>It's not your job.</i>

586
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,548

976
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,970
I won't. All right.

977
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,057
<i>I just want to go home to my kids.</i>

978
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,643
<i>- They shouldn't be alone.</i>
- All right, now just listen.

979
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,938
<i>He put me in the back of the van
and I can't see anything.</i>

980
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,358
- No. Emily, listen to me.
<i>- I don't know why he's doing this.</i>

981
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,319
Listen to my voice, Emily.
All right? I'm with you.

982
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,529
<i>- He's gonna lock me up.</i>
- You're not alone.

983
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,240
All right? Do you understand?

984
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,785
<i>I don't want to die. </i>[sobbing]

985
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,744
Okay…

986
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,250
What does Henry do?
Why does Henry have a van?

987
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,128
<i>- I'm gonna die.</i>
- No, you're not. Emily. Emily...

988
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,714
<i>- I'm gonna die.</i>
- Emily, take a deep breath.

989
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:24,052
Now, I'm gonna get you back to Abby,
but I need your help. All right?

990
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:28,348
I need you to find something in the van
to defend yourself with.

991
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,434
- Is there anything back there?
<i>- I can't see anything.</i>

992
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,562
Just feel around you.
Use the flashlight on your phone.

993
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,982
[Emily panting]

994
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,735
<i>There's a cardboard box. A heavy box.</i>

995
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,281
<i>- Bricks.</i>
- Okay. Okay, good.

996
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,283
Good. Okay. Can you pick one up?

997
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,954
<i>I have one. I have one.</i>

998
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,956
Good. Okay, good. Okay.

999
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,542
Now, listen, Emily.

1000
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,879
When he stops the van
and he opens those doors,

1001
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,883
I want you to hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

1002
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,344
- [crying] <i>I can't do that.</i>
- You understand?

1003
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,804
- You can.
<i>- I can't do that.</i>

1004
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,307
- Emily?
<i>- Oh no.</i>

1005
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,850
- Emily, you can.
<i>- I can't.</i>

1006
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,978
Then you take his knife
and then you tell me where you are,

1007
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,354
and I will send help.

1008
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,355
<i>I can't.</i>

1009
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,358
Yes, you can, Emily. Emily.

1010
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,527
[Emily continues crying]

1011
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,073

- Emily. Emily, breathe. Emily, breathe.

1012
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,658
Come on. Come on now.

1013
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,369
- Come on. Come on.

- Emily.
- [continues crying] <i>I'm gonna die.</i>

1017
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,381
You're not. Emily, breathe with me.

[Emily exhales deeply]

1025
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,329
Emily, what's your favorite food?

1026
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:15,955
<i>Cherry…</i>

[chuckles lightly]

1029
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:24,089
Cherry Slurpees.
I don't know if that's a… a food.

1030
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,343
What… What do you like
to do with your kids? Huh?

1031
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,594
What's a nice thing…

1032
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,012
[breathes deeply]

1033
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,806
Keep breathing with me, all right?

1034
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,642
<i>- I like...</i>
- What do you like to do in your free time?

1035

<i>Henry…</i>

1037
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:48,571
What do you do with your kids, Emily?
What's a nice thing you do? Come on.

1038
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,657
[Emily crying]

1039
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:52,992
Come on.

1040
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,078
[Emily sighs deeply]

1041
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,581
<i>We like the aquarium.</i>

1042
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,292
Where?

1043
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,378
[both breathe deeply]

1044
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,297

<i>Have you been there?</i>

1046
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:14,431
No, I've always meant to,
uh, take my daughter there,

1047
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,933
but we never had a chance to.

1048
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,771
Tell me about…
Tell me about the aquarium. Is it nice?

1049
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:28,486
<i>Abby… Abby likes the turtles.</i>

1050
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,198
<i>She doesn't even look</i>

What do…
What do you like? You like the sharks?

1052
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,874
[sighs] <i>I like all of them.</i>

1053
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:47,297
<i>I usually walk behind Abby
with Oliver in the baby carriage,</i>

1054
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,384
<i>and then I just look</i>

1055
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,845
<i>and feel.</i>

1056
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,182
Feel what?

00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,684
[Emily breathes deeply]

1058
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,812
<i>Seems so peaceful.</i>

1059
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,650
What does?

1060
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,989
<i>Under the water. Like…</i>

1061
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,534
<i>Like quiet.</i>

1062
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,037
<i>Like being held.</i>

1063
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:26,961
<i>No distractions.
Just water flowing around you.</i>

1064
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,839
<i>Very quiet,</i>

1065
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:31,966
<i>like a big,</i>

1066
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,637
<i>blue silence.</i>

1067
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,307
Yeah.

<i>I like you, Joe.</i>

1072
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,371
I like you too, Emily.

<i>Would you like to come with us?</i>

1074

- Take it easy, Emily. Just…
<i>- I'm scared!</i>

1080

- Put your phone in your pocket.
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

1081
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,318
And when he opens those doors,

1082
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,446
you take that brick and you hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

1083

- He deserves it.
<i>- Oh God.</i>
