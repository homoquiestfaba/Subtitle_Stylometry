1
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,800
One day, in the spring of 1938,...

2
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,001
the letter arrived.

3
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:39,503
It was formal in tone, written in a fine italic hand.

4
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,306
"My dear Ellen Kendall,

5
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:34,808
"Hearing from me after nine years must indeed seem strange...

6
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:40,509
"but I can assure you, sufficient reason prompted this long silence.

7
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,510
"Having just heard of my wife's passing, I at once reasoned...

8
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:48,011
"the honorable thing could only be to again assume my paternal duties,...

9
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:51,613
"forsaken, lo, these many years."

10
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:56,814
"Rest assured that we here at the Landing...

11
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,315
"have a beautiful home, healthful food...

12
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:06,016
"and a cultured atmosphere with which to provide my son."

13
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:11,518
Cultured atmosphere, hell. The only thing Ed Sansom cares about...

14
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:15,619
is boxing and trophies. He wouldn't know culture if it slugged him in the mouth.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,606
That bastard's got a nerve, leaving his wife and kid.

16
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,607
And then dropping out of the damned sky after nine years!

17
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:28,309
Well, maybe we shouldn't send him after all.

18
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,110
I've got enough mouths to feed! I say send him.

19
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,411
He needs time. He just lost his mother.

20
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,612
He's barely gotten settled in here with us.

21
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,613
That mama's boy! He gives me the creeps.

22
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:47,615
Just wandering around here with that long face like he's looking for a tit to suck!

23
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,916
You couldn't blame Aunt Ellen and Uncle Jack for letting me go.

24
00:02:55,517 --> 00:03:00,708
I was a silent and difficult child, who made grownups feel uncomfortable.

25
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:05,410
And this summons from my father did not come as a complete surprise...

26
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:11,111
for I'd always counted on somesuch happening all along.

27
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:15,812
We just don't have room for all that, Joel.

28
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:21,614
Well, why don't you pick out just a few things...

29
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:25,315
and I'll bring the rest when I come for a visit, all right?

30
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,817
Roger was my only friend in New Orleans.

31
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:44,418
We lived in a world of make-believe and tall tales.

32
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:12,620
My father had been a boxing promoter, traveling all over the country to fights.

33
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:16,522
I used to tell people he did secret work for the government...

34
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,323
and was being held hostage by the enemy.

35
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,124
My mother had to work after my father was captured...

36
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:23,825
but then she got sick and died...

37
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:26,026
so I had to go live with my aunt and uncle...

38
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,713
until I got this letter from my father.

39
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:33,314
How long's it been since you saw your daddy?

40
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,616
How many years had we waited, mother and me?

41
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:48,317
How many days? In truth, I had lost all sense of time.

42
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,321
I'd like a beer.

43
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,322
Well, I like your spirit, Baby Love.

44
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:45,123
Could you please tell me when the next bus leaves for Skully's Landing?

45
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:47,225
Ain't no bus to the Skulls.

46
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:51,626
My father has a house out there. I'm going to live with him.

47
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:53,827
Your father? What's his name?

48
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,528
Edward R. Sansom.

49
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,429
Sansom...never heard of him.

50
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,831
The only people I've heard of out at the Skulls is Randolph Skully and his old-maid cousin.

51
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,532
Believe her name's Amy.

52
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,033
When Randolph's Pa died off, he left the place for a few years.

53
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,234
Since he come back, they's stayed in real close.

54
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,235
Don't nobody never see them.

55
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,236
Listen, my father DOES live at the Landing. See, here's the letter.

56
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:28,137
Ain't that pretty!

57
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,239
I saw Jesus Fever out back. He's the Skullys' boy.

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
He's been sleeping all day in the wagon.

59
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,042
Oh, now don't go off in a huff.

60
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:51,943
Excuse me, sir.

61
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:54,644
I'm looking for Jesus Fever.

62
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:57,835
You're looking at him.

63
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,121
Could you please take me to the Landing?

64
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:02,923
Get up there in the wagon, boy.

65
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:10,824
Mr. Fever --- Edward Sansom does live at the Landing, doesn't he?

66
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,025
They say he do. But I ain't never seen him.

67
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,727
Get out of there, Idabell. You go on home now!

68
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:56,630
~ "Swing low, sweet chariot..."
~ "Coming for to carry me home..."

69
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:04,031
Hey, I'm Florabell Thompkins. Glad to meet you.

70
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:11,532
Oh, good gracious, look at Jesus Fever. He's plum asleep.

71
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,134
Come on, Idabell, there's oodles of room.

72
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,535
Huh, no use trying to reason with her,...

73
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:20,636
she's got willful ways. Ask anybody!

74
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:23,537
I slammed the car door on Idabell's hand...

75
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:26,538
and she didn't even cry! Now her thumb nail won't grow...

76
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,139
and it's all lumpy and black.

77
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,041
~ Hey, Idabell, show him your hand!
~ Shut up or I'll show it to you in a place you'll like.

78
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:40,842
You're nothing but a low-down pissant. I'm going to tell Daddy on you.

79
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,643
Oh, good gracious. Well, it was nice meeting you.

80
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:48,344
Come see us sometime. We live right down the side road a way.

81
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:48,749
I'm Amy Skully. You may call me Miss Amy.

82
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,151
Please --- where's my father?

83
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:21,653
Your father is not well. Nor is Cousin Randolph.

84
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:27,754
Randolph will be most unhappy that he missed your arrival.

85
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:30,955
but I thought it best that he stay in bed.

86
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:42,957
I've always considered this the finest room in the house...on account of the view.

87
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,358
Cousin Randolph was born in this bed...

88
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,559
and his mother Angelee died here, oh not so many years ago.

89
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,360
We've never used it since.

90
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,762
We haven't any modern plumbing facilities...

91
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:06,663
Cousin Randolph is very opposed to contrivances of that sort.

92
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:19,515
My father didn't say anything about you and...and Randolph in his letter.

93
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,316
Oh. Randolph is a friend of your father's.

94
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,118
Well, Papa's in my father's house.

95
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:22,439
I had known and explored other houses quiet with emptiness, but here there were voices in the walls.

96
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,540
Sounds on the edge of silence.

97
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:57,943
Father?

98
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,744
Father?

99
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:15,346
Hey --- you Joel?

100
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,247
I'm Missouri Fever.

101
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,148
Everybody calls me Zoo.

102
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,949
Miss Amy said to find you and feed you.

103
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,551
I wanted to see my father.

104
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:30,152
You can't see your Daddy today. Now come on, I'll make you some nice hotcakes and grits.

105
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,453
I need to see him.

106
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:38,654
Ain't you a fright, though --- poking out that little skinny chest, you just might scare me to death.

107
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:40,043
Now come on.

108
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:42,945
I ain't going to hurt you.

109
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:54,346
Now, you might as well make up your mind to eat. Mr. Randolph will take you to see your Daddy when he gets good and ready to.

110
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,648
I'm going to make you about ten pancakes.

111
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,649
You need fattening up.

112
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,150
She killed that bird with a poker. I saw her myself.

113
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,451
Oh, don't fret about that.

114
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:18,353
You see, Mr. Randolph, he's a fine artiste.

115
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,954
He makes beautiful things with bird feathers.

116
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,355
See? He made me this snuff box.

117
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:28,356
It's covered with blue jays and robins and no telling what.

118
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:31,057
~ Ain't it pretty, though?
~ It is pretty.

119
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:33,758
He paints pictures, too.

120
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,960
Whoo-ee --- he paints mighty fine pictures!

121
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,461
He says he's going to paint me one of these days,...

122
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:41,561
but I told him no because I got this ugly scar.

123
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,962
My husband Kenk, he cut my throat.

124
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:46,763
Now he's on a chain gang.

125
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:50,264
My luck holds out, he'll die there.

126
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:52,665
He cut your throat?!

127
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:59,167
Papa-daddy, he say Kenk's the meanest son of a bitch ever walk on two feet.

128
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:03,648
Is Jesus Fever your father? He's so old.

129
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,249
No, he my Granddaddy. Papa-daddy, he say Kenk ruined my life.

130
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,550
Say I ought to leave this place, these folks is crazy.

131
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,152
But I'm staying, as long as Papa-daddy need me.

132
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:20,153
When somebody needs you, it makes your body important to him --- makes you worth something.

133
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,954
But I made up my mind --- as soon as Papa-daddy die,...

134
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:30,255
I'm leaving this swamp-land. Going to get me a big job in a fine hotel...

135
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:31,557
where it snow.

136
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,058
~ You ever see snow?
~ Yeah, once.

137
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:39,559
You did? Damn! Tell me about the snow!

138
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,260
What'd it look like? What'd it feel like?

139
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:45,361
Well, snow is very very cold,...

140
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:46,762
and it's very white.

141
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:52,764
Praise the Lord. Whee, I can't wait! Is it shiny?

142
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:56,965
Shiny white? I mean, do it sparkle like real diamonds?

143
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:03,966
Well, it's just white...and cottony. And, yeah, it sparkles.

144
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:08,468
It snow a lot of places. I'll go a lot of places to see it.

145
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:15,969
I'll go to...to Washington. And maybe I'll go to Boston, Connecticut.

146
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,070
~ I'm taking off my shoes, and I'll run, and run...
~ Zoo!

147
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,471
Those pancakes are burning.

148
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,173
Can't you do anything right?

149
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,964
I'm sorry. Usually she cooks quite well.

150
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:39,565
And would you please take Mr. Randolph up his breakfast. He's still in bed.

151
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,066
Miss Amy?

152
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:46,768
About my father --- I'd like to see him now.

153
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:52,469
Well, as you know, your father is not well.

154
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,870
I do not think it advisable for you to see him just yet.

155
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:25,076
Zoo --- is he really ill --- my father?

156
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,278
Now listen here: we friends, that's fine.

157
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:39,779
Only don't never ask me nothing about Mr. Sansom.

158
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,180
Miss Amy the one that take care of him. I only fix his vittles.

159
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,981
Now me and Papa-daddy got a church service in about an hour.

160
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:53,683
You go get cleaned up and you can come sing with us.

161
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:22,985
Zoo. Can you take in all the clothes. I believe it's going to rain.

162
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,586
And go shut all the windows.

163
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:58,889
¤ I don't want to ride on the Devil's side, I just want to ride with you.

164
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,691
¤ I don't want to ride on the Devil's side, I just want to ride with you.

165
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:12,892
¤ If you got a thirst and your water done gone, praise the Lord, bring it on and on.

166
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:19,693
¤ If you got a hunger and your food done gone, praise the Lord, bring it on and on.

167
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:25,295
¤ Praise the Lord, praise the Lord...

168
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:35,296
¤ I don't want to ride on the Devil's side, I just want to ride with you. ¤

169
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,297
Well, now, Sunshine, we thinking to pray.

170
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,899
Well, if you're going to do it, do it!

171
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,700
We praying silently. Everyone prays their own. Now put down that liquor and pray.

172
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:09,002
~ Amen.
~ Amen.

173
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,403
You got it?

174
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:20,105
You see this, Joel? This going to get me to the snow.

175
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:24,806
Lil' Sunshine's charms work every single time.

176
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:30,007
Oh, this here charm guarantees no terrible happenings is going to happen.

177
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:34,308
Why don't you make one for the boy? He going to need it!

178
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:38,410
The spirits don't work unless you ask yourself.

179
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,511
Mr. Sunshine, would you please make me a charm?

180
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:46,912
Speaking of spirits...

181
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:51,013
I got to take Mr. Randolph his medicine.

182
00:21:51,714 --> 00:21:55,115
Damn old medicine for the Devil Hisself.

183
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:03,816
He live in the old Cloud Hotel, and it about to fall in on him.

184
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:08,617
He got to cross over a swamp full on snakes to get there.

185
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:14,619
Zoo --- are there any other women besides Miss Amy living in the big house?

186
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,220
No they ain't, thank goodness. She enough!

187
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:55,574
Lovely, isn't it?

188
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,075
I found it in a little out-of-the-way-shop in Vienna.

189
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:03,076
You can have it, if you like.

190
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:06,777
Are you Mr. Skully, sir?

191
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,979
I am. Indeed.

192
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,680
But you shall call me Randolph.

193
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,881
I had so much wanted to welcome you myself to the Landing.

194
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,482
But, alas, my health has always let me down.

195
00:23:23,183 --> 00:23:25,183
This cigarette is for asthmatics.

196
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,185
Some find the aroma offensive.

197
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,586
Now, Joel, come closer.

198
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:35,987
Come!

199
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:38,388
Show me your hands.

200
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,079
My, my. Fascinating!

201
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,181
Simply fascinating!

202
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:46,982
I'd like to see my father.

203
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:51,483
Yes, of course, and you will...when you're quite settled.

204
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,084
The lifeline drawn is certainly long enough.

205
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,285
There's the heart line.

206
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:01,486
You may find love when you least expect it.

207
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:04,488
Yes! You have exciting possibilities.

208
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:06,489
Talents as yet undiscovered.

209
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,690
How do I discover my talents?

210
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:15,891
I will paint your portrait.

211
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:21,493
And while I paint you, we'll talk. You have a fine complexion.

212
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,694
Touches of vermillion...

213
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:30,795
Do you not recognize your father?

214
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:39,897
Always a smart dresser, Ed, with his bow tie and striped waistcoats.

215
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,399
The girl is Dolores. I once loved her very much.

216
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,600
And that is Pepe Álvarez, a prize fighter managed by your father.

217
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:08,101
An utterly bewildering creature.

218
00:25:09,502 --> 00:25:12,502
Brutal, yet strangely like a child.

219
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:17,204
With Dolores I felt very much alive.

220
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:20,705
A variegated butterfly, spreading his wings at last.

221
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:29,406
We traveled the world, and then in Havana where we alighted in one stifling summer.

222
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:35,908
~ We came across Pepe.
~ Havana, Cuba? That's the last place my mother heard from my Dad.

223
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,109
And of course, your father.

224
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,110
But we're getting ahead of our story.

225
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:49,711
A flower is blooming inside you. And soon, when all the tight petals unfold,...

226
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:53,013
when the noon of youth burns whitest,...

227
00:25:54,814 --> 00:26:00,114
You will turn, much as others have, for the opening of another door.

228
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:16,316
"Dear Roger,
"You would like my father.

229
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:20,985
"He knows all about airplanes, and he has a boat and a fine Chevrolet."

230
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,587
This is cold. Take it back and heat it up, please.

231
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:40,188
Randolph? Zoo told me what her husband did to her.

232
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:46,489
Oh, yes, Kenk. He always was a little unbalanced.

233
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,091
I, of course, objected to their marriage.

234
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,192
Did my father know he cut her throat?

235
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:58,993
Now let's see --- it happened late one night...

236
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:03,494
~ in...um...November, I think.
~ November 16th, Dear.

237
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:09,596
He was sitting in the parlor and I said, "It's the wind".

238
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:10,897
Of course, I knew it wasn't.

239
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:16,498
But I put a roller on the piano, and it played "Indian Love Call".

240
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,799
Such a sad song, don't you think so, Sweet?

241
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,001
But didn't you try to help her?

242
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:29,702
Oh, no. One must never interfere. These people are very dangerous.

243
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:32,103
How does that song go, Randolph?

244
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:37,904
"I've been calling you...

245
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:42,606
~ Is that it, Randolph?
~ But he cut her throat!

246
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,907
These people are always cutting each other.

247
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:07,609
Let's go into the parlor.

248
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,510
Shall we?

249
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:22,812
Amy my dear, must you play that?

250
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:28,013
It's a dreadful old song. I detest it.

251
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:34,514
I can't seem to do anything right, can I?

252
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:42,216
I need music. I need to dance.

253
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:45,817
You don't care, do you?

254
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,118
That's not true, my dear.

255
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:54,920
You never thanked me for those nice blue jay feathers that I got for you.

256
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,721
They're lovely.

257
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:23,923
Do you remember when this used to be the center of the world...

258
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:29,424
and people from Alabama, and Tennessee, and New Orleans --- they all used to come here?

259
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:32,326
Randolph, how do we get those days back again?

260
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,627
Amy my dear, you know better.

261
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:38,728
They're the leman, we are outside of time.

262
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:39,929
All we're doing is serving the prayer meetings.

263
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,830
Why did you leave me here all alone all those years?

264
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,632
Everything's going to be all right.

265
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:56,233
Everything's going to be all right.

266
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:18,535
What we want most is life is only be held and told...

267
00:30:18,936 --> 00:30:21,398
that everything's going to be all right.

268
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,099
Everything's a funny thing.

269
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,201
His papa's eyes...the boy that makes you cry after school.

270
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:34,602
His mama's long hair...and being afraid.

271
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:39,903
And twisted faces in the bedroom wall.

272
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,905
Randolph...I seen a lady in the window this morning.

273
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:49,706
I had a hunch you'd be able to see her...I see her often.

274
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,207
She may be our dear great grandmother...

275
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:57,508
who died an untimely, tragic death.

276
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:00,209
The ghost's mode of dress is certainly of that period.

277
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,711
~ Ghost?
~ She's quite harmless.

278
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:11,312
I've never told anyone, so I hope you'll keep it a secret.

279
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,813
As a courtesy to her.

280
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,915
I think it's time for bed.

281
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:29,516
"Dear Aunt Ellen,
"I still have not seen my father.

282
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:33,517
"Amy says he's sick, but maybe he doesn't want me here after all.

283
00:31:33,618 --> 00:31:34,718
"Please write."

284
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,121
Pepe Álvarez, Spain...Pepe Álvarez, Denmark...Japan, India...

285
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,024
Florabell, I got it.

286
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:39,625
Fiddle-dee-dee. Here she comes.

287
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,526
She would steal us a watermelon.

288
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:47,527
I don't approve of stealing myself, but Idabell...she'd do anything so's it's dangerous.

289
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:48,928
Hi, Idabell.

290
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,830
You'll have to excuse her manners, Joel.

291
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:03,431
Get away from here, Henry --- you stink.

292
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:05,432
You kick Henry and I'll bust your mouth.

293
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,133
Daddy says he's going to do away with Henry any day now.

294
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:09,834
I can't wait.

295
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:14,536
And he says that if you don't mind your ways, he'll send you to live with Aunt Doris. So there!

296
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:18,537
Florabell, Idabell --- I need to talk to you. They won't let me see my dad.

297
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:20,038
You're just lying, you whore.

298
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:24,539
Wait! Get away! Help me! Let me go!

299
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,840
Go on home and cut out paper dolls, sissy britches.

300
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,442
No, sis, stop this!

301
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:48,144
It was as if I saw the Landings and its bizarre inhabitants...

302
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:52,445
through a prism, for nothing was the way it seemed.

303
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:57,226
Randolph and Amy were actors in a play, with neither plot nor motive...

304
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:59,527
and I was their sole audience.

305
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:14,128
It's your move, Randolph.

306
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,731
Joel?

307
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:47,432
Where are you, Joel?

308
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:50,733
Joel!

309
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,135
Father?

310
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,036
Are you here?

311
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:22,138
It's me --- Joel!

312
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:28,539
Joel --- I wanted to explain about...

313
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,840
What's wrong with him, Randolph?

314
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:33,641
An accident.

315
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:37,843
A tragic accident.

316
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:44,644
It happened not too long after he deserted you and your mother.

317
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:47,045
But we never knew.

318
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,545
He was so ashamed.

319
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:57,047
Leaving you the way he did.

320
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:03,017
But that letter --- my father couldn't have written it!

321
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:06,018
You wrote it! Why did you want me to come here?

322
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:10,119
~ Why? Why?!
~ Stop it. Stop this arguing.

323
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,821
Oh, for God's sake! Can't you see you're upsetting your father?

324
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:23,022
When I read that your mother'd died, I felt great sorrow for you.

325
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:25,423
So alone, so young.

326
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:26,924
No one to guide you.

327
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:30,425
No one to introduce you to the wonders of life.

328
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:34,327
Your Aunt Ellen wouldn't have allowed you to come here if she knew the truth.

329
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,328
You know that.

330
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,129
But why did he leave us?

331
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,130
All right, that's enough. Come on, calm yourself.

332
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:52,332
Come on, let's go lie down, Darling. Let's go lie down.

333
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:53,533
Come on.

334
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:22,935
"Dear Aunt Ellen,
"I'm writing to tell you I can't live here...

335
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,936
"and that you must come and get me right away."

336
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:32,238
When I looked at my father, I could feel nothing for him.

337
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:36,239
I just thought of all the things we would have done together,...

338
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,740
all the places he would have taken me.

339
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,641
Boo!

340
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:47,483
You want to go fishing with me?

341
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:51,484
I thought you didn't like me.

342
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:57,085
What made you think that?

343
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:01,286
Do you believe in ghosts?

344
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:06,188
Well, sure --- everybody knows there's ghosts. Lil' Sunshine sees'em all the time.

345
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:10,989
C'mon, Joel.

346
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:27,591
Yeah, my old man's as mean as snot, and Mom thinks Florabell is some precious puss.

347
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:30,592
Doesn't make her go live with that tacky Aunt Doris.

348
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:34,493
Well, at least your father didn't just up and leave his family.

349
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:38,895
Think, my Daddy, he got this job in Washington. He'd be the President's...

350
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:44,096
main advisor. He was real rich and had a mansion close to the White House...

351
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:47,397
but all that went right to his head.

352
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:49,398
He thought he was too good for us.

353
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:53,499
So he left mother and took up with this high-falutin' society lady.

354
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,801
Then this woman decided to take him for all he was worth.

355
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,502
And so she did.

356
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:00,803
She stole his money?

357
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:05,504
Idabell, whiskey-women have their way of getting men to give them their money.

358
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,405
How? What kind of ways? Tell me!

359
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:12,006
Well, I don't think it'd work for you.

360
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:21,611
He just keeps staring --- like he sees right through me.

361
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:27,512
Well, I ain't hardly seen him since he were brought here by Mr. Randolph.

362
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:36,914
He say: "Missouri, this gentleman is mighty sick. And you do not have the knowledge to administer to his needs.

363
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:39,615
"Miss Amy will be taking care of him."

364
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:43,816
Hold still, boy. It's only the postman.

365
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:47,818
Come on, you got to be all fresh and clean so Mr. Randolph can paint you now.

366
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,324
Soon we'll begin your lessons. I've other school books.

367
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:16,329
You mean I won't be going to school?

368
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:21,336
In her letter, your aunt told me this term you missed 22 days.

369
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,642
I assume you dislike school as much as I do.

370
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,346
Well...it's OK.

371
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:32,252
Careful now, don't twitch --- I'm doing your mouth.

372
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:43,866
Teachers are so inept.

373
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,084
"Dear Roger,
"Out here a person as young as us is a grown-up person.

374
00:41:59,286 --> 00:42:02,896
"We drink alcoholic beverages and play cards all night.

375
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,403
"There are no electric lights, radios, or picture shows.

376
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:13,810
"And if you want to take a bath, you've got to fill a washtub with water from the well.

377
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,213
"Remember to write your friend Joel."

378
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:31,732
"After a while, though, she took up her residence at Rome under the protection of Pope Pius VII...

379
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:35,738
"who treated her with great kindness and respect.

380
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:43,248
"In 1818, she addressed a pathetic letter to the powers assembled at the Congress of Aix..."

381
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,352
Aix. It's a city.

382
00:42:47,354 --> 00:42:53,861
"petitioning for Napoleon's release on the grounds that he was suffering from a mortal illness."

383
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:55,865
Oh, yes, I remember.

384
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,964
Where is it...oh...aha!

385
00:43:04,468 --> 00:43:08,773
My darling son, Napoleon, l'Empereur...

386
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:45,215
When you left, mother worked hard.

387
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:50,923
She cried. For years she cried.

388
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:54,128
Then she got sick.

389
00:43:57,232 --> 00:44:01,136
I tried to cheer her up, telling her sort of adventure stories...

390
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:04,340
the ones you used to tell me...

391
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:08,247
but I couldn't never tell them like you could.

392
00:44:49,996 --> 00:44:52,089
I saw you out running again last night.

393
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:53,892
Why do you do that?

394
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:58,898
I'm practicing. When I leave this place, I'm going to leave fast.

395
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:01,602
Papa-daddy cough all night.

396
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:03,907
You think he's going to die?

397
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:12,717
When I get to the snow, I'm going to get myself a big job...

398
00:45:12,818 --> 00:45:16,122
and when you ready to leave this crazy place, you can come live with me.

399
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:19,427
I'm sure my Aunt Ellen's coming to get me.

400
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:23,333
You think that a fact, huh?

401
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:37,049
"The salvation of his leadership by Sheridan's victories and by Sherman's capture of Atlanta..."

402
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,854
Ah! The Civil War!

403
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:45,561
I wish I had some sports books or something. He looks so bored with this Civil War stuff.

404
00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:48,765
Perhaps Lincoln's assassination will perk him up.

405
00:45:55,173 --> 00:45:57,777
Someone tried to assassinate me, once.

406
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:02,369
If by assassination one means the destruction of another's dreams...

407
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,374
and the plundering of another's soul.

408
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,282
I wonder what became of the assassin?

409
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:18,291
And I wonder what became of me.

410
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:25,699
Yes. I wonder what became of me.

411
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:38,715
Randolph spoke a language only he seemed able to understand.

412
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:42,921
He said his life was just a joke which he played on himself.

413
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:49,930
Today, you said you'd tell me about my father, remember?

414
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:56,439
I remember. I know...

415
00:46:57,141 --> 00:47:00,444
~ we'll have a picnic.
~ A picnic? Where? In the garden?

416
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:02,247
Oh, dear me, no.

417
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,253
Nature's exuberance is so overpowering.

418
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:15,465
In Havana, we rented a lovely pink villa by the sea.

419
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,469
Dolores liked to sit naked in the sun.

420
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:20,572
She was like a child.

421
00:47:21,574 --> 00:47:23,076
Nothing held her interest for long.

422
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:29,385
And thus, on a summer's evening, the air scented with jasmine,...

423
00:47:30,187 --> 00:47:32,272
Pepe came into my life.

424
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:36,978
They were drinking and laughing together...

425
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:40,583
in a sidewalk café.

426
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:48,994
There was an intimacy in their attitude which made me still inside.

427
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:51,298
As I stood and watched them,...

428
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,101
unseen.

429
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:57,006
Dolores looked into Pepe's panther eyes...

430
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,708
and was lost to me.

431
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:00,912
And I to her.

432
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:04,217
Was my father there?

433
00:48:07,322 --> 00:48:08,623
I believe he was.

434
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,734
Later, Dolores asked whether I'd care to meet her new friends.

435
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:21,740
The prize fighter and his manager.

436
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:28,749
It seems strange...

437
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,652
now we were always together.

438
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:37,361
Ed telling silly jokes, Pepe and Dolores gazing at each other.

439
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:44,270
It was quite obvious they were in love.

440
00:48:50,278 --> 00:48:53,281
As I looked from one to the other,...

441
00:48:54,684 --> 00:49:04,377
I began to realize with some alarm that it was not of her I was jealous...but of him.

442
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:13,388
We're alone, dear child --- isolated each from the other.

443
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,093
So fierce is the world's ridicule.

444
00:49:18,096 --> 00:49:21,099
We cannot speak, nor show our tenderness.

445
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:33,814
The brain may take advice...

446
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:40,323
but the heart? Love having no geography...

447
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,728
knows no bounds.

448
00:49:45,331 --> 00:49:48,033
Weight it down, sink it deep --- no matter!

449
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:50,337
It will find the surface.

450
00:49:56,546 --> 00:49:59,149
Any love is natural and beautiful...

451
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,951
but lies within a person's nature.

452
00:50:02,643 --> 00:50:06,358
Only a hypocrite would hold a man responsible for what he loves.

453
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:12,517
I hope you agree with me, dear boy.

454
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:14,520
Agree with what?

455
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:22,230
Never mind. All difficult music must be heard more than once.

456
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:29,238
Randolph was right. We were all outside of time, encircling the present.

457
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,046
Zoo dreaming of snow, my father's eyes traveling the world.

458
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,155
Ready? Now it's the Mardi Gras.

459
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:48,765
Ed was a Franciscan monk, and Pepe went very appropriately as a bandit.

460
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:53,571
Dolores devised my costume.

461
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:58,677
Françoise, I'm a lovely countess at the court of Versailles.

462
00:51:01,181 --> 00:51:03,984
I have silver hair and satin slippers...

463
00:51:04,386 --> 00:51:09,392
a mask, and I'm wrapped in silk, dispassuante pink.

464
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:18,603
I advanced before the mirror, I saw her face me.

465
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:26,514
then, pleases to rapture, for I am very beautiful.

466
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,424
I appear at the top of the barroom steps...

467
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,427
Pepe doesn't recognize me...

468
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,031
and begs me to dance.

469
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:46,841
It's the most wonderful evening of my life.

470
00:51:49,545 --> 00:51:52,247
Toad into prince, tin into gold...

471
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,853
fly, feathered serpents...

472
00:51:56,955 --> 00:51:57,756
the hour grows old.

473
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:06,485
And yet, would you believe this?

474
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:09,690
A few months later he was gone...

475
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:11,593
and Dolores with him.

476
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:15,798
They ransacked my room and took my money.

477
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,502
What little remained.

478
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,708
Did he ever know?

479
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:24,912
Know what, my dear?

480
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:26,615
That it was you.

481
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,021
It wasn't really me.

482
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:40,533
There are ghosts, flitting momentarily before tired eyes.

483
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:49,544
Ed was furious.

484
00:52:50,746 --> 00:52:54,751
Called me dreadful, hurtful names.

485
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:59,558
He blamed me, but of course it was he who'd turned Pepe against me.

486
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:05,265
Caused him to run off...without so much as a goodbye.

487
00:53:10,672 --> 00:53:14,777
We had rolled the dice, and we had both lost.

488
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:19,584
Our futures were rushing away to some distant sunset.

489
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,590
And so, here we remain.

490
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:28,395
Two empty husks, remembering what?

491
00:53:28,797 --> 00:53:33,102
Other people's voices, echoing in forgotten rooms.

492
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,712
What happened then?

493
00:53:41,313 --> 00:53:49,222
Then...then...Ed rushed out into the street...

494
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:51,125
like a man in a daze.

495
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,331
I heard a horrible screech of tires.

496
00:53:55,833 --> 00:54:00,738
The driver swerved, but it was too late.

497
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,722
When it was clear that the doctors could do nothing for him,...

498
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:11,829
I brought him here. Amy finally agreed to look after him.

499
00:54:18,337 --> 00:54:25,045
And I suppose we shall all go on together --- until the house sinks,...

500
00:54:26,147 --> 00:54:32,752
until the garden grows up and weeds hide us in their depth.

501
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:13,800
And we have the reigning champion, Pepe Álvarez!

502
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:16,704
He comes with a left, a left, and a right!

503
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:33,424
But didn't Dad even talk about us?

504
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:37,730
~ Momma and me?
~ Why, yes, he did.

505
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:41,236
I believe he was sorry for what he'd done.

506
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:50,747
But...try to understand --- he was like a man possessed.

507
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:57,555
You know...I've written to my friend, Roger, and Aunt Ellen.

508
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,762
I guess they've forgotten me, too.

509
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:05,157
No one could ever forget you, dear Joel.

510
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,662
They...they're simply busy.

511
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:11,867
Distracted by things and people they see.

512
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:26,885
Read these poems.

513
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,691
And your imagination will soar above the mindlessness of common humanity.

514
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,803
Randolph kept an atlas in his room.

515
00:56:41,005 --> 00:56:44,709
And every week he would select places at random from around the world...

516
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,114
and write to Pepe Álvarez, just care of the postmaster.

517
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:03,832
And as the weeks went by, I waited for Aunt Ellen to come and get me.

518
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:37,372
Hey, Lord. Hey, Lord...

519
00:57:38,874 --> 00:57:41,077
Hey, Zoo. What are you digging?

520
00:57:41,678 --> 00:57:44,882
Papa-daddy told me the time's drawing nigh --- I better start digging.

521
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:47,886
Takes girls a long time to dig a grave.

522
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:48,989
Probably a whole week.

523
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:53,595
He say if I wait 'til he croaked, he'll stink up the whole place while I get it dug.

524
00:57:54,598 --> 00:57:56,399
I'm...I'm sorry he's dying.

525
00:57:58,002 --> 00:57:58,903
Me, too.

526
00:58:00,906 --> 00:58:03,993
Zoo? Do you think dead people are as lonely as we are?

527
00:58:04,995 --> 00:58:07,599
Hey --- what kind of talk is that?

528
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,806
I love you, Zoo. And you've got to love me.

529
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,110
I do love you, Baby.

530
00:58:17,012 --> 00:58:18,213
I'll help you dig.

531
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:28,927
"If flowers fall today, tomorrow dies.

532
00:58:30,029 --> 00:58:33,733
"All that we wish to stay, tempts and then flies.

533
00:58:33,734 --> 00:58:37,939
"What is the world's delight, lightening that mocks the night."

534
00:58:44,848 --> 00:58:48,953
Each feather has, according to Sizengunnar, a particular position,...

535
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:51,957
and if one were the slightest awry,...

536
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:53,860
it would not look at all real.

537
00:58:54,862 --> 00:58:56,864
But what good is a bird that can't fly?

538
00:58:58,367 --> 00:58:59,268
I beg your pardon?

539
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,973
The other one was real. It could fly.

540
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:03,776
But Amy killed it.

541
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:05,779
Flight is in the mind.

542
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:12,687
There are countless millions of blue jays, but there will never be another creation exactly like this.

543
00:59:20,298 --> 00:59:21,599
I have a game.

544
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:24,974
I bought it for Amy many years ago.

545
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:26,076
She always liked games.

546
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,582
Do you like games, Joel?

547
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,097
~ How many do you have?
~ Eleven.

548
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:45,101
Randolph?

549
00:59:45,302 --> 00:59:46,103
What is it?

550
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:51,309
Well...what is it?

551
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:59,120
Oh. That's the game that you and I used to play together all the time.

552
01:00:01,123 --> 01:00:03,225
We used to do so much together.

553
01:00:05,128 --> 01:00:07,831
We will allow you to play with us if you wish.

554
01:00:10,635 --> 01:00:13,140
I'm the one that's always shown you love.

555
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,045
And affection.

556
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,649
I'm the one that's always been good to you.

557
01:00:20,152 --> 01:00:24,857
Now, my dear --- you mustn't carry on so.

558
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:27,561
Calm yourself.

559
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,065
Before you become ill.

560
01:00:37,274 --> 01:00:39,377
It's just --- I'm so lonely, Randolph.

561
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,482
Everything's going to be all right.

562
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:46,887
That's what you always say, isn't it?

563
01:00:47,488 --> 01:00:50,091
But when is it going to be all right, Randolph?

564
01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:53,097
When is it going to be all right?

565
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,212
I ain't never kissed a girl before.

566
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:20,418
Don't think like I'm a girl, you'd better remember that.

567
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,220
Get off of me. Get off of me.

568
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:28,228
You look so skinny and white.

569
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:35,337
Hey! Come back here!

570
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:55,960
"Dear Roger,
"I guess we're doing a lot more kissing and probably other things, too, ha ha...

571
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:59,661
"I told my father all about it. He thought it was swell.

572
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:05,269
"If you want to know what happened next, then you had better answer my letter."

573
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:17,984
You wanted to see me, Mr. Fever?

574
01:02:21,689 --> 01:02:27,296
The man built Skully's Landing --- he give me this.

575
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:33,904
He say it been in the Skully family a long time.

576
01:02:34,906 --> 01:02:39,511
Say he want it to always stay here at the Landing.

577
01:02:40,113 --> 01:02:45,119
You keep it --- Mr. Randolph, he didn't want it.

578
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:49,125
Gosh! --- Thank you, Mr. Fever.

579
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,131
What he see?

580
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:57,135
Answer me, cat!

581
01:02:58,438 --> 01:02:59,440
You see something?

582
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:04,336
Ain't got no time for to joke, cat.

583
01:03:08,141 --> 01:03:09,643
What's he laughing at, Zoo?

584
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:13,646
He been laughing for two days but he won't tell why.

585
01:03:13,948 --> 01:03:15,149
All he do is cough and laugh.

586
01:03:16,151 --> 01:03:18,154
I reckon the Lord told him something funny.

587
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:28,166
You'all --- it's getting powerful dark.

588
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:57,301
For Jesus, there were no mourners --- only Lil' Sunshine, who came to work his magic on the grave.

589
01:04:00,305 --> 01:04:01,406
I can't go.

590
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:04,711
I just got a feeling I got to stay.

591
01:04:06,214 --> 01:04:11,319
Whatever he did, even if he never loved me. I'll still stay 'til Dad dies.

592
01:04:13,624 --> 01:04:18,128
Honey baby, your Dad has been dead a long time.

593
01:04:19,131 --> 01:04:20,432
He just waiting to be buried.

594
01:04:29,142 --> 01:04:31,446
Promise me you'll leave one way or the other.

595
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:35,351
No, I can't promise. I can't.

596
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:13,396
And now I knew that I was here, and the whole world was out there

597
01:05:13,697 --> 01:05:17,301
And in between was all of time.

598
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:48,738
Missouri Fever will discover that all she has deserted is her proper place in a rather general puzzle.

599
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:55,747
We gave her a home. She's just like the rest of them.

600
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:58,150
Ungrateful and selfish.

601
01:05:59,453 --> 01:06:01,455
Perhaps if she had treated her better.

602
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,344
I treated her better than you did.

603
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,352
I've treated her like she was family.

604
01:06:12,453 --> 01:06:13,854
Heaven forbid!

605
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,359
Do we have any coffee?

606
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:23,768
If you two think I'm going to wait on you hand and foot, and take care of Ed,...

607
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:29,175
and take care of this entire house all by myself, then you're crazy.

608
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:32,379
And you can just make your own food.

609
01:06:39,189 --> 01:06:44,194
Do me a favor, my dear, dash up to my room and fetch me the sherry from my cupboard, will you?

610
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:19,836
I've decided that next year we'll sell my paintings in Europe.

611
01:07:20,738 --> 01:07:21,839
Would you like to see Paris in the spring?

612
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:25,744
Well, there's nothing like it.

613
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:31,752
Ven à Venice, London, the Galleries...

614
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:35,158
Idabell!

615
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:40,564
~ Where are you going? We must talk.
~ I haven't got time.

616
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:46,172
Time? Dear me.

617
01:07:47,574 --> 01:07:49,877
I thought that was where we were overstocked.

618
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:57,887
Idabell --- what's the matter!?

619
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:02,994
Daddy shot Henry. Dead as a doornail.

620
01:08:03,678 --> 01:08:05,297
Next it'll be me he gets rid of.

621
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,802
I ain't going to live with no Aunt Doris.

622
01:08:09,304 --> 01:08:11,307
Come with me, Joel, please!

623
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:13,610
Nobody's ever coming to get you.

624
01:08:13,812 --> 01:08:16,014
You're going to be stuck here all your life.

625
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:18,518
Please come with me! Please!

626
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,822
I can't, Idabell, I just can't.

627
01:08:22,224 --> 01:08:25,527
I want to know something --- what's going on in that house?

628
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,633
How come I don't never see nobody around?

629
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,236
Joel, how come I ain't never seen your Daddy?

630
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,842
I thought I was your friend.

631
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,846
Daddy, well, he's real sick.

632
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,951
He's dying of...yellow fever.

633
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:46,658
~ I don't want to run away with no liar, no way.
~ Idabell, wait!

634
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,662
Idabell, I'm telling the truth --- honest!

635
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:51,766
Where will we go?

636
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,805
Idabell said there was a traveling fair in the next town to Noon City.

637
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:27,509
We could cut through the swamp and hitch a ride with them.

638
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:32,215
We'd go to California and get jobs picking grapes...

639
01:09:32,316 --> 01:09:34,518
and find a preacher to marry us.

640
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:39,525
Goodbye, Father.

641
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:43,831
My only father.

642
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:56,146
Goodbye, Randolph.

643
01:10:03,815 --> 01:10:06,919
"If you got a thirst and the water done gone...

644
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,924
"Pray to the Lord, pray on and on.

645
01:10:11,726 --> 01:10:14,629
"If you got a hunger and the food done gone,...

646
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:18,736
"Pray to the Lord, pray on and on.

647
01:10:19,437 --> 01:10:26,545
"Hey Lord, hey Lord, hey Lord, tell me true..."

648
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:51,443
My sword!

649
01:11:52,846 --> 01:11:53,747
Leave it alone.

650
01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:55,750
Go on out.

651
01:12:01,657 --> 01:12:03,660
~ Get out of the water.
~ It bit me!

652
01:12:21,081 --> 01:12:22,382
I got to get you back to the Landing, quick!

653
01:12:40,103 --> 01:12:43,708
Help, somebody, please! Joel, he's been...Joel's been snakebit!

654
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:48,014
Somebody help! Joel's been snakebit!

655
01:12:50,718 --> 01:12:52,319
Help, Joel's been snakebit!

656
01:12:54,009 --> 01:12:55,324
Oh my God! Randolph!

657
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,829
~ What?
~ Joel's been snakebit!

658
01:13:15,248 --> 01:13:22,257
"Little ones to him belong.

659
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:31,468
"They all weak, but He is strong.

660
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:37,476
"Yes, Jesus loves me,...

661
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:47,989
"For the Bible tells me so."

662
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:51,794
How's Joel?

663
01:13:57,002 --> 01:13:58,203
He going to be all right.

664
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:02,309
He ain't come to, yet, he could have died, but the fever done broke

665
01:14:04,412 --> 01:14:06,014
I reckon that don't please you at all.

666
01:14:09,418 --> 01:14:10,419
What do you mean?

667
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:12,122
I mean what I said.

668
01:14:13,123 --> 01:14:14,124
How dare you say that to me?!

669
01:14:20,434 --> 01:14:21,435
You know what I was thinking...

670
01:14:22,137 --> 01:14:26,041
While them white boys were pounding me with their fists and their dicks?

671
01:14:28,345 --> 01:14:33,552
I was thinking that from then on, I ain't never going to be used again.

672
01:14:34,954 --> 01:14:37,257
I lay there, praying and crying...

673
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:43,965
and some kind of peace come over me, just washed over me like nice sweet cool water.

674
01:14:45,768 --> 01:14:46,969
And you know what that peace told me?

675
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:53,478
That peace told me, "Zoo, you ain't got to be a nigger if you don't want to be one.

676
01:14:55,148 --> 01:14:59,986
"You can be a fine Negro woman. It's up to you."

677
01:15:07,896 --> 01:15:13,303
For God's sake, can't you pour coffee, please?

678
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:19,110
I got to take Mr. Ed his breakfast. I think maybe you can pour your own coffee.

679
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,631
It's Zoo.

680
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:41,437
~ It's...
~ I didn't make it to the snow.

681
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:46,345
Now, I want you to eat this soup for me.

682
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:53,653
~ I tried to leave, too.
~ I know.

683
01:15:53,955 --> 01:15:55,056
Don't you talk, now.

684
01:16:04,869 --> 01:16:06,370
I have a gift for you.

685
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:25,593
I found this in a trunk in the attic.

686
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:31,701
I believe she would want you to have it.

687
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:50,123
I knew this was going to happen, and now it's too late to stop her coming.

688
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:52,427
Randolph, darling, what are we going to do?

689
01:16:59,436 --> 01:17:03,240
The world I came back to seemed lonelier than ever.

690
01:17:03,642 --> 01:17:09,301
Idabell had been sent away to live with her Aunt Doris, just as she'd always feared.

691
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:13,707
She'd come to say goodbye, but they wouldn't let her see me.

692
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:17,613
Thank you.

693
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:23,020
The Demarest Academy is a fine boarding school.

694
01:17:26,324 --> 01:17:34,233
If we had received your letter, I'm sure that Mr. Sansom would have delayed his business trip.

695
01:17:41,943 --> 01:17:43,745
Mr. Randolph? Is that you?

696
01:17:44,341 --> 01:17:47,350
It is I, and little Joel is with me.

697
01:17:48,052 --> 01:17:50,655
Well. it's a mighty long while since you come here, Mr. Randolph.

698
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:54,353
Not since you were a child, much like that sweet boy.

699
01:17:54,954 --> 01:17:56,556
You used to come toting your drawing book.

700
01:17:58,259 --> 01:18:02,063
Don't you know that if I came here as a child, then most of me never left?

701
01:18:02,565 --> 01:18:05,568
I've always been, so to speak, an unpaying guest.

702
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:08,172
At least I hope so.

703
01:18:08,373 --> 01:18:12,679
I should so dislike thinking that I'd left myself somewhere else.

704
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,184
We've come for Joel's charm.

705
01:18:16,385 --> 01:18:18,087
You have one made for him, haven't you?

706
01:18:18,288 --> 01:18:20,190
Oh, you bet I got it.

707
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,493
Good seeing you, Mr. Joel.

708
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,402
My Momma used to work here, cleaning this place.

709
01:18:29,503 --> 01:18:33,408
All her life she lifted and toted for the rich folks.

710
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:38,114
Told me she used to daydream about leaving here.

711
01:18:41,019 --> 01:18:43,721
Wanted me to amount to something, but I always knew...

712
01:18:43,823 --> 01:18:45,024
I'd never amount to nothing.

713
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:48,128
So I stayed here after everybody left.

714
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:54,037
In this here room --- I'm somebody!

715
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:58,543
And every night I looks to the heavens and I say...

716
01:18:58,644 --> 01:19:00,145
you lookee here, Momma,...

717
01:19:01,147 --> 01:19:03,450
this room is MINE!

718
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:05,443
Now ain't you proud!

719
01:19:12,253 --> 01:19:14,054
Tonight we drink to your outstanding success, my friend.

720
01:19:15,557 --> 01:19:17,159
You must drink with me.

721
01:19:21,364 --> 01:19:26,171
These are Joel's treasures. You know how little boys like to collect things.

722
01:19:26,272 --> 01:19:30,176
He brought some of them with him, but he just couldn't fit them all into his suitcase.

723
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,584
You know, I still can't understand why he hasn't written.

724
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:38,287
It's just not like Joel.

725
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:41,591
Oh, please --- please don't be upset.

726
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:44,997
I'll make sure he writes.

727
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:48,702
Thank you so very much for coming to visit us.

728
01:21:06,191 --> 01:21:08,394
Everything's going to be all right.

729
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,705
So long, Mr. Randolph.

730
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,509
~ So long, Joel.
~ Goodbye, my friend.

731
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:20,911
Look for me.

732
01:21:29,122 --> 01:21:36,430
I felt all through me a kind of balance, as though I understood Randolph absolutely.

733
01:21:36,531 --> 01:21:41,837
I saw how helpless he was, how like a child, how terribly alone.

734
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,541
Joel, where are you going?

735
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:51,951
We're losing the mule.

736
01:21:56,057 --> 01:21:59,861
Joel...Nature...

737
01:22:09,072 --> 01:22:10,645
What? Oh!

738
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:48,389
Randolph, I been thinking. My Dad has two sisters. They could take care of him.

739
01:22:49,592 --> 01:22:54,397
Then Amy and Zoo could live their own lives. And me and you'd be able to tour the world together.

740
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:57,601
We might even be able to catch up with Pepe.

741
01:22:59,304 --> 01:23:01,106
That would be some of your worries gone.

742
01:23:01,908 --> 01:23:04,707
I know that I shall never have an answer.

743
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:09,513
But it gives me something to believe in...and buys peace.

744
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:14,420
Listen to me, Randolph. We need to make plans.

745
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:22,731
Plans? Plans? The future to me is strangely unexciting, dear Joel.

746
01:23:23,433 --> 01:23:26,136
Imagination is the key to life.

747
01:23:27,538 --> 01:23:30,641
But what good is imagination if you don't have the guts to live it?

748
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,852
What's going to happen to us, Randolph?

749
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,462
So few things are fulfilled.

750
01:23:50,867 --> 01:23:54,171
It's wanting to know the end that makes us believe in Good --- or witchcraft.

751
01:23:55,874 --> 01:23:59,379
At least believe in something.

752
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:25,409
When we go to Pairs, I'm sure you'll...

753
01:24:28,803 --> 01:24:31,717
~ Amy!
~ Are you all right?

754
01:24:32,118 --> 01:24:33,420
~ Yes.
~ Aunt Ellen!

755
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:36,825
~ She came!
~ Joel, for heaven's sake.

756
01:24:38,028 --> 01:24:38,929
Give a hand, please.

757
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,635
Randolph --- you knew.

758
01:24:44,938 --> 01:24:46,339
Why didn't you tell me she was coming?

759
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:51,746
You see, boy, you mustn't become so emotional over such trivial things.

760
01:24:52,948 --> 01:24:54,651
Amy, why didn't you tell me?

761
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:57,655
Don't blame me --- none of this was my idea!

762
01:24:58,357 --> 01:24:59,258
Come on, Randolph, please.

763
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:05,466
I want to know the truth. Why do you two have my father here?

764
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:08,049
I'm not at all ashamed for what I did.

765
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:10,753
Believe me, he deserved what he got.

766
01:25:10,954 --> 01:25:12,757
What did you do to my father, Randolph?

767
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,762
Let go of me!

768
01:25:16,764 --> 01:25:17,865
Should have chucked you out years ago.

769
01:25:17,966 --> 01:25:19,768
What did you do to my father, Randolph?

770
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:20,970
He shot him.

771
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:23,875
That's what he did.

772
01:25:24,076 --> 01:25:29,782
He shot him. And then he brought him back here.

773
01:25:30,785 --> 01:25:32,987
And he didn't even call a doctor.

774
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:37,393
She doesn't know what she's saying!

775
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:50,109
He's been laying upstairs in that bed for nine years.

776
01:25:50,911 --> 01:25:54,515
While I tended to him. While I wasted my life.

777
01:25:55,617 --> 01:26:00,122
He didn't desert us. He couldn't come home because he couldn't get out of that bed.

778
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:06,230
I would have told you everything. If only we...we had more time.

779
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:09,535
More time to talk.

780
01:26:09,836 --> 01:26:11,839
Then why did you send for me?

781
01:26:13,942 --> 01:26:16,345
I was trying to atone for what I'd done.

782
01:26:19,949 --> 01:26:20,850
Forgive me.

783
01:26:22,854 --> 01:26:23,955
You made me like you.

784
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:28,962
I loved you.

785
01:26:43,981 --> 01:26:46,183
I wanted you to be happy here.

786
01:26:50,689 --> 01:26:51,966
You're a liar, Randolph.

787
01:26:55,671 --> 01:26:57,774
I hate you. You're a liar.

788
01:27:34,617 --> 01:27:40,024
Someone was coming towards me --- a reek of sweat and cheap cologne.

789
01:27:41,026 --> 01:27:44,830
Who was it? Ed? Shouting at me!

790
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:50,137
There was a blinding light gripping me, shaking me.

791
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,942
Pepe could have been a world champion.

792
01:27:58,248 --> 01:28:00,751
When I remembered that Dolores kept a gun hidden under her bed,...

793
01:28:02,754 --> 01:28:05,858
Havana could be a dangerous place.

794
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:10,864
I warned him, but still he came towards me.

795
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:18,975
Shouting: "Pepe hated you! Despised you!

796
01:28:19,777 --> 01:28:23,481
"All those presents: gold watches, silk shirts...

797
01:28:26,285 --> 01:28:30,289
"And all the time...he was laughing at you."

798
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:42,504
Suddenly, I couldn't listen anymore.

799
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:48,112
With a squeeze of the trigger...

800
01:28:51,518 --> 01:28:52,919
I would be free.

801
01:28:58,926 --> 01:28:59,927
Free to hope.

802
01:29:04,534 --> 01:29:05,835
Free to dream.

803
01:29:21,254 --> 01:29:25,141
Randolph --- you forgot my birthday!

804
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:35,254
Well, it feels like my birthday.

805
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,258
My father didn't do anything to hurt you, did he?

806
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,464
I mean, Pepe ran out on the both of you.

807
01:29:44,267 --> 01:29:46,870
Forgive me, Joel. Forgive me.

808
01:29:47,973 --> 01:29:50,075
Maybe a letter did reach him.

809
01:29:50,276 --> 01:29:51,578
He just didn't see any sense in responding.

810
01:29:51,879 --> 01:29:53,781
It'd be like writing to a ghost.

811
01:29:57,586 --> 01:29:58,687
You must forgive me.

812
01:30:01,091 --> 01:30:02,092
Tell me that you do.

813
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:09,192
I was hoping we'd have more time.

814
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:12,396
Maybe if you'd gotten help for my father, he wouldn't be in that dark attic.

815
01:30:12,998 --> 01:30:14,299
Maybe he could tell me he loved me.

816
01:30:16,903 --> 01:30:17,704
I couldn't.

817
01:30:19,106 --> 01:30:23,212
I couldn't. They'd lock me up. I would die.

818
01:30:25,816 --> 01:30:28,318
But you are locked up already.

819
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,121
Don't you realize?

820
01:30:30,523 --> 01:30:32,325
We're all locked up.

821
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:36,430
Don't leave me.

822
01:30:44,141 --> 01:30:44,942
Don't go.

823
01:31:04,245 --> 01:31:06,968
I told Zoo I'd come back and get her.

824
01:31:18,882 --> 01:31:20,284
Everything's going to be all right.

825
01:31:29,295 --> 01:31:30,997
But I never did come back.

826
01:31:32,199 --> 01:31:39,408
My father died that winter, and his body was sent back to New Orleans to lie alongside that of my mother.

827
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:43,213
But part of me did stay at the Landings.

828
01:31:44,215 --> 01:31:51,223
And wherever I go, whatever I do, that voice never leaves me.
