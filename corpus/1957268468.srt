00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,103
Hey, come here.

185
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:22,497

189
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:27,719
You stupid psycho.

206
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:38,834
You did good.

207
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:46,189
Officer said there
was four of 'em.

208
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:49,758
You defended yourself.

209
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:50,933
- Stop.
- What?

210
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,067
Come on, it's not like you
killed them, they deserved it.

211
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,200
That's not what the
police report says.

212
00:11:57,243 --> 00:12:00,203
It's their word, four
of them, against mine.

213
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:00,986
Doesn't matter.

214
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,466
Yeah, it does.

215
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,250
I used a sleeper
hold on one of them.

216
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:06,644
I could've killed him
and it's your fault.

217
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:08,167
I mean, what if you didn't
know how to defend yourself?

218
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,212
Dad, stop.

219
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:11,649
Stop.

220
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:13,651
I didn't just defend
myself, I'm the freak

221
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,348
who leveled four guys
without a scratch.

222
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,829
I mean, who does that?

223
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,963
I mean, you know
I'm not mad, right?

224
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,355
No.

225
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,661
You're proud.

226
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,707
What type of parent are you?

227
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,099
Oh, and you froze
my credit cards?

228
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,535
Did you think that was funny?

229
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,059
You've been ignoring
me for months.

230
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:32,496
I'm having you removed as
a cosigner on my accounts.

231
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:33,497
I wanted to see you.

232
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,672
Now you've seen me.

233
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:36,195
Take me back to campus now.

234
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,893
Come on, it's your spring
break, you're going home.

235
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,634
Well, I have studying
I need to catch up on.

236
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,201
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

237
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,814
Look, we're going home,
it's been too long.

238
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,512
No, not long enough.

239

Hey, we're home.

243
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:09,751
Come on.

[Cal sighs]

249
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:32,382
[Cal] Hungry?

250
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:33,992
I'll fix you something to eat.

251
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:34,863
No.

252
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:42,740
Oh, Scarlett.

253
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:45,134

Morning!

259
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,377
Hey, you want some cereal?

260
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:14,076
I could make you something else.

261

262
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:20,386

Fine, I guess.

268
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,577
Sorry, I've been out of town.

269
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:42,278
Yeah, I can go out later
and get some groceries.

270
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,976
So, how was your trip?

271
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,456
Business good?

[Cal chuckles]

273
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:52,157
Reminds me, I got
you a little something.

274
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:56,205
Consider it a late
birthday present.

275

[paper rustling]

276
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,520

What?

278
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,570
Feel it, the weight is amazing.

Blade.

280
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,746
- Sharp.
- Yes.

281
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,230
What am I gonna
do with this? I...

282
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:26,191
What about clothes or gift
cards, just something practical?

283
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,847
No, I mean, it's special.

284
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:30,761
To you.

285
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,898
I'm gonna go for a walk.

go to Grandma's house.

295
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,093

Go right to Grandma's
house, you got it?

00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,862
Breathe, breathe.

370
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:29,734
[heavy breathing]

371
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,935

00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,281
[light dramatic music]

376
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:41,110
[Boy] Oh, he
means it all right.

377
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:42,328
- The dog-
- Dad!

378
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:44,679
What's Grandma's address?

379
00:25:44,722 --> 00:25:45,810
Again?

380
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,638
Humor me. What is it?

381
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:51,512
19 Boarcrest Road in
Cayhill, wherever that is.

382
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:52,513
You can look it up.

383
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:53,601
And what's it for?

384
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:56,125
- Can I finish the show?
- Scarlett.

385
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:59,433
If there's ever an emergency
you'll tell me to go there.

386
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,477
That's right, and
you'll wait for me

387
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:02,566
until I get there, right?

388
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,004
Why do you call
it that when I don't

389
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,745
have any grandmothers left?

390
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:09,486
It's exactly why
I call it that.

391
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,794
We'll be safe there
in case we need it.

392
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:17,407
[Boy] Better not
scare the fish away.

393
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,671
[light dramatic music]

394
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,727
Hello?

395
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:35,773
Dad?

396
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:59,493

[Scarlett sighs]

401
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:01,859
Come on, Dad.

[thudding]
[Cal groaning]

409
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:54,259
He's not coming.

410
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:57,567
[light dramatic music]

411
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,051
[phone beeping]

412
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,405
[Cal] Come on, keep up!

413
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,536
How are you ever
gonna outrun somebody

414
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,712
if you get in trouble?

415
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,278
[Scarlett] Or I
could call the police.

416
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,671
Hey!

417
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:16,455
We talked about that.

418
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:18,109
You know, you're the
only parent who encourages

419
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:20,068
their daughter not to dial 911.

420
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:22,853
Okay, well, if you're hurt
or if there's a fire, yes,

421
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:25,377
call them, but if it's
another dangerous situation

422
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:27,902
just protect yourself
and get away.

423
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,817
Yeah, because you don't
like the questions like,

424
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,297
"Hey, Dad, where'd
you go last week?"

425
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:33,777
You know I can't
talk about that.

426
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:35,387
Yeah, all I'm allowed
to know is you work

427
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:37,302
for the government
and carry a gun.

428
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,739
Fine.

429
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:40,262
How's Syria this time of year?

430
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:41,611
Come on, cut it out.

431
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,786
What, you can't
stop me from watching

432
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,745
the news and guessing.

433
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:45,963
Scarlett.

434
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:47,573
Okay, I get it.
Don't call the police.

435
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:48,444
Whatever.

436
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:50,620
Good sprint!

437
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,405

[phone ringing]

453
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,389
Hello?

454
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,086
[Man] You must be Scarlett.

455
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,392
Who is this?

456
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:53,134
[Man] I'm the man
who has your father.

457
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,700
I wanna talk to him.

458
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,790
[Man] And I bet he's dying
to talk to you, too, Red.

459
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,443
I'd love to reunite
the two of you,

460
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:02,317
so, do me a favor, just
sit tight, all right?

461
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,536
We'll come pick you up so
you can see your father.

[suspenseful music]

470
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:53,455

483
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,728
- [dramatic music]
- Stop right there.

Where's my dad?

496
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,609
Probably dead.

497
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,135
Why did you take him?

498
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,268
Who are you?

499
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,490
Who do you work for?

500
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:59,755
[man spits]
[Scarlett grunts]

501
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,974
Where's my dad?

502
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,412
I'll tell you nothing.

503
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:07,284
[hand slapping]

504
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:10,548
I'm gonna rip your hair
out and make you eat it.

00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:12,289
[heavy breathing]

506

[suspenseful music]

507
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:17,251
Last chance.

508
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:22,038
Careful, don't hurt
yourself with that.

509
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,779
You won't shoot me.

510
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:27,261
[suspenseful music]

511
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:29,176
Don't tempt me.

00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:38,489
That's it.

515
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,753
Hands up, a little
more here, okay.

516
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:44,756
Good. It's a little
more comfortable, right?

517
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,107
Okay, good, you remember
what we talked about?

518
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,763
Both eyes open at all
times, aim, breathe evenly,

519
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:54,418
time your shot with your breath
for better accuracy, right?

520
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:55,376
Okay.

521
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,507
Okay, good.

522
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,207
[gun clicks]

523
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,122
Fire when you're ready.

524
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:05,473
[gun bangs]

525
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,787
I had plans, you know.

526
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,615
Guy with a stud in his tongue?

527
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,182
Who knows where else?

528
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:20,879
Come on, that is not plans.

529
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:22,403
Okay, well this?

530
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,361
This is probably going
to get me in trouble

531
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,102
just like everything else.

532
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:29,149
Okay, but not if you
know what you're doing.

533
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,890
Come on, this is
quality bonding time.

534
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:33,153
Okay, well we do
this a lot more than

535
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,981
I get to go out and
do normal things.

536
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:38,419
Okay, well this, this here.

537
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:43,250
[gun bangs]
[metal clinks]

538
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:45,817
Makes me cool dad
of the year, no?

539
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:50,170
You're way out of touch
with what I think is cool.

540
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:54,348
Ah, this is great.

541
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:57,133
The grouping's fantastic.

542
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:58,134
If you keep this up-

543
00:36:58,178 --> 00:36:59,396
- I don't wanna keep it up,

544
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,660
or keep coming here and
being someone I'm not.

545
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:05,010
Why, stop it, Scarlett.

546
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:06,316
[Scarlett sighs]

547
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,013
Keys, Dad.

548
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:10,451
Hey, I know this
is unusual for you.

549
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,235
You think because I can
shoot at a pinned up target

550
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:15,020
I can, what, shoot a person?

551
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:18,763
Why would I even want
to shoot someone?

552
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:21,679
You don't know what you
might have to do someday.

553
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,681
Why do you want this for me?

554
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,944
[Cal] To keep you safe.

555
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:27,250
[Scarlett sighs]

556
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:29,992
Gee, at least I'm not
locked up in the house,

557
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:31,689
get to see sunlight.

558
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,954
- Awesome.
- Okay, cut it out, Scarlett.

559
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:37,260
This is not easy for me.

560
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:38,305
What isn't?

561
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:40,045
Raising you.

562
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:44,006
Being a father, being
away, worrying about you.

563
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:49,098
Look, I wish your mother
was still here, okay?

564
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:52,928
But you are stuck with me.

565
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,280
No, you worry about me
but you're gone on and off

566
00:37:57,324 --> 00:37:58,890
3/4 of the year, so...

567
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:01,371
If you're so worried about
me why don't you just remarry

568
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:03,852
or get a girlfriend
to check in on me?

569
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:05,723
It is too late for that.

570
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,160
It's too late
for a lotta things.

571
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,336
Look, I don't trust anyone.

572
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:10,815
Okay, not like that.

573
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,688
And I'm not gonna risk bringing
someone into our lives.

574
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:17,126
I thought you were a
decent judge of character.

575
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,520
Why don't you just
quit your job?

576
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,696
I mean, wouldn't that be
better for both of us?

577
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:24,481
No more secrets, no more me
not knowing what you're doing

578
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,701
and you worrying about me.

579
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:30,313
I'm good at what I do.

580
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:33,098
Someone's gotta do it.

581
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:36,232
So let someone else do it.

582
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:37,538
Well, no matter what
I do I'm not gonna

583
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,583
stop worrying about you.

584
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:43,239
I'll drive. Get in the car.

585
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:49,506
[dramatic whooshing]

586
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,814
[light dramatic music]

587
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:57,166
[McDowell] Get up.

588
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:00,735
[man groans]

589
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,171
Where's Walker?

590
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:04,956
[man sighs]

591
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,827
Sweet.

592
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:08,612
[phone beeps]

593
00:39:08,656 --> 00:39:10,092
[phone ringing]

594
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:11,920
[Man] The girl?

595
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:13,051
She got away.

596
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:14,923
[Man] Interesting.

597
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:16,272
Walker's dead.

598
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:19,188
[Man] You underestimated her.

599
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,538
Get back here, I
have another option.

600
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:22,409
Okay.

601
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,977
[man sighs]

602
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,805
Help me with the body.

603
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:28,980
[suspenseful music]

604
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,853
[engine rumbling]

605
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,208
[light dramatic music]

606
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,081
[engine rumbling]

607
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:50,175
[light dramatic music]

608
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:00,490
[Cal] How do you tell when
someone's following you?

609
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:01,752
What?

610
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:03,450
How do you tell?

611
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:04,973
Dad, not now.

612
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,496
Come on, you
check your mirrors.

613
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,891
If you see the same car they're
gonna turn when you turn.

614
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:11,893
We are just going
out to dinner.

615
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:14,069
And they'll try
and match your speed.

616
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,593
I'm a little old for
a driving lesson, okay?

617
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:17,768
This is important.

618
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:20,423
That's what you always say.

619
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,033
Come on, what if you
have a stalker boyfriend.

620
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:24,166
How you gonna tell
if he follows you?

621
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,777
Should've just ordered pizza.

622
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:29,214
[dramatic music]

623
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:32,479
[light dramatic music]

624
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:41,183
Follow too closely
and you'll be seen.

625
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:48,973
[engine rumbling]
[light dramatic music]

626
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:07,601
Just because he speeds up,
doesn't mean I have to.

627
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:16,566
If he speeds up
suddenly, he spotted me.

628
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:26,359
[engine rumbling]

629
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:31,755

630
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,410

[suspenseful music]

632
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:41,417
[zipper buzzes]

633
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:10,446
[suspenseful music]

634
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,057
[door squeaks]

635
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:17,671
[man groaning]

636
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:28,595

637
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:39,736

638
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:44,001
[man grunts]

639
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:46,264
[ground rustling]

640
00:42:46,308 --> 00:42:48,005
[suspenseful music]

641
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:48,963
[Scarlett gasps]

642
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:51,922

643
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:53,358

[body thuds]

645
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,322
Sanches, is that you?

646
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:02,672
Sanches?

647
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,458
Dawson?

648
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:08,199
[Man] Garza, go
check that out.

649
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:11,246
[suspenseful music]

650
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,264
[light dramatic music]

651
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:31,875

[McDowell groans]

655
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,803
[Scarlett panting]

656
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:51,852
[man groaning]
[fist thudding]

657
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:57,597
[heavy breathing]
[suspenseful music]

658
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,561
[heavy breathing]

659
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:09,304
[Oloski] You'll tell
me one way or another.

660
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:12,655
Where did he put it?

661
00:44:13,656 --> 00:44:16,137
[Man] I don't... I don't know.

662
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,314
Please, I told you
everything I know.

663
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:24,275
[Oloski] It's just
not good enough.

664
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,627
Let's see if you can
remember anything else.

665
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,280
[Man] No, no, no, come on.

666
00:44:29,324 --> 00:44:30,499
[Oloski] Where's the vial?

667
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,892
- I don't know.
- The cetus virus.

668
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,458
[Man] I don't know.

669
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:34,590
I don't know.

670
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:35,722
[Oloski] Serious question.

671
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:36,940
[Man] What?

672
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:38,246
[Oloski] How well
can you tolerate pain?

673
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:40,944
[man screaming]

674
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:44,948
Stop!
[dramatic music]

675
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:46,036
Put the gun down.

676
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,603
Put it down, both of you.

677
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:48,473
You, too.

678
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:50,998
Back up.

679
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:51,868
Back up!

680
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,655
Are you lost?

681
00:44:56,656 --> 00:44:57,613
Dad?

682
00:44:57,657 --> 00:44:58,701
Dad?

683
00:44:58,745 --> 00:45:00,485
[dramatic music]
[man panting]

684
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:01,878
Is that your dad?

685
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,665
[light dramatic music]

686
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:06,753
Let him go.

687
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:08,581
Yeah, yeah do that.

688
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:11,496
No.
[gun bangs]

689
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,151
[Oloski groans]
[dramatic music]

690
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:15,283
Don't move.

691
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:17,459
Don't move.

692
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:21,115
Who are you?

693
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:22,682
- Where's my dad?
- What?

694
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:24,074
Cal, his name is Cal.

695
00:45:24,118 --> 00:45:25,423
Hey, look out.
[gun banging]

696
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:27,425
Move!
[dramatic music]

697
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:30,298
- Go!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

698
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:31,560
This way!

699
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,345

[heavy breathing]

702
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:47,402
Now what?

703
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,664
I'm still figuring it out.

704
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,711
What do you mean
figuring it out?

705
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:52,929
What kind of rescue is this?

706
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:54,539
I wasn't planning
on rescuing you.

707
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:59,588
[gun banging]
[dramatic music]

708
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:04,245
[suspenseful music]

709
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,693
They're still on the property.

710
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:18,607
Find 'em.

711
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,351
Here, here, passenger side.

712
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:28,399
[door thudding]
[engine rumbling]

713
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:31,359
[heavy breathing]

714
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:33,491
Hey, thanks for the uh-

715
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:34,710
- Yeah.

716
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:37,539
You know, the
saving me and stuff.

717
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:41,674
I'm Sean, by the way.

718
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:42,718
Scarlett.

719
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:44,415
Hey, Scarlett.

720
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:47,027
Hey, is Cal your dad?

721
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,941
Have you seen him?

722
00:46:47,984 --> 00:46:50,508
No, no, he's just, no, nuh uh.

723
00:46:50,552 --> 00:46:52,423
I think they have him
in maybe another place

724
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:53,250
- or something.
- Where?

725
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:54,164
I don't know.

726
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,688
- You must!
- No.

727
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:57,690
No, I don't know where he's
at, I haven't heard anything.

728
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:58,560
Sorry.

729
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:01,084
Yeah, I just...

730
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:05,393
I think the bleeding's
slowing down, but it stings.

731
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:08,439
You okay?

732
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:10,485
I don't know.

733
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,792
Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine.

734
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:17,361
[light dramatic music]

735
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,626
[Sean groans]

736
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,715
Nice.

737
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,847
[bag rustling]

738
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:25,718
Here.

739
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:27,937
Start with this.

740
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:30,461
Thanks.

741
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:35,292
How do you know my dad?

742
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:36,729
I got him some information.

743
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,165
[Scarlett] How?

744
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:40,733
Some illegal ways
that may or may not

745
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,692
have involved code
on the internet.

746
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:47,087
You know what he does, right?

747
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,480
Yeah, I have an idea.

748
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:50,960
Well, I got him
some information about

749
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:55,138
a biological weapon that
was being sold as a virus.

750
00:47:56,313 --> 00:47:58,446
Something those guys
called this weird name

751
00:47:58,489 --> 00:47:59,969
like Cetus or something.

752
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:01,710
Anyway, Cal went after it.

753
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,712
So what are you, an informant?

754
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,496
[Sean chuckles]

755
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,716
Something like that.

756
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,892
And those guys?

757
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:12,503
Guessing arms dealers.

758
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:14,810
And how did they get to you?

759
00:48:14,854 --> 00:48:15,985
I don't know.

760
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,291
One moment I'm chilling
drinking a coffee

761
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:20,120
and the next they
grabbed me and...

762
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,732
You're the last person I
expected to show up, though.

763
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,125
You know?

764
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,343
Who were you expecting?

765
00:48:26,387 --> 00:48:27,780
[Sean groans]

766
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,043
I don't know, maybe
some of Cal's associates

767
00:48:30,086 --> 00:48:32,610
or another agent or something.

768
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,006
Actually, I wasn't expecting
them to take him down.

769
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,486
What do you mean?

770
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:42,533
I mean, I don't mean
down, I mean find him.

771
00:48:42,577 --> 00:48:43,839
I didn't know, I passed
on some information

772
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:44,840
that must've been
enough to track.

773
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:46,189
You told them about my dad?

774
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,190
- I didn't have a choice.
- That was you?

775
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:48,801
I didn't have a choice!

776
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:51,804
They came after
us because of you!

777
00:48:52,892 --> 00:48:54,371
I'm sorry, I...

778
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:57,548
I'm not all trained
in this sort of thing.

779
00:48:57,592 --> 00:49:00,421
I'm a little in
over my head here.

780
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:05,252
You're gonna help
me get him back.

781
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:06,688
Ow, oh!

782
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:08,646
- Come on.
- You owe him.

783
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,213
I owe him?

784
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:11,736
He got me into this.

785
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,173
I thought you were the
one who told him about it.

786
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,392
Besides, you betrayed him,
you put him in danger.

787
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:16,829
And me, too!

788
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:18,743
Now you're gonna
help me get him back.

789
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:20,136
I hate to break it to you,

790
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,529
but this intimidation
thing you do is much better

791
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,139
for your dad than it is for you.

792
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:26,055
You're holding a 50 cent
bandage over my head.

793
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:29,276
Very convincing,
I've changed my mind!

794
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:33,106
[Sean sighs]

795
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:36,718
Here, let me... let me see.

796
00:49:38,198 --> 00:49:39,025
All right.

797
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,028
It's not that deep.

798
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:43,246
[Sean] It's not?

799
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,117
No.

800
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,642
All right, just apply pressure.

801
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,817
Yep, right there.

802
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,123
Okay, thanks.

803
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:53,953
[light dramatic music]

804
00:49:53,996 --> 00:49:56,129
Did you see him at all?

805
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,567
No.

806
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,749
He's tough, though,
he'll survive, you know?

807
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,972
I'm the only one
looking for him.

808
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:18,020
[light dramatic music]
[birds chirping]

809
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:26,768
Train station is up ahead.

810
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:32,774
Yeah, it's good, you can
just drop me off right there.

811
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:35,646
[engine rumbling]

812
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,214
[brakes squeaking]

813
00:50:38,258 --> 00:50:39,041
Here.

814
00:50:41,522 --> 00:50:44,829
This might not draw as
much attention as...

815
00:50:44,873 --> 00:50:47,223
[chuckles] Yeah, thanks.

816
00:50:47,267 --> 00:50:48,050
Yep.

817
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:52,489
You know, you should run.

818
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:53,708
I would, I am.

819
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:56,754
That's your choice.

820
00:50:58,408 --> 00:50:59,453
Yeah, okay.

821
00:51:01,411 --> 00:51:04,849
You know, maybe this
virus thing these guys

822
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:06,329
are looking for is the
thing that Cal has.

823
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:08,331
Maybe it's your ticket
outta here, you know?

824
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:11,247
You find it and trade
it for him and...

825
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,075
Unless it's labeled
deadly virus I don't know

826
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,468
what I'm looking for.

827
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:15,860
Besides, if it's
that big of a deal-

828
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:18,689
[sirens wailing]

829
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,693
[Scarlett sighs]

830
00:51:22,737 --> 00:51:25,131
How are you gonna find Cal?

831
00:51:26,436 --> 00:51:28,177
I'll figure it out.

832
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:31,311
Look, if I had any information
I would totally help-

833
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,747
- It's fine.

834
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,270
It's fine, I get it.

835
00:51:34,314 --> 00:51:37,795
I mean, I owe you one,
you know, for everything.

836
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,754
Don't worry about it.

837
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:43,540
[sighs] Okay.

838
00:51:49,198 --> 00:51:51,984
[light music]

839
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,029
[door thuds]

840
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:55,117
[Sean sighs]

841
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:57,554
[head thudding]

842
00:51:57,598 --> 00:51:58,947
I must be crazy.

843
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:06,607
[light music]
[birds chirping]

844
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,392
[door squeaking]

845
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,353
[bag rustling]

846
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,832
Safe house, nice.

847
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:18,010
Something like that.

848
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:22,492
He has got everything.

849
00:52:22,536 --> 00:52:24,625
Whoa, are those grenades?

850
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:29,630
Hey, has he been here recently?

851
00:52:29,673 --> 00:52:30,892
I don't know.

852
00:52:30,935 --> 00:52:32,763
Well, maybe it's
here, did you check?

853
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:35,114
Wouldn't he of handed
it off to somebody else?

854
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:37,812
[Sean] Well, it depends.
Let's look around.

855
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:38,987
It's a biological weapon,

856
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,989
I have no idea
where he'd store it.

857
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,773
Well, those guys were
asking a lot about Cal,

858
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,079
how well I knew him.

859
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:45,646
They talked like he
knew where it was.

860
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:47,778
For some reason they think
he still has it somewhere.

861
00:52:47,822 --> 00:52:51,869
Well, it doesn't do me
any good if I can't find it.

862
00:52:51,913 --> 00:52:53,132
Well, I can help you look.

863
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:56,831
I mean, it's cool. We
can find it together.

864
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,441
- Okay.
- All right.

865
00:53:01,531 --> 00:53:06,536
[light music]
[fire sizzling]

866
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,935
Your dad's got issues.

867
00:53:18,374 --> 00:53:21,247
[book thuds]
Ooh.

868
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,249
I am willing to open
this up just to see

869
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:26,121
if Cal stashed anything inside.

870
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:27,818
We don't have time for that.

871
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:29,124
Yeah, we do.

872
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:31,126
I need food. I haven't
eaten for like two days.

873
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,519
Here.

874
00:53:32,562 --> 00:53:34,260
My dad is missing and-

875
00:53:34,303 --> 00:53:35,130
- Eat.

876
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:42,746
So, you work for your dad?

877
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:43,617
No.

878
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,010
You just know how
to handle yourself

879
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:48,274
in case a date gets
handsy or something?

880
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:50,754
My weekends were different
than most growing up.

881
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:52,234
[dramatic whooshing]

882
00:53:52,278 --> 00:53:54,018
[fists thudding]
[Scarlett grunting]

883
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:55,324
[Cal] Tired?

884
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:56,891
No.

885
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,284
You're lagging.

886
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:01,113
Excellent, that's it.

887
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:05,595
Come on.
[fists thudding]

888
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:09,512
[Scarlett grunting]
Come on.

889
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:11,253
Good, good, keep
it up. That's it!

890
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:12,254
Come on, one more of them.

891
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,517
Take it back, I am tired.

892
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:15,475
[Scarlett sighs]

893
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,825
Come on, five more minutes.

894
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:19,827
Come on.

895
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,656
[sighs] Okay.

896
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,006
What's on your mind, huh?

897
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:27,226
- Nothing.
- Humor me.

898
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:28,662
[fist thudding]

899
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:30,229
What is it?

900
00:54:30,272 --> 00:54:32,666
[fist thudding]
[Scarlett grunting]

901
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:35,234
Have you ever killed someone?

902
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:37,453
I can't talk about that.

903
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:40,587
It figures.

904
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,544
[fist thudding]

905
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:42,893
Why do you wanna know?

906
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:44,460
I think I should, don't you?

907
00:54:44,504 --> 00:54:46,419
I mean, what are you
always training me for?

908
00:54:46,462 --> 00:54:47,811
Not to kill.

909
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:48,682
Really?

910
00:54:49,596 --> 00:54:51,032
[Cal sighs]

911
00:54:51,075 --> 00:54:54,601
When it comes down to
it, of course I want it

912
00:54:54,644 --> 00:54:59,649
to be the other guy, but
this is for your protection.

913
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:00,694
Right.

914
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:03,087
[Cal] Good, good.

915
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:04,176
You haven't
answered my question.

916
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:08,223
Well.
[fists thudding]

917
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,791
[light dramatic music]
[Scarlett grunting]

918
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:12,662
Control, control.

919
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:15,448
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down!

920
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:18,320
[heavy breathing]

921
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,675
Yes.

922
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:28,200
[light music]

923
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,202
How many?

924
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:33,117
I won't tell you that.

925
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:39,733
Doesn't it bother you?

926
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:45,173
Not as much as it should.

927
00:55:46,522 --> 00:55:49,656
[dramatic whooshing]

928
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:54,051
Your dad never
told me about you.

929
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:56,532
I didn't think
you two were close.

930
00:55:56,576 --> 00:56:00,841
Besides, isn't everything
super secret all the time?

931
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:07,630
So it's just the two of you?

932
00:56:07,674 --> 00:56:09,850
My mom died when I was eight.

933
00:56:09,893 --> 00:56:11,068
[Sean] From his job?

934
00:56:11,112 --> 00:56:12,635
What? No.

935
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:14,463
She got sick.

936
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:16,160
So he raised you.

937
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:19,381
If you call it that.

938
00:56:22,863 --> 00:56:24,125
What about you?

939
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:25,996
What about me?

940
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,955
Well, I know
nothing about you.

941
00:56:27,998 --> 00:56:31,437
Other than you've
worked with my dad.

942
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,006
Well, I grew up under less
than ideal circumstances.

943
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:38,748
Had a few run ins with the law

944
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:43,318
'cause of my computer skills,
but I turned out okay.

945
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:46,234
Pretty good at
gettin' outta scrapes.

946
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,367
[chuckles] Well, I
mean, everybody's

947
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,586
got their off day, right?

948
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,373
I'm more of a
information middleman.

949
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:56,723
It's how I met your dad.

950
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:59,595
I thought it would
be a safer gig.

951
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:05,906
[light dramatic music]
[birds chirping]

952
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:08,256
[rustling]

953
00:57:10,084 --> 00:57:11,215
Whatcha doin'?

954
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:12,913
I'm making a deal.

955
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:17,047
I'm telling them we'll
get them what they want.

956
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:18,745
My dad for the vial.

957
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:20,747
[phone clicking]

958
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,097
Or I'm going to the police.

959
00:57:26,274 --> 00:57:28,929
[phone dings]

960
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:30,322
What's it say?

961
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:33,063
You have until tomorrow night

962
00:57:33,107 --> 00:57:37,329
or we're dropping off
his body for the cops.

963
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:39,940
[light dramatic music]

964
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:40,897
[engine rumbling]

965
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:42,595
Were you expecting somebody?

966
00:57:42,638 --> 00:57:45,162
[suspenseful music]

967
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:48,035
That car, it was
outside the house.

968
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:49,515
It's them, it's gotta be.

969
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:52,344
[dramatic music]

970
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,179
[thudding]
[heavy breathing]

971
00:58:02,223 --> 00:58:03,137
Finger off the trigger.

972
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,573
Right.

973
00:58:04,617 --> 00:58:06,314
- Don't point it at my face!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

974
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,576
Oh, god.

975
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,272
What do we do, what do
we do, what do we do?

976
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:08,925
Shut up!

977
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:11,711
[dramatic music]

978
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:19,153

981
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:33,428
Freeze, don't move!
[gun clicks]

982
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,256
Right there behind the couch.

983
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:36,736
I see 'em!

984
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,434
Drop the gun, put your
hands where I can see 'em.

985
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:40,435
What do we do?

986
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,523
[Man] Let me see your hands!

987
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:42,959
- Put it down.
- Show me your hands!

988
00:58:43,003 --> 00:58:44,178
- Come on!
- Put the gun down!

989
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,442
I'm not gonna tell you
again. Put it down!

990
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:52,142
Okay, okay, okay.
[suspenseful music]

991

[dramatic music]

993
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:02,239
Get down.
[guns banging]

994
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:06,635
Take cover, now, now!
[dramatic music]

995
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:12,380
Come on, out the back!
[guns banging]

996
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:16,863
Don't stop, keep moving.

997
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:22,651
Get down, get down.

998
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,481
[gun banging]

999
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:28,396
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

[gun banging]
[gas hissing]

1001

1002
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:36,883
Oh shi-
[booming]

1003
00:59:39,886 --> 00:59:44,891
[fire crackling]
[light dramatic music]

1004

[heavy breathing]

1006
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:01,951
You okay? You all right?

1007
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:03,257
I don't know.

1008
01:00:04,432 --> 01:00:06,695
Oh jeez, you're hurt.

1009
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:08,044
Hold on.

1010
01:00:08,088 --> 01:00:08,915
Hold on.

1011
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:11,831
Here, here, put this on.

1012
01:00:13,093 --> 01:00:15,269
- Yeah.
- Who were they?

1013
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,184
Those are the guys
who got your dad.

1014
01:00:17,227 --> 01:00:18,707
How did they find us?

1015
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:21,057
I mean, I told them I'd
get them what they want

1016
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:23,277
and then, and then
they attacked.

1017
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,453
Does... does that mean
they killed my dad?

1018
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,411
No, no, no, don't think that.

1019
01:00:27,455 --> 01:00:30,284
[heavy breathing]

1020
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:36,551
Those men.

1021
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:40,076
Those men are dead.
[somber music]

1022
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,295
[Sean] Yeah.

1023
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:44,080
Pull over.

1024
01:00:44,124 --> 01:00:45,952
- Pull over.
- Okay, okay, hold on.

1025
01:00:45,995 --> 01:00:48,781
[engine rumbling]

1026
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,742
[Scarlett pukes]

1027
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,355
[somber music]

1028
01:00:58,399 --> 01:01:00,227
I got you, I got you.

1029
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:02,272
You okay?

1030
01:01:02,316 --> 01:01:03,317
- Okay.
- Oh.

1031
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:06,581
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

1032
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:07,713
[Scarlett cries]
You did exactly

1033
01:01:07,756 --> 01:01:09,584
what you were supposed to do.

1034
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:12,108
Those guys were gonna kill us.

1035
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:13,501
- I know.
- Yeah.

1036
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:16,852
You know what else?

1037
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:20,073
You did what Cal
would want you to do.

1038
01:01:21,422 --> 01:01:22,554
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1039
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:28,864
You know what?

1040
01:01:28,908 --> 01:01:31,040
He saved my life
actually one time.

1041
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:31,867
He did?

1042
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:33,477
Yeah.

1043
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:34,348
Yeah.

1044
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:39,353
I was in Dublin and I was
supposed to meet these guys

1045
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,616
who ended up not being who I
thought they were gonna be.

1046
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,793
I figured that out
a little too late.

1047
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:47,404
And I got away, but I got shot.

1048
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,322
So, there I am, I'm on the run.

1049
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:56,196
I literally have no idea what
I'm doing, so I call Cal.

1050
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:58,328
I didn't expect him to
pick up or to do anything

1051
01:01:58,372 --> 01:02:00,722
but I was running out
of options, right?

1052
01:02:00,766 --> 01:02:01,854
But I remember one time
he told me, he said,

1053
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:03,638
"I owe you one."

1054
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:06,815
So that was me hoping
he'd come through.

1055
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:07,773
And he did.

1056
01:02:10,297 --> 01:02:11,603
What happened?

1057
01:02:12,778 --> 01:02:16,825
So, he tracked me
down and I'm literally

1058
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:19,523
on the stone floor of
this old chapel, right?

1059
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:21,613
And I'm looking up at
the barrel of a gun

1060
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:25,051
and I'm thinking to myself,
"All right, this is it."

1061
01:02:25,094 --> 01:02:28,271
And then Cal shows
up and he saves me.

1062
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:31,187
And he said it was by
luck that he was in London

1063
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:32,624
and he was close enough
he could, you know,

1064
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:37,411
get to me before
they [grunts], right?

1065
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:40,849
He didn't have to
show up, but he did.

1066
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:44,418
He patched up and he
told me I was an idiot

1067
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:47,029
and then he got me outta there.

1068
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:49,815
Yeah.

1069
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:51,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1070
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:54,689
My dad had a lot of last
minute trips growing up

1071
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:58,911
and it was never a good
time and I never got a say

1072
01:02:58,954 --> 01:03:00,869
in his staying or going.

1073
01:03:02,784 --> 01:03:03,698
I hated it.

1074
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:06,745
But, uh...

1075
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:11,097
I'm glad he was there.

1076
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,058
So you guys weren't close?

1077
01:03:16,102 --> 01:03:17,190
Not lately.

1078
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:20,672
What changed?

1079
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,893
It just got to be too much.

1080
01:03:24,937 --> 01:03:26,286
[dramatic whooshing]

1081
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:28,592
Look, I got you
into a great program!

1082
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:30,507
Don't act like you're
doing me a favor!

1083
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:32,684
You stuck me in a
subpar community college

1084
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:35,164
that was close to you.

1085
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,383
It's a little tricky
right now, okay?

1086
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:38,341
I don't want you halfway
across the country!

1087
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:41,040
But that's your
life, not mine!

1088
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,259
Do you know how hard
I worked to get into

1089
01:03:43,303 --> 01:03:44,739
the nursing track at school?

1090
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,263
The studying and the midnight
cramming in a cadaver lab

1091
01:03:47,307 --> 01:03:51,093
just so you could screw
it up with your job!

1092
01:03:51,137 --> 01:03:52,834
It's for your own good.

1093
01:03:52,878 --> 01:03:53,879
Sure, Dad.

1094
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,796
Then why not let me
stay at the university

1095
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,928
that has a great
reputation that I worked

1096
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:01,103
very hard to get into?

1097
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:03,540
Because somebody might...

1098
01:04:03,584 --> 01:04:05,499
It's complicated, okay?

1099
01:04:06,674 --> 01:04:09,764
It's just better to keep
a low profile right now.

1100
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,070
Great.

1101
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,636
So, you transferred
me without asking

1102
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,203
and I don't even get
to know the reason why

1103
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:16,902
other than it's for my own good.

1104
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:21,254
[Cal sighs]

1105
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:22,472
Will you go?

1106
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,217
I'll go.

1107
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,133
But I'm done after this.

1108
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:33,222
I'm not coming back.

1109
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:34,963
[Cal grunts]

1110
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:37,487

[dramatic whooshing]

1112
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:42,928
What if they're watching?

1113
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:44,451
What?

1114
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:46,279
Well, you told them you're
looking for it though, right?

1115
01:04:46,322 --> 01:04:48,324
Then they attacked us.

1116
01:04:48,368 --> 01:04:50,544
That's a good point.

1117
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:53,547
But they still
might have your dad.

1118
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:56,463
I just hope it's here.

1119
01:04:56,506 --> 01:04:59,161
This is the only other
place I know where to look.

1120
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:00,815
[Sean] Yeah, well.

1121
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:03,775
Thanks.

1122
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:05,515
I mean it, thank you.

1123
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,169
Oh, yeah, no, no, it's cool.

1124
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:08,736
I'm glad I'm here.

1125
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:14,698
Hey, we'll be careful.

1126
01:05:14,742 --> 01:05:15,874
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

[door thuds]

1129
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:28,843
I'll check in here.

1130
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,237
Yeah, I'll check down here.

1131
01:05:36,024 --> 01:05:38,810

[blankets rustling]

1136
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:12,626
Anything?

1137
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:13,845
Nothing yet.

1138
01:06:16,282 --> 01:06:19,024
[paper rustling]

1139
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,681
My dad brought me back a gift.

1140
01:06:24,725 --> 01:06:25,769
[Sean] Oh yeah?

1141
01:06:25,813 --> 01:06:26,814
What was it?

1142
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:28,772
A knife.

1143
01:06:28,816 --> 01:06:31,601
Your dad got you a knife?

1144
01:06:31,645 --> 01:06:35,083
Yeah, he thought
it was special.

1145
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:36,389
What if it was?

1146
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:39,609
Where is it?

1147
01:06:41,002 --> 01:06:41,916
I don't know, I
mean, it was here

1148
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,613
before they attacked, but...

1149
01:06:43,657 --> 01:06:45,920
Maybe they have it.

1150
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:47,400
No, if they have
it they wouldn't

1151
01:06:47,443 --> 01:06:49,706
come looking for it, right?

1152
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:52,492
I'm gonna look in my room.

1153
01:06:52,535 --> 01:06:55,843
[light dramatic music]

1154
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,545
[Sean] Anything?

1155
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:04,417
Still looking.

[suspenseful music]

1157
01:07:10,597 --> 01:07:13,687
[Sean] Haven't
found anything here.

[dramatic music]

1159
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:35,361

[dramatic music]

1164
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:53,553
[Man] I'm the man
who has your father.

1165
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:55,033
I wanna talk to him.

1166
01:07:55,076 --> 01:07:58,253
[Man] And I bet he's dying
to talk to you, too, Red.

[dramatic music]

1168
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:07,175
No!

1169
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:08,046
Not yet!

1170
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:14,617
Try, uh...

1171
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,970
Try looking in the
drawers in the kitchen.

[light dramatic music]

1173
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,414
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what are you doing?

1174
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:29,589
Don't move.

1175
01:08:31,591 --> 01:08:34,159
Wait, did I miss something?

1176
01:08:34,202 --> 01:08:35,334
You're him.

1177
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,204
Who?

1178
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:38,337
On the phone.

1179
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,947
You have my dad.

1180
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,341
Scarlett, put the gun down.

1181
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,646
Put it down.

1182
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,473
All right, now
think this through.

1183
01:08:44,517 --> 01:08:45,735
Think, think, think.

[Scarlett grunts]

1185
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:54,048
Come on, this is not how
I wanted this to end.

1186
01:08:54,092 --> 01:08:55,571
Where's my dad?

1187
01:08:55,615 --> 01:08:57,356
He's alive.

1188
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,835
Where is the knife?

1189
01:08:58,879 --> 01:08:59,967
Get off me!

1190
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,969
You need to calm down.

1191
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:04,928
Where's the knife?

1192
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:09,542
I trusted you.
[somber music]

1193
01:09:09,585 --> 01:09:10,934
That was the idea.

1194
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:12,023
Why?

1195
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:13,415
Why pretend?

1196
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:16,810
Well, because your
father wouldn't cooperate

1197
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:20,596
and I have buyers, so I needed
you to find the virus for me.

1198
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,815
Is he alive?

1199
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,035

I'll get the answer for you.

he buy me when I was eight?

buy her when she was eight?

He never bought you a dress.

right, that's...

me out, wasn't it?

Lehrman's class today?

No, I wasn't.

1257

Let me ask you something.

1258
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,307
Did you know the whole
time where the virus was

1259
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:18,356
or was it just luck that you
got it before I could steal it?

1260
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,488
That was cold, man.

1261
01:13:20,532 --> 01:13:21,620
Planting it on your daughter,
something so dangerous.

1262
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,490
Wow.

1263
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:27,190
Oh, wait, oh, you didn't know.

1264
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:28,757
[laughs] Oh, you didn't know?

1265
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:32,065
Yeah, the virus was in the
knife you gave your daughter.

1266
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,197
How she figured it
out, she's a smart kid.

1267
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:35,416
Beautiful, too.

1268
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:38,985
Let me ask you something.

1269
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:44,033
When she gets here, would
you rather that I kill her

1270
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,687
or that I keep her?

[light dramatic music]

1298
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:17,159

1300

Where's my dad?

1304
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:50,671
Scarlett.
[light dramatic music]

1305
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:51,542
Dad.

1306
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:54,806
You shouldn't of come here.

1307
01:17:57,504 --> 01:17:58,940
Red.

1308
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:01,421
- Let him go.
- Where is it?

1309
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:02,944
It's in the bag.

1310

[glass clinks]
[dramatic music]

1314
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,400
Good.

1315
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,621
So, have you figured
out who those men

1316
01:18:27,665 --> 01:18:29,536
at the cabin were yet?

1317
01:18:31,277 --> 01:18:34,193
Hey, don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

1318
01:18:34,236 --> 01:18:37,283
[suspenseful music]

1319
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:39,633
'Cause they weren't mine.

1320
01:18:39,677 --> 01:18:41,069
What?

1321
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:42,070
Yeah, no, I figured
maybe they were your dad's

1322
01:18:42,114 --> 01:18:44,072
colleagues or maybe a handler.

1323
01:18:44,116 --> 01:18:46,640
[light dramatic music]

1324
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:49,512
[paper rustling]

1325
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:04,615
Don't listen to him.

1326
01:19:06,181 --> 01:19:07,182
But you...

1327
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,228
I was what?

1328
01:19:10,882 --> 01:19:12,187
Good to you?

1329
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:14,102
I was, right?

1330
01:19:14,146 --> 01:19:16,975
We shared some tender moments.

1331
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,237
I can't help if
you're that gullible.

1332
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,805
Come on, leave her alone.

1333
01:19:20,848 --> 01:19:23,677
You have it now, so I'm
taking my dad and we're leaving.

1334
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:24,983
Oh, oh, oh.
[gun clicking]

1335
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:26,375
No, I know you are
not stupid enough

1336
01:19:26,419 --> 01:19:27,725
to think that's gonna happen.

1337
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,030
Don't.

1338
01:19:29,074 --> 01:19:30,553
Don't what? You
have no leverage.

1339
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,425

1342
01:19:38,736 --> 01:19:40,041
What was that?

1343
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,347
Go, go, go, go!

1344
01:19:42,435 --> 01:19:44,132
[Man] We're on it.

1345
01:19:44,176 --> 01:19:46,308
We need to act now fast.

1346
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:47,570
[Sean] Where'd that come from?

1347
01:19:47,614 --> 01:19:50,095
[Man] I think the north side.

1348
01:19:50,138 --> 01:19:52,184
[grenade beeps]

1349
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:55,578

1353
01:20:09,984 --> 01:20:11,246
That was you?

1354
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:13,640
Cute.

1355
01:20:15,773 --> 01:20:16,730
You could let her go.

1356
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:18,166
Shut up!

1357
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,646
[suspenseful music]

1358
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,952
Tie 'em up in the other room!

01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:26,479
[heavy breathing]

1361
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:37,098
You shouldn't of come here.

1362
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:38,926
And where else was
I supposed to go?

1363
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:43,539
How long was I supposed to
hide while you were missing?

1364
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:46,804
I'm sorry.

1365
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:52,766
You're hurt.

1366
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,289
Oh, don't worry about that.

1367
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:56,030
The virus, we can't let him
walk outta here with it.

1368
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:57,553
I know that.

1369
01:20:57,597 --> 01:20:59,773
Okay, well, whoever he
sells it to is gonna use it.

1370
01:20:59,817 --> 01:21:01,079
It's not the cetus virus.

1371
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:02,428
Okay, well,
whatever it is I can't

1372
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:04,299
- let him walk-
- It's not a virus at all.

1373
01:21:04,343 --> 01:21:05,474
[light dramatic music]
[phone ringing]

1374
01:21:05,518 --> 01:21:06,737
[Girl] Hello?

[liquid trickling]

1376
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:29,324
[light music]

1377
01:21:29,368 --> 01:21:30,325
Nice job.

1378
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:32,023
Oh, he'll figure it out.

1379
01:21:32,066 --> 01:21:34,155
[Cal] Okay, then
we'd better hurry.

1380
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:35,504
Where's the real one?

1381
01:21:35,548 --> 01:21:38,333
Somewhere safe for now.

1382
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:41,815
We probably don't
have much time.

1383
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:44,862
What are you doing?
[both grunting]

1384
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:46,820
I have a razor blade.

1385
01:21:46,864 --> 01:21:48,256
You had one in a
book at the cabin,

1386
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,563
that's what gave me the idea.

1387
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:53,958
[muffled talking]

1388
01:21:54,001 --> 01:21:55,350
They're right outside the door.

[knob rattling]

1391
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,444
It's locked.

1392
01:22:02,488 --> 01:22:04,533
[light dramatic music]

1393
01:22:04,577 --> 01:22:05,926
[Cal] Scarlett.

1394
01:22:07,406 --> 01:22:10,757
[Scarlett grunts]

1395
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,063
Gonna hear you.

1396
01:22:15,457 --> 01:22:16,589
Scarlett.

1397
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:17,851
[Scarlett] We gotta
get out of here.

1398
01:22:17,895 --> 01:22:21,072
Cut me loose, we'll
figure something out.

1399
01:22:21,115 --> 01:22:24,075
[Scarlett panting]

1400
01:22:25,337 --> 01:22:27,818
[light music]

1401
01:22:30,255 --> 01:22:31,082
Come on.

1402
01:22:33,345 --> 01:22:36,348
[footsteps tapping]

1403
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,656
Hurry up, hurry up.

1404
01:22:42,354 --> 01:22:45,226
[phone buzzing]

1405
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,097
Yeah?

1406
01:22:47,098 --> 01:22:48,577
Yes, I have it.

1407
01:22:48,621 --> 01:22:51,015
I'm still waiting for the
first half of the transfer.

1408
01:22:51,058 --> 01:22:54,409
No, I will meet you
when I get confirmation.

1409
01:22:54,453 --> 01:22:57,325
Fine.
[phone beeps]

1410
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:02,765
Those men who
died at the cabin,

1411
01:23:02,809 --> 01:23:04,028
what Sean said about them.

1412
01:23:04,071 --> 01:23:05,899
Don't listen to him.

1413
01:23:08,293 --> 01:23:09,860
But he wasn't lying, was he?

1414
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:11,644
[Cal sighs]

1415
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:12,863
You knew them.

1416
01:23:14,821 --> 01:23:16,344
And I killed them.

1417
01:23:16,388 --> 01:23:20,348
You didn't know what
was really going on.

1418
01:23:20,392 --> 01:23:22,960
[somber music]

1419
01:23:24,483 --> 01:23:28,139
[cries] I'm sorry.

1420
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:30,445
Hey, it's not your fault.

1421
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:32,491
- Who were they?
- Don't.

1422
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:35,450
I'm the one
responsible here, okay?

1423
01:23:35,494 --> 01:23:36,930
Stop trying to
make me feel better.

1424
01:23:36,974 --> 01:23:38,323
Look, I'm not.

1425
01:23:40,673 --> 01:23:44,590
Look, this job, it screwed
up your life enough as it is.

1426
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:46,331
I never should've said that.

1427
01:23:46,374 --> 01:23:48,115
Why not? It's true.

1428
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:55,166
I used to think I
protected us enough and...

1429
01:23:57,777 --> 01:23:59,735
I should've never
put you at risk.

[phone beeping]

1438
01:25:02,885 --> 01:25:04,931
I need an extract.

1439
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:05,932
No, not me.

1440
01:25:06,933 --> 01:25:08,021
My daughter.

[microscope clicking]

1443
01:25:14,723 --> 01:25:15,898
[Sean] What?

1444
01:25:17,596 --> 01:25:20,077
It's not biological.

1445
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,295
What?

1446
01:25:21,339 --> 01:25:22,340
I think...

1447
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:26,692
I think I'm looking
at sugar water.

1448
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:28,389
Get ready, here they come.

1453

1459
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:02,467
Let him go!

1460
01:26:03,903 --> 01:26:05,383
I said let him go.

1461
01:26:08,299 --> 01:26:10,388
[suspenseful music]

1462
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:13,608
[man laughs]

1463
01:26:13,652 --> 01:26:14,479
Move.

1464
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:22,835
Move it, get over there.

1465
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,495
No, no!

1466
01:26:30,538 --> 01:26:31,626
The real vial
is here somewhere.

1467
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,627
Where is it?

1468
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:33,802
You have it.

1469
01:26:33,846 --> 01:26:37,241
You have it, just
let me and my dad go.

1470
01:26:37,284 --> 01:26:38,764
You know, it's funny.

1471
01:26:38,807 --> 01:26:41,245
You keep bargaining for
him and two days ago

1472
01:26:41,288 --> 01:26:42,550
you would have me
pull the trigger

1473
01:26:42,594 --> 01:26:44,422
to get him out of your
life once and for all.

1474
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:45,466
That's not true.

1475
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:46,685
Oh, that's cute.

1476
01:26:46,728 --> 01:26:48,556
You made peace with
him then? Good!

Stop playing games!

1480
01:26:55,563 --> 01:26:57,130
There's no safe
place to stash it,

1481
01:26:57,174 --> 01:27:00,829
so you woulda kept it
close just in case.

1484
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,531
You have five seconds
to tell me where it is,

1485
01:27:06,574 --> 01:27:08,010
Red, or he dies.

1486
01:27:08,054 --> 01:27:09,055
Don't.

1487
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:09,969
One.

1488
01:27:10,012 --> 01:27:11,231
Don't do this.

1489
01:27:11,275 --> 01:27:12,711
Two.

1490
01:27:12,754 --> 01:27:14,147
The moment you tell
him we're both dead.

1491
01:27:14,191 --> 01:27:16,323
- Three.
- Sean, please.

1492
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:18,064
- Four!
- Stop!

1493
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,152
It's outside.

1494
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:21,937
In the car, I...

1495
01:27:21,981 --> 01:27:23,983
I hid it inside the car.

1496
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:27,943
Show me.

1497
01:27:29,075 --> 01:27:30,163
Watch him.

1498
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:34,602
Let's go.
[suspenseful music]

1499
01:27:34,646 --> 01:27:36,169
Where? Where?

1500
01:27:36,213 --> 01:27:37,388
In the back.

1501
01:27:38,389 --> 01:27:39,520
In the trunk.

01:27:50,705 --> 01:27:51,532
Sit.

1505
01:27:59,366 --> 01:28:01,629
Come on, show me. Show me!

1506
01:28:02,804 --> 01:28:04,241
Do you want me to
bring Cal down here

1507
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:06,852
and kill him slowly
in front of you?

1508
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:08,201
Where is it?

1509
01:28:08,245 --> 01:28:12,771
It's with the spare tire.
[suspenseful music]

1510
01:28:13,946 --> 01:28:15,556
Okay, get out,
get out of the way.

1511

01:38:09,019 --> 01:38:11,282
[light dramatic music]
[sirens wailing]

1635
01:38:11,325 --> 01:38:12,152
You got hit.

1636
01:38:12,196 --> 01:38:13,458
Yeah, it's...

1637
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,201
[light music]

1638
01:38:23,555 --> 01:38:26,384
[muffled talking]

1639
01:38:31,389 --> 01:38:32,869
Hey.

1640
01:38:32,912 --> 01:38:33,870
Hi.

1641
01:38:33,913 --> 01:38:36,350
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Yeah.

1642
01:38:36,394 --> 01:38:37,917
This looks good.

1643
01:38:37,961 --> 01:38:39,658
Yeah, it kinda does.

1644
01:38:39,701 --> 01:38:41,181
How's your leg?

1645
01:38:41,225 --> 01:38:42,226
It's fine.

1646
01:38:43,357 --> 01:38:44,706
Stitches itch.

1647
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,969
Don't scratch it, okay?

1648
01:38:46,012 --> 01:38:47,100
It's gonna make it worse.

1649
01:38:47,144 --> 01:38:49,276
Just keep it covered.

1650
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,148
Yes, Nurse Scarlett.

1651
01:38:54,934 --> 01:38:56,718
Well, the realtor called.

1652
01:38:56,762 --> 01:38:59,634
She's got some decent
options this time.

1653
01:38:59,678 --> 01:39:01,941
Remote enough for
Grandma's new house?

1654
01:39:01,985 --> 01:39:05,510
Off the beaten path, yet
close enough to the city.

1655
01:39:05,553 --> 01:39:08,556
You know, we could
keep the old one.

1656
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:09,601
Too risky.

1657
01:39:12,909 --> 01:39:16,695
Maybe you wanna come take a
look at some of the new ones?

1658
01:39:16,738 --> 01:39:18,479
I have an exam.

1659
01:39:18,523 --> 01:39:20,003
Yeah, of course.

1660
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,616
Could we go this
weekend instead?

1661
01:39:27,445 --> 01:39:29,360
Yeah, I'll set it up.

1662
01:39:34,104 --> 01:39:37,759
Maybe you wanna hit the
shooting range, too?

1663
01:39:37,803 --> 01:39:39,109
Don't push it.

1664
01:39:40,545 --> 01:39:45,419
[Cal chuckles]
[light dramatic music]

1665
01:39:45,463 --> 01:39:48,814
[dramatic upbeat music]
