00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,322
Well, 15 years.

169
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:27,758
You're a legend.

170
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,326
<i>You're in Parade Magazine.</i>

171
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,095
You're the Elvis of butter.

172
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:36,332
But we just kinda feel
like it's time...

173
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,240
...you gave
somebody else a shot.

174
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,941
Uh-huh.

175
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:47,210
We're prepared to offer
you a spot at State.

176
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,913
Um... you could be a judge.

177
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:54,019
With me and Mary Alice
and Carl Hudgens.

178
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,390
- Carl Hudgens is a good guy.
- He's a great guy.

179
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,960
It's time to start giving back.

180
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,428
You know, like Oprah does.

181
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:08,231
Yeah, well, she's got
that Angel Network.

182
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:12,103
I just have one
sort of delicate question.

183
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,272
- Laura?
- Laura.

184
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,942
[Laura laughing] You know,
I really think that Bob

185
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,909
could be an excellent mayor.

186
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,845
or even, or even governor.

187
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,383
[Orval] 'Cause I know she's...

188
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,885
...she's very, uh... involved.

189
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,988
Oh, she's fine.
She'll be fine.

190
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,024
Laura... [clearing throat]

191
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:36,159
[crashing, glass shattering]

192
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,162
These fuckers have no idea
who they're dealing with.

193
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,331
We're the motherfucking
Picklers.

194
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,901
Clearly Orval wanted you
out of the way.

195
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,304
I have always known
what kind of man he was.

196
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,038
I never thought
he'd go this far.

197
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,407
You know Orval is a good man.

198
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,317
He has had it out for us
from day one, Bob.

199
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,917
I will call the governor.

200
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,086
That's what I'll do.
I'll call the governor.

201
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:06,090
Or Jesus. I mean, don't you
have his direct line?

202
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:09,560
My constitutional rights are being
violated and I will call the governor.

203
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,928
The governor
doesn't care, Laura.

204
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,433
[dialing telephone]

205
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,236
What did you say?

206
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:22,282
The governor doesn't care.

207
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,215
Whose side are you on, Bob?

208
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:36,255
It's time to pass
the baton, Laura.

209
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,325
I need to start giving back.

210
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,591
Like Oprah.

211
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:44,869
How dare you
bring Oprah into this?

212
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,970
Kaitlen, sweetie.

213
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,473
Could you please provide your
father and me with some privacy?

214
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,576
She can stay.

215
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,485
Cover your balls, Dad.

216
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,255
I see what happened here, Bob.

217
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,957
You didn't stand up
for yourself, did you?

218
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,226
That's what happened here.

219
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:19,229
I think it'd show a real touch
of class if we stepped down now.

220
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,332
I guess Dad was right when he
warned me against marrying someone

221
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,302
whose biggest dream was to be
the middle school principal.

222
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,404
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It just means maybe I should've taken his advice

223
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,907
- and married Boyd Bolton.
- Boyd Bolton?

224
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:34,577
At least he inherited a
successful car dealership.

225
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,316
I am done.

226
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:41,985
I doubt Boyd would just give up Bolton
Supercenter at the drop of a hat, Bob.

227
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,586
Laura, please.

228
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:46,257
You get back here, Bob.

229
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,328
If you won't stand up to them,
then I will!

230
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:53,234
[car starts]

231
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,667

<i>I gotta ask you, you just turned
down over a half a million dollars.</i>

234
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:33,303
I told her not to pick 22.

235
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,272

[car horn honking]

238
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,383
- [car door closes]
- Oh, shit! Tell her I'm not here.

239
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,485
What? Who? What's going on?

240
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,956
- Laura. Laura Pickler.
- Oh, God. Here?

241
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,558
- Tell her I'm fishing.
- At night?

242
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,393
Oh, God! Why is she here?

243
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,162
- [Laura pounds on door] Orval!
- What if she gets inside?

244
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:02,499
- Orval!
- Can you hear me?

245
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,671
I hear you!

246
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:09,373
<i>- [man on TV] One is worth $200,000.
- [woman] Yeah.</i>

How nice to see you.

251
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,253
Where's Orval?

252
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,061
He's in the shower.

253
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:33,138
Maybe I can have him
call you later.

254
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,755
I'll wait.

255
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:01,399
If you ask me,
number 24 is too thin.

256
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,566
- [door opens, closes]
- Oh, I see how it is.

257
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,469
- He wants to play a game, does he?
- [car departs quickly]

258
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,271
Well, you tell
Orval this isn't over.

Your father cares
about you, right?

288
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,405
My father raped me.

Someone who understands me,
someone to love me.

Not just someone to pay my rent

293
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:11,555
which, by the way, comes out
to $560 a month plus utilities.

294

Oh! Sweet Jesus!

You're not innocent

You're sleeping
on the couch tonight.

322
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,779
I sleep on
the couch every night.

323
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:47,617
If I were you...
I'd get a good night's sleep.

324
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:50,453
Because County is in a month
and we got a lot of work to do.

325
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:52,956
Laura, it's over. I'm not entering County.
Orval and I agreed.

326
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,592
We gotta get the butter,
we gotta sharpen the trowels.

327
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:58,962
We gotta check the cooling unit because the
temperature thing's been all fucked up for ages.

328
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:02,598
- We gotta...
- Listen to me. I'm not competing this year.

329
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,401
I know.

330
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,903
- I am.
- What?

331
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,805
I'm competing.

332
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,507
I'll win County.

333
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:14,443
And after that I will bring back
what is rightfully ours.

334
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,347
And you're gonna help me.

335
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:19,850
Good night.

336
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,853
There's Advil in the kitchen
for your penis.

337
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,756
So I checked your schedule.
You got Mr. Evans for History.

338
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,593
He's very, very old,
so be patient.

339
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:33,596

of the historical events that he covers.

a tree should look like.

Here.
You can use mine.

350
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:10,407
- I have two.
- Thanks.

352

Yeah.

Well, I wanted you to know

354
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:26,549

Believe me, she means well.
You know, she used to be worse.

367
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,045
She used to buy this
fake meat called seitan.

- Exactly like the devil.

00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:13,656
Well, Kaitlen, your father
and I have some great news.

381
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:17,928
As you know the Mastery in Butter
Committee has turned on your father

382
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,564
like Judas Iscariot himself.

383
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,866
The good news is that,
instead of your father

384
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:27,970
- I will be competing this year.
- [scoffs]

385
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,774
- I think we should be proud of your mother.
- Stepmother.

386
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,010
And have you ever made a butter
sculpture before?

387
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,212
You don't even eat dairy.

388
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:39,516
Oh, man, you are
gonna suck so hard.

389
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:43,553
- Kaitlen.
- I guess I expected outsiders to be skeptical,

390
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:44,857
but my own family?

391
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:50,192
I have stood by your father
for the past 15 years.

Watching, learning, absorbing.

393
00:23:52,963 --> 00:24:00,269
I was there when he turned 867 sticks
of butter into First Lady Laura Bush.

394
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,739
I was there when,
two days before State,

395
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,579
the cooler broke and his Iwo Jima
just turned into a river of yellow.

00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,283

This isn't happening.

406
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,120
But you said you loved me, Bob.

407
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,954
That was a little early for me.

408
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:55,592
But we did it. I never do it
with guys from the club, Bob.

- [Kaitlen] Is she a hooker?
- [Bob] No, no.

- Those are Army boots.

- Because I totally understand if she is.
- Kaitlen.

There could be
the ghost of Hitler.

502
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,011
What if there's no gravity in there?
And you float up

503
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:17,278
and bang your head on the ceiling.
And then all of a sudden,

504
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,616
gravity kicks in and then you
bang your head on the floor?

505
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,185
- There could be a black hole and it'd suck me all up.
- Yes.

506
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:25,022
What if this place is full of
good-looking British vampires?

507
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:29,258
- The worst of all of them.
- They're so pale.

508
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,995
- Or hungry cannibals.
- It could happen.

509
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,633
Or there could be a mass murderer who

Or racist ninjas, yes.
High five.

That was a good one.

So think about all that

514
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:48,511
and ask yourself, really,

515
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:51,514
what's the worst thing
that could happen?

516
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,217
I could be terrible and lose.

517
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,451
Yeah.

518
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:57,120
Yeah, could you live with that?

I guess so.

such a big deal, is it?

"Carol Ann, you've been sitting
in the audience for too long.

535

in here about that. I really...

Interesting. Did he buy
600 blowjobs on credit?

I get pregnant

He'll get bored.

00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,982
Move from a log house
to the White House

687
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:44,720
and risk both houses to keep
this great nation together?

688
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:50,759
The same reason a poor black
woman risked life and limb,

689
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,428
partnering with white
and black people alike

690
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:57,101
to bring my ancestors to freedom
on the Underground Railroad.

691
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,438
Why?

692
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:06,040
Because she dared to dream.

693
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,343

I'm doing here today.

How'd you do that?

697
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,091
[chuckles] Wow.

698
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:24,926

not least, Laura Pickler!

702
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,211
Family.

703
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,379
When... when I think
about butter

704
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,784
I think about family.

705

[clears throat] Why?

706
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:57,125
Because like the thread
of a grandmother's quilt,

707
00:44:57,126 --> 00:45:00,863
butter is the centerpiece
of a family dinner.

708
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,997
And family, in turn,

709
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:06,868
is the thread that holds our
great country together.

710
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,303
Without butter,
there is no family,

711
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:12,085

there is no...

It is about
"excellence in butter."

working hard,

721
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:03,894

this competition was about.

Actually, it's $1200.

858
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:48,649
OK. You are so beautiful.

859
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,955
You're everything that
I've ever wanted to be.

860
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:56,594
And now you're
right here in my arms.

861
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:02,763
<i>- OK.
- # Gonna spread you like butter #</i>

862
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:05,500
<i># Baby on my bread #</i>

863
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,801
<i># Don't want no other #</i>

864
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:10,138
<i># Girl in my bed #</i>

865
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:12,973
<i># Gonna spread you
like butter #</i>

866
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:15,542
<i># Baby on my bread #</i>

867
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,745
<i># I don't want no other #</i>

868
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:21,549
<i># Girl in my bed
Gonna spread you like... #</i>

869
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:25,486
[Boyd] Are you there, God?
It's me, Boyd Bolton.

870
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,823
Oh, wait, there's probably
a lot of Boyd Boltons.

871
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:31,959
Hmm.

872
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,730
OK, so just so you know, I'm
the one that lives in Iowa City.

873
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,134
[sighs]

874
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,437
I don't think there's any other Boyd
Boltons that live in Iowa City,

875
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:46,777
but if there is, I'm the one
who runs Bolton Supercenter.

876
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:50,944
Yeah, anyway...

877
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:54,082
...I just wanted to take this
moment to thank you

878
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:57,051
for sending Laura Pickler
to fuck me.

879
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:59,721
I mean, I don't know what you
guys are doing up there,

880
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:02,025
but her pussy is like even tighter
than it was in high school.

881
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:09,467
It's... it's like she hasn't
even used it in 20 years.

882
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:13,170
Anyway...

883
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,007
...I just wanted to say...

884
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:20,210
...thank you.

885
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,615
You're so cool, God.

886
00:56:27,615 --> 00:56:28,716
Amen.

887
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:30,192
[telephone ringing]

888
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,959
Hello?

889
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,032
Oh, hi, Nancy.

890
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,866
What?!

891
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:49,706
Well, what could possibly be the
problem? She's ten years old.

892
00:56:51,706 --> 00:56:53,508
Right, all right.

893
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:55,617
See you then. Good-bye.

894
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:03,750
I'm scared.

895
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:07,087
Why are you scared?
You're amazing.

896
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:09,656
Really, it's them that
should be scared.

897
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:12,794
No, I'm scared that you and
Miss Jill won't want me anymore.

898
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,764
What?!

899
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:17,064
It's happened before.

900
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,608
They just leave me.

901
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:28,012
[exhales]

902
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:32,947
Did you know that
Jill can't have kids?

903
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:34,982
Why?

904
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:38,953
Well, I mean,
that's complicated.

905
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:40,154
It's...

906
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,991
- Is her vagina broken?
- Yes.

907
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:46,160
Yep. That's it.

908
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:52,267
The adoption people would ask
us over and over again...

909
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,903
"Are you sure you
don't want a baby?

910
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,005
We can get you a baby.

911
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,674
You both have good jobs.

912
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:02,576
You have a nice house.

913
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:05,784
We can get you a baby."

914
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:13,654
But we made up this whole thing
in our heads that, like,

915
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:18,292
we wanted an older child because
they're always overlooked

916
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:24,204
and we'd be doing so much good for
society and the world and everything.

917
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:33,643
But the truth is,
we were afraid to have a baby.

918
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:36,081
Why?

919
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:41,186
I don't know.

920
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:47,788
- It's OK to be scared, I guess.
- [door opens]

921
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:50,898
[woman] Hey, you guys,
they're ready for us now.

922
00:58:56,898 --> 00:58:59,701
Destiny, um, come in.

923
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,935
What's going on?

924
00:59:01,936 --> 00:59:05,839
This is Martin Caswell
from Red Ribbon.

925
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,809
- [door closes]
- [intercom beeps]

926
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,385
[Martin] Julie,
send in Mr. Bolton.

927
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,754
[whistles]

928
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:22,199
Oh. [Chuckling]

929
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,236
Boyd, would you tell these people,
please, what you told me? Exactly?

930
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,105
[stammers] Oh, yeah.

931
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:43,076
On the evening of the 15th,
Mr. Ethan approached me,

932
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:46,279
knowing I have superior skills
in the art of sculpting butter.

933
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,852
And asked if I would help
his daughter, Destiny,

934
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,063
with her sculpture...

935
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:07,035
...with her entry for the Johnson
County Mastery in Butter contest.

936
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,106
I'm sorry, what?

937
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:12,007
I said no at first.

938
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:18,712
- But after he gave me $500...
- You're kidding!

939
01:00:18,713 --> 01:00:21,214
...I snuck in when
no one was looking

940
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:25,919
and I... I carved
her sculpture for her.

941
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,823
I can no longer live
with this horrible blight...

942
01:00:29,824 --> 01:00:32,929
...on, on, on, on, on...

943
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:37,001
...on my conscience.

944
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,803
This is crazy, OK?

945
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,839
I have never met this dude
in my life, I swear to God.

946
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,743
Come on, you people saw her
carve it with your own eyes.

947
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:50,944
I can't even believe
I'm arguing this.

948
01:00:50,945 --> 01:00:52,379
May I make a suggestion?

949
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,417
As it's clear that Destiny's win
is in question, I...

950
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,720
Absolutely not.

951
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,122
Destiny won this on her own,
fair and square.

952
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:04,058
I think the only fair solution
would be to have a rematch.

953
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:06,426
Me versus Destiny.

954
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:07,895
At the State Fair.

955
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:10,297
Um, State is this weekend.

956
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:14,368
I mean, I can't possibly get the
proper paperwork prepared in time.

957
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:17,471
I'm sure someone as smart as you
can figure it out, Nancy.

958
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:19,339
But the coolers.

959
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,176
And then we'd have to haul all
the butter in two days before

960
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:25,046
- so it'll set and...
- Excellent. Great.

961
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:28,982
Well, now that Nancy has
agreed to do her... her job

962
01:01:28,983 --> 01:01:30,917
looks like we've got a rematch.

963
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:33,087
What's wrong with you people?

964
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:36,823
I can't believe you just let this
two-bit trophy wife come in here...

965
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:39,893
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now wait a second.

966
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:42,196
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [overlapping chatter]

967
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:43,530
- I know.
- She's crazy.

968
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:45,099
This is the kind
of thing that I just...

969
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,035
- Who are you?
- I'll do it.

970
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:49,403
...from over here.

971
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:53,174
- I'll do it.
- Destiny.

972
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:56,477
Eight-hour carve time,
all out in the open,

973
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:58,846
officials present every minute.

974
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,281
No verbal contact
with the audience.

975
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,954
No help.

976
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:07,023
And no speeches.

977
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:09,390
Just butter.

978
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:11,529
- Deal?
- Deal.

979
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,363
Can you believe that bitch?

980
01:02:16,364 --> 01:02:17,864
Jill.

981
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:20,868
Sorry. You know you
can't say "bitch" right?

982
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:23,171
- I know.
- Just her whole thing.

983
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,239
The hair, the dress, that grin.

984
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,110
Destiny, it's not too late to go back in there
and tell them you don't wanna do this thing.

985
01:02:29,111 --> 01:02:34,247
Are you kidding me? Destiny is gonna
nail that witch. Aren't you, Destiny?

986
01:02:34,248 --> 01:02:36,082
You better believe it.

987
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,951
All right.

988
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:39,155
Let's prep.

989
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:41,922
Laura.

990
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:45,426
Laura!

991
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:48,361
Obviously, I wish you had better
reading skills, but all in all...

992
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:50,599
She's only ten!

993
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,500
Thank you for your help, Boyd.

994
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:55,937
[scoffs] What, that's it?

995
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,839
That's it?

996
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,374
Hey, hey, where are you going?

997
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:03,410
Come on, don't you remember us?
We were Boyd and Laura.

998
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:07,281
- [sighs] I give up.
- Boyd.

999
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:09,018
[marching band playing]

1000
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:11,352
[Kaitlen] Hey.

1001
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:13,855
Imagine if we got
an apartment together.

1002
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,156
We could move to Des Moines.

1003
01:03:16,157 --> 01:03:19,326
You got the $1200 right?

1004
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:21,596
Or maybe Chicago.

1005
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:25,131
Can you imagine how humiliated
my stepmom would be?

1006
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:27,334
She'd probably like, explode.

1007
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:29,139
I think you're late
for practice.

1008
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,406
I could be with you forever.

1009
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:34,975
Yeah.

1010
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:38,879
- About that. The money?
- Oh.

1011
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,915
I can't wait to see
how this plays out.

1012
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,517
Good luck.

1013
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:45,953
Call me.

1014
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:47,622
Yeah, definitely will.

1015
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,400
I was only kidding about
the moving in together stuff.

1016
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,301
Move it, bitches!

1017
01:04:01,302 --> 01:04:02,139
[band halts abruptly]

1018
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:06,274
- [Brooke] Whoo!
- [school bell rings]

1019
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,315
[children chattering]

1020
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:16,417
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

1021
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:20,187
Let's go for a ride.
I got something to show you.

1022
01:04:20,188 --> 01:04:22,622
OK.

1023
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:24,125
What'd you learn
in school today?

1024
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,259
Positive and negative numbers.

1025
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,398
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1026
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,065
[Brooke] See that store
over there?

1027
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,633
Mm-hm.

1028
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:35,069
With this $1200
I could buy work clothes

1029
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,041
like you have never seen.

01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,045
Where do you work?

1031
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,485
Barnes & Noble.

1032
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:53,154
So I want you
to look over there.

1033
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:59,125
And I want you to see very clearly
that I am willing to sacrifice $1200

1034
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:03,196
worth of totally cute outfits so
that you can have these knives.

1035
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:05,759
And with these knives,
you carve the best damn

1036
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,102
butter sculpture this
world has ever seen.

1037
01:05:08,103 --> 01:05:10,136
You must not fail, Destiny.

1038
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:14,274
You can do this.
You can take down Laura Pickler.

1039
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:17,012
You kick her pasty,
white ass so hard,

1040
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:21,181
so that she and her stupid
husband can never wreak havoc

1041
01:05:21,182 --> 01:05:24,118
on poor, innocent people
like me ever again.

1042

nine times out of ten in these cases,

1046
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:52,346

1047
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:53,647
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

1048
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,582
[woman] Hi, Destiny.

1049
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,718
You know...

1050
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,422
..I think it would be best if we had
this discussion alone, just grownups.

1051
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:04,396
Uh... No, no, she can stay.

1052
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,199
OK.

1053
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:16,407
- From what we can surmise, on the night of...
- Um...

1054
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,576
Destiny, your mother
was a wonderful woman

1055
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:25,815
who fell on hard times.

1056
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:30,683
She was not capable
of taking care of you,

1057
01:06:30,684 --> 01:06:34,500
but she loved you
very much nonetheless.

1058
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,472
We found this.

1059
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:53,710
She's pretty.

1060
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,645
Hi, Mom. It's me,
Destiny. Your daughter.

1061
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:01,714
We probably haven't seen each
other since I was a baby.

1062
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:03,716
I don't remember you at all.

1063
01:07:03,717 --> 01:07:07,555
But now that the lady gave me
your picture, I wish I did.

1064
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:11,125
I don't know what you were
doing all these years,

1065
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,760
but now that
you've gone to heaven

1066
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:15,830
I just want you to know
I forgive you for leaving me.

1067
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:21,134
I don't really understand it that
much, but I still forgive you.

1068
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,313
OK. Bye.

Hey.

1075
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:14,921
Um... I don't think
this is gonna work.

1076
01:08:14,922 --> 01:08:19,460
Laura, you're gonna need an
armature for something that grand.

1077
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:22,763
Then I'll build an armature.

1078
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:25,502
I'm not afraid
of hard work, Bob.

1079
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,737
Not that it matters
anymore anyway.

What do you mean?

1081
01:08:31,405 --> 01:08:34,175
Well, you saw
what I did back there.

1082
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:41,314
My sculpture was twice as good as your
"Schindler's List" and you know it.

1083
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:44,751
My cooler was 43 degrees, the
eye-forehead-ratio was perfect.

1084
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:47,621
Yeah. You had all that down.

1085
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:50,559
I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kinda
surprised at how technically good you are.

1086
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,695
- You think, Bob?
- Yeah.

1087
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:57,632
But you also need
to inject some soul into it.

1088
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:00,768
I'm just saying...

1089
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:02,472
...not everyone can be
an artist.

1090
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:07,212
You don't think
I can be an artist?

1091
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:13,613
Look, I know what it is
I'm dealing with here.

1092
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:15,782
I am gonna have to give
these so-called judges

1093
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:21,388
the statement piece
that they're looking for.

1094
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:25,593
And when they see what I have planned for
them, their jaws are gonna hit the floor.

1095
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,328
And you are gonna
be right there,

1198
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:34,174
The judges have reached
a decision. Orval?

1199
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,242
Thank you, Nancy. Um...

1200
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:39,446
In my years judging
this competition, uh,

1201
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:41,046
I've seen many things.

1202
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:45,050
But only twice
have I seen true art.

1203
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:50,857
The first was Bob Pickler's
brilliant "Passion of The Christ"

1204
01:18:50,858 --> 01:18:54,528
with Neil Diamond as Jesus.

1205
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:58,465
- And the second this morning...
- Did he say Neil Diamond?

1206
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:03,804
...when I laid eyes on a work
so tragic, so touching,

1207
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:09,408
that it became not just butter
carving, but butter art.

1208
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:15,247
And to be touched yourself, you
merely have to look right here...

1209
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:17,917
...at the sad, melted face

1210
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:20,420
of this unloved child.

1211
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:23,908
Our winner, again, is Destiny.

1212
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:43,953
Can you put me down, please?

1213
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,385
I'd just like to say

1214
01:19:53,386 --> 01:19:56,360
this isn't all you have.
