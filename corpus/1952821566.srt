1
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,046
Tensions between the US and North Korea
have reached an all-time high.

2
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,314
Newly released intelligence suggests
that Russian or Chinese interests...

3
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,951
may have sold sophisticated
defense technology to the rogue state.

4
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,292
North Korea continues to deny
all allegations...

5
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,825
and have staged mass rallies of support...

6
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,925
for its fight
against so-called foreign imperialism.

7
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,236
This, as the UN Security Council
meets today...

8
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,241
for an emergency session
to decide on a resolution...

9
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,073
calling for a naval blockade of North Korea.

10
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,494
Back to our top story
on the crisis in North Korea.

11
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,500
The U.S. Pacific Command has increased
its presence in the Sea of Japan...

12
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,629
with a carrier task force
and heightened security at the DMZ.

13
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,839
The Pentagon says that
satellites have detected evidence...

14
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,242
of two ballistic missile bases
under construction in the North...

15
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:31,113
capable of reaching targets
in Guam, Okinawa, Alaska, and even Hawaii.

16
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,241
Cmdr. Habley.

17
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,478
Yes, sir, I'm watching.

18
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,450
...but the President has reaffirmed
the United States will not....

19
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,721
It's our job to make them think twice.

20
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,318
This latest escalation in rhetoric...

21
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,385
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,728
...has left the tides of diplomacy
in its wake...

23
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,064
and has brought us even closer
to the tides of war.

24
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,623
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
I didn't realize you were working out.

25
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,327
It's all right. I'm pretty done.

26
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,035
Whose idea was it to have pizza night
every Saturday?

27
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,734
It was your idea, sir.

28
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:04,969
Yes, I know.

29
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,979
This your first tour?

30
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,378
Petty Officer Murray.

31
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,779
Second tour, sir.

32
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,613
Food is great on this boat.

33
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,916
I promised my wife this time I'd come back
without the extra pounds.

34
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,183
I'll get you home, son.

35
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,054
The rest is up to you.

36
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,890
-Carry on.
-Thank you, sir.

37
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:40,740
You're relieved.

38
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,178
Chief of the Boat?

39
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,246
How did you pull Diving Officer duty again?

40
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,185
Let's just say I like to be
where the action is, sir.

41
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,586
Action? Well, when we get back to Pearl...

42
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:53,216
the Captain and I are going to have to
take you to Luana Hills.

43
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,989
It's the most beautiful course around.
I sank a hole-in-one last time I was there...

44
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,962
and beat Vice Admiral Sommerville.

45
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,396
Was that a smart move, sir?

46
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,592
His short game needs work.

47
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:03,896
Did you tell him that?

48
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:06,233
No. I want to keep my job.

49
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,938
Conn, Radio.
We have an incoming download...

50
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,102
via satellite link
from National Military Command Center.

51
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,074
Request to raise UHF antenna.

52
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,576
Radio, Conn. Prepare for download.

53
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,444
Chief of the Watch, raise the UHF antenna.

54
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,888
Diving Officer, slow us to 12 knots,
and bring us up to 60 feet.

55
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,152
Church-mouse quiet.

56
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,957
Aye, sir.
1 2 knots, 60 feet, church-mouse quiet.

57
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,288
Navigation Officer has the Conn.

58
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,741
Enter.

59
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,919
How do you do that?
I never get a chance to knock.

60
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,516
I was looking forward to some quality time
on the links.

61
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,818
I guess we're not going back to Pearl.

62
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,721
Doesn't look good, Tom.

63
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,132
These are holding launch orders.

64
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,169
We sit, wait for confirmation,
and if it comes...

65
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:18,976
we shoot and scoot.

66
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,309
Target baggage?

67
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,213
Missile base is at Yangdok,
50 miles east of Pyongyang.

68
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:28,385
The other base is at Honchon.

69
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,516
Full-deployment attack.

70
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,357
Your dad was here, right,
during the Korean War?

71
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,689
Yeah, he was an ensign on a destroyer.

72
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,619
Saw action at lnchon.

73
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,529
Fifty years
and we still got trouble over here.

74
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,362
You think we're going to war, Frank?

75
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,925
-I'll be up in a couple of minutes.
-Right.

76
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,534
Murray.

77
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,304
Okay.

78
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,182
-Afternoon, Captain.
-Afternoon.

79
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,855
-I have the Conn.
-Captain has the Conn.

80
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,587
Diving Officer, what's our depth?

81
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,658
Depth 60 feet, sir.

82
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,026
Speed, five knots.

83
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,464
Satellite mast is up, periscope's ready, sir.

84
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,130
WEPS, are the VLS tubes ready?

85
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,763
All 12 Tomahawks ready to be delivered, sir.

86
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,966
Gentlemen, we're awaiting confirmation
of our orders.

87
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,538
We could be here five minutes or five days.

88
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,474
Sonar, Conn. Any broadband contacts?

89
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,073
Anything?

90
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,409
Conn...

91
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,147
Sonar. No contact.

92
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,733
What is it, Captain? Did you see something?

93
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,726
No. That's the problem.

94
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,332
We are 10 miles within the North Korean
military zone and not one ship.

95
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,210
Conn, Radio.

96
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,256
We're picking up increased chatter
from the submarine base at Wonsan.

97
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,786
Radio, Conn.
Continue to log all transmissions.

98
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,508
Sonar, Conn. Any broadband contacts?

99
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,207
Conn, Sonar. Nothing, sir. No contacts.

100
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,476
Battaglia, are you absolutely sure?

101
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,818
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,184
Where the hell did she come from?

103
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,350
Sir?

104
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,690
It's not a Russian Akula or a Kilo.

105
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,924
She's not a Chinese Han Class, either.

106
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,626
-Korean Shark Class?
-No, too large.

107
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,298
Whoever she is,
there's no acoustic fingerprint.

108
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,872
-Emergency deep.
-Emergency deep.

109
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,705
Gentlemen, we have a submarine
at 4,000 yards.

110
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,712
Dive, dive, dive.

111
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:20,889
Diving Officer, take her down to 500 feet.

112
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:24,419
-We'll hide out in the Chousan Trench.
-Chousan Trench?

113
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,520
Aye, sir.

114
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:27,326
Diving to 500 feet.

115
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,504
Man battle stations.

116
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,039
Man battle stations.

117
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,440
Repeat, man battle stations.
This is not a drill.

118
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,584
Right where we started.

119
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,303
Conn, Sonar. Torpedo in the water.

120
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,468
Just came out of nowhere.

121
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,239
-Bearing?
-050.

122
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,804
Range 3,500 yards and closing fast.

123
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,476
Sonar, Conn.
Lock in torpedo's sonar signature.

124
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,218
COB, get us in that trench.

125
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,015
300 feet, Captain.

126
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:31,993
WEPS, give me fish in Tubes 2 and 4
and stand ready.

127
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,232
Torpedo bearing steady at 050.

128
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,867
Range 2,500 yards and closing.

129
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,135
Depth, 400 feet.

130
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,148
We'll lose them in the trench.

131
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,852
It's our best chance.

132
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,220
Conn, Sonar.

133
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,130
Estimated impact in 60 seconds.

134
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,225
Depth, 450 feet.

135
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,397
All ahead full. Give me 25 knots.

136
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:27,181
Diving Officer, right full rudder.
Come to course 180.

137
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:31,348
Aye, sir. Right full rudder. Course 180.

138
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,745
Launch countermeasures.

139
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,787
Chief of the Watch, sound collision alarm.

140
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,726
Rig ship for impact.

141
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,354
All stations, damage report to control.

142
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,397
Conn, Engine Room. We've got
a little flooding in the rear bilge tank.

143
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,126
Conn, Reactor. We're okay.

144
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,191
Conn, Torpedo Room. We're still here.

145
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,602
Conn, Radio. Reporting to Com Sub Pac
in Pearl by floating wire.

146
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,909
WEPS, do we have a firing solution?

147
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:01,377
Yes, sir. It'll be like shooting blind,
but I think we can score a hit.

148
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,471
We have a firing solution.

149
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:04,810
Fire Tubes 2 and 4.

150
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,852
Murray, how long
before international waters?

151
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,447
At our speed...

152
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,689
9,000 yards, about 10 minutes, sir.

153
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,656
Murray, are you a religious man?

154
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,691
I am now, sir.

155
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,864
Good. Say a prayer,
and plot us a course out of here.

156
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:25,925
Aye, aye.

157
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,772
Conn, Sonar.

158
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,071
Torpedoes 1,000 yards and closing.

159
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,667
Impact in 30 seconds.

160
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,783
XO, take the Conn.

161
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,227
Torpedoes exploded?

162
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,263
No, it's their countermeasures.

163
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:56,726
Sir, these torpedoes are being dropped
from an ASW plane, aren't they?

164
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,930
No, we've got a new class of submarine
out there, Battaglia.

165
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,472
Right now, she's calling the shots.

166
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,405
-A submarine, sir?
-That's right.

167
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,272
You find me that sub.

168
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,636
Working on it, Captain.

169
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,237
International waters, five minutes.

170
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,206
I have the Conn.

171
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,082
Captain has the Conn.

172
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:27,598
Torpedoes in the water, bearing 205.

173
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,758
Range 1,500 yards and closing.

174
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,437
Chief of the Watch, sound collision alarm.

175
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,067
Talk to me, Murray.

176
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,440
2,000 yards until international waters, sir.

177
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,876
Just under two minutes.

178
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,676
-Launch countermeasures.
-Countermeasures being deployed, sir.

179
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:50,886
Diving Officer, right full rudder.
Come to course 180.

180
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,649
Conn, Sonar.

181
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,421
Torpedoes 500 yards.

182
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,860
Impact in 20 seconds.

183
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,066
It's gonna be close.

184
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,830
Is everyone okay?

185
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,632
-Switch.
-Yes.

186
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,733
All stations damage report to control.

187
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,843
Conn, Engine Room. This is Savage.

188
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,744
The turbine generator is on fire.

189
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,943
And we've got broken pipes
spraying hydraulic fluids everywhere.

190
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,419
Engineering Officer Makwana
is badly injured.

191
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,853
We need to put this fire out now!

192
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,447
This is the XO.
Fire team to the Engine Room.

193
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,086
Be careful, Tom.

194
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,219
We will.

195
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,396
Conn, Torpedo Room, no damage.

196
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,260
Conn, Reactor, no damage.

197
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,798
If they attack us in international waters,
it'll be a war.

198
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,130
Yeah.

199
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,778
Conn, Engine Room.

200
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,476
We're at 50% turbine power...

201
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,575
and sliding.

202
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,483
We gotta get this fire out now!

203
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,454
COB, bring her up to 300 feet.

204
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,854
300 feet, sir.

205
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,989
Okay, everybody, suit up.

206
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,430
Savage, you're the nozzle man!

207
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,101
I'm going ahead.

208
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,235
What's our depth?

209
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,767
250 feet, sir.

210
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,274
Gotta get these hatches open
to vent the toxic air.

211
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,480
Approaching international waters
in 30 seconds, sir.

212
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,037
Engine Room, damage report.

213
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,038
Engine Room, damage report.

214
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,202
Rerouting. Rerouting.

215
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,473
Better.

216
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,209
Engine Room, can you hear me?

217
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,953
Engine Room!

218
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,117
Sonar, Conn. Any contacts?

219
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,220
Conn, Sonar. No contacts, sir.

220
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,164
Petty Officer Murray,
give me some good news.

221
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,909
We've crossed into international waters, sir.

222
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,342
Do we have a choice?

223
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,038
No, sir.

224
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,485
This is the Captain. Prepare to surface.

225
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,382
COB, emergency blow.

226
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,589
Chief of the Watch, blow the ballast tanks.

227
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,131
Hold on, gentlemen.

228
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,180
Petty Officer Savage, you and your men
saved the ship. Well done.

229
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,519
Thank you, sir.

230
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,460
We've got two with moderate injuries.

231
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,258
Engineering Officer Makwana is deceased.

232
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,329
And the XO is critical.

233
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,896
I've done everything I can for him, Captain.

234
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,233
He's on morphine, so he's not in any pain.

235
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,829
I've put him on the wardroom table for now.

236
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,610
Hey, Tom.

237
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,221
Captain.

238
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,387
Did we put the fire out?

239
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,322
Yes, the fire's out.

240
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,262
Your surface medevac chopper's on the way.

241
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,429
I don't think I'm going to make it, Frank.

242
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,531
Of course you're going to make it.

243
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,229
You never were a good liar.

244
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,737
You still have it.

245
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,446
I should have kept it with me.

246
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,542
You keep it in your hand
and everything will be fine.

247
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,817
Promise me you'll find that submarine.

248
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,322
I will. You have my word.

249
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,182
They ambushed us.

250
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,292
You save your strength. All right?

251
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,159
I'm so cold, Frank.

252
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,963
Hang in there, Tom.

253
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,496
It's been great.

254
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,440
Tom, you stay with me.

255
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,639
Tom, stay with me.

256
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,839
Okay.

257
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,846
Tom.

258
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,816
Tom!

259
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,862
He's gone, sir.

260
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,737
I'm sorry, Captain.

261
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,785
Captain to the Conn.

262
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,147
We're preparing for medevac.

263
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,349
Repeat, Captain to the Conn.

264
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,254
This is the Captain. I'm on my way.

265
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,996
I have the Conn.

266
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,201
Captain has the Conn.

267
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,834
Captain, a message from Com Sub Pac
in Pearl.

268
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:57,871
Murray.

269
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,547
Plot a course of rendezvous
with the battle group from Yokohama.

270
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,448
They'll escort us into port.

271
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,759
I'm very sorry, Captain.

272
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,162
Don't you men have work to do?

273
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,399
What's our speed?

274
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,132
Only five knots.
The propeller's been severely damaged.

275
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,602
All ahead full.

276
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,470
Give me what you can.

277
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,817
All ahead full with what we can.

278
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:36,184
Sir, recommend course 150.

279
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:45,695
COB, come right, 15-degree rudder.
Steady course, 150.

280
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,526
Aye, sir.

281
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,702
Right, 15-degree rudder.
Steady course at 150.

282
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,435
XO has....

283
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,231
Navigation Officer has the Conn.

284
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,837
Navigation Officer has the Conn.

285
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,940
Fire present.

286
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,376
Fire commence.

287
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,579
Fire commence.

288
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,712
Fire commence.

289
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:10,673
Lt. Trifoli, on behalf of a grateful nation
and a proud Navy...

290
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,947
I present this flag to you
in recognition of your brother's years...

291
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,488
of honorable and faithful service
to his country.

292
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:20,951
Thank you.

293
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,875
I'm Cmdr. Frank Habley.

294
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,646
Your brother was my executive officer.

295
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,079
Lt. Claire Trifoli, Naval lntelligence.

296
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,078
I would like to offer
my sincere condolences.

297
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,276
Thank you, sir.

298
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:52,248
Tom and I were good friends for many years.

299
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,051
I'm sorry we never met before.

300
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,688
My brother and I were estranged
for a very long time, Commander.

301
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,265
Yes, I know.

302
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,931
Both of our parents died
when we were quite young.

303
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,532
We lived with our grandparents,
and Tom joined the Navy.

304
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,676
I didn't hear from him for a lot of years.

305
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,240
I know he wanted to make it up to you.

306
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,982
You know, the funny thing is we spoke
just a couple of months ago.

307
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,283
We were going to try to see each other
when this tour was through.

308
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,417
I guess that's not going to happen now,
is it, sir?

309
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:34,155
If you'll excuse me, sir,
my husband's waiting for me.

310
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,434
I understand.

311
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,373
Lt. Trifoli.

312
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,904
Perhaps we could meet over coffee.

313
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:52,211
I'd like to tell you about your brother,
about the fine man that I knew.

314
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,917
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think that's necessary.

315
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,324
Good day, Commander.

316
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:13,399
I'll take you home.

317
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,940
Lt. Trifoli blames me for Tom's death,
I know it.

318
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,070
Did she say that?

319
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,945
She didn't have to say anything.
I saw it on her face.

320
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,281
It wasn't your fault.
We were attacked and you did your best.

321
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,150
-Did l?
-Yes, you did.

322
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,518
And you shouldn't question that.
You saved the boat.

323
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,025
The men who saved the boat
are either dead or dying.

324
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,755
It was my decision to head for the trench.

325
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,059
And it was the right decision.

326
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,397
All right.

327
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,697
I bury Makwana tomorrow in Washington.

328
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,500
I spoke with his mother
for about an hour today.

329
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,378
She's devastated.
Her whole world is turning upside down.

330
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,018
These are hard times...

331
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,214
and there's a whole lot of pain to go around.

332
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,460
I saw that boat, Dizzy.

333
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:13,029
I saw it as plainly
as I see you standing next to me.

334
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:18,233
It's a phantom, waiting out there,
posing a danger to our entire fleet.

335
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,669
The Navy thinks I'm lying
to cover up my mistakes.

336
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:26,577
I believe you, Captain.

337
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,309
And I've always been proud
to serve by your side.

338
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,582
You're my rock, Dizzy.

339
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,285
Thank you for being my friend.

340
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,992
After extensive interviews with your crew...

341
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,028
and a collection
of your mission intelligence...

342
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,189
our initial conclusion
is that you were attacked...

343
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,290
by a North Korean
antisubmarine warfare plane.

344
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,004
Your location was discovered
when you went to periscope depth...

345
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,631
and they launched a torpedo attack
from the air.

346
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,801
This accounts
for the lack of a sonar signature.

347
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,775
We examined your sonar logs...

348
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,010
we tested the equipment...

349
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,518
and we found it to be properly calibrated
and in working order.

350
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,152
So, let me ask you this, Commander:

351
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,420
if you did see a submarine, why didn't you
capture it on the periscope camera?

352
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,527
Lt. Cmdr. Palatonio manned that scope, sir.

353
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,429
I don't know
why he didn't record the sighting.

354
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,427
He confirmed the visual contact
was an unknown class of submarine.

355
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,604
It wasn't Russian, Chinese,
or a Korean design.

356
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,870
It was a class of submarine
we had never seen before.

357
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,070
Because the visibility was poor...

358
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,510
isn't it possible
that you really don't know what you saw?

359
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,076
No, sir.

360
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,945
I know I saw that submarine.

361
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:18,415
Perhaps its stealth technology...

362
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,981
is something
our intelligence hasn't identified yet.

363
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,551
I hardly think that's possible, Commander.

364
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:27,391
If the North Koreans had a stealth weapon,
we would know about it.

365
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,634
Commander, we suggest
you take some time for yourself.

366
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,233
Losing your executive officer
has to have been rough.

367
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,869
We realize that you were close friends.

368
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,306
Take your leave, Commander.

369
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,076
Go practice your swing.

370
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:48,612
Are you relieving me of my duty, sir?

371
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,879
How'd it go, Commander?

372
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,084
Twenty-one years, Dizzy. It's over in a flash.

373
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,421
What did they say?

374
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,325
Their minds are made up.

375
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,593
Two men are dead and a $1 billion boat
is severely damaged.

376
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,829
They don't usually give you
the keys to another submarine.

377
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,268
Your record as a naval commander
is second to none.

378
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:10,240
Dereliction of duty with deaths involved
is grounds for a court martial.

379
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,501
They want me to take some time off.

380
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,771
I think you should do what they say.
It's out of your hands now.

381
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,681
Launch the alert fighter.
Possible bogeys, bearing 360.

382
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,952
Smoke 1 1, airborne.

383
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,555
Strike copies.

384
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,796
Smoke 1 1, proceed north
and get a visual ID when able.

385
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,896
Smoke 1 1, copy. Negative radar contact.

386
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,765
I want you to be straight
with me, Commander.

387
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,471
I want you to tell me
what really happened out there.

388
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,781
I can't discuss the details
of the mission, Lieutenant.

389
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,448
Court of lnquiry's deliberating...

390
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,951
and I have nothing to say
until the verdict is handed down.

391
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,614
I would have expected
a different response from you.

392
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,751
I lost my closest friend, Lieutenant.

393
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:40,293
When I sleep, I see Tom calling out to me
from the flames, and I can't reach him.

394
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,526
No matter how hard I try, I can't reach him.

395
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:48,202
My team has been asked
to break down intel in that area.

396
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,140
Everything points
to your submarine being detected.

397
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,971
And instead of going
into international waters...

398
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,571
you made the decision
to go deeper into the military zone...

399
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,138
right into the Chousan Trench.

400
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,947
I didn't know you were an expert
in submarine tactics, Lieutenant.

401
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,010
Sir, if there would have been
a stealth submarine...

402
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,716
we would have learned about it
long before it was even operational.

403
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,452
I know what I saw.

404
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:12,062
I'm gonna find out the truth, Cmdr. Habley.

405
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,896
I would expect nothing less. That's your job.

406
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:19,335
Yes, sir,
and yours is to make the right decisions...

407
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,201
every hour, 100% of the time.

408
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,902
I'm fully aware of my job, Lieutenant.

409
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,506
I've just spent the entire week in front
of a Court of lnquiry being reminded of it.

410
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,812
Yes, sir.

411
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,143
Good day, Commander.

412
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:50,032
Smoke 11. I've got four,
repeat, four Korean MiGs on my tail.

413
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,592
We are defensive.

414
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,066
Smoke 1 1, Strike copies.

415
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,144
I've got Smoke 21, flight of two,
heading your way.

416
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,870
Smoke 21 flight, burners now.

417
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,750
Smoke 21 radar contact, bearing 360.

418
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,517
We'll be there in a few.

419
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,389
Smoke 1 1, still defensive.
I can't shake this guy.

420
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:21,998
I need your help.

421
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:26,935
Smoke 1 1, I'm in a gut defense.

422
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,264
Smoke 21 flight, cut right.

423
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,502
We got you covered. You're cleared off.

424
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,202
I'm hit. I'm hit!

425
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,611
Smoke 1 1, shut down my right engine.

426
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,613
Smoke 21, this is Strike.

427
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,211
We're showing the remaining MiGs
bugging out.

428
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:48,055
Smoke 1 1, I'm returning to base.

429
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:50,819
Smoke 21 is trailing one. Engaging.

430
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,771
Smoke 21 is pulling for a shot.

431
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,815
We've confirmed reports
that a US Navy Tomcat...

432
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,584
on routine patrol over the Sea of Japan...

433
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,125
was attacked by North Korean MiG fighters.

434
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,195
The Pentagon stated that US warplanes...

435
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:28,393
quickly came to the pilot's aid
and shot down one of the attackers.

436
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,670
North Korea claims the US plane
had invaded its airspace...

437
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:37,505
and is calling the action a provocation
for war and is threatening retaliation.

438
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,076
Lt. Cmdr. Barker.

439
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,448
You've come very highly recommended
from all your previous commanders.

440
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,684
I see you've served on three boats
with tours in the Mediterranean...

441
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,249
the Persian Gulf and the Atlantic.

442
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,294
I've been very fortunate, sir.

443
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,929
I see you also graduated from your
Prospective Commanding Officer course...

444
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,297
in the top of your class.

445
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,730
Looks like you're ready
to command your own boat.

446
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,635
It's been a lifelong dream, Admiral.

447
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,503
I'm sure it has been.

448
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:13,339
Are you aware of the situation
with North Korea?

449
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,475
Yes, sir.

450
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,909
What I'm about to ask you
isn't gonna be easy.

451
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,645
We need you to be part of a team...

452
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,623
for a covert operation
off the coast of North Korea.

453
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,826
But we need Cmdr. Habley to be the captain.

454
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,256
You want me to be his executive officer?

455
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,391
Yes.

456
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,592
How's it going?

457
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,629
-I'm Lt. Cmdr. Steven Barker.
-Cmdr. Frank Habley.

458
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:44,001
I know. It's a pleasure.

459
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,838
Have we met?

460
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:49,745
No. I've actually been following your career
for quite some time.

461
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,748
It's been an inspiration to me.

462
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,142
You know anything about the Commander?

463
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,552
I just know what I've heard.
They say he's a solid officer.

464
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:01,957
He's seen combat.
His men respect him and they're very loyal.

465
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:06,856
Some say he's been at sea too long,
that he spooks easily.

466
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,201
The jury's still out on that one.

467
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:14,768
Well, it's very flattering, Mr. Barker,
but you might want to change your mind.

468
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,698
I'm sure you've heard.

469
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,834
Just bits and pieces.

470
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:23,579
I can't imagine what you're going through.

471
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,043
A captain has to make hard decisions,
has to trust his instincts.

472
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:31,246
Navy thinks I got it wrong.

473
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,086
I'm in a tough spot.

474
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:37,388
Habley's an expert at navigating
those waters and we need his experience.

475
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:42,159
But if I ask him,
I doubt that he'd agree to another mission.

476
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,191
That's where you come into play.

477
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,102
I've been asked by Admiral Sommerville
to put together a team...

478
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:50,266
for a Special Projects mission
off North Korea.

479
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,203
I told him I wanted you
to command the boat.

480
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,240
We need you to approach him
as though this was your idea.

481
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,116
You tell him that you've patterned
your career after his...

482
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:04,918
that you hold him in such high regard
that you want him to command the boat.

483
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,259
I'm about to face a court martial trial,
Mr. Barker.

484
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,963
I don't think the Admiral
would even consider your request.

485
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,899
If you accept my offer,
he's authorized you to command the boat.

486
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,531
He's in a bad place right now.
But we need him.

487
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:28,069
You're an expert in navigating those waters.
I need you on my team, sir.

488
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,805
Just not going to happen.

489
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,008
Please, think about it.

490
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,418
A lot of your crew are already
on the Poseidon awaiting a captain.

491
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,352
He's still the Captain of the boat.

492
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:41,492
Officially...

493
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,057
you'll share all command decisions
with regard to the overall mission...

494
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,620
with our full support.

495
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:51,635
Unofficially, you're to do what's ever
necessary to take control of the boat...

496
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,971
so that nothing impedes the mission...

497
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,236
particularly Cmdr. Habley's
psychological state.

498
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,073
It's never the same after you lose men.

499
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:05,448
Commander, we can honor those men
with a successful mission.

500
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,851
Look, give me a call either way.

501
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,160
Do you understand your orders,
Lieutenant Commander?

502
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:18,993
Yes, sir.

503
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:23,862
By the way, it's an honor
to finally meet you, Cmdr. Habley.

504
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:45,150
I asked around.
This Barker graduated the top of his class.

505
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:49,419
Came up the hard way.
He's by the book, with no gray areas.

506
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,592
He seems sharp and confident.

507
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,960
Food's up.

508
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,193
-Here.
-Thanks.

509
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,494
This is wonderful, Becky...

510
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,903
but you shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

511
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:05,637
It's no trouble, Frank. I know
you must get sick of your TV dinners.

512
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:12,082
So, are you going?

513
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:16,954
I don't know.

514
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,287
This could be a good chance
for you to prove them wrong.

515
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:27,732
Can I have the soy sauce? Thanks.

516
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,131
This mission sounds pretty important.

517
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,940
I haven't decided yet.

518
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:46,678
Frank, we've known you for a long time.

519
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,849
We've never doubted you or your choices.

520
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,880
Every time you and Dizzy go on duty...

521
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:56,860
I trust you with the man I love
more than anyone in this world.

522
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,856
Thank you, Becky.

523
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,527
I know that Tom would have wanted you
to return.

524
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:10,039
Yeah. That's what I promised him.

525
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,037
-...or will you do it?
-Yes, sir.

526
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,976
Cmdr. Habley. Welcome back.

527
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,217
-Good to have you on board.
-Thank you, sir.

528
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,916
This is Capt. Galasso
from Naval lntelligence.

529
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,422
-Captain.
-Commander.

530
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,189
Gentlemen, let's get started.

531
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,473
The North Koreans have threatened
to retaliate for this latest incident.

532
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,840
As we speak, they're mobilizing their forces
throughout the Northern peninsula.

533
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,043
We've been tracking a major deployment
in their diesel submarine fleet...

534
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,107
away from their base at Namp'o.

535
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:58,515
Our mission is to place a tap
on their communications cable...

536
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,650
Ieading away from their submarine base
at Namp'o, here off the Bay of Korea.

537
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:07,688
The cable runs here, through
the Yellow Sea, to the Chinese mainland.

538
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:12,394
This is one of the largest shallow areas
of continental shelf in the world.

539
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,106
Cmdr. Habley, would you like
to talk about this a little bit?

540
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,143
I've been through
the Yellow River channel many times.

541
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,647
The depth of the Yellow Sea is shallow.
About 500 feet.

542
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,706
The waters over the shelf are noisy...

543
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,843
so sound waves are distorted
in this coastal zone.

544
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,150
Plus, there's lots of traffic.

545
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,752
These factors should help us avoid
detection and complete the mission.

546
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,556
There's been an increase
in the amount of chatter.

547
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,121
We need a detailed account
of those communications...

548
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,259
and to know where their subs are going.

549
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,395
Your mission tactics are based
on our success during the Cold War...

550
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,599
when we tapped the Soviets' cable.

551
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,268
You're gonna be carrying
a newly developed submersible.

552
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,541
Capt. Galasso will brief us
on that aspect of the mission.

553
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,976
We'll be deploying a remote control
submersible we call the "Crab."

554
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,418
Basically, it's a $5 million video camera
with robotic arms.

555
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,353
Normally, we'd have to use divers for this.

556
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,950
But now we can place the tap with the robot,
bring it back to the submarine...

557
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,824
and leave, undetected.

558
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,328
I can't stress enough
the importance of this mission.

559
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,197
Due to the highly classified equipment
and the files on board...

560
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,896
should you become trapped
by hostile forces...

561
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,365
we can't allow you to be boarded
or to be taken alive.

562
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,235
Cmdr. Habley and Lt. Cmdr. Barker...

563
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,669
will each have keys
to arm a self-destruct timer.

564
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,673
You both must initiate
the command together.

565
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,843
Is that understood, gentlemen?

566
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:35,908
Yes, sir.

567
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,243
Yes, sir.

568
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,346
Good luck and Godspeed.

569
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,146
Heard any more about the new XO?

570
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,951
Sommerville's given him equal command
on the mission.

571
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,255
They've brought in a babysitter
because they don't trust me out there.

572
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,990
Barker's a decent enough guy, I'm told,
but he's their man.

573
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,923
Think he'll be trouble?

574
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,299
I just hope he's smart enough
to stay out of my way.

575
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,737
Attention on deck.

576
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,742
At ease. Good morning, gentlemen.

577
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,513
-Morning, Captain.
-Good morning, sir.

578
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,816
All crew present and accounted for, sir.

579
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,346
COB, this is our new XO,
Lt. Cmdr. Steven Barker.

580
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,492
Mr. Barker,
this is Chief of the Boat, Dizzy Malone.

581
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,154
Best COB in the submarine fleet.

582
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,965
Dizzy and I served on three tours together.

583
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,831
Pleasure, sir. Welcome aboard.

584
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:35,235
Thank you. So why do they call you Dizzy?

585
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,267
Well, sir, when I was in naval flight school,
I suffered from vertigo.

586
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,867
That's not good for a pilot...

587
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:44,540
so I thought maybe going the other way
might make a better choice.

588
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,274
All right.

589
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,412
XO, why's the entry hatch still open
and the mooring lines attached?

590
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,149
We're waiting for the
Special Projects Team, Captain.

591
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,988
Waiting? We're supposed
to be getting underway.

592
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,721
Yes, sir. I know.

593
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,922
Do you have any idea
when they're supposed to arrive...

594
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,591
or would you like me
to shut down the reactor and wait?

595
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,658
I'll radio Command
and get that information, Captain.

596
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,830
Very good, Mr. Barker. XO has the Conn.

597
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,671
I have the Conn.

598
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,079
Capt. Galasso,
I would have appreciated a heads-up.

599
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,244
We're late getting underway.

600
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,653
Adm. Sommerville kept me longer
than expected with some last-minute details.

601
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,952
You understand.

602
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,552
Capt. Habley, this is Agt. Winters,
special operative with the NSA.

603
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,962
He's an expert in communication
surveillance and he speaks fluent Korean.

604
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,364
Winters. Welcome aboard, gentlemen.

605
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,425
Good to be here, Captain.

606
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,965
This is Lt. Claire Trifoli, Naval lntelligence.

607
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,137
Capt. Habley. My orders, sir.

608
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,912
Trifoli's testing classified equipment.

609
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,383
This is unprecedented.

610
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,682
Admiral Sommerville's orders.

611
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,682
Welcome aboard, Lt. Trifoli.

612
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,650
Thank you, sir.

613
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,353
We should get settled.

614
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,129
Follow me, please.

615
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:16,897
Ma'am.

616
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,432
Captain didn't seem too happy to see you,
Trifoli. He know you?

617
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,068
We met once before.

618
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,044
These sub commanders are a different
breed.

619
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,707
Never know what to expect.

620
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,049
Stuck for six months in this tube,
make anybody crazy.

621
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,021
Reminds me of summer camp.

622
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,557
Hey, we're lucky.

623
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:38,719
Forty percent of the enlisted crew have to
share bunks, rotate sleeping schedules.

624
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,731
It's called hot bunking.

625
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,823
Nice.

626
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,968
Navy. "It's not just a job, it's an adventure."

627
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,804
All right, gentlemen, we're underway.
Let's get down to business.

628
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:01,850
I have the Conn.

629
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,144
Captain has the Conn.

630
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:05,946
Up periscope.

631
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,127
Approaching dive point, Captain.

632
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,129
XO, submerge the boat.

633
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,141
Diving Officer, submerge the boat.

634
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:29,808
Submerging the boat. Dive, dive, dive.

635
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,690
Make your depth 150 feet.

636
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,818
Diving to 150 feet.

637
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,892
150 feet, aye.

638
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,732
Deck's awash.

639
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,734
All vents open.

640
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:52,996
All vents open.

641
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,132
Scope's under.

642
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:03,440
All ahead full, course 175.

643
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,876
175, Captain.

644
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,629
Sir, we just got word our carrier battle
group has just entered the Yellow Sea.

645
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,896
That's good news. We may need the backup.

646
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,501
Are you expecting trouble?

647
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,937
We're going behind enemy lines, Mr. Barker.

648
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,036
It will be good to know we've got support
if we need to change tactics.

649
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,809
Well, sir, our mission orders are set.

650
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,677
We have our job,
the carrier group has theirs.

651
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,150
Battle is fluid. Things change.

652
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:46,983
This is a covert mission, sir.

653
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,582
We get in and out
without slamming the door.

654
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,086
That's the idea.

655
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:04,634
Okay?

656
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:10,075
"...what's up with you?"
I said, "Not much, you know...."

657
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:15,206
Hey, Savage. Wonder what kind of slop
they're gonna feed us today.

658
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,320
Hey, guys, you heard about our Captain?

659
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,356
He hears things that go bump in the deep.

660
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,188
He has a sixth sense.

661
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:27,155
Yeah? Let's just hope
he doesn't see dead people, too.

662
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,922
He's one of the best captains in the fleet.

663
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,202
I'm sorry. Was I talking to you, Savage?

664
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,472
I served with him on the Santa Maria.

665
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,099
Yeah, I'm sure you guys became very close.

666
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,111
I just thought if you wanted to gossip,
you might as well get your story straight.

667
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,745
Well, if word gets out
how big your mouth is...

668
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,409
somebody's gonna put it to good use.

669
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,584
-Come on, guys! Take it easy.
-Take it easy.

670
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,927
-Hey, Savage, get in there, man.
-That's enough.

671
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,395
Get in there, Savage!

672
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,133
Break it up now! Come on!

673
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:09,698
Come here.

674
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,006
What the hell is going on here, Savage?

675
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,169
Sorry, Chief. It was just a misunderstanding.

676
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,305
I don't wanna see this again.
That goes for all of you.

677
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:22,508
You think this is a playground?
You're responsible for each other's lives!

678
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,650
-You understand that?
-Yes, Chief.

679
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,917
You watch your tone, Buckley.

680
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,520
Aye, sir.

681
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,585
I should write you both up,
but I'm not going to.

682
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,162
Kitchen duty for two days,
and clean this mess up!

683
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,294
Aye, sir.

684
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:46,770
Trouble, Chief?

685
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,074
Everything's fine, sir.
The men are just a little on edge.

686
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,643
Can't have our crew
fighting with each other.

687
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,707
No, sir. They understand.

688
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,585
Just the same, put those two men on report.

689
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,488
Sir, I gave them kitchen duty for two days.

690
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,525
Put them on report.

691
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:07,155
It'll let everyone know that things
are tightening up around here.

692
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:11,623
And let's find out how ready our fire team is.
Fire drill in one hour.

693
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,339
Captain usually waits
until we're a few days out, sir.

694
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,599
I want my fire team ready.

695
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,836
One hour, Chief.

696
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,804
Yes, sir.

697
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,148
So, how close do we have to get
to the cable?

698
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,276
Well, the Crab has a range
of about 4,000 yards on remote control.

699
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,719
I like to run about half that just to be safe.

700
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,655
Good. The further we are
from the channel, the better.

701
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:38,354
The North Koreans are running submarine
maneuvers from their base at Namp'o.

702
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,589
They brought out their diesel clunkers?

703
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,395
They might be old compared to ours,
but they still pose a threat.

704
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,936
Remember when we tracked
one of their subs for two hours...

705
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,438
just by listening to the noise
from their toilets?

706
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:53,567
I figured a lot of them must have had
something really bad to eat that day.

707
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,178
I'm sorry. Tell me, Captain...

708
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,612
I've heard you submariners
get so familiar with the sea...

709
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,014
you can hear some things that we can't.

710
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,352
That's right.

711
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,520
Down here, you become in tune
with your surroundings.

712
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,354
Becomes instinctual.

713
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,758
It's true, your ears get bigger down here.

714
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,061
I can track a surface ship and tell exactly
how many blades are on its propeller.

715
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,297
I don't have much faith
in something I can't see.

716
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,371
You're not a religious man?

717
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:27,741
I trust science.
Either you have proof or you don't.

718
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:32,772
The gray areas are just puzzles
that science hasn't solved yet.

719
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,746
Not much mystery in your world.

720
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,454
Guess that's why we have
the most sophisticated equipment onboard.

721
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,584
Amen to that.
I'll trust my computer over anyone.

722
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,761
A machine is only as good as its operator.

723
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,793
Couldn't agree with you more, Captain.

724
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,301
What exactly
is your mission onboard, Lieutenant?

725
00:52:56,573 --> 00:53:00,441
Actually, I'm operating a prototype
that analyzes underwater color gradations.

726
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,570
It also reports the data
on thermocline layers.

727
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,876
I'm really excited about this, actually.

728
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,387
If it's successful,
it will become standard on all submarines.

729
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:17,419
This is just a drill.
I gave the orders for 1800...

730
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,453
but evidently
the Chief misunderstood those orders.

731
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:25,700
This is the XO. This is a drill.
I repeat, this is a drill.

732
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,836
Firefighting team,
meet me in the Engine Room, now.

733
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,174
I don't like surprises,
Lieutenant Commander.

734
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,142
Neither do l, sir.

735
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,441
If you'll excuse me.

736
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,875
Enter.

737
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,682
I know what you're gonna say.

738
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,315
Fire drill? Take a seat, Dizzy.

739
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,359
Look, right after the XO saw the fight,
he gave the order to run the drill.

740
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,658
What fight?

741
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,063
It was nothing.
I didn't wanna bother you with it.

742
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:00,501
Some of the men were blowing off steam
in the galley.

743
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,968
One of the new petty officers, Buckley,
was talking smack about you.

744
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,904
Savage decided to shut him up.

745
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,171
Is this a problem?

746
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,941
No, sir. Just an idiot running his big mouth.

747
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:14,675
I gave them kitchen duty,
but the XO wanted me to write them up.

748
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,447
He told me you misunderstood
when he wanted to call the drill.

749
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:21,685
No, sir. Right after the fight,
he ordered me to run the drill in an hour.

750
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,695
Seems Mr. Barker is flexing his command,
and he's got the Admiral to back him up.

751
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,663
You let me know about any other surprises.

752
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,997
Yes, sir.

753
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,168
I'm getting that strange feeling, Dizzy.

754
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:41,568
It's too quiet out there.
You know what I mean?

755
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,906
Yeah, it's eerie.

756
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,136
I'm getting North Korean
ship-to-ship communications.

757
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,839
Now they're saying something
about floating wreckage.

758
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:17,243
Sea of Japan.
They're giving longitude and latitude.

759
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,509
Say what it was?

760
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,072
No, hold on, hold on.

761
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:24,950
What?

762
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:28,089
They're reporting an oil slick and bodies.

763
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:30,182
Keep on it.

764
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:33,162
Sir, I'm getting some
interesting findings here.

765
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,127
I've been tracking these color changes
for the past hour. You see here?

766
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:45,164
This water displacement's been
continually changing in a zigzag pattern.

767
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:46,732
What is that, a whale?

768
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:49,473
It would be the biggest whale
known to man.

769
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:52,277
There's over 8,000 tons of displacement.

770
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,843
A whale is about 45 tons, max.

771
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:59,622
Currents in this area
are known to be very strong.

772
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,886
Yes, I'm aware of that.

773
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,887
Should I check with the sonar officer,
see if they reported anything?

774
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,022
No. No, we'll track it from here.

775
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,559
Relaying message from base at Yokosuka...

776
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:16,037
to carriers and subs in the Yellow Sea.
Urgent relay.

777
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:22,274
Sir, I just received an urgent message
from the base at Yokosuka.

778
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,105
Read it.

779
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:29,744
"Japanese Yushio class submarine Osaka
reported missing in the Sea of Japan.

780
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,152
"Search underway. Will advise."

781
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:34,523
Sir, should I notify the Captain?

782
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:37,493
No. I have the Conn. I'll take care of this.

783
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:40,820
This information is not to leave your room.

784
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:42,823
Is that understood, Roperto?

785
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,162
Yes, sir.

786
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:45,733
Dismissed.

787
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,508
I have the Conn.

788
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,373
Captain has the Conn.

789
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:58,906
XO.

790
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,678
Captain?

791
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,956
How did your firefighting team score?

792
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:18,968
Top marks, sir.
I shaved five minutes off their time.

793
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,833
Good. Helmsman, what's our depth?

794
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:24,268
-200 feet, Captain.
-Speed?

795
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,875
20 knots, sir.

796
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:28,675
Slow to 10 knots and turn on my mark.

797
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:32,307
Come right, 15-degree rudder. Course 180.

798
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:36,982
Slowing to 10 knots, turning on your mark,
right 15-degree rudder.

799
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,952
Course 180, Captain.

800
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,818
180. Aye.

801
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,425
Sir, why are we heading to 180?

802
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:48,558
The underwater mountains
in this area are dangerous.

803
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,066
Some of the peaks rise 100 feet or more.

804
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:54,695
The currents are strong.
We could run right into the mountainside.

805
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:58,503
We'll bypass this ridge,
go around here, and then turn back.

806
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,608
Diving Officer, make your turn...

807
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,407
come right, 180.

808
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:09,214
Right, 15-degree rudder.
Course, 180, Captain.

809
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,181
Sir, I'd appreciate...

810
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:15,157
if you'd notify me of any operational
changes before you made them.

811
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:17,626
I'm glad we're in agreement, Mr. Barker.

812
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:20,288
Conn, Sonar.

813
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,059
Permission to play the whale song.

814
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:24,794
This is my favorite time of the voyage.

815
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,030
It's migration season, Mr. Barker.

816
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:31,438
We're not the only ones down here.
Sonar, Conn. Proceed.

817
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:40,148
Captain, unless you need me,
I request permission to go below.

818
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,911
No, I don't need you. Dismissed.

819
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:03,465
Jeez!

820
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:17,309
Looks like we got a Japanese submarine
missing, Yushio class.

821
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,583
-Does Captain know?
-I held the message.

822
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:22,387
Good. We just intercepted
a North Korean report.

823
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:24,825
Floating wreckage and bodies
in the Sea of Japan.

824
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:26,624
Is it the Japanese submarine?

825
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,358
We don't know yet.

826
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:30,797
I don't think we need to bother the Captain
with this.

827
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,733
We need to keep him
focused on the mission.

828
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:36,603
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, I think you might be interested in this.

829
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:43,946
Been tracking a massive turbulent wake,
5,000, 10,000 yards off the port side.

830
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:49,019
The water's been cavitating with bubbles
from something mechanical, like a propeller.

831
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,111
Well, our propellers
will kick up more bubbles...

832
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,622
as we get into the shallows
of the Yellow Sea.

833
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:57,457
The currents, the sea traffic there,
they play havoc on our readings.

834
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,389
We're in a whales' migration path.

835
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:04,298
Sir, this displacement is much too large
for whales.

836
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,598
Is this your first sea trials?

837
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,930
Yes, sir, it is.

838
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:12,742
I think that we should contact
the sonar officer with our reports.

839
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,243
You can't trust these readings...

840
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:17,178
and I don't want you interrupting anyone
in the control room with this.

841
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,272
-Sir--
-ls that understood?

842
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:23,748
Yes, sir.

843
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,055
Lieutenant Commander.

844
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,695
Why have we changed course?

845
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:39,793
The Captain says we're navigating
around some strong currents.

846
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,737
We'll be back on course
as soon as he gets around this area.

847
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,468
You keep a tight leash on him,
Lt. Cmdr. Barker.

848
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,442
I've got him contained.

849
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,852
Message from
National Military Command Center, sir.

850
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:02,091
"Update on previous communication.

851
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:05,893
"Missing Japanese
Yushio class submarine Osaka confirmed.

852
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,625
"Attacked and sunk in the Sea of Japan.

853
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,667
"There are no survivors.
Proceed with caution."

854
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:13,362
-Why wasn't I informed of this?
-I don't know, sir.

855
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:15,200
Get Roperto in here.

856
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,341
Corey.

857
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,478
Captain?

858
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,483
Roperto, why wasn't I informed
of the original message?

859
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:32,647
Sir?

860
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:35,455
The missing Yushio class submarine.

861
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:39,223
Sir, I gave that message to the XO.
He told me he'd take care of it.

862
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,629
I want every communication
to go through me first. Is that understood?

863
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,134
-Yes, Captain.
-Dismissed, Roperto.

864
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:52,200
That submarine was sunk within 50 miles
from where they hit us.

865
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:58,106
Deploy sonar array,
starboard side, maximum range.

866
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,042
Maximum range, Captain.

867
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:17,731
Just between us, I think the Admiral
has a soft spot for her.

868
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,535
So, when she lobbied for the position
and he agreed...

869
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:23,164
he thought it would help her
work through her brother's death.

870
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,333
-Her brother?
-Palatonio.

871
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:28,210
That explains the attitude.

872
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:31,645
If it was left up to me, I would have
never brought the excess baggage.

873
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:32,739
XO to the Conn.

874
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:33,840
XO to the Conn.

875
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,386
Captain?

876
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:46,862
All communications are to go through me
first. Is that clear, Mr. Barker?

877
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,259
Yes, sir.

878
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:51,731
I think it's important to know
when an allied submarine is missing.

879
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:56,239
I'm sorry, Captain. I figured you had enough
to worry about with the navigation.

880
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:59,965
I was gonna relay the message
as soon as you had a spare moment.

881
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,344
We just received confirmation.

882
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:06,349
It was attacked and sunk
by unknown forces.

883
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:08,111
There were no survivors.

884
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:13,887
Captain, towed sonar array
reaching maximum deployment.

885
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:20,592
We're rigged for silent running.
I don't think that's a good idea.

886
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,264
I think it's a good idea.

887
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,605
Conn, Sonar. The cable hit something big.

888
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:43,550
Designate contact Sierra 1. Bearing 050.

889
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:46,182
Estimated range 1,000 yards.

890
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:56,221
WEPS, start your track
for a fire control solution on Sierra 1.

891
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,666
Make Tubes 1 and 4 ready in all respects.

892
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,809
Captain, exactly what are you doing?

893
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,640
I don't want them to get the jump on us.

894
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:12,011
Who? We don't have a positive identification
on any contact.

895
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:17,211
Conn, Sonar. Sierra 1 has disappeared.
Last known bearing: 059.

896
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:19,148
She's gone, sir.

897
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:24,956
COB, turn right. Course, 130.

898
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,687
Make your depth 400 feet.

899
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,994
Course 130. Depth 400 feet, Captain.

900
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:32,928
400 feet, aye.

901
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:38,235
Chief of the Boat, cut the sonar cable.

902
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:52,154
Chief of the Boat, I gave you a direct order.
Did you not understand those orders?

903
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:01,860
Cut that damn cable.

904
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:17,747
We have operational orders, Captain,
to stay on course.

905
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,714
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

906
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:22,843
Tactical decisions
override operational considerations.

907
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,789
Until we have a positive identification
on that contact, we are to stay on course.

908
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:30,326
You agreed to those terms
before we left Pearl.

909
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:33,955
I don't take chances with my crew
or my boat, Mr. Barker.

910
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,533
You shouldn't, either.

911
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,991
What's your best guess?

912
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:07,621
Could be an underwater sonar buoy
or garbage, maybe some wreckage.

913
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:08,995
I'm working on it.

914
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:11,500
Sir, my readings are off the chart here.

915
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:13,695
There's a massive turbulence
on the starboard side--

916
01:06:13,771 --> 01:06:17,172
We're in a strong current area, Trifoli.
Please just put it in the report.

917
01:06:17,241 --> 01:06:18,708
I'll read it later.

918
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:24,404
First it's there, then it vanishes.
I have no explanation whatsoever.

919
01:06:24,782 --> 01:06:26,079
Well, find one.

920
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,553
Where you going?

921
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:43,422
I need a shower.
It's been a really long two days.

922
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,934
Yeah? Well, I need to go with you.

923
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,161
Why? You gonna wash my back for me?

924
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:54,205
There's 130 men on this boat, Lieutenant.
I think you'll appreciate the escort.

925
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:56,746
Aye, Captain.

926
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,352
I don't need her talking to any officers.
You keep on this.

927
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,614
Got it.

928
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:19,568
Hello, Captain. You waiting on the head?

929
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:22,127
No, I'm just waiting for someone in there.

930
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:23,699
They been in there long?

931
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,901
Yeah. It was a long shower.

932
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:32,238
This is Chief of the Boat. No Hollywood
showers. Come on, there, make it quick.

933
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,279
I'll be right there.

934
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,332
Sorry about that, COB.

935
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:57,067
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was you, Lieutenant.

936
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:58,836
All right. Well, we need to get back.

937
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:01,469
Sure thing. COB, you need some more
paper towels in there.

938
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:03,945
I'll have the seaman on bathroom detail
handle that, ma'am.

939
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:06,482
Actually, would you help me out?
I hate a dirty bathroom.

940
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,780
You know, it's a girl thing.
Why don't you do it?

941
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,286
Okay, Lieutenant. I'll take care of that.

942
01:08:11,355 --> 01:08:13,755
We've got work to do, Lieutenant.

943
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:17,683
Lt. Trifoli...

944
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:22,797
I just wanted to say
I served with your brother on three tours.

945
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:26,199
He was always a good friend.
A man of integrity and a fine officer.

946
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,899
He would've been proud
that you're serving on a submarine.

947
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,068
Thanks, COB. I appreciate that.

948
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,520
Trifoli's dead-on with these findings.

949
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:58,898
Something displacing over 8,000 tons
has been hunting us for the past five days.

950
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,165
It's that submarine, COB.

951
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:04,902
They're collecting as much information
about us as possible.

952
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,409
But why haven't they attacked yet?

953
01:09:07,845 --> 01:09:11,372
They want us to lead them
to our carrier group in the Yellow Sea.

954
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,275
I'm not gonna do that.

955
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,318
What are we going to do?

956
01:09:15,686 --> 01:09:18,587
First we have to find
how they evade our sonar.

957
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:23,354
In the meantime, if they wanna hunt us,
we'll lead them back to the Sea of Japan.

958
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,624
The XO won't approve.

959
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,524
The XO's not running this boat.

960
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:29,458
I have the Conn.

961
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:32,093
Captain has the Conn. Quartermaster, aye.

962
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,469
Where we at?

963
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:35,969
Here, sir.

964
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:40,740
Diving Officer, make our course 075.
Rigged for ultra-quiet.

965
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,647
-Course 075, sir.
-075, aye.

966
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:47,143
This is the Captain. Rig for ultra-quiet.

967
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:50,311
-Repeat, rig for ultra-quiet.
-What the hell is he doing?

968
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:53,220
We're 40 miles off-course
and headed for the Sea of Japan.

969
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,851
The Admiral was afraid of this
exact scenario. He's chasing a ghost.

970
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:59,395
Well, I thought you were given
operational command authority.

971
01:09:59,463 --> 01:10:03,058
I was, but the tactical decisions
are still the Captain's.

972
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:05,431
What do you want me to do?
Physically throw him off the Conn?

973
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:08,665
I'm picking up a North Korean
ship-to-ship communication.

974
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:14,108
They have orders to attack any vessel
entering the coastal military zone.

975
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,543
This Captain's jeopardizing my mission.

976
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,344
Up to now I've let you handle things
your way, Mr. Barker...

977
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:20,644
but now we're gonna do it my way.

978
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,810
You were given explicit authority
by the Admiral...

979
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,514
to relieve Capt. Habley of his duty
if necessary.

980
01:10:25,589 --> 01:10:27,113
I suggest you do so.

981
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:29,759
With all due respect, sir...

982
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:35,257
I suggest you never feel the need to
remind me of what my responsibilities are.

983
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:37,358
This is my boat.

984
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,699
Captain.

985
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:44,400
Gentlemen.

986
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:47,500
As of now,
under direct authority from the Admiral...

987
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:51,275
I am relieving you of your command
for dereliction of duty.

988
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,353
We're being hunted, Lieutenant Commander.

989
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,982
I'm trying to prevent this boat
from being attacked.

990
01:11:01,058 --> 01:11:04,084
Unfortunately, your instincts
won't do this time.

991
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:06,152
Do you know these waters?

992
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,825
'Cause if you don't know
what you're doing...

993
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:11,231
these underwater canyons
can tear a boat to pieces.

994
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,134
You are relieved of your command, Captain.

995
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,598
And what if I don't comply?

996
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:22,811
As your superior officer, Captain,
I'm ordering you to stand down.

997
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,582
You don't know what you're doing.

998
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:33,589
Do you? We're 40 miles off-course.

999
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:37,318
So you choose to endanger this boat
and the lives of this crew...

1000
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:39,055
because you don't agree with my command?

1001
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,893
We have orders
that aren't open to your interpretation.

1002
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:45,560
You know, you can really tell
a man's character when you give him power.

1003
01:11:45,936 --> 01:11:48,905
Captain, we're close to placing a track
on the enemy submarine.

1004
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,406
-lf we turn back now--
-Chief of the Watch...

1005
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,909
have someone relieve the helmsman.

1006
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,903
Captain. Your keys.

1007
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:05,282
Your keys, Captain.

1008
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:10,650
Seems you got your boat after all,
Mr. Barker.

1009
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:15,621
Petty Officer Buckley, take Capt. Habley
below and lock him in his stateroom.

1010
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:16,927
Aye, sir.

1011
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:23,731
If you don't use your instincts,
we're all dead.

1012
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,772
I have the Conn.

1013
01:12:34,985 --> 01:12:36,850
XO has the Conn.

1014
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:44,726
Let's get back to work, gentlemen.

1015
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:47,853
Diving Officer, left full rudder.

1016
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:51,058
Change our course back to 150 at 20 knots.

1017
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:55,961
Left full rudder, course 150, 20 knots, sir.

1018
01:12:57,007 --> 01:13:01,535
Sir, that bearing will take us about 1,000
yards into the North Korean military zone.

1019
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:08,780
I don't have a choice, Murray.
The Captain got us into this mess.

1020
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:11,353
We have to maneuver around these peaks.

1021
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:15,585
I don't know this area well enough
to get us straight through.

1022
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:16,921
Yes, sir.

1023
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,534
The keys, Commander.

1024
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,031
Wipe that smirk off your face, son.

1025
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:49,682
-No one gets in here without my permission.
-Yes, sir.

1026
01:14:40,544 --> 01:14:44,173
You know, I would like to read your report
on all this, Lieutenant.

1027
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:47,442
Lieutenant?

1028
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:54,018
I have a report for Capt. Habley.

1029
01:14:54,091 --> 01:14:56,423
I'm sorry, ma'am, but no one's allowed
to see Capt. Habley...

1030
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,017
without Capt. Galasso's authority.

1031
01:14:58,095 --> 01:15:02,156
I actually just passed Capt. Galasso.
He asked me to give this to Capt. Habley.

1032
01:15:02,232 --> 01:15:03,790
It's very important.

1033
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:06,062
Just following orders, ma'am.

1034
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:08,066
That's good to hear.

1035
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:10,634
Would you like me to go get Capt. Galasso?

1036
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:13,437
I'm sure he doesn't have anything
better to do in the control room.

1037
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,035
I can give Capt. Habley your report.

1038
01:15:16,113 --> 01:15:17,512
It's secret.

1039
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:21,846
Have you been cleared for security,
Petty Officer Buckley?

1040
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:23,476
No, Lieutenant.

1041
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:26,950
Well, then I guess you can't give it to him,
can you?

1042
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,991
I'll call Capt. Galasso.

1043
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:33,627
We're rigged for silent running.
You think that's a good idea?

1044
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:38,493
-I guess not, ma'am.
-No, I guess not.

1045
01:15:39,336 --> 01:15:41,236
I gave you your chance.

1046
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,105
Lieutenant.

1047
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,279
You can give your report to the Captain.

1048
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:51,712
Thank you.

1049
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:02,224
Capt. Habley.

1050
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,751
Chief of the Boat Malone
gave me your findings.

1051
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:08,127
-Thank you, Lieutenant.
-I'm glad, sir.

1052
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:11,363
Capt. Habley, I need to apologize to you.

1053
01:16:11,435 --> 01:16:13,835
I really had no right
to treat you the way that I did.

1054
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:18,068
You don't have to apologize.
I know what you're going through.

1055
01:16:18,475 --> 01:16:22,275
Thank you, sir.
This is my latest tracking report.

1056
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,947
I've got the submarine 3,000 yards
and closing off of our starboard side.

1057
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:30,282
We've got to find out
how they remain undetectable.

1058
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:34,718
This technology could sink our entire fleet.
Does Galasso know you're gone?

1059
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,088
I don't think so, sir.

1060
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,786
Better get back.

1061
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,795
Lieutenant.

1062
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:48,436
Your brother scored a hole-in-one
with this ball. Called it his lucky charm.

1063
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:51,464
I thought you might like to have it.

1064
01:16:54,211 --> 01:16:57,146
Thank you, sir. It means a lot to me.

1065
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:02,177
Let's hope it's lucky for us, too.

1066
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:22,965
Conn, Sonar. Broadband contact.

1067
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,200
Designates Sierra 10, Sierra 11.

1068
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:27,837
Both bearings 150.

1069
01:17:27,911 --> 01:17:31,745
Sir, it's a North Korean
frigate and patrol boat, speed 15 knots.

1070
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,146
I think they're onto us.

1071
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,547
How deep is this canyon?

1072
01:17:34,618 --> 01:17:35,983
600 feet, sir.

1073
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:39,814
Diving Officer, take us down to 500 feet.
Ten degree down bubble.

1074
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,358
Down to 500 feet,
10 degree down bubble, sir.

1075
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:44,325
What's your plan, Mr. Barker?

1076
01:17:44,528 --> 01:17:46,894
Well, we're sure as hell
can't outrun those surface ships.

1077
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:49,523
So I'm gonna take us and park us here,
right near this peak.

1078
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:52,534
Look, I don't care how you do it,
you just get us out of this situation.

1079
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:13,845
Sir. Our depth is currently down at 500 feet.

1080
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:21,861
WEPS, load Tubes 2 and 3 with Tomahawks,
seekers on short range.

1081
01:18:28,405 --> 01:18:29,770
Mr. Barker.

1082
01:18:31,608 --> 01:18:34,099
If they find us with active sonar
in this canyon...

1083
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:35,644
we're gonna be totally vulnerable.

1084
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:38,010
And I wanna be ready
to eliminate that threat.

1085
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:58,829
All stop!

1086
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:04,439
What the hell happened?

1087
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:06,938
Conn, Sonar. We hit a rock surface.

1088
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,500
The aft fin is damaged.

1089
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,547
Sierra 10 and Sierra 11, bearing 160.

1090
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:23,451
Conn, Sonar. Torpedoes in the water.

1091
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:24,993
Bearing 150.

1092
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:26,460
Range 2,000 yards...

1093
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:29,020
-and closing fast.
-Man battle stations.

1094
01:19:29,232 --> 01:19:30,995
Man battle stations.

1095
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,943
Conn, Sonar.
Torpedoes made wide turn, now bearing...

1096
01:19:47,017 --> 01:19:50,111
250, range 1,000 yards.

1097
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,083
Time of impact, 30 seconds.

1098
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:57,384
WEPS, deploy countermeasures.

1099
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,134
Diving Officer, bring us back up to 200 feet.

1100
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,600
Back to 200 feet, sir.

1101
01:20:43,473 --> 01:20:45,873
Chief of the Boat,
you get Capt. Habley up here immediately.

1102
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:47,876
-You got it, sir.
-What are you doing, Mr. Barker?

1103
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,536
He's the one who got us into this mess.

1104
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:51,637
You're right.
And he's the only one who can get us out.

1105
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:16,832
Attention on deck.

1106
01:21:17,107 --> 01:21:18,699
I have the Conn.

1107
01:21:18,775 --> 01:21:20,800
Capt. Habley has the Conn.

1108
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:28,840
Captain, by the way, I was wrong.
We are being hunted.

1109
01:21:31,521 --> 01:21:32,988
Where are we?

1110
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,890
You can plug into the GPS system
over there.

1111
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:37,221
Yes, sir.

1112
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,295
Around this peak here, sir.

1113
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:45,095
Lt. Trifoli, when you get a displacement
reading, we'll lock in the coordinates.

1114
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:47,136
I should have it in just a minute, Captain.

1115
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:50,434
There'll be hell to pay
when we get back to Pearl, Captain.

1116
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:53,341
You better pray we can get back to Pearl.

1117
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:10,087
Conn, Sonar.
Sierra 10 and 11 are within 500 yards...

1118
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,184
and closing.

1119
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:13,923
Captain, I've got two Tomahawks
for those ships.

1120
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:16,727
WEPS, lock Tomahawks
onto Sierra 10 and 11.

1121
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,093
Targeting Sierra 10 and 11, sir.

1122
01:22:19,169 --> 01:22:21,933
We're never gonna make it
out of this canyon before they get here.

1123
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,632
I'm parking us beneath the shelf.

1124
01:22:23,707 --> 01:22:27,336
When they use active sonar to find us,
we'll have a better chance of hiding.

1125
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:44,154
Captain, sir,
I've got a fix on a large displacement.

1126
01:22:44,328 --> 01:22:48,765
It's 1,000 yards to our port side, bearing 160.

1127
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:50,997
That's it.

1128
01:22:51,768 --> 01:22:52,996
Galasso.

1129
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:56,667
Can you maneuver that toy of yours
right up to the submarine?

1130
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,903
It's a $5 million piece of equipment, Captain.
It's not a toy.

1131
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:01,705
I need you to run a pattern around the sub.

1132
01:23:01,778 --> 01:23:04,246
If we can get video footage
of the hull and its propellers...

1133
01:23:04,314 --> 01:23:06,111
we can figure out its stealth capability.

1134
01:23:06,183 --> 01:23:08,378
That's not what it was
designed for, Captain.

1135
01:23:09,386 --> 01:23:11,877
This is the grand slam
of intelligence-gathering.

1136
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:13,479
Imagine what the Admiral will say...

1137
01:23:13,557 --> 01:23:17,391
when you bring him information
that can save our entire fleet.

1138
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:56,660
There she is.

1139
01:24:08,812 --> 01:24:11,303
Sonar, Conn.
Keep a track on the Crab's position.

1140
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:13,281
Conn, Sonar. Yes, sir.

1141
01:24:14,851 --> 01:24:16,648
WEPS, are Tubes 1 and 4 ready?

1142
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,711
Breach door on Tube 1 is jammed.

1143
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:20,149
Damn! Get it fixed.

1144
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:30,929
Can you get under the hull?

1145
01:24:31,001 --> 01:24:32,628
It's hard to maneuver.

1146
01:24:32,702 --> 01:24:35,466
She's got 8,000 pounds of wake
pushing me around.

1147
01:24:52,856 --> 01:24:55,051
Those ships have a fix on us.

1148
01:24:55,192 --> 01:24:58,025
Sub's approaching 3,000 yards.
I'm almost at my control limit.

1149
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:00,062
-Stay with her.
-Aye.

1150
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:06,163
Conn, Sonar.
Reporting splashes in the water.

1151
01:25:06,236 --> 01:25:08,227
Depth charges on the way.

1152
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:13,100
WEPS, make Tomahawks ready
in all respects.

1153
01:25:13,176 --> 01:25:17,306
Making Tomahawks ready in all respects.
Targeting Sierra 10 and 1 1.

1154
01:26:05,228 --> 01:26:06,889
She's almost home.

1155
01:26:11,635 --> 01:26:13,967
All stations, report damage to control.

1156
01:26:14,037 --> 01:26:15,664
I'm bringing her back, Captain.

1157
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:18,640
-How long will it take?
-lf everything goes well, a couple minutes.

1158
01:26:23,113 --> 01:26:24,273
Lt. Trifoli.

1159
01:26:25,782 --> 01:26:28,615
Lt. Trifoli, do you still have
the displacement reading?

1160
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:32,018
It's questionable, sir.
I'm getting a lot of interference.

1161
01:26:32,088 --> 01:26:35,216
-Let me just keep trying.
-WEPS, how's that breach door coming?

1162
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:36,725
They're working on it, sir.

1163
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:38,761
I want a firing solution on that sub.

1164
01:26:40,997 --> 01:26:43,898
Conn, Sonar.
Four more depth charges on the way.

1165
01:27:04,688 --> 01:27:07,213
-I can't wait any longer.
-Just give me a little more time.

1166
01:27:57,974 --> 01:28:01,876
It's endgame. WEPS, fire Tomahawks.

1167
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:03,571
Fire Tomahawks.

1168
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:10,481
On their way, bearing 150.

1169
01:28:13,923 --> 01:28:16,255
Estimated time of arrival, 30 seconds.

1170
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:22,827
COB, on my mark.
All ahead full and bring us up to 200 feet.

1171
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:47,956
Conn, Sonar. Direct hit!

1172
01:28:50,193 --> 01:28:53,856
Quiet! Quiet! It's not over! All ahead full.

1173
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:55,363
All ahead full, Captain.

1174
01:28:55,432 --> 01:28:59,664
-Trifoli, do you have a distance for us?
-Yes, sir, 500 yards, starboard side.

1175
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:02,334
Bearing 190.

1176
01:29:02,672 --> 01:29:04,196
Are Tubes 1 and 4 ready?

1177
01:29:04,274 --> 01:29:05,764
Ready in all respects, sir.

1178
01:29:06,176 --> 01:29:07,666
Fire Tubes 1 and 4.

1179
01:29:57,327 --> 01:29:58,385
Yes.

1180
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:14,770
Twenty-one years, Mr. Barker...

1181
01:30:15,912 --> 01:30:20,076
I've trained and prepared for this.
Doesn't make it any easier.

1182
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:22,515
I understand, Captain.

1183
01:30:23,887 --> 01:30:28,119
We did what we had to do.
We laid the hard choice.

1184
01:30:33,029 --> 01:30:36,226
Let's get back to work. XO has the Conn.

1185
01:30:44,141 --> 01:30:46,871
...and such heroes as Cmdr. Frank Habley...

1186
01:30:46,943 --> 01:30:49,605
of the US Navy Pacific Submarine Force.

1187
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,979
The Secretary of the Navy
awarded the Presidential Unit Citation...

1188
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:55,610
for extraordinary heroism,
and outstanding performance of duty...

1189
01:30:56,853 --> 01:31:00,050
during a recent operation
that remains classified.

1190
01:31:02,225 --> 01:31:03,317
Go, Habley!

1191
01:31:03,393 --> 01:31:05,657
-To the Commander.
-Hear, hear.

1192
01:31:17,007 --> 01:31:18,634
Hello, Commander.

1193
01:31:20,877 --> 01:31:22,276
Lt. Trifoli.

1194
01:31:22,746 --> 01:31:23,940
Claire.

1195
01:31:25,849 --> 01:31:29,307
I come up here almost every day.
I really miss him.

1196
01:31:29,386 --> 01:31:31,946
I think about all the times
we could have had together.

1197
01:31:32,022 --> 01:31:33,990
I know. I miss him, too.

1198
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:38,394
I heard you're leaving the Navy, huh?
You're retiring?

1199
01:31:38,528 --> 01:31:39,927
It was time.

1200
01:31:43,033 --> 01:31:44,660
You take care of yourself.

1201
01:31:44,735 --> 01:31:46,100
Commander.

1202
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:47,932
It's just Frank now.

1203
01:31:52,843 --> 01:31:54,208
Goodbye, Frank.

1204
01:31:54,811 --> 01:31:56,005
Claire.

1205
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:03,511
You don't lose that fighting spirit.
We need more people like you.

1206
01:32:03,587 --> 01:32:06,647
You stick to your beliefs.
Make your brother proud.

1207
01:32:12,529 --> 01:32:13,894
Hey, Frank.

1208
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:15,923
Yeah?

1209
01:32:17,467 --> 01:32:20,061
You have time for that cup of coffee?

1210
01:32:20,871 --> 01:32:22,634
Sure, I'd like that.

1211
01:32:29,634 --> 01:32:47,634
THE END
