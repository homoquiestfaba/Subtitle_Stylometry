1
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:17,938
Where do I start?

2
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,578
Its not you.

3
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:29,379
Well, actually, it is you.

4
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,340
Look, Im just not-

5
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:37,221
Im not attracted
to you any more.

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,061
I need space.

7
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:45,061
You kinda-

8
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:49,782
You kinda gross me out.

9
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:56,983
In the beginning, it was different.
In the beginning, you were better.

10
00:00:57,142 --> 00:01:01,423
But then I got to know you
real well, and...

11
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,303
I- I came to realize...

12
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,503
that youre a fat idiot.

13
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:15,584
- I got ya. I got ya. I got ya. I got ya.
- Okay. Okay.

14
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:18,544

- You gotta be straight.

15
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,905
- Okay. - Straight face.
- Okay, okay. - All right.

16
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:27,306
- I want a divorce.
- Why?

17
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:30,187
Its a physical thing.

18
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:35,667
- Physical?
- Ive been experimenting with other men lately.

19
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:39,347
A lot of other men
and women.

20
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:45,748
I dont know. I mean, Antonio can do
this thing with his tongue...

21
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:49,348
and Williams stamina
is amazing.

22
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,229
And as far as hands go,
well, your fathers hands are-

23
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,429
You are no match.
I have no equal.

24
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,630
Get down here.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,750
If the shoe fits

26
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,750
I want you to wear it
and wear it good

27
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,191
Sulkin about them times
when I was by myself

28
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,351
I was always lookin
for somebody else

29
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:23,752
But as time went on
I had a talk with my mind

30
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:27,672
Friends like you and you
I gotta leave behind

31
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:31,913
And Im sayin´ call me a fool
´CCause you only rub it in

33
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:40,714

00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:43,835
And Ill never, ever
depend on you

35
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:49,795
Friends and enemies
around me every day

36
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:54,075
I cant believe
the things they say

37
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:58,316
Takin me for granted
Give me no credit at all

38
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:03,076
Ill just keep bouncin´
like a bouncin´ ball

39
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,997
I dont wanna step
on nobody´ss foot but

40
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:23,679
You call me a fool
but you only rub it in

41
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:26,599
And Ill never see you
if I had known

42
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,639
Ill never see that again

43
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,600
Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,240

00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,608
Oh, thats a trail of chocolate chips.
See, wherever Zippy goes...

61
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,049
he leaves this magical trail of
chocolate for all the boys and girls-

62
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,209
Magical? This- This looks like poop.
It looks like piles of poop.

63
00:04:56,369 --> 00:05:00,209
- It looks like Zippys walking around, ju-
just crapping all over the place. - Stop.

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,610
Zach, lets just say you´rre about to take
a big bite of a juicy chocolate chip cookie?

67
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,931
Whats the last image you want

68
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:14,131
- Excrement?
- Excrement. Right.

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,520

00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:24,765
You had a gun to my head.

00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,686
Look, I told you

182
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,406
You got yourself into this.

183
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:33,047
You know what you are? Youre
a bad person. You´rre an armed robber.

184
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:34,847
Dont expect me

185
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,567

00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:48,169

190
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:50,489
Take a good look.

191
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,009
He could be some
celebrity stalker.

192
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,209

193
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:57,249

Yo, I understand.

220
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,944
Aha!

Thank you.

222
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:41,027
Hey. Oh, shit.

224
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,109
So why are you out here?

225
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:54,669
- What do you care?
- Im curious.

226
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,549
Im a student
of human nature.

227
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,830
Youre a freak
of human nature.

228
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,670
Thats all right.
I forgive you.

229
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,790
Its clear you have
woman problems.

230
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,710
Youre way off base.

231
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,430
- Im off base?
- Yeah. Way off base.

232
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,671
- She mess around on you?
- Look.

233
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:15,271
Even if I wanted to talk about it-
which I dont- it wouldn´tt be with you.

234
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,751
You give her some nastiness? I know you
gave her some serious nastiness.

235
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:22,912
- Just forget it.
- What about him? Did you fuck him up?

236
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:27,633
Did you whoop his ass? I bet you hit
that motherfucker with a bat, didnt ya?

237
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,713
Kling! Pow! Fucked his ass up,
didnt ya?

238
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:34,673
No, wait a minute. You capped him. You
capped that motherfucker, didnt you?

239
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,914
Thats why you out here
in the desert, ain´tt ya?

240
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:40,074
Look. I didnt shoot him. I didn´tt say
anything to my wife. I just left.

241
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:42,035
- What do you mean, you just left?
- Just left. I-

242
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:44,994
I saw them doing you know...

243
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:49,275
and I walked away.

244
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:53,075
What a pussy.

245
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:57,036
No wonder your woman
is sneaking behind your back, man.

246
00:20:57,196 --> 00:21:00,796
Know what your problem is? You dont
have the respect of your woman, man.

247
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:03,196
Thats what it is.
Me, I got all that.

248
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,157
I go home, my dinners
on the table.

249
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,237
Bam! I dont wanna
hear shit, woman.

250
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:11,278
- And if I want lovin- if I´mm in the mood- I get that
too. - You´rre so full of shit. What would you have done?

251
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,678
Man, I would have went back to that house and
Id have pulled a Terminator on the front door.

252
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:18,519
Boom, boom, boom! Who the fuck do you
think youre playin´ with, woman?

253
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,239
Who do you think I am, some fruity pie?
I aint no fruity pie.

254
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,759
Im- I´mm Nick Beam.

255
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,679
Thats what I told her.
I´mm Nick Beam.

256
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,880
And Nick Beam aint puttin´ up
with that bullshit.

257
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,000
Shed have been crying, you know? ´´´OOh,
Nick, oh, Nick, please take me back.

258
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,120
Please, please, Nick.
It was only one time. ´

259
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,001
Im gonna ´´´oone time´´´ your ass.
Nick Beam is the master of his fate...

260
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:41,921
the ruler of his destiny.

261
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:45,761
So if you wanna cry on somebodys
shoulder, why don´tt you cry on Superdick?

262
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,322
As for Nick Beam,
Im fit, lit...

263
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:51,202
and I damn sure
aint takin´ no shit.

264
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:55,922
So you can get the fuck out.

265
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,363
Thats what I woulda
told the bitch.

266
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:03,323
Thats what I
told the bitch.

267
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,364
- What the-
- Hey, hold it. Hold it.

268
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:11,804
Break it up. Break it up.

269
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,165
Should I pay cash, or do you

270
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:45,288
Ah, fu- Oh- Ah-
Oh, shit.

271
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,769

00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,009
- Shit.
- Lets go! Put the money in the fuckin´ bag.

273
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:58,569
Shit.

274
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:00,489
You werent gonna leave

275
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,690
- What do you think youre doing?
- There´ss a special they got goin´ on.

276
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,210
You get a free stack of cash
with every fill-up. Some luck, huh?

277
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,611
How stupid can you be?

278
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,531
- We better get out of here.
- You take that money back.

279
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,492
- Im serious, man. We better get goin´..

I´mm not going anywhere until you return-

281
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,252
Here we go.

282
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,413
- Why? Why? Why?
- I didnt have any money, man.

283
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:38,134
- Oh, you had money.
- No. No. That five dollars I gave the waitress was it.

284
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:42,374
- What the-
- Oh, great. Bufords come to kill us.

285
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:50,416
- Persistent hillbilly motherfucker.
- He has every right to be.

286
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:53,536
You robbed him at gunpoint.
You dick!

287
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:58,576
Hey, hey, youre the one who threw
the wallet out the fuckin´ window.

288
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,977
Smart.

289
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:02,177
Great!

290
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:08,817
Oh, shit.

291
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,578
- All right, man. What you doin?
- Come on, asshole.

292
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,659
Well, would you look

293
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,219
Oh, shit. We gonna die.
Pull off the fuckin road.

294
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,859
Man, would you pull

295
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,500
Oh, shit!

296
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,460
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit.

297
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:55,062
Hey, Earl.

298
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:07,783
Oh, sh-

299
00:25:07,944 --> 00:25:11,704
Im alive! You alive!

300
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,905
Howd you know that hillbilly
was gonna turn first?

301
00:25:14,065 --> 00:25:18,385
You did know he was gonna
turn first, didnt ya?

302
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:21,505
You know what?
It dont even matter.

303
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:24,466
Im alive!
You alive, man!

304
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:38,748
- Get out! -
What? - Get out!

305
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,068
What are you even thinking when
you do something like that?

306
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,789
- You think youre never gonna get caught?
- We didn´tt get caught.

307
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:55,389
Thats not the point.
It´ss beetleheaded.

308
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,430
Its- It´ss only a matter of time
before you do get caught.

309
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,790
- What is beetleheaded?
- Its a synonym for ´´´sstupid. ´´´

310
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,910
Oh. Well, heres a synonym
for ´´´pprocreation. ´´´ Fuck you!

311
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,750
Its easy for you to point the finger when you´rre
sittin´ on your rich ass in a big fuckin´ house.

312
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,551
- Im not rich.
- Oh, yeah.

313
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:15,112
- How bigs your TV?
- What?

314
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:17,351
- I say, how bigs your TV?
- Fifty-inch.

315
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:20,832
- Get in the car.
- Oh, please. Lets not make this a social issue.

316
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:24,472
The point is that even if you wanted to rob
a place, there are smarter ways to do it.

317
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:28,193
- Enlighten me.
- A mask. Wear a mask.

318
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,354
You see, the police
have this thing called a ´llineup... ´´´

319
00:26:30,513 --> 00:26:33,673
and if someone recognizes you,
you go to jail!

320
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,553
Oh, how about this for a novel idea?
Case the place first.

321
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:40,434
Find out if theres a security camera
or a hidden alarm.

322
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:43,235
Then again, why even rob
a convenience store?

323
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,474
How much money could you possibly get?
Two, three hundred dollars?

324
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:47,715
Then what? Youre set
for two days! Wow!

325
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,796
- What do you know, lanky?
- I know you go for the big score.

326
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:52,516
One robbery, youre set.

327
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:55,876
News flash, big slim.

328
00:26:56,036 --> 00:26:57,956
People with big money,
they protect it.

329
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,917
So you do a little research.
Take Quality Design Group where I work.

330
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,436
My boss keeps a ton of cash
in his vault.

331
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:06,597
At night, theres only two guards
and a personal security system.

332
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:09,517
Now, in this case,
I happen to even know the code.

333
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:12,038
But even if I didnt, I-

334
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:17,438
What?

335
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,399
I got a booger in my nose?

336
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,000
What?

337
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,079
Diversify.

338
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,480
You cant trust banks, Nick.

339
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,960
The entire system
could crumble at any second.

340
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,640
That bastards so heavily leveraged,
it would wipe him out.

341
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:43,322
Wait a minute.
Am I hearing you right?

342
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:46,361
Mr ´HHigh and Mighty´´´
is gonna rob his boss?

343
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:52,362
You hear that,
gila monsters?

344
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:55,083
Old Nick Beam here
is gonna rob his boss!

345
00:27:55,203 --> 00:27:59,323
I say, do you hear that,
gila monsters?

346
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:03,243
You know what, Nick? Your wife really
messed your head up bad, man.

347
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:08,804
Youre serious?

348
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:15,405
- How much he got?
- Only the bulk of his personal assets.

349
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:20,565
- Six, seven hundred thousand.
- You what?

350
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:23,726
- Hey, you gonna need some help.
- Oh, no, this has nothing to do with you.

351
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:27,726
Hey, I was present at the time
of creative inspiration...

352
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:30,126
which entitles me
to partial ownership...

353
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:33,566
in this
criminalistic endeavour.

354
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:37,807
- Get out.
- Maybe Ill just call Quality Design Group when we get back.

355
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,207
I want half.

356
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,208
Were gonna bury
this asshole.

357
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,208
Sure, youre right.

358
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,849
If you ever plan

359
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,770
To motor West

360
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,730
Travel my way
Take the highway

361
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,691
Thats the best

362
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,572
Come on
Get your kicks

363
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:15,571
On Route Sixty-

364
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:27,013
Six

365
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,414
Well, it winds from Chicago

366
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,413
To L.A.

367
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,214
More than 2,000 miles

368
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:44,695
- Highway shooters?
- One black, one white. You tell me?

369
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:46,575
You were there,
and they got away?

370
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:50,575
They were driving
a 1996 Yukon.

371
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:56,976
- Licence?
- You know, if I had a licence number, Bart, I wouldnt be standing here...

372
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:59,537
- eating large quantities of shit, now, would I?
- No, sir.

373
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:04,057
Monitor calls on both sides of the border.
Fax that photo to every precinct on the planet.

374
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:08,417
Theres so much as a sneeze
out there I wanna feel the mist.

375
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,059
I hear a voice

376
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:25,460
- Give me all your money and a Yoo Hoo.
- The moneys all locked up.

377
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,620
Thatll be 79 cents, please.

378
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,220
I said
Come on, little prisoner

379
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,940
I got something to say

380
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,262
Something stinks, man.

381
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:54,862
You sure you aint got
a gas leak?

382
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:58,423
- Its my shoes.
- Your shoes?

383
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:03,103
You ever heard of Dr Scholls?

384
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:06,424
I spilled some gas on my shoes
at the gas station.

385
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:09,144
You know,
the one you robbed.

386
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:13,664
- Oh, so you got a camcorder up in here.
- What are you doing?

387
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,225
Im just
checkin´ it out, man.

388
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:17,985
- Pu- Pu- Put it down.
- I aint gonna break it, man.

389
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:21,505
Just let me check it out.
Just let me see.

390
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:24,946
Yo, this is your wife?

391
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:29,346
Man, I see why
you were upset.

392
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:33,067
Not bad, Nick.
Not bad, Nick.

393
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,187
I mean, you know,
for a cheatin bitch.

394
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:37,628
Look, dont you call her that.

395
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,908
You- You dont know her.
Don´tt call her that.

396
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,828
Okay. No disrespect. Okay?

397
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:46,149
What should I call her?

398
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,669
Monogamously challenged?

399
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,669
- God.
- I was just fuckin with you, man.

400
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,750
You know, this is an all right camera
for a regular eight.

401
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:59,510
- Its the best on the market.
- Let me explain something to you, Nick.

402
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,070
If you aint got digital,
you ain´tt got shit.

403
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,471
This has only got
one C.C.D. chip.

404
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,351
Broadcast has three, Nick.

405
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,871
Dont look at me like that.
What, are you surprised I know shit?

406
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,271
The guy that sold me that camera
just set up our computer network.

407
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:19,112
- Windows NT?
- No. Just Windows.

408
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:22,193
- Man, get out of here with that shit.
- Look, heres a nutty idea.

409
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:26,153
If you actually know something about this
stuff, why not use that knowledge and get a job?

410
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:28,153
Take a good look at me.

411
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,033
- Im not exactly the corporate colour.
- That´ss ridiculous.

412
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:34,794
- If you wanted a job, you could have one.
- Theres a spider on your head.

413
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,794
- What?
- Theres a spider on your head.

414
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,315
Look, I am sorry.
I am not up on all this...

415
00:32:40,474 --> 00:32:42,235
jive-talkin, homeboy lingo.

416
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,355
Whats that supposed to mean,
there´ss a spider on your head?

417
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:49,475
It means: Theres a spider on
your motherfuckin´ head, man.

418
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,196
Well, get it off!
Get it off, get it off!

419
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:54,796
- I aint touchin´ that shit.

420
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,716
Get it off, get it off,

421
00:32:56,876 --> 00:33:01,157
- Get it off!
- Yo, thats a big fuckin´ spider, man.

422
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:02,957
Oh, shit!

423
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:11,038
Nick, its just a spider.

424
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,758
Im a scat man

425
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:17,359
No, no.
Now dont go crazy.

426
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:20,519
- Yeah, you go, boy.

427
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,120
Hold on, let me focus.
Let me focus on this shit.

428
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,640
Im a scat man

429
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,840
Oh, shit.

430
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:43,962
You got the hot foot!
Yo, Nick!

431
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,281
Get on the good foot.
Get on the good-

432
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:53,163
Aw, got it!

433
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:11,044

00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:41,368
I gotta make a call.
You pump.

436
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:44,008
- Give me the gun.
- What?

437
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,128
Give me the gun.

438
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,649
Man, I wasnt gonna
rob the place, man.

439
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,649
Then you wont need this.

440
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,569
Then you wont need this.

441
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,610
You must be really fast.

442
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:13,211
Twenty dollars on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

443
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:20,612
- You a cop?
- No.

444
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:23,372
You bastards have tried this

00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,293

446
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,933

Now all I wants $20 on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

459
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:22,539
- Is that too much to ask?
- No, sir.

460
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,300
- Do you mind if I take your gun?
- No, sir.

461
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:28,739
Would you please rip the phone cord
out of the wall?

462
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:32,900
- What?
- Would you rip the phone cord out of the wall, please?

463
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,861
Thank you. This is for the phone and for
the gun and for the sour fruity twist.

464
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:43,621
And $20 on pump number 15. Go on.

465
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:45,702
- Thank you for your patience.
- Yes, sir.

466
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:51,462
Le- Let me get this straight.

467
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:54,343
Its all right for you to rob a place,
but it ain´tt all right for me?

468
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,263
I didnt rob him.

469
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,343
Well, you got a funny way
of not robbin a motherfucker.

470
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:01,863
Nick, lets get out of here,
man, before he calls the cops.

471
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:03,784
- Hes not gonna call the cops.
- How do you know?

472
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:06,704
I had him rip the phone cord
out of the wall.

473
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:09,784
Oh, shoot.
Thats pretty good.

474

00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,910
Oh, man, come on.
This is the shit.

480
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,911
This shit is the shit.
This is the hellified love music.

481
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:09,351
- Im in bad shape over here.
- Ah, man, you know, maybe I can...

482
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:14,151
tune you in to a nice A.M. station
and get you some Donny Osmond.

483
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:20,592
- Charlie, whats this? Slow down.
- Get the fuck out of here.

484
00:38:20,752 --> 00:38:23,152
Pull over and
turn the headlights off.

485
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:37,074
Yo, man, you couldve
gotten me a piece of licorice.

486
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:39,474
- Its sour.
- So.

487
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,714
Still couldve gotten me a piece.

488
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,435
- I didnt think of it.
- Oh, you didn´tt think of it.

489
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,996
Just selfish, man.
Guess thats the world.

490
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:50,516
- You know? You just- You just selfish.
- Here.

491
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,438
Damn.

492
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,958
I swear, white people must got
totally different taste buds, man.

493
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,278
Thats a very
racist thing to say.

494
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,398
Oh, yeah? Good.

495
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,120
What the f-

496
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,280
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa, theyre rammin´ us.

497
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,520
Thanks for the late-breakin news.
Step on the gas, Nick!

498
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,921
I hate new cars.

499
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,041
Whoa!

500
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:45,802
Look at his face, man.

501
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:49,002
Look, man!

502
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,763
Our turf, baby.

503
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:24,166
They dont look like cops.

504
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:26,167
Definitely not cops.

505
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,887
Get out of the car.

506
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:35,488
- There you go.
- All right, motherfuckers, back the fuck off!

507
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:43,448
Oh, shit. Its cool.

508
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:47,888
Oh, yeah, Im cool.

509
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:49,809
I was just fuckin

00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,729
Hey, whats up?
Y´aall-Y´aall live around here?

511
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:55,689
Bring your ass
around the front of the car.

512
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:00,050
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
There you go. There you go.

513
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,891
- All right. Okay. Oh, shit. -
Uh-huh. Watch your feet. - Uh-huh.

514
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:06,851
Come on, rubber legs. Lets go.
Watch where you´rre walkin´..

515
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:09,571
Watch- Watch your feet.
There you go, baby.

516
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:12,091
Perhaps you two havent heard
that my partner and I here...

517
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:15,492
own the rights to all violent crime
on this particular stretch of highway.

518
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:19,612
And we dont take kindly to any
unauthorized criminal activities.

519
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:22,332
You dont understand.
We were-

520
00:41:22,452 --> 00:41:25,173
- Oh, shit.
- Thats my car.

521
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:27,773
- Can I have your attention, please?
- Yeah.

522
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:31,813
I bet you used to sell more Girl Scout cookies
than any other member of the whole troop, didnt ya?

523
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:35,534
What were you calling yourself back
then? Yolanda, you little bitch?

524
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,734
Cynthia? Susan? What was it?
I cant remember.

525
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:40,294
- Hey, guys, I will be gentle. Dont even worry about it.
- Huh?

526
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:43,335
Now- Now, dont even worry.

527
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:45,815
Uh-huh.

528
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,576
I have these.

529
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:51,815
Oh, now thats not
gonna be enough.

530
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,856
Whered you put your booty?

531
00:42:01,857 --> 00:42:07,017
Now Ive done it. I finally found
someone I like less than you.

532
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:10,538
Shit. Thats
a fancy case, friend.

533
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:13,258
You know, when a sweet-mouthed girl
like you has a fancy case like this...

534
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:16,938
a man gets to thinkin
where´ss the wallet?

535
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,139
Thats it.
We´rre dead, man.

536
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:21,979
Im gonna need
that wallet, Alice.

537
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,060
Wheres that big, fat wallet?
Give it to me.

538
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,780
Give me your fuckin wallet,
you little bitch.

539
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,420
- You know what?
- Nick, Nick, what you doin?

540
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:35,661
Im sure you´rre
a really scary guy.

541
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:39,581
Im sure that, normally, people just
quiver at the very sound of your voice.

542
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:43,222
But, you see, I, I cant
see that right now.

543
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:47,462
I- I-I just see a weak,
desperate little man...

544
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:50,343
that probably grew up
torturing little animals.

545
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:52,302
Some puny, little uncoordinated...

546
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:56,743
cant-make-the-football-team- so-I´lll-pick-on-third-graders-
and-steal-their-lunch-money...

547
00:42:56,903 --> 00:42:59,343
punk, jerk-off bully...

548
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:01,663
that one day wakes up
and realizes hes nothing.

549
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:05,784
Just a sad, pathetic, useless,
illiterate piece of inbred shit.

550
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:10,184
I just want you to know,
I totally disagree.

551
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:21,826
- Time to die.
- That just makes you my best friend.

552
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:26,547
All right,
drop the fuckin gun.

553
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:29,547
Drop the fuckin gun!

554
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,467
Give me this, motherfucker.

555
00:43:31,627 --> 00:43:34,347
Now back the fuck up before
I kick you in your bitch-ass chin.

556
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:37,668
Back the fuck up!
I said, back the fuck up!

557
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:40,628
Didnt I say, back the fuck up?
Everybody, back the fuck up.

558
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:43,508
Oh!

559
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:49,469
Shit.

560
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,349
- You shot me.
- Im sorry, Nick.

561
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,589
- Put down the gun.
- Shut up.

562
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:58,230
- You shot me. - I said, Im
sorry, man. I- I-I didn´tt mean it.

563
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,230
The gun just went off.

564
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,631
You know, I have that
same trouble in bed.

565
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:05,830
Well, rarely. Every once
in a great while.

566
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,271
- Put down that gun, you idiot.
- Would you shut up? Im shot here.

567
00:44:09,431 --> 00:44:11,911
You shut the fuck up.
Who the hell do you think you are?

568
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:14,392
- You shut the fuck up! You shut the fuck
up! - Huh? Look at yourself, you candy-ass-

569
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,552
- Man, you shut the fuck up. -
You shut the fuck up. - Shut up!

570
00:44:16,712 --> 00:44:19,992
- Put down the gun! - Hey, hey, hey! - Put that
fucking gun down before you take a fucking toe hit.

571
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:23,433
- You shut the fuck up! - I dont give a shit!
- Shut the fuck up! - Candy-ass motherfucker!

572
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:26,393
- Shut the fuck up, man! - Shut
the fuck up! - Hey, hey, hey!

573
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:29,514
Hey! Everybody,
shut the fuck up!

574
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:31,913
Now, everybody,
shut the fuck up!

575
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:33,754
Especially you.
Shut the fuck up.

576
00:44:33,914 --> 00:44:36,154
You like Girl Scout cookies?
Come here. Come here.

577
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:38,234
You want cookie?
Heres a cookie.

578
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:41,675
Now back the fuck up like I done
told you two dumb-ass mother-

579
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:43,995
Back up, back up.

580
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:51,915
Get in the car, Nick!
Look at you now.

581
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:55,836
Thats good.

582
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,236
Bye, cowboys!

583
00:45:13,398 --> 00:45:16,399
Nick, why the hell you start up
with that guy, man?

584
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,919
- You shot me.
- Im sorry.

585
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,240
- You shot me.
- Im sorry.

586
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,520
You dont say you´rre sorry
when you shoot someone.

587
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,920
You say youre sorry when
you step on someone´ss toe...

588
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,280
or you accidentally
break their glasses...

589
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,440
or you, you fart
while theyre eating.

590
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,161
You- You dont say you´rre sorry
when you shoot someone!

591
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:39,642
Shit.

592
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:43,202
Oh, my God. Its going numb.
It´ss going numb. It´ss going numb.

593
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:46,042
What?

594
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,482
Shit.

595
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:57,723
Oh, my God!

596
00:45:57,884 --> 00:46:00,484
Nick, thats the most
hideous thing I ever seen.

597
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:03,644
Hey, yo, man, you know,
maybe if you wrap your arm in ice...

598
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,364
they can reattach it.

599
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:12,164
Thats funny, man.

600
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:15,885
- Thats a baby gash.
- Shut up.

601
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:19,486
- But its a baby gash.
- It could´vve been a lot worse. It could´vve been a lot worse!

602
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,406
- It couldve been, but it wasn´tt. I´mm
gonna- - What are you thinking, shooting?

603
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:24,326
Look, just calm down,
all right?

604
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:27,927
Youre gonna upset your wound.

605
00:46:48,248 --> 00:46:50,089
Yeah. Do you folks
want a lift somewhere?

606
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:51,930
- Where you from?
- London.

607
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:53,810
- Me too!
- Really?

608
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,450
- Yeah!
- Thats terrific.

609
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,210
Hop in me car. Lets go then.
Come on. Jump in. Let´ss go.

610
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,971
- Oh, this is great.
- Hey, would you scoot over a smidgen?

611
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:08,811
Sorry about that.

613
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:18,813
L.A.

614
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:22,532
City of Angels.

615
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,094
So where you plan
on stayin tonight?

616
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:37,134
- Ill just sleep in the car.
- Yeah, right.

617
00:47:37,294 --> 00:47:40,015
You can stay at my place,
brother.

618
00:47:40,175 --> 00:47:42,735
Thanks.
Well, just for the night.

619
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:44,975
What? Did you think
I was asking you to move in?

620
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:47,616
- No, I was just sayin-
- Please, Mr Beam.

621
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:51,416
- Stay with me forever.
- Just shut up.

622
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:54,736
- Mr Beam.
- Shut up.

623
00:47:54,897 --> 00:47:57,457
- Mr Beam, Mr Beam, Mr Beam.
- You know how to shut up?

624
00:47:57,617 --> 00:47:59,377
- Mr Beam.
- Is it in your vocabulary?

625
00:47:59,537 --> 00:48:01,737
- Stay with me forever, Mr Beam.
- Is it possible? Do you ever shut up?

626
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:04,498
Will you stay with me
forever, Mr Beam?

627
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,620
Look here.
When you meet my wife...

628
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,900
she dont know nothin´
about my sideline gig.

629
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,341
- You mean she doesnt know you´rre a thief?
- Hey, I´mm not a thief, okay?

630
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:37,941
I just dabble
in future used goods.

631
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:41,782
- Well, what does she think you do all day?
- Look for work, man.

632
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:48,582
Maybe if you did look for work,
you wouldnt have to steal.

633
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:50,902
Dont judge me.

634
00:48:58,824 --> 00:49:00,584
You stepped on my shoe.

635
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:02,984

636
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:08,265
Baby, am I glad
to see you.

637
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:11,985
No, no, no. No, talk to me.
Explain this to me now.

638
00:49:12,144 --> 00:49:15,305
I got mugged.

00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:54,910

658
00:50:11,871 --> 00:50:14,672
Now you think on that.

659
00:50:19,312 --> 00:50:22,873

Okay, now you come here.

00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:41,475
Mama didnt have to
smack me three times.

665
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:49,395
- We gotta move out of here.

666
00:50:49,555 --> 00:50:54,476

667
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:58,277
Hey, there, boy. Hey, what

00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:17,719
Hey, you do your homework?

675
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,480

676
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:26,039
- What about you, little miss? Did you do all your homework?

677
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,080
You dont have no homework? All right,

678
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,761
Hut-two-three-four

679
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:39,322
Make your choice cause you got
to grow up to be successful

680
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:42,801
- I hope this isnt an inconvenience for you.
- Not at all.

681
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:47,082
You seem like a nice man. Terrance
can use a few of those in his life.

682
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:49,482
- Good night.
- Good night.

683
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,483
Thanks.

684
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:58,084
Hey.

685
00:53:56,656 --> 00:53:59,857
You know, I never noticed before,
but you got really nice eyes.

686
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,097
- Shut up!
- But you do.

687
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:06,618
Lets get this over with. I can´tt believe it.
I´mm committing armed robbery for two flashlights.

688
00:54:06,778 --> 00:54:09,698
Hey, dont worry about it.
Let´ss go.

689
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Freeze, motherfucker!

690
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,220
You move your ass so much
as an inch, Ill blow it off!

691
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,861
- You hear me, motherfucker?
- Hey. - You hear me? What?

692
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,541
- Why you acting so mean?
- Hey, look, man. Now aint the fuckin´ time, all right?

693
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:43,581
- You say scary shit, it scares em.
- Yeah, but you have a gun.

694
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:46,622
Plus, what youre doing
is a stereotypical robber thing.

695
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:51,703
I mean, its a lot scarier if someone with
a gun is calm and cool and collected, man.

696
00:54:51,863 --> 00:54:54,903
- Thats bullshit, man. Don´tt-
- Here.

697
00:54:55,063 --> 00:54:58,943
Excuse me, sir. Come here.

698
00:54:59,103 --> 00:55:03,104
Come here. Come here.

699
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:08,865
Now, look, Henry...

700
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:11,824
were gonna take
some things outta here...

701
00:55:11,985 --> 00:55:14,985
and youre just gonna
stand there.

702
00:55:17,225 --> 00:55:21,186
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

703
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,347
Good.

704
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:31,467
Now, honestly, which one
did you think was scarier?

705
00:55:33,347 --> 00:55:36,387
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

706
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,908
He was scarier.

707
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:44,149
Really? You didnt find
what he did contrived?

708
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:48,629
- No. It was scary.
- Well, what part?

709
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:52,869
Well, the, uh, ´FFreeze, motherfucker´´´
part was scary.

710
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:56,630
And then he led me to believe
that if I moved my ass...

711
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,271
it, it might be blown off.

712
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:06,591
- You were scary too.
- Oh, come on. Youre just saying that. You don´tt have to lie.

713
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:09,511
No, Im not. I thought
you were very scary.

714
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:11,432
- Really?
- Yeah.

715
00:56:11,592 --> 00:56:14,952
- Well, thank you, Henry.
- Yo, check it out.

716
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:17,513
Theyre flashlights
with A.M./F.M. radio on it.

717
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:21,993
They all that. You can listen to
your music while the lights on, boy.

718
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:24,033
All right, all right!

719
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:27,273
Come on. Come on.

720
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:34,994
Freeze, sucker-bitch!

721
00:56:35,954 --> 00:56:37,795
That was much better.

722
00:56:37,955 --> 00:56:41,435
Thank you, Henry.
See ya later now.

723
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:44,396
What the hell is
´ssucker-bitch´´´??

724
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:05,157
I wanna live in the jungle

725
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:08,438
Where you dont got
to wear no clothes

726
00:57:08,598 --> 00:57:11,318
And they got no boutiques

727
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:13,479
Nothin chic

728
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,518
In the jungle
they dont have no disco

729
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:18,879
Yo, yo, Rig!

730
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,119

00:58:36,968 --> 00:58:39,288
- What- What- What fifteenth?

739
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:41,288
Why cant we just
use the elevator?

740
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:44,529
- Cause there´ss a guard that patrols the building.
- This is bullshit!

741
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,769
Come on, man. Its Saturday night.
They´rre not gonna be there anyway.

742
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:49,809
Look, I know were gonna go

I just wanna check it out.

744
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:56,090
You seriously busted up my party.
You know that.

745
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:58,730
Those girls were attracted to you. I
mean, Christs sake, they´rre only human.

746
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,370
- Youre a handsome man. We will go back.
- I´lll hold you to that.

747
00:59:01,531 --> 00:59:04,171
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm. Whats the matter with you?

748
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:09,851

751
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:24,573
Beat me at what?
Climbing steps?

752
00:59:25,973 --> 00:59:28,574
Guess well call you
the ´´´SStep King. ´´´

753
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:35,974
Oh, shit.

754
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:40,014
No problem.
I know the code.

755
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,296
- What?
- Come on. Come on.

756
00:59:50,056 --> 00:59:54,296
Shit! That asshole
mustve changed the code.

757
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:57,016
Step aside. Let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

758
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:59,097
Okay, let me look.
Mm-hmm.

759
01:00:01,938 --> 01:00:06,258
- What are you gonna do?
- You got 12 possible stations here. Youre only using seven.

760
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:10,178
Im gonna make the other five stations
active, run a test mode...

761
01:00:10,338 --> 01:00:12,578
and force the system
into rotation.

762
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:14,699
What does that mean?

763
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:19,900
We got five minutes.

764
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,141
Here. Put on your mask.

765
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,781
Is that mask sweaty? I think
thats the one I hid behind my balls.

766
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:38,301
All right.

767
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,384

01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:34,114
Hows it feel, Phillip?

784
01:02:34,274 --> 01:02:38,675
You had it all, but it wasnt enough
for you. You had to mess with me.

785
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:43,035
Nobody messes with Nick Beam.

786
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,958
I feel lucky

787
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,719
I just feel that way

788
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,920
Im on a bus to Atlantic City

Later on today

790
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,921
- Your face, man. You showed your face.
- It doesnt matter.

791
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:38,402
It does matter. They catch you,
they catch me. It damn well matters!

792
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,522
- Im a winner
- Hey, man, look at me.

793
01:03:43,682 --> 01:03:46,322
Look at me, man.

Hmm. The alarm

Addressing the groove
I see youre drinkin´ again

803

Youre smokin´ smack inside your

804
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,453
Its a shame

805
01:05:26,614 --> 01:05:29,494
Its a pity in New York City

806
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:32,974
Well

01:05:48,016 --> 01:05:51,016
Well, well, well

Something has changed

809
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:56,136
The way these people think

810
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:10,018
Hey there, lonely girl

811
01:06:10,178 --> 01:06:13,259
Lonely girl

01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,740
- Oh, shit.

814
01:06:34,701 --> 01:06:36,462
White people.

816
01:07:03,344 --> 01:07:05,545
Ohh, shit.

817
01:07:05,704 --> 01:07:07,865
Oh-ho-ho.
Look at this, man!

818
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:12,305
Mama-say, mama-sa, makusa!
Oh, smack me two times!

819
01:07:12,465 --> 01:07:14,265
Calm down.

820
01:07:14,426 --> 01:07:16,866
My son is going
to the best schools.

821
01:07:17,026 --> 01:07:19,746
My daughter, she aint even
gonna know what a food stamp is.

822
01:07:19,906 --> 01:07:23,826
My wife,

823
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:25,787
All the time!

824
01:07:29,507 --> 01:07:32,828
- Whats wrong with you, man?
- Nothing.

825
01:07:32,987 --> 01:07:35,548
You sweatin that bullshit, ain´tt you?
You sweatin´ that bullshit.

826
01:07:35,668 --> 01:07:38,228
You did what you had to do
to that guy, man. Dont worry about it.

827
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:41,028
All right? Put that shit
behind you, man. Where you goin?

828
01:07:41,189 --> 01:07:44,989
Where you goin?
Where you goin´??

829
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:47,309
Im just gonna-
I´mm just gonna take a walk.

830
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:49,229
All right.
Well, hurry back.

831
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:52,150
I got willpower,
but I dont know how much.

832
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,670
You know what Im sayin´??
Yeah.

833
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,950
There is somethin

834
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,710
On your mind

835
01:08:05,671 --> 01:08:10,031
By the way
you look at me

836
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:16,593
There is somethin

837
01:08:16,752 --> 01:08:20,793
On your mind, honey

838
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:27,513
Did you ever do somethin that you
thought would make you feel great?

839
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:29,714
In a weird way,
you almost feel worse.

840
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:32,554
Revenge, huh?
Some things hurt no matter what.

841
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:34,714
That must be a fact
of life.

842
01:08:34,874 --> 01:08:38,314
- And what youre thinkin´
- Hi!

843
01:08:38,475 --> 01:08:41,195
Hi! Nick.

844
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:44,436
I cant believe it.
What are you doin´ here?

845
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:47,635
- Danielle.
- Oops.

846
01:08:47,796 --> 01:08:50,156
I dont know
what I´mm doin´ here.

847
01:08:50,316 --> 01:08:53,036
- What are you doin here?
- Well, Sheila, my best friend-

848
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:56,836
Well, she used to be my best friend. I guess,
technically, Marcy would be my best friend.

849
01:08:56,997 --> 01:08:59,637
I mean, they both think theyre my
best friend, which is okay by me.

850
01:08:59,797 --> 01:09:02,917
But once I did have this nightmare
where Sheila and Marcy are sitting...

851
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:05,838
right next to each other, and this
Eskimo guy comes over and says, ´PPick. ´´´

852
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:10,198
I thought I was gonna die. I mean,
an Eskimo guy. What is that all about?

853
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,598
Anyway, Sheila, shes visiting
and she´ss staying here.

854
01:09:12,758 --> 01:09:14,918
And so I thought Id take her
to a party and show her a good time.

855
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:19,359
And she meets this guy and goes home
with him instead. And, oh, well.

856
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:22,239
You really look good.

857
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,160
You look-
You look good too.

858
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,481
- Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?

859
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,081
Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

860
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:36,721
You know, Im such a klutz. I spilled
beer all over my dress earlier.

861
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:41,482
And, well, I think its stained.
Did it stain, Nick?

862
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:54,923
I have Sheilas room key.
You wanna come up?

863
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:57,524
- Lets get hot
- Oh, yes, it´ss ladies´ night

864
01:09:57,684 --> 01:09:59,844
And the vibes is right

865
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:02,244
Oh, yes, its ladies´ night
Oh, what a night

866
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:04,364
Oh, what a night

867
01:10:04,524 --> 01:10:08,485
Its ladies´ night
and the feeling´ss right

868
01:10:08,645 --> 01:10:11,365
Oh, yes, its ladies´ night
Oh, what a night

869
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:13,445
Oh, what a night

870
01:10:23,006 --> 01:10:25,326
Nick, Nick,
use your key, man.

871
01:10:27,886 --> 01:10:29,647
All right.
All right, Nick. Damn!

872
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:35,408
- Hey, Nick, why couldnt you just use your key?
- Turn your bed down?

873
01:10:49,769 --> 01:10:52,049
Stay.

874
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,772
The lady is lookin good

875
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:16,812
- Just like the lady should
- Just like the lady should

876
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:20,732
Ive been thinking about this
for so long. I want you so bad.

877
01:11:20,893 --> 01:11:22,853
I just wanted to
make her happy.

878
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:25,614
This is gonna be a night
that you wont forget.

879
01:11:25,773 --> 01:11:27,573
I try to forget,
but I cant.

880
01:11:27,733 --> 01:11:31,894
- Give it to me, Nick.
- Give. Thats all I did was give.

881
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:45,216
Nick? Nick, youre really putting
a damper on the mood here.

882
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:47,376
Im sorry.
I don´tt know.

883
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,576
Danielle, I cant.
I just can´tt.

884
01:11:52,216 --> 01:11:55,217
I just wanna make you mine

885
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:58,337
Well be together
till the end of time

886
01:11:58,497 --> 01:12:01,617
Hey, Kareem. Are you aware
that Charlie and I...

887
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:05,017
had intended to come up here
and cap your punk ass?

888
01:12:05,177 --> 01:12:07,018
And your girlfriend Nick.

889
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:10,418
But, shit, you two muffins did such an
outstanding job with this financing...

890
01:12:10,578 --> 01:12:13,658
I mean, who could think about killing
at a time like this?

891
01:12:13,818 --> 01:12:17,179
Thanks. Your approval
means a lot.

892
01:12:17,339 --> 01:12:21,379
- Did I tell you to speak? Did I tell you to speak?
- Charlie, no.

893
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,740
Thats gonna be too loud.

894
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:26,980
Too loud.

895
01:12:55,864 --> 01:12:59,864
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi.

896
01:13:00,023 --> 01:13:03,425
Oh, my God!
Nick, is that you? Are you okay?

897
01:13:04,824 --> 01:13:07,785
- Im fine.
- Oh, thank God!

898
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:09,945
I didnt know if, if you-

899
01:13:10,105 --> 01:13:13,785
I thought that-
Youre not hurt?

900
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:18,545
- No.
- Oh, thank God! Where are you?

901
01:13:18,706 --> 01:13:23,946
Look, Ann, lets not make this harder
than it has to be. I saw you.

902
01:13:24,107 --> 01:13:28,227
- What?
- I saw you. I know.

903
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,627
Saw me what?
What are you talking about?

904
01:13:30,787 --> 01:13:33,468
Come on. Do you have to do this?
You and Phillip.

905
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:35,988
- What about him?
- Youre denying it. She´ss denying it.

906
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:40,828
I dont believe this.
Friday afternoon. Remember?

907
01:13:40,989 --> 01:13:45,669
Well, guess what.
I came home early. I saw you, Ann.

908
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:51,229
- I was there.
- Oh. Oh, no.

909
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,870
Yeah. Oh, no.

910
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:58,831
Nick, I was still
at work Friday afternoon.

911
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:04,031
At work? Well, then your-your clone
was at home screwing my boss.

912
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:07,871
Nick, it was my sister.
Remember, I told you...

913
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:10,592
she was coming next Friday
with her fiance?

914
01:14:10,752 --> 01:14:14,152
Well, I made a mistake. It was this
Friday. They called from the airport.

915
01:14:14,312 --> 01:14:15,952
I told them about
the key in the planter.

916
01:14:16,112 --> 01:14:17,992
I called you, but youd
already left the office.

917
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,513
So I left you a message
on the machine at home.

918
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:24,473
What about
- What about the cuff links? Phillips cuff links were on the sink, Ann.

919
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:27,114
Honey, theyve been in the dresser
since the Christmas party.

920
01:14:27,273 --> 01:14:31,074
I left them on the counter so youd
finally remember to bring them to him.

921
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:33,794
So youre not having
an affair?

922
01:14:33,914 --> 01:14:37,554
- No, you dick!
- You still love me?

923
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:39,875
More than anything in the world.

924
01:14:40,035 --> 01:14:44,315
You- You wouldnt believe
what I´vve been through.

925
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:49,236
Youre gonna laugh,
but I actually- Shit.

926
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:52,197
- Whats the matter? What´ss wrong?
- Shit!

927
01:14:52,357 --> 01:14:55,396
- Whats the matter? What?
- Shit!

928
01:14:55,556 --> 01:14:57,397
Shit! Shit!

929
01:14:57,557 --> 01:14:59,517
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit...

930
01:14:59,677 --> 01:15:01,997
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

931
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,359
Going down.

932
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:21,039
- Dont touch it.
- Oh, man.

933
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,000
Oh, man.

934
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,721
I think I can open the door
and catch the sheet.

935
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:35,761
- Dont touch the sheet, please. Don´tt-
- No, no, no.

936
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:38,761
- No, dont move. Don´tt move.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I done moved the hand.

937
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:42,322
I really dont think you should be moving right now. I
- I think you´rre moving.

938
01:15:42,482 --> 01:15:44,882
- Call the paramedics. Listen to me.
- All right.

939
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:48,202
Get them here
as fast as you can!

940
01:15:48,362 --> 01:15:50,483
Have them meet me
with a gurney.

941
01:15:50,643 --> 01:15:53,203
- Wait. Let me practise.
- Let you practise?

942
01:15:53,323 --> 01:15:56,883
Im hangin´ on
a fuckin´ ledge, man.

943
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:59,723
- I dont wanna die like this, Nick.
- All right.

944
01:15:59,884 --> 01:16:01,884
I wasnt tryin´
to stick you up, man!

Oh! Were rich, man!

01:17:36,095 --> 01:17:38,055
- Okay. What now?

968
01:17:38,214 --> 01:17:40,095
What do you mean, you dont know?
I thought you said you had a plan.

969
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:43,936
- That was my plan: to ram them.
- Ram them.

970
01:17:45,095 --> 01:17:46,656
Speed up!

01:17:48,095 --> 01:17:51,696

- You checkin this shit out?
- Hey, Nick.

983
01:18:54,623 --> 01:18:56,463
I like you like this.

984
01:18:56,624 --> 01:18:58,824
You and your prom date
both having weapons.

985
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,664
That way I dont have to kill
an unarmed couple. It´ss not my style.

986
01:19:02,824 --> 01:19:04,984
Put down the bag.

987
01:19:06,505 --> 01:19:09,705
- Paul Bunyan, come and take the bag.

989
01:19:12,225 --> 01:19:16,626
Who are you? Crime dog now? Are you aware that
theres only two kind of people on the whole planet?

990
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:19,346
There are killers,
and then theres everybody else.

991
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:24,067
Im a killer, Nick. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:19:31,827 --> 01:19:36,068
Oh, you son of a-
Wait, wait, wait.

994
01:19:36,228 --> 01:19:38,789
Oh, shit!

995
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:40,709
What are you,
fuckin out of your mind?

996
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:43,269
- Fuck!
- What, are you crazy?

997
01:19:48,429 --> 01:19:52,109
Huh? Whos in control now?

998
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:54,510
Hand over the bag...

999
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:58,631

1000
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,591
Aint that right, Nick?

1001
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:09,151
- Ill roll over.
- Okay, I see it. I see it.

1002
01:20:09,312 --> 01:20:11,991
Let me try to get around
and get you.

1003
01:20:12,152 --> 01:20:13,792
No, its not-

1004
01:20:15,793 --> 01:20:18,433
- No, theyre in the alley. -
Charlie, it´ss the police. - Oh, yes!

1005
01:20:18,592 --> 01:20:23,153
- Thank God youre here. - Thank God you´rre

1006
01:20:23,313 --> 01:20:25,633
- What the fuck are you doin?
- Put the gun down!

1007
01:20:25,794 --> 01:20:28,154
Put that gun down,
you stupid pig!

1008
01:20:28,313 --> 01:20:30,674
- Wait! Come on!
- Come on, man!

1009
01:20:34,074 --> 01:20:36,714
Its them.

1010
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:41,035
Well, some folks in Arizona are
gonna be mighty happy to see you boys.

1011
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:46,035
Wait, wait, wait! Officer! Officer!
Officer, two other guys-

1012
01:20:49,036 --> 01:20:53,677
´II´mm married. ´´´ Ka-blam!
You´rre too much.

1013
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:55,597
- Is the money all there?
- Looks like it.

1014
01:20:55,756 --> 01:21:00,317
Great. We have just enough time
to get it back.

1015
01:21:00,477 --> 01:21:02,477
Excuse me?

1016
01:21:02,637 --> 01:21:05,678
We have to bring the money back.

1017
01:21:05,838 --> 01:21:07,438
No, no.

1018
01:21:07,598 --> 01:21:10,758
Maybe youre a little bit confused
about the purpose of a robbery.

1019
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:13,998
Oh, T., I didnt tell you. When we
were at the hotel, I called my wife.

1020
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,399
Everythings all right.
You see, it wasn´tt her.

1021
01:21:16,559 --> 01:21:19,679
She wasnt even there.
Isn´tt that great?

1022
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,000
It was her sister
and her sisters fiance.

1023
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:27,760
I dont give a damn if it was
her Uncle Fester and Gumby.

1024
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,480
You aint takin´
this money anywhere, man.

1025
01:21:31,601 --> 01:21:33,601
I dont wanna
hear all that.

1026
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:40,042
- Let go. Let go.
- Gimme the bag. You let go.

1027
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,841
- Let go of the bag. You let-
- Its not your money.

1028
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:43,362
- Its not your money.
- It´ss not your money!

1029
01:21:43,522 --> 01:21:45,123
- Its not yours. It´ss half mine.
- Let go!

1030
01:21:45,282 --> 01:21:46,802
- You let go! - Let
go! - You let go!

1031
01:21:46,962 --> 01:21:48,803
Let go!

1032
01:21:56,604 --> 01:21:58,723
Get back here!

1033
01:22:17,645 --> 01:22:20,446
- You okay?
- Yeah, Im okay.

1034
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:23,767
- And you?
- Ill live.

1035
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:29,127
Cant let you take
the money, Nick.

1036
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:31,927
T., my life is in that bag.

1037
01:22:32,087 --> 01:22:37,128
Nick, even if you wanted
to take the money back, you cant.

1038
01:22:37,288 --> 01:22:41,128
- Your face is on the video, man.
- They only review the tapes if somethings missing.

1039
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:44,569
I can go into work early
and bring it back. No onell know.

1040
01:22:48,569 --> 01:22:50,329
T.

1041
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,570
I can get my life back.

1042
01:23:11,092 --> 01:23:16,092
You forget one thing, Nick.
I get my life back too.

1043
01:23:48,776 --> 01:23:51,457
Money dont make
my world go ´rround

1044
01:23:53,536 --> 01:23:56,416
Im reaching out
for the higher ground

1045
01:23:58,657 --> 01:24:02,418
To a warm and peaceful place

1046
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:07,138
I can rest my weary face

1047
01:24:08,698 --> 01:24:10,858
Lifes answers we try to find

1048
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:13,578
Oh, we try to find
Yes, we try to find

1049
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:17,019
Battling inside our minds

1050
01:24:18,579 --> 01:24:23,420
Where do I go from here

1051
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:27,900
Will all my friends be there

1052
01:24:28,061 --> 01:24:30,941
Cause we´rre living
we´rre living

1053
01:24:31,101 --> 01:24:33,101
In a crazy maze

1054
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:36,022
And were fighting
we´rre fighting

1055
01:24:36,182 --> 01:24:37,501
To rise above the haze

1056
01:24:37,662 --> 01:24:40,741
Lights at the end
of the tunnel

1057
01:24:40,902 --> 01:24:43,502
Sometimes the journeys long

1058
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:46,023
There are many theories

1059
01:24:46,183 --> 01:24:49,343
Whos right and who´ss wrong

1060
01:24:51,023 --> 01:24:54,503
Pressures on
I have to choose

1061
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:59,264
Ive got nothing to lose

1062
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:04,864
I close my eyes
I take a chance

1063
01:25:05,024 --> 01:25:09,225
I- I, I now dance
a different dance

1064
01:25:11,265 --> 01:25:13,346
Whats the key
to a happy life

1065
01:25:13,505 --> 01:25:15,946
Tell me now, now, now

1066
01:25:16,106 --> 01:25:19,026
Healthy mind
and lots of spice

1067
01:25:21,226 --> 01:25:24,547
Running barefoot
through the trees

1068
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:27,827
- Oh, my God!
- Thats my idea of free

1069
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:30,547
Ow. Ouch.

1070
01:25:30,707 --> 01:25:33,267
What happened to you?

1071
01:25:33,388 --> 01:25:35,668
Its a long story.

1072
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:38,068
- I got shot.
- What?

1073
01:25:38,228 --> 01:25:40,789
And I- I think
Im wanted in Arizona.

1074
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:44,989
Plus, my shoes
caught on fire.

1075
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:52,790
You told me you were selling me the top of
the line. The top of the line is digital.

1076
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,310
Did you sell me a digital?
No, you did not.

1077
01:25:55,471 --> 01:25:57,310
So, Im bringing it back,
and I expect a full refund.

1078
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,311
And if you do not give me
a full refund, you will not...

1079
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,631
be doing business
with myself or my company.

1080
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:03,591
Thank you.

1081
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:09,631
- So, did you hear?
- What?

1082
01:26:09,792 --> 01:26:12,192
Some, uh, vandals
broke in over the weekend.

1083
01:26:12,352 --> 01:26:16,313
- What? - Well, nothing was
stolen. They- They cut the-

1084
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:18,513
the thingy...

1085
01:26:18,672 --> 01:26:22,033
off P.B.s statue.

1086
01:26:24,794 --> 01:26:28,153
Um, theyre reviewing
the videotape.

1087
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:37,955
- Hi, everybody. Hows it going?
- Not now, Nick.

1088
01:26:40,355 --> 01:26:42,995
- Did anybody see that game last night?
- Game? What game?

1089
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:46,036
- Oh, that game. Overtime.
- Will you please shut up!

1090
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:52,957
Dont touch it. Don´tt touch it.
Oh, you pig. Oh, you pig.

1091
01:26:58,757 --> 01:27:00,638
Well, thats it.
What´ss done is done. Listen.

1092
01:27:00,797 --> 01:27:02,638
Ive got this great idea for
the new McGinty Cracker mascot.

1093
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:04,878
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Thank you. - This mascot-

1094
01:27:05,037 --> 01:27:07,318
- This-
- Nick! Shut up!

1095
01:27:12,799 --> 01:27:15,359
Whats happening?

1096
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:20,640
Well, what is this?
What the hell is this?

1097
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,600
- I dont know.
- You goin´ crazy as a spider!

1098
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,000
Somebody mustve recorded
over the tape.

1099
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:31,481
- Who had access?
- Uh, there was an electrician in here this morning.

1100
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:34,041
What electrician?
I did not order an electrician!

1101
01:27:34,201 --> 01:27:38,602
I did. The flickers on the-
Fluorescent lights were flickering.

1102
01:27:38,762 --> 01:27:41,082
- Im really sorry, sir.
- This is terrible, Phil.

1103
01:27:41,242 --> 01:27:42,762
- I would really like to be alone
now. - Ill go now. - You should go.

1104
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:45,002
- I would be really like to be alone. - You
should go. - Ill leave now. - You should go too.

1105
01:27:45,162 --> 01:27:47,842
- I would like to be extremely alone for a minute.
- Im gonna leave you alone.

1106
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:50,763
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Nick.

1107
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:57,843
All right now. Cut that out.
Yall wanna eat? You wanna eat?

1108
01:27:58,003 --> 01:28:00,004
- Yeah, we wanna eat.
- I thought you wanna eat. You wanna eat? All right.

1109
01:28:00,164 --> 01:28:02,324
- Just dont burn the meat.
- I don´tt never burn the meat.

1110
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:05,245
- Uh-huh. What happened the last time?
- Hey, Dad dont burn the meat.

1111
01:28:05,404 --> 01:28:08,405
- Im gonna put some more po-po sauce

1112
01:28:08,565 --> 01:28:12,045
- Yeah, thats-
- Go see your mama, boy. You know.

1113
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:15,005
Now this is my very
special mustard.

1114
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,406
- Dont let nobody touch that.
- Okay, Mama.

1115
01:28:17,566 --> 01:28:20,126
- All right.
- Yeah.

1116
01:28:20,286 --> 01:28:22,767
So, hows the
electrician business?

1117
01:28:24,206 --> 01:28:28,527
Hey. Not bad.
The hours are a bitch.

1118
01:28:29,648 --> 01:28:31,487
I wanna thank you.

1119
01:28:31,647 --> 01:28:36,168
I dont know why- I just wanna say
I appreciate what you did.

1120
01:28:38,128 --> 01:28:41,409
Well, dont mention it. How´ss that?
How did you know where I was anyway?

1121
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:45,089
A friend gave me a tip.

1122
01:28:46,849 --> 01:28:49,209
A friend, huh?

1123
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:52,130
- You hungry?
- Yes, we would love for you to join us.

1124
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:54,290
Wouldnt we, Mama?

1125
01:28:58,051 --> 01:29:00,731
I talked to my boss today
after things settled down.

1126
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:05,251
Convinced him we need
a new security system. Got any ideas?

1127
01:29:05,411 --> 01:29:07,811
Sure. I can help you
pick one out.

1128
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:11,172
You wanna run it?
We need someone trustworthy.

1129
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:13,973
I told him I know
just the guy.

1130
01:29:14,132 --> 01:29:15,812
Well, Im gonna have to
think about this, Nick.

1131
01:29:15,973 --> 01:29:20,093
Right now, Im weighing out several
lucrative offers. I mean, they rollin´ in.

1132
01:29:20,253 --> 01:29:22,533
A lot of people want me
to work for them right now.

1133
01:29:22,693 --> 01:29:25,774
Now, thats just
the way I like it.

1134
01:29:25,933 --> 01:29:29,014
All I need now is some
of Mamas special mustard.

1135
01:29:29,174 --> 01:29:30,975
Stop.

1136
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:39,975
Whatd I do?

1137
01:29:50,536 --> 01:29:54,257
- Run, run!
- Stay down, Nick. Get on outta here.

1138
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:57,458
Ill beat you into the-

1139
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:02,218
See you when you get there

1140
01:30:12,939 --> 01:30:16,299
Now I seen places and faces of things
you aint never thought about thinkin´

1141
01:30:16,459 --> 01:30:18,860
If you aint peeked then you
must be drinkin´ and smokin´

1142
01:30:19,019 --> 01:30:22,340
Pretendin that you´rre locin´
but you´rre broken, let me get you open

1143
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,220
Now, little Timmy got his diploma
and little Jimmy got life

1144
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,021
And Tamica around the corner
just took her first hit off the pipe

1145
01:30:28,181 --> 01:30:30,741
The other homey shot the other homey
and ran off with his money

1146
01:30:30,861 --> 01:30:33,341
And when the other homeys heard about it
they thought that it was funny

1147
01:30:33,501 --> 01:30:35,821
But whos the dummy ´ccause now
you done lost a hustler

1148
01:30:35,982 --> 01:30:38,262
A down-ass brother
done replaced by a bustler

1149
01:30:38,422 --> 01:30:40,622
And though I got love for ya
I know I cant trust ya

1150
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,342
Cause my crew is rollin´ numbers
and your crew is rollin´ dusters

1151
01:30:43,502 --> 01:30:46,222
And just because of that you act
like you dont like a brother no more

1152
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:48,502
I guess thats just
the way you go

1153
01:30:48,663 --> 01:30:52,263
I aint tryin´ to preach, I believe
I can reach but your mind ain´tt prepared

1154
01:30:52,423 --> 01:30:54,183
I see ya when you get there

1155
01:30:54,344 --> 01:30:57,823
Ill see you
when you get there

1156
01:30:57,984 --> 01:31:00,624
If you ever get there

1157
01:31:00,784 --> 01:31:03,705
See you when you get there

1158
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:08,265
Ill see you
when you get there

1159
01:31:08,425 --> 01:31:10,706
If you ever get there

1160
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:13,866
See you when you get there

1161
01:31:14,025 --> 01:31:16,186
More temptation and fate
I guess we livin for today

1162
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:19,026
I seen a man get swept off his feet
by a bull with an AK

1163
01:31:19,186 --> 01:31:21,426
The situations so twisted
everybody gettin´ lifted

1164
01:31:21,586 --> 01:31:24,306
Im just tryin´ to take care
of my kids and handle my business

1165
01:31:24,467 --> 01:31:26,787
Cause it´ss way too serious
so you gotta pay close attention

1166
01:31:26,947 --> 01:31:29,348
So you dont get caught slippin´
when they come to do all the gettin´

1167
01:31:29,508 --> 01:31:31,668
Life is a big game so you gotta
play it with the big boys

1168
01:31:31,828 --> 01:31:34,228
Some of us gotta run a little faster
cause we gotta lay the straw

1169
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:37,108
But Id be a fool to surrender
when I know I can be a contender

1170
01:31:37,268 --> 01:31:39,629
If everybodys ascended
then everybody can be a winner

1171
01:31:39,789 --> 01:31:41,909
No matter your rag color
Deep down we all brothers

1172
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:44,549
And we gonna set a time
Somebody up there still love us

1173
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:47,190
Im gonna scuffle and struggle with ya
I´mm breathless and weak

1174
01:31:47,349 --> 01:31:49,790
I done strived my whole life
to make it to the mountain peak

1175
01:31:49,949 --> 01:31:52,270
Always keep reachin
Sure to grab onto somethin´

1176
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:55,270
Ill be there when you get there
waitin´ with the sounds bumpin´

1177
01:31:55,431 --> 01:31:59,590
Ill see you
when you get there

1178
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:01,871
If you ever get there

1179
01:32:02,031 --> 01:32:05,111
See you when you get there

1180
01:32:05,272 --> 01:32:09,711
Ill see you
when you get there

1181
01:32:09,872 --> 01:32:12,232
If you ever get there

1182
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:15,433
See you when
you get there

1183
01:32:15,593 --> 01:32:18,513
As we walk down the road
of our destiny

1184
01:32:18,673 --> 01:32:21,233
And the time comes to choose
which shall it be

1185
01:32:21,354 --> 01:32:23,233
The wide and crooked
or the straight and narrow

1186
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:26,193
We got one voice to give
and one life to live

1187
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:28,994
Stand up for somethin
or lay down in the game

1188
01:32:29,154 --> 01:32:31,434
Listen to the song
that we sing

1189
01:32:31,594 --> 01:32:33,434
Its up to you
to make your beef

1190
01:32:33,594 --> 01:32:36,155
I guess Ill see you
when you see me

1191
01:32:36,315 --> 01:32:40,156
Ill see you

1192
01:32:40,315 --> 01:32:43,075
When you get there

1193
01:32:43,236 --> 01:32:46,036
If you wanna get there

1194
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:50,476
- Ill see you
- I´lll see you

1195
01:32:50,636 --> 01:32:53,677
- When you get there
- When you get there

1196
01:32:53,837 --> 01:32:56,477
- If you wanna get there
- If you really

1197
01:32:56,637 --> 01:33:00,718
- Ill see you
- I´lll see you

1198
01:33:00,877 --> 01:33:04,158
- When you get there
- When you get there

1199
01:33:04,318 --> 01:33:06,718
- If you wanna get there
- If you really

1200
01:33:06,878 --> 01:33:10,839
Ill see you

1201
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:12,879
When you get there
