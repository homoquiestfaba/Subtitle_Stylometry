1
00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:01,802
- [Voiceover] It's a thin
line that exists between

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:05,034
enjoying a romantic candlelit
dinner with a woman you love

3
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:06,518
and getting your head
smashed in with a broken

4
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:08,768
whiskey bottle by her husband.

5
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:11,635
I've lived my life on this
line for 15 years now.

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,437
It wasn't always that way though.

7
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:15,496
Sure I was a National Merit Scholar,

8
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:17,181
lauded member of the Honor Society,

9
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,762
and somewhat of a ladies' man.

10
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,245
I was born with the right stuff,

11
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:22,909
hardy Irish stock on my father's side

12
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,966
and the passionate Italian blood

13
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:26,462
of a trained killer on my mother's.

14
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,638
I'm the last of a dying
breed of men though,

15
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:30,590
men who had it and let it go

16
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,844
back into the ocean just to see

17
00:00:31,844 --> 00:00:33,753
if they could catch it again.

18
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:38,377
That's why I decided to
slow things down a bit,

19
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,329
pursue better health and nutrition.

20
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,833
I've been eating better, sleeping better,

21
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,037
and I've never felt better.

22
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,466
So pay no attention to
those insidious rumors

23
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,418
started by Marcus Drummond about

24
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,466
some mental meltdown I suffered.

25
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,607
They're simply not true.

26
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:57,269
(acoustic guitar plays)

27
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:01,668
(soft rumba music)

28
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,910
- Scouring the want ads, eh, Gordo?

29
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,573
Not satisfied with your
bartending position here?

30
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:10,461
- No, it's just that I'm trying to, um,

31
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,095
broaden my horizons.

32
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,705
New experiences.

33
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:16,039
- Well, good luck, my friend.

34
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,859
- Thanks Ruben, you know,

35
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:21,189
I haven't seen you so merry in some time.

36
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,950
- Big date tonight.

37
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,092
Stephanie.

38
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,521
- Stefania?

39
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,612
But she doesn't even know you exist.

40
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:29,159
- Ning.

41
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,918
- At your service, Captain.

42
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:34,351
- To the contrary, Ning,
she very well knows I exist.

43
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,887
- That's right, Ning,

44
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,202
although you'd be a lot
better off if she didn't.

45
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:40,442
- I can't imagine why
that would be the case.

46
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:44,463
I mean look at this chiseled physique.

47
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:45,967
- Impressive.

48
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:48,367
So how did you get her to agree on a date?

49
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,639
- It's not so much of a
date as it is my knowing

50
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,228
where she's going to be tonight.

51
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:54,247
- Here's one to fuel your fire.

52
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,422
I call this one

53
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:57,969
Jean Bonet.

54
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,366
- Thanks for the concern ol' friend,

55
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,719
but I'm going for a 20-mile run.

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,115
Come party time

57
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:07,231
my body will be toned,
my mind'll be sharp,

58
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:09,161
and I'm gonna be so primed for love,

59
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,187
I'm gonna strum fuckin' Arpeggios

60
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:13,182
on this girl's heart strings.

61
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,824
- Good plan.

62
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:17,970
- Ruben, that's extremely dangerous.

63
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,379
I feel I should chaperone you.

64
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,448
- Not today, Ning.

65
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:24,099
My methods are time-tested

66
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,049
and this tiger roams solo.

67
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:30,400
♫ Gimme love like ya
really, really mean it

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,981
♫ Let's do away with the ol' touch-and-go

69
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:35,882
♫ I wasn't lookin' for
this dream to believe in

70
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,565
♫ But now it's here, so where do we go

71
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,307
♫ And you should know that
your heart is deservin'

72
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:44,295
♫ I brought my guts to
this party we can share

73
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:47,168
♫ A lot of times that
were pretty unnervin'

74
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,277
♫ Were those times where
you don't seem to care

75
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,568
♫ So if you stop

76
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,146
♫ Will I be standing there

77
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:59,146
♫ Whoa oh oh oh

78
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:01,187
♫ But don't stop, don't stop for me

79
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:03,520
♫ I said don't stop ♫

80
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:11,374
(giggling)

81
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,347
- Marcus Drummond.

82
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:21,333
Any time, villian.

83
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,253
- Looking rather

84
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,486
moist tonight.

85
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:26,538
It's a good look.

86
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,114
- Out of my way.

87
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:30,984
I've an appointment with
destiny and shall not tarry.

88
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,075
Where is my beloved?

89
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,495
- (snickers) You mean Stefania?

90
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,195
She's right yonder, my good squire.

91
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:41,602
I shall not be the one to
keep you from your destiny.

92
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,698
- Fuck head, I thought we told you

93
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,543
never to come back here again.

94
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,109
- Oh my god.

95
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:50,985
It's that weird guy

96
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:53,032
Weird fixings bar.

97
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,802
Do not leave me here alone.

98
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,063
- You, sir, are an imbecile,

99
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,579
and I shall not have words with you.

100
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,109
- Poor wayward soul, hmph.

101
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,157
- Good evening to you ladies.

102
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,738
Destiny has arrived in the form of a man.

103
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,062
- Ruben, I have a very jealous boyfriend.

104
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:11,774
- Jealous of your beauty I imagine.

105
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:14,185
- And he's a mixed martial artist.

106
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:14,813
- Stephanie.

107
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,105
- It's Stefania.

108
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:19,497
- Stefanunia, I implore you

109
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:21,107
look into these eyes,

110
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,519
these eyes that adore you.

111
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,607
And take what I offer
you which is everything

112
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:30,235
and as we share from the same cup.

113
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:32,839
- Okay.

114
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:35,670
- Hey baby.

115
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,217
Want me to cut this douche loose?

116
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:38,956
- No Howie, everything's fine here.

117
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,983
- What the fuck were you thinking man?

118
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:44,439
- You, sir, made your last gesture

119
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,926
and I demand satisfaction.

120
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:49,694
You and me, right now, let's go.

121
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,172
- Oh my God!

122
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:53,123
Ruben, are you okay?

123
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:53,806
- Come on baby.

124
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,345
- You're a retard Howie

125
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:59,440
and quit all your
dumbass (mumbling) class.

126
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,250
(llaughing)

127
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,263
- Ning!

128
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,071
Excellent job, Ning.

129
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:14,175
Think I can feel the vertebrae
fusing together again.

130
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:18,057
- Ruben, I think you
made a great impression.

131
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,879
- Well, a small price to pay for success.

132
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,503
Anyway, I'm glad you had
this neck corset handy.

133
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:25,680
- Actually, that was my
grandmother's cervical collar.

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,036
She wore it during her neck reduction.

135
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,112
- Goiter?

136
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,959
- Her neck was too spacious, Ning!

137
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,036
- I can only imagine.

138
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,170
- Listen to me.
- [Ruben] Gentlemen!

139
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,537
While I was victorious in
the fickle ways of love,

140
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,516
I've concluded that Marcus
Drummond must be dealt with

141
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:43,058
forthwith to determine which
of us is the better man.

142
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:45,382
- A gentlemen off.

143
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:46,285
- Precisely.

144
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,874
- Ruben, I feel this
will be very dangerous.

145
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,982
- Oh it will be Ning.

146
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,365
I'll make sure of that.
