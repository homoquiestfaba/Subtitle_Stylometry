1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,153
(dramatic music)
- Monster Brawl!

2
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:06,060
- I've got something you want.
- Feel bad for the guy?

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,700
- Sometimes the world's
not so black and white.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,473
- Can we--
- You do it.

5
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:13,565
This is not over.
(woman screams)

6
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:17,935
- It appears as if someone let her go.
(man screams)

7
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:22,940
I think we should put on a special show,

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,613
just for the employees.
(sobbing)

9
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:34,635
(eerie music)

10
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:41,727
(clattering)
(chain rattles)

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,993
(grunts)

12
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:04,489
(light pop music)

13
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,739
- My beloved staff members.

14
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:13,989
I always tell you that you
can't change your thoughts

15
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:18,951
until you first change your attitude!

16
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,284
- Let me go, Micah!
- A liar!

17
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:24,155
A thief!

18
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:27,262
A cheat!

19
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,672
A traitor!

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,937
Monster Brawl's very own Porter Harris!

21
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,209
(growling)
(footsteps thumping)

22
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:41,126
And on the other end, you know him,

23
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:47,743
you love him.
(Colossus growling)

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,620
(electricity crackling)
(Colossus groaning)

25
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:56,075
Let's brawl!

26
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:02,676
(exciting music)
(Colossus growling)

27
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,320
- Please, please!

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,883
I'll get the collar off.

29
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:07,483
I know she's hurting you.

30
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,262
Just let me get that.

31
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:15,263
(electricity crackling)
(Colossus groaning)

32
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:20,835
Please, please!

33
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:23,567
(electricity crackling)

34
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,400
- Hey!

35
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:31,214
(Colossus growls)
(Micah yells)

36
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:36,214
(electricity crackles)
(Porter yelling)

37
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,791
- Please!

38
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,124
He's hurting me!

39
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,934
- Remember me?
- Erica!

40
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,696
- You traitor!

41
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:50,946
Go get him!

42
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,424
(Colossus growls)

43
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,257
No, no!

44
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:57,489
- Come on, let's get out of here!

45
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,822
- Look, she owes us our pay!

46
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,820
- You can't spend money if you're dead.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,620
- I thought you were tough.

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,820
- I'm also not an idiot.

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,693
Good luck.
- Come on!

50
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:21,010
- Back for more?
- Mars, come on.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,576
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Mars!

52
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:26,655
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

53
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:27,655
Here, kitty!

54
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,180
- Please, please!

55
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,557
(body thuds)

56
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:41,174
(Colossus growling)

57
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:43,674
(tense music)

58
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,783
Give me my pay, Micah!

59
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:07,170
- I didn't know you
were such a mama's boy.

60
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,460
Makes sense, a little baby like you.

61
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,190
You let me down, Porter.

62
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,390
You're weak!
(Porter yells)

63
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,090
- Erica's pay too.

64
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,339
(slurping)

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,350
- You know what I put in
one of these bad boys, huh?

66
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,744
A little kale, some avocado,

67
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:30,087
and some of my secret juice.
Just one tiny drop a day and...

68
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,183
Oh, honey!

69
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,143
You want your pay?

70
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:41,143
Come get it!

71
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:45,398
I dare you!
(Porter yelling)

72
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:48,148
(dramatic music)

73
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,462
Pathetic little mama's boy!

74
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:55,096
- I'm changing my attitude, Micah.

75
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:57,746
It's you I hate!
(Micah laughs evilly)

76
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,953
And everything you stand for,

77
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:02,852
you vindictive, selfish bag!

78
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:06,054
(Micah yells)

79
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,887
(Micah screaming)

80
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm done watching the
innocent take the fall

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,975
while the wicked walk free.

82
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:25,897
Let's show world what a
monster you really are!

83
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:34,404
- Porter!

84
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,338
Oh, thought you might need some help.

85
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,533
Come on, let's go!

86
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:50,850
(Colossus growls)

87
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,600
I definitely mentioned I'm sorry

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,020
for taking you captive and making
you fight to the death, right?

89
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,409
(Erica yelps)
- Wait, stop, stop!

90
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:03,476
You were a dad once, a
great one from what I know.

91
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:07,150
(Colossus growls)
People call you a monster?

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,973
I lost my mom to murderers,

93
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,290
people like this, people like Micah.

94
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,098
They're the real monsters.

95
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:15,780
Look, if you walk out that gate,
the city will hunt you down and kill you.

96
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:21,185
If you come with me, I
can give you your freedom.

97
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:25,176
Look, you can be free.
(electricity crackling)

98
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,457
You can be free.

99
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:29,290
(Colossus growls)

100
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:35,378
(tense music)

101
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,119
- So where are you headed?

102
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,253
- Take care of some unfinished business.

103
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:46,382
- Oh?

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,649
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to pay me back.

105
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,960
I don't have a job.

106
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,210
- I literally just saved your life.

107
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,110
- Yeah, which wouldn't have
had to happen if you didn't...

108
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,633
You think that makes us even?

109
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,293
That nasty ass kiss?

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,283
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.

111
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,213
- Gladly.

112
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,562
(light music)

113
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,701
(Colossus growling)

114
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,395
(dramatic music)

115
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,689
(Colossus growls)

116
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,687
- Excuse me.

117
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,272
Hey, excuse me.

118
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:38,939
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I think I got it.

119
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:43,817
- Hey!

120
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,234
This yours?
- Oh, gee, thanks.

121
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:51,023
My head's in the clouds today.

122
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,013
(tense music)
