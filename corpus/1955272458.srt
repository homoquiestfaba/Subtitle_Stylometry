00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,036
                First time here?

6
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,471
        Me?                     

7
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,773
No, I used to live here.        

8
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,775
For almost ten years.           

9
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,877
                   And you left?

10
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,213
        Yup.                    

11
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,616
        So what brings you back?

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,818
I'm here for a wedding.         

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,152
                      Yours?

       (chuckles)               

15
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,489
         No.                    

16
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,826
       So is it good to be back?

17
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,131
Ask me in a couple of days.     

18
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,466
               Fair enough.

Look who's ambled into town.    

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,151
      Hey, boys.                
I can't... I love               
that you're late.               

28
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,452
I don't think                   
you've ever been late.          

29
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,321
      Maybe I'm finally         
      becoming fashionable.     

30
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,089
     I love your beard. Hey.    
    Hey.                        

31
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,758
I told you nine months          
is all it takes                 

32
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:07,958
to make a new man               
out of him.                     

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,727
   Stop it, stop it.            
No, it needs more lift!         

34
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,362
          So masculine.         
  I can't believe we came here. 

35
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,765
 How long has it been           
since we've been here?          
Uh, my 23rd birthday.           

36
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,899
I had sex with the waiter,      

37
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,634
and you threw up                
in that toilet over there.      

38
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,702
      Oh, good times.           

39
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,804
       Fuck, it is so good      
       to see you guys.         

40
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,372
                       You too. 

41
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,973
I'm sorry I've been             
so bad lately.                  

42
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,642
It's just that work has         
been super hectic,              

43
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,077
and it doesn't help that        
I deactivated my Facebook.      

44
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,079
But that's not an excuse.       

45
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,782
            Don't worry.        
            It's all going fine.

46
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,149
                     Fine?      

47
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,118
         Last Tuesday, there was
         a line all the way     
         down the block.        

48
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,853
That's amazing.                 
   It's getting there.          

49
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,888
      And he promised me tonight

50
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,224
      he wouldn't check         
      the window, not even once.

51
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,293
        Maybe just once.        
              No. No, you swore.

52
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,761
           Not even             
           a fuckin' text, okay?

53
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,262
          Okay. Jesus.          

54
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,997
How's the Art Institute?        

55
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,800
               Oh, these punk   
               art school brats,

56
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,435
            they have no respect
            for the equipment,  

57
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,603
            but I can almost pay
            rent now,           

58
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,740
           so, that's something.
Oh! Almost.                     

59
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,308
My balls are here.              
                          Mm!   

60
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,776
Wait, so what is                
the plan for tonight?           

61
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,944
What's going on?                
          Oh...                 

62
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,648
      First up is Li Po         
      for Chinese Mai Tais.     
What?                           

63
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,316
We haven't been there           
in a million years.             
                      I know.   

64
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,352
       Doris and Malik are      
      gonna meet us there.      
Oh, nice.                       

65
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,886
How are they?                   
     They're good, I think.     

66
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,555
    He hasn't thrown her out,   
    so that's something.        

67
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,657
    They went to Hawaii         
    recently, I know that.      

68
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,359
                Richie and Brady
                 are coming too.

69
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,593
  What?                         

70
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,895
You invited them?               

71
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,597
No, I'm kidding.                
           (laughter)           

72
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,931
Don't worry, seriously.         

73
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,933
I think, actually, it's         
gonna be nice to see them,      

74
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,101
both of them.                   

75
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,737
In fact, I actually made        
a pact with myself,             

76
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,405
on the plane,                   
that I was gonna try            

77
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,106
and make a real effort          
with Brady.                     

78
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,509
    Well, that's good,          
    'cause he's pretty cool.    
            When he's not drunk.

79
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,110
                    Just sayin'.

80
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,346
                 Yeah.          
Wait a second.                  

81
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,183
we gotta raise a glass.         
               Mm.              

82
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,919
To the new,                     
grown-up Agustín.               

83
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,254
Actually,                       
to all of us, really,           

84
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,691
for finally finding something   
close to adulthood, right?      

85
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,092
                Close to it.    
          Close, yeah.          

86
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,127
           Both: Yeah.          
It took us long enough,         
that's for sure.                

87
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,696
      Cheers.                   
             Both: Cheers.      

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,801
Would you stop                  
eating my balls?                
            I love your balls.  

89
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,437
               No, stop.        
              I can't get enough
              of your balls.

         Hey, stranger!         

95
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,385
               Hey! I know!     
                 How's it going?

96
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,986
      I'm good. I'm-- Yay!      

97
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,522
               Hey, it's so good
               to see you.      

98
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,257
     Since you've been gone,    
     I've been embracing        
     my heterosexuality.        

99
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,493
 Yeah, she has.                 
       Oh, my God,              
 I went on a wine tour,         

100
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,462
         a course.              
Yeah, but she got thrown off    
for getting wasted.             

101
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,997
         Okay, okay.            
    Oh, my God.                 
    We get couples' massages.   

102
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,433
            Nice!               
   We got book club.            

103
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,234
   I had, like, dinner parties  
   where I kind of cook         

104
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,537
     a little bit.              
      Which we don't get        
      invited to, but, you know.

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,938
   Oh, you'd come               
   if I invited you?            

106
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,740
                   Probably not.
                   There's only,
                   so many times

107
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,374
      I can hear you talk       
      about the Container Store.

108
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,009
I love the Container Store!     
                  I know you do.

109
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,111
  Oh, would you rather          
  me talk about poultry?        
                No, no, no.     

110
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,648
   Wait. Do I hear the ding-dong
   of wedding bells?            
     Oh, God.                   

111
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,883
            Are the two of you  
            gonna follow Agustín
            down the aisle?     

112
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,485
Yeah, right.                    
     Mm-mm.                     
     Sorry, Disney princess.    

113
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,353
     No, that dream's           
     not happening.             

114
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,121
          I'm embracing         
       my heterosexuality,      
That's right.                   

115
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,524
   but I'm not insane.          
                 So that's a no?

116
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,693
     Malik and I made           
     a very important commitment

117
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,195
         to living in sin, okay?
   Yeah. We're living in sin.   
   We embrace the sin.          

118
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,997
                     Absolutely.
         Sunday morning,        
      we're not in church.      

119
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,132
       Marriage is for the gays,
       all right?               

120
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,801
  And you poor fucking bastards,

121
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,003
            you can have it.    
          It's a magical time!  
                             Aw!

122
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,472
           (laughter)           
                 Yay!           

123
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,574
             Aw, that was       
             the best news ever!
            Yeah!               

124
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,209
 Doris: Congratulations!        
       All: Whoo! Cheers!       

125
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,912
           (cheering)           

126
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,215
          Hey!                  
Hi! How's it going?             
My God!                         

127
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,551
How you doing? Congrats.        
Thanks, man.                    

128
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,819
              Hey, Brady!       

129
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,355
       The prodigal son returns.
Hi. It's good to see you.       

130
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,224
Thank you, man. Likewise.       
Thanks for coming.              

131
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,626
         Hey there.             
         How's it going?        

132
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,828
   Good. How are you?           
     Good. Doing well.          

133
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,563
  Nice, nice.                   
         Yeah, yeah.            

134
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,931
    Hi, Kyah.                   

135
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,232
             Hi!                
        Hi.                     

136
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,869
     I am so the new Patrick    
     of the group.              
            Oh...               

137
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,004
           (laughter)           

138
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,839
           Hello.               
               Hi.              

139
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,975
             How are you guys?  
               I'm good. Hi.    

140
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,611
Oh, my God.                     
We're all back together!        

141
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,045
      Oh, hi. Oh!               
             Hi.                

142
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,580
Patrick, how is it going?       

143
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,449
I want to hear about--          
tell us about what your life--  

144
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,184
   I don't know.                
Well, how's Boise?              
   How's Boise?                 

145
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,820
  Well, it's Denver, not Boise. 

146
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,955
           (laughter)           
Same thing, same thing.         

147
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,690
         But it's good.         
        It's really good.       
         I'm loving work        

148
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,291
    and I'm finally the head    
    of my own department,       

149
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,960
    so that's been              
    a long time coming, yeah.   

150
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,162
    That's fantastic.           
No more cage-fighting homos?    

151
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,097
No more otters versus owls?     

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,465
            Wow.                
  Is that the video game?       

153
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,634
    Not at work at least, no.   

154
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,801
          What is it            
          you're actually doing?

155
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,169
       I've asked,              
       but nobody seems to know.

156
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,671
We're actually--                
we're developing                

157
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,239
 this virtual reality           
 video game                     
                         Uh-huh.

158
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,808
 where humans have              
mated with aliens,              
                         Yes.   

159
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,545
and they've created             
a super race                    
with special abilities.         

160
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,180
              I'm in. I'm so in.
Yes! It's actually              
a really cool game.             

161
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,415
                 Can I have one?
Absolutely!                     

162
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,351
      Of course you're in.      
      Anything alien, sold.     

163
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,954
But what is there to do         
in Salt Lake City?              

164
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,288
What do you do?                 
                 Richie: Denver.

165
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,190
      Thank you.                
In Denver too.                  
What do you do in Denver?       

166
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,491
Goddammit, sorry.               

167
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,161
Brady:                          
You don't miss it here?         

168
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,563
    I mean, I miss you guys.    

169
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,797
     I miss the people for sure.

170
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,933
    But in a lot of ways,       
    the cities are very similar.

171
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,668
             It's the same      
             small-batch coffee,

172
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,070
      the same Korean meatballs,
      except people there are   

173
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,572
    a little less,              
    you know, San Francisco.    

174
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,774
     In the way--               
     in the way the people--    
Oh, my God, no, come on.        

175
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,108
No, you know,                   
in the way the people           

176
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,510
 in San Fransisco               
 can be annoying.               

177
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,913
           You know what        
           I'm talking about.   
               I totally get it.

178
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,849
Are there any gays?             
              Are there any gays
              in Denver?        

179
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,350
    Yeah, there's a lot of gays.

180
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,786
       It's a-- it's a big city.

181
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,688
         And Paddy's been making
         the most of being      

182
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,724
            the single cowgirl  
            in town, right?     
    I have. I have.             

183
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,125
           Is it like           
           "Brokeback Mountain"?

184
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,696
           Are you just,        
           like, having sex     
           with Jake Gyllenhaal?

185
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,197
           (laughter)           

186
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,366
   No, but I, uh,               
   I broke this back-mountain   

187
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,002
        a couple of times,      
        if you know what I mean.

188
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,204
         Oh, hey!               
    Yes, yes, yes, yeah.        

189
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,338
                   Patrick:     
                   I did, I did.

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,941
           Girl, you've changed.
           (laughter)           

191
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:28,178
I can't believe I...            
have this stupid bag.           

192
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,580
                 Oh, God.       

193
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,682
           Your hair looks good.

194
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,283
    (chuckles)                  
    Thank you.                  

195
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,586
             Kept it short, huh?
         I did, yeah.           

196
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,121
                 Short on the...
           Yeah.                

197
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,489
       Short on the sides.      

198
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,426
                     It's good  
                     to see you.

199
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,728
                 You too.       

200
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,429
               Sorry I was      
               so incommunicado,

201
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,964
      but it just felt          
      like the right thing to do

202
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,499
            while I got settled,
            and then...         

203
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,635
You don't need to explain.      

204
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,536
             Yeah, but I left-- 
             I left so suddenly 

205
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,105
              without much      
              of an explanation.

206
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,973
   You did                      
   what you had to do.          

207
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,407
                       I did.   

208
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,876
    So, don't sweat it.         

209
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,745
                      All right.

210
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,648
So what's it like               
being back home                 

211
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,315
so close to your folks?         

212
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,651
            Well, I'm near home.

213
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,218
                I'm not at home,
                and that, uh,   

214
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,487
50-minute car ride              
makes all the difference.       

215
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,857
                     Ah.        
       But, uh...               

216
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,092
It's been pretty positive.      

217
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,327
I never thought that            
I could actually be there       

218
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:20,064
and be myself,                  
so that feels like progress.    

219
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,666
              Well, that's good.
         Yeah.                  

220
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,034
             And how's your mom?

221
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,568
        She's all right.        

222
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,370
      It's probably helpful     
      that I was there          

223
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,105
    and only semi-judgmental    
    about her choice            

224
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,974
     to drop my dad.            
                      Mm.       

225
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,542
              How are you       
              about the divorce?

226
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,210
             Me?                
                     Yeah.      

227
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,779
          I'm 30.               
          (chuckles)            

228
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,947
                   I don't think
                   that matters.

229
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,051
    You know, she actually      
    dumped the guy              

230
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,219
that she left my dad for,       
                     Oh, my God.

231
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,453
 and now she's having sex       

232
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,456
    with her therapist,         
    Dr. Sapperstein.            
                   Oh, really?  

233
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,658
        Yeah.                   

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,495
She really likes making         
a fucking mess of things.       

235
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,164
   But then, uh...              

236
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:55,499
  like mother like son,         
  I guess.                      

237
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,335
             I'm saying nothing.

238
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,570
           (chuckles)           

239
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,872
  So, I...                      

240
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,808
I finally followed              
your advice and tried           

241
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,810
to work things out              
with my dad.                    
                    Good.       

242
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,245
Yeah, it turns out              
that advice totally sucked.     

243
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,947
               Oh, shit. Really?

244
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,015
    Yeah.                       

245
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,217
I tried to honor the fact       
that he would never be          

246
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:14,785
completely happy                
with who I am                   

247
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,521
and try to find                 
a common ground, but...         

248
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,889
                 There was none?

249
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,425
Turns out he is                 
a raging homophobe.             

250
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,359
                    (sighs)     

251
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,728
It's like him trying            
to understand me                

252
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,296
undermines everything           
he thinks about himself, so...  

253
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:27,231
                      Oh, God.  

254
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,967
         Do you think           
         he'll ever come around?

255
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,436
He's a proud fucker,            
so probably not.                

256
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:37,074
               Well, if I'm like
               my mom, then...  
   (chuckles)                   

257
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,910
Shut up.                        
                  (chuckles)    

258
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,080
But Brady has been really cool  
about the whole thing.          

259
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,716
He's been, um,                  
super supportive,               

260
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,752
so that's helped.               
                   Good.        

261
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,054
               What about       
               the barber truck?

262
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,289
              I've been hearing 
              amazing things.   

263
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,457
That's going really well.       

264
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,126
     And you don't miss Willy's?

265
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,229
Yeah, but it's also good        
to be doing my own thing.       

266
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,031
Actually, Agustín did           
a really great job              

267
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,234
with the paint work on it.      

268
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,869
He's really good.               

269
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,038
          I can just picture you
          cruising down Valencia

270
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,174
                luring people   
                into your truck 
                for a fade.     

271
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,541
     Mm.                        
           It's kind of perfect.

272
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,644
Sometimes                       
I want to drive to Reno         

273
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,446
and start doing perms           
in some casino parking lot.     

274
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,382
                         What?  
Just to do something            
different, you know?            

275
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,152
     Oh, my God,                
     that would be, like,       
     the best reality show ever.

276
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,821
  Or maybe the worst.           
  It's basically the same thing.

277
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,055
         (both chuckle)         

278
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,257
You should come by              
sometime.                       

279
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,357
See me in action.               

280
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,160
            Yeah, I'd like that.

281
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,761
           And if not,          
           you know, this trip, 

282
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,629
               then the next one
               for sure.        

283
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,198
        Paddy! Hi!              

284
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,232
               Hi.              
         There they are.        

285
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,701
                    Hey.        
       We thought we'd lost you.

286
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,436
I know. It's this bag.          

287
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,139
             Agustín has totally
             convinced me       

288
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,708
  I'm pro-marriage now, sorry.  
  Traitor.                      

289
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,811
Yeah, you fucking traitor.      
          Wanna get married?    

290
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,845
                      Right now?

291
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,447
              Mm, maybe not     
              right now.        

292
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,784
   Come on!                     

293
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,452
                  Come on, babe.

294
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,355
     You all right?             

295
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,556
               I'm good.        
    Good.                       

296
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,325
            How are you feeling?
 I'm good.                      

297
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,392
I'm a little tired.             

298
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,760
You gonna sing?                 
                 Yeah!          

299
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,296
     Oh, good.                  
    What are you gonna sing?    

300
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,798
               What are we gonna
               sing together?   
           (laughter)           

301
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,934
         Let's do this.         

302
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,971
           All right.           
I love that you've chosen       
all of our old haunts.          

303
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,272
               Yeah, I felt like
              I needed to return

304
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,441
     to the scenes of my crimes,
     like, one more time.       

305
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,677
   You're not dying.            
         I know, but this whole 
         "getting married" thing

306
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,314
        is making me feel all...
I don't think that              
the air quotes are necessary.   

307
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,049
                   ...nostalgic!
      Oh, shit!                 

308
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,117
          Bride to be.          
                      (chuckles)

309
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,219
                    You made it!

310
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,054
       Come on, of course.      

311
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,156
        Ooh! Ms. Murray!        

312
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,690
        Hello!                  
     Hello!                     

313
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,259
                    Oh, yes!    
      Oh, my!                   

314
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,693
How's it going?                 
         Yeah, good.            

315
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:39,429
   You what, you took           
   the Concorde in from Paris,  

316
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,698
             <i> n'est-ce pas?</i>     
<i>Mais oui.</i> Yes.                  

317
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,401
It's so good to see you.        
What a surprise.                

318
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,337
   What are you ladies drinking?
   I'm buying.                  

319
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:49,306
                 Something cheap
                 and strong.    
     Yeah, that's like you.     

320
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,875
      Like? Oh, okay, all right.
          I'm kidding.          

321
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,910
                   I'll take it.
          I'm kidding.          

322
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:53,978
                        (laughs)

323
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,747
Whoa. So you guys               
are friends now?                

324
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,948
           Like, actual friends?

325
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,816
         Yeah.                  
         Who reached out to who?

326
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,651
Well, I felt like I needed      
to close that chapter           

327
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,255
    before I opened             
 the new one, so yeah,          
   I called him up.             

328
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,757
I thought I told you.           
                 No, it's great.

329
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,092
             I mean, he's always
             been a good guy.   

330
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,994
Yeah, you know,                 
and just because                
it didn't work out              

331
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,062
doesn't mean it couldn't        
turn into something new.        

332
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,998
Plus, Eddie's cool with it.     

333
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,900
                Of course he is.
He's the best.                  

334
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,168
            He's the best.      
Look, uh, B-T-dubs,             
you and I are singing too.      

335
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,403
         Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
Yeah.                           

336
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,105
No, come on                     
for old time's sake.            
                     No, no, no.

337
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,639
   Please!                      
           I love you,          
           but bad things happen

338
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,009
            when I get          
            behind a microphone.
No, no, bad-ass things happen!  

339
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,243
                  No!           
        Please?                 

340
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,080
      Both:                     
      ¶ This time might be      
      the last, I fear ¶        

341
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,982
         ¶ Unless I... ¶        
Oh, my God!                     

342
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,717
           (laughter)           

343
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,120
             Why isn't he making
            eye contact with me?

344
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,155
                  He should be  
                  looking at me.
Dom: I can't handle this.       

345
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,223
              Sing to me!       

346
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,892
Wait, wait. I remember,         
I remember, I remember.         

347
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,727
  I think-- I think             
  his exact words were          

348
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,497
"I'd rather seal up             
my butt-hole and never suck     

349
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,500
 another cock again             
 rather than get married."      

350
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,802
       "I can't believe         
       that gay people are      

351
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,270
      "so fucking desperate     
      to be straight.           

352
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,372
        They shouldn't be       
     called "gay" anymore."     
                     Oh, my God.

353
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,141
Oh, my God.                     
Did I really sound              
that annoying?                  

354
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,542
                    Yes.        
       Brady: I want            
       that Agustín back.       

355
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,377
    Nah, trust me you don't.    
    He was a total cunt.        

356
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,246
            Ooh, I miss-- I miss
            the cunty Agustín.  

357
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,880
           He was so fun        
           at parties and stuff.

358
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,016
You've become                   
one of those gay guys           
you've always hated.            

359
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,953
Soon you'll be adopting babies  
and going on family cruises     

360
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,620
       with all the other       
       Stepford homos.          

361
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:11,956
Hey, leave him alone.           

362
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,657
    Yeah, yeah. Don't listen    
    to them, Agustín.           

363
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,292
    I think that what           
    you're doing is amazing.    

364
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,894
      It's okay, Paddy.         
      I can take it.            
You know I'm kidding.           

365
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,529
You know I'm messing            
around with you.                

366
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,565
I'm thrilled for you            
and I think-- I think that,     
           Thank you.           

367
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,936
uh, Eddie is a shining light    
of awesomeness in your life,    

368
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,373
and you're doing it             
for the right reasons...        

369
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,275
so what's there not to love?    

370
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,943
        Thank you, Frank.       

371
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,311
         Aw, that was beautiful.

372
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,080
Just don't fuck                 
it up, all right?               

373
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,816
Yeah, like, stay away           
from RentBoys for starters.     

374
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,119
           (laughter)           

375
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,420
         Okay...                

376
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,789
I know that I said I wouldn't,  
but fuck it, let's do this.     

377
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,624
We're gonna sing?               
     Yes, we're gonna sing!     

378
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,493
Can I finally be Dusty?         
                   Yes, you can!

379
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,295
Oh, my God, let's do it!        
    Let's do this!              

380
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,796
       Dom:                     
       "I will never suck       
       a cock again."           

381
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:57,667
   Frank:                       
   That's my advice. Stay away  
   from RentBoys. Right?        

382
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,703
   Agustín:                     
   This was actually            
   the first club me and Paddy  

383
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,005
       ever came to in the city.
      Yes.                      

384
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,040
         That's also where      
         me and Paddy hooked up.
            True.               

385
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,708
Ha. Yes, it was.                
     Ooh, hold on a second.     

386
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,011
     Muscle Mary                
     and Goody Two-Shoes?       

387
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,213
       Get the fuck outta here, 
            there's no way.     
              "Goody Two-Shoes"?

388
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,015
                 Really?        
I didn't know                   
you guys hooked up.             

389
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,916
       Oh, yeah.                
            Yes, yes, but it was
            a long time ago.    

390
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,485
              and we do not need
               to go back there.

391
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,487
Uh, yeah, we do.                
               No, we do not!   

392
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:18,955
          Come on.              
      All:                      
      Story, story, story!      

393
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,591
   Uh, once upon a time,        
   there was a pretty princess  
   called Paddy.                

394
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,927
     He was all by himself,     
     poor lonely baby.          

395
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,032
 Totally wasted and dancing     
 to Britney, remember?          
             Yeah. Mm-hmm. I do.

396
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,068
And I'm assuming we've all      
seen Paddy's drunk dancing.     

397
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,169
        Uh-huh.                 
           I have.              

398
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,504
          Oh.                   
      Yeah? What's it like?     

399
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,572
             Enthusiastic.      
           (laughter)           

400
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,706
           Did you guys fuck?   

401
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,909
           (laughter)           

402
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,976
I wouldn't say "fuck."          

403
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,279
    It was more like            
    side-by-side jerking off,   

404
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,881
 although, I do remember        
 almost giving you a blowjob.   

405
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,716
Oh, I remember you              
 licking the sides              

406
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:47,984
but refusing                    
to put the tip in.              

407
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,619
        (laughter)              
               What can I say?  

408
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,322
       I was very disease-phobic
            in those days.      
                      It's true.

409
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,458
        I had a lot of          
        self-loathing back then.

410
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,226
          Back then?            
             Aw, come on.       

411
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,029
That was a joke!                
It was a joke!                  

412
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,466
Well, I'm glad you cried        
on my shoulder                  

413
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,900
and I didn't put                
my dick in your butt            

414
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,069
'cause look where we are now.   

415
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,336
          (chuckles)            
          That's true.          

416
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,337
       Right?                   
                    Yeah.       

417
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,441
            Hey, faggots!       
(cheering, laughter)            

418
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,577
    Oh, my God, I am so glad    
    you came in for this.       

419
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,612
  He never would have did it    
  without his maid of dishonor. 

420
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,014
I wouldn't have missed          
this for the world,             
are you kidding?                

421
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,916
Please.                         
    And this is my friend, Jake.

422
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:21,651
       He's my oldest           
       and dearest from Chicago.

423
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:24,354
          I'm trying to get him 
         to move here, so please
         play nice with others! 

424
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,622
                         Hi.    

425
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,724
      Oh, Jake, I want you      
      to meet Dom. Dom?         

426
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,159
           Hey.                 
         Hi.                    

427
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,562
          He has saw your pic   
          and he really wants   
          to taste your chicken.

540
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,589
                Oh, come on,    
                spill the beans.

541
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,359
Okay, fine. I was in            
a relationship with my boss.    

542
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,094
But after we broke up,          
 going into the office          

543
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,429
was like that movie "Saw"       

544
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,031
except without the cute guy     
chained to the wall.            
          (beeping)             

545
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,739
         It wasn't              
         Kevin Matheson, was it?

546
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,006
      What?                     

547
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,975
              Oh, my God,       
              it was, wasn't it?

548
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,042
Why do say that?                

549
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:15,779
        I just-- I know he works
        there and he's gay.     

550
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,814
     Ugh, that's why I hate     
     this fucking city.         

551
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,517
                  It's so small.

552
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,386
       Please don't tell me that
       you had sex with him?    

553
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,988
No, no,                         
but I... I would.               

554
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,391
Oh, God, those ears.            

555
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,760
I would tug on those babies.    

556
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,796
But I... I did                  
interview with him              

557
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,231
 though,                        
 back in January.               
                     Oh, my God.

558
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,733
                     for my job.

559
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,869
Anyway, I didn't get it.        

560
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,604
I, uh, I heard he hired         

561
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,106
some 19-year-old                
muscle queen from LA.           

562
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,709
               (chuckles)       
               Of course he did.

563
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,714
Uh, I take it                   
you two don't talk.             

564
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,716
    You and Kevin.              
                    Talk? No.   

565
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,719
       But he, uh, he PayPals me
       every now and again      

566
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,287
           for this game        
           we designed together.

567
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,756
 Ah. Cha-ching.                 
                     Oh, I wish.

568
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,858
              I would so happily
               give up those $90

569
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,528
           just so I don't see  
           his name in my inbox.

570
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,329
So why don't you?               

571
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,964
You have to bury                
your dead real good,            

572
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,967
 you know, so they don't        
come back and haunt you.        

573
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,805
                Who made you    
                so fucking wise?

574
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,006
What? I'm 22.                   

575
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,275
 I've had my fair               
 share of boyfriends.           

576
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:20,844
            Really? At 22?      

577
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,847
           You must have started
           pretty young.        

578
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,349
   Uh, 16.                      

579
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,718
     You had a boyfriend        
     when you were 16 years old?

580
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,986
    Yeah.                       

581
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,060
He's quite butch,               
isn't he? Kevin.                

582
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,063
          He's not so butch     
          when he's got his legs
          in the air.           

583
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,298
Is he a hungry bottom?          

584
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,903
                   Super hungry.
Oh, fuck yeah!                  
That's awesome.                 

585
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,506
So is he why                    
you left San Francisco?         

586
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,042
     Kevin? No. He's not getting
     full credit for that.      

587
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,945
Then why did you leave?         

588
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,314
     A lot of different reasons.

589
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,552
              To be honest, I...

590
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,088
      sort of made a mess       
      of this other relationship

591
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,790
               with someone else
               I was with.      

592
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,158
Hm, I'm sensing a theme.        

593
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,961
                  Yeah, exactly.

594
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,897
              And after Kevin,  
              I sort of realized

595
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,900
       what an idiot I'd been,  
       but it was too late then.

596
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,635
           That ship had sailed.

597
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,505
      I'm sorry.                
                   No, don't be.

598
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,007
                It was actually 
                the best thing  
                for both of us. 

599
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,677
     And the truth is, even     
     if that ship hadn't sailed,

600
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,212
          I probably would have 
         found a way to sink it 

601
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,247
              before it left    
              the harbor anyway.

602
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,016
So off you went.                
                    Yes.        

603
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,618
                So then I just--
                I went to Denver

604
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,453
        and I swore myself off  
        relationships completely

605
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,889
              in the process,   
              which was probably

606
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,625
             better for everyone
             in the long run.   

607
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,728
                     But...     

608
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,397
                  it was also...

609
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,633
          about just being tired

610
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,902
           of my life not moving
           forward, you know?   

611
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,404
         Or at least not moving 
         in the right direction.

612
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,440
       Going away was about     
       pressing the reset button

613
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,643
              and starting over.

614
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,413
        Do you know what I mean?

615
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,248
 Sure, yeah.                    

616
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,221
    And so?                     

617
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,490
                 So what?       

618
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,726
   Did it work?                 

619
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,030
The reset, did it work?

00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:37,507
    (groans)                    
    Hi.                         

630
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,843
           Could have slept     
           in your old bed.     

631
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,712
I thought-- Wasn't that         
Jake guy in there?              

632
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,714
              No, of course not.

633
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,049
    Okay.                       

634
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,450
   Thank you.                   

635
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,285
        And Agustín's           
        at Eddie's place.       

636
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,787
      You could have slept      
      in his room.              

637
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:51,955
 I'm not getting                
in those sheets.                

638
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,589
       I don't blame you.       

639
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,725
What time is it?                

640
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,960
       It's the afternoon.      

641
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,695
      I gotta get to work.      

642
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,397
    You can come if you want.   

643
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,433
Yeah. I wanna                   
see the window.                 

644
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,235
        That way you can tell me
        all the dirty,          

645
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,271
disgusting things               
you did to that poor child.     

646
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,873
           Oh.                  

647
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,178
             (sighs)            

648
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:17,847
  I rimmed him,                 
  he rimmed me,                 

649
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,649
  I fucked him,                 
  he fucked me.                 

650
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,850
It was very democratic.         

651
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,619
      I gotta say, I am loving  
      all this sex-positive sex 

652
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:24,788
             you've been        
             having lately. Huh?

653
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,690
You're sure it doesn't          
make me a slut?                 

654
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,758
            But does it make you
            feel positive?      

655
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,126
Most of the time.               

656
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,928
             Well, there you go.

657
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,164
But then afterwards...          

658
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,632
I don't know.                   

659
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,867
                  What happened?

660
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,335
Nothing happened.               

661
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,104
                    Then what?  

662
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,906
I don't know.                   
Maybe it's that...              

663
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,974
I went away to Colorado         
and everything was              

664
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,576
out of sight                    
and out of mind,                

665
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,212
and now I'm back                
and then there it all is.       

666
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,313
               There what is?   

667
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,448
Everything I thought            
I dealt with.                   
                   Like what?   

668
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,718
Do you think I should           
see Kevin while I'm here?       

669
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,553
     Oh, God, why would you even
     think about doing that?    

670
00:25:57,655 --> 00:26:00,156
I don't know,                   
just to close the chapter?      

671
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,324
Bury the dead?                  

672
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,559
See if he's gotten              
fat and gross?                  

673
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:06,596
      Just assume he's gotten   
      fat and gross and move on.

674
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,897
You're right.                   

675
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,432
             Yeah, and trust me.
    Totally, man.               

676
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,666
     Oh, my God!                

677
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,203
I forgot that                   
you have a parklet!             
              Yeah!             

678
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:15,772
Holy shit, it looks so good!    
                     Right?     

679
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,107
If this doesn't mean            
you've made it,                 

680
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,808
I don't know what does.         
You have a parklet.             

681
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,076
                   Hey.         
                      Hi.       

682
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,111
        Hey.                    

683
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,578
          What, is it Bring Your
          Daughter To Work Day  

684
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,647
        or something?           
        What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?        

685
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,316
   Well, I came to talk to you. 
   I didn't come to talk to you.

686
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:28,885
               Go home.         
I'm sorry. I can go home.       

687
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,787
                  No, it's fine.
                   Fine. Please.

688
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,790
   Um, does anybody first of all
   have a donut? I'm starving.  

689
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,025
              And what do you do
              for a hangover?   

690
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,127
         And I want to throw up.

691
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,129
       Patrick:                 
       And he was totally       
       into Dom too.            

692
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,130
         He was? Great.         
                     Yes.       

693
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,132
      And was he nice?          
               He was very nice.

694
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,499
        Oh! So did you fuck him?

695
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,734
    Is he gonna move in with ya?

696
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,602
        Help you clean          
        the grease stains       
        off your aprons?        

697
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,371
  Uh, no. No to both of those.  

698
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,740
   And do we really need to     
   have this conversation again?

699
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,275
Again? We're having it again?   

700
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,877
How can that be?                
I haven't seen you in months.   

701
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,645
           I saw you last night.
 Aw, it didn't count.           

702
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,247
             Well, that was     
             before you ran home

703
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:59,282
           for a hot bubble bath
           and an early night.  

704
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,051
    Yeah, well, I don't get     
    to stay out the all hours   

705
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,486
  just enjoying myself anymore. 

706
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,054
Eh, it never                    
used to stop you.               

707
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,056
         Um, not that I'm taking
         Doris' side here,      

708
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,092
         but why didn't you have
         sex with Jake?         

709
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,227
           He lives in Chicago. 
           It would just be sex.

710
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,929
                      Mm.       

711
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,198
         I want to keep         
         my focus clear.        

712
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,167
   I don't want to complicate   
   things right now.            

713
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,802
              (scoffs)          
              Complicate things.

714
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,203
          Doesn't mean you gotta
          turn into, like,      

715
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,371
              Sister Dominic    
              of the Tenderloin.
         That's it!             

716
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,274
     That should be the name    
     for the second window.     

717
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,608
             Are you kidding me?

718
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,410
             This is so what    
             he's like, Patrick!

719
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,711
            This is what        
            I have to deal with.

720
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,713
                  The only thing
                  he ever thinks
                  about is work!

721
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,215
               Dom:             
               Well, is that    
               so bad right now?

722
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,316
I think                         
that all we're saying           

723
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,617
is it's okay                    
to have a little fun.           

724
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,152
                      Yes.      
Get your hands                  
on some skin                    

725
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,021
that doesn't belong             
to a plucked chicken.           
                      Ew.       

726
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,722
          Okay, listen.         

727
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,091
    I appreciate the concern.   

728
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,726
              I do.             

729
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,295
          But I'm fine.         

730
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,899
    You know, finally I know    
     what it is that I want,    

731
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,367
      and... better still,      

732
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,369
      I can actually see        
      a way of getting it.      

733
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,537
     I've got some purpose.     

734
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,905
And you think sex               
could risk that?                

735
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,108
             Yeah, or maybe even
             a relationship?    
         Very possibly.         

736
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,577
                 I don't...     
                 God, I don't...

737
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,612
           I don't want to sound
           like some kind of... 

738
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,981
                   one of those,
                   I don't know,

739
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,282
              gross, coupled-up,

740
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,584
         relationship evangelist
         things...              
       And yet...               

741
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,553
             but you liked being
             with Lynn.         

742
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,722
 Yes, of course I did.          

743
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,993
 But that's not                 
 what I want right now.         

744
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,929
I don't want to compromise      

745
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,565
 and relationships take         
 a lot of compromise.           

746
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,868
            Can I say one thing?
Would it matter                 
if I said no?                   

747
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,470
              This...           
              this has happened.

748
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,939
  It's working. You're all good.
  You're not gonna fuck it up.  

749
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,541
            It's not suddenly   
            gonna turn to shit. 

750
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,245
      All right? And believe me,
      I know the feeling.       

751
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,514
             But I'm not my mom.

752
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,084
           All right? And you're
           not your dad.        

753
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,585
(phone rings)                   
Shit. I'm sorry.                

754
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,854
                You-- Am--      
                am I being too--

755
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,890
                   Oh, whatever.

756
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,691
                         (sighs)
Hey.                            

757
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,828
Uh... yeah.                     

758
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,830
Yeah, I can do that.            

759
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,032
        Yes.                    

760
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,201
Yes, yes.                       
Yeah, I'll meet you there.      

761
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,037
Uh, yes, I will meet you        
there right now.                

762
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,839
Okay. All right,                
I'll see you soon.              

763
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,174
     Bye.                       

764
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,011
    Okay.                       

765
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,246
  Does anybody want to          
  come with me to Indian Rock?  

766
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,383
    I think that Agustín        
    might be having a crisis.   

767
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:15,985
Oh, fuck, no.                   

768
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,888
          Not in a million years
           do I want to do that.

769
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,755
                    Oh God.     

770
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,524
                   I have to go.
You're on your own.             

771
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,192
             Okay. Good luck.   
     Good luck.                 

772
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,394
   Good luck.                   
                 Yeah.          

773
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:27,397
    Mm, you're so gonna get laid
    smelling like that. Bye.    

774
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,497
                      (chuckles)

775
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,167
           Oh, good, Patrick,   
           we're together again.

776
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:34,770
Patrick:                        
What happened?                  

777
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,039
You seemed so calm yesterday.   

778
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,640
               Yeah, I was calm,
              but then I woke up

779
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,842
        this morning with this, 
       like, pain in my stomach 

780
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,011
        like I had an ulcer     
        that was about to burst.

781
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,381
Well, it's a stressful thing    
you're doing, getting married.  

782
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,482
                        I guess.

783
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,818
I mean, you're getting          
committed to somebody else.     

784
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,355
 That's a big thing.            
       I don't think your choice
       of vocabulary is helping.

785
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,889
                Do you love him?

786
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,091
         Do I love him?         

787
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,525
Yeah. Do you love Eddie?        

788
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:59,195
       I always used to say that
      love is a social construct

789
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,465
      that doesn't really exist.
  I didn't believe you then     
  and I don't believe you now.  

790
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,799
            Okay, so what is it?

791
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,868
(scoffs)                        
Christ, don't ask me.           

792
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,904
            Seriously, how would
            you define it?      

793
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,475
Okay, let me ask you            
a different question.           

794
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:17,646
Does the idea                   
of being with Eddie             
make you happy?                 

795
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:20,483
Like, the two of you getting    
old and gray together,          

796
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,286
smoking weed                    
to ease the arthritis?          

797
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,654
             Yeah, that thought 
             does make me happy.

798
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:27,090
      Why?                      

799
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,691
           Why?                 
    Yeah.                       

800
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,227
              I don't know. I...

801
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,463
     I like his beard, I like...
(chuckles)                      

802
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,165
             his hat collection,
             I like that...     

803
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,601
         whenever I have someone
         I want to bitch about  

804
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,603
or there's something funny      
that I see,                     

805
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,705
he's the person                 
I want to tell.                 

806
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,207
He's my best friend, I guess.   

807
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,809
               I'm oddly jealous
              that I'm no longer
               your best friend.

808
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,712
Okay, he's my best friend       
that I want to have sex with.   

809
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,647
      Also, he has a huge penis.

810
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,948
Isn't that everything?          

811
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,984
I mean, not                     
the penis part obviously,       

812
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,352
but the other stuff?            

813
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,054
Maybe if you just...            

814
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,424
focus on that, this won't seem  
like such a big deal.           

815
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,625
   Right?                       

816
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:08,931
    Actually, I don't even think
    this is about Eddie.        

817
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,001
          This isn't like some  
          "Runaway Bride" moment

818
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,602
           where I feel like    
           there's someone else 

819
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,505
               out there for me.

820
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:17,873
Then what is it?                

821
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:19,708
             Remember when      
             we first came here?

822
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,146
       After we started college?
       Of course.               

823
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,149
              We talked about   
              our big life plan.

824
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,551
       Among other things.      

825
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,120
           If you'd told me then
           that a decade later, 

826
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,922
            I'd be working      
            at the Art Institute

827
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,623
              as a shop manager 

828
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,459
   and getting hitched to a man,

829
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,994
                    I--         
What did you know               
about anything in those days?   

830
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,030
I mean, we couldn't even        
get married back then.          

831
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,399
            You heard those guys
            last night.         

832
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,769
          Frank, especially him,
          Dom, Brady...         
         Ugh.                   

833
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,504
Don't listen to                 
anything Brady says.            

834
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,772
He's like a...                  

835
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,375
blog that nobody reads          
but in human form.              

836
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,009
                But those guys  
                were right. I...

837
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,612
  I used to think that          
  I would be like Keith Haring  

838
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:01,184
     or Robert Mapplethorpe,    
     but instead, I've become...

839
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,287
            Neil Patrick Harris,
            only not as cool    

840
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,222
       'cause I can't tap dance.

841
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,490
You could learn.                

842
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,525
                 Ugh, I'm being 
                 serious, Paddy.

843
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:10,926
               I'm not who      
               I thought I'd be,

844
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:13,429
                and that's tough
                 for me to take.

845
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,598
      I've become everything    
      that I've rallied against 

846
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,932
          for years very loudly.

847
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:18,401
Well, you're allowed            
to change.                      

848
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,669
Especially when you've found    
something that works for you.   

849
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,106
                But what happens
                if I get married
                and I freak out?

850
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,341
                Not about Eddie,
                but about me.   

851
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,277
    What happens if I can't cope
    that this new me is so far  

852
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,013
       from who I thought I'd be
      that I fuck everything up?

853
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,149
   What happens if I hurt Eddie?

854
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,284
              I-- I don't want  
              to do that to him.

855
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,652
         I-- I cant--           
         I can't do that to him.

856
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,886
What makes you think            
you'll do that?                 

857
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,189
         Because it's what I do,
         for fuck's sake!       

858
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,757
             Before you know it,
             I'll be on a...    

859
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,659
           on the phone with CJ,
           and I'll get him     

860
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,595
                 and a couple   
               of other RentBoys
                 to fuck Eddie  

861
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,263
       just so I can            
       feel better about myself.

862
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,464
I doubt that very much.         

863
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,032
I think you learned             
your lesson there.              

864
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,200
                      (chuckles)

865
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,435
                      Did I?    

866
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,040
You know what I love...         

867
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,377
over the last couple of years?  

868
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,579
When you found that             
something didn't work for you,  

869
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,749
you somehow found               
a way to fix it,                

870
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,552
and that made you happy.        

871
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,287
         Right?                 
              I suppose.        

872
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,122
I mean, you are happier now     

873
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,690
than you've ever been.          

874
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,361
Not in this particular moment,  
obviously, but who cares        

875
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,197
if you aren't who you thought   
you were gonna be when          
you were 18 years old.          

876
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,099
You have had                    
10 years of experience          

877
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,537
to figure out                   
what it is you really need.     

878
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,574
               That's...        
               that's well said.

879
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,242
 And you know what?             

880
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,211
This is not                     
a Katherine Heigl movie.        

881
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:39,582
Fuck her. This is your          
Sigourney Weaver                
Alien trilogy.                  

882
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,916
                   (laughs)     

883
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,319
You've got so much left to go.  
                     (groans)   

884
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,454
 You could even start up        
your art practice again.        

885
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,657
                Oh, no, that's  
                a scary thought.
        (chuckles)              

886
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,459
         Scarier than the alien.
        (chuckles)              
        That's true.            

887
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,596
Forget I said the last part,    
but you know what I mean.       

888
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,567
                    I miss you. 

889
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,403
         I miss you too.        

890
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,443
                 (sighs)        

891
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,184
            (buzzing)           

892
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,586
        Oh, my God, we're       
        just like Julianne Moore

893
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,588
       and Annette Bening in    
       "The Kids Are All Right."

894
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,690
(muffled laugh)                 
Totally!                        

895
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,625
                 Who am I?      

896
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,993
Annette Bening,                 
obviously.                      

897
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,297
          "You're sleeping      
          with him, aren't you?"

898
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,666
    (laughs)                    

899
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,002
   Dom...                       

900
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,804
do you think things             
would have been different       

901
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:37,673
for me if I came out            
when I was 16?                  

902
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,908
            Different how?      
I don't know,                   
just different.                 

903
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,578
More adjusted like Jimmy        
from the other night            

904
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,615
or better at being              
in relationships maybe.         

905
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,683
       I thought you didn't want
       a relationship.          

906
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,386
  Yeah, well, maybe             
I was kidding myself            
 just a little bit.             

907
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,288
          At least you admit it.
(chuckles)                      

908
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,756
So what do you think?           

909
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,225
          Well, I may not be    
          the best person to ask

910
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,493
             about relationships
             since my history   

911
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,262
         is with a meth-head    
         and an old dude in love

912
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,797
         with a dead guy, but...
     (chuckles)                 

913
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,198
           maybe it's not       
           worth thinking about.

914
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,134
      You can't go back in time.

915
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,837
You know, maybe everything      
would have taken                

916
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:10,706
a very different turn           
if you had managed              

917
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,074
to shoehorn your dick           
into my butt                    

918
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,510
all those years ago.            
             Oh, God, seriously?

919
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,711
      Yeah.                     

920
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,281
I would have gotten over        
my anal sex fear                
a lot earlier.                  

921
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:19,782
Probably a lot                  
of other fears too.             

922
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,384
               Remember in      
               that movie "2012"

923
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,552
            when California sank
            into the Pacific?   

924
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,589
You really think                
it would have been that bad?    
                    Yes.        

925
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,224
  And plus, we never            
  would've become best friends  

926
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,893
             and that would have
             been a real shame. 

927
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,695
    That's true.                

928
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,764
I am glad that                  
you're my best friend now.      

929
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,400
Especially since Agustín's      
out of the picture.             

930
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,905
         (chuckles)             

931
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:46,041
      So what if we got         
      together now?             

932
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,377
                Sure.           

933
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,145
    I don't want a relationship,

934
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:51,681
         but for you,           
         I'll make an exception.

935
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,316
Oh, come on.                    
(coughs)                        

936
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,685
     It's not the worst idea    
     in the world.              
                  It's up there.

937
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,487
You just said                   
we're best friends, all right?  
                  Yeah.         

938
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,957
And that is the perfect basis   
for a relationship.             

939
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,159
              Says who?         
Says Agustín.                   

940
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:06,028
     What the hell does he know?

941
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,068
            I mean...           

942
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:16,872
       we don't make            
       each other sick...       

943
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,774
             like...            

944
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,275
       physically, right?       

945
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:22,712
     Or do I make you sick?     

946
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,214
             That depends       
             on what I've eaten.

947
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,550
     I don't know. I mean...    

948
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,785
     maybe this has been        
     staring us in the face     

949
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,954
         the whole time.        

950
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,127
           You are actually     
           scaring me right now.

951
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,232
No, listen, we understand       
and accept each other's flaws.  

952
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,469
Your work is important to you   
as mine is to me.               

953
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,303
We like the same movies.        

954
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,805
I mean, on paper, it's--        
              (chuckles)        

955
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,374
Would you stop laughing?        

956
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,876
On paper, it sounds             
totally right.                  

957
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,078
      You are not being serious.

958
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,419
        (chuckles)              

959
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,987
Not really.                     
         Okay, good.            

960
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,356
      But it would be nice,     
      wouldn't it?              

961
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,458
   To...                        

962
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,695
  suddenly find something       
  by mistake that makes sense.  

963
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,363
   That...                      

964
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,265
  (sighs)                       

965
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,333
  makes it all...               

966
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,970
       easier.                  

967
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,434
What just happened?             
                   I kissed you.

968
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,469
      Why?                      
          I just-- I don't know.

969
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,070
                 I was just--   
                 I felt like it.

970
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,339
              I wanted to see   
              if you were right.

971
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,941
        Okay.                   

972
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,109
             And you looked     
             a little sad, so...

973
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,078
         (both chuckle)         

974
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,146
                How did it feel?

975
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,081
 A little bit weird,            
of I'm honest, yeah.            

976
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,683
       Right? Yeah? Like kissing
       your brother?            

977
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,985
Yeah. Oh, God.                  

978
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:13,522
I can't believe we did that.    
               Oh... oh, my God.

979
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,325
                   Oh...        
I think maybe                   
I'm a little stoned.            

980
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,893
                Yeah, me too.   
    Okay. Good.                 

981
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,863
      Oh, we should sleep.      
      (chuckles)                

982
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,767
I'm sorry I made you            
make out with me.               

983
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,938
               Well, you did say
               you wanted me    
               to have some fun.

984
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,272
        So fun.                 

985
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,508
         (both chuckle)         

986
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,577
      Go again?                 
           (laughter)           

987
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,053
        Oh, God.                

988
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,222
      It's so hard to know      

989
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,225
      if you're doing           
      the right thing, isn't it?
      Yes.                      

990
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,760
             (sighs)            

991
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,762
So what's the answer?           

992
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,932
         Oh, fuck knows.        

993
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,136
     Although maybe you were    
     right this morning.        

994
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,372
About what?                     

995
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,009
   About closing the chapter.   

996
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,579
  It's so easy to let the past  
   make a mess of the present.  

997
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,418
   You should try not           
   to let that happen, just FYI.

998
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,544
      (text tone whooshes)      

999
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,995
    (phone chimes, vibrates)    

1000
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,799
           (clicking)           

1001
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,001
    Well, this is a surprise.   

1002
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,503
  You're blond.                 
        Yeah, I'm blond.        

1003
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,805
You had your hair cut too.      

1004
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,040
You look well.                  

1005
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,609
(chuckles)                      
You didn't need to dress up.    

1006
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,744
              Yeah.             

1007
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,847
       Agustín's getting married
       today, actually, so...   

1008
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,082
To Eddie? Fuck.                 
              Yeah.             

1009
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,784
Well, I'd never put money       
on that lasting.                

1010
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:33,522
     Yeah, well, love is        
     a mysterious game, I guess.

1011
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,090
      Yeah.                     

1012
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,760
You look well, too,             
by the way.                     

1013
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,262
           Thank you.           

1014
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,765
So should we just stand here    
and tell each other             
how well we look                

1015
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,433
  or should we go get           
that coffee and explain         
  why you texted me?            

1016
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,202
       Let's do that.           
      Okay.                     

1017
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,403
I'm thinking this way.          
           Yeah.                

1018
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:49,905
     Cool?                      
      Yes, let's do it.         

1019
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,140
Cool.                           

1020
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,643
So how's Denver?                

1021
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,712
I love what you guys            
are doing there.                

1022
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,213
              It's good.        
      Yeah?                     

1023
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,116
                    Yeah.       
I hear you're finally           
heading your own chain.         

1024
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,450
That's a good thing.            

1025
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,888
That's something that           
should have happened            
a long time ago.                

1026
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,423
                  Thanks.       
A word of advice though:        

1027
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:11,794
don't go falling                
for any of your subordinates.   

1028
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,428
                    (chuckles)  

1029
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,764
               I'll try my best.

1030
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,168
                  How's MDG?    

1031
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:20,302
                    And Owen?   

1032
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,171
           I haven't really--   
Talked to him?                  
 Yeah, I know.                  

1033
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:24,272
                   Yeah.        
He's good.                      
He's been promoted.             

1034
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:27,810
Oh, Meredith,                   
she finally came out.           

1035
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,111
                     What?      

1036
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,378
I'm kidding.                    

1037
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,680
  Here.                         

1038
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,920
                Thank you.      

1039
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,254
     You look different.        

1040
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,656
      Not completely            
      different, but...         

1041
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,393
   Well, I lost a little weight.

1042
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,295
                Maybe it's that,
                right?          
 Maybe.                         

1043
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:48,964
I've piled on the pounds.       

1044
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,700
Jon finally embraced            
my love of fried chicken.       

1045
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,602
                 Jon?           

1046
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,004
Oh, yeah,                       
we got back together.           

1047
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,940
             Really?            
    Mm-hmm.                     

1048
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,143
Oh, does that                   
surprise you?                   

1049
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,678
                I don't know.   

1050
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:04,913
                 Maybe not.     

1051
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,982
Do you know in many ways,       
what happened between us        

1052
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,316
that was a good thing.          

1053
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:11,153
  The breakup--                 
            Barista: The large  
            filter, solo, black?

1054
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,354
        Yeah, that's me.        
        Thank you.              

1055
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,256
    I mean, the whole thing,    
    it just made me think deeply

1056
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,758
            about what I wanted,
            what I needed       

1057
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,059
in a relationship               
to make it work.                

1058
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,260
 So, in many ways,              
I'm quite thankful              

1059
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,895
that you came into my life      
and fucked it up                

1060
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,530
because...                      
because it's better now.        

1061
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,768
       I don't really know      
       how to answer that.      

1062
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,871
                  Jon and me are
                  actually...   

1063
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,505
                  we're actually
                  really good.  

1064
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:31,807
            We had some therapy,

1065
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,042
            which I would highly
            recommend for you.  

1066
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:37,780
You're not the first person     
to suggest that.                
                 Not surprising.

1067
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,082
             And then we came   
             to fully understand

1068
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,484
        our wants and our needs.

1069
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:44,787
You know, you've been           
here too long.                  

1070
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,421
You're even starting            
to sound like an American.      

1071
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,323
       Yeah, well...            
Barista: Small ecstatic         
iced coffee?                    

1072
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,491
       Thank you.               

1073
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,760
   And now if I meet Chris Pratt
   down at Fitness First,       

1074
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,029
          I can jerk him off    
          to my heart's content,

1075
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,563
     and that's completely fine.

1076
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,201
Well...                         
I'm happy for you.              
               Oh?              

1077
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,236
And Jon. And Chris Pratt.       
               Ah.              

1078
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,105
              Well, I don't     
              100% believe that.

1079
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,606
       No, I...                 

1080
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,242
It's not like I ever            
wanted you to be miserable.     

1081
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,144
I'm... (sighs)                  

1082
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,247
I'm-- I'm glad                  
it's worked out for you.        

1083
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,582
             Mm-hmm.            

1084
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:16,885
          Shall we sit?         

1085
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,254
         Yeah.                  

1086
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:25,294
Basically, I want               
to hand over all the rights     
to you for the app.             

1087
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,163
                    Okay.       

1088
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,699
            Well, we didn't need
            to meet for that.   

1089
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,335
I know, but this...             

1090
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,003
It's better                     
to do it like this.             

1091
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,139
I mean, I could have a guy      
draw up a document,             

1092
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,208
but I feel like--               
                But what if it  
                makes a fortune?

1093
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,775
It's hardly Minecraft.          

1094
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,545
    Okay, but it could still    
    end up making us some money.

1095
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:47,716
"Stereotyped,                   
cliche-ridden dross"            

1096
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,019
or my personal favorite,        
"What the fuck is the point?"   
                    Mm-hmm.     

1097
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,587
                 Why do you read
                what people say?

1098
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,190
  Don't you?                    
         Yeah, but I don't care.

1099
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,393
Anyway, making money            
was never the point.            

1100
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,595
             What was the point?

1101
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,700
   I just...                    

1102
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:07,469
I feel like                     
it doesn't make sense           

1103
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:10,572
for us to do it anymore...      

1104
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,140
together.                       

1105
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,245
              Okay, I'm going to
              ask you something.

1106
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,282
        Okay.                   
           Were you actually    
           ever in love with me?

1107
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,588
    Yes.                        

1108
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,857
I... I think so.                

1109
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,259
I mean, I...                    

1110
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,826
I certainly loved               
the idea of us.                 

1111
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,228
             'Cause I could have
             made it work.      

1112
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,265
       I could've. When I said  
       I wanted to be monogamous

1113
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,699
               with you,        
               I meant it.      

1114
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,769
I didn't want you to make       
a promise you couldn't keep.    

1115
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:44,406
Fuck you. How'd you know        
I wouldn't keep it.             

1116
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,874
              Anyway, that's not
              why we broke up.  

1117
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,943
                We weren't right
                 for each other.
No, no no, no, no, no, no.      

1118
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,677
How do you know that?           
                I just did. I...

1119
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,147
                    I do.       
But you--                       
you didn't even try.            

1120
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,983
You didn't even try.            
You moved in one day,           
you moved out the next.         

1121
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,184
You didn't even                 
fucking unpack.                 

1122
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,253
        Listen, I admit that    
        I handled that horribly,
 Yes.                           

1123
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,854
       but I apologize for that.

1124
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,689
                  And... (sighs)

1125
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,293
  Isn't it better to quit       
  rather than drag out something

1126
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:07,029
       that you know won't work?

1127
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,332
Okay, well, in a nutshell,      
there's your problem.           

1128
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,372
                     What is?   
You, you, you.                  

1129
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,274
You quit, you run away.         

1130
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,443
You don't take risks, ever.     

1131
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,178
     What are you talking about?
     I moved in with you.       

1132
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,380
No, no, no, no, no.             
Patrick, the risk               

1133
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:26,848
would have been trying          
to make it work.                

1134
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,584
The risk would have been        
putting in the hard graft       
to make it work.                

1135
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,320
Now, I-- I don't want           
to seem like a cunt,            

1136
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,355
but you are a coward.           

1137
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,857
  Oh, I don't think that's fair.

1138
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
   I couldn't trust you anymore.

1139
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,762
          And I-- I don't know  
          what hard graft means,

1140
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,230
      but I don't think         
      I've been a coward at all.

1141
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,732
Okay, well,                     
I think the facts tell          
a very different story.         

1142
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,701
       Would a coward have moved
       to a different city?     

1143
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,971
         A new job?             
         Left everything behind?

1144
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,472
     (chuckles)                 

1145
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,775
You-- you basically             
moved home.                     

1146
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,578
And are you sure                
you didn't run away             
and not move away?              

1147
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,347
They're two very                
different things.               

1148
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:01,450
And what next? What next        
for Patrick Murray? Huh?        

1149
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:03,685
   When that doesn't            
work out, I'll bet you          
  a million dollars,            

1150
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,720
you're already looking          
for the next thing.             

1151
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,356
     You are.                   

1152
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,823
       I know you.              

1153
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:11,659
You run away                    
and you are a coward.           

1154
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:12,961
You were a coward with me.      

1155
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,530
You were a coward               
with Richie.                    
           Enough, Kevin. Jesus.

1156
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,099
You hit a few potholes          
in the road                     

1157
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,767
and instead of trying           
to navigate through it,         
you slam your brakes on,        

1158
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,636
you start crying                
and you run                     
the other direction.            

1159
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,271
             Look, I did not--  
             I did not come here

1160
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,607
      to get nailed to the cross
      or to get us both upset.  

1161
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,110
So why did you                  
come here then? Huh?            

1162
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,079
Honestly, and please,           
please don't use the app        

1163
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,181
    as an excuse.               

1164
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,484
             I came here        
             to close a chapter.

1165
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:38,387
         To see if we could     
         move forward from this.

1166
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,355
Oh, what, become friends?       
Is that what you want?          

1167
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,224
Cool. Why don't you             
come over to my house           

1168
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,426
and then we can all             
have a barbecue,                

1169
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,495
me, you, and Jon?               

1170
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,967
       Do you...                

1171
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,769
I mean, do you really think     

1172
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:58,306
that you and me                 
could ever be friends?          

1173
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,314
                     No.        

1174
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,351
                    Sadly.      

1175
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,825
Sorry. I really didn't want it  
to be like this.                

1176
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:21,963
        I shouldn't have texted.

1177
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,466
No, I mean, it's good,          
isn't it? It's a good thing.    

1178
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,934
And it needed to be done.       

1179
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,369
      Just, um...               

1180
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,473
Draw up the contract.           
I'll sign it.                   

1181
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:35,110
Thinking about it,              
it's probably the right thing   
for me too.                     

1182
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,948
                 Kevin...       

1183
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,222
           Do you honestly think
           we would've worked?  

1184
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,661
I'd liked to have               
given it a try.                 

1185
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,945
            Look, I wasn't      
            gonna tell you this,

1186
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:14,849
   but seeing as I'm gonna make 
   a fortune off "One Up Him"...

1187
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,884
Tell me what?                   

1188
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,354
     I know of a, uh,           
     job position coming up here

1189
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,923
                that you'd be   
                good for, in SF.

1190
00:49:23,893 --> 00:49:25,594
     At MDG?                    

1191
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:27,862
   I don't--                    

1192
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,564
      Well, don't worry.        
      I'm not going to be there.

1193
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,734
               Jon and I are    
               moving to London.

1194
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,137
  Really?                       
                    Yeah.       

1195
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,571
       He got a job offer there,

1196
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,940
             and I've been      
             missing home a lot.

1197
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,242
Are you done                    
with San Francisco?             

1198
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,144
         So, if that something  
         you'd be interested in,

1199
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,012
I can make it happen,           
but I do have to warn you,      

1200
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,881
Owen will hate you,             

1201
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,784
but he would also               
love to have you back.          

1202
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,626
                Why would you do
                that for me?    

1203
00:49:58,728 --> 00:50:01,229
             Seriously. After...

1204
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,264
                everything?     

1205
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,132
Well, because despite           
everything, Patrick,            

1206
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,101
I just want you                 
to be happy, man.               

1207
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,539
                     Why?       

1208
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,740
        Why?                    

1209
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:15,310
'Cause I love you.              

1210
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,150
Look, don't stay in Denver.     

1211
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,752
Come back. And you can          
take that from someone          
who moves around                

1212
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,555
 to constantly avoid            
dealing with things.            

1213
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:30,559
It never works, but I think     
you know that already.          

1214
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:34,629
Look, if you're interested,     
just e-mail me.                 

1215
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,931
We don't need to talk again.    

1216
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,136
One last hug?                   

1217
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,605
             (sighs)            

1218
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,283
        Oh, shit.               

1219
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,714
Hey, sorry I'm late.            

1220
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,150
There was trouble               
on the, uh--                    
   That's okay. Are you okay?   

1221
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,686
Yeah, I'm fine.                 
Are you-- are you good?         
       Yeah. I'm good.          

1222
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,020
   Good.                        
          Don't worry.          

1223
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,355
Where's Eddie?                  
             Mm.                

1224
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,824
    He's using the toilet       
    for, like, the 11th time.   

1225
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,160
       I'm getting married      
       to an old lady.          

1226
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,764
    Oh, where the fuck is he?   

1227
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:17,131
         Hurry up, huh?         

1228
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,768
  We're gonna lose              
  our spot in line.             
   Have you seen it up there?   

1229
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:21,636
       It's like every          
       fucker in the city       
       is getting married.      

1230
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,738
  I nearly got run over         
  by a stampede of bridesmaids. 

1231
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,473
Why don't we have bridesmaids?  
      You have us.              

1232
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,309
                     Yeah.      
I'm Italian                     
for Christ's sake.              

1233
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,910
This is gonna be                
the smallest Italian wedding    

1234
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,479
in the history of time.         
   Okay, this is just paperwork.

1235
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:32,781
      We're gonna party tonight.

1236
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:34,516
    Yeah? Then why              
    am I wearing this?          

1237
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,686
Like wearing what?              
You're not wearing              
a wedding dress.                

1238
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:39,086
    Maybe I should be.          

1239
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,290
And maybe we should be          
getting married in a church,    
giving thanks                   

1240
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,226
        to the great white man  
        in the sky for our love.
That's not what I said.         

1241
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,795
      Look, we're not doing this
      for other people.         

1242
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:48,262
            We're not doing this
            for our parents.    

1243
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,897
        We're not doing this    
        for people we don't give
        a fuck about.           

1244
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:51,733
       We're doing this for us. 
       That's what we discussed.

1245
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,735
       Well, shouldn't my mother
       at least be here?        

1246
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,337
              Otherwise, why are
              we doing this?    

1247
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:56,871
           I mean, what is this?
           (chuckles)           

1248
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,406
                Oh, my God.     

1249
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,941
   Why are we doing this at all?

1250
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,277
           Okay, can we at least
           check in?            

1251
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,246
    I have to toilet again,     
    and this time, it's not pee.

1252
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,581
No, no, no, no, no.             
Hold it in, okay?               

1253
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,250
You have a powerful sphincter.  
Come on.<i> Vamos.</i>                 

1254
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,119
  All right, uh...              
  I'll meet you guys up there.  

1255
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,322
               Jake, can we get 
               Mama on FaceTime?
Yes, yes, yes.                  

1256
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,590
                     I got this.

1257
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,626
We should man the exits.        
Eddie is surprisingly fast.     

1258
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:19,994
                 He's not gonna 
                 do that, is he?

1259
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,963
Mm, he's had that look          
in his eyes before.             

1260
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,798
     I think Agustín's gonna    
     figure it out.             

1261
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,633
           Yeah, where were you?

1262
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:26,768
          Uh, nowhere.          

1263
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,437
         So why do you look so--
          I look fine.          

1264
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,673
        Shit, I need to pee now.

1265
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,641
     Really?                    
So do I.                        

1266
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:36,911
      What?                     

1267
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,312
  I really do.                  

1268
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,414
        Okay, well, you guys pee

1269
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,915
         and I'll--             
         I'll meet you up there.

1270
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,650
     Yeah.                      
               All right.       

1271
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,723
 Woman:                         
 ...by the state of California, 

1272
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,225
              I pronounce you   
              partners for life.

1273
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:52,527
              Now, you may kiss.

1274
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:53,862
                      (laughter)

1275
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:55,663
           (cheering)           

1276
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,332
                   That's great.

1277
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,467
              Thank you so much.

1278
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,302
                    Thank you...

1279
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:05,440
(laughter, applause)            

1280
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,111
                     (footsteps)

1281
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,080
           Oh, hello.           

1282
00:54:13,182 --> 00:54:16,050
        Sorry, I think          
        that we're next.        

1283
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,720
             Are you, uh, Rankin
             or Lanuez?         

1284
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:19,987
 Oh, no, I'm not                
getting married.                

1285
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:22,156
It's my friends, but, uh,       
they'll just be a minute.       

1286
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,058
They're, uh...                  

1287
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,493
             Last-minute nerves?

1288
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,161
      (sighs)                   
      Something like that.      

1289
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,630
Well, it's very common.         

1290
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,331
I wouldn't worry.               

1291
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,002
     Those two have been        
     together for 45 years.     

1292
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:36,203
That's amazing.                 

1293
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,705
               Yes, it is.      

1294
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,545
Can I ask you something?        

1295
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,346
                   Of course.   

1296
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,248
How long have                   
you been doing this?            

1297
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,716
               A very long time.

1298
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,985
               Some people would
               say too long.    
      (chuckles)                

1299
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,520
  And, uh...                    

1300
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:57,358
Are you able to tell            
if it's gonna work or not?      

1301
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,293
              Uh, sometimes...  

1302
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:02,029
            uh, maybe I can tell
              who wants it more 
             than the other one.

1303
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,832
     Yeah.                      
                 Or, you know...

1304
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,734
            who's gotten real   
            and whose head is   
            still in the clouds,

1305
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:10,371
      who's willing or unwilling
      to, um, adapt.            

1306
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,407
     And...                     

1307
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,411
do you really think             
that people can...              

1308
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,947
change for each other?          

1309
00:55:19,048 --> 00:55:21,349
       I prefer adapt to change.

1310
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,852
         It's, uh, it's a little
         more realistic.        

1311
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:27,589
          Plus, I read somewhere
           that every part of us

1312
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,691
      has something to do with  
      the part that came before.

1313
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,494
          Every new part is...  
          Does that sound corny?

1314
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,696
          It's...               
          Well, it works for me.

1315
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,898
Maybe that's why we keep        
making the same mistakes.       

1316
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,233
                       (laughs) 
                       Probably.

1317
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,971
How long have                   
you been married?               

1318
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:44,539
                  Oh, uh-- uh...

1319
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,675
             between you and me,
             not married.       

1320
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,210
But your ring.                  

1321
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,912
                    It's a prop.

1322
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,515
      Nobody wants a fat trainer
      at the gym.               

1323
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:55,483
           You know what I mean?

1324
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,519
              Okay.             

1325
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:58,786
You okay?                       
You all set?                    

1326
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,021
                   Yes.         

1327
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,623
                  Lanuez?       
           I got her.           

1328
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,157
                Oh, it's my mom!

1329
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,458
          Mother: Oh, Agustín!  
                  Say hi!       

1330
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:05,960
Hi, Mama!                       
   Hi!                          

1331
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,962
I'm sorry, I think we'll just   
be one more minute.             
            Sure.               

1332
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,296
Okay. Thank you.                
                 Take your time.

1333
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,265
Thank you. Appreciate it.       
        Is everything all right?

1334
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,100
It is now.                      
                 What'd you say?

1335
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,670
Let's just say he's a big       
Sigourney Weaver fan,           

1336
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,606
so, thank you for that.         
           Oh, it's my pleasure.

1337
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,308
      That's what, uh,          
      maids of dishonor are for.

1338
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,311
I just told him that            
this marriage can be...         

1339
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,747
whatever we want it to be.      

1340
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:26,848
                Yeah, exactly.  

1341
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,315
           I mean, it's not like
           you're just gonna    

1342
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:31,318
        suddenly be monogamous  
        and move to the suburbs.
Well, no.                       

1343
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,823
And then I love him,            
and he loves me.                

1344
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,291
What's the worst                
that can happen?                

1345
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,726
Doesn't work out,               
it doesn't work out,            

1346
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,394
but at least we tried.          

1347
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,395
                     Yeah.      

1348
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:43,097
     Let's fucking do this.     

1349
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,432
       Oh.                      

1350
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,603
      (cheers and applause)     

1351
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,844
                Yeah, you got it
                all done, right?
            Yeah.               

1352
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:59,113
      Great. Perfect.           
      And if you would just     
      take a look at that,      

1353
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,082
   make sure we're saying       
   everything we want to say.   

1354
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,416
      Agustín:                  
      Yeah, yeah, I'm good.     

1355
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,085
           Hey, Mama.           
 Woman:                         
 Edward, you have chosen        

1356
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,687
Agustín to be                   
your partner in life.           

1357
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,022
 Will you strive to love        
 and respect him always,        

1358
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:12,526
  be honest and kind,           
   and stand by him             
  whatever may come?            

1359
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:13,828
                           I do.

1360
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,998
  Agustín, you've chosen Edward 
  to be your partner in life.   

1361
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,933
     Will you strive to love    
     and respect him always,    

1362
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,504
       be honest and kind,      
        and stand by him        
       whatever may come?       

1363
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,073
                  I do. Yes.    

1364
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:26,273
         (both chuckle)         

1365
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,676
And do you both promise to      
make the necessary adjustments  

1366
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,612
          in your personal      
          and professional lives

1367
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:34,582
           in order that you may
           live in a harmonious 
          relationship together?

1368
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,217
              Both:             
             We do.             

1369
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,021
        Inasmuch as you, Edward,
        and you, Agustín,       

1370
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,589
          have pledged your love
          to each other         

1371
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,558
    in front of these witnesses,
    by the power vested d d  me 

1372
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,960
     by the state of California,

1373
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,362
               I pronounce you  
               partners in life.

1374
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:49,731
               Mm!              
                             Ah!

1375
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,734
               Now you may kiss.
          (laughter)            

1376
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,368
                      (chuckles)

1377
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,005
Mother: I can't believe it!     
    (cheers and applause)       

1378
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,306
                Oh, my God.     

1379
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:00,508
                      Now what? 

1380
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,343
Uh, now we get drunk            

1381
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:03,945
and we take a lot               
of fucking drugs.               

1382
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,113
           Sorry, Mom.          
           Sorry, Mom.          

1383
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:07,115
           (laughter)           
         Let's do this!         

1384
00:58:07,216 --> 00:58:08,249
            Surreal!            

1385
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,084
         This is crazy!         

1386
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,352
Yeah, let's do this!            

1387
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,255
      (cheers and applause)     

1388
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,827
              You look great!   
              You look so good! 

1389
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,395
    Oh, my God!                 

1390
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:24,132
       (lively chattering)      

1391
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,535
        Congratulations.        

1392
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,236
     You guys look amazing.     

1393
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:31,839
    Hi.                         
Hi.                             

1394
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,575
    Hey, how you doing?         
    Good. How are you?          

1395
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,744
  Really good. Good to see you. 
        Good to see you.        

1396
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,151
              Hey.              
Hey there.                      

1397
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:44,719
How'd it go?                    

1398
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,721
            It was really sweet.
        What's up, Malik?       

1399
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,756
     Thanks for coming, man.    
     I really appreciate it.    

1400
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,624
Agustín didn't freak out?       
                 (chuckles)     

1401
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,160
       Yesterday, but not today.

1402
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:54,628
          Uh, Eddie though,     
          that was a close call.

1403
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,530
   Really?                      
              Yeah.             

1404
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:00,768
    It's so easy to disregard...

1405
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,303
                 all of this,   
                 all this, like,

1406
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,938
               being able to    
               get married stuff

1407
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,074
             and what it means, 
              but when we were  
             in city hall today,

1408
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:08,843
           in public, in front  
           of total strangers...

1409
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:11,378
                   I don't know.

1410
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,380
     In a few years, this is all
     just gonna be normal.      

1411
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:14,782
            Right? It'll just be
            a way of life,      

1412
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:19,553
          and that's great,     
          but wow, now for us...

1413
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:22,190
        and for all those people
        that came before us,    

1414
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:26,460
  you know, that actually had to
   struggle against something...

1415
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:28,662
             just pretty fucking
             incredible, right? 

1416
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,765
     It is.                     

1417
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,801
              And you can't help
              but feel...       

1418
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,369
        I don't know, validated.

1419
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:39,540
              Even though I know
              we shouldn't need 
              that validation.  

1420
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,876
Because just because you feel   
you shouldn't need something,   

1421
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,545
it doesn't mean you don't.      

1422
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,218
Hi, Paddycakes!                 
                    Hey!        

1423
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,554
       Mm. Sorry I didn't       
       get you one.             

1424
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,256
                    That's okay.

1425
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,058
What are we talking about?      

1426
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,761
Just... how great it is.        

1427
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,963
Them getting married.           
           Mm.                  

1428
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,664
             Champagne? Yeah?   

1429
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:04,999
                           Yeah!
                Let's do this!  

1430
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,868
      Whoo!                     
                (cheering)      

1431
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:11,005
               ¶ ¶              

1432
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,980
     Hey, man, can I please     
     get a tequila?             

1433
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,347
           Thank you.           

1434
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,885
Hey, have you seen Dom?         

1435
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,020
           Uh, yeah, he's around
           here somewhere.      

1436
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,088
          Ugh.                  

1437
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,491
I've been-- I've already--      
I made a round. Oh, God.        

1438
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:31,993
I so know that look.            

1439
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,527
Weddings are awful,             
aren't they?                    

1440
01:00:33,629 --> 01:00:34,528
They're horrible.               

1441
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:35,830
You have to take solace         
in knowing that                 

1442
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:38,399
it's gonna end in divorce,      
guaranteed.                     

1443
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:40,301
               Malik seems to be
               enjoying himself.

1444
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,302
     I know!                    

1445
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,870
He's dancing                    
with a bunch of bears!          

1446
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,073
 Oh, no, should I be worried?   
     Are you sure you don't want

1447
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:47,508
            to lock that down   
            with a wedding ring?

1448
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,343
         He's a total beef-cake.
     Oh, God.                   

1449
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,312
Wedding rings                   
don't do shit, all right?       

1450
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,613
Babies, on the other hand,      

1451
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,315
so much harder                  
to flush down a toilet.         

1452
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,516
You gotta really...             

1453
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:57,051
          What?                 
              ...work out. What?

1454
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,585
         What? Oh, my God. What?

1455
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,055
            I'm so drunk, y'all.
            What'd I say?       

1456
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,389
                     Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, are you--           

1457
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,358
                I'm not. No. no,
                 no, no, no, no!

1458
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,093
              I'm not, but think
              I'm pregnant?     

1459
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:08,462
      No, I'm not. I wouldn't be
      drinking if I was.        

1460
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,531
              Well, then again, 
             if I was my mother,
             I would be, right? 

1461
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,066
Oh, my gosh,                    
you are, aren't you?            

1462
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,535
        No, I'm-- I'm not, okay?

1463
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,271
        But okay, Sherlock Homo.

1464
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,940
               You got-- We're--
               Malik and me,    

1465
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,607
       we are talking           
       about having a baby, yes.

1466
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,911
Doris, this is                  
incredible news!                

1467
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,546
                 Oh, God, is it?
       Yeah!                    

1468
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,282
            That I'm becoming   
            this big, old cliche
            is incredible news? 

1469
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,017
Cliche? No, if you want         
to have a baby,                 

1470
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,485
you want to have                
a baby, right?                  

1471
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,354
                  Yeah, I guess.

1472
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,289
Oh, my God,                     
does Dom know?                  

1473
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,791
             No. I was gonna    
             tell him yesterday,

1474
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:39,660
         but then you ruined it.

1475
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,295
                        Oh, my--
Get a second--                  

1476
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,629
I haven't. Oh, God. Okay.       
                 What?          

1477
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:43,797
                Tell him now.   
            No!                 

1478
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,798
              What?             
                 Tell him!      

1479
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,367
Oh, shit.                       
Take it easy, okay?             

1480
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,435
 You're making--                
I-- I-- Nothing!                

1481
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:49,803
It's just Malik and me are--    

1482
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,205
we're talking about             
having a baby,                  

1483
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,573
                which probably--
         What?!                 

1484
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,575
      I may not even            
      be able to have one, okay?

1485
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,878
   'Cause I'm old. There's gonna
   be nothing but sand pouring  
   out of me, who knows.        

1486
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,779
             Are you kidding me?
     And if we have one,        
     it's gonna have            

1487
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,814
      his weird chest hair      
      and my overbite.          
             Are you kidding me?

1488
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,550
      No, I'm not kidding.      
      No. We are-- we are       
      talking about it.         

1489
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:04,818
                  Yeah.         
    Okay.                       

1490
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,453
         Unfortunately, that's--
Wow, I...                       

1491
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:08,055
              Where it's going--

1492
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,423
I can't...                      

1493
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:10,958
I'm gonna be an uncle?          

1494
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,226
               Yep, you're gonna
               be a gunkle.     

1495
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,494
Why didn't you tell me?         

1496
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,462
 Just-- I don't know, I just... 

1497
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:17,131
            But why wouldn't you
            tell me that?       

1498
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,832
       I don't--                
       Because I guess I--      

1499
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,734
  Because I thought that        
  if I was gonna have a baby    

1500
01:02:20,836 --> 01:02:22,036
       in my life,              
       I honestly thought       

1501
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,438
 I was gonna have one with you, 
 and I'm not going to           

1502
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,208
        be having one...        
        with you.               

1503
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,445
            Doris...            

1504
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,114
      I know it's stupid--      
                 This is better!

1505
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,349
                 Oh!            
            It's so much better!

1506
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:39,186
      All right, you're spilling
      your beer all over me too.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.           

1507
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,422
                    Okay.       
That's just fucking amazing.    

1508
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,257
        Yeah.                   
        Oh, the miracle of life.

1509
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,325
                   Okay, listen,

1510
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,993
       I'm not gonna get married
       though, all right?       

1511
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,461
     Don't bring that up.       
     I believe that's such--    

1512
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,263
 I'm gonna--                    
 It's gonna be a bastard child. 

1513
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,899
  That's what we want,          
  and for God sakes,            
  please let it be a gay baby.  

1514
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,600
              I want a gay baby.
Well, with you as its mother,   

1515
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:55,469
the poor fuck                   
doesn't have a choice.          

1516
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,737
                  Right? I know.

1517
01:02:56,839 --> 01:03:00,641
 But before I ruin my life,     
 I wanna do some drugs tonight, 

1518
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,310
   pretend we're 25.            
                 Fuck yes!      

1519
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,412
           Handsome Jake has    
           some, uh, moon rocks.

1520
01:03:04,513 --> 01:03:05,746
        "Handsome Jake"?        
Are you up for it?              

1521
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,114
           Yes, I'm up for it.  
   Yeah.                        

1522
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:10,017
Handsome Jake is kind of        
  weakening my resolve.         
              Okay.             

1523
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,585
So yeah.                        
           Okay, all right, yes.

1524
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,620
           This evening is      
           taking a little turn.

1525
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:15,522
      Yes!                      
           I thought it was     
           gonna be a nightmare.

1526
01:03:15,624 --> 01:03:17,425
         Wonderful.             
         All right, let's do it.

1527
01:03:17,526 --> 01:03:19,060
Let's do it.                    

1528
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,561
         (clears throat)        

1529
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,129
              Hey.              

1530
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,498
             Also, this does not
             last forever,      

1531
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,566
     this feeling you're having.

1532
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,534
             I know exactly what
             you're feeling too.

1533
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:29,837
        This whole misery thing,
        it passes. It does.     

1534
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,940
             If you want it to, 
             it will, okay?     

1535
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,210
           All right.           
I'll talk to you later.

1557
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,313
   ¶ I'm walking blindfolded ¶  

1558
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,282
    ¶ Completely automatic ¶    

1559
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,951
 ¶ All of my systems are down ¶ 

1560
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,586
      ¶ Down, down, down ¶      

1561
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,221
           (cheering)           

1562
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:59,493
        We have to tell         
        our kids everyday       

1563
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,128
    that they are beautiful,    
           (cheering)           

1564
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,164
   that their lives do matter,  

1565
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,533
        that they deserve       
        to be healthy,          

1566
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:09,036
      and happy,                
      and safe, and loved.      
           (cheering)           

1567
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,737
   And that's what Eddie does.  

1568
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:13,307
    Eddie does that everyday    
    when he goes to work,       

1569
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,376
       and that's why           
       I love you, Eddie.       

1570
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:16,677
        I'm proud of you,       

1571
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,779
        I'm so happy that       
       you found a man...       

1572
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,414
      (laughter, cheering)      

1573
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,485
  ...and thank you for inviting 
 me to be part of this tonight. 

1574
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,687
      Now, where are those      
      maids of dishonor?        

1575
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,390
        (cheering)              
       Patrick, get your        
       skinny ass up here.      

1576
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,797
                 Okay.          

1577
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,499
           (cheering)           

1578
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,001
                     Oh!        

1579
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,437
       Okay, you beautiful boys,
       here we go.              

1580
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,940
           Uh, I think everybody
          in this room can agree

1581
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:50,277
      that this, on one hand, is
       the most surprising thing

1582
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,513
           in the world,        
           but at the same time,

1583
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,281
           it makes total sense,
           am I right?          

1584
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,083
           (cheering)           
                Love you, Paddy!

1585
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,519
        No, this isn't about me.
        I'm not gonna make      
        this speech about me.   

1586
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,886
       Never gonna happen!      
                      Aw!       

1587
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,224
   I wanna talk about Agustín.  

1588
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,029
    We have been friends,       
    uh, for a very long time,   

1589
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:13,734
     and there are a million    
     reasons why I love you,    

1590
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,637
    but one of them,            
    one of the biggest ones,    

1591
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,639
       is that you are...       

1592
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,342
      ha-- always have been     
      incredibly committed      

1593
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,944
       to making the most       
       of your life.            

1594
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:28,382
   And even when you fuck up,   
   and we all fuck up, right?   

1595
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,816
         Crowd: Yes!            
            Yes, we all fuck up.

1596
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:33,954
   You-- you keep going         
   despite any sort of doubts   

1597
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,956
       that you might have      
       and you keep trying      

1598
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,392
       to find the things       
       that work for you,       

1599
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,127
   and you-- you found Eddie.   

1600
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,329
             Right?             
(cheering)                      

1601
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,698
           And... Yes.          

1602
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,567
     And it is really clear     
     that you two are           

1603
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,035
        absolutely crazy        
        about each other        

1604
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,171
    while at the same time--    
    at the same time            

1605
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:54,441
   being incredibly realistic   
   about what that means        

1606
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,110
      and-- and both being      
      really committed          

1607
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:00,648
     to figuring out            
     how to make that work.     

1608
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:03,083
           (cheering)           
                    And I-- I...

1609
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,890
I just think that that is...    
        Crowd: Aw!              

1610
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,725
Doris: Patrick!                 
Agustín: You're cute!           

1611
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,127
   ...amazing! And so, before   
   I start openly weeping,      

1612
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:18,532
  let's raise a cheap cocktail  
  to Agustín and Eddie!         

1613
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,934
           (cheering)           

1614
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,271
           To Eddie and Agustín!

1615
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,506
         (crowd groans)         

1616
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,107
       Patrick:                 
       That too, that too.      

1617
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,910
   And now, everybody,          
   please welcome to the stage  

1618
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,513
       my fellow maid           
       of dishonor, Jake!       

1619
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,014
           (cheering)           

1620
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,087
       Jake:                    
       Patrick, thank you.      
       That was beautiful.      

1621
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,722
               ¶ ¶              

1622
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,324
           Excuse me.           

1623
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,059
           Hey, guys.           

1624
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:48,229
                 A better speech
                 than last time.

1625
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,799
          Couldn't really have  
          been any worse, right?

1626
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,635
No, probably not.               

1627
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,573
Yeah, I need another drink.     
Will you buy me another drink?  

1628
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:00,941
   I don't have any cash left.  

1629
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,244
         Really? You don't think
         you've had enough?     
        Oh, come on.            

1630
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:06,247
     Come on.                   
     Big gay wedding, right?    

1631
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:07,448
   I want to get super drunk,   

1632
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,583
   so I can forget about        
   how dull we've all become.   

1633
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,285
              Aren't you already
              super drunk?      

1634
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:15,356
  Less of the nagging,          
  '50s housewife please, okay?  

1635
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,557
       We aren't married.       

1636
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,125
      Oh, I always thought      
      you'd be the wife.        

1637
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,160
       You'd look so good       
       in an apron.             

1638
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,596
                  What was that?

1639
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,832
       It was just a joke.      

1640
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:28,235
     You called him             
     a nagging wife and I--     

1641
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,537
              You would expect  
              me to be the wife.
     Brady.                     

1642
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,072
       It was just a joke,      
       that's all.              

1643
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,575
         Is your femmephobia    
         a joke all of a sudden?

1644
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,176
                        Brady...
       What? I'm kidding.       

1645
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,911
 No, it's okay, it's okay.      
 You can say it.                

1646
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,247
It's not it's the, uh,          
first time you've ever implied  

1647
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,683
that I'm everything             
 that's wrong with              
the gay community.              

1648
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,253
        Okay, I said you        
        and Kevin were, not you.

1649
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:47,554
                  Although--    
What are we talking about?      

1650
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:50,023
             About Patrick being
             a shitty gay!      

1651
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,558
         Richie: Brady,         
         what the fuck? Stop it!
         Oh, God!               

1652
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:54,261
    I love it when gays argue   
    with other gays             
    about being gays.           

1653
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:55,562
 Oh, it's fine.                 
       That's awesome.          

1654
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,064
  Brady thinks he's             
  the grand minister of queer.  

1655
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,534
      The leader of the gay     
      thought police.           

1656
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,170
  Uh, it's called having a brain
  that thinks about things.     

1657
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,706
          Sorry if I want us    
          to be a little better.
Okay, both of you, enough.      

1658
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,541
   Wow. Okay. It's a little     
   frustrating that sometimes   

1659
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,543
    Brady thinks there's only   
    one way to be gay,          

1660
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,011
          and that way          
           is his way.          

1661
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,746
              I'm just sick     
              of people like you

1662
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:16,283
     giving us a bad name, okay?
You would think that            
if there was such a thing       

1663
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,385
as "us," there'd be             
a little more solidarity.       

1664
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,920
      Well, maybe               
      you don't deserve it.     

1665
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,189
Brady, seriously,               
what the fuck?                  
   I will never understand      

1666
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,358
      why you're so intent      
      on making me feel bad     

1667
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,460
     because I can't live up    
     to some ideal that         

1668
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,463
  I'll never live up to because 
  it just isn't who I am!       

1669
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,332
           If-- if you feel bad,

1670
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:32,833
   that's probably not my fault.

1671
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,235
                   Enough, okay?
I'm sorry. Richie,              
you're right. I'm sorry.        

1672
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,171
Brady, I apologize, okay?       

1673
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:40,441
And I promise to read           
more of your articles           

1674
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,276
     and hope that one day,     
     I can finally learn        

1675
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,814
how to be gay and be            
as perfectly adjusted as you!   
                 Yeah, fuck you!

1676
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:49,316
       Fuck you back!           
Richie: All right, that's it.   
We're out of here.              

1677
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:53,086
    Why are you taking his side?

1678
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:54,020
            I'm not.            

1679
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:55,856
      Then why does it feel     
      like you are?             

1680
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,826
              This has nothing  
              to do with--      
Fine, yeah.                     

1681
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:00,193
Then-- then what                
is it about then?               

1682
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:01,528
               This is about you
               being too drunk, 

1683
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,163
          and this is a party   
          for Eddie and Agustín,

1684
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,198
        and it has nothing to do
        with how you feel       
        about Patrick.          

1685
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,501
  Well--                        
     Or how he feels            
     about you, for that matter.

1686
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:10,036
Typical that                    
you would take his...           

1687
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,606
Do you wanna be with him?       

1688
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,307
                 What?          
Is that what this is?           

1689
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,443
After all the shit              
he's put you through?           

1690
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,646
            Okay, you know what?
            We're out of here.  
Because I can guarantee,        

1691
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:23,149
he will do nothing              
but break your heart again.     

1692
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:24,317
     Okay?                      

1693
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,487
    That your plan?             

1694
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,521
                  What?         

1695
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,690
You wanna fly in here           
on your private jet             

1696
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,526
and steal                       
my fucking boyfriend?           

1697
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,027
                  Of course not.

1698
01:10:35,163 --> 01:10:36,963
Let's get the fuck              
out of here.                    

1699
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,538
        You're not gonna        
        come, are you?          

1700
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:55,282
    Come on, let's go.          

1701
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,317
Are you okay, bud?              
            He was just jealous.

1702
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,454
            What?               
     Everyone can see there's   
     something between you guys.

1703
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,355
   There's nothing between us.  
   We don't have anything,      

1704
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,658
  yet I have managed to         
  fuck things up for him again. 

1705
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,359
          Okay, that was totally
          not your fault.       

1706
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,061
        I could have just       
        shut the fuck up.       

1707
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,631
     Why can't I ever           
     just shut the fuck up?     
  Oh, shit, girl. You all right?

1708
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,299
Hey, wait a second,             
you have a private jet?         

1709
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,601
    How come you're             
    so fucking ashamed          
    that you have a private jet?

1710
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,904
   That's a legitimate question.
    All right, let's just       
    stop this, okay?            

1711
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:19,506
       I didn't come here just  
    to ruin everybody's weekend.
 Oh, well...                    

1712
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,975
              Paddy, you don't  
              have to say that--
        I do, I do, I do.       

1713
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,411
        Let's just dance.       
    Can we please just dance?   
    All: Yes! Yeah! Okay!       

1714
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:27,548
   Let's just all make          
   our way to the dance floor   
   and dance, all right?        

1715
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,015
          Come on.              
          Let's do it.          

1716
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:31,418
Sorry, sorry...                 

1717
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,689

01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,067

1737
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,437
I'm thinking about              
leaving San Francisco.          

1738
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:06,473
               What do you mean?

1739
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:09,109
I've been thinking about it     
for a long time.                

1740
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,845
Me and Brady were               
even talking about it--         
            Do you mean, like...

1741
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,380
               actually leaving,
               like, for good?  

1742
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,916
You did it.                     

1743
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,618
You had the guts to do it.      

1744
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,986
                 Yeah, but I... 

1745
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,554
           I think I was just...
           just running away.   

1746
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,556
   Who cares?                   

1747
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:26,392
Sometimes running away is       
exactly what you need to do.    

1748
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,795
         But you were born here.
         This is your home.     

1749
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,230
               I mean, you've   
               always been here.

1750
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,498
       Exactly.                 

1751
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,268
Everyone else gets to           
come here and start new.        

1752
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,737
    I've...                     

1753
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,105
I've never had that.            

1754
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:39,806
         Where are you gonna go?

1755
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,010
I have some family in Texas.    

1756
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:45,712
              What are you gonna
              do in Texas?      

1757
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,314
I can take the truck.           
I can work.                     

1758
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:49,950
At least there,                 
I might get to do more          

1759
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,719
than just fades                 
and hipster bullshit.           

1760
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,122
                 (chuckles)     
                 Better not go  
                 to Austin then.

1761
01:14:55,223 --> 01:14:56,556
  (chuckles)                    

1762
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,860
               You know, it's...

1763
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,129
            it's funny or ironic
            or something        

1764
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,765
        that you're thinking    
        about leaving because...

1765
01:15:07,235 --> 01:15:10,270
            just today, I, uh...

1766
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:12,739
                I was offered   
                a job back here.

1767
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:16,276
     Shit.                      

1768
01:15:17,345 --> 01:15:18,578
                  What?         

1769
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,213
I don't want you to do that.    

1770
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:21,682
                  What?         

1771
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,118
Come back here.                 

1772
01:15:27,622 --> 01:15:30,423
I need to do this, and I...     

1773
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:32,726
I don't need                    
the temptation to stay.         

1774
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:33,860
     I...                       

1775
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:37,263
I gotta get my head straight    
'cause right now, it's...       

1776
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:40,366
all over the fuckin' place.     

1777
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,903
There's so much that            
 I need to sort out.            

1778
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,437
                    Like what?  

1779
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:48,775
I've been in a relationship     
for a year with a guy           

1780
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,711
that I wasn't in love with.     

1781
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:54,347
     I think...                 

1782
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,350
    right now, I just           
    need to be alone.           

1783
01:15:58,353 --> 01:15:59,786
                I get that.     

1784
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,788
                  I-- I...      

1785
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,123
             I totally get that.

1786
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,357
               I get your desire
               to be alone.     

1787
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:05,658
               I mean, it's...  

1788
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,795
      That's what I've just done
       for the last nine months.

1789
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,064
         But at the same time...

1790
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,968
           being back here,     
           I've realized that...

1791
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,838
           being alone isn't all
          it's cracked up to be.

1792
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,742
    Yeah, well...               

1793
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:22,943
we aren't the same person.      

1794
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,812
          Well, we're not       
          that different either.

1795
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,848
       I mean, wouldn't you like
       to be with someone       

1796
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,515
              while you work    
              through your shit?

1797
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:32,485
    Someone who understands you,

1798
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:34,354
               someone who cares
               about you?       

1799
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:35,588
    <i> Pato.</i>                      

1800
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:38,725
        I mean, that way        
        you have someone        
        to hang out with, right?

1801
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,861
          You against the world.
  (chuckles)                    

1802
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,662
           You got someone to...

1803
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:45,365
                  make out with.

1804
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:46,532
                      (chuckles)

1805
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,936
      Someone to sit on the sofa
      and eat take-out with.    

1806
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:53,373
                   Someone to...

1807
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,608
         get old and gray and...

1808
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:56,943
                  (chuckles)    

1809
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:58,845
       I don't know,            
       watch "The Goonies" with.

1810
01:17:01,549 --> 01:17:04,084
 (imitates Sloth)               
 Hey, you guys.                 

1811
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:05,952
                   Oh, my God!  

1812
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,988
                 You saw it!    
Yeah.                           

1813
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,423
      Twice.                    
               You saw it twice?

1814
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,458
      Wow, you must've liked it.

1815
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,794
         (both chuckle)         

1816
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,698
                  Okay, so...   

1817
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,204
           What are we gonna do?

1818
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,575
  This is...                    
  this is insane.               

1819
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,611
I just broke up with Brady      
not even two hours ago.         
                     I...       

1820
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:34,181
    I can't...                  
    I can't do this now.        
       I know, I know, I know.  

1821
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,683
         And if you want me to  
         shut up, I will, but...

1822
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,718
           if that's the case...

1823
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:42,055
              then why did you  
              come back tonight?

1824
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,824
                  Why did you...

1825
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:46,259
             Why'd you come back
             to the EndUp?      

1826
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:52,665
What are you suggesting we do?  

1827
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:56,970
I'm not going to Denver,        
 that's for sure, and...        
                    (laughs)    

1828
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,239
I really need to                
get out of here.                

1829
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,309
                       Then...  

1830
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,647
      How about I come to Texas?

1831
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,049
      What?                     
                      Yeah.     

1832
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,251
              Yeah, I'll come...
              I'll come with you

1833
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,353
    or I'll-- I'll go there     
    after you've gotten settled.

1834
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,655
And do what?                    
You have a job in Denver.       

1835
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,490
You have another job            
lined up here.                  

1836
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,826
               Yeah, well, I can
               work remotely.   

1837
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,094
           I'll do my own thing.

1838
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,595
  I've always wanted to do that.

1839
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:23,964
                    I-- They--  

1840
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:25,866
             Do they have       
             computers in Texas?

1841
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,533
         (both chuckle)         

1842
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,137
And what happens                
when you've sobered up, huh?    

1843
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:36,276
And the wedding's over, and...  

1844
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:40,313
you've lost this, you know,     
sense of romance?               

1845
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,982
               Is that what     
               you're scared of?

1846
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,084
Of course I am.                 

1847
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:46,887
I have met you.                 
                (scoffs)        

1848
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,156
What happens                    
when you freak out?             

1849
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:52,292
Again? I-- I am...              

1850
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:56,162
so sick of taking care          
of people.                      

1851
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,231
I just-- I-- I--                
I don't want to do that again.  

1852
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,268
        I don't need you to     
        take care of me, Richie.

1853
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,903
                  Okay? I don't.

1854
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,372
                    I just...   

1855
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:08,308
        I want to be with you...

1856
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,609
                    while you...

1857
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:13,179
       figure out whatever it is
       you need to figure out.  

1858
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,083
           You told me once that

1859
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,652
        you were this close to  
        falling in love with me.

1860
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,657
           I was in love        
           with you back then.  

1861
01:19:24,759 --> 01:19:27,294
    I'm in love with you now,   

1862
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,695
                 except...      

1863
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,898
   I was afraid of that feeling.

1864
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,103
     But I'm not afraid anymore.

1865
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:43,176
What happens if it              
doesn't work out? Hm?           

1866
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:47,780
What do we do then?             
   Well, if it doesn't work out,
   it doesn't work out, but...  

1867
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,582
              at least we tried.

1868
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:58,191
             Do you want to try?

1869
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,427
           (knocking)           

1870
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,963
                   Come in here!
             Hello!             

1871
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:04,497
Come on!                        

1872
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,467
Come on in here!                
         (both chuckle)         

1873
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,411
            (indistinct chatter)

1874
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,017
     Eddie and Doris:           
     That's my paper plate.     

1875
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,952
                 (laughter)     
                   All right.   

1876
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,487
                       Hi.      
                     Hi, guys.  

1877
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,589
                 Hey.           
             Hello. Welcome.    

1878
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,459
   You know, this city drives me
   freaking crazy sometimes,    

1879
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,195
       but right now, I think it
       feels like the best place
       in the world.            

1880
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,562
Mm-hmm.                         
        Yes, it does.           

1881
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:38,764
       My God, these eggs       
       are disgusting.          

1882
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,133
        They are so good.       
                   Right?       

1883
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,535
      What is that?             
 Is that the moon rocks?        
Maybe.                          

1884
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:44,604
 Paddy, I think                 
 you should come back.          
 Mm.                            

1885
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,539
Huh? What do you think, guys?   
Yes.                            

1886
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:47,507
                     Yes!       
             Mm-hmm.            

1887
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:48,741
Come back down                  
from the mountains              

1888
01:20:48,843 --> 01:20:50,310
and live with us                
happily ever after.             

1889
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,845
      (chatter continuing)      

1890
01:20:52,947 --> 01:20:55,315
                 Oh my God.     
                 You've got like
                 two courses.   

1891
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,753
I'm gonna eat half              
of this and then                
I'm gonna send it back.         

1892
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:03,423
    ¶ I'll see you through ¶    

1893
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,691
     ¶ That's what I'll do ¶    

1894
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:10,563
       ¶ When your dreams       
       are scattered ¶          

1895
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:15,535
      ¶ Just like               
      the wind-blown sand ¶     

1896
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:17,203
        ¶ And you feel ¶        

1897
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,840
 ¶ You feel you need a friend ¶ 

1898
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,675
        ¶ I'll be there ¶
