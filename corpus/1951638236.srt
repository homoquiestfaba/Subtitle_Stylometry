1
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,072
<i>My father was a very big man.</i>

2
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,472
<i>All his life he wore a black moustache.</i>

3
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,236
<i>When it turned grey</i>
<i>he used a little brush to keep it black,</i>

4
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,711
<i>such as ladies use</i>
<i>for their eyes</i> - <i>mascara.</i>

5
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,432
<i>Everyone was afraid of him.</i>
<i>My mother, my four sisters.</i>

6
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,709
<i>At the dining table you could not speak</i>
<i>unless spoken to first by my father.</i>

7
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,918
<i>But he loved me.</i>
<i>I was his favourite.</i>

8
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,915
I want to call England.

9
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,911
Yes, I want to call England.

10
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,595
No, it's not London.

11
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,631
It's not London.

12
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,068
It's in Sussex. Hastings in Sussex.

13
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,799
You know the code.
You got it for me yesterday.

14
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,155
Well, someone did, yes.

15
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,711
<i>Quattro cinque otto due sei uno.</i>

16
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,791
Hastings, Sussex.

17
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,595
Oh, God!

18
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,631
Can't read this damn book. It's...

19
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,711
It's unreadable.

20
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,033
Can't even bind the bloody thing properly.
Come on, let's go out.

21
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,399
- I'm trying to get through to the children.
- All right. Answer.

22
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,111
Hello. Yes.

23
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,755
Mother, hello!

24
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,229
Yes, lovely.

25
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,917
Yes, absolutely. How are they?

26
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,477
Are they...?

27
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,551
Yes, lovely.

28
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,555
Hello, darling, it's Mummy.

29
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,031
How are you?

30
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,071
Is Cathy there?

31
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,591
Incredible, isn't it?

32
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,995
I think the St Augustine is incredible.

33
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,638
So...

34
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,028
- I don't know.
- Mm. You thought that the last time.

35
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,239
What do you mean?

36
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,790
You thought that the last time
we were in Venice, remember?

37
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,518
Did I?

38
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,239
- Well, so what?
- Nothing, I'm just...

39
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,949
What's the point of saying that?
Why did you say that?

40
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,430
- I didn't mean it as an insult.
- Christ.

41
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,398
- I'm making an observation.
- What observation?

42
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,678
I'm simply pointing out
you haven't changed your mind.

43
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,271
Anyway, I agree with you.
I think it's incredible too.

44
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,912
Shit!

45
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,269
What is it?

46
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,952
Look.

47
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,715
Got another pimple.

48
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,992
Tsk! The giris won't love you any more.

49
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,352
- I must need more salt or something.
- What?

50
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,477
I must need to eat more salt or something.

51
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,472
You don't need salt, you need sex.

52
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,471
Hmph!

53
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,552
- Could I have it with salt?
- Why not?

54
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,670
God! Don't they know I'm trying to shave?

55
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,590
Hello?

56
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,275
Yes, he is. Hold on a minute.
It's Simon.

57
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,277
What?

58
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,310
I'm only halfway through the bloody thing.
It's unreadable anyway.

59
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,710
This is supposed to be my holiday.

60
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,069
- Those two. Thank you.
- <i>Ventimila.</i>

61
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,871
<i>Ecco una.</i>

62
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,951
This one's for Jack.

63
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,709
- <i>Ecco la seconda.</i>
- And this is for Cathy. What do you think?

64
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,711
They'll be thrilled.

65
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,588
I'm going to do a little drawing of Cathy.

66
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,191
With spots.

67
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,878
And I'm going to do
a little drawing of Jack.

68
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,872
For Jack.

69
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,518
Jacko.

70
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,033
- What do you think?
- Fantastic. You're a genius.

71
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,111
<i>Grazie.</i>

72
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,751
Hold it.

73
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,395
Oh, come on. Smile!

74
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,917
- Would you take a photograph of us?
- <i>Avec plaisir.</i>

75
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,991
Thank you.

76
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,471
<i>Tiens-moi ça.</i>

77
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,839
<i>Voilà.</i>

78
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,911
Thank you.

79
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,990
<i> My youngest sisters, Alice and</i>
<i>Lisa, came to me in the garden and said:</i>

80
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,470
<i>"Robert, Robert,</i>
<i>come to the kitchen quickly."</i>

81
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,950
<i>"Eva and Maria have a treat for you."</i>

82
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,512
Cathy's been selected
for the football team.

83
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,151
-  What football team?
- The school football team. What else?

84
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,755
-  Don't you think it's dangerous?
- Not really.

85
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,119
Tell me something.
Tell me the truth. Do you like children?

86
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,794
- What children?
- My children.

87
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,674
I like your children.

88
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,356
No, what I mean is,
do you actually like children?

89
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,117
- You mean all children?
- Children. Do you actually like children?

90
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,431
You mean as such?
The species as such?

91
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,509
What I mean is...

92
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,639
The real truth is...
you don't like children.

93
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,748
What you mean is,
you think I don't like <i>your</i> children.

94
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,631
What about me?

95
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,114
Do you like me?

96
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,791
I like you.

97
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,635
And you know why?

98
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,312
No, why?

99
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,394
I like you because you're always
asking me such challenging questions.

100
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,392
You're always testing my intellect.

101
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,591
Did I ever tell you the terrible thing that
happened to me when I was a little girl?

102
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,150
The worst thing
that ever happened to me?

103
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,754
No, you didn't tell me.

104
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,153
Well, I was about seven or eight and...

105
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,839
there was this gang of kids,
boys and giris, and we were this gang.

106
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,631
One day...

107
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,588
some of them said "One member of this
gang isn't good enough to be a member."

108
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,229
"Does everyone agree that
we should throw this person out?"

109
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,393
And I said "Yes." I clapped.

110
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,072
Clapped?

111
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,752
Yes.

112
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,070
I clapped. I said
"Yes, throw this person out."

113
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,233
And you know who that person was?

114
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,592
You.

115
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,552
Yes.

116
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,911
That's terrible.

117
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,594
That's a terrible story.

118
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,158
Up at dawn for you and into a speedboat.

119
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,549
Where shall we go?
Where can we go?

120
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,871
Murano. They blow beautiful glass.
Very nice.

121
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,793
Murano! Lovely.

122
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,155
- What time's dawn?
- Dawn, signore?

123
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,552
Daybreak.
A speedboat to Murano at daybreak.

124
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,232
<i>And on the table were two big</i>
<i>bottles of lemonade, a cream cake,</i>

125
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,836
<i>two packets of cooking chocolate,</i>
<i>a big box of marshmallows.</i>

126
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,198
<i>And Maria said</i>
<i>"Look, darling. This is all for you."</i>

127
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,357
Colin?

128
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,791
Find anything?

129
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,351
Isn't this beautiful?

130
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,551
What do you think?

131
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,468
<i>And Maria said "Look, darling.</i>
<i>This is all for you."</i>

132
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,597
Are you asleep?

133
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,671
Mary, it's late.

134
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,318
- What is it?
- We haven't had any dinner.

135
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,391
What time is it?

136
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,032
Late.

137
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,675
Will Padovani's be open?

138
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,672
- Or what about...?
- No. It's quite late.

139
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,671
Too late. All closed.

140
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,275
But I know a very good bar.
Late-night bar.

141
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,912
Nice sandwich. Good drinks.
Very nice place. Very easy to find.

142
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,552
- All right. We'll have to take a map.
- All out. It's my only one, sorry.

143
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,792
- Let me look.
- Here. You see? Very nice.

144
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,908
You go straight out of here.
Turn and take a right.

145
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,072
Then you turn and take a right.

146
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,355
Right there.

147
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,432
Right. Thanks.

148
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,198
- Look, this way.
- How do you know?

149
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,031
What do you think?

150
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,995
- Yes, there we are.
- No. It's definitely this way.

151
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,071
I'm sorry, but it is.

152
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,475
- This way?
- All right.

153
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,798
Colin...

154
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,231
What's that?

155
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,909
Look at that bed.

156
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,874
- She reminds me of someone.
- It's like a space shuttle.

157
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,554
What do you think? Where are we?

158
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,271
Is this right?

159
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,351
Yes, definitely.

160
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,670
- Look at all this.
- <i>Collettivo Femminista Venezia.</i>

161
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,435
- Women are so radical here.
- I wish we had a map.

162
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,308
They want convicted rapists castrated.

163
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,991
See this building?

164
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,597
We've been past this building
about ten minutes ago.

165
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,830
Quite right too.

166
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,593
- What is?
- To castrate rapists.

167
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,673
What was that man doing?

168
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,830
Glass at this time of night?

169
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,115
- Come on.
- Very strange.

170
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,270
- I'm starving.
- I think we're on the right track.

171
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,351
So do I.

172
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,230
Good evening. You need help?

173
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,352
Well...

174
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,153
We're looking for a place
to get something to eat.

175
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,075
There's nothing in that direction, but I can
show you a very good place that way.

176
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,598
- Isn't there a bar just over there?
- No. Everything is closed.

177
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,274
- My name is Robert.
- Hello.

178
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,399
- Like to eat some beautiful food?
- We'd love to.

179
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,759
I'll show you this place.
You must both be terribly hungry.

180
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,070
All right. Let's go.

181
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,189
This is Mary. I'm Colin.

182
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,792
- You're English?
- Yes.

183
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,472
Whereabouts?

184
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,472
Mary's from Bristol and I'm from London.

185
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,994
Beautiful country.

186
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,753
- Your first trip here?
- We came three years ago.

187
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,798
- Two years ago.
- Two.

188
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,348
- Changed much, has it?
- Mm...

189
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,554
These posters are everywhere.

190
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,791
These are women who can't find a man.

191
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,032
They want to destroy everything
that's good between men and women.

192
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,918
They don't know what they want.

193
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,191
This way.

194
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,835
- <i>Ciao, ragazzi. Come va?</i>
- <i>Bene, grazie.</i>

195
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,999
It's very easy to get lost.

196
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,958
Often there's a dead end or a canal.

197
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,151
It's not far.

198
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,397
<i>Buona será, Robert.</i>

199
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,072
Please.

200
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,436
Monica. Jocelyn. <i>Ça va.</i>

201
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,271
This way, please.

202
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,035
It's the real Venice.

203
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,591
Excuse me.

204
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,950
There's no food. I'm sorry.
The cook is sick.

205
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,272
It's a tragedy. I could kill him.
Very sorry.

206
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,558
But this is a wonderful wine.
Full of nourishment.

207
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,311
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

208
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,235
Now, tell me.

209
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,949
I'm a man of immense curiosity.
Passionate curiosity.

210
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,678
- Are you married?
- No.

211
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,672
- But you live together in sin.
- No.

212
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,194
Why not? No one would stop you.

213
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,192
In this day and age
there are no standards.

214
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,274
What about you? Tell us a bit about you.
I mean... who are you, anyway?

215
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,590
But you have a child. Am I right?

216
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,671
- How did you know?
- I feel it.

217
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,034
I have two children.

218
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,111
A boy and a girl.

219
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,914
- This is your boy and your girl.
- Yes.

220
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,791
Beautiful.

221
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,871
Not yours.

222
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,712
Not mine.

223
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,673
Beautiful children.
They take after their beautiful mother.

224
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,438
Your English is terribly good.

225
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,151
I grew up in London. My wife is Canadian.

226
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,515
Any more breadsticks?

227
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,194
- <i>Ancora vino. E dei grissini.</i>
- <i>Arrivo subito.</i>

228
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,273
- Your wife's Canadian?
- Certainly. We lived there.

229
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,031
How did you meet?

230
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,272
That's impossible to explain without
describing my mother and sisters

231
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,432
and that would only make sense
if I described my father.

232
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,469
In order to explain how I met my wife
I would have to describe my father.

233
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,792
Would you really like me to do that?
Shall I do that?

234
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,000
- All right.
- My father was a... very big man.

235
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,629
All his life he wore a black moustache.

236
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,269
When it turned grey
he used a little brush to keep it black,

237
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,397
such as ladies use
for their eyes - mascara.

238
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,678
Everyone was afraid of him.
My mother, my four sisters.

239
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,072
At the dining table you could not speak
unless spoken to first by my father.

240
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,311
But he loved me.
I was his favourite.

241
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,472
He was a diplomat all his life.
We spent years in London. Knightsbridge.

242
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,554
Every morning he got out of bed at six
and went to the bathroom to shave.

243
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,950
No one was allowed out of bed
until he'd finished.

244
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,192
My eldest sisters were 14, 15. I was 10.

245
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,750
One weekend the house was empty
for the whole afternoon.

246
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,355
My sisters whispered together.
Their names were Eva and Maria.

247
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,876
They called me and they led me
into my parents' bedroom.

248
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,316
They told me to sit
on the bed and be quiet.

249
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,710
They went to my mother's dressing table.

250
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,878
They painted their fingernails, they put
powder on their faces, they used lipstick.

251
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,158
They pulled hairs from their eyebrows
and brushed mascara on their lashes.

252
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,836
They took off their socks and put
on my mother's silk stockings, panties.

253
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:37,439
They sauntered about the room looking
at the mirror, like beautiful women.

254
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,516
They laughed and kissed, they stroked
each other, they giggled. I was enchanted.

255
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,591
They fed my enchantment.

256
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,956
They whispered to me
that it was our secret,

257
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,955
that we would keep it in our hearts
forever, never reveal it.

258
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,876
But that night at dinner I felt my father
staring at me, staring deep into me.

259
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,636
He chewed, swallowed, he put his
knife and fork down. He looked at me.

260
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,395
My heart started to beat.
To thump, not to beat.

261
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,830
My father said "Tell me, Robert. What
have you been doing this afternoon?"

262
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,275
He knew.

263
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,909
I knew he knew.
He was God. He was testing me.

264
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,996
So I told him. I told him all that my sisters
had done. I told him everything.

265
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,110
My mother was silent. My sisters'
faces were white. No one spoke.

266
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,632
My father said "Thank you."
Finished his dinner.

267
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,111
After dinner my sisters and I
were called to my father's study.

268
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,957
They were beaten with a leather belt
without mercy. I watched this.

269
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,476
A month later they took their revenge.

270
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,680
We children were again alone
in the house. Nanny was away.

271
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,637
My youngest sisters...

272
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,472
<i>Grazie.</i>

273
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,030
...Alice and Lisa
came to me in the garden.

274
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,914
They said "Robert, come to the kitchen.
Eva and Maria have a treat for you."

275
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,309
I was suspicious, but I went.

276
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,960
I was so...

277
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,473
innocent.

278
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,916
On the table were two big bottles
of lemonade, cream cake,

279
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,594
cooking chocolate,
big box of marshmallows,

280
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,194
and Maria said
"Look, this is all for you."

281
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,352
"But first" Eva said
"you must drink some medicine."

282
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,120
"This is very rich food and it will protect
your stomach. Help you to enjoy it."

283
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,079
I was too greedy to question this.
I drank the medicine.

284
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,119
Then I ate the chocolate and the cake
and drank a bottle of lemonade.

285
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,716
They applauded and said that only a man
could drink a second bottle of lemonade.

286
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,828
It would be beyond my capabilities.
I said "Give it to me."

287
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,040
I drank the second bottle and I finished
the chocolate, marshmallows and cake.

288
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,910
They said "Bravo", then
the kitchen began to spin round me

289
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,549
and I badly needed to go
to the lavatory.

290
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,197
Suddenly Eva and Maria held me down

291
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,114
and tied my hands together
with a long piece of rope behind my back

292
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,079
and dragged me into my father's study.

293
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,073
They took the key from the inside,
slammed the door and locked it.

294
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,838
"Bye-bye, Robert" they called.
"Now you are big Papa in his study."

295
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,790
I was locked in my revered,
my feared father's study

296
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,158
where he received the diplomatic corps
of London, the elite of the worid.

297
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,315
And I puked and pissed and shat
all over my father's carpets and walls.

298
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,188
My father found me there.
He said "Robert..."

299
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,788
"Have you been eating chocolate?"

300
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,352
Then he nearly killed me. Then
he didn't speak to me for six months.

301
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,833
I've never forgiven my sisters.

302
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,798
My only solace was my mother.

303
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,075
I grew so thirsty at night,

304
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,438
she brought me a glass of water every
night and laid her hand upon my brow.

305
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,512
She was... so tender.

306
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,068
When my father was away
I slept in her bed.

307
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,633
One afternoon, the wife of the
Canadian ambassador was invited to tea.

308
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,110
She brought her daughter Caroline.

309
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,558
When my mother showed her mother our
garden we were left alone, the children.

310
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,237
Suddenly Eva said "Miss Caroline,
do you sleep with your mother?"

311
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,476
Caroline said "No. Do you?"

312
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,348
And Eva said "He does."

313
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,872
And all my sisters giggled, and Caroline
looked at me and smiled and said:

314
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,157
"I think that's really awfully sweet."

315
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,629
And she became my wife.

316
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,439
Not at that moment, of course. We were
both only... 11 years old at the time.

317
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,189
Where on earth are we?

318
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,191
Do you know?

319
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,478
Let me sit down. I've got such a...

320
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,988
I've got such a headache.

321
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,315
Can you press the back of my neck?

322
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,391
Just there.

323
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,158
- Oh, God. I'm going to...
- What?

324
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,030
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

325
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,236
I'm all right. I just have to sit down.

326
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,470
I can't walk any more.

327
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,631
Hold me.

328
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,600
What a terrible man.

329
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,671
Who was he?

330
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,990
We're on holiday.

331
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,117
Mary.

332
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,111
Wake up.

333
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,908
- Where are we?
- I don't know. Venice. Come on.

334
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,231
Come on.

335
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,351
You're a weight.

336
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,351
I've been bitten.

337
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,635
Try not to scratch.

338
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,955
I'm so thirsty.

339
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,239
You're going to have to
look after <i>me</i> today.

340
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,393
- Why? Did you look after me yesterday?
-

341
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,471
I'm so thirsty.

342
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,511
There's the waterfront.
Come on. There'll be a cafe.

343
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,029
Let's go in the shade.

344
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,350
We'd like to order something to drink.

345
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,829
I will tell your waiter.

346
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,679
I wonder how the children are.

347
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,834
Well, you spoke to them, when was it?

348
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,196
- Was it yesterday?
- How were they then?

349
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,469
It's like a prison here.

350
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,231
Let's go home.

351
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,871
- The flight's paid for. It's not for five days.
- We could get another one.

352
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,952
Why do you want to go home?
Excuse me!

353
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,750
I can't believe it. He's coming.

354
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,836
Bringing the children with us would have
made all the difference. To me, anyway.

355
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,948
- Signore?
- A jug of water, please. With ice.

356
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,237
- Water?
- Um... coffee.

357
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,834
- Croissant? Eggs? Juice?
- No, just water.

358
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,959
- Let's go to the hotel and get water there.
- All right.

359
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,237
He's probably bringing it anyway.

360
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,634
I don't know why we came here.

361
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,388
We've been here before.
Why did we come again?

362
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,078
Actually, I remember why we came.

363
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,428
We thought we'd find out
what to do, didn't we?

364
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,234
What to do about you and me.

365
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,032
Well?

366
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,309
Have you found out?

367
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,997
I haven't. I just want to go home.
To my own bed and my kids.

368
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,551
Or maybe you have.

369
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,472
Maybe you have decided what you want.

370
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,831
What you want to do.

371
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,911
Have you?

372
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,268
No.

373
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,513
Oh, God. We should have
gone back to the hotel.

374
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,194
He's missed us.

375
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,231
My friends.

376
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,792
- How are you both?
- Terrible. We slept in the street.

377
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,871
Street?

378
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,430
- After we left you...
- We didn't have a map.

379
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,311
I'm horrified. It's entirely my fault. I kept
you late with wine and stupid stories.

380
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,631
- Don't scratch. It's not a question of that.
- It's my fault.

381
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,157
And it's my responsibility to correct it.
You must come to my house.

382
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,232
- Your coffee.
- <i>Senta. Lasci stare.</i>

383
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,311
No, we have a hotel.

384
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,872
My house is a thousand times
more comfortable, peaceful, serene.

385
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,870
We take a taxi.

386
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,868
Please.

387
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,514
- What do you think?
- All right.

388
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,191
The street!

389
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,035
- Where are we?
- Robert brought us here.

390
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,752
Robert. Where's he?

391
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,831
I don't know.

392
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,871
What time is it?

393
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,552
Evening.

394
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,948
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, wonderfully.

395
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,714
How's your bite?

396
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,950
It's gone.

397
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,110
Where's my watch?

398
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,990
Where's our clothes?

399
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,875
Have you seen them?

400
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,311
Not in there.

401
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,830
Not in here.

402
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,592
No?

403
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,352
Don't you think we ought to find them?

404
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,200
- I feel good.
- I must find out what's going on.

405
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,556
I just can't walk around here
stark bloody naked.

406
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,918
I think there's a dressing gown
hanging up in there.

407
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,989
I can't wear this. Look.

408
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,237
Yes, you can. You look lovely.

409
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,235
You look like a god.

410
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,476
I think I'm going to have to
take you to bed.

411
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,795
- This isn't a dressing gown, it's a nightie.
- You've no idea how good you feel in it.

412
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,395
I can't walk around a stranger's house
dressed like this.

413
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,675
Not with an erection!

414
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,751
Here. Put it on.

415
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,068
Find out what's going on.

416
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,271
How do I look?

417
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,390
Hello.

418
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,438
I'm Caroline, Robert's wife.

419
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,512
- Well, you're looking rested!
- Hello.

420
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,068
Come outside. It's nice.

421
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,718
- Wow!
- Mm.

422
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,874
It is beautiful, isn't it? I spend
as much time as possible out here.

423
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,236
- I'm Mary Kenway.
- Yes, I know.

424
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,238
- Come and sit down.
- Is this yours?

425
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,311
Yes.

426
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,152
I made it.

427
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,596
I sometimes sit out here
and do embroidery. I like embroidery.

428
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,796
It's lovely.

429
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,668
- Would you like a biscuit? Take one.
- Thanks.

430
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,316
You must be hungry. Robert wants you
to stay for dinner. He'll be back for dinner.

431
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,473
He's gone to his bar.
A new manager starts there tonight.

432
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,233
- <i>His</i> bar?
- Yes.

433
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,029
You were there last night, weren't you?

434
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,114
- He didn't say it was his bar.
- It's a kind of a hobby, I guess.

435
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,790
But you know more about it than I do.
I've never been there.

436
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,436
Have you done something to your back?

437
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,310
It helps to move. Sometimes
I just stand up and move about.

438
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,192
- Are you fond of your friend?
- Colin?

439
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,036
I hope you don't mind.
There's something I must tell you.

440
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,839
While you were both asleep
I came in and looked at you both.

441
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,916
I just sat on the chaise for half an hour.
I just sat there and looked at you both.

442
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,352
Oh.

443
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,433
Colin is very beautiful, isn't he?
Robert said he was.

444
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,514
You are too, of course.
You both have such wonderful skin.

445
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,317
Are you in love?

446
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,391
Well, I...

447
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,591
I do love him. I suppose.

448
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,513
Not quite like when we first met.

449
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,115
I trust him, really.
He's my closest friend.

450
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,998
But what do you mean by "in love"?

451
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,312
I mean that you'd do absolutely
anything for the other person.

452
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,518
And you'd let them do
absolutely anything to you.

453
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,511
Anything?

454
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,072
- If you're in love with somebody, you...
-

455
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,875
- Hello!
- Colin, this is Caroline, Robert's wife.

456
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,838
- Are you having a nice time?
- Um...

457
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,515
- On your holiday?
- Yes, except we keep getting lost.

458
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,591
Pull up a chair.

459
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,233
Oh, my God.

460
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,912
What?

461
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,472
Your clothes. I forgot.
I washed and dried them. I clean forgot.

462
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,551
I must tell you where they are.

463
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,632
But before I do you should tell him
what I told you.

464
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,838
- What?
- What I did while you were both asleep.

465
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,115
Oh. Right.

466
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,592
Caroline came in and looked at us
both whilst we were asleep.

467
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,398
Oh, did she?

468
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,312
Yes.

469
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,553
You were so peaceful.
Just like a baby.

470
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,714
- Babies can be very ratty in their sleep.
- Oh, no, not him.

471
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,669
- I'm sure he always sleeps sweetly.
- Yes, but I'm not a baby.

472
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,038
I never said you were.
I only said that you slept like a baby.

473
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,956
Now, listen. Robert is very keen for you
to stay and have dinner with us.

474
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,715
He told me not to let you
have your clothes till you agreed.

475
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,628
You must be starving, anyway.

476
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,556
So you will?

477
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,396
- Well, I...
- Oh, please. If you don't, he'll blame me.

478
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,278
-  Let's stay.
- Oh, good.

479
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,992
And... now can I have my clothes?

480
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,116
They're locked in your
bathroom cupboard. Here's the key.

481
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,078
- Thanks.
- Just through there.

482
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,635
Isn't it sweet when men are shy?

483
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,597
It's so sweet.

484
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,240
Tell me, what do you do?
Do you work?

485
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:56,111
Well, I mainly do voice-overs these days.
Commercials.

486
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,749
I was with a women's group
until about six months ago.

487
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,310
- What do you mean, a women's group?
- A theatre group.

488
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,918
You're an actress?
What a beautiful thing that must be.

489
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,436
Well, sometimes.
Anyway, the group broke up, so...

490
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,637
Women. It was all women?

491
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,515
Some of us wanted to bring in men and
the rest of them wanted to keep it pure.

492
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,591
That's what broke us up.

493
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:30,152
How can you do a play with only women?
I mean, what could happen?

494
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,710
Happen? Well, you...

495
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,713
You could have a play about
two women who have only just met

496
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,475
sitting on a balcony talking.

497
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,394
- But they'd probably be waiting for a man.
-

498
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,076
And then he'd come.
And then something <i>would</i> happen.

499
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,872
- It hurts when I laugh.
- Can I do anything?

500
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,952
Would you touch me here on my neck?

501
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,429
There. Press it.

502
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,670
No, harder.

503
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,479
Yeah. That's it, thank you.

504
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,474
- We did an all-women <i>Hamlet</i> once.
- <i>Hamlet?</i>

505
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,432
I've never read that play. In fact, I haven't
seen a play since I was at school.

506
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,516
Isn't that the one with the ghost,
and then everybody dies at the end?

507
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,353
- Were you the star?
- No.

508
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,431
- Hello.
- Hello.

509
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,432
- Have you slept well?
- Wonderfully.

510
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,114
- What an apartment.
- I'll get the glasses.

511
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,794
It belonged to my grandfather.

512
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,951
You see that island?

513
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:58,596
That's Cemetery Island. My grandfather
and my father are both buried there.

514
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,516
- You're staying for dinner, I trust?
- I'll get dressed.

515
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,948
A glass of champagne first.

516
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,037
Carolina!

517
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,271
Thank you.

518
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,869
You look like an ángel.

519
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,150
How are you feeling?

520
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,673
Better.

521
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,751
To Colin and Mary.

522
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,718
- Dinner.
- I'd better get dressed.

523
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,031
Thank you.

524
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,230
Beautiful place.

525
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,875
These books are the favourite
literature of my father.

526
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,996
And my grandfather.

527
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,071
All first editions.

528
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,271
These are things my father
used every day. Small things.

529
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,309
- He used opera glasses every day?
- No. He used opera glasses at the opera.

530
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,078
They belonged to my grandfather.

531
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:09,240
Your father seems to be...
very important to you.

532
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,279
My father and his father
understood themselves clearly.

533
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,148
They were men
and they were proud of their sex.

534
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,276
Women understood them too.

535
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,751
Now women treat men like children
because they can't take them seriously,

536
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,994
but men like my father and grandfather
women took very seriously.

537
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,073
There was no uncertainty.
No confusion.

538
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,592
So.

539
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,269
This is a museum.
Dedicated to the good old days, hm?

540
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,430
So, how is England?
Lovely, dear old England?

541
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,876
Hampshire, Wiltshire,
Cumberland, Yorkshire?

542
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,473
Harrods?

543
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,470
Such a beautiful country.
Such beautiful traditions.

544
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,838
Well, it's not quite so beautiful now.
Is it, Colin?

545
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,517
- Colin, are you feeling all right?
- Mm.

546
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,797
In what way?
In what way not beautiful?

547
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,557
Oh...

548
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,153
I don't know.

549
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,674
Freedom. You know?

550
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,719
Freedom? What kind of freedom?
Freedom to do what?

551
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,870
- Freedom to be free.
- You want to be free?

552
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,918
- Free to do what?
- You don't believe in it?

553
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,949
Sure I believe in it, but sometimes
a few rules, you know, not a bad thing.

554
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,593
First, society has to be protected
from perverts. Everybody knows that.

555
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,357
My position is simple. Put them all
up against the wall and shoot them.

556
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,318
What society needs to do is purify itself.

557
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,517
The English government's
going in the right direction.

558
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,717
We could learn a lot of lessons from them.

559
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,954
I'm an Englishman, and I have to say I
disagree violently with what you just said.

560
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,076
I think it's shit.

561
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:59,352
I respect you as an English man.
But not if you're a communist poof.

562
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,392
You're not a poof, are you?

563
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,472
It's the right word, no? Or is it fruit?

564
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,357
Talking about fruit, it's time for coffee.

565
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,716
- No, I think we should be going.
- Yes, we must.

566
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,190
- But coffee!
- No, we've stayed far too long already.

567
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,397
- But thank you so much.
- You're tired.

568
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,038
Thank you.

569
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,910
Our hotel won't seem quite the same
after your apartment.

570
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,550
Oh.

571
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,312
Nice.

572
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,789
I'm a keen amateur photographer.

573
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,236
- So we go straight on till we get to the...
- Take the bridge.

574
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,552
Please. Please come back.
Please. It's important.

575
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,710
I can't get out.

576
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,315
- Love to.
- It's my back. The stairs.

577
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,549
Anyway, thank you so much
for your kindness. Good night.

578
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,639
- It's meant a great deal to us.
- Good night.

579
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,510
You know, when I saw you on that
terrace tonight, in that nightdress...

580
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,475
you looked so beautiful...

581
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,478
my heart... jumped.

582
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,710
But I told you how you looked
in that nightdress, didn't I?

583
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,357
- <i> Permesso.</i>
-  Oh, please!

584
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,433
- <i>Dovrei pulire la stanza.</i>
-  We're on our bloody holiday.

585
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,677
Come here. Come here.

586
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,471
What's it like?

587
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,031
I often wonder what it feels like.

588
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,111
What's what like?

589
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,957
What's it feel like to be the girl?
I mean the feeling of being...

590
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,555
It feels...

591
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,437
like...

592
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,952
this.

593
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,875
<i> I'm crazy about you.</i>

594
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,429
<i> I'm crazy about you.</i>

595
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,789
Don't open the shutters.

596
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,711
Come here.

597
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,911
Come here.

598
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,671
Sit down.

599
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,309
Ow!

600
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,356
- I want you.
- No.

601
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,829
No? Yes.

602
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,512
No.

603
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,234
- Wasn't that maid extraordinary?
-  Listen.

604
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,311
Why did they do that to you, those kids?
Why did they hound you out of that gang?

605
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,394
Because they didn't like me.

606
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:15,031
They were jealous, that's what it was.
They were jealous of your beauty.

607
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,395
I am myself.
You know that, don't you?

608
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,029
I'm... jealous of your beauty.

609
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,669
In that it belongs to me.
Jealous in that sense.

610
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,836
No one else can touch it. It's all mine.

611
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,911
Is it?

612
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,714
All mine. It's my possession.

613
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,634
- I'm possessed!
- <i>Avete visto quei due inglesi?</i>

614
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,517
Colin.

615
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,919
What?

616
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,709
- <i>È carino.</i>
- <i>Anche lei è molto bella.</i>

617
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,189
You know what those people are doing?

618
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,714
- What?
- They're talking about us.

619
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,439
- About you.
- No, you.

620
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,474
- Or perhaps us.
-

621
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,554
This actually reminds me. You know
all this thing about thighs and bottoms?

622
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,995
- What thing?
- You know.

623
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,596
People look at other people's thighs and
bottoms and say "Christ, what thighs!"

624
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,390
Or "What an arse!" "What an ass."
"What tits", of course.

625
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,876
What tits, what boobs, what a can.
If you see what I mean.

626
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,155
I mean, what I mean is...

627
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,629
Well, my first point is that
only the word "thighs" is constant.

628
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,111
You've got all these other words for all
the other words but only one for thighs.

629
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,876
- Isn't that incredible?
- You don't need another word.

630
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,712
- What's your question?
- This.

631
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:57,478
When people look at you and... talk about
your thighs and your bottom, or both,

632
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:03,157
what sense of your thighs and your
bottom do you at such a time have?

633
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,471
People aren't talking about
my thighs or my bottom.

634
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,028
How can you know that?

635
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:17,632
Because the whole restaurant is talking
about your thighs and your bottom.

636
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,917
Mine? No, I don't think so.

637
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,598
Really?

638
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,840
- Incredible.
-

639
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,509
Oh.

640
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,114
- I forgot to tell you.
- What?

641
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,350
I had rather a good idea.

642
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,074
I'm going to hire a surgeon.

643
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,468
A very handsome surgeon.

644
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,959
- To cut off your arms and your legs.
- Oh, really?

645
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:05,115
And I'll keep you in a room in my house.
And use you just for sex.

646
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,794
Whenever I feel like it.

647
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,229
And sometimes
I'll lend you to my girlfriends

648
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,278
and they can do what they like with you.

649
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,828
It's funny you should say that.

650
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,196
I've come to a decision myself
and I haven't told you yet.

651
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,910
- A decision?
- Mm. I've come to this decision.

652
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,594
- What is it?
- Well...

653
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,751
I'm going to invent a machine.

654
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,470
Made of steel. Powered by electricity.

655
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,270
- It has controls, pistons...
- Mmm...

656
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,912
It has straps, dials.
And it makes a low hum. Like this.

657
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,032
Like that?

658
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,112
And the machine will fuck you.

659
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:03,438
Not just for hours and days, but for years
and years and years and years.

660
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,237
Forever.

661
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,112
Mary.

662
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,192
You were having a nightmare. Mary.

663
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,631
What is it?

664
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,111
What is it?

665
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,995
You were having a terrible dream.
What is it?

666
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,111
You are beautiful.

667
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,117
- Are you awake?
- I'm so afraid.

668
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,189
Shh.

669
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,271
What is it?

670
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,356
Touch me.

671
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,475
Shh.

672
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,439
Come on. Let's go back.
Come on. Let's sit down.

673
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,194
What is it? You had a terrible dream.

674
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,032
- Do you remember it?
- Mm.

675
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,395
Tell me. What was it?

676
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,871
There was a photograph
at Robert's apartment.

677
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,748
It was of you.

678
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,434
What photograph?

679
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,877
I looked through some photographs
at Robert's apartment.

680
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,349
One of them was of you.

681
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,991
Of me?

682
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:14,438
It must have been taken from outside.
From a boat or along the waterfront.

683
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,353
You were standing on this balcony.

684
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,116
- But I didn't see any photograph.
- No, you didn't see it.

685
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,835
- Don't fall asleep. Keep awake.
- I'm awake.

686
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,114
You're in his photograph.

687
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,552
Colin?

688
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,117
- What about over there?
- All right.

689
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,191
Come on.

690
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,238
Something happened at Robert's flat.
I didn't tell you.

691
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,713
- I can't hear you. What?
- Something happened. I didn't tell you.

692
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,475
When you'd gone to change, to dress.
Remember?

693
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,272
Well, he was talking to me.

694
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,279
About his father and so on.

695
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,911
And then suddenly he hit me
really hard in the stomach.

696
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,998
- He totally winded me.
- He hit you?

697
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,231
But why?

698
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,350
Why didn't you say anything?

699
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,671
I don't know.

700
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,709
I don't know why I didn't say anything.

701
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,394
I don't know why he hit me.

702
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:00,433
And I don't know why he took
my photograph on the balcony, either.

703
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,191
I'm going for a swim.

704
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,391
Listen.

705
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,675
I've been thinking.

706
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,236
Why don't we do it?

707
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,629
- Do what?
- Get together.

708
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,670
You know.

709
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,070
Live together with the children.

710
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,151
I mean it.

711
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,511
I love you.

712
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,279
Yes, but we don't have to
commit ourselves to all that. I mean...

713
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,998
It's been such a lovely day.

714
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,070
Don't you want to?
I thought you wanted to.

715
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,274
I do, but... when I was swimming
out there and I was all alone,

716
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,318
I suddenly felt so... peaceful.

717
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,480
I can't describe it.

718
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,279
I could have gone on forever.

719
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,956
I can't get back to things like this
just like that.

720
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,669
I thought you wanted it.

721
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,875
We'll see, shall we?

722
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,755
It goes around the other side of the island,
then cuts through the harbour to our side.

723
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,831
Let's take it, then.

724
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,633
We can get off at the next stop
and walk through.

725
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,190
- What?
- We can get off and walk through.

726
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,592
- Quicker than going round the harbour.
- Possibly.

727
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,272
Yes.

728
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,394
See where we are?

729
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,392
Colin! Mary! Hi!

730
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,038
Hi!

731
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,914
Come up!

732
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,513
Come on up!

733
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:25,594
- Do you want to go up?
- She's seen us. Can't very well be rude.

734
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,948
- Just across the canal, please. Over there.
- <i> Grazie.</i>

735
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,073
- Hello.
- Hello.

736
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,754
How delightful to see you.

737
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:04,836
The boat brought us round this side from
the beach, so we thought we'd say hello.

738
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,158
We were expecting you sooner.

739
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,038
- You got my message?
- No. When?

740
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,715
I left a message at your hotel today.
We're going away, you see.

741
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,837
- We didn't want to miss you.
- No, we didn't get it.

742
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,912
But you came anyway. How wonderful.

743
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,470
Going away?

744
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,471
To Canada.

745
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,714
To see my family, so we wanted
to say goodbye. Have a farewell drink.

746
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,712
Give Mary some refreshment.
I have to go to my bar.

747
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,917
I have business. Very quick.
Will you come with me?

748
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,355
- I'll just...
- We won't be long.

749
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,238
- Colin, I...
- Have you been swimming?

750
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,912
Yes.

751
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,431
Good God.

752
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,593
- I thought you were going on holiday.
- We're selling up.

753
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,390
We are going on holiday, but when we get
back we'll buy a ground-floor apartment.

754
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,550
- That's what I need.
- Oh.

755
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,108
- Would you like some herb tea?
- I'd love some.

756
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:37,358
- <i>Ciao, Robert.</i>
- <i>Dove andate? Venite con noi.</i>

757
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,357
- Somebody just pinched me.
- Venetians are very friendly people.

758
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,431
This way.

759
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,155
Robert said he told you
about his childhood.

760
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:23,076
He exaggerates, you know. He turns
his past into stories to tell at the bar.

761
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,832
- No sugar for me.
- I'm just stirring in the lemon.

762
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,708
- Shall we take it out onto the terrace?
- May I?

763
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,719
What happened to your back?

764
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,433
<i>Sì, certo. È come hanno detto.</i>

765
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,432
<i>Esattamente. Sì, sì, ho capito.</i>

766
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,034
<i>Grazie. Allora posso stare tranquillo.</i>

767
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,270
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

768
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,955
<i>L'avvocato dice che il contratto è perfetto.</i>

769
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:20,634
Did you understand what I was
telling people as we walked here?

770
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,919
No.

771
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,389
I was telling them that...

772
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:32,796
you're my lover, and that Caroline
is jealous because she likes you too.

773
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,430
- Why did you tell them that?
- Why "why"?

774
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,795
We knew you would come back.

775
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,350
Now, look here, Robert.
Hang on a minute.

776
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,475
Why did you take that picture of me?
The one you showed Mary?

777
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,510
- She's very quick.
- What was the point?

778
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,150
I'm selling the bar.

779
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,958
To him.

780
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,870
I've never told anyone this - never -
but I want to tell you.

781
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:26,797
Soon after we were married, Robert
started to hurt me when we made love.

782
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:33,194
I tried to stop him, but he went on doing it.
And after a time, I found I liked it.

783
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:40,834
Not the pain itself, but somehow...
the fact of being helpless before it.

784
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,114
Being reduced to nothing by it.

785
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,873
And of being punished,
therefore being guilty.

786
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,075
I felt it was right that I should be punished.

787
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,071
I thrilled to it.

788
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:05,153
It took us over totally.
It grew and grew. It seemed never-ending.

789
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,912
But there was an end to it.
We both knew what it was.

790
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:20,358
That waiter was once a fisherman.

791
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:25,833
But pollution has ruined the fish.
So fishermen become waiters.

792
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,388
Why did you take my picture?
What does it mean?

793
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:43,595
You see that barbershop? My grandfather
and my father used that barbershop.

794
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,274
And I use that barbershop.

795
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,310
That's Cemetery Island.

796
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,955
My back happened suddenly one night.
It was very bad indeed.

797
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:08,637
And there was an incompetent surgeon.
So I'm like this.

798
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,720
He's terribly strong, you see.

799
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:18,920
When he bent my head backwards
I blacked out with the pain,

800
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,870
but I remember thinking
"It's going to happen. Now."

801
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,112
"There's no going back on it.
It's going to happen now."

802
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,317
"This is it. This is the end."

803
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,238
I'm boring you.

804
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,314
No, not at all. It's the...

805
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,472
It's the sun, I think. The long swim.

806
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:52,115
Do you and Colin do strange things?

807
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,359
Oh, no, I don't think so. No.

808
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,474
Oh, I'm sure Colin does.

809
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,034
In fact, I'm certain he does.

810
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,634
I want to show you something.

811
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,710
- A bit dizzy.
- I must show you something.

812
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,350
You haven't been in our bedroom,
have you?

813
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,831
My legs ache.

814
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,437
God!

815
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,511
He's so beautiful.

816
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,148
Robert saw you both
the first day you arrived.

817
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,872
That was the first picture I saw of him.

818
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,872
I'll never forget it.
Robert came home so excited.

819
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,952
And then he brought
more and more photographs home.

820
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,554
We became so close.

821
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,835
Incredibly close.

822
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,832
Colin brought us together.

823
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:38,517
It was my idea to put him on the wall
so we could see him as we made love.

824
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,152
I took that one myself. Isn't it brilliant?

825
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:47,392
- Why?
- And then Robert brought you home.

826
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,998
It was as if God was in on our dream.

827
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:58,269
I knew fantasy was passing into reality.
Have you ever experienced that?

828
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,272
It's like stepping into a mirror.

829
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,918
Colin.

830
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,594
Colin.

831
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,911
- Wake up. Wake up.
-

832
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,594
Colin and Robert are back.

833
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,798
Do you know where we are now?

834
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,231
Shall I tell you?

835
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,950
We are on the other side of the mirror.

836
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,590
Mary, what is it?

837
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,795
Mary?

838
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,950
What is it?

839
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:58,511
What's the matter?
Mary. What's the matter?

840
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,992
Cheers.

841
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,518
- It's just a mild touch of sunstroke.
- She's not hot.

842
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,508
What is it? Is it sunstroke?

843
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,909
Tell me. Try to tell me.

844
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,991
Tell me!

845
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,637
- She's just tired.
- C...

846
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,917
Are trying to say my name?

847
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,958
- Co...
- What are you trying to say?

848
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,395
- Co...
- Cold.

849
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,674
- She's cold.
- We shouldn't crowd her.

850
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,116
She needs a doctor.
Where's the telephone?

851
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,395
It's been disconnected.

852
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,756
- Disconnected?
- We're going away.

853
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,637
You must know a doctor.

854
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,151
Go and fetch a fucking doctor.
She's very ill!

855
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,557
- No need to shout.
- She'll be fine.

856
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,068
Mary understands.

857
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,194
You understand too, don't you?

858
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,999
You understand.
You do understand, don't you?

859
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,870
Don't you know where you are? Get up!

860
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,271
Don't move.

861
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,079
You've cut my lip.

862
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,472
Shh!

863
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,828
What have you done to Mary?

864
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,070
I'll do anything you want.
Just get a doctor for her.

865
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,038
- What do you want?
- Want?

866
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:45,237
I'll show you what we want.

867
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,515
I'll show you.

868
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,071
We'll show you.

869
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,357
Carolina.

870
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,237
Roberto.

871
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:31,194
<i> What did you want</i>
<i>from these people? I ask you again.</i>

872
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,432
What did you want from these people?

873
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,349
Nothing. They were friends.

874
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,231
Friends?

875
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,595
We had dinner there.

876
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,838
Why did you go back with your boyfriend
to these people?

877
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,439
What did you want from them?

878
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:05,392
Did your boyfriend like the woman?

879
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,552
I liked her. I don't think that he...

880
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,918
Did your boyfriend like the man?

881
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,189
No. No, he didn't.

882
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,350
And you?

883
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,910
You liked the man?

884
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,310
- Did you like the man?
- No.

885
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:32,111
So, why did you go to dinner?
And why did you go back?

886
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,591
Why did you come to Venice?
What were you looking for?

887
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:42,348
- Nothing, we ju...
- Were you looking for... some fun?

888
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,151
We were...

889
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,434
We were going to get married.

890
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:03,033
Is this the body of Colin Mayhew?

891
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:08,151
Sign here.

892
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,876
- Combed his hair the wrong way.
- Sorry?

893
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,875
It doesn't go this way.

894
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,431
It goes this way.

895
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,633
...a tourist, but now
you plan everything in advance.

896
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:47,113
You sell your bar, you sell your apartment,
you buy drug, and so on and so on.

897
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:51,318
And then on the other hand you leave
your razor with your fingerprints,

898
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:57,748
you book a ticket under your own name
and you travel with your own passport.

899
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,717
We don't get it.

900
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,473
Listen. Let me tell you something.

901
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,678
My father was a very big man.

902
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,434
All his life he wore a black moustache.

903
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,638
When it turned grey
he used a little brush to keep it black,

904
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:19,076
such as ladies use for their eyes.

905
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,151
Mascara.
