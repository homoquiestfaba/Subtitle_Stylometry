1
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,240
Adam and
I were like brothers

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,040
best friends
since nursery school.

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
We grew up in the city

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,320
and spent our summers at
his parents' country house

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
in Stockbridge.

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,240
His dad used to say we were
like two olives in a martini.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
But we weren't.

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Not really.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
Adam was always the golden boy

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,800
a kid destined for everything.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,000
When I think about
that day at the tower

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
sometimes I wonder
if I'd actually paid attention

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
to what he was saying

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,720
really paid attention

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
but, maybe he was reaching out.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
But I doubt it.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,920
I mean, in all the time
I knew him, I never saw him cry

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,040
even after the accident
with his eye when we were kids.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
He had such a strong will.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,120
You kind of got used to the idea
that nothing could hurt him.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
But I never
had any sense that...

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,760
well, maybe I did
somewhere down deep, because

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,440
when I woke up it was like
I knew what had happened.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,600
I just knew it.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Adam!

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,360
After 8th
grade the Ad-man and I

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,560
were both packed off
to boarding school at Andover.

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
Four years of cold
showers and tuna casserole.

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Christmas break was
always a long time coming.

30
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,040
We piled out shit into my
500 dollar Chrysler New Yorker

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,720
it home to the city.

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,280
I got a letter
from Columbia yesterday.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Really?

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
Told my dad not to open it.

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
You have a
heightened sense of drama.

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,760
I don't like
people opening my mail.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,160
OK, you just make
yourself comfortable.

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll drive, you relax.

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,320
Shut up and drive.

40
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,240
Think my dad's having an affair.

41
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Why do you say that?

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,960
He's acting weird.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,600
He's got a little
attitude on him.

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
What do you mean?

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
Hard to explain,
it's just kind of a vibe.

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
A vibe?

47
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
What's that based on?

48
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,480
Dude, it's not the first time.

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Really?

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Yeah.

51
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
What about your mom?

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
-What about her?
-Does she know?

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,240
She has to know.

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
And?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,240
It's not something she's
going to talk about, obviously.

56
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Not to me, anyway.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Actually, not to anyone.

58
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,920
That's fucked-up.

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,240
-What?
-Your dad doing that.

60
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
You serious?

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,080
Yeah, I'm serious.

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,160
Guy's been married for...

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
thirty years.

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
So?

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
So?

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,240
You have sex with the
same woman for thirty years?

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
You married her.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
What's that mean?

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,440
I think it means something.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
Well, I guess they
should stay together

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,440
so they don't rock
your little fantasy world.

72
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
It's sad.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,720
Adam got
into Columbia, of course

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,320
and through some clerical
error or something, so did I.

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,040
We were both back on home turf.

76
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,760
Yeah Beat Pub
on 10th and Broadway

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,880
was our official hangout.

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,320
That was where we met Nina.

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Belushi croaked.

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
No.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Mad, huh?

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,520
Hey, check out this waitress.

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
She's got a nice ass.

84
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,520
Nice ass, she so
transcends nice ass.

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,240
-I'll be with you in a second.
-OK.

86
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,800
She's all right.

87
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Philistine.

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
What can I get you?

89
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
I'll have
Jack Daniel's on the rocks

90
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,440
and a cheese
burger, medium rare.

91
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
Oh, a health nut.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Hey, you know Belushi died?

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Oh, wow.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,200
You won't let that
happen to me, will you?

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
No, never.

96
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,600
-You OK?
-Yeah.

97
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
God...

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Not bad.

99
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Not my type.

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Not bad.

101
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
You're insane.

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
You see her eyes?

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,320
The ponytail,
those perfect little wrists.

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,040
She's so fucking cute.

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,960
I could fall
deeply in love with her.

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
I am deeply in love with her.

107
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
Hey. Not my type.

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Yeah. I've heard.

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,880
Listen, I'll give you
your whole biography, OK?

110
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,520
Dances at the Quag Feudal Club.

111
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Must I continue?

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Tennis. Horses.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,040
Oh, and lots of
James Taylor, definitely.

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
That why she's working here?

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,080
because Daddy wants her to get
in touch with the common man.

116
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,760
-One Jack D on the rocks.
-Thanks.

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,280
-Hey, listen. I have a question.
-Uhuh?

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Are you on the swim team?

119
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Yeah.

120
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
Hundred meter butterfly. Why?

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll be right back
with your cheese burger.

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,840
You're such a prick.

123
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Oh.

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,920
You just process
her, just like that.

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,560
Come on, you've got to
admit, she's a touch removed.

126
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm sorry she's not
some chain-smoking Euro-fag.

127
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,120
Cover me, I'm going in.

128
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,400
Digging your own grave.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,600
We lived in Kansas.

130
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,960
And carved our
names into a tree.

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
And a big heart around it.

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Got any keys?

133
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
-Keys...
-Uhuh.

134
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
OK.

135
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
They'll send me
to Riker's for this.

136
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Fifteen.

137
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
One, two, three, four, five.

138
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,840
Fifteen across and five down.

139
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,160
-Five across?
-No.

140
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,960
Fifteen across and five down.

141
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,920
-Do you know what?
-What?

142
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,480
I'm always gonna
be here to remind you.

143
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
Would you read to me?

144
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,800
He woke when it was
barely just light enough

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,080
to see the pine trunks.

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
And he left the bed

147
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
careful not
to wake Catherine.

148
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
No, Hemingway.

149
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,280
...found his shorts

150
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
and went

151
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,760
The Peloponnesians, however

152
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,920
having spent
the time up until midday

153
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,920
laying waste the land

154
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
-sailed away again.
-No!

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,240
At about nightfall were
informed by fire signals.

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
One fine day

157
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,240
Poo had stomped up
to the top of the forest

158
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
to see if his
friend Christopher Robin

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
was interested in bears at all.

160
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes.

161
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
At breakfast that morning

162
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
a simple meal

163
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
of marmalade spread lightly
over a honeycomb or two...

164
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Hello?

165
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Nina.

166
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Ben?

167
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Yes.

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Come on up.

169
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,840
-Sorry.
-Hi. Come in.

170
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,280
Where's the Man?

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Oh, he went, uhh...

172
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,600
he went to
Concord for the weekend.

173
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,320
He's interviewing
that guy for his thesis.

174
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,360
Shit, I totally forgot
that that was this weekend.

175
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Oh god.

176
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I'm sorry, I'm gonna take off.

177
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Hey.

178
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,960
Hey, Ben, why don't
you hang out for a while?

179
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm just studying
for my mid-terms.

180
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
I could do with a break.

181
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,920
-You sure?
-Yeah.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Come on, sit down.

183
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,960
Mind if I have a drink?

184
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Of course not.

185
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,240
I don't actually know
what we've got, though.

186
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
You want anything?

187
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah. Sure.

188
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,280
Think I've got
some wine in the fridge.

189
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
What are we drinking to?

190
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
How about celibacy?

191
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,240
Ben, it won't last long.

192
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Yeah, it will.

193
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,440
I don't need this shit.

194
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Ben, are you OK?

195
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,000
How much have you had to drink?

196
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
There.

197
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
A little better.

198
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,480
Time to hit the streets.

199
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,480
Have you had anything to eat?

200
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,840
Could I make you
something to eat?

201
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Scrambled eggs.

202
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
Toast. Would you eat that?

203
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm fine.

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Ben.

205
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,880
I'm, I'm gonna go.

206
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Ben. Sit down.

207
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Ben, sit down.

208
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Eggs l'Awesome.

209
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,920
This is a time-honored

210
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,040
family recipe.

211
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,040
And there is one

212
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,320
crucial, but
controversial ingredient

213
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,160
which is, mushrooms.

214
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,560
Are you OK with mushrooms, Ben?

215
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
I don't understand how
you do that. I fucking just...

216
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,280
Just take off with a

217
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
note taped to the
fucking refrigerator...

218
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,040
Would you do that?

219
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I'm serious.

220
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Would you do that?

221
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,840
Would you ever do that?

222
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
No.

223
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,560
She was very unhappy, Ben.

224
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,400
She was an unhappy person.

225
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,720
Together, you were unhappy, too.

226
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,680
Yeah? What am I now?

227
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
I feel like an ass.

228
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,440
Oh. No.

229
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
No, no.

230
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,960
You have every right
to feel the way you do.

231
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,560
I swear, all I want is
a normal relationship, you know?

232
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,600
I mean, is it too
much to fucking ask?

233
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,640
Just got to
find the right person.

234
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,280
Is Adam your right person?

235
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Yeah.

236
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Yeah, definitely.

237
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,680
I don't know if you...

238
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,120
know this, but...

239
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,920
I didn't really
like you at first.

240
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,760
Yeah. I kinda
got that impression.

241
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
What, he told you?

242
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
No.

243
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,200
No, Adam always told
me how much you liked me.

244
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,200
I was a jerk, but...

245
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,560
Adam's lucky.

246
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,800
Oh, are you making yourself all
pretty for Ben's new girlfriend?

247
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
I should meet the woman

248
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
he spends the
rest of his life with.

249
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Ergo

250
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,520
the woman we spend
the rest of our lives with.

251
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,480
That's rather
momentous, wouldn't you say?

252
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Huh.

253
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,760
No, you don't think that
you're just putting a little

254
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,760
a little bit too much
pressure on this girl?

255
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,640
She could be the one.

256
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I sense it.

257
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Hmm.

258
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,040
What is this music?

259
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,720
Adam sent it to me. I
realize I never listened to it.

260
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,520
A little last-minute cramming?

261
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
Shh, don't tell him.

262
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,640
It's pretty weird.

263
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,240
Is he weird?

264
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,000
I met Kat at Stanford Law

265
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,400
the first school
I'd ever attended

266
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,680
without Adam as a classmate.

267
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
He and Nina had gotten married

268
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,600
and started
spending a lot of time

269
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
up at his
parents' country house.

270
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,520
This is scary. I'm being
thrown in at the deep end.

271
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,440
You guys have all known
each other for so long.

272
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I love you.

273
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
That's good.

274
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
That's all that matters.

275
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Give me a kiss.

276
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,560
Whew. Oh, those
New England winters.

277
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
-Hey.
-Hey.

278
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,520
If it isn't John
Cheever himself.

279
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,320
-Made it.
-Hey, how're you doing?

280
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,360
-How are you?
-Good to see you, buddy.

281
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
Kat! I'm Nina.

282
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
I feel like I know
you guys already.

283
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,880
Ben talked about you
uhh, well... constantly.

284
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
That much,
bored the crap out of you.

285
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,480
-Kat, the Ad-man.
-Hey, welcome.

286
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
-Hey, sweetie.

287
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,120
We're absolutely
thrilled to meet you.

288
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Thanks.

289
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,680
She's too good
for the likes of you.

290
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,200
What do you know?
You just met her.

291
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
I can tell.

292
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,040
-You have a good drive up?
-Oh yeah.

293
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
-Yeah.
-Beautiful.

294
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Yeah.

295
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,680
Carry inside, people.

296
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,840
-You drink, I trust?
-A little.

297
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
We'll see about that.

298
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
Don't worry about it, I got it.

299
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Place is great.

300
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,640
We'll grow on you, I promise.

301
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,800
He's attractive.

302
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Huh?

303
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Adam.

304
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,240
He's very attractive, I can
see why women would like him.

305
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,120
Well, Nina was his
first serious girlfriend.

306
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Really?

307
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Yeah.

308
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,680
I mean, I guess he fooled around
with girls at Andover, but...

309
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,960
yeah, Nina was
his first real love.

310
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
He was a virgin?

311
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Yep.

312
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,160
-That's great.
-Yeah.

313
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,840
Can't believe that.
That's so romantic.

314
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Hmm.

315
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
What?

316
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
I don't know. It's...

317
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,160
He's never been hurt.

318
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
I mean, never. He's never

319
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,240
developed any kind of

320
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
like emotional scar
tissue or anything.

321
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,480
Why is that so important?

322
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,760
I don't know, I mean...

323
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,040
in an ideal world,
it isn't I suppose.

324
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
What are you, a jaded stud?

325
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,440
Hey, been around, you know.

326
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
-Could have fooled me.
-Oh yeah?

327
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
-Yup.
-Let me show you.

328
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,560
You never told me
he had an eyepatch.

329
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Oh.

330
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,880
-Sure I did.
-No, you didn't.

331
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What happened?

332
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Umm...

333
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,240
We got hold of
a bottle rocket, one

334
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,360
Fourth of July, and

335
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I lit it, but

336
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,800
he was leaning over it...

337
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,320
God, how old were you?

338
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Seven.

339
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
How come you never told me?

340
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,080
I could have sworn I did.

341
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,000
You poor baby.
That must have been awful.

342
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,080
I never saw him cry.

343
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
Kat, they would
wear long black coats

344
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,680
and I gotta tell you
they looked ridiculous.

345
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Uhuh.

346
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
What do you mean

347
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,200
we looked ridiculous?

348
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,560
What about your
little uniform, Missy?

349
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
The, the...

350
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
suede clogs and
the perfect jeans.

351
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,280
Brooks Brothers shirt

352
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
rich girl slumming
at Unique Boutique.

353
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,040
Oh, and what?
You spent your summers

354
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,720
selling potatoes
from a horse-drawn...

355
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,840
That's right! I walked 25 miles

356
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,360
through snow over
mountains for my education.

357
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,960
Nothing came to me.

358
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeah, my friends and I
used to walk through Palo Alto

359
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
in these, uhh... uhh...

360
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,360
in these tie-dyed
peasant dresses

361
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,200
-No. Lighter.
-Listening to the dead.

362
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,920
-You were a dead-head?
-...dancing girls.

363
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,120
I can't imagine that.

364
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,920
-It was awful.
-Oh, she's wild.

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,880
All photos from that
period should be destroyed.

366
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,760
Nina hated me back then.

367
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,720
Oh. Oh, you're right.

368
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,080
Kat, it was the
other way around.

369
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,480
You see, Ben thought that I was
stealing his little playmate.

370
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,040
What do you mean? You were the
Yoko Ono of Columbia University.

371
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Oh!

372
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
My little Yoko.

373
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,520
Thank you.

374
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,680
And then we had
this very bonding moment.

375
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,800
Nina was very kind to
me in an hour of need.

376
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,160
I made you eggs.

377
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,800
You made me eggs,
Eggs l'Awesome.

378
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
Uhuh.

379
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
And you were so sad.

380
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
Oh man, I was so pathetic.

381
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
Don't tell me, don't tell me

382
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,840
don't tell me it's
the famous Emily moment.

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,120
And then...

384
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,720
this asshole, this asshole
writes a one-act play about it.

385
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,200
I write what I know.

386
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,600
Yeah, nothing's so painful that
Adam Miller can't exploit it

387
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,240
-for his own personal gain.
-Hey.

388
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,680
-Careful.
-This from a law student.

389
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
But on top of it,
the fucking thing wins the...

390
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
the drama prize

391
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,840
and is performed in front
of 200 people or something

392
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,720
-look at my life...
-I changed the names.

393
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah, you changed the names.

394
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,440
-I became Ken.
-

395
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,120
It was really beautiful.

396
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
People wept.

397
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,560
-Yeah, I wept.
-They didn't.

398
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,160
What was wrong
with those colors?

399
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,800
It happened. We were
two happening silhouettes.

400
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Just carved it.

401
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,600
Can I... can I see it?

402
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
See what?

403
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,720
Your dick, what do you think?

404
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,880
Hey, who needs a beer?

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,360
-Go on.
-Are you sure?

406
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
Are you sure you can handle it?

407
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Yeah, I want to see it.

408
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,800
Gaze into the abyss.

409
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,080
Ben uhh, never told me.

410
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,880
Everyone else
felt so sorry for me.

411
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
I always felt
kind of sorry for him.

412
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,160
Everything that happens in life

413
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,160
people always want
to blame somebody.

414
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Mm.

415
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,840
But it could have been the
other way around so easily.

416
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,720
So you weren't
pissed off, Adam?

417
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
It was an accident.

418
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,040
And he's still
carrying it around.

419
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
You saw the way
that he disappeared

420
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
when you brought it up?

421
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Mm.

422
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
It's sad.

423
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
What are you gonna do?

424
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I like her.

425
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
-Yeah?
-Uhuh.

426
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
She's nice.

427
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
She's genuine.

428
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
It's good to see you.

429
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,600
I miss you too, you know.

430
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,280
Oh, I miss you guys.

431
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,040
You do not belong
in California, Ben.

432
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
You should move back here.

433
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,360
I mean it! Come back. Bring Kat.

434
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Well?

435
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
What?

436
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Kat?

437
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,400
I don't know, I...

438
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
I think so.

439
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,320
We get along really well...

440
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,440
It could be, it could well be...

441
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,040
Good.

442
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,360
You deserve to be happy.

443
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Thanks.

444
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Mm.

445
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,160
Oh my god,
why are we here again?

446
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Hey, man. Nostalgia, you know?

447
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,920
Sentiment,
you're like an old man.

448
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,760
Kat and I got married
our final year of law school.

449
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,000
And after graduation
we moved back to New York.

450
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,400
She started working for
the mayor, and I got a job

451
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,600
at a big corporate law firm.

452
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,200
It was a very
late-80's yuppie existence.

453
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
-How's your work going?
-It's going good.

454
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah?

455
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,280
Yeah, finishing up that
thing for the Sunday magazine-

456
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
-What, still?
-Yeah, Ben.

457
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,520
I take my work really seriously,

458
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,360
parasites...

459
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,840
-You're lazy, man.
-I know and love.

460
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
I write like two briefs
a day, what's the big deal?

461
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,280
You write briefs, I wear briefs.

462
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,200
You ever tried feeding a camel
through the eye of a needle?

463
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Huh?

464
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,480
-I can't say I've done that.
-It takes a while.

465
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,880
It's all here baby, trust me.

466
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,680
See, you can go home again.

467
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Oh.

468
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,920
Nothing's changed.

469
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,800
She's upped the material.

470
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,040
Only grist for the mill.

471
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,680
-Hello.
-How are you guys this evening?

472
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,800
-Good, thanks.
-We're doing fine.

473
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,920
Good. What can I get you guys?

474
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,200
We'd like a pitcher of
your cheap, watered-down

475
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,400
draught beer, please.

476
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
-You got it.
-Excuse me.

477
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,840
You're not on
the swim team, are you?

478
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,920
It's OK, he has a brain tumor.

479
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
You don't know?

480
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
How's Kat doing?

481
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Good.

482
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,640
She's working
all the fucking time.

483
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,720
We hardly see each other.

484
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,800
She's a powerful woman, though.

485
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
I get that.

486
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,720
Laminated
"Office of the Mayor" card.

487
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,040
We can park anywhere we want to

488
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
and do.

489
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,840
Why isn't this great?

490
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,440
Come on, doesn't this place
have good feelings for you?

491
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,520
Like, you met Nina here.

492
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,880
That's a good thing.

493
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
That's a fucking good thing.

494
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Here you go.

495
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
All right.

496
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Anything else?

497
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Think that'll do.

498
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
Good.

499
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
It's cute.

500
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
-Cheers, man.
-Cheers, buddy.

501
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,360
I was thinking about
Emily the other day.

502
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
Uh-oh.

503
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
No, just...

504
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,920
That intensity.

505
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
You know?

506
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,320
I mean that, that insane...

507
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,160
feeling of romantic love...

508
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
I swear, man...

509
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,400
Don't even remember
what that felt like.

510
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,000
You're lucky, you piece of shit.

511
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,040
You know it, don't you?

512
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,600
What do you think?

513
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
So...

514
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
what do you do?

515
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,600
I mean, are you
still madly in love?

516
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Yeah.

517
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
That insane thing goes

518
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,720
but something takes its place.

519
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,080
We find new things
that make you happy.

520
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,160
Anyway, hindsight's
always fucked-up.

521
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,400
Emily was nuts, man.
She drove you insane.

522
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Yeah, but...

523
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,760
Yeah, she was fucking cute.

524
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,600
I can still smell her perfume.

525
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
"Tatiana."

526
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,120
It's not fair to
compare people to ghosts.

527
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,640
They're not gonna measure up.

528
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,040
Thanks.

529
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,880
Yes. OK.

530
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,800
OK. No. Remember
to book those chairs

531
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,240
that thing Tuesday
in Staten Island.

532
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,760
Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,840
Yeah. Thanks, Nelson.

534
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh, and, and, and...

535
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,840
The, uhh, the
mayor's reservation also.

536
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
I know.

537
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,480
I know, I just
wanted to make sure.

538
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
I'm gonna be at the
Stockbridge number or this one.

539
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
OK.

540
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
Have a good Thanksgiving.

541
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
See you Monday.

542
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Bye.

543
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,040
What are you, his babysitter?

544
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
He's a very busy man.

545
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,800
Yeah, His Honor.
He can suck me off.

546
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Would you like that?

547
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
Desperately.

548
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,320
Kat, you know, I mean, I've
been in the car for half an hour

549
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,760
it's almost five o'clock. It's
gonna be a fucking nightmare.

550
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,080
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

551
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,160
I don't know
what else I can say.

552
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,360
I'm sorry.

553
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Sex god.

554
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,240
Yeah, you think
that's gonna work?

555
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Yes.

556
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
Well, you're right, goddammit.

557
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Life Saver?

558
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,280
What kind you got?

559
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Banana.

560
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Oh yes.

561
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Oh.

562
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,840
So, how was your day?

563
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,360
My day was grunt work.

564
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,040
Took a deposition from a guy

565
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,880
I swear looked exactly
like Charles Laughton.

566
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Oh.

567
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,480
"Mr Christian!"

568
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,280
This from Joey Adams.

569
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,960
Hiram says, I had a girlfriend
once, for eleven days.

570
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,600
That's a strange
amount of time, I said.

571
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Hiram shrugs.

572
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,320
"Took her that long to
chew through the ropes."

573
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
I can't believe you
can get the Post up here.

574
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,920
It's like an invasion.

575
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
So.

576
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,320
Who's up for a walk?

577
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,120
Forget about it.

578
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Ben?

579
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,960
Yeah. Sure. Why the hell not?

580
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Ma'am?

581
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,920
You know, I really want
to get this crap done.

582
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,680
I don't want to think
about it. Is that OK?

583
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Sure.

584
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,920
-You sure?
-Yep.

585
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
It's you and me, kid.

586
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Have fun.

587
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
Think they said it
was gonna snow tonight.

588
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,560
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

589
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,920
Wouldn't that just be great?

590
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Cold, wet

591
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,600
wouldn't have to do anything.

592
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,840
-Be all cozy.
-Mmm, it smells like snow.

593
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Mmm.

594
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,000
Feel like the bridge
knows the answer.

595
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,600
It's just that Josie and I
built a whole village under it.

596
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Oh yeah?

597
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,440
The Great Falls.

598
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,880
Want to hear a secret?

599
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Yeah.

600
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,800
A troll lives under this bridge.

601
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,000
-Uhuh?
-Yes.

602
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Seen him, have you?

603
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,400
-Sorry.
-Of course.

604
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,840
OK. Whoo!

605
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Take a stick.

606
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,160
-Why? What...?
-Come on, pick a stick.

607
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,800
These are Poo sticks

608
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,680
for Poo and
Piglet's favorite game.

609
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
All right.

610
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,880
Whichever one comes out the
other side first is the winner.

611
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,120
Wait. How do we
know which one is which?

612
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,160
Whichever comes
out first is mine.

613
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,760
-OK. You ready?
-Yes.

614
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,760
One... two, three. Go!

615
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Come on, Sea Biscuit!

616
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
What?

617
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Sorry.

618
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,280
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's OK.

619
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Really, it's OK.

620
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Uhh...

621
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,840
Yes, well, I think this
is the time where you say

622
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,600
we should be heading
back to the house now.

623
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,440
Right. That's not a bad idea.

624
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Umm.

625
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,600
Nina. I'm sorry. I mean, I...

626
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
-totally...
-No. It's, it's not anything.

627
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,160
-It's OK.
-I don't know...

628
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
It's OK.

629
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Sex maniac.

630
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,120
The wayfarers return.

631
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
What smells so good?

632
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,080
-Kat's making banana bread.
-Ah.

633
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Oh, man!

634
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,040
Hey, good walk?

635
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,560
Yeah. It was great.

636
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
What's the score?

637
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,200
21-17, Rams. Four minutes left.

638
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,800
Can they still
find time to lose it...?

639
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
What do you think?

640
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,560
Cowboys have had
six fucking turnovers.

641
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,440
Since when do you give
a shit about the Cowboys?

642
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,280
I can't tolerate incompetence.

643
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
-Hey.
-Hey.

644
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,520
Hmm.

645
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,840
A girl can dream. Gimme.

646
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,880
Red cheeked baby.

647
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Where'd you guys go?

648
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Oh.

649
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,000
I don't know.
The, umm, that bridge.

650
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
The troll bridge?

651
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,400
-Yeah.
-See that bastard?

652
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
I missed him.

653
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,480
Anyone want a beer?

654
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
M-mm.

655
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,680
-Ad-man?
-Yeah.

656
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,440
I kind of avoided
her for months after that.

657
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,120
I still hung out with
Adam, but I made excuses

658
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,320
not to go to their apartment

659
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
not to see her.

660
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,160
Until one night I was
walking home off Broadway.

661
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
Yo! Spare some change.

662
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,240
-He-hey!
-Hu-huh.

663
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,840
-How're you doing?
-Hey, stranger.

664
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
Oh, nice to see you.

665
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,120
-What are you up to?
-Thanks.

666
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,080
Oh, you know
me. I'm just, uhh...

667
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,560
working for the man here.

668
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,760
Oh yeah, all grown up, huh?

669
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,520
Oh no, please.

670
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,360
Everybody I know,
they're having kids

671
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,120
getting apartments
in Park Avenue...

672
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,480
Feel like I'm
getting left behind.

673
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Oh, what? Come on,
you should feel lucky.

674
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,680
-Yeah.
-Chestnut?

675
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,600
-Christmas.
-Nice, hey?

676
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Mmm.

677
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
Hey, what are you doing now?

678
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,960
-Right now?
-Yeah.

679
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,440
-Freezing my ass off.
-Let's go have a drink.

680
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,120
-I gotta get home.
-Aww.

681
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,400
-I can't.
-Why?

682
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,520
I'm taping Jeopardy.

683
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,760
Get out of here!

684
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,880
I-

685
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,560
-promised Adam.
-You don't have a timer?

686
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,120
Yeah, why,
I thought I'd be home.

687
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,880
Well, fuck Jeopardy.
Why, I'm talking about

688
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,120
real human interaction here.
Isn't that more important?

689
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,720
Anyway, it's the
high school tournament.

690
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,160
-Really?
-It is, whole week.

691
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,320
Baby questions.

692
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,360
Hey, so you guys went skiing.

693
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Uhuh.

694
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,480
I haven't talked
to you since then.

695
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Ben, you do not
need to feel weird about...

696
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,920
Troll bridge incident.

697
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Yeah.

698
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
I mean, I wanted
you to know that I

699
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,240
didn't take it badly.

700
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
It just happened.

701
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
It's no big deal, OK?

702
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
You didn't tell him.

703
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
No.

704
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,000
I'm here with uhh...

705
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm here with the
great Kathy Burkland.

706
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Umm...

707
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
No, probably

708
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,840
about an hour. Is that OK?

709
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
OK, great.

710
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,760
All right, you want me
to bring you home anything?

711
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
OK.

712
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,080
Yeah, I love you, too.

713
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Bye.

714
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,640
I just told Adam
that I was, uhh...

715
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,600
I told Adam
I was with Kathy Burkland.

716
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,760
Who's Kathy Burkland?

717
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,240
A girl I went to school with.

718
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,240
God, I don't
know why I did that.

719
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,080
I mean, why would I do that?

720
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,120
Because you're
having a good time.

721
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
So?

722
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Yeah. Guess so.

723
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,000
We're having
a good time, and, and

724
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,920
you don't want
to change anything.

725
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,360
You are having
a good time, aren't you?

726
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Uhuh.

727
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
It's like this

728
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,440
weird cross between
nostalgia and anxiety.

729
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,720
I know,
it doesn't make any sense.

730
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,960
Oh no. No, I'm with you.

731
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,320
It's just that it's impossible
to explain, it's uhh...

732
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,880
You know when you're a kid

733
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,240
and you go to the supermarket

734
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,400
and for the first
time you lose your mom

735
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
and you get that

736
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,040
you know, you get
that kind of rush that...

737
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Yeah.

738
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,560
Yeah, I used to get something
like that when I was little.

740
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,440
I, I would... I'd stare.

741
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Right?

742
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Into a little mirror

743
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,760
until I was utterly terrified.

744
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,920
And, I think, it was this

745
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,600
realization that I was

746
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,880
this solitary thing

747
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,040
physically alone

748
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,000
-right?
-Yeah.

749
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,080
That, that I was,
that I was ultimately alone

750
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
in the universe.

751
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Well, what did you do?

752
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,000
I stopped looking in the mirror.

753
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,040
-No, but...
-No.

754
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm serious.

755
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Oh.

756
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
It's like a...

757
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,400
like forcing yourself
to wake up from a nightmare.

758
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,040
It's the same principle.

759
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,960
I wish I could
describe it better.

760
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,160
I just get these feelings

761
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,920
feelings of longing, you know?

762
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,160
Longing and a kind of fear.

763
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,400
Fear that I've lost something.

764
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
All right.

765
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
You tell me one.

766
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
One what?

767
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,120
A memory, an image, a...

768
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
a PCU.

769
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
OK.

770
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I got one.

771
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
All right.

772
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
It's summer.

773
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,520
It's Boat Club
Beach, it's nighttime.

774
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,040
There's a big bonfire

775
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,280
bright sparks flying around

776
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,040
and Adam and I

777
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,800
we're entertaining the

778
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,400
martini drinkers.

779
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,360
He's doing his,
his Tom Jones impression.

780
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,520
You know,
"What's New, Pussycat?"

781
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
And

782
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,560
I was wearing my dad's

783
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,480
thick, black wool sweater

784
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,480
which smelled like

785
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
like

786
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,480
English Leather, tobacco

787
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,840
and my mother's laughing.

788
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,240
Everything's perfect.

789
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,080
Yeah.

790
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
God

791
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,520
I wish I could have
seen Adam at that age.

792
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,840
You guys must have been so cute.

793
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
If I could freeze
that moment for eternity

794
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
I'd just take it.

795
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Here you go.

796
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Thank you.

797
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
Good night.

798
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Good night.

799
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,000
You're leaving me all alone.

800
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,600
Why don't you come with us?

801
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
To the Mondrian
exhibit? Yeah, right.

802
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
It could be fun.

803
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,520
You could eat a blimpy.

804
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,840
I couldn't, sweetie. I'm fine.

805
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,920
I'm in a groove here.

806
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
-Hey.
-Hey.

807
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Adam's in the other room.

808
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
There he is.

809
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,800
So we can't convince you?

810
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,200
So what's up with you?

811
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Nothing.

812
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,920
Kat's down in DC again
on another fucking congress.

813
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,400
The bachelor.

814
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Yeah.

815
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,480
Living the wild life.

816
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Hi.

817
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,320
I'll see you later, sweetie?

818
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,920
-Leave me a couple cigs here.
-I left three on the table.

819
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,960
Hey, did you see what's
at the  next week?

820
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,960
Yeah, yeah.

821
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,440
My yearly viewing,
"Touch of Evil."

822
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
You up for it?

823
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,320
Yeah. You kidding?

824
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
We're there.

825
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
OK.

826
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Bye.

827
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Have fun!

828
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,760
You know

829
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,000
that mumbling shit is annoying.

830
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,240
I mean

831
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,840
I've seen this movie fifty times

832
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,320
I still don't know
what he's saying.

833
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,080
Honey, we're gonna get wet.

834
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,640
How about a drink?

835
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,320
I don't drink.

836
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,560
How about a bunch of drinks?

837
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,520
Benjie. Benjie.

838
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,000
That's not happening.

839
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,400
So when are you back?

840
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
What?

841
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,840
When are you coming back?

842
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,240
Uhh, not till Tuesday.

843
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Hand razor.

844
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,560
Are you ditching me
for the whole weekend?

845
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,160
You can stay with Adam.

846
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,560
Nice.

847
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
He's going to Boston
to visit his grandfather.

848
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,040
What?

849
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,320
What did you say?

850
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Nothing.

851
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,440
Hello.

852
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,760
Fooled ya. This is Adam and Nina

853
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,160
and we can't come to the phone

854
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,880
but won't you
please leave us a message?

855
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,400
Where the fuck are you?

856
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
It's, umm...

857
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,600
it's gone on eleven.

858
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,120
My grandfather
just called me Flo, so

859
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,640
I have a feeling
the party's about over.

860
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,440
I don't know where you are.
Thought you'd be in bed by now.

861
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,400
Uhh, OK.

862
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,320
I will

863
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
try again half-hour.

864
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Love you. Bye.

865
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
- Hello.
-Hey.

866
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,120
I'm sorry to call you so late.
I didn't wake you up, did I?

867
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,920
No, no. Not at all.

868
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,160
Uhh, I just, I can't find Nina.

869
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,560
You wouldn't happen
to know where she is, would you?

870
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,680
Well, as a matter of fact,
she's sitting right here.

871
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Hold on a sec.

872
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,920
-Hello?
-Hey. What's up?

873
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Hi.

874
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,960
Sounds like you're asleep.

875
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,920
No, we were just hanging out.

876
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
Oh, I guess
I lost track of time.

877
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,600
So you guys
were just hanging out?

878
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah. How's Boston?

879
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,040
Exactly the same as always.

880
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,440
Yeah? How's Peter?

881
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Charming and senile as ever.

882
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,080
Oh, give him,
give him a hug from me.

883
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,760
I will. He sends love.

884
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,800
Yeah.

885
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,320
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

886
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,000
No, I was, I was
leaving now, anyway.

887
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,680
OK. Take a cab, all right?

888
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,680
- Sure.
-You promise?

889
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Of course.

890
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Good.

891
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
All right.

892
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
I love you.

893
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,560
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

894
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,840
Well...

895
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
goddamn.

896
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,760
That wasn't good.

897
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,760
Oh no, it was.
It was totally innocent.

898
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
What are you doing?

899
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
I have to go.

900
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Why?

901
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,160
I thought you said
you won't go fall asleep, Ben.

902
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
Excuse me.

903
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
You know, this is insane.

904
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,560
-What?
-What?

905
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,120
Nina.

906
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
Come on.

907
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,840
Where the fuck's my other shoe?

908
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,000
Whoa, hold on
a second. I'll come with you.

909
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,080
No. Just...

910
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
It's fine. Just, umm...

911
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,320
Stay in bed.

912
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,040
Hello.

913
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,360
Fooled ya. This is Adam and Nina

914
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,720
and we can't come to the phone

915
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,680
but won't you please
leave us a message?

916
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,800
OK, uhh...

917
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,160
all right. Well,
I'm gonna go to bed

918
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
because I gotta get up
early so I can miss traffic.

919
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
Umm...

920
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,600
All right. I love you.

921
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,240
I'll see you tomorrow.

922
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,280
Ben?

923
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,160
OK, Adlai
Stevenson's running mate

924
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,680
to Head of New
York Crime Commission...

925
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,760
-S. D. Schipofer.
-Yes!

926
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Five seconds.

927
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,520
The greatest director
in the history of film was...

928
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,120
-We get...
-Time! Bullshit!

929
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Come on!

930
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,640
Oh, please.
You guys are pathetic.

931
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,280
It's the same
fucking clues every time.

932
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,760
Please get over Orson Welles.

933
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

934
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,560
Last licks.

935
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Down by five.

936
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,520
-No problem.
-Yep.

937
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,920
Would you like
to give or receive?

938
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,400
-It's your turn to give, right?
-Uhh.

939
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,320
Uhh, receive, Alex.

940
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,320
-And...
-Wait, wait, wait.

941
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Go.

942
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,920
OK, he was the
old mayor of New York.

943
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,520
He used to read
comics over the radio...

944
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,960
-Theodore La Guardia.
-I'll give it.

945
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,440
Oh. Umm...

946
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,520
Modern painter,
drinking, dripping...

947
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,720
-Uhh, Jackson Pollock.
-Yeah.

948
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,040
Umm, OK. Novelist, umm...

949
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,240
died in a car accident.

950
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,640
Uhh, Nathaniel West?

951
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,880
Uhh, good, but umm,
existentialist French.

952
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,560
-Camus!
-Camus, good!

953
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,640
OK.

954
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,440
OK, good. One of mine. Umm...

955
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,680
-Can't say that!
-Hey!

956
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,840
-Can't say that!
-Shut up!

957
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,040
Architect, he was the director
of the Bauhaus. He, uhh...

958
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,680
designed the Seagram building
with, umm, Phillip Johnson...

959
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,280
Fall on your
own sword there, kid.

960
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,040
-Thirty seconds.
-Chicago Federal Secretary.

961
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,240
-Glass, Glass-
-

962
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,200
-Yes!
-How the fuck did you get that?

963
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,520
Umm...

964
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,800
Well, I don't know who this is.

965
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,560
-Who the fuck is...?
-Fifteen seconds.

966
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,000
-I know who it is.
-This is, umm...

967
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,240
oh god, OK, umm...

968
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,720
First names

969
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,560
rhymes with the
daughter in Family Affair.

970
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,720
-Buffy?
-Uh-uh.

971
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,840
-Cuppy, Cuppy creme?
-No.

972
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
-Duffy.
-Yes.

973
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
-Duffy.
-Yeah.

974
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,960
OK. Umm, last name...

975
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,800
Game, set and match!

976
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,720
-So close, ladies.
-

977
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,920
Is this a hockey tournament?

978
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,440
Donald Robert Duffy Dyers.

979
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,400
Second-string
catcher for the 1969

980
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,120
World Champion New York Meds.

981
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,880
You said you weren't
gonna do that anymore!

982
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,120
He was a cultural icon,
he caught Nolan Ryan.

983
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,720
Who the fuck is Duffy Dyer?

984
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,680
Who the fuck is
Mies van der Rohe?

985
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,520
Moonlit room.

986
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,080
Curve of a naked woman's back.

987
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,520
Down to where it meets her hip.

988
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,040
Motels.

989
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,960
With ice machines and

990
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,280
lots of towels.

991
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,400
Big towels.

992
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,120
Out of the past...

993
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,560
a new print.

994
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,000
Rainy Saturday.

995
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,240
Driving to buy a pumpkin.

996
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,080
The throb of
the windshield wipers.

997
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,720
College football
game on the radio.

998
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Roxy Music.

999
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,080
So?

1000
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,400
The Sierras in winter.

1001
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,600
Yeah, we're hiking up to
the tower tomorrow, right?

1002
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Yeah.

1003
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,920
Fifth Avenue.

1004
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,680
Night of the first snowfall.

1005
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Hush.

1006
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,680
Snow on her hair.

1007
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,320
Fifteen across.

1008
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,920
Five down.

1009
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,520
Dive into a pool.

1010
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Swimming down.

1011
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,560
Then looking up.

1012
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,840
It's like a cocoon.

1013
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,320
Yeah, that's beautiful.

1014
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
It's sort of like

1015
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,840
being on a boat
when it's raining.

1016
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,920
You know? Something
weirdly great about that.

1017
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,920
It's cozy.

1018
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,200
It's like a good road-house.

1019
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,840
What do you know about
being at a road-house, Ben?

1020
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,720
Are you trying to sound
like a beer commercial?

1021
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,680
Or does it just come naturally?

1022
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,040
What would you like
to talk about, Nina?

1023
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
Well, we could talk about
what a shit-head you are.

1024
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,360
Want more Jack?

1025
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,040
Why not?

1026
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,440
You remember when we used
to come up here with my dad?

1027
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,320
Used to be that guy
down at the bottom.

1028
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,240
Sold those little
cartons of orange drink.

1029
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,440
I used to love
all that fake shit.

1030
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,200
Instant ice tea.

1031
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,480
Slim-Jims.

1032
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,000
Nothing feels that way
any more, that intense.

1033
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
The wind...

1034
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,120
Light...

1035
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,800
It was all kind of dazzling.

1036
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,160
Feel like I can't
smell anything anymore.

1037
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Yeah. Well...

1038
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,920
You find new things
that make you happy.

1039
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,440
It was what you
said to me once, remember?

1040
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,240
You lose certain things,
you gain certain things.

1041
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,040
I've got a thirty-year
old male who fell 40 feet.

1042
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,920
He has severe head injuries and
is unresponsive.

1043
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,160
He has pelvic fractures.

1044
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,920
We're gonna be there
in about three or four minutes.

1045
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
We need a trauma protocol.

1046
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
He just fell?

1047
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,600
How does that happen?

1048
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Adam.

1049
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,600
How do I do this?

1050
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,560
So where's Nina?

1051
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,040
She's trying to
find Adam's mother.

1052
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,960
What?

1053
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,760
What was the look, Kat?

1054
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Ben, there's no look.

1055
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,880
That look... you can't, OK?

1056
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,560
Don't do this to me
tonight. Not tonight.

1057
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,720
Just...

1058
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,120
Please, Ben, I can't take
care of both of you right now.

1059
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,440
Well...

1060
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,800
you don't have
to take care of me.

1061
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,320
Please, just don't
get drunk tonight?

1062
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,280
Did you get through?

1063
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,040
They left already.

1064
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,840
I left a message
for them in the...

1065
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,840
hotel in Vermont. They're not
gonna be there till tomorrow.

1066
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,720
Did you call your mom?

1067
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,760
No.

1068
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,960
Can't handle her right now.

1069
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
I, umm...

1070
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,120
I put out some
crackers and cheese.

1071
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,480
There's tequila.

1072
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,840
Yes, please.

1073
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,640
Are you OK?

1074
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
Want some dinner?

1075
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,880
You don't have to.

1076
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,120
No, I should
probably eat something.

1077
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,880
You know,
I haven't eaten since...

1078
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,600
you know, before.

1079
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,960
I was just gonna make
some spaghetti, is it OK?

1080
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That's great.

1081
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,720
Yeah.

1082
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,240
Remember that
complaint class that we had?

1083
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,320
Wayne Hamilton?

1084
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,200
Uhuh. Professor Mandelton?

1085
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,200
And every Thursday Adam
had the overlapping class

1086
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,920
he'd sneak out 15 minutes early.

1087
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, and...

1088
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,240
Kat, one day, Adam is, umm...

1089
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,480
He's trying very hard

1090
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,240
to sneak out of
class unobtrusively

1091
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,600
but it's Adam, right?

1092
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,840
So, he's bumping along,
and he's wearing this long

1093
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
I remember,
the long Red Army coat.

1094
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,640
And it's
dragging along the floor

1095
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,640
and, he's knocking everybody's
books over as he goes

1096
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,680
and the teacher is in the
middle of this profound thought

1097
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,840
and without
missing a beat, he goes...

1098
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,160
"And so, it became clean on

1099
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,200
you know, this preternatural..."

1100
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,760
"Just as I know that something

1101
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,160
of earth-shattering importance

1102
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,040
happens every
Thursday afternoon at 3:45

1103
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,120
that necessitates
this gentleman's leaving."

1104
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,160
And everybody
just starts laughing!

1105
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,680
And Adam just stops.

1106
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,560
You know, he looks at the floor

1107
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,320
he smiles, and he
looks up, and he goes

1108
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,920
"Well, actually it's
3:40, sir, but, uhh...

1109
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,440
I was really into that story."

1110
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,160
And then he just smiles

1111
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,280
and then he like
shuffles out of the room. Oh.

1112
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,920
-Quintessential.
-It was so beautiful.

1113
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,480
God, we laughed for days.

1114
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,640
The Ad-man.

1115
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,200
Thank you. Let me help.

1116
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,600
No. No, no. Stay.

1117
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,960
I'm going up.

1118
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,320
Why don't you come and
sit with us for a minute?

1119
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,640
I can barely keep my eyes open.

1120
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,360
-You OK?
-Hmm.

1121
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,240
Night. Night, sweetie.

1122
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,120
Good night.

1123
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,600
We love you.

1124
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I know.

1125
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,800
-You coming soon?
-Yeah, yeah.

1126
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
OK.

1127
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,640
Hey.

1128
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,720
Hi.

1129
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,640
-You OK?
-Uhuh.

1130
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,000
-Gonna read?
-Yeah.

1131
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,600
You don't mind if I
stay up for a while, do you?

1132
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,640
No, no.

1133
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
Take care of her.

1134
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
I'll be up soon.

1135
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,440
And, Benjie?

1136
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,360
I need you, too.

1137
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,800
A lot.

1138
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,360
I love you.

1139
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,440
I love you.

1140
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,280
I want to go
back to the hospital.

1141
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,080
I...

1142
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,680
It's the middle of
the night. I don't...

1143
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,280
-Would you drive me?
-I...

1144
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,360
I, I don't... I... I mean... I

1145
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,280
I.. No, I... He's not gonna even
know we're there. We'll...

1146
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,600
I just... I think we
should go in the morning.

1147
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,080
We'll go first
thing in the morning.

1148
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,480
This is insane.

1149
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,800
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to handle this.

1150
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,760
My baby's gonna die.

1151
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,240
My baby's dying.

1152
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Shh, shh, no, no, no.

1153
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,200
I really don't think that I'm
gonna be able to handle this.

1154
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,840
Because I feel like my head's
just gonna explode or something

1155
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,880
and I don't know what to do.

1156
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,600
I love you so much.

1157
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,200
Do you despise me?

1158
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,000
I love you, but...

1159
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,040
But...

1160
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,440
This is over.

1161
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
You know that.

1162
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,160
I'm evil.

1163
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,080
I am so evil.

1164
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,640
His best friend.

1165
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,080
I mean, what were we doing?

1166
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,640
Ben, what the
fuck were we doing?

1167
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,440
Umm...

1168
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,480
I'm sorry, but do you
mind if I go in there alone?

1169
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,200
Hey, uhh, you want us to wait?

1170
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,960
No, umm...

1171
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
I'll take a cab.

1172
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,200
OK.

1173
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Benjie?

1174
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Coming?

1175
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
Yeah, sorry.

1176
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,880
I'll need some bread. Can you
get a loaf of that olive bread?

1177
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,840
Is this how you cope?

1178
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,920
Cooking, shopping.
I mean, what are you?

1179
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,720
Martha Stewart? Can
we just get out of here?

1180
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,640
What? You
think I'm enjoying this?

1181
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,200
Do you think this is what
I want to be doing right now?

1182
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,400
We have no food, Ben. OK?

1183
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,320
Can we just get this over with?

1184
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,000
Sorry that it's such
a chore to be with me.

1185
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,360
Sorry I'm not Nina.

1186
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,120
What do you want to do?

1187
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,840
I'd like to kill you.

1188
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,080
Kat, you want to leave?

1189
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,080
Leave?

1190
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,520
Why the fuck should I leave?

1191
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,480
I'm not the asshole.

1192
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,360
I'm not the one who's
fucking his best friend's wife.

1193
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,840
Do you want me to leave?

1194
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,480
St-

1195
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,760
How, how could you do this?

1196
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,480
I mean, Adam?

1197
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,080
You, you're unreal.
You fucking terrify me.

1198
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,160
Kat, please.

1199
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,640
-What? What, is this a bad time?
-What do you want me to say?

1200
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,880
I don't know why I did it!

1201
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,720
I mean, what are
you? A two-year old?

1202
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,920
You just take whatever you
want? Fuck everyone else!

1203
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,600
It was a horrible
thing to do! I'm sorry!

1204
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,720
I'm sorry if I hurt you!

1205
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,320
What? If you hurt
me? Are you insane?

1206
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,400
What do you want from me?

1207
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,080
Don't fuck other people!

1208
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,680
Don't break my h...

1209
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,040
...my heart. How's that?

1210
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,880
God, you piece of shit!

1211
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,480
You know...

1212
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,240
I can, uhh...

1213
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,560
I can almost...

1214
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,480
I can almost understand
you doing this to me.

1215
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,520
But how...?

1216
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,120
I mean, did...
did you want to possess him?

1217
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Somehow?

1218
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,120
Some, some part of him

1219
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,760
you couldn't have? Huh?

1220
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,840
So you fuck his
wife, is that it?

1221
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,440
You killed him,
I hope you know that!

1222
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,120
I mean,
you know what he was like!

1223
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,200
Shut the fuck up!

1224
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,440
I don't know you.

1225
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,200
You're shit.
You are fucking shit!

1226
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,320
I know what I did!

1227
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,880
I know it!

1228
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,200
Fuck.

1229
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:29,760
Adam.

1230
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,760
I'm sorry.

1231
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
I love you.

1232
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,440
-Too wild!
-Yeah.

1233
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,120
-Hey.
-Hey.

1234
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,640
Oh my god.

1235
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Look at you.

1236
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,520
You look great.

1237
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,240
So do you.

1238
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,960
How are you?

1239
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,840
-I'm OK.
-Yeah? You made partner?

1240
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,760
Oh, no. Actually, I quit.

1241
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,240
You're kidding.

1242
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,280
No, no, no.

1243
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,880
Hmm.

1244
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,440
Well, what about
you? You, umm...

1245
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,800
I heard you were in London.

1246
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,440
Yeah.

1247
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,520
How's that?

1248
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,680
It's great.

1249
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,800
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I love it.

1250
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,360
I heard about you and Kat.

1251
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,920
I'm sorry.

1252
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,760
Yeah. Well...

1253
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,680
Do you keep in touch?

1254
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,800
Yeah. She's doing good.

1255
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,520
She's getting married, in April.

1256
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:08,880
-Really?
-Yeah.

1257
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,080
He's a good guy,
actually. I met him.

1258
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,480
That's great.

1259
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,560
Happy for her.

1260
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,400
Well, how long
are you in New York?

1261
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,760
Umm...

1262
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,520
-Hi.

1263
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,920
Hi.

1264
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,760
-That felt good.

1265
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,040
Oh, I'm sorry.
Honey, this is Ben.

1266
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,240
This is Ben Hoggs.

1267
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,360
Oh my god.
Ben, good to meet you.

1268
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,840
Nina's told me
so much about you.

1269
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,440
This is my husband Chris.

1270
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And this

1271
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,520
this is Owen.

1272
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,680
Hello monster.

1273
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,600
-Hey.
-

1274
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,760
Hi, Owen.

1275
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,160
How you doing?

1276
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,600
Oh my god, he's, uhh...

1277
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,600
-He's beautiful.
-Isn't he gorgeous?

1278
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,680
Yeah.

1279
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,760
Just like his mom.

1280
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,840
Oh, why don't we sit down?

1281
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,200
You'll have supper with us, huh?

1282
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,400
Oh...

1283
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,400
Well, I mean,
I'd love to, but, umm...

1284
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,360
I gotta be somewhere at eight.

1285
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,680
Are you sure? Oh, come on.

1286
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,600
Yeah. Yeah, I'm afraid...

1287
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,760
but, uhh, thanks. It's...

1288
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,760
I mean, actually, I should

1289
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,400
I should probably
get going right now.

1290
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,920
All right. Umm...

1291
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,600
-I'm gonna walk you out.
-OK.

1292
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,160
-Good to meet you.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

1293
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,480
So, when do you
go back to London?

1294
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,760
Oh, umm...

1295
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,160
day after tomorrow.

1296
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,520
I was going to call.

1297
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
Uh.

1298
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,720
Don't worry.

1299
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,680
How are you, Ben?

1300
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,560
Are you OK?

1301
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,120
I try to do good things.

1302
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,240
I know.

1303
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,680
I do, too.

1304
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,080
T... Owen is beautiful.

1305
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,480
Looks just like you.

1306
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,800
Yeah.

1307
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,960
I can't believe
how much I love him.

1308
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,000
I'll call you next time.

1309
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,280
I promise.

1310
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,520
You better.

1311
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,440
For too long

1312
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,920
Inside of me

1313
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:37,000
And the things unsaid

1314
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,560
Lost in the moment

1315
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,840
Wait for a while

1316
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,520
At me with a smile

1317
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,520
I was going through

1318
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,440
A chance being kind

1319
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:40,120
Made me realize

1320
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,160
Lost in the moment
