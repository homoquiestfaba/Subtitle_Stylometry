1
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:42,022
Helmwige! Here! Bring your horse

2
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:41,978
Tether your stallion
next to my mare to graze

3
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,554
- Who is hanging from your saddle?
- Sintolt the Hegeling

4
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:52,127
Ortlinde's mare carries Wittig
the lrming

5
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:55,596
Sintolt and Wittig were always foes

6
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,231
The stallion is kicking at my mare

7
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,907
The hostility alienates the horses

8
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,382
Quiet, Bruno!

9
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:19,188
Siegrune, where have you lingered?

10
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:28,393
There was work to do

11
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,541
Are the others here?

12
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:58,625
Grimgerde and Rossweisse!
They are riding abreast

13
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:19,950
Greetings, you riders!

14
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,671
lnto the wood with your steeds

15
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:22,579
Keep the mares far apart ...

16
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,577
... until the hatred has subsided

17
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:35,185
My grey has already paid
for the heroes' anger

18
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:53,605
Welcome!

19
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,050
Were you together?

20
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,888
We were separate and met only today

21
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,391
lf we are all assembled ...

22
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:13,065
... let us set out for Valhalla
to bring Wotan his warriors

23
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,294
One of us is still missing

24
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,636
Brunnhilde is still
with the Walsung

25
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,006
We must wait for her

26
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:30,314
We will receive a grim welcome
if we arrive without her

27
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:37,221
This way!

28
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:40,394
Brunnhilde is galloping here

29
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:02,482
She is heading towards the firs

30
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:06,520
How Grane is panting!

31
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:10,916
l never saw Valkyries galloping so

32
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:14,622
- What is on her saddle?
- That is no hero

33
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,036
She's carrying a woman

34
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:24,504
How did she find her?

35
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:27,197
She gives no greeting!

36
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,505
Brunnhilde, don't you hear us?

37
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,484
Help our sister from her horse!

38
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,120
Powerful Grane has sunk
to the ground

39
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,961
She lifts the woman from the saddle

40
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,431
Sister, what has happened?

41
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:10,883
Help me in my sorest need!

42
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:14,682
Whence come you?
Only fugitives fly thus

43
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:20,227
l am fleeing and being pursued
by the father of battles

44
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,763
Have you lost your senses?
Speak! Tell us!

45
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:38,444
Sisters, look from the mountain!
Look north whether Wotan is near

46
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:46,351
Can you see him yet?

47
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:50,157
A storm threatens

48
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,953
Heavy clouds are massing

49
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,831
Father is riding his sacred steed

50
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:06,031
The raging hunter is coming!
Shield me, sisters!

51
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,042
- Save this woman!
- But who is she?

52
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:16,706
This is Sieglinde,
Siegmund's sister and bride

53
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:20,552
Wotan is towering with rage
against the Walsungs

54
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:24,949
Brunnhilde was to have withheld
victory from her brother

55
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:30,155
But l sheltered Siegmund
in defiance of the god ...

56
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:33,463
... who smote him with his spear

57
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:38,635
Siegmund fell, but l fled
with his wife

58
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,700
To save her l have hurried to you

59
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,341
Protect me too, in my fear,
from punishment

60
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,116
Deluded sister,
what have you done?

61
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,589
Woe, Brunnhilde!

62
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:07,263
Have you deliberately disobeyed
the father of hosts?

63
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:14,170
- Darkness looms from the north
- A raging storm steers hither

64
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:21,074
Wildly neighs father's horse,
fearfully snorting as it comes!

65
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:30,383
Woe to this poor woman
if Wotan finds her

66
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,265
Lend me your swiftest steed
that would spirit the woman away

67
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:42,532
Are you urging open defiance?

68
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:46,433
Rossweisse, lend me your courser!

69
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:49,933
He has never fled from father

70
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,940
- Helmwige, hear me!
- l obey our father

71
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,750
Give me your horse!

72
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,782
See my distress!

73
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:07,019
Stand by me as l have stood by you

74
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:11,163
Save this wretched woman!

75
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:25,242
Do not concern yourself over me

76
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:36,114
Death is all l ask

77
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:40,883
Who bade you bear me from battle?

78
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:49,699
Had l been struck by the weapon
that slew Siegmund ...

79
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:59,536
... l should have met my end
united with him!

80
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:03,882
Far from Siegmund!

81
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:13,487
Death overwhelms me at the thought

82
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:18,829
lf l am not to curse you
for your care ...

83
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:24,370
... then hear my solemn entreaty

84
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:29,710
Thrust your sword into my heart

85
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:37,078
Live, woman, for love's sake!

86
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:42,248
Save the pledge from him

87
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:45,424
A Walsung is growing in your womb

88
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:55,028
Save me, fearless one!

89
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:58,964
Save my child!

90
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:04,075
Shelter me, you maidens!

91
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:09,383
- The storm is approaching
- Fly, all who fear it!

92
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:13,113
Away with the woman!

93
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,487
No Valkyrie dares protect her

94
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,584
Save me!

95
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:22,362
Save a mother!

96
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:31,763
Then flee at once, and flee alone

97
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:37,871
l will brave Wotan's vengeance

98
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:45,644
l will detain the angry god
while you escape his rage

99
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,722
Which way shall l turn?

100
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:51,885
Which of you, sisters,
ranged east?

101
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,922
To the east stretches a forest ...

102
00:13:56,497 --> 00:14:00,160
... into which Fafner carried
the Nibelung treasure

103
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:04,594
He assumed the form of a dragon

104
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:09,602
ln a cave he keeps watch
over Alberich's ring

105
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:13,012
A forbidding place for a woman

106
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,945
The wood would shelter her
from Wotan's wrath

107
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:21,051
The mighty one shuns the place

108
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:29,327
- Wotan is galloping to the rock!
- Brunnhilde, hark to the thunder!

109
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,191
Hurry eastward!

110
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:42,999
Defiant, endure all dangers,
hunger, thirst, thorns and stones

111
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:49,344
Laugh if weakness wears you down

112
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:55,180
Know one thing, and guard it ever

113
00:14:57,525 --> 00:15:05,455
ln your womb you carry the world's
most wondrous hero

114
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:23,578
For him preserve the fragments
of the sword

115
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,916
He who forges the sword anew
shall one day wield it

116
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:35,725
Let him take his name from me

117
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:42,999
Siegfried, joy in victory!

118
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:54,347
Marvellous miracle!

119
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,751
Most glorious maid!

120
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:06,116
Thank you for your comfort

121
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:12,222
For him whom we loved
l will save the child

122
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:17,631
May reward one day smile at you!

123
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,202
Farewell!

124
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:26,706
Sieglinde's woe blesses you!

125
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:42,557
Stay, Brunnhilde!

126
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:45,430
He has reached the rock!

127
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,793
Woe, Brunnhilde!
Vengeance blazes forth!

128
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:54,167
Sisters, help! My heart fails me!

129
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:59,136
His rage will shatter me

130
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:06,750
- Keep out of sight!
- Stay silent when he calls!

131
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:16,428
Woe! Wotan leaps from his horse

132
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:21,600
Hither he hastens,
breathing revenge!

133
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:38,378
Where is the guilty one?

134
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:42,919
Do you dare hide the miscreant?

135
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:49,194
Your wrath fills us with fear!

136
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:54,294
What have we done to provoke you?

137
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:59,664
Do you mock me? Take care!

138
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:05,109
l know you are hiding Brunnhilde

139
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:12,144
Recoil from her!
She is cast off for ever!

140
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:23,429
From pursuit she fled to us

141
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,763
ln fear she roused your wrath

142
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:41,607
For our anguished sister's sake
we beg you to curb your fury

143
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:49,378
Weak-willed womanish brood!

144
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:54,226
Did you inherit such spineless
spirits from me?

145
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:58,122
Did l make you bold in battle ...

146
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:02,058
... did l make your
hearts harsh ...

147
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:10,709
... so that you wild ones now whine
when my wrath punishes perfidy?

148
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:24,715
Then learn, you whimperers,
her offence

149
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,599
None but she knew my
inmost thoughts

150
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:51,844
None but she knew the source
of my resolve

151
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,730
She was my will's creative womb

152
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,572
Now she has broken the sacred bond

153
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:20,510
She has disloyally flouted
her father's command ...

154
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:29,483
... and turned against me
the weapon my will alone made her!

155
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:39,162
Do you hear, Brunnhilde ...

156
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:44,563
... you to whom l granted
helmet and spear ...

157
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:50,141
... affection, name and life?

158
00:20:55,249 --> 00:21:02,621
Do you hear me make this charge,
and yet hide from your accuser ...

159
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:08,518
... whose punishment you evade?

160
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:44,856
Here l am, father

161
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:50,161
Pronounce my sentence!

162
00:21:56,577 --> 00:22:02,641
The sentence does not stem from me.
You brought punishment on yourself

163
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,181
My will brought you into being ...

164
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,948
...but you have set your
will against it

165
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:18,923
You could carry out my orders only,
but you have given counter-orders

166
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:23,760
You were my wish's maid ...

167
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,002
... but your wishes thwarted mine

168
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:30,606
You were my shield-bearer ...

169
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,504
... but you raised it against me

170
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:38,944
You were my arbiter of fate ...

171
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,954
... but you chose to frustrate me

172
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,950
You were my rouser of heroes ...

173
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,720
... but you roused them against me

174
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:06,110
Wotan has told you what you were

175
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:12,847
Tell yourself what you are now

176
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:18,180
No longer are you my wish's agent

177
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,455
You have been a Valkyrie

178
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:30,967
Henceforth be what you are now!

179
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:40,643
Would you disown me?

180
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:48,885
Never again will l send you
from Valhalla ...

181
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:54,751
... never assign heroes to you

182
00:23:57,264 --> 00:24:02,031
Never again will you bring
victors into my hall

183
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:06,865
At the god's banquets ...

184
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:15,274
... never again will you pass
me my drinking-horn

185
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:21,848
Never again will l kiss my child

186
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:28,385
From the gods you are cut off ...

187
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:35,060
... expelled from the race
of the immortals

188
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:40,197
Our bond is broken

189
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:49,772
You are banished from my sight

190
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,317
Woe, sister!

191
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,825
Do you take all you once gave?

192
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:08,425
He who masters you will
take it from you

193
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:14,840
To this mountain l banish you

194
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:22,104
l will lock you tight in
defenceless sleep

195
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:30,345
Let the man then capture the maid
who finds her and wakes her

196
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,353
Retract your curse!

197
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:38,060
Must the maid be wasted by a man?

198
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:44,960
Hear our plea!

199
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,608
Spare this dreadful disgrace!

200
00:25:55,649 --> 00:26:01,110
We should share in her shame

201
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:10,660
Did you not hear what l decreed?

202
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,359
She is banished from your band

203
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,603
No longer shall she ride with you

204
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:31,746
Her beauty's flower will wither

205
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,754
A husband will win her favours

206
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:46,991
Henceforth she shall belong
to this masterful man ...

207
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:56,068
... sit and spin by the fire,
the butt and sport of all mockers

208
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:10,756
Does her fate appal you?

209
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,359
Then flee the lost one!

210
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,630
Keep away!

211
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,496
Should any of you dare to linger
and sustain her ...

212
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:30,675
... that fool shall share her fate

213
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:34,838
Of this l warn you!

214
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:46,081
Away with you! Shun this rock!

215
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:49,622
Quickly, ride away now ...

216
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,630
... or calamity will befall you

217
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:57,346
Was my offence so shameful ...

218
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:06,426
... that you punish my misdeed
with such shame?

219
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:28,277
Was what l did to you so base ...

220
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:42,559
... that you so profoundly
debase me?

221
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:53,195
Was what l did so dishonourable ...

222
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:07,552
... that my dereliction now
robs me of honour?

223
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,206
Speak, father!

224
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:35,204
Look me in the eyes

225
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,384
Silence your wrath

226
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:58,193
Make clear the hidden guilt
which forces you ...

227
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:06,073
... inflexibly and obstinately ...

228
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:13,945
... to repudiate your
favourite child

229
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,058
Ask what you did

230
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,829
lt will explain your guilt to you!

231
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:35,499
l carried out your command

232
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,876
Did l command you to fight
for the Walsung?

233
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:47,119
As ruler of battles, you did

234
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:50,752
But that order l revoked

235
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:59,923
When Fricka had turned your
intention against you ...

236
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:04,967
... when you resigned yourself
to her will ...

237
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:09,370
... you were your own enemy

238
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:19,446
l fancied that you understood me,
and castigated conscious defiance

239
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:28,287
But you thought me cowardly
and foolish

240
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:37,533
So did l not need to
avenge treason?

241
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,421
l am not wise

242
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:08,834
But one thing l know ...

243
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:16,602
... that you loved the Walsung

244
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:27,712
l knew the inner conflict that
compelled you to erase this

245
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,689
You had to see the alternative ...

246
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:40,429
... though it grieved you ...

247
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:47,234
... that you should deny Siegmund
your defence

248
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:50,703
You knew this, yet defended him?

249
00:35:55,882 --> 00:35:58,874
Because for you l kept in sight ...

250
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:07,090
... the one thing on which
you turned your back in perplexity

251
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:14,992
She who in war guarded Wotan's back
saw what you could not see

252
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:26,339
l had to see Siegmund!

253
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:33,250
l appeared to warn him of death

254
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:42,161
l looked into his eyes,
l heard his words

255
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:46,563
l understood the hero's distress

256
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:56,800
The brave man's laments
rang in my ears ...

257
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:04,343
... the fearful despair of love ...

258
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:11,756
... the dauntless defiance
of the saddest of souls

259
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,863
ln my ears was echoed ...

260
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:28,301
... what, deep in my breast,
filled my heart

261
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:43,749
Shy, astonished, l stood in shame

262
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:51,153
l could think only of helping ...

263
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:58,664
... of sharing victory or death
with Siegmund

264
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:05,910
l knew that this alone was
the lot to choose

265
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:32,027
He who breathed this love
into my heart ...

266
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:48,643
... whose will had bound me
to the Walsung ...

267
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:56,158
... to him l was inwardly loyal ...

268
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:10,007
... though l
disobeyed your command

269
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:18,877
So you did what l longed to do ...

270
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:25,989
... yet which necessity
forced me not to?

271
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:34,763
So you thought of bliss ...

272
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,604
... when woe broke my heart ...

273
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,400
... when need roused my wrath ...

274
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:50,949
... and for love of the world
l dammed up the love in my heart?

275
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:57,584
While l turned against myself ...

276
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:02,024
... goaded by frustration ...

277
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:09,425
... driven by longing
to the dread decision ...

278
00:40:10,636 --> 00:40:17,098
... to end my sorrow in the ruins
of my own world ...

279
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:52,467
... then bliss was enfolding you

280
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:11,020
lntoxicated with emotion ...

281
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:20,028
... you laughingly drank
the draught of love ...

282
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:31,181
... while, for me, gall was blended
with divine distress

283
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:50,998
Then follow your foolish instinct

284
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:56,905
You have broken with me

285
00:42:04,884 --> 00:42:06,909
l must shun you

286
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:13,552
Never again can l share secret
counsels with you

287
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:18,827
We can no more work together

288
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:29,230
While life and breath endure,
the god must never see you again

289
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:57,025
Unfit for you was the maid ...

290
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:03,599
... who did not understand you

291
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:11,076
My own view counselled
one thing only ...

292
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:19,188
... to love what you had loved

293
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:33,366
lf l must leave you ...

294
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,702
... if you must sever what
once linked us ...

295
00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:45,543
... and cut from yourself
a half ...

296
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:51,178
... that belonged wholly to you ...

297
00:43:55,995 --> 00:43:59,123
... do not forget that!

298
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:04,366
You cannot dishonour what will
always be a part of you ...

299
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,433
... cannot wish for a disgrace
that debases you

300
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:15,337
You would be demeaned ...

301
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:20,252
... if you saw me derided

302
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:36,530
You followed the power of love

303
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:47,336
Now follow him whom you must love!

304
00:44:53,619 --> 00:45:00,388
lf l must depart from Valhalla,
no longer to work with you ...

305
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:07,222
... and belong henceforth
to a man as master ...

306
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,894
... do not give me to some boaster

307
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:18,905
Let whoever wins me not
be worthless

308
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,480
You flouted the father of battles

309
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:29,445
Now he cannot choose for you

310
00:45:34,326 --> 00:45:37,318
You begot a noble race

311
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:45,025
No coward can disgrace it

312
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,208
The most dedicated of heroes will
spring from Walsung stock

313
00:45:55,347 --> 00:45:59,374
Do not speak of the Walsung race!
l have flung it off with you

314
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,581
My grudge had to destroy it

315
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:10,723
She who tore herself
from you saved it

316
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:16,661
Sieglinde carries the holiest fruit

317
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,964
ln grief and pain ...

318
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:24,837
... she will bear what she
anxiously hides

319
00:46:27,346 --> 00:46:33,979
Never seek protection for her
from me, nor for her womb's fruit!

320
00:46:36,222 --> 00:46:38,747
She guards the sword you made
for Siegmund

321
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:42,490
And that l broke in pieces!

322
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:12,748
Child, do not seek to upset
my decision

323
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:16,559
Await your fate ...

324
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:21,197
... whatever befall

325
00:47:24,203 --> 00:47:29,470
l cannot choose for you!

326
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:41,377
But now l must go

327
00:47:42,188 --> 00:47:45,351
l have already stayed too long

328
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:49,184
l must turn from you

329
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:52,828
What you wish l may not know

330
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,902
l must only see
your punishment enforced

331
00:48:00,873 --> 00:48:03,808
What must l suffer?

332
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,187
l shall enclose you in deep sleep

333
00:48:31,003 --> 00:48:36,373
Whoever finds
the weaponless maid ...

334
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:43,212
... shall awaken her and
win her as wife

335
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:54,987
lf fetters of sleep are to bind me
as easy booty to any faintheart ...

336
00:48:56,962 --> 00:49:01,922
... one thing you must grant ...

337
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:08,966
... for which l plead in anguish

338
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:12,673
Surround my sleep ...

339
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:20,881
... by fearsome terrors, so that
only the most fearless hero ...

340
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:25,822
... will find me on the rock!

341
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:34,999
You ask too much,
too great a favour

342
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:47,212
This one thing you must grant

343
00:49:48,147 --> 00:49:51,241
Annihilate your child

344
00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:57,646
Trample your favourite under foot.
Crush the maid with your spear

345
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:07,788
But do not condemn her ...

346
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:13,298
... to this gross degradation

347
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:19,709
At your command ...

348
00:50:21,246 --> 00:50:24,704
... let flames flare up

349
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:32,514
Let their fiery glow
engirdle the rock

350
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:38,658
Let their tongues lick,
their teeth devour ...

351
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:50,967
... any coward who ventures
to approach the dread rock

352
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:24,106
Farewell, valiant child ...

353
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:31,541
... holiest pride of my heart!

354
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:51,262
lf l must shun you ...

355
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:58,340
... and may not again lovingly
give you a greeting ...

356
00:52:01,313 --> 00:52:06,945
... if you may no more
ride beside me ...

357
00:52:09,721 --> 00:52:13,487
... or bring me mead at my meal ...

358
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:22,189
... if l must lose you,
whom l loved ...

359
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:29,835
... you, the delight of my eyes ...

360
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:35,344
... then a bridal fire shall
now burn for you ...

361
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:39,179
... as never has burned for a bride

362
00:52:42,354 --> 00:52:47,519
Let the glow of fierce flames
encircle the rock

363
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:52,427
Let it strike fear into
the fainthearts

364
00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:57,064
Cowards shall flee from
Brunnhilde's rock

365
00:53:06,345 --> 00:53:17,085
Only one shall win the bride ...

366
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:29,927
... one freer than l, the god!

367
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:28,645
Those radiant eyes ...

368
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:38,757
... that, smiling, l often
kissed ...

369
00:55:43,268 --> 00:55:47,432
... when the joy of battle
won you an embrace ...

370
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:53,236
... when the praise of heroes ...

371
00:55:54,546 --> 00:55:59,449
... flowed from your sweet lips ...

372
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:06,751
... those sparkling eyes ...

373
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:16,361
... that shone on me in storms ...

374
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:25,669
... when hopeless yearning
seared my heart ...

375
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:34,383
... when, amid wild alarm, l longed
for worldly pleasures ...

376
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:49,561
... for the last time let them
delight me ...

377
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:57,673
... with their last farewell kiss

378
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:09,747
On a more fortunate man ...

379
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:13,947
... let their star shine

380
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:23,028
For the hapless immortal ...

381
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:37,881
... they must close for ever

382
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:56,260
For so does the god now
turn from you

383
00:58:04,075 --> 00:58:14,542
So does he kiss the godhead
from you!

384
01:00:57,582 --> 01:00:59,573
Loge, hear me!

385
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,079
Come hither!

386
01:01:05,557 --> 01:01:08,993
As first l found you,
a fiery glow ...

387
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:14,030
... as you escaped me,
a wandering flame ...

388
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:17,224
... as l bound you ...

389
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:21,771
... so today l summon you!

390
01:01:22,841 --> 01:01:25,935
Arise, flickering flame!

391
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:33,082
Ring the rock with fire!

392
01:01:40,025 --> 01:01:41,993
Loge! Appear!

393
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:57,628
He who fears my spear-point ...

394
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:14,550
... shall never penetrate
the fire!

395
01:05:28,653 --> 01:05:34,614
