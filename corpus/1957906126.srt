155
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:37,294
        Great. Thank you!
       I'll see you soon.

156
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,006
            Last one!
        Oh, I need this.

157
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,566
            So do I.

158
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,250
           [stammers]
  I-it's for my granddaughter.

159
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,735
       It's her favorite.

160
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:46,586
     Oh, it's for my friend.
             It's...

161
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,995
          Her favorite.

162
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,072
     But my granddaughter's
      only nine years old.

163
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:49,848
     How old is your friend?

164
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,000
         Nine...Ty-two.

165
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,261
        Can she even chew
        saltwater taffy?

166
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,522
     She sucks on it, okay?

167
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,916
        It's the last joy
          in her sad...

168
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,194
         Toothless life.
          [sighs sadly]

169
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:05,346
    You know, I taught drama
  in high school for 30 years,

170
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,108
   And that is one of the best
  sad sighs I have ever heard.

171
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,851
  It just about broke my heart.

172
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,611
      -So I get the taffy?
            -Heck no!

173
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:13,597
       Your friend may be
        on her deathbed,

174
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,189
     But my granddaughter's
          gonna kill me

175
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,283
        If I don't arrive
         with this box.

176
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,860
 Sugar isn't good for children.
   That's why I never had any.

177
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,380
    Ahh, so this is for you?

178
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:22,939
            [scoffs]

179
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,625
   No, I just maybe was gonna
      have a couple pieces

180
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,052
 Before I gave it to her, but--

181
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,462
      What kind of a person
   steals candy from a child?

182
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,556
     I was gonna pay for it!

183
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,728
       Well, why don't you
 and your friend suck on those?

184
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,315
         Hank marshall.

185
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,567
         Molly foreman.

186
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,404
     So you coming or going?

187
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:48,055
   Coming, to spend christmas
        with my daughter.

188
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,966
            And you?

189
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,368
           Returning.
    I was visiting my sister.

190
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,155
       No. This is on me.

191
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:56,581
       [thumps bills down]

192
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,658
     Why would you buy candy
     for a perfect stranger?

193
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,585
           Strangers?

194
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,904
           After what
      we just experienced?

195
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:04,814
   Yeah, but, you know, still.

196
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,050
     'tis the season. Right?

197
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,596
              [♪♪]

198
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,441
        How many taffies
        did you give her?

199
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,167
           Just one...

200
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,018
           At a time.

201
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,260
              Mom.

202
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:28,429
         It's christmas!

203
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,841
  Well, you know, maybe I just
     gave her four or five.

204
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:34,010
        No, no, make that
        four and a half,

205
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,847
 Because she didn't really like
    the ginger-cinnamon one.

206
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,866
         [both laughing]

207
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,351
      Well, since we're on
      the subject of taffy.

208
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,535
       Do you want to hear
       my new great idea?

209
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,703
              Sure.

210
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:44,963
               Mm.

211
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,631
             [thud]

212
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,026
             [sighs]

213
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,544
    You are gonna make taffy?

214
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,047
  Yeah, and I can come up with
    all kinds of cool flavors

215
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,365
     And then we can give it
        to the neighbors.

216
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,700
     What did the neighbors
         ever do to you?

217
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,310
        Mom. I'm serious.

218
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,385
   [chuckles] I know you are.

219
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,371
      I think, eventually,

220
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,040
     I can probably sell it
     at the christmas fair,

221
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:04,891
     And then it'll make me
           so popular

222
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,209
    That I will open a shop,

223
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,468
     And then we'll be rich.

224
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,470
 This isn't gonna be like the...

225
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,064
 Candle-making incident, is it?

226
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,306
          "experiment."

227
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,399
  The candle-making experiment.

228
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,826
         And it's okay,

229
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:16,886
         Because we have
       fire insurance now.

230
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,404
  I know what you're thinking--

231
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,572
       "kristen going off
  on another one of her whims,

232
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,166
  Gonna fall flat on her face."

233
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,076
       No, of course not.

234
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,754
 We can't all be the perfect mom
            like you.

235
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,915
   I am not perfect, kristen.

236
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,401
    It's not an insult, mom.

237
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,803
             You are
  pretty darn close to perfect.

238
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,406
        When I was a kid,

239
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,833
       You made every meal
          from scratch.

240
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,686
            You sewed
    my Halloween costumes...

241
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,357
       ...And you coached
         my soccer team,

242
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,443
      And you made amazing
       christmas s'mores.

243
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:51,696
 Well, I can teach you how to do
     all of this for tofino.

244
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,607
            -Perfect.
         -[door closes]

245
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,925
             Gammy!

246
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,351
             Stevie!

247
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,037
             Pizza!

248
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:04,543
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

249
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:05,544
         Congratulations
        on your new job.

250
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,620
           Thank you.

251
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,697
  We are so stoked to have you
  here for christmas this year.

252
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,775
 Well, and this is gonna be, oh,

253
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:14,127
  The first time in a long time
that I haven't hosted christmas,

254
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,370
        But great news--

255
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,515
      We can do everything
  that I do at home right here.

256
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:20,800
             -Yeah.
             -Sure.

257
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,118
           And because
   you're going to be so busy,

258
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,395
         I can help out.

259
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:25,638
     Just tell me if there's
     anything that I can do.

260
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,381
      Well, the back patio
      needs to be painted,

261
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,383
      The door to the attic
       squeaks like crazy,

262
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,311
   And how are you with taxes?

263
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,072
      Are you all good with
   small-business regulations?

264
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,556
           [laughing]

265
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,742
 You're not here to work, molly.

266
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:40,470
      You're here to relax
     and enjoy the holidays.

267
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,913
 -[kristen] you got everything?
         -[tofino] yup.

268
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,401
        I've got to drop
        tofino at school

269
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,236
   And, uh, run a few errands.

270
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:50,571
   Oh, do you want me to come?

271
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,649
        No. I'll be back
         in a few hours,

272
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,842
          And remember
       what steve said--?

273
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,410
            "relax."

274
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,513
              Yeah.
      [chuckles nervously]

275
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,058
         [sighs deeply]

276
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:05,345
      [tofino] bye, gammy!

277
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,772
              [♪♪]

278
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,462
              Om...

279
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,299
              [♪♪]

280
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,026
              Mom--

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,471
       "add essential oils
          to your tea."

282
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,549
     I'd rather add bailey's
          to my coffee.

283
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:46,269
             [sighs]

284
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,963
       What's the matter?

285
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,106
There are places for everything.

286
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,820
 There's way too many toys here.

287
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,782
       Hi! Sorry I'm late!

288
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,475
    Mom, what are you doing?

289
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:02,661
      It's so much better,
            isn't it?

290
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,162
           Do you see
    the complementary colors?

291
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,239
      Mom, please come down
           from there.

292
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,000
         [chuckles] oh!
  And I sorted out your pantry.

293
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:10,835
  I cleaned your laundry room.
          I really did.

294
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,061
         Mom, you don't
      have to do all that.

295
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,229
    I can clean my own house.

296
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:14,822
       -[grunts dubiously]
        -I have a system!

297
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,399
   It may be a little unique--

298
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,993
    Chaotic, totally insane--
      but it works for me.

299
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,661
       I'm sorry, darling,

300
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,739
   But I'm-- I'm just so used
  to taking care of you and...

301
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,331
        I know, but I can
      take care of myself.

302
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,576
            -And you.
              -Oh--

303
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:27,260
      Why don't you let me
        take care of you?

304
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,578
             Mm-mm.

305
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,929
       Well, let somebody
        take care of you.

306
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,432
     I will, when brad pitt
   finally comes to his senses

307
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,693
     And realizes that women
       are like fine wine

308
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,195
      And our that flavors
        mature with age.

309
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,606
              Okay.

310
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,682
              Um...

311
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,092
 Well, I have to head back out.

312
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,444
     Tofino has an art class
         at the center.

313
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,537
     Why don't you join me?

314
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,113
        Oh, no, I'm going
    to stay here because I--

315
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:48,598
      -No. No, you're not.
      -I haven't finished.

316
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:51,126
    -There's one more thing.
     -Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm. No.

317

              [♪♪]

318
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:57,123
       Are you gonna come?

319
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,291
              Uh...

320
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,109
    I think I'll look around.

321
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,137
         Nice to be back
    in a theater again, huh?

322
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,464
           [chuckles]
        give gammy a hug.

323
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,115
            Yeah, mm.

324
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:07,283
         Bye, my angel.
     I'll see you in a bit.

325
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:08,634
              Bye.

326
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,228
     I'll just be a minute.

327
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,063
 Don't go re-carpeting the lobby
         while I'm gone.

328
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,565
             [sighs]

329
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,575
        Well, if it isn't
    the airport taffy bandit.

330
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,152
  Oh, I'm glad I ran into you.

331
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,579
      That makes two of us.

332
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:28,654
               Ah.

333

              Here.

336
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,252
          What's this?

337
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,496
             Change.

338
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,572
      From the candy store.

339
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,260
   I'd hate you to think that
 I was stealing your money, too.

340
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,429
          Molly, right?

341
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:46,172
          Good memory.

342
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,267
What man in his right mind would
    forget someone like you?

           Thank you.

      That's the part where
     you're supposed to say

353
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:15,201
     I'm unforgettable, too.

     Well, I'm glad I'm not
    the only one around here

358
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,535
        With good taste.

359
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:33,719
     [laughs] hi. I'm bunny.

360
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,962
             Molly.

361
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:36,539
      Are you new in town?

362
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:37,390
    I'm visiting my daughter.

363
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,465
         Kristen valdi?

364
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,542
         Oh, I love her.

365
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,894
     She has been so helpful

366
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,822
         Organizing all
  the town's christmas events.

367
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:44,564
           Oh. Ladies!

368
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:45,806
              Oh--

369
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,807
     Ladies, this is molly.

370
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,051
   Her daughter runs that blog

371
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,068
         That I'm always
       telling you about--

372
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,477
      Boo-boos and bubbles.

373
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,406
         Ah, I'm ayako,
   and this is my wife, liana.

374
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:54,648
   It's nice to meet you both.

375
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,668
     It's nice to meet you.
      Please, have a seat.

376
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:00,839
 We're known around these parts
   as "the christmas cookies"

377
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,415
          Because we...

378
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,159
      Well, we run most of
      the activities here,

379
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,736
  And guessing by your sweater,

380
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,088
          You are also
      a fan of the season?

381
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,590
         [laughs] I have
     candy canes in my veins

382
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,091
     And tinsel in my toes.

383
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,167
              -Ooh!
           -[laughing]

384
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,411
             [bunny]
    I knew she was one of us!

385
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,354
    How long are you in town?

386
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,263
        The whole month.

387
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,247
        Are you retired?

388
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,932
              Yes.

389
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,843
I taught english and drama until
  about a couple of years ago,

390
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,087
   But right now, I am plan--

391
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,104
        You taught drama?

392
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:26,155
              Yes.

393
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,034
              -Why?
       -One of the events

394
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:32,203
       We're in charge of
   is the town christmas play.

395
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,279
           The show is
   in three and a half weeks,

396
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,597
     And our director quit.

397
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,599
  Yeah, for "personal reasons".

398
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:38,267
     I heard he was getting
    hip-replacement surgery.

399
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,693
             I heard
    he met someone on tinder.

400
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,004
             -Ohh--
      -we need a director.

401
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:43,715
       Well, I can't do it

402
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:44,865
 Because I promised my daughter
   to come here for christmas

403
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,051
   For her and her family, so.

404
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,220
              Hey!
 You met the christmas cookies!

405
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,038
      I knew that you guys
        would hit it off.

406
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,039
       We need your help.

407
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,558
              Okay.

408
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,285
  We need your mother to direct
       the christmas play.

409
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:58,621
           I told them
    that I'm here to help you

410
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,472
     Put christmas together.

411
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:00,806
               No!

412
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,959
    I-I mean, yes, of course,
        I need your help,

413
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,885
         But this is for
        the greater good,

414
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:05,820
      So I can share you...

415
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,055
          ...If I must.

416
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,299
      Well, I-I don't know.
            I just--

417
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,076
            Come on!
    You love directing plays.

418
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,469
          It'll be fun.

419
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,079
       Maybe you can even
    cast yourself in a role.

420
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,581
          [cookies] oh!

421
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:18,899
   No, I'm not gonna do that,
     I mean, directing is--

422
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:20,493
   Is a very big job as it is.

423
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,661
        So you'll do it?

424
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,921
              [♪♪]

425
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:24,647
       Look, if you start
    reorganizing the garage,

426
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,174
     Steve might divorce me.

427
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:30,002
   You reorganized the garage?

428
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,004
     I... I couldn't sleep.

429
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,556
          She'll do it.

430
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:35,934
           I'll do it.

431
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,251
              -Oh!
           -Yes, okay.

432
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:38,919
   Now, get my spreadsheets--

433
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,271
       [cookies chattering
           excitedly]

434
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,015
        Well, what about
     the kids' art auction?

435
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,359
     I mean, the parents...

436
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,762
           But! But...

437
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:50,840
      The christmas play is
the center's biggest fundraiser.

438
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:54,010
  And the town cut our funding,
      so we need a big win,

439
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:56,179
     Otherwise, we're going
    to have to cut programs.

440
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,605
 We've been doing the same show
         for ten years,

441
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,124
 So it's pretty straightforward.

442
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:02,443
 Well, I love a good tradition.
       Do we have a cast?

443
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,795
        Well... Sort of.

444
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,113
   The director played santa,
      so we need a new one.

445
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,949
    Someone with star power.

446
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,710
         Well, we should
      hold some auditions.

447
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:13,713
        We are. Tonight.
             But...

448
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:16,382
 ...We have a prospect in mind,
       if we can get him.

449
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,534
    Like, a local celebrity?

450
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:20,294
     Mm, you could say that.

451
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,962
   [bunny] we want to ask him,
 but we're afraid he'll say no.

452
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:23,539

00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:52,036
        It's the same one
    we've done for ten years.

605
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:54,096
       And we already have
   all the sets and costumes.

606
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,614
      [hank] can't we just
       spice it up a bit?

607
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:57,783
   I mean, add some new songs,

608
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,786
              Or...

609
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:03,381
    Or, maybe, we give santa
      some sort of mission?

610
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:04,940
             Like...

611
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:08,127
        An alien creature
  has landed at the north pole.

612
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,779
      Santa has to go there
       to rescue the elves

613
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:12,615
    Before they get abducted!

614
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:16,543
             Ooh...
  <i> Alien: The christmas story.</i>

615
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,229
       I could get onboard
           with that!

616
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:19,972
           And then...

617
00:23:20,124 --> 00:23:22,382
        An alien-elf<i> baby</i>
 would explode from my stomach--

618
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:24,235
  [liana makes gurgling noise]

619
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:26,145
      We are not gonna have
   an alien kill santa claus.

620
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,797
     Well, of course not...

621
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:33,226
  Because santa would be healed
            by the...

622
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,246
      "magic of christmas,"
            I guess.

623
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,900
     No, we are going to do
   the play exactly as it is.

624
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,085
     It's a town tradition.

625
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:42,478
          I know, but--

626
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:43,904
          We don't mess
     with traditions, hank.

627
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,923
            Why not?

628
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,384
       Because traditions
        keep us grounded.

629
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,912
     They remind us that...

630
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,723
    When circumstances change
             and...

631
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,269
        ...You feel lost

632
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:00,104
          And alone...

633
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:06,110
       ...There are always
 traditions there to hold on to.

634
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,406
        It's like, um...

635
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,118
    ...It's like old memories

636
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,287
      Giving you big hugs.

637
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,623
          [mouths word]

638
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:23,961
   That was a productive day.

639
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,297
    Yeah, even if we did have
 to hear some kinda crazy ideas.

640
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:27,690
               Oh.

641
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,949
   -Tradition is so important.
              -Yes.

642
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,859
            -I agree!
    -Well, see you tomorrow.

643
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:32,136
             -Yeah.
              -Bye!

644
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,305
            [cookie]
     I like the alien thing.

645
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:41,386
           Molly! Hey.

646
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,147
          How did I do?

647
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:44,464
    Well, you weren't kidding
          when you said

648
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:45,874
           You weren't
        much of an actor.

649
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:47,133
           [chuckles]

650
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:48,393
   Wait till you see me dance.

651
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:49,878
       Oh! Luckily for us,

652
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,714
     You don't have to dance
          in this show,

653
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,216
    But if you do want to do
    a little extra rehearsal,

654
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,810
   How about, uh, over coffee?
            Tomorrow?

655
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,497
       I would like that.

656
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:02,166
  You can help me get in touch
      with my inner-child.

657
00:25:02,393 --> 00:25:04,243
     I think you're already
       in touch with that.

658
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,004
 Well, then you can help me get
  in touch with my inner-santa.

659
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:10,341
   Your... Inner-biker-santa?

660
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:13,068
            You ride?

661
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,828
            Oh... No!

662
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,680
    No, I'm more of a, uh...

663
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,682
     Four-wheels-on-the-road
          type of girl.

664
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:22,353
    We wouldn't want to mess
    with tradition, would we?

665
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,149
        See ya tomorrow.

666
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:32,271
        [engine rumbles]

667
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,532
              [♪♪]

668
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,791
      [whispers] the artist
        is very talented.

669
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,626
           [chuckles]

670
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,613
      Plus, quite handsome
  and charming, I've been told.

671
00:25:57,631 --> 00:25:58,630
         You made these?

672
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,948
      Oh, so you admit it--

673
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,466
     You think I'm handsome
          and charming?

674
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:02,375
            No! What?
     I mean, you just said--

675
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,061
          Yes. [laughs]

676
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:05,729
          I made those.

677
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,957
          I, uh, needed
        a creative outlet

678
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,568
 When I retired from journalism,

679
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,977
     And I just kind of like
         fixing things.

680
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,904
              Hmm.

681
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:18,317
 This is, uh, a style I learned
 when I was traveling the world.

682
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:21,303
    It's a japanese technique
        called<i> kintsugi.</i>

683
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:22,562
         It's beautiful.

684
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,248
              Yeah.

685
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:26,333
        Want to sit down?

686
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:33,382
          So, what was
      your favorite place?

687
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:37,669
 Well, if I had to choose, uh...

688
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,579
       I would say egypt.

689
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:41,506
   All that ancient history...

690
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,994
     So many untold stories
   and so much yet to explore.

691
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:47,938
        I always dreamed
    of going to the pyramids.

692
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,589
        Why haven't you?

693
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:52,184
  It was never the right time.

694
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,777
   It's always the right time
  to chase your dreams, molly.

695
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,521
      Hey, hank. The usual?

696
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:57,689
       Yes. Thanks, maeve.

697
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,950
     This is molly foreman.

698
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:02,010
       She is directing me
     in the christmas play.

699
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:04,270
        Oh! Is he a diva?

700
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:05,456
  Now, why would you say that?

701
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:07,607
          His usual is

702
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,276
 A "double-chocolate cappuccino"
    with extra marshmallows.

703
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:12,463
      I like sweet things!

704
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:14,114
     [laughs] you know what?
     That sounds delicious.

705
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,207
       I'll have one, too.

706
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,376
      -[maeve] you got it.
            -Thanks.

707
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:19,194
   You seem pretty happy here.

708
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:21,472
       Being a journalist
        can be exciting,

709
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,049
       But it can also be
          very lonely,

710
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,536
       And when I retired,
 I decided to settle down here,

711
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,538
       So I could finally
      put down some roots.

712
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:30,797
              -Mm.
         -How about you?

713
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,465
       What's your story?

714
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,059
      Oh, I'm the opposite.

715
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,153
      I dug my roots early.

716
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,972
     I came here from the uk
        to go to school.

717
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:43,068
         I, uh, married
     my college sweetheart,

718
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,053
         We had a baby,

719
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:47,981
 And I taught english and drama
     at a local high school

720
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,292
          For 30 years.

721
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,228
    Sounds like a good life.

722
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,088
             It was.

723
00:27:57,251 --> 00:28:00,969
    Until my husband was, um,
   diagnosed with parkinson's.

724
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,256
         But even then,
       it was still good.

725
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,017
       I was lucky enough
 to be able to take care of him.

726
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:11,188
        Until he passed,
      about two years ago.

727
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,173
      I know what it's like
       to lose a partner.

728
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,341
    My wife died very young,

729
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,935
      We were both just 30.

730
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,278
          I'm so sorry.

731
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:23,016
         Taught me a lot
       about life, though,

732
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,536
And that's why I always go after
     the things I've wanted.

733
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:30,457
  I can't remember when I last
  thought about what<i> I</i> wanted.

734
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,786
       I have no idea what
 the next chapter holds for me.

735
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:36,380
               Oh.

736
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:37,789
           Thank you.

737
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,958
          I'm so sorry.

738
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,219
  I shouldn't be dumping on you
           like this.

739
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,704
        What's something
   you've always wanted to do,

740
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,515
 But you've never had a chance?

741
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:49,393
    Well, there is one thing.

742
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:50,802
       -[engine rumbling]
       -I thought you were

743
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,637
     More of a "four-wheels-
   on-the-road" kind of girl?

744
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,064
          I have been!

745
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:56,883
 But I've always been intrigued
         by motorcycles.

746
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:58,551
   And the men who ride them?

747
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,220
             Maybe.

748
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,480
   You sure you wanna do this?

749
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:02,722
               No!

750
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:04,983
   But I'm gonna do it anyway.

751
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,077
           All right.
      Remember what I said.

752
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,564
         Brakes, gas...

753
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:12,657
         Keep it steady.

754
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:15,143
     Start slow, stay calm.

755
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,402
             Got it.

756
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:17,662
         Keep it steady.

757
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:19,498
           Start slow.

758
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,008
             -Whoa!
           -I got it!

759
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,219
           [chugging]

760
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:28,599
      [engine rumbles off]

761
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:30,750
   [officer] letting her ride
       without a license?

762
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,160
     You know better, hank.

763
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:32,936
             -Yeah.
              -Mom?

764
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,106
          Are you okay?
        What's going on?

765
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:38,850
    Just a ticket for driving
  without a motorcycle license.

766
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,760
       Well... A warning.

767
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:42,020
  You're gonna get one, right?

768
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,263
            Promise.

769
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:45,173
            You were
      driving a motorcycle?

770
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:46,191
        Oh, we only went
        around the block.

771
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,433
              "we"?

772
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,602
           She's fine.
        It was my fault.

773
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,104
  Doug? Can I get you a coffee?

774
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,347
          Oh, I'm good.

775
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,199
           Wife has me
      on this "keto" thing.

776
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:55,200
           I'm sorry--
          who are you?

777
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,368
           Who is he?

778
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,352
              Hank.

779
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:58,520
               Hi.

780
00:29:58,539 --> 00:29:59,946
          He's the star
     of the christmas show.

781
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,799
  And this is your bike, hank?

782
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:03,358
           Yes, ma'am.

783
00:30:03,377 --> 00:30:05,377
          [doug] okay,
    time for me to go, folks.

784
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:06,804
        Promised the wife
    I'd take her and the kids

785
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:08,213
       Christmas caroling.

786
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,032
     -Merry christmas, doug.
    -Merry christmas, molly.

787
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,809
     -Remember that license!
            -I will.

788
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,981
              What?

789
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,984
            [tofino]
     I'm ready for cookies.

790
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,228
        Me too! Mom's got
some delicious ones in the oven.

791
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,379
      They should be ready
           any minute.

792
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:25,397
        [inhaling deeply]

793
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,324
              -Yum.
            -Mm! Yum!

794
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,475
         How great is it
       having gammy here?

795
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,386
         It's the best.

796
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:34,239
    Mom, did I tell you that
 gammy let me use her lipstick?

797
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,073
              Shh!

798
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:36,816
              Mom?

799
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,252
           [stammers]
        it was chapstick!

800
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,487
      Could've been worse.
     Could've been mascara.

801
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,415
 So, uh, how is the show going?

802
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,734
         Uh, it's good.

803
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:47,177
    Well, it's a little dull,

804
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:49,571
         But I'm hoping
  that I can liven it up a bit.

805
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,664
           Speaking of
      livening things up...

806
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,016
  I heard you have a boyfriend?

807
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:55,077
           Ooh, gammy!

808
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,746
           No! I mean,
      he's not a boyfriend.

809
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,582
         You should see
    the way he looks at her.

810
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,268
     No. He's just a friend.
         Just a friend.

811
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,586
       Well, if you decide
      it's more than that,

812
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:05,845
        That's okay, too.

813
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:06,605
        [thunder crashes]

814
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:07,698
               Oh!

815
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,850
    Oh, I always get scared.

816
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:11,943
  That is one heck of a storm.

817
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,519
      [kristen] it sure is.

818
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,021
     Too bad it's not snow.

819
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:16,281
 Mm! Is there something burning?

820
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,875
          -My cookies.
          -The cookies!

821
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,528
    Well, you know something
       about grandpa greg?

822
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:24,272
    -He loved burnt cookies.
              -Why?

823
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,532
        Here, watch this.

824
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,959
             Ooh...

825
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,344
      [tofino] they're hot.

826
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:31,704
             Listen.

827
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:32,797
          -[crunching]
         -you hear that?

828
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:33,891
             -Yeah.
              -Mm.

829
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:35,875
             Well...

830
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,619
   Burnt cookies are the best,

831
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:38,303
        Because you don't
        just taste them--

832
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,379
         You hear them.

833
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,623
          And besides--

834
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:44,793
There's nothing wrong with being
a little burnt around the edges,

835
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:46,904
           As long as
      you're sweet inside.

836
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:49,814
           [crunching]

837
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,467
       You know what else
    tastes really good burnt?

838
00:31:52,486 --> 00:31:53,744
             -What?
         -Marshmallows.

839
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:56,062
   Dad burns them all the time
       when we go camping.

840
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,897
              -Hey!
      -And then he tells me

841
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,232
         To make a wish.

842
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,475
    You know, you don't need

843
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:01,977
       Burnt marshmallows
        to make a wish--

844
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,211
  Especially at christmas-time.

845
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,090
            Uh-oh...

846
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:09,075
            Cookies?

847
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,010
            Cookies!

848
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,430
   They're surprisingly good,
            actually.

849
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:15,265
          And crunchy.

850
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:18,751
       [kristen] try this.

851
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,680
      I had a great idea--
 what if I made savory taffies?

852
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,832
That has never been done before.

853
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,276
        Um, there may be
 a really good reason for that.

854
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:28,503
          I'm serious!

855
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:30,763
   It's like when they came up
 with those maple-bacon donuts--

856
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:31,764
        Those were huge.

857
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,434
  So this is maple-bacon taffy?

858
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,845
  No! That's been way overdone.

859
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,530
             This is
    bacon-cheeseburger taffy.

860
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:39,531
             Try it.

861
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,292
              [♪♪]

862
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:56,047
           Is that...
  Is that real hamburger in it?

863
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,142
              Yeah.

864
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:00,793
   Did you get to the squirty
       ketchup-center yet?

865
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,721
      Mm-- mm-mm, oh, no...

866
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,464
        Just now [gags].

867
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,224
        You were warned!

868
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,225
     You did, you warned me.

869
00:33:07,377 --> 00:33:08,727
          [gags] oh...

870
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,987
      It's gross, isn't it?

871
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,975
           Um, it was
 a very creative idea, darling.

872
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,478
   Okay, well, I am just going
     to have to keep trying,

873
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,664
      Because foreman women
         don't give up.

874
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:21,740
            Exactly.

875
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,667
            Exactly!

876
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,336
      Gammy? Are you coming
 to my swim meet this afternoon?

877
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:28,654
       I wouldn't miss it.
           Of course.

878
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,066
I have to go to rehearsal first,

879
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,417
         But I should be
       finished by three.

880
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,345
        No more joyriding
and getting stopped by the cops,

881
00:33:35,572 --> 00:33:36,662
           Young lady.

882
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,016
    No, ma'am. I'll be good.

883
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,427
         -Pinky-promise.
         -Pinky-promise!

884
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:45,080
              Ahh!

885
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,190
      Doug didn't give you
        a ticket, did he?

886
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,859
    I mean, he's my nephew--
       I can talk to him.

887
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:50,585
     -It was just a warning.
           -[laughing]

888
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,270
           You're such
     a bad influence, hank.

889
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:53,346
               Me?

890
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,939
   This one's not so innocent.

891
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,591
               Oh!

892
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,035
        -[water running]
      -[all gasping deeply]

893
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:02,781
         What happened?

894
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,267
       If I had to guess,
 I'd say a backed-up water main.

895
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:07,102
            Our sets!

896
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:08,286
           Our props!

897
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,047
          Our costumes!

898
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:13,108
           All ruined!

899
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:14,968
    We can't afford new ones.

900
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:21,374
        I don't know how
we're gonna put the show on now.

901
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,118
      You know what, folks?

902
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,062
        This might not be
        such a bad thing.

903
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,564
 No, don't look at me like that.
        Just hear me out.

904
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,550
    I know you guys have been
    doing the show for years,

905
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,070
        But the script...
        It was horrible.

906
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:35,572
       This is our chance
         to spice it up.

907
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:36,889
          Start fresh.

908
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:38,650
   But it's a town tradition.

909
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,726
         Every tradition
     has a beginning, molly.

910
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:43,321
         Everything old
          was once new.

911
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,989
      But that doesn't mean

912
00:34:45,142 --> 00:34:46,975
   That you just throw it away
        because it's old.

913
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:48,159
           No, I mean,
     don't misunderstand me.

914
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,069
       I love traditions.

915
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,479
           Traditions
      keep the past alive,

916
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:52,664
    But it's the new things--

917
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:55,500
       It's the new things
       that keep us alive.

918
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,593
             Right?

919
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:00,222
             [sighs]

920
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,185
 Maybe we should give this town
  something new to talk about.

921
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,011
              Hank?

922
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,847
              What?

923
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,107
           You and I,
  we're gonna write a new show.

924
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,834
  Cookies, we're going to have
       new costumes, sets.

925
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,186
   Oh, and maybe bake sales--
           something--

926
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,021
     To raise enough money.

927
00:35:17,174 --> 00:35:19,007
        Yeah, but we only
         have two weeks.

928
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,266
             I know!
   So what are you doing? Go!

929
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,786
      Okay. Well, let's see
    what we can salvage here.

930
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,746
            It's wet!

931
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,870
             [molly]
     so, where do we start?

932
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:33,188
     Do you want me to type?

933
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:34,965
         -Yeah, please.
             -Okay.

934
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,360
        "a christmas..."

935
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:39,594
              Ahh.

936
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,122
   All right, I've never done
  this type of writing before,

937
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,883
             But...

938
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:47,202
        Every story works
     basically the same way.

939
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,703
           It's about
       asking a question,

940
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:50,939
       And then searching
        for the answers.

941
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,651
       So, what "question"
      do we want to answer?

942
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,488
       If a christmas tree
       falls in the forest

943
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,565
    And there's nobody there
           to hear it,

944
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,733
  Does hank still get presents?

945
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,160
              Oh...

946
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,495
       Don't be so silly!
  We don't have time for this!

947
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:06,830
              Okay.

948
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:08,981
           Okay. Uh...

949
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:12,060
  I have a confession to make.

950
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:14,171
         I don't usually
      celebrate christmas.

951
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:16,155
              Yeah.

952
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,082
 I, uh, I figured that one out.

953
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,509
            Why not?

954
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,679
          Work, mostly.

955
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,256
   I was usually on assignment
      during christmas, so.

956
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,759
    Is that the only reason?

957
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,669
          Look at you--

958
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:31,095
   Probing like a journalist.

959
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,597
     Searching for answers.

960
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,265
             Touché.

961
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,267
        [both chuckling]

962
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,104
        With claire gone
          and no kids,

963
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,866
      Christmas was just...
    Another day, no big deal.

964
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,518
     That's very sad, hank.

965
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,095
      The funny thing is...

966
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:48,780
       I never thought so,
            honestly,

967
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,831
        Until I met you.

968
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,786
      Christmas brings you
          so much joy.

969
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,046
            [laughs]

970
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:57,772
           So, for me,
    what I would want to ask

971
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:01,033
          Is what is it
     about christmas, molly,

972
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,611
     That you love so much?

973
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,797
 Well, there are so many things
        I love about it.

974
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,615
              Like?

975
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:12,454
       The sound of carols
          everywhere...

976
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:15,214
  The-the shimmer of the tinsel
          in the trees,

977
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,359
  Spending time with my family.

978
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,402
            [laughs]

979
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,129
          At christmas,

980
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:23,031
      Everything just feels
          like a gift.

981
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,635
          Every moment
 just shines a little brighter.

982
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,914
            And love
   just wafts through the air

983
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,733
   Like the smell of cinnamon
           and ginger,

984
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,067
      And it just fills you
             with...

985
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,811
        [inhales deeply]

986
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,738
             [sighs]

987
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,507
          ...With love.

988
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,052
  It makes you warm and fuzzy.

989
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:47,430
        I think you made
      a believer out of me.

990
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:48,414
            In santa?

991
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,749
              Love.

992
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,251
              Ahem!

993
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,497
  You writing a christmas play
  or a harlequin romance novel?

994
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,332
       -No, we were just--
         -I was just...

995
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,850
        Whatever! Listen.

996
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,518
      We can't do anything
     with sets and costumes

997
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,112
     Until we have a script.

998
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,172
              So...

999
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,341
            Whatever
   your creative process is...

1000
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,266
           Chop-chop!

1001
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:08,952
          Okay. Gotcha.

1002
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,846
     Um, well, we will have
       it ready by-- when?

1003
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:13,197
            Tomorrow.

1004
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,517
  Tomorrow? No, we can't do it
          by tomorrow.

1005
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,961
    You know, I think you two
       will figure it out.

1006
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,205
          As you were.

1007
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,091
           [chuckles]

1008
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,860
              Yeah.

1009
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,470
            -Busted.
            -Busted.

1010
00:38:27,622 --> 00:38:29,714
           [laughing]

1011
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,049
           -All right!
             -Okay.

1012
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,225
         Let's do this.

1013
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,371
           We did it.

1014
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,963
    Don't sound so surprised.

1015
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:39,482
   I had complete faith in us.

1016
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,300
           Ha! Me too.

1017
00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:44,321
        Still gonna need
        a polish, but...

1018
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,231
      ...I think it's good.

1019
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:49,326
      We make a good team.

1020
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,980
              Yeah.

1021
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,499
 We've got a lot of work to do.

1022
00:38:56,726 --> 00:38:58,984
       You know something?

1023
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,229
            I'm glad
     your plans got upended

1024
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,247
    And you had to come here
         for christmas.

1025
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:06,468
      You're the best gift
    I've had in a long time.

1026
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:10,513
       I'll walk you out.

1027
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,021
              Mom.

1028
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:19,747
             [sighs]

1029
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:21,524
     Okay. I know it's late,
           but we were

1030
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,194
     Writing the new script,
   got completely caught up--

1031
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,754
       No, um, you missed
       tofino's swim meet.

1032
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,756
             [gasps]

1033
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:31,534
         [sighing] oh...
      I completely forgot.

1034
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:32,610
         Oh, I'm sorry.

1035
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,429
          -It happens.
            -No! No.

1036
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:35,763
    It does not happen to me.

1037
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:37,022
        Oh! I'm so sorry.

1038
00:39:37,117 --> 00:39:38,875
         Mom, it's okay.

1039
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,785
       Really, it's okay.
   It's just that she's, um...

1040
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:42,045
    She's waiting up for you.

1041
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:45,048
              [♪♪]

1042
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,706
          Hey, sweetie.

1043
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,040
             Gammy!

1044
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,375
            I'm sorry
    I missed your swim meet.

1045
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:57,894
         I won the race!

1046
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,396
               Oh!

1047
00:39:59,623 --> 00:40:02,306
      I am so proud of you,
      my little sugar-plum.

1048
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,975
               Oh!

1049
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,144
     I wish I'd been there.

1050
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:07,645
  I was a little sad at first,

1051
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,313
     But then mommy told me

1052
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,633
       That even if people
    aren't there physically,

1053
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,058
      They're always there
       inside our hearts.

1054
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,318
            Gammy...

1055
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,703
      You were in my heart.

1056
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,640
      And you were in mine.

1057
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:19,916
               Mm.

1058
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,162
       Do you want to know
   what my christmas wish is?

1059
00:40:24,314 --> 00:40:25,830
            Mm. What?

1060
00:40:25,982 --> 00:40:29,150
       That you could stay
     with us forever, and...

1061
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,501
 And a sparkle-rainbow unicorn.

1062
00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:31,669
           A real one.

1063
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,838
  Well, that's a very big wish.

1064
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,266
 We might have to rely on santa
       for that one, okay?

1065
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,934
           [chuckles]

1066
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,179
    Did mom really say that?

1067
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,680
              Yep.

1068
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:44,274
      She has her moments.

1069
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,775
            [laughs]

1070
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:49,112
         [quietly] yeah.

1071
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,691
          So, everyone,
     here's the new script.

1072
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,026
    It's about an old elf...

1073
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,178
          Played by me!

1074
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,938
         ...Who has lost
      his christmas spirit,

1075
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,181
 And in order to find it again,

1076
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,699
     He has to make his wish

1077
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,201
      On a christmas star--

1078
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,794
          Played by me.

1079
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:06,963
   And he makes a few friends
         along the way,

1080
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,447
   And when he finally reaches
       the christmas star,

1081
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,799
          She tells him

1082
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:11,042
    That he has all the love
        he's ever needed

1083
00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:12,360
             Inside,

1084
00:41:12,378 --> 00:41:13,861
    And that he doesn't need
         to make a wish

1085
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,379
      Because he's his own
         christmas star.

1086
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:16,639
              Aww!

1087
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,624
           It's called
       <i> a christmas spark.</i>

1088
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:21,478
            [laughs]
     this sounds fantastic.

1089
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:22,870
   Well, I mean, it's gonna be
         a lot of work,

1090
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:24,481
           But I know
      you can pull it off.

1091
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,224
      We're going to raise
         so much money!

1092
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,558
     Oh, that's a good thing

1093
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,635
     Because that roof leak
     caused a lot of damage.

1094
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:31,229
   This all sounds wonderful,

1095
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:34,115
    But what are we gonna do
    about costumes and props?

1096
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,236
      I got more donations!

1097
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,737
          [all hooting]

1098
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,499
      Whoa! The townspeople
      really came through.

1099
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,742
       I knew they would!

1100
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,486
   This is all I could salvage
     from the storage room.

1101
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,412
      And I'm not too sure
         about this hat.

1102
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,506
     It smells like cheese.

1103
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,323
           [chuckling]

1104
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,825
  You covered the war in iraq,

1105
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:55,178
      You slept in mud huts
         in the amazon,

1106
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:56,679
       You went undercover

1107
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:59,090
     For the backstreet boys
         fan convention,

1108
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,518
      And you can't handle
    a little stinky elf hat?

1109
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:03,019
            Smell it.

1110
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:04,187
            [laughs]

1111
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:06,597
   You're getting soft, hank.

1112
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,583
       You're going to be
     an adorable elf, hank.

1113
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:10,434
        Yeah, very elf-y.

1114
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,587
       You are going to be
   a pretty, pretty princess.

1115
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,013
       Now, why don't you
        go back in there

1116
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,106
        And see what else
        you can salvage?

1117
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,257
           -Come here.
             -What?

1118
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:19,202
         [quietly] oh...

1119
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:21,095
   I was wondering if I could
    cook you dinner tonight,

1120
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:23,206
     Kind of as a thank-you
 for all your help on the play?

1121
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:24,356
       [hushed] you cook?

1122
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,876
          Yeah, molly,
       I'm a modern man--

1123
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,211
       I cook, I clean...

1124
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,622
     I follow chrissy teigan
          on instagram.

1125
00:42:31,775 --> 00:42:32,549
           Oh, me too!

1126
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,969
         I don't really.
      Will you still come?

1127
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,281
              Yeah.
       I'll bring dessert.

1128
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,949
               Oh!

1129
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,301
             7:00...

1130
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,969
              7:00.

1131
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,479
          See you then.

1132
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:55,405
             Spill.

1133
00:42:55,632 --> 00:42:57,298
              What?

1134
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,801
 Woman, your cheeks are blushing
   more than a bottle of rosé.

1135
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,652
             [bunny]
  we've known hank a long time,

1136
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,396
     And I've never seen him
     like this with anyone.

1137
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,231
          The director
         and the star...

1138
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:07,750
           So cliché,
         yet so poetic!

1139
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:08,918
           [giggling]

1140
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,087
   There is nothing going on.

1141
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:12,496
              Oh...

1142
00:43:12,649 --> 00:43:13,739
       [sighs reluctantly]

1143
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,908
          Look, I mean,
     he's fun to be around,

1144
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,260
         And he's cute,

1145
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:19,337
   But I'm only gonna be here
      for a few more weeks.

1146
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:22,323
   Which is why it's perfect--
        a holiday fling!

1147
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:24,008
          Just for fun.
          Just for you.

1148
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,326
    [liana] careful, though.

1149
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:28,329
       Ayako was supposed
        to be my rebound.

1150
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,014
         20 years later,
      we're still bouncing.

1151
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,349
         [liana laughs]

1152
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,592
 Do you want to know the truth?

1153
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:36,428
     I haven't dated anyone
        since greg died.

1154
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,189
             And...

1155
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:41,025
         I can't imagine
     being with anyone else.

1156
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:42,860
             [sighs]

1157
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:46,013
 But I also can't imagine being
 alone for the rest of my life.

1158
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:48,349
    [bunny] after my divorce,

1159
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:50,943
            I thought
   I would never get over it.

1160
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,370
     Yeah, it took a while,

1161
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,796
            But now?

1162
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:56,633
       I am living my life
          for me again!

1163
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,526
            Oh... Oh!

1164
00:43:58,544 --> 00:44:00,211
        It feels so good.

1165
00:44:00,363 --> 00:44:02,472
      But that's the thing
      about getting older.

1166
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:05,366
        I don't have time
to live by other people's rules.

1167
00:44:05,385 --> 00:44:07,292
        I live by my own.

1168
00:44:07,387 --> 00:44:09,145
   Yesterday, she made a rule

1169
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:12,039
         She gets to eat
ice-cream sundaes for breakfast.

1170
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:13,708
           [laughing]

1171
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:15,726
      "sundaes on sundays!"
    how is this not a thing?

1172
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,820
      It should be a thing!

1173
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,881
      [bunny] and whatever
      your thing is, molly,

1174
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:22,566
         Now is the time
       to just go for it.

1175
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,077
              [♪♪]

1176
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,631
     Whatever you're making
        smells delicious.

1177
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,734
    It's an argentinean stew.

1178
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:41,344
      Part of what I loved
          about my job

1179
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:42,753
          Is that I got
         to really learn

1180
00:44:42,906 --> 00:44:44,405
        About the places
        that I traveled.

1181
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:46,090
   What else did you learn...

1182
00:44:46,242 --> 00:44:47,684
      Besides how to cook?

1183
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:53,672
     [music begins to play]

1184
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:55,007
     Come on, I'll show you.

1185
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,918
          Show me what?

1186
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:58,194
              [♪♪]

1187
00:44:58,345 --> 00:45:00,179
          How to tango.

1188
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,680
      I thought you told me
       you couldn't dance?

1189
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,848
            I can't.

1190
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,091
            [laughs]

1191
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,776
          Well, I can,

1192
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:07,370
      So why don't you just
      follow my lead, hmm?

1193
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:10,331
              [♪♪]

1194
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,547
           [laughing]

1195
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:21,676
      You have three feet!

1196
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:27,298
       Why don't you lead?

1197

00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,871
           Here it is.

1255
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:58,265
    I was... Five years old,

1256
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:00,768
  And my sister was teasing me,

1257
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:02,269
   Because she said that I was

1258
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:05,214
    The only kid on the block
  who still believed in santa.

1259
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:09,276
  So, I decided to prove to her
   that year that santa was...

1260
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:10,202
            For real.

00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,612
          Good for you!

1262
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:13,280
   Yeah. So, on christmas eve,

1263
00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:15,725
   I stayed up all night long,

1264
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,636
          Waiting with
    my trusty little camera,

1265
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,956
   To catch that jolly old elf
as he shimmied down the chimney.

1266
00:48:21,974 --> 00:48:22,806
              And?

1267
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,308
         I fell asleep.

1268
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,309
               Ah.

1269
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:28,720
      But, when I woke up,

1270
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,314
           Everything
 that I had wanted for christmas

1271
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:31,908
      Was under that tree.

00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:33,409
              Wow.

1273
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,912
       So, did your sister
        change her mind?

               No.

 waking up on christmas morning

01:05:22,994 --> 01:05:24,644
           Hey, hank--

1643
01:05:24,663 --> 01:05:26,922
              [♪♪]

1644
01:05:33,488 --> 01:05:35,913
         I'm gonna have
     santa's sleigh here...

1645
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,340
    Yeah, just around there,
      that should be good.

1646
01:05:37,492 --> 01:05:38,266
             Molly?

1647
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:41,419
    Molly, we have a problem.

1648
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:42,753
            I know--
       the last monologue.

1649
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:43,846
    I'm still working on it.

1650
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:44,847
 No, no, no, no, n-not that. No.

1651
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,274
    We've sold enough tickets

1652
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:48,351
        To cover the cost
     of the new set pieces,

1653
01:05:48,503 --> 01:05:50,336
    But now we have to cover
      repairs on the roof,

1654
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:52,522
            And I-I--

1655
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:54,691
    And even if we sell out,
       there's not enough.

1656
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,117
    So what are we gonna do?

1657
01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:57,619
      I don't-- we're gonna
    have to cut arts programs

1658
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:58,845
     And re-allocate funds.

1659
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:00,196
   There must be a better way.

1660
01:06:00,348 --> 01:06:01,514
            [sighing]

1661
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:03,607
    I'll think of something,
           I promise.

1662
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,276
              Here.

1663
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:07,629
     -You go back and rest.
             -Yeah.

1664
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,539
     I'm a little run-down.

1665
01:06:09,691 --> 01:06:10,948
             Ohh...

1666
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,451
       I'm so glad to have
    somebody like you around

1667
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,952
      To pick up the slack.

1668
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,196
     I'll see you tomorrow?

1669
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:17,764
        See you tomorrow.

1670
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:31,394
  [hank] yeah, I like this one.
        It's much better.

1671
01:06:31,546 --> 01:06:33,655
      That's quite a look.

1672
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:36,783
           [chuckles]
          it is, right?

1673
01:06:38,478 --> 01:06:40,720
   I, uh, I wasn't sure about
   the tights at first, but...

1674
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:42,572
  I got some really nice legs.

1675
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,315
     Well, the pointy shoes
           help, too.

1676
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,001
              Yeah.

1677
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:48,837
      -How are you feeling?
          -I'm nervous,

1678
01:06:49,064 --> 01:06:51,581
     But, uh... I feel good,
           I'm ready.

1679
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,008
        No, I mean, um...

1680
01:06:53,235 --> 01:06:55,010
        I'm really sorry
      about your ornament.

1681
01:06:56,496 --> 01:06:57,846
  Hank, you already apologized.

1682
01:06:57,997 --> 01:06:59,756
         I know, but...

1683
01:06:59,908 --> 01:07:03,000
       I know how it feels
    to lose someone you love.

1684
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,079
        You wanna hold on
    to every piece of them--

1685
01:07:06,097 --> 01:07:07,597
        No pun intended--

1686
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,691
        And I could tell

1687
01:07:09,842 --> 01:07:12,027
      That that star meant
          a lot to you.

1688
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:21,018
  My daughter helped me realize
           that, uh...

1689
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:23,613
      You can let things go

1690
01:07:23,765 --> 01:07:25,782
       And still hold them
      close to your heart.

1691
01:07:25,934 --> 01:07:28,117
          She's right.

1692
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,103
     It also occurred to me

1693
01:07:30,121 --> 01:07:32,881
     That maybe, sometimes,
         you have to...

1694
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:34,865
         Smash something
      into a hundred pieces

1695
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:36,292
         Before you can

1696
01:07:36,444 --> 01:07:37,886
     Piece it back together
      into something new...

1697
01:07:40,965 --> 01:07:42,515
         ...Someone new.

1698
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:47,136
       That's very poetic.

1699
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,022
           Thank you.

1700
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:54,903
   Can you come over tonight?

1701
01:07:56,314 --> 01:07:57,072
     Last-minute rehearsals?

1702
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,314
               No.

1703
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:00,241
     I'm working on a story,

1704
01:08:00,393 --> 01:08:02,726
    And I just need some help
        with the ending.

1705
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,412
           Is this for
   the class you're teaching?

1706
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:06,748
        No. This is, um,
       something personal.

1707
01:08:12,314 --> 01:08:14,255
 Are you always this mysterious?

1708
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,718
             Maybe.

1709
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:23,598
              7:00?

1710
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:27,102
             Seven.

1711
01:08:30,256 --> 01:08:31,681
           -[laughing]
            -[clink]

1712
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:35,335
     So what was that story
  you wanted to tell me about?

1713
01:08:35,353 --> 01:08:36,853
             -Uh...
              -Hmm?

1714
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:38,947
        Once upon a time,

1715
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:42,933
            There was
  this very charming, handsome,

1716
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:44,768
         Talented man--

1717
01:08:44,863 --> 01:08:46,604
   Ha. It's a fiction, right?

1718
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,289
     ...And all he wanted...
           -[laughing]

1719
01:08:48,516 --> 01:08:51,367
     ...Was a box of taffy--
         a box of taffy!

1720
01:08:51,519 --> 01:08:53,611
  But some beautiful little elf
       stole it from him.

1721
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,021
        I did not steal!

1722
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:56,780
   And she didn't stop there.

1723
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:57,799
       Oh, no, she didn't!

1724
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,542
    She then stole his time,

1725
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,711
        By convincing him
  to be in her christmas play.

1726
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,212
          Oh-- [laughs]

1727
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:05,140
         Next, she stole
         his motorcycle.

1728
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,532
           No, no, no.
      You lent that to me.

1729
01:09:06,626 --> 01:09:08,368
         She even stole
       his grinchiness...

1730
01:09:08,461 --> 01:09:09,869
             -Ohh...
    -...When she invited him

1731
01:09:09,888 --> 01:09:12,054
        Over to her house
  to decorate a christmas tree.

1732
01:09:12,207 --> 01:09:13,723
               Mm.

1733
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,650
    Ah, but there's one thing
   she didn't have to steal...

1734
01:09:15,877 --> 01:09:17,301
          His heart...

1735
01:09:17,395 --> 01:09:18,778
   Because he gave it to her.

1736
01:09:20,715 --> 01:09:23,399
 I've been all over this world,
         molly foreman,

1737
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:25,493
      But there's no place
  that makes me feel like I do

1738
01:09:25,645 --> 01:09:26,828
       When I'm with you.

1739
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:30,239
    You're a dream come true.

1740
01:09:30,392 --> 01:09:31,833
    And I thought it was time

1741
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,626
          That someone
   made your dreams come true.

1742
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:35,986
        Let's go outside.

1743
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,246
        There's something
       I want to show you.

1744
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:39,132
            Come on.

1745
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:43,344
              [♪♪]

1746
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,347
             Hank...

1747
01:09:49,411 --> 01:09:51,019
      Greg always promised
  he'd take me to the pyramids

1748
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:53,021
       When we retired...

1749
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,507
         I'll take you.

1750
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:58,418
     Stay here. Don't leave.

1751
01:09:58,436 --> 01:10:00,862
       We can go to egypt.
       We can go anywhere.

1752
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:02,922
            I thought
   we were "just having fun".

1753
01:10:02,941 --> 01:10:04,199
             We are.

1754
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:06,034
          So why stop?

1755
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:08,110
            I'm ready
  for the next chapter, molly.

1756
01:10:08,263 --> 01:10:10,038
            Are you?

1757
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,216
            I can't.

1758
01:10:22,944 --> 01:10:26,012
  Please, just think about it.
             Please?

1759
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,182
        I'm sorry, hank.

1760
01:10:32,303 --> 01:10:33,394
         I've got to go.

1761
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:35,897
              [♪♪]

1762
01:10:49,562 --> 01:10:51,412
       Are you waiting up
          for me again?

1763
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:55,141
               No.

1764
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:56,976
   I must have fallen asleep.

1765
01:10:56,995 --> 01:11:00,646
      I was... Researching
   how to sell things online.

1766
01:11:00,665 --> 01:11:02,406
        Mm. Selling what?

1767
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,499
             Taffy.

1768
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,426
           Oh. Right.

1769
01:11:09,491 --> 01:11:10,598
             Try it.

1770
01:11:10,825 --> 01:11:12,934
             I think
  I've finally figured it out.

1771
01:11:29,177 --> 01:11:30,176
               Mm!

1772
01:11:30,194 --> 01:11:31,344
         It's delicious.

1773
01:11:31,362 --> 01:11:32,787
             I know.

1774
01:11:32,938 --> 01:11:34,697
      It tastes like, um...

1775
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,939
           [munching]

1776
01:11:36,034 --> 01:11:37,274
     ...A gingerbread house.

1777
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:38,851
       [chuckles proudly]

1778
01:11:38,944 --> 01:11:41,537
     And I have eggnog ones
         and candy cane,

1779
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:43,798
   And even burnt marshmallow.

1780
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:45,967
       A christmas taffy?
       This is brilliant.

1781
01:11:46,118 --> 01:11:47,693
           [chuckles]

1782
01:11:47,712 --> 01:11:49,879
     Well, tofino likes it,
 so that's the important thing.

1783
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:52,307
 I don't even know what to say.
          I'm shocked!

1784
01:11:53,885 --> 01:11:55,143
    No, no, honey, I didn't--

1785
01:11:55,294 --> 01:11:56,644
   I really didn't mean that.
            I just--

1786
01:11:56,871 --> 01:12:00,148
   Look, I know that you think
      I'm a bit of a mess.

1787
01:12:00,299 --> 01:12:02,800
           But I try.

1788
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:06,821
      It's just really hard
   living up to you sometimes.

1789
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:11,159
         Can I tell you
        a little secret?

1790
01:12:12,737 --> 01:12:14,645
       When I was younger,

1791
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,331
           I felt like
     I did everything wrong,

1792
01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:19,408
     And I was-- I was sure

1793
01:12:19,561 --> 01:12:21,485
       That you were gonna
    end up damaged for life.

1794
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,896
            [laughs]

1795
01:12:23,915 --> 01:12:27,842
      I had to teach myself
 how to be a mom in my own way.

1796
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:31,921
     And not emulate my mom
          or my friends

1797
01:12:32,073 --> 01:12:34,182
    Or those perfect tv moms.

1798
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,853
        I wasn't my mom.

1799
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:43,191
       And you're not me.
   I wouldn't want you to be.

1800
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:48,921
   Well, that's the last thing
           I expected

1801
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:51,366
   To come out of your mouth.

1802
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:53,517
       Oh, no. I'm sorry.

1803
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:54,777
            I go on.

1804
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:57,096
    It must drive you crazy--

1805
01:12:57,115 --> 01:12:59,207
     I'm always telling you
how to do things and what to do.

1806
01:13:01,936 --> 01:13:03,603
     You don't need to agree
        quite so quickly.

1807
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:05,380
         [both laughing]

1808
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:11,219
              I...

1810
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:15,448
      ...I guess I've been

1811
01:13:15,466 --> 01:13:18,059
     Trying to use your life
     to fill up my own life.

1812
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,065
         And I'm sorry.

1813
01:13:26,144 --> 01:13:28,552
        But you, you have

1814
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:31,572
       The most beautiful,
    unique spark, kristen...

1815
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:36,702
       ...And I don't ever
         want to dim it.

1816
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:41,916
    You have your own spark,
            too, mom.

1817
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,752
    You just have to use it.

1818
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:49,215
           It's time.

1819
01:13:54,413 --> 01:13:56,764
  Hank wants me to stay here...

1820
01:13:58,993 --> 01:14:01,269
          ...And travel
   around the world with him.

1821
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,939
     And start a new chapter
            together.

1822
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:08,067
              Well?

1823
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,449
            I can't.

1824
01:14:19,681 --> 01:14:21,289
        -Because of dad?
      -[chokes up] mm-hmm.

1825
01:14:24,276 --> 01:14:27,186
         Do you remember
        a few years ago,

1826
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:28,796
         Tofino told you

1827
01:14:28,948 --> 01:14:30,781
  That she didn't want to have
   a little brother or sister,

1828
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:32,875
     Because she was worried

1829
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:35,094
        That steve and I
   wouldn't love her as much?

1830
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,474
     What did you tell her?

1831
01:14:41,052 --> 01:14:42,702
      That the heart grows

1832
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,979
      To hold all the love
       that you put in it.

1833
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:46,981
         You don't have
       to stop loving dad

1834
01:14:47,132 --> 01:14:48,316
     In order to love hank.

1835
01:14:50,378 --> 01:14:54,304
  Mom, your heart is so big...
        It can handle it.

1836
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,974
   You just have to open it up
   to let the love flow in...

1837
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,160
            And out.

1838
01:15:02,223 --> 01:15:04,999
      How did you ever get
         to be so wise?

1839
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:08,836
    Well, I have my moments.

1840
01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:11,839
            And I had
     a pretty good teacher.

              -Hi.

1848
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:16,962
        It's the big day.
         Are you ready?

1849
01:16:16,981 --> 01:16:18,239
   I feel good about the show,

1850
01:16:18,466 --> 01:16:19,890
         But I'm worried
    it's not gonna be enough.

1851
01:16:19,984 --> 01:16:21,300
   I thought it was sold out?

1852
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:22,818
  It is, but bunny just told me

1853
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:24,394
        That the estimate
         for the repairs

1854
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:26,063
    Exceeds what we can make,

1855
01:16:26,157 --> 01:16:28,082
   Even with a sold-out show.

1856
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:30,901
 The problem is, the venue just
   doesn't hold enough people.

1857
01:16:30,995 --> 01:16:32,661
     [inhales sharply] oh...

1858
01:16:32,814 --> 01:16:33,588
              What?

1859
01:16:35,074 --> 01:16:38,075
            Nothing!
   You just focus on the show.

1860
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,428
        I have a feeling
  everything's gonna work out.

1861

             [sighs]

1862
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:53,515

     so-- so many nights...

1863
01:16:53,668 --> 01:16:55,517
        [sighs nervously]
         so many nights.

1864
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:59,113

            Hi there.

01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:08,122
               Hi.

1867
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,917
  -I'm sorry about last night--
          -no, no, no!

1868
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,629
  No, I'm the one that's sorry.

1869
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,523
     You offered me a dream

1870
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:19,425
      And I was too afraid
        to make it real.

1871
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:23,787
     I had a wonderful life
          with greg...

1872
01:17:23,881 --> 01:17:26,790
   But my life isn't over yet.

1873
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:30,202
      You make me feel like
      I could do anything,

1874
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,538
     And for the first time
        in a long time...

1875
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:35,441
        The future looks
     full of possibilities.

1876
01:17:40,398 --> 01:17:42,548
 I don't have to stop loving him
          to love you.

 -Kristen made me realize that--
            -no, j--

1878
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:48,954
        Did you just say
          you love me?

1879
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:51,791
        I... Guess I did.

1880
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:53,834
        I love you, too.

           Uh, sorry.

1884
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,752
  Uh, I found a way to help us
    pay for the roof repairs.

1885
01:18:03,905 --> 01:18:04,845
      I sold more tickets.

1886
01:18:05,072 --> 01:18:06,906
        Kristen, we don't
        have enough seats

1887
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:07,848
  To accommodate more people--
         we're sold out!

1888
01:18:08,075 --> 01:18:09,183
             I know.

1889
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:11,352
           That's why
     I started a livestream.

1890
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,354
  Steve and tofino are already
     setting up the camera.

1891
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:14,838
        You sold tickets
        to a live stream?

1892
01:18:14,932 --> 01:18:18,192
  Yeah. To the tune of $2,000!

          Holy smokes.

   I'm also gonna give a free
  sample of my christmas taffy

1897
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,259
           Oh! I mean,
     they're gonna love it.

1898
01:18:27,278 --> 01:18:29,203

      customers lining up.

     Well, you've cleaned up
      enough of my messes.

           It was nice
    to help you out for once.

 How did I ever get lucky enough
          to have you?

         What about me?
