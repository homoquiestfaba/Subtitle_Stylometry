1
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,000
<i>Good morning.
Get out of bed, sleepyhead.</i>

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,157
<i>It's 6am in NYC, the place to be.</i>

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,838
<i>You're listening to the Big Q,</i>

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,190
<i>the place to be
for all the best music in town.</i>

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,953
Are you OK?

6
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,597
You're all sweaty.

7
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,996
I just had a hot dream.

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,190
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

9
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,276
Starring me?

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,671
- Among others.
- You wiseass, Artie.

11
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,078
This girl knows her pressure points.

12
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,195
Yeah. All of 'em.

13
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,354
Reet.

14
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,870
I can't do this. I have to go to work.
Stevie's waiting for me. OK?

15
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,274
Just wait right here, OK?
And I'll be right back.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,753
- Right back?
- 12 hours.

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,950
- Artie.
- I swear I'll be back in 12 hours.

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,356
My hero.

19
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,512
Tough day at the office.

20
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,436
What happened to Stevie?

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,949
You're a better kisser than Stevie.

22
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,439
- Daddy wins again!
- Daddy wins again! Yeah!

23
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,836
- Don't you ever sleep, Daddy?
- Policemen never sleep.

24
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,988
- Especially when people need breakfast.
- I need waffles, Daddy.

25
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,588
And I need a bagel with raisins on it.

26
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,472
And a flat egg.

27
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,719
Let me ask you something.

28
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,559
Am I a father or am I a short-order man?

29
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,796
A short-order man!

30
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,957
You bunch of wise guys!
You know what we do with wise guys?

31
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,196
- What?
- We take them to the police station

32
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,515
and we give them the huggy torture!

33
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,917
Hey, girls.

34
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,634
I think I pulled a muscle
in my leg this morning.

35
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,512
- You should smoke one of these.
- Why?

36
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,631
Well, I haven't got a pulled muscle.

37
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,988
What did the doc say?

38
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,793
She's still got to have
two insulin shots a day.

39
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,596
- She can still lead a normal life, though?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,234
- She's just scared of the needles.
- Yeah.

41
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,918
She's a kid. She's a baby.

42
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,996
- I'm scared of the needles.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,998
- She's such a cute little one.
- She's beautiful.

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,749
- Who gives her the shots? You?
- Yeah. She's too young.

45
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,840
Detective Lewis, 27th squad.
How you doing?

46
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,915
How you doing?

47
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,919
He don't know nothing about them dope
dealers. He was home with me all night.

48
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,632
That's all right. No problem.

49
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,797
We're looking for help.
Four guys were shot here last night.

50
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,354
Those boys want to make a quick buck.

51
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,710
Death is the dues and they know it.

52
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,753
Why don't you take care of those people
who are terrorised every day?

53
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,279
We're trying, sir.

54
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,710
You cops are getting rich off that shit.
Who are you fooling?

55
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,475
You hear anything, you give us a call.

56
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,313
Yeah. Sure.

57
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,389
- Think we're gonna hear from them?
- No. I don't think so.

58
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,430
Let's get out of here, babe.

59
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,269
You know what you need to do?
You need to start going out more.

60
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,356
Artie, will you stop with that?

61
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,438
- I'm just saying, you know.
- I don't have time to date.

62
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,357
Shit, the lights are off.

63
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,199
- Step into my office.
- All right.

64
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,278
Just be cool, all right? Just chill, man.

65
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,069
Get over there!

66
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,038
All right.

67
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,799
Man, get your ass up against the wall.

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,831
This ain't no landlord. He's a cop!

69
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,679
So what, man? Cops got money too.

70
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,597
You better cool it before it's too late.

71
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,678
So you promise
you won't bust us if we let you go?

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,552
We gonna play this shit out.

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,636
- Take him to the basement.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,876
Check it out. I got a stack on my ankle.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,468
Private money. Take it.
I don't know nothing.

76
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,668
Go on, do it, man.

77
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,791
Look at you now, cop.

78
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,990
Fucking cops!

79
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,951
I got their asses right here.

80
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,990
Come here! I got you now!

81
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,472
Get outta here!

82
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,951
Thanks, man.

83
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,113
Are we alive, partner?

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,835
We're alive. We're alive.

85
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,394
They're jumping cops down there.
What's this world coming to?

86
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,836
Felix, do we look like landlords to you?

87
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,236
To a dude with lightning in his eyeballs,
you look like money.

88
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,998
These dudes are ice climbers.

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,112
It's all about the 12 hours of power.
It's crazy.

90
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,515
- What's happening?
- Fisticuffs at your age?

91
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,313
I know.
Tell me if my back fillings are in there.

92
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,595
Quinn at 11 o'clock, fellas.

93
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,716
You all right?

94
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,956
Well, a little winded, boss.

95
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,348
You want us to write this up
as drug-related?

96
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,597
Why? No drugs found,
no proof of drug involvement.

97
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,472
Come on, man.

98
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,319
You think they'd jump two cops
if they weren't whacked?

99
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,829
Want to put them in jail
or in a treatment programme?

100
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,428
Under a bus. They tried to kill me.

101
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,676
Write it up as attempted murder.

102
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,233
You don't have to testify.

103
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,272
I don't want some legal aid lawyer
saying I'm a liar

104
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,913
for withholding information.

105
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,156
The perps admitted that they were high.

106
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,918
Right.

107
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,038
OK. Include their statements if you want.

108
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,709
And the fact that
no drugs or paraphernalia were recovered.

109
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,592
Are you happy now, Lewis?

110
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,836
Delirious.

111
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,475
- He's cuter with those sores on.
- I think he's cute.

112
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,831
I am very cute. I'm known for my cuteness.

113
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,276
- City-wide.
- City-wide.

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,836
- There's Cheryl.
- Speaking of cute, she's cute, right?

115
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,758
Stash your drugs.
The joint is crawling with cops.

116
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,519
Yeah. There's Mr Happy Hour himself.

117
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,039
I'm gonna go on home.

118
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,913
No. Let's go across the street. I'm buying.

119
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,998
That's where the bad guys drink.
We're not welcome there.

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,557
You're welcome anywhere if you're with
me. I was raised in this neighbourhood.

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,511
What if they never liked you?

122
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,910
- I will never own another one of these.
- You never owned one of these.

123
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,110
- I've had three.
- You never did!

124
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,913
You never believe a thing I say.

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,399
Get in there.

126
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,676
Lighten up, everybody. It's that metal plate
I got stuck in my head. Relax.

127
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,110
I kinda like it here.

128
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,953
- Yeah.
- Good call, Felix.

129
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,709
The perfect place to kick back and relax
after a hard day's work.

130
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,990
We're gonna have to
shoot our way out of here.

131
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,519
Please don't say that.

132
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,993
- Give me them sticks.
- What for?

133
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,395
I want a light.

134
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,751
- You smoke too much.
- Leave me alone.

135
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,713
<i>- I can quit when I want.
- Mira, Eddie.</i>

136
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,308
Whatever you got on tap. Three.

137
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,713
What is this?

138
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,429
I need permission
to get a drink round here?

139
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,073
<i>Tranquilo, my friend.</i>

140
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,430
I just don't understand why you are here.

141
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,954
Policemen keep to themselves
where I come from.

142
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,433
They run with each other.

143
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,599
But you never see a policeman
where the businessmen drink.

144
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,358
Not in my country.

145
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,279
This ain't your country. It's mine.
My city. My neighbourhood.

146
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,630
This is Beniamino. He's too big for you.

147
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,637
Nobody's too big for me, babe.

148
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,069
I got 28,000 guys in my gang.
Understand?

149
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,236
Chill, Felix.

150
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,952
It's all right.

151
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,718
We're all friends here.

152
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,838
- I have to tear myself away.
- Knock yourself out.

153
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,635
- Jesus.
- What are you looking at?

154
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,709
Hey, doll. How you doing?

155
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,753
- You're late.
- Well, a little unwinding was in order.

156
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,837
Look at this. Got rear-ended by a gypsy
cab. The guy has zero insurance.

157
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,635
It's a ton of paperwork. It's a mess.

158
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,911
- Is Stevie OK?
- Are you kidding?

159
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,033
I'm with him eight years, he never even
gets a nosebleed. You want Chinese?

160
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,833
This cab... had knuckles.

161
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,712
Hon, I'm alive, right? Come here.

162
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,355
- Did you check out that empty store?
- On my lunch break.

163
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,870
- So what's up?
- It's about as big as a shoe box.

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,595
The guy wants $2,000 a month,
but he said he'll give me five years.

165
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,358
Oh, yeah?

166
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,840
Why is it that you get to hear about my day

167
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,599
but I'm not allowed to know
what happened to you?

168
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,476
Come on, Rita. You don't want to hear
the daily war story.

169
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,149
- I don't want to hear a lie either.
- It's not about lying.

170
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,510
I mean, it's about forgetting.

171
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,476
Why do I have to
unload my garbage on you?

172
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,637
lt'd make me feel better.
We could have a conversation.

173
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,876
It might even help you.

174
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,394
All right. You're right.

175
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,870
We should talk more.

176
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,911
I know.

177
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,830
Do we have to do it now?

178
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,079
- You just call Chinese, Artie, OK?
- All right. I will.

179
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,910
I'm serious.

180
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,190
You'll end up fighting over this guy.

181
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,555
This is Stevie. He's cute, right?

182
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,958
- He cooks.
- Thanks, anyway.

183
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,355
- What are you doing?
- I was goofing.

184
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,357
Looking out for you, man.

185
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,153
- Doing a little window shopping?
- Nah.

186
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,953
Goofing around.
I wouldn't know how to cheat anyway.

187
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,069
It's easy. You just lie and deny.

188
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,398
Rita's got cop eyes. I couldn't get away
with anything even if I wanted to.

189
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,353
- You think Lucille was stupid?
- No, I'm just...

190
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,916
You think she believed
those stories about extraditions?

191
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,349
- Steve, look...
- Let me tell you something.

192
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,755
Women always know.

193
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,237
They either put the wood to you
or let it slide, but they always know.

194
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,669
Lucille was a saint for putting up with me.

195
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,598
You're right, Steve, she was a great lady.

196
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,995
I think by this time she'd forget about it.

197
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,909
Right now she'd just want you
to concentrate on the girls.

198
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,031
Looking after your kids.

199
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,196
- Right?
- Yeah, she'd want that.

200
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,993
- All she cared about was her family.
- Right.

201
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,350
She never thought about herself.

202
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,316
Look what happened.

203
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,396
She gets sick...

204
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,790
and she dies.

205
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,830
It's a funny world, Artie.

206
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,390
I mean, look at Rita.

207
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,956
She's a great lady.
She tried so hard to have kids.

208
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,594
We're past that. We're doing OK.

209
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,636
What you have to do, Steve,
is take one day at a time.

210
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,512
I know, I know, I know.

211
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,359
- You want to take a sick day?
- No.

212
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,790
- You sure?
- I'd rather be on the street with you.

213
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,357
We alive, baby? Talk to me.

214
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,277
- Let's go find out.
- Kiss me. Give me a kiss.

215
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,515
Get off of me!

216
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,317
What's the matter with you?

217
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,318
- Move this out of here.
- I gotta stop wearing suits.

218
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,271
- What for?
- It doesn't look good.

219
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,358
Why don't you believe it
when I say you look good?

220
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,391
- It's a nice suit.
- I know.

221
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,670
Felix, you working now?

222
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,156
- That's a large miscreant you got there.
- Thanks for your concern.

223
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,317
<i>... you, your children,
relatives and neighbours.</i>

224
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,752
<i>The innocent victims
of this nation's drug war. Miami.</i>

225
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,236
This is the third time this month
I've been robbed. What are you gonna do?

226
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,952
- I know.
- Third time?

227
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,038
- That's actually not too bad.
- That's not.

228
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,039
The important thing is,
where are we gonna have lunch today?

229
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,836
You're thinking about lunch already.

230
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,633
- I'm hungry.
- Don't get comfortable, Lewis.

231
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,751
Come on. The both of you.

232
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,749
- Speaking of fun guys.
- Yeah.

233
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,430
- Good coffee today.
- Yeah? I made it.

234
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,471
- Before you.
- No, darling, please...

235
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,068
Yeah, come on. Come on.

236
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,670
You know a guy named Mickey Garrett?

237
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,518
- Yeah.
- Neighbourhood lowlife. Crack junkie.

238
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,995
He was holding people up
outside cash machines.

239
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,509
- Garrett says you set him up.
- Come on.

240
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,231
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

241
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,396
Are you setting me up for something?

242
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,195
- This guy has a bad beef with you.
- What for? We helped him.

243
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,390
He just took his wife and kids hostage.

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,594
Stay behind the barricades.

245
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,438
Come on, Mickey! Come on!

246
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,676
Who's the tough guy? Wanna get some?

247
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,438
Yeah, man, do it up!

248
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,278
Your main man's got himself a jackpot.

249
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,790
Don't worry. He'll boogie
right past all you motherfuckers.

250
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,797
Look at this, Stevie.

251
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,156
Drop the video camera!

252
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,394
Lewis, this whole party's for you, my son!

253
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,952
- I see you, motherfucker...
- Shut the fuck up!

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,195
- I see you. Come on.
- Mickey!

255
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,713
- Second right!
- I see him.

256
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,876
Let's go.

257
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,151
- Let's go, Danny.
- I'm coming.

258
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,477
- This is strictly voluntary.
- Yeah, I know.

259
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,477
Hi, Cheryl. What's happening?

260
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,070
He's got a cigarette jones from
all that dope. Maybe this'll work you in.

261
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,316
Come on, Lewis, let's go.

262
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,439
All right?

263
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,313
This is Lieutenant Farrell
from hostage negotiation.

264
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,556
They told you this was voluntary?

265
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,114
- Yeah.
- He's been smoking ice.

266
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,037
He's in a psychotic state.

267
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,634
That's his wife. He's been pulling her
around, sticking that cannon in her face.

268
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,990
She's scared to death.

269
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,554
The wife always gets the worst of it.

270
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,114
He's got two kids too. Where are they?

271
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,595
- We haven't seen them.
- Let's go.

272
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,790
Let's do it. All right. Let's go.

273
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,159
Watch yourself when you're in there.

274
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,952
Mickey?

275
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,710
Mickey Garrett!

276
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,513
Come on in! The door's open!

277
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,353
Shit!

278
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,476
What are you trying to do, Mickey?
Booby-trap this place?

279
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,278
Mick, what's up?

280
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,789
It's different than it was last time.

281
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,553
Last time you called me a mutt, Lewis.
Bet you're sorry you didn't kill me.

282
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,070
If I wanted to kill you,
there's this invention called a gun.

283
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,079
Know what I'm saying?

284
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,838
That's not what happened last time.

285
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,873
You promised you were gonna stay clean
for your wife and kids.

286
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,356
- Right?
- I went and got dirty again, man.

287
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,396
- That shit's gonna kill you, Mick.
- Wrong, cop, wrong.

288
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,752
This ain't no playground goof.
This is superfreeze. 12 hours of power.

289
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,871
If it's that good, we should try some.

290
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,469
Cops can't get into this, man.

291
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,194
Cops and bitches are all about
stopping a man having fun.

292
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,958
Like this bitch over here.

293
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,713
<i>El tremendo bitch.</i>

294
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,195
Mickey! Don't hurt your wife, Mickey.

295
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,435
He's gonna hurt her.

296
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,232
- What's the matter with you?
- He'll kill her.

297
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,432
- Stay right there. Don't you move.
- You stay down, bitch.

298
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,314
- He's gonna give her up.
- What's the matter with you?

299
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,634
Mickey. How could a nice girl like that
spoil any of your fun?

300
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,479
I'm dealing ice, two bills a night.

301
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,995
- She'd rather I was a messenger.
- I'm going in the kitchen.

302
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,475
She tells me to get out of the deal.

303
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,955
I tell her I'm in. There ain't no getting out.

304
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,117
She says she's gonna call Detective Lewis.

305
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,118
Detective fucking Lewis
who locked me up the first time.

306
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,037
I say, "You don't gotta call him."

307
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,118
- "I'm gonna call him for you."
- No! God!

308
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,312
- Here he is, like I promised you.
- It isn't her fault!

309
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,876
Mick, think about your boys.

310
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,515
That's right. You don't want them
to see you hurt their mother.

311
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,995
You're bringing up them kids right.

312
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,838
Don't hurt 'em.

313
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,073
Gunshot don't hurt.

314
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,873
Bullet goes whack and you go black.

315
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,671
And then Jesus'll take 'em!

316
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,758
After the father he gave 'em,
he owes 'em something, right?

317
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,110
Mick, let me ask you something.

318
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,836
Do you always take those boys out to play?

319
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,633
Don't you go out and play ball with them
all the time?

320
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,752
You gotta start 'em young
if you want 'em to be any good.

321
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,793
That's right. I bet you buy them
everything they want too, don't you?

322
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,434
When one of their boys has something,
they got to have it.

323
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,358
He-Man, GI Joe, Ghostbusters...

324
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,678
I know you got those... building kits
and bikes you gotta put together.

325
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,112
- Those instructions'll drive you nuts.
- Because the plans don't make sense.

326
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,437
Companies want to make you
look a chump in front of your kids.

327
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,994
Loving your kids
doesn't make you a chump.

328
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,271
Doesn't mean you can't
blow some dude away if you have to.

329
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,358
You're not one of them street mutts
who uses people.

330
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,434
You're a good father. All right?

331
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,993
Good husband.

332
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,474
You're a little stressed out today, that's all.

333
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,830
It could happen to anybody.

334
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,996
- What's he doing?
- I don't know, Artie.

335
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,076
Mickey? Where are you, man?

336
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,235
Mickey? Come on, what's the matter?

337
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,635
Talk to me. What you gonna do?
Go out for coffee?

338
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,869
<i>Mick, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm scared for your kids.</i>

339
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,198
It's OK. It's my friends Mr Lewis
and Mr Diroma. Go on, you guys.

340
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,472
He's releasing the kids.
Your man made it happen.

341
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,197
- All right, come in here.
- My mom!

342
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,393
- Where's my mom?
- Everything's gonna be fine.

343
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,513
Mick, these boys want to see their mom.
Why don't you send her down?

344
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,394
- Why don't you get out, Lewis?
- Why don't you cut her loose

345
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,159
and then I'll come down
and we'll talk this shit out?

346
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,590
Why don't you get out of here, Lewis?
I got nothing to say to you.

347
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,712
- He's gonna kill her.
- No, he's gonna give her up.

348
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,876
- He's gonna kill her.
- I want some time with her.

349
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,195
- I can't let him do it.
- Listen to me, Mick.

350
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,118
- I can't let you do it, Mickey!
- Stevie, no!

351
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,908
Go!

352
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,511
Go ahead, move a muscle.

353
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,279
- Move one. I'll pop you right now.
- You got him?

354
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,278
- All right, take him.
- Don't let him move, or shoot him.

355
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,753
- Mickey!
- Come here.

356
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,758
Stevie! Hey, partner.

357
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,792
We're alive, partner?

358
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,154
I'm all for grief support, guys,
but I ain't got all day.

359
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,397
When Artie says so. Not before.

360
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,080
We're gonna run into overtime
because of this.

361
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,469
Danny.

362
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,273
You can't keep him here.

363
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,474
He can't take you where he's going.

364
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,553
Come on. Let these guys do their job.

365
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,472
You all right?

366
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,912
He was tired all the time, you know.

367
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,478
I knew it.

368
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,988
Quinn kept piling cases on us.
Son of a bitch.

369
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,558
He couldn't sleep
with a caseload like we had.

370
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,519
You lay there with names and faces
spinning around in your head.

371
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,157
He had a lot on his mind, you know.

372
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,594
I should have made him go home,
Reet.

373
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,318
I should have put a gun to his head
if I had to.

374
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,556
Even called Quinn.

375
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,750
You couldn't have known, Artie.

376
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,436
Eight years we were together.

377
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,676
Eight years.

378
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,239
- He ain't coming back, is he, Reet?
- I love you, Artie.

379
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,757
I never did this for somebody I know.

380
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,916
Thank God you're here.

381
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,071
Can I have some more tea, please?

382
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,156
Want some sugar?

383
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,989
Hi, Uncle Artie.

384
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,635
Hiya, girls. How you doing?

385
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,838
Hi, Uncle Artie.

386
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,354
Hey, honey. Come here.

387
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,589
Let me talk to you for a minute.

388
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,989
Your daddy had an accident.

389
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,193
Rita!

390
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,270
I want my daddy!

391
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,868
The doctor's number's in the kitchen.

392
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,194
I'll go.

393
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,913
It's OK. It's gonna be OK, I promise.

394
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,313
Where's my daddy?

395
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,510
It's OK.

396
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,555
Marian's an extremely bright girl,
and they suffer the most.

397
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,910
But they also adjust the quickest.

398
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,952
Carol's a baby. As she grows she'll lose
all conscious memory of her parents.

399
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,550
Barbara... of course, needs special care.

400
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,310
She needs two insulin injections a day
and needs her blood tested twice a day.

401
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,670
These pamphlets
will explain how this works.

402
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,712
It's not as bad as it looks.
It'll say about insulin shock...

403
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,912
Excuse me, doctor,
I'm scared stiff of needles.

404
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,600
I hope you don't have a problem
with that, Mr Lewis.

405
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,951
No, I can take a shot.
I don't know if I can give one.

406
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,672
Well, bring the girls in tomorrow
and we'll go over the procedures.

407
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,949
- OK.
- Good night.

408
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,638
Thanks a lot.

409
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,113
So, doctor,
what's going to happen to the girls?

410
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,878
Something good, I hope.

411
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,675
Thank you for coming. I thought
house calls were a thing of the past.

412
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,395
For these girls you go the extra mile.
Good night.

413
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,633
Good night.

414
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,435
You OK? You want something, Barbara?

415
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,755
You have to go to the bathroom?

416
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,832
No? You hungry?

417
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,190
Do you want to eat?

418
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,392
OK.

419
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,149
We have to be quiet.

420
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,396
We don't want to wake up Aunt Rita.

421
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,152
OK. Let's go get some breakfast.

422
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,071
Wait here.

423
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,350
Uncle Artie?

424
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,471
I have to get dressed first.

425
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,119
Yeah. Come on.

426
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,590
Here. Let's go in here.

427
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,514
One, two, three, up!

428
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,356
All right.

429
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,117
What time is it?

430
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,674
I don't know.

431
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,477
Uncle Artie's sleepy.

432
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,115
- Do you always get up this early, hon?
- Always.

433
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,037
Here, take these.

434
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,594
I'm gonna take you to a nice place
for breakfast.

435
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,233
What about my sisters?

436
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,591
Aunt Rita will take care of them
when they get up. Come on.

437
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,433
You OK?

438
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,394
Look, my jobs are up 40%.
I need more personnel.

439
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,591
Don't give me that, Carl.
It's not the same all over the city.

440
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,073
I'm drowning up here.

441
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,589
People on ice killing each other...

442
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,234
Yeah, OK.
Just get me some bodies up here.

443
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,149
- You OK?
- Yeah.

444
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,830
I'm giving you Felix
until we can get a replacement.

445
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,918
Ride him around today.
Show him the ropes.

446
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,476
All right.

447
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,231
Better read this.

448
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,876
Stevie left a will?

449
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,390
Yeah. I took a quick look at it.

450
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,193
He didn't leave much.

451
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,915
Most of the insurance
will go for his wife's medical bills.

452
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,276
He made me legal guardian of his kids.

453
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,719
I saw that.

454
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,155
Wait a minute. What about his family?

455
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,511
- He's got a brother Angelo.
- He's putting it all on you.

456
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,918
You can do what you wanna do.
He won't be around to complain.

457
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,510
Being legal guardians
means you're responsible for the kids.

458
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,837
Lot of paperwork, lot of aggravation.

459
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,229
You gotta see to trust funds
and health plans... schools...

460
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,839
You're gonna want to make sure
they find a good home,

461
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,269
so you gotta stay
on top of the adoption agencies.

462
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,595
You probably want
to check out the parents.

463
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,235
That's all in the future, Cheryl.
What about right now?

464
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,158
Cute as these kids are,
we'll find them a home real soon.

465
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,955
If you could put them up for a week or two,
we'll be making it happen.

466
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,992
We're moving them to my apartment
tonight, but it's small.

467
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,759
You know,
we're crammed in there ourselves.

468
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,754
There's a priest who runs a shelter
at lmmaculate Heart church.

469
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,359
He's a little jammed right now,
but maybe he'll take them in.

470
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,474
We had 27 kids
sleep here last night.

471
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,319
We had to keep the heat, the electric on.

472
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,908
That's gonna kill us
at the end of the month.

473
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,431
Let me ask you something.
Say I bring my partner's kids here.

474
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,073
What might happen to them?

475
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,236
- Three of them, right?
- Right.

476
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,718
Well, we'd move them out
into a baby boarder home pretty quick.

477
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,391
What's that?

478
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,072
It's kind of a... halfway house
for kids waiting for foster placement.

479
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,311
How long might they have to stay there?

480
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,596
That's hard to say.
Especially with three of them.

481
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,314
They may have to be separated.

482
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,749
One of the girls is a diabetic.

483
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,476
This complicates things.

484
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,398
A lot of foster parents
don't want medical problems.

485
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,478
They can be in the system a year or more

486
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,878
before they find a family with the money
and commitment for three little girls.

487
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,797
- And they meet a princess.
- What does the princess look like?

488
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,354
lt'll look... It looked like...

489
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,398
- She had...
- Black.

490
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,069
...black hair.
- Right.

491
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,558
And she had a kind of dress like...
It was pink.

492
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,832
- Pink. That's beautiful.
- And it had blue diamonds all over it.

493
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,757
I was thinking of white diamonds.

494
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,031
White diamonds are pretty.
We'll make it white and blue.

495
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,551
I'm gonna tuck you in.
Let's tuck real tight, real close. OK?

496
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,389
- We'll finish the story later.
- Yeah, we sure will, darling.

497
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,398
OK, here we go. Is that cosy?

498
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,118
- When are we going to Jesus?
- What?

499
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,518
Mrs Christofaro said that Mommy
and Daddy were walking with Jesus.

500
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,596
And we would see them again someday.

501
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,918
Well, you will, sweetheart.
But not for a very long time.

502
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,838
- Not until we die.
- When will we die?

503
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,793
That's not for a very, very long time.

504
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,629
No. We could die at any time,
just like Mommy and Daddy.

505
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,638
- No, you're not gonna die.
- Why? You could die.

506
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,115
Uncle Artie could get shot like my dad.

507
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,198
- That won't happen to Uncle Artie.
- Why not?

508
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,356
Do you think he's a better cop
than my dad?

509
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,278
- No.
- Don't try to cheer us up, OK?

510
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,436
Just leave us alone.

511
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,910
Just let us go to sleep.

512
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,840
OK, guys.

513
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,031
Give me a kiss.

514
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,439
Stop it.

515
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,155
OK, monkeys. Go to sleep.

516
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,590
Oh, God.

517
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,032
It's OK, baby. It's OK.

518
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,832
It's OK. You're all right.

519
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
OK. It's OK, sweetheart.

520
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,029
Honey. It's OK, honey.

521
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,676
Can you put down some towels?
She wet the bed.

522
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,677
- OK.
- OK.

523
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,920
It's OK. You just had a bad dream.

524
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,349
You had a bad dream, honey.

525
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,552
You're safe now. It's OK.

526
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,035
Yeah. You feel better?

527
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,959
I told Dr Gelb
I could give myself the medicine.

528
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,275
But he says I'm still too young.

529
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,509
Well... it's hard for anybody, old or young.

530
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,871
He says he'll teach me when I'm seven.

531
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,594
Let's see. I'm five now.

532
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,712
Five, six, seven.

533
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,070
That's three years to go.

534
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,233
- Don't worry, Uncle Artie.
- I'm not. I'm not worried, hon.

535
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,236
This happens to me every day.

536
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,755
You all right, Lewis?

537
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,233
Yeah.

538
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,594
Take his cuffs off.

539
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,556
I'd like nothing better
than have this mutt make a move on me.

540
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,992
Sit down.

541
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,836
Guess what.

542
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,315
No deals today, Mickey.

543
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,431
No deals.

544
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,154
I just wanna make up for what I did.

545
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,955
Go ahead. I'm listening.

546
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,071
My best friend boxed me into this one.

547
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,313
His name's Clifford Ricks. He lives...
down in the basement at 914117th.

548
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,396
What's Clifford into?

549
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,272
He's recruiting for some new organisation.
Dude they call Beniamino.

550
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,548
Yeah, I know him. Hangs out
at Cienfuegos. What about him? Come on.

551
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,395
He's the ice man. He's the man.

552
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,594
- Don't get comfortable with me, man.
- All right.

553
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,915
You smoking ice yesterday?

554
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,430
Yeah.
Clifford's got a mountain of it in his pad.

555
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,671
- How does Beniamino bring it in?
- He don't bring it. He makes it here.

556
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,554
You just set up a lab.
Wipe out the competition.

557
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,399
Beniamino clipped those four teens
in the project.

558
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,030
Clifford in on that too?

559
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,628
No, man. Clifford ain't no killer.

560
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,675
He's just a get-over guy.
Just like me. That's all.

561
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,553
- Beniamino's the man.
- Where does Beniamino live?

562
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,550
Clifford will tell you.

563
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,955
Clifford's his boy now.

564
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,875
Come on, what else you selling?

565
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,955
That's all I got.

566
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,196
- Don't bullshit me.
- I ain't trying to cop out.

567
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,915
This ice... this shit is the plague.
It's like a hurricane.

568
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,439
Blows you out of this world.

569
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,551
You get so horny
you can tear bitches apart.

570
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,911
You get so angry you could
blow everybody away. You feel so big...

571
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,634
I don't give a fuck how you feel!
I don't care!

572
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,318
- You killed a cop.
- I'm sorry.

573
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,512
- You killed my partner, man.
- I'm sorry.

574
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,077
- You're sorry cos you got caught.
- I'm sorry cos I killed Detective Diroma.

575
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,270
If I could take it back... Jesus!

576
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,676
Get him outta here.

577
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,356
Clifford Ricks here, man?

578
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,469
Chill.

579
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,831
- I can't hear you, man. Yeah or no?
- Down there.

580
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,633
Don't spook this kid, Felix.

581
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,433
I know Clifford from school.
Dude's a lightweight.

582
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,870
He's gonna spill his guts
as soon as he sees us.

583
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,032
I can't believe Clifford's a big ice dealer.

584
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,513
That's what Mickey said.

585
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,395
If he is knocking down all that cash,
he should get himself a new pad.

586
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,671
This place is a shithole, man.

587
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,995
Yeah.

588
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,117
- Urban renewal.
- Yeah.

589
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,800
Maybe you'd better talk to this dude.

590
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,599
Clifford Ricks!

591
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,153
Yo, man.

592
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,238
- Who's that?
- It's Felix. We just want to talk to you.

593
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,032
What the fuck...

594
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,798
- Man!
- What is that?

595
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,512
- Rats, bro.
- Rats?

596
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,552
- Goddammit.
- Fucking dirtbag cops!

597
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,993
Felix!

598
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,190
Shit! Man, I'm all fucked up!

599
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,949
Fuck you!

600
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,833
Come on out!

601
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,199
Come on, motherfucker!

602
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,676
Cover me!

603
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,792
Clifford!

604
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,276
Motherfucker!

605
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,277
I'll bust your head!

606
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,153
- I'm gonna kill you!
- That's it, man. It's over.

607
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,999
- It's over, man. We won.
- I'm gonna kill you!

608
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,078
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, Felix. That's it, man.

609
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,716
That's it. Look at me.
We won it! We're alive!

610
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,559
We are alive, partner.
Look at me. Look at me.

611
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,148
- Say it. We're alive.
- We're alive.

612
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,554
- Say it.
- We're alive.

613
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,908
- Yell it.
- We're alive!

614
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,190
Yeah!

615
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,032
I'm dead.

616
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,676
Is Aunt Rita OK? She left home so early.

617
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,314
She has to take two subways
to get to work.

618
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,115
Maybe I'll call her.
Her work number's by the phone.

619
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,708
It's only for emergencies.

620
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,434
But... I think I'm worried about her.

621
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,199
Better not call. You'll get in big trouble.

622
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,831
Want some coffee, Uncle Artie?

623
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,951
Here. Give me a wind-up.

624
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,798
- Big high kick and a throw.
- Ready?

625
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,399
Babe, I was born ready.

626
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,352
Good catch.

627
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,756
No-one will steal the show
from the bride.

628
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,599
- Mrs Lewis?
- Excuse me.

629
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,077
It's for you.

630
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,716
<i>- Hello.
- Aunt Rita?</i>

631
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,195
<i>- Are you OK?
- Barbara?</i>

632
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,390
<i>Hi, sweetheart. I'm fine.</i>

633
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,715
I love you, Aunt Rita.

634
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,479
<i>- Come home soon.
- I love you too, honey.</i>

635
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,592
<i>- I love you very, very much.
- OK. Bye.</i>

636
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,037
Are you sure it's OK?

637
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,948
Sure. Don't worry. Go.
I'll put the girls to sleep.

638
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,878
- Take this pretty girl out on a date.
- I will.

639
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,638
- Go, go!
- OK. Good night.

640
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,433
Just wanna make sure
you're in there safe and sound.

641
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,831
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

642
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,678
It's busy.

643
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,995
Who could she be talking to?

644
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,554
I don't know.
Maybe we should go back home.

645
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,557
Maybe we should just relax.

646
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,150
This is crazy. We only just got here.
What could have happened?

647
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,628
Everything's fine. Mrs Christofaro's
probably cracking open a bottle of vodka.

648
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,790
Four or five of her boyfriends are over.

649
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,480
- Check, please.
- Come on. They'll be fine.

650
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,071
- George, come here.
- Yes, Artie?

651
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,634
- Bring me a couple more of these.
- You got it.

652
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,958
OK. Let's eat.

653
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,596
- You got a big announcement to make?
- No. Why?

654
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,075
Last time you had two Mai Tais
you proposed.

655
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,668
No, I proposed a weekend in Atlantic City.

656
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,633
I guess I was hoping
you'd make me another proposition.

657
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,239
Like what?

658
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,035
Like we keep the kids.

659
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,555
You want me to sleep in that chair
for the rest of my life?

660
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,477
No. We could get a new place.

661
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,393
Honey, we're fairly tapped, you know.

662
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,351
That means a house.

663
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,754
That's 25 grand minimum.

664
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,111
Lawyers' fees,
closing cost, down payment.

665
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,949
I gotta warn you, it's gonna be
real hard for me when the kids go.

666
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,469
Rita,
we're gonna see these kids all the time.

667
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,070
- We're gonna keep tabs on these guys.
- I'm not talking being Aunt Rita.

668
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,032
Birthday calls
and Christmas and Easter visits.

669
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,470
You know what I'm feeling.
You know what I'm going through.

670
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,955
When we got married, I thought, "Great."

671
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,513
"I get pregnant. Have a kid."

672
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,553
"Another. As many as I want.
Just like my mom and my sisters."

673
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,558
I took it for granted what a miracle it is.

674
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,636
I thought you were pretty much over that.

675
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,471
I was.

676
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,472
I would have been fine
if the kids hadn't come into our lives,

677
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,717
but now the whole thing
just comes up all over again.

678
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,354
I really wanted kids.

679
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,472
It's like I have a second chance.
And I'm gonna lose them again.

680
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,351
- These horses are wild horses!
- Want some cotton candy?

681
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,392
Yeah. Thank you very much.

682
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,431
That was a lot.

683
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,755
Hey, look, there's the dinosaurs.

684
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,836
Let's go watch the clown.

685
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,032
- Hi!
- Girl, can you see from here?

686
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,357
Can I put you down here? How's that?

687
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,633
What's he making?

688
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,990
Would you like a balloon?

689
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,680
Aunt Rita, I want a balloon.

690
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,633
OK, you're gonna get a balloon.
Right after this one.

691
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,353
Uncle Artie's getting nauseous.

692
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,679
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... Swan!

693
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,034
Carol!

694
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,395
Artie, get off!

695
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,953
Get off it! Come here!

696
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,435
- Carol's gone!
- What do you mean, gone?

697
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,552
I don't know.
I just turned around for a second.

698
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,478
- How did you let this happen?
- I don't know! Just find her!

699
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,795
All right. Stay here.

700
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,559
- What happened?
- We were at the dinosaur ride!

701
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,909
I'm looking for a little girl,
pigtails, about four, real cute...

702
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,917
I see so many kids.

703
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,108
- What happened to Carol?
- It's OK, honey. Let's go.

704
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,753
Let's go. I'm sorry.

705
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,037
I'm looking for a little girl...

706
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,234
I know somebody took her! I know it!

707
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,590
Stay here! Marian!

708
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,551
Marian, sweetheart! Wait!

709
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,078
Come here.

710
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,237
Uncle Artie, look what I got.

711
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,435
Where have you been?

712
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,030
Thanks. Where you been all my life?

713
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,993
Baby, you gotta calm down. Listen to me.

714
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,436
I got her!

715
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,632
She was hustling all the balloons
off some guy.

716
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,071
Carol, where were you?

717
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,192
- Thank God!
- I'm sorry I yelled at you, babe.

718
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,796
That's stupid!

719
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,394
What's the matter? Come here.

720
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,999
You have to watch babies.

721
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,429
She could have been kidnapped
and taken away.

722
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,039
But she didn't watch!

723
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,311
We've never had kids before.

724
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,954
This is new to us.
Aunt Rita's trying real hard.

725
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,753
That's OK, Artie.

726
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,678
You're right.
I should have watched more carefully.

727
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,473
But I'm gonna make you a promise
right now.

728
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,636
Look at me, Marian.

729
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,879
I will never, ever take my eyes
off any one of you guys as long as I live.

730
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,514
I'm sorry.

731
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,276
I'm sorry too.

732
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,630
Come here. Come here.

733
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,596
Nice hug. A nice hug.

734
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,112
All right.

735
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:22,679
What do you say we all go eat lunch?

736
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,834
Night, guys. Sleep tight.

737
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,673
- Oh, man.
- Oh, God! What a day!

738
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,112
You know what?
I've been in and out of a lot of scrapes.

739
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,393
But I don't think I've ever been
as scared as I was today.

740
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,795
They're precious, aren't they?

741
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,391
You know what?

742
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,914
You're precious.

743
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,150
Come here, precious.

744
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,315
My darling precious.

745
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,478
Yeah.

746
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,794
- Come here.
- Oh, God.

747
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,551
Sorry.

748
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,113
- Aunt Rita?
- Aunt Rita's not here right now, hon.

749
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,155
I was looking for some shoes
under there.

750
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,919
We forgot to say good night to you.

751
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,918
That's sweet. Give me a smooch.

752
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,759
- Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Artie.

753
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,270
- Give me a hug. Give me a double hug.
- Good night.

754
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,679
- Good night, Uncle Artie.
- See you.

755
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,470
Well, there goes that idea.

756
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,154
"I'm just looking for some shoes!"

757
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,678
You want a beer?

758
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,593
Look at that, man.

759
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,837
Another dude I locked up.
This joint is smoking.

760
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,718
Felix, you reckon that little hump Ricks
was making 80 Gs a month?

761
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,149
lmagine what Beniamino
takes in through that door.

762
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,239
We roll a grenade, we wouldn't have
any more problems with drug sales, right?

763
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,510
OK, here you go, Felix.

764
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,956
That's the slime who killed Stevie,
any way you slice it.

765
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,189
Do me a favour. Call that plate number in.

766
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,512
Good morning.

767
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,917
Nice car.

768
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,395
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yeah.

769
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,913
Your meter's expired.

770
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

771
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,279
- I didn't know. Here, I'll pay it.
- No, no. It's on me. I'll get it.

772
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,156
- There you go, babe.
- Thank you.

773
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,953
I feel so safe knowing I'm so well protected.

774
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,390
Yeah. It's a new service the city provides.

775
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,993
Look at me as your personal policeman,
all right?

776
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,874
From now on, wherever you turn around,
I'll be right there.

777
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,911
That's very thoughtful, friend.

778
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,828
But in a dangerous world,
shouldn't you be where you are needed?

779
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,518
You want to know something?

780
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,637
I'm needed right here.

781
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,149
People in your business
need a lot of protection.

782
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,033
- I'm here to look out for you.
- I have protection.

783
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,754
Boss. We gonna
make an apprehension or what?

784
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,440
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What is your problem?

785
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,028
Babes with big mouths, that's my problem.

786
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,116
You better take care of this dude here.

787
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,357
Artie, you want to bet
that if we toss this guy right now,

788
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,232
we'd find enough stuff
to put him away for life?

789
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:34,148
No, no, no. We can't do that.
That'd be unconstitutional.

790
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,636
We got probable cause.
I think I see a little bulge in his shirt.

791
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,955
That's my money clip, friend.

792
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,913
It wants to go to you.

793
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,269
You don't want it?

794
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,833
Too bad.

795
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,590
We'll leave it for the sweeper.

796
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,876
No, man. It's OK. It's all right.

797
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,151
This is certainly not Fun City.

798
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,159
We'll have to tell our friends
to meet us in Miami Beach instead.

799
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,792
Bye-bye.

800
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,438
Hey, Artie.

801
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:43,072
In Scarsdale they would call this a mansion
and hit you for two million.

802
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,317
Here 140 Gs buys you the keys
and the headaches.

803
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,273
On the top floor we got three bedrooms,

804
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,152
plus the master suite and bath,

805
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,396
where me and my wife used to sleep.

806
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,990
We tried to put as much space
between us and the kids as we could.

807
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,951
You know what I mean?

808
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,310
I'll tell you the truth, Mr Finnerty.

809
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,273
I think I'm wasting your time here, pal.

810
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,431
There's not a bank in the world
that's gonna give me a mortgage.

811
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,189
I don't need no bank
from one of the boys from the old precinct.

812
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,550
We'll make this a cash transaction.

813
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,831
What Uncle Sam don't know
won't hurt him.

814
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,315
You give me 25 big ones in green,

815
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,910
1,500 a month so I can
get my grandkids Christmas presents,

816
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,634
and I'll give you the deed
and I'm outta here.

817
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,194
Case closed.

818
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,230
Everybody says money talks.

819
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,989
To me, money can keep a secret
better than anyone I know.

820
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,510
Let's do one hand. One hand.

821
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,712
Maybe I could get your other sister,
hold her up.

822
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,077
- Hey.
- Hi, Rita.

823
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,196
This is Mrs Frazier from social services.

824
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,595
She'll be looking after the girls for a while.

825
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,355
We weren't expecting you.

826
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,471
Close quarters for all these people.

827
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,238
Yeah.

828
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,591
- Where are the other two?
- They're in the bedroom playing.

829
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,756
- Can I say hello?
- Yeah.

830
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,871
- You wanna take her?
- Yeah, sure.

831
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,833
Hey, Cheryl, let me talk to you for a minute.

832
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,237
What's going on? I didn't know
you'd bring a social worker so soon.

833
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,796
We found three spots for them
together in a nice new facility.

834
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,115
The sooner we get the kids
into the system,

835
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,470
the sooner we can find them a good home.

836
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,750
What the hell is this? A sewer?

837
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,438
I thought I was helping you.

838
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,438
- By slipping them out from under me?
- You can't keep them here.

839
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,312
You can't keep them if Rita's working.

840
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,237
We know all that, all right?

841
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,352
I'm working on getting this big house
up in the Bronx.

842
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,516
Get a house with enough room for kids,

843
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,756
get Rita to take some time off her job,

844
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,075
and you can keep the kids for 30 days

845
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,270
while we investigate foster parents.

846
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,437
You can put in for the programme
once you have the facilities.

847
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,233
OK, fine. We're doing that, OK. That's it.

848
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,272
- Give me seven days.
- We already started paperwork.

849
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,233
- Come on, it's a week!
- The best I can do is a few days.

850
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,669
Artie!

851
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,870
Life ain't easy for orphans.

852
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,878
Yeah.

853
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,109
- Are you taking Barbara to the doctor?
- All three of them.

854
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,519
Barbara has to get her eyes checked
and see a nutritionist for a special diet.

855
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,871
- Yeah?
- And he wants Marian to see a therapist.

856
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,913
He says she needs to be encouraged
to express her grief.

857
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,195
How much are these shrinks getting?

858
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,914
I don't know. Got to be at least 50 a week.

859
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,270
You're getting it back from insurance.

860
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,597
- I don't get any of this stuff back.
- Why not?

861
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,676
They're not related to me.

862
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,237
It's all right. It doesn't matter.
It's money well spent.

863
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,479
We gonna let them take our girls away,
Artie?

864
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,875
What do you mean, "take away"?

865
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,117
How are they gonna take something away
we never even had?

866
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,913
We can't keep those kids
even if we wanted to.

867
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,598
Why?

868
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,790
We don't have enough money.

869
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,151
They don't give kids to people
who can't support them. No room.

870
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,717
No social worker will let three kids
sleep in a bed. They'll lose their job.

871
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,869
Besides...

872
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,915
I hate to say it, but how do we know there's
not somebody who'll do better for them?

873
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,713
- More security, more opportunity...
- More love?

874
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,831
No.

875
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,111
Reet, I'm talking about a back yard.

876
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,471
A bank account, their own bedroom.
Stuff you can touch.

877
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,276
Baby, you gotta let them go.

878
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,078
- It's for their own good.
- No, I know.

879
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,236
I know, Artie.

880
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,712
God...

881
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,594
- I can't do anything.
- Hey, I know.

882
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,349
I know. It's OK. It's OK.

883
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,031
Baby!

884
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,950
Sweetheart, how you doing?
Remember me?

885
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,471
- You giving out parking tickets?
- Not tonight. I want to ask you something.

886
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,071
Your mama know
how you spend your nights?

887
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,112
My mama don't wanna know
as long as the rent gets paid.

888
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,674
- Let me see this.
- That's illegal search.

889
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,429
Get over by the car. Shut up
and get over by the car. Turn around.

890
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,110
Illegal search?

891
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,116
This is an illegal drug.

892
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,989
I could throw your ass in jail,
you know that?

893
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,554
Don't try that. I ain't scared of no cop.

894
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,399
Is that right?
You're scared of Beniamino, though.

895
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,308
What would happen if I told everybody
you were my personal stoolie?

896
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,115
Your boy Beniamino wouldn't like that,
would he?

897
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,913
He'd cut your tongue out
and ask if you were telling the truth.

898
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:01,919
Get in the car. Come here.
Get in the car. That's it.

899
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,397
That's the office, man.
They call it the office.

900
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,398
You go in... and you get the stuff.

901
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,080
You gotta sign a receipt
so they know how much you took.

902
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,758
Then you bring back the money.

903
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,919
- Don't slow down, man.
- Keep your head down.

904
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,878
- Is that where he keeps the money?
- No.

905
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,116
He's got this girl, Grace.

906
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,676
Every night she comes by in the car
and she takes it away.

907
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,155
There she is, man.

908
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,273
Get me outta here. If they catch me
with a cop, they're gonna kill me!

909
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,913
No, no, no, I got it.

910
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,156
I told you everything I know.

911
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,316
Please, cop, get me outta here.

912
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,749
Shut up and keep your head down.

913
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,391
- Let me give you a hand.
- It's OK.

914
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,875
- No. It's heavy. I'll get it.
- It's OK.

915
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,150
Man, that lady is so fine!

916
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,076
Go ahead. Give him some. Go on.

917
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,353
Grace, you want some?

918
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,471
No, you guys can do it.

919
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,637
Somebody let Oreste in. Come on.

920
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,477
Oreste?

921
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,636
Down on the floor right now!
All three of you! Line up!

922
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,149
Now, motherfuckers! Get down there!

923
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,309
You know who you're playing with?

924
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,557
I wouldn't be here
if you were from the post office, asshole.

925
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,278
Here. Tie your boyfriends up with this.

926
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,392
If one of them gets loose,
you're dead, bitch.

927
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,557
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Tie them up right now.

928
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,235
Where's the bread?

929
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,316
- What bread?
- Don't bullshit me, man.

930
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,793
This is no time to show off.

931
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,912
When one of your boys
feels your brains on his face, he'll talk.

932
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,758
Where's the bread?

933
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,190
In the panel. Behind the bar.

934
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,473
All right, show me.

935
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,158
Come on, show me, you motherfucker.

936
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,918
Show me.

937
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,232
All right.

938
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,873
Fill it up.

939
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,551
Come on, come on.

940
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,430
Come on! Fill it!

941
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,356
Put it there. Right there.
Now go back over there.

942
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,635
Come on. Come on.
Let's go, asshole. Get down on the floor.

943
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,239
OK.

944
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,590
Tie your boyfriend up. Come on. Come on.

945
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,109
Come on. Come on.

946
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,238
Take a good look at this.

947
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,157
Take a good look at this, you fuck!

948
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,835
Get down there. Now!

949
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,871
All right.

950
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,474
I see you soon.

951
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,872
- No peeking.
- I'm not peeking.

952
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,029
How long do I have to wait?

953
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,310
Here you go.

954
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,079
- There's a kerb right here.
- OK.

955
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,239
Come on, girls. Here we are.
Let's go. Move it.

956
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,510
OK.

957
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,795
Let's give Aunt Rita a spin. Three times.

958
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,913
One, two, three!

959
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,519
OK.

960
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,149
Surprise!

961
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,831
What's going on, Artie?

962
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,394
I talked Finnerty into taking our note.

963
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,750
Why is he being so nice to us?

964
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,838
Well, cops stick together. You know that.

965
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,391
Also he told me he can't live
another minute there since his wife died.

966
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,830
In truth, I think we're his first real prospect.

967
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,589
What are you cooking up with this guy,
Artie?

968
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,554
Let me ask you something, Rita.

969
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,389
Do you think it's fair
some lowlife dirtbag has millions of dollars

970
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,432
while other people
can't put a roof over their heads?

971
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,949
What have you done, Artie?

972
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,195
Something that can't be undone.

973
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,834
- Be cool, man.
- What you got to tell me?

974
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,072
The thing is
that if we don't find out who it is,

975
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,634
we're just gonna have to do everybody.

976
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,832
- We don't know who it is, man.
- I don't know nothing.

977
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,149
What the hell's he talking about?

978
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,157
Hey, baby!

979
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,236
Where you been?

980
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,992
- Oreste.
- I've been looking for you.

981
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,509
I've been kinda looking for you too.

982
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,552
- I need a little something.
- I got something for you.

983
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,910
I can't go right now. My baby's waiting.

984
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,237
- No, you're my baby. I want to talk to you.
- Look, Oreste, I...

985
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,715
Look what I found.

986
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,719
Raisa.

987
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,239
Beniamino.

988
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,988
Nice to see you. Come in.

989
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,237
I was just telling Oreste
my baby's waiting for me, and I...

990
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,837
You don't have to be afraid.

991
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,032
Have a glass of champagne with me.

992
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,992
Come on.

993
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,236
- This guy ain't no mutt. He was too good.
- Hold it for a second.

994
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,351
Lieutenant Quinn?

995
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,833
Yeah. That's right.

996
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,354
Earl Williams, head of the narcotics
task force, New York state.

997
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,552
Grace De Felice,
one of our undercover operatives.

998
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,274
- Hi.
- Detective.

999
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,072
Why don't you have a seat?

1000
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,949
We got a situation.

1001
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,674
Might involve one of your detectives.

1002
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,234
- Which one?
- Artie Lewis.

1003
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,673
He's one of my best men.

1004
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,753
Well, you're not gonna like this, lieutenant.

1005
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,872
You want to repeat your story,
Detective De Felice?

1006
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,435
I've been working on a guy who's
opening a market for ice in New York.

1007
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,757
I set up the buys, made the phoney sales.
I won his confidence.

1008
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,996
I'll bet you're doing a really good job.

1009
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,636
You got that right. I am.

1010
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,752
I set him up great.
We were getting ready to make a big buy.

1011
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,952
- We would hit every lab on the east coast.
- What happened?

1012
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,755
Some dude comes out of nowhere
last night and holds us up.

1013
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,758
Now my man's crazed.
All he talks about is getting even.

1014
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,678
No business is being done.
The chemist tipped back to Brazil.

1015
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,438
We're gonna blow a year's work.

1016
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,155
I'm sorry to hear that. You didn't
identify the guy that ripped you off?

1017
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,398
- No, he was wearing a mask.
- What does this have to do with Lewis?

1018
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,713
Last week Beniamino threw a bill like this
in a cop's face.

1019
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,992
Last night the dude crumpled this bill
and dropped it right back at him.

1020
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,674
You're losing me.

1021
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,518
It's real simple, lieutenant.

1022
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,712
We went through
your squad's photo ID files.

1023
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,559
The cop last week was Artie Lewis.

1024
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,349
Now you're trying to link him up
with this rip-off? Based on this?

1025
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,109
Come on! You know this crumpled bill
ain't worth anything.

1026
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,913
To nail a cop,
you need something better than that.

1027
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,190
No rip-off artist works alone.

1028
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,799
A mutt would have done us all.

1029
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,388
This dude threw money out the window.

1030
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,317
No mutt would have done that.

1031
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,034
He could have been some wacko.
You didn't see him.

1032
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,912
I hope I'm wrong.

1033
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,474
All I know is that this guy was too good.

1034
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,160
He had to be one of us.

1035
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,593
OK, I got four guys
out on court appearances next week,

1036
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,280
which leaves nobody to watch the store.

1037
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,358
You'll have to talk to the ADAs.
They're slowing us down.

1038
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,552
A court appearance is not a paid holiday.

1039
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,638
You tell your story
then you come back to work.

1040
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,512
OK, that's it.

1041
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,918
You got a pen.

1042
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,796
One more thing.

1043
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,436
Anybody hear about a robbery
at 401 Royalton the other night?

1044
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,479
Somebody hit a drug dealer,
Beniamino Rios.

1045
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,276
We know that dude, don't we, Artie?

1046
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,958
That's funny, him getting hit.

1047
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:24,108
- How do you know this guy?
- His name came up in the Garrett case.

1048
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,390
It's in the report. Just checking it out.

1049
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,317
Did you inform DEA?

1050
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,148
No, I never got around to it.

1051
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,909
It's standard procedure for
major drug dealers. Why didn't you do it?

1052
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,430
- That was the day of the rat attack.
- I don't need a lawyer, thanks.

1053
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,677
I never got around to it.
I know what I'm doing. All right?

1054
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,392
Give me this.

1055
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,829
I'm outta here.

1056
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,798
What's up with that?

1057
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,268
- Are you in the union?
- What's a union?

1058
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,233
- Are you supposed to move?
- Of course I am.

1059
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,350
I wanna show you something too.

1060
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,074
All right. There you are. There you go.

1061
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,708
<i>I need to see you
on Broadway and Third.</i>

1062
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,957
<i>- Are you there?
- You got to do a grand jury on that kid.</i>

1063
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,911
<i>- Broadway and Third.
- OK.</i>

1064
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,634
<i>- Are you gonna be there?
- Get anything on that robbery?</i>

1065
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,318
I'll be there.

1066
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,358
What robbery?

1067
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,236
We gotta talk. I'm scared.

1068
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,672
All right. Get in.

1069
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,356
I haven't heard from him,
but that doesn't mean anything.

1070
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,189
<i>He's probably out working on his own.
I'll try to locate him for you.</i>

1071
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,595
Yeah, OK. Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

1072
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,517
No trouble at all.

1073
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,438
- I'll get back to you.
- OK. Bye.

1074
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,474
That son of a bitch has skipped.

1075
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,988
Hey!

1076
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,353
- Come in. I got a surprise for you.
- Did I win the lottery?

1077
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,277
No, wait.

1078
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,791
What's going on?

1079
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,516
Guess what. I went shopping today.

1080
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,718
Come on. Come see what I got.

1081
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,797
Come on.

1082
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,956
I owe you one, cop.

1083
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,796
Where's the money?
Where's the money?

1084
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,556
You wanna die, cop?

1085
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,114
Where is it? Want some more?

1086
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,514
We have a brave man here.

1087
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,149
You know,
I was a policeman in my country.

1088
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,998
Just like you.

1089
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,830
You don't believe me, do you?

1090
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,472
But I wasn't
a stupid greedy little civil servant.

1091
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,989
No, no, no, no.

1092
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,790
I had a driver.
I had someone to polish my boots.

1093
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,037
That's what a policeman means
in my country.

1094
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,196
And I had respect.

1095
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,636
To steal is one thing, my friend.

1096
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:30,278
But to spit in a man's face by throwing his
hard-earned money out of the window...

1097
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,079
You're wasting your breath, man.

1098
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,471
He's not gonna talk
if he thinks you're gonna kill him anyway.

1099
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,955
He'll talk.

1100
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:57,675
When I put his wife and children
in front of him, he'll talk.

1101
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,713
Or he'll watch them die one by one.

1102
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,478
Our policeman,
he moved his wife and children.

1103
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,468
He's smart. Smart.

1104
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,352
Now he'll never talk.

1105
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,118
Yes.

1106
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,028
Soon life and death won't matter.

1107
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,028
He'll talk.

1108
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,232
He'll talk to stop the pain.

1109
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,871
I'm gonna get some aspirin.

1110
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,398
<i>I don't think
either man's will has cracked yet.</i>

1111
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,312
- I'm on the job.
- What?

1112
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,829
We gotta make a move or they'll cook you.

1113
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,279
You got a gun?

1114
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,834
He's too paranoid about chicks packing.

1115
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,550
They're so whacked,
you might be able to run for it.

1116
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,274
I'm gonna get the front door.

1117
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,754
- Shit!
- Hey! Baby!

1118
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,189
Can I come in?

1119
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,399
You OK?

1120
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,516
You OK in there?

1121
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,153
No, I'm sick. Leave me alone.

1122
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,352
- I'll hold your hand for you.
- No, Oreste.

1123
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,756
<i>He needs to watch out for those shots.</i>

1124
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,950
<i>When Johnson lands a punch, he runs...</i>

1125
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,150
I gotta get my gun.

1126
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,235
- I got it.
- I'm gonna check the front door.

1127
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,078
Wait. That's crazy.

1128
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,589
If you get caught, I'm boxed in here.

1129
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,308
- Listen. We gotta take these guys out.
- There's four of them.

1130
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,954
We gotta take 'em out.

1131
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,073
- Can you get 'em looking the other way?
- Yeah.

1132
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,758
Take this.

1133
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,191
OK, listen to me.

1134
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,753
You go out there.

1135
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,838
I'll take a two count
and I'm right behind you.

1136
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,916
Go ahead.

1137
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,876
Look what this pig did to me!

1138
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,672
He's loose!

1139
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,590
You still alive, policeman?

1140
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,997
Dammit!

1141
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,269
We may have to bluff him out.

1142
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,756
Are you ready for this, policeman?

1143
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,198
Come out!

1144
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,436
Are you ready for this?

1145
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,953
Ready for this?

1146
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,029
Ready for this, you fuck? Come on out!

1147
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,149
Come out!

1148
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,629
- Lewis! Lewis!
- In here!

1149
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,719
Jesus.

1150
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,350
Babe.

1151
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,279
- How you doing?
- Good.

1152
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,469
- How are the kids?
- They're great. How are you?

1153
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:21,398
Got rear-ended by a gypsy cab
on Amsterdam.

1154
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,750
Artie.

1155
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,794
I stole government money.

1156
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,309
You fought for the people that you loved.

1157
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,676
I did the wrong thing.

1158
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,950
I did it for the kids.
Now we can't have them.

1159
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,389
I did it for us and now we're ruined.

1160
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,158
No, we're not.

1161
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,508
We're just beginning.

1162
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,836
I blew it, Reet.

1163
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,988
- I'm gonna win!
- No going on the grass!

1164
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,917
That's not fair.

1165
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,319
- I'll race you upstairs.
- OK.

1166
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,590
I beat you!

1167
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,350
Listen to Mommy.

1168
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,391
I don't want to!

1169
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,273
Too bad. You just better listen.

1170
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,517
What are you doing? You guys fighting?

1171
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,993
- Yeah.
- Why?

1172
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,235
How come? Here. I think
we're gonna have to separate them.

1173
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:42,478
- I think she has to go in the house.
- I think she should go upstairs.

1174
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,034
Uncle Artie? I got something for you.

1175
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,236
Well, I made it.

1176
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,798
It's from when we went to the carnival.

1177
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,751
There's Barbara.

1178
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,359
There's Carol.

1179
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,708
There's me.

1180
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,274
There's Aunt Rita. There's you.

1181
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,392
- You can put it on your desk if you want.
- Yeah, I will.

1182
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,829
You, come here. Give me a hug.

1183
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,111
As a matter of fact,
let's get in one big group hug here.

1184
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,356
Come on.

1185
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,550
A long one. Come on.

1186
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,993
This is gonna have to last me a long time.

1187
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,152
Come in.

1188
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:48,798
You wanna give me your statement
or do you want to write it up yourself?

1189
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,956
Any way you want it.

1190
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,119
I take it, it's a suspect's statement.
You write it yourself, it's a confession.

1191
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,037
It's a confession.

1192
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,240
You can do it out at your desk if you want.

1193
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,152
I'd rather do it here.

1194
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,710
You want the tin?

1195
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,871
Here you go.

1196
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,433
Do me a favour.

1197
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,757
Put that on that cabinet over there.

1198
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,072
That priest brought it in.
Said he'd been staring at it for two days.

1199
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,033
Said it's the worst temptation he ever had.

1200
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:14,118
He knew whoever left the money
fixed it so nobody would find out.

1201
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,000
I should have known
he wasn't gonna keep it.

1202
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:22,193
He says he took out 200 bucks
to take some kids to a museum.

1203
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,153
Says he's gonna take it
out of the collections.

1204
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,396
Why didn't you keep it all?

1205
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:37,188
I just needed enough to buy the house.

1206
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,637
I mean, it's like we always say.

1207
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,796
Everybody's got reasons.

1208
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,672
I ain't making any excuses.

1209
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,758
No, not you. Not Artie Lewis.

1210
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,795
I got heroes and martyrs
all around me here,

1211
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,559
so how come
this neighbourhood's still falling apart?

1212
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,233
That policewoman
refuses to testify against you.

1213
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,032
I almost got her killed.

1214
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:06,709
That don't mean nothing
to the heroes I'm meeting these days.

1215
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,515
Walsh says he's gonna get every cop
to give up a week's pay

1216
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,154
to cover the money you gave to Finnerty.

1217
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,840
The government'll walk away.

1218
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,317
They don't wanna blow their people
in the field with a prosecution.

1219
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,713
Why are you doing this?

1220
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,115
I lost a good man.

1221
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,632
His name was Steve Diroma.

1222
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,715
Detectives like him...

1223
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,869
and you...

1224
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,355
are just too hard to replace.

1225
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,518
So go home, Lewis.

1226
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,951
Go on. Get outta here.
Go home to your kids.

1227
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,274
Hello, Reet.

1228
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,472
We're alive.

1229
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,355
We're alive, partner.
