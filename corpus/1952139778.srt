What movies do you like?

126
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:54,428
Well, probably my favorite movie is:
The sounds of music.

127
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,514
Not because the film itself, but that ...

128
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,977
... with my family every song ever
went well and the stuff.

129
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,563
It is actually a good movie.
Low rating.

130
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,564
Yes

131
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,152

- Yes, those are good.

132
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,738
<i> These are crap .</i>

133
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,284

<i> Thanks.</i>

135
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,495
<i>This  I like .</i>

136
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,039
It is also nice ...

137
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,293
... but there are no people in them.

138
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,838
- Yes, you know, people watch too
pictures where there are none.

139
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,717
<i> - I like this.
- Thanks.</i>

140
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,302
<i> Just at the moment.</i>

141
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,473
So ... What are you doing?

142
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:44,144
I work at Pfizer in the city

143
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,274
You know what? Here are some
pictures with people.

144
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,693
I just have to find them first.

145
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,028
Who is it?

146
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,655
In this photo here ...

147
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,578
That's, uh ... who does that is not there
Where do you ...?

148
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,831
It was my fiancee.

149
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,959
- Your fiancée?
- Yes

150
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,502
Were you committed?

151
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,297
Yes, a couple of years ago.

152
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,133
Is gone, moved.

153
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,345
What happened?

154
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,644
We went for genetic testing for
inherited diseases,

155
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,774
mainly due to children
the future, and both were positive.

156
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,862
She did not wish to adopt ...

157
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,280
... and that's it.

158
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,615
Sorry.

159
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,411
Yes, life of the past ...

160
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,831
<i> Leonard, Sandra, dessert

163
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,012
<i> Actually, no. I have to tell
Truth .</i>

164
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,932
In fact, I wanted to meet you.

165
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,352
Yes?

166
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,855
Yes

167
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,150
I saw you at the store of your parents
and I just ...

168
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,946
... I saw you asking your mother
who will dance with you.

169
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,115
<i>I found it very nice  ...</i>

170
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,369

<i> - You two have a dessert on the table.
- Yes, we heard the first time</i>

172
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,380
Sorry, this is very serious
when serving dessert.

173
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:42,346
Maybe we should go, o. ..
not going to lower the morale.

174
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,430

my grandmother's house.

I live with my dog, Rex.

238

I do not speak dog language ...

240

Yes, this a little sad.

We moved a lot and even
like where we go.

242

360
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,356

He tried to catch your attention.

382
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,303
Caught me.

383
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,304
How are you doing?

384
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,931
Good. What's happening?

385
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:19,932
Going out?

00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:26,748
<i> - Hello.

403
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,293
<i> - Hello, I'm Leonard.

404
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,299
This is a song on my block right?

405
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,759
I will dance at all, I have ...

406
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:41,889
<i>And  goes like this:
Who is going to have fun at this event either</i>

407
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,059
And then say: O N A L R E D

408
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:50,898
So: Who is going to have fun

409
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,524
<i> O N A L E R D</i>

410

L E O N A R D

I can not spell!

413
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,826
What, they want to start?

414
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,703
Because I can impress
with a song.

415
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:05,704
<i>And you can not control  ...</i>

416
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,166
seriously ... it's ... bla ... bla ... bla ...

417
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,459
... Fuck!

418
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,586
<i> That was fifteen years old.</i>

419
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,922
Sorry, but it was cute!

420
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:15,923
Linda?

421
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,759
It is my new best friend.

422
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:20,928
I just said that!

423
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:23,388
¿Michelle?

424
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,557
- Yes?
- Is there something here?

425
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,476
<i> just a friend.</i>

426
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:29,978
<i> Jesus, do not take another</i>

427
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,939
<i> Go! I have to do anything,</i>

428
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,733
<i> living in the middle of nowhere .</i>

429
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,193
So, Leonard!

430
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,694
<i> - Are you much for the club?
- Yes</i>

431
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,656
Think you can, on the track?

432
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,115
We just have to do!

433
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,456
<i> - I think you'll like this, Leonard.
- Yes</i>

434
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,416
¿Dance with me?

435
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,417
Perhaps.

436
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,961
I will make you look bad, you know.

437
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,176
- Hello.
- How you doing?

438
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,262
- This is My Friend Leonard.
- Do you have identification?

439
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:04,263
This joking with you. Come on.

440
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,312
¡Relax, relax!

441
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,213
Are you okay?

442
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,552
- What happened?
- Just come back, Ok.

443
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:49,845
I will be okay.

444
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:57,144
Can you tell me if you want?

445
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,938
You can tell me anything.

446
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,320
Is it because of your father?

447
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:11,742
No.

448
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,453
Why any way?

449
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:17,664
Yes

450
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:26,548
Mira should meet with him today,
but I do not think that amount.

451
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,386
He says he will be with his son.

452
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,140
He is married with one son.

453
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:36,934
Shit!

454
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,810
I'm so stupid!

455
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:40,020
Do not say that.

456
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,731
You are not stupid.

457
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:43,732
- I'm so stupid.
- Do not say that.

458
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,362
Come here.

459
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:54,743
He said he would leave me.
I did it again and again.

460
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:58,622
I do not ever asked him that, and now
I can not think of anything else.

461
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,336
I'm tired of this.

462
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:10,342
These look very stoned now
and very emotional.

463
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,386
You should not think about this, okay?.

464
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,430
Just go home, you get home okay?

465
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,017
You need to calm down. Do not want to be
well with all these people?

466
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,018
Okay.

467
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,731
Do not worry. We're going home.

468
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,276
- Okay. And back.
- Okay.

469
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,821
Wait here.

470
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,656
Shit!

471
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,367
Can I go through my bag?

472
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,326
I was in before.

473
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,162
Leave my bag. Sorry.

474
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,133
Fucking boyfriend, shit!

475
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,612
That is man!

476
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,571
What?

477
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:13,572
I will re-enter.

478
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:14,364
Wait. Are you on the list?

479
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,365
Just inside.

480
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,743
Yes, like all these.

481
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,744
No, just leave.

482
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,205
Stephanie was with ...

483
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,499
Sorry, buddy, if you are not on
list, I can not let go.

484
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:24,833
You have to go.

485
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,712
Are you serious?

486
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,095
Taxi!

487
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,599
Why?. I do not need a taxi.

488
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,869
<i> has a new message .</i>

489
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,915
<i> - Hey Leonard, is Sandra.
- Hi, Sandra.</i>

490
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:09,169
<i> I know we have plans for tomorrow,
but I had completely forgotten ...</i>

491
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:13,006
<i> ... that tomorrow night is the birthday
My dad and I have to go.</i>

492
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:18,303
<i> But Mom says that your parents also
iran, so ... Will you come with them</i>

493
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:23,725
<i> can go after if you want.
Only call me to see if this well.</i>

494
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:28,772
<i> Oh, and certainly not going to believe,
but ...</i>

495
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,357
<i> ... put the music going
on the wire now.</i>

496
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,650
<i> "And I love you"</i>

497
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,860
<i> is excellent.</i>

498
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,737
<i> Okay. Call me. Bye .</i>

499
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,712
<i> Michelle: Are you awake?</i>

500
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:57,384
<i> Hello</i>

501
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:00,304
Hey, you back?

502
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,598
<i> Leonard, you're awake!</i>

503
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,016
<i> Yes</i>

504
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,727
<i> Are you okay?</i>

505
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,770
<i> I see? I can not see you.</i>

506
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:13,650
No, I'm in bed.

507
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:18,530
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry
for what happened.

508
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:22,075
When you return to the club,
I went to the bathroom and fainted.

509
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,537
- What?
- I literally fainted.

510
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:30,876
- If you wait half an hour,
and then I return to the club.

511
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:31,793
Try to call you.

512
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,129
I did not know what to do.
And we left.

513
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,255
Sorry.

514
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:37,841
Everything was crazy.
I'll have to go to a doctor.

515
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:38,842
<i> I do not know what the hell happened.</i>

516
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:39,760
<i>I have a nerve  hell .</i>

517
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:45,599
Yes, that seems really spent
a bad situation with this guy.

518
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,558
<i> is horrible .</i>

519
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,604
<i> is a type of company where I work,</i>

520
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,149
<i> and does this have to pay the rent
of this apartment.</i>

521
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:00,906
His mother lives nearby, so it is
good excuse when it comes here.

522
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:05,035
<i> - Really?
- It is not that bad.</i>

523
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:09,957
<i> really is amazing, brilliant
and can be very pleasant.</i>

524
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:14,878
<i> I think she could use. My friends
never stop to think that his wife .</i>

525
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:15,754
What do you think?

526
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:16,797
<i> do not know.</i>

527
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,259
<i> I do not know. Not like their relationship.</i>

528
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,762
You know what, Leonard ...

529
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:27,307
You should go to dinner with
us tomorrow.

530
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,811
He always says I never
out with friends.

531
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:33,689
<i> So you can come to dinner with us.</i>

532
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,983
<i> And then I can say,
if you think ...</i>

533
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,026

604
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,441
Michelle told me that they are neighbors.

605
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,527
Yes, I live just across the building.

606
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:55,112
Really, so you are.

607
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,701

612
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:07,749
I have many memories there.

613
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,459
So, what do you do?

614
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,671
Working in the company of my father.

615
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,423
Leonard is a photographer.

616
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,175
It is very good.

617
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,176
- Is it true?
- Yes

618
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,218
What kind of photos do?

620
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,597
No. Landscapes.

621
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,849
That's good!

622
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,350
While they enjoy.

623
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,311
As long as you like what you do.

624
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,271
And I think we must
menus,

625
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:30,647
or otherwise arrive late.

626
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,065
They gave me a menu before
but not order ...

627
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:36,737
¿Michelle told you that we have tickets
for the opera tonight?

628
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:37,738
Mmm ...

629
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:41,074
<i>We can not  perdérnosla,
she loves it.</i>

630
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,160
Yes, but you like you too.

631
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:44,161
I am not forcing you.

632
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:45,120
<i> Of course.</i>

633
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:47,039
<i> Of course the love and I know
how much it means to you.</i>

634
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,040
That is true.

635
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:51,793
<i> But you know what great
This, to me ...</i>

636
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,795
... it makes me feel special
when those around.

637
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,049
<i> I'm lucky in having money.</i>

638
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,008
<i> Now I'll tell you something.</i>

639
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,346
<i> When you have someone who
really love ...</i>

640
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:03,847
... took her to the opera.

641
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:07,518
How are you?

642
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:12,022
Yes, take my girlfriend.

643
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,023
Sounds romantic.

644
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,442
What, you have a girlfriend?

645
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,568
Yes

646
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,862
- Leonard, you said you had no girlfriend.
- I did not?

647
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:23,283
Well, we're not together
too long, yet ...

648
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:25,536
This guy has a secret.

649
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,416
I have to go to the toilet.

650
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:33,919
<i>Now  back.</i>

651
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,389
<i> Hey, listen, Leonard ...</i>

652
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:46,390
... come here.

653
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,894
... I want to make me a favor.

654
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:54,398
I want the watch,
I want the monitor.

655
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:55,899
If you can.

656
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:57,901
Are you in trouble?

657
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:01,238
I believe that this drug.

658
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:06,994
If it was not to be saying this, but ...
I can see the signals.

659
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:08,996
I have not noticed anything.

660
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:09,997
Specify ¿?

661
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,126
You know, not from a good family.

662
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:20,257
and his father is mentally ill ...

663
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:22,009
... anyway, do me a favor.

664
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:24,636
Just watch.

665
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:28,056
Only a little, to see that this involved.

666
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,100
I do not play with that.

667
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:33,896
I appreciate that.

668
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,648
Thank you.

669
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:40,986
I see you have a good heart.

670
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:44,907
Yes, really feels like
with my son.

671
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,536
- Hello.
- Hello.

672
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,415
What about talk?

673
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,375
We are talking about how beautiful you are.

674
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:59,463
Specials. I'm hungry.

675
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,777
Well, Leonard ...

676
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,695
... here we take different paths.

677
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,573
- Yes, it was good to meet you.
- Likewise.

678
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,827
Carl, take it to where you want to go.

679
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:32,246
Thank you very much.

680
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,290
- Bye!
- Have fun!

681
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,559
<i>Great moments  Opera .</i>

682
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,229
- Hey!
- Hey!

683
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:40,647
How are you?

684
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,648
Well, well!

685
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,234
Your parents probably do not
are at home, so I thought ...

686
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,028
What do you want me to come?

687
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,155
They are in my dad's birthday.

688
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:50,491
Yes! Yeah, happens.

689
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,495
Would you like something to drink?

690
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,496
Really?

691
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,210
What do you hear?

692
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:02,753
Opera.

693
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,630
- Opera ...
- You like it?

694
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,631
Yes!

695
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,883
I've never been to the opera.

696
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,551
I have been in Nacar.

697
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:10,594
But I was smaller.

698
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:14,223
What do you want? Water ... soda ...

699
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:15,224
Soda, please.

700
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:22,439
She was with some friends in
business meeting.

701
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:23,440
Thank you.

702
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,442
Is this your whole family?

703
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,401
Yes

704
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:30,197
In fact, it was adopted.
I was going to be the king of Denmark.

705
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:35,661
Yes, these are my parents
performing dance movement.

706
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:38,956
My father with a mustache.

707
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:41,250
Yes, and when dad came from Israel.

708
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,754
And that ...

709
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:47,673
That, I am.

710
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:51,468
I'm all dirty.

711
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:55,389
What?

712
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:04,523
Leonard was unsure of the idea
come, it was not ...

713
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:06,108
What?

714
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:07,734
What do you mean?

715
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:10,696
Okay I did not return calls.

716
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:15,492
We do not have to leave.

717
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,620

718
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:21,999

I like you.

721
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:15,802
It's a bit strange that my mother
this us watching.

722
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,243
Should go.

723
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:25,747
Before your parents come
home and see us that way.

724
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:30,169
Could rejoice when
nenes collected.

725
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:45,642
I've heard, you're taking pictures of
my brothers in Mexico, next month.

00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,447
I'll see if I have free time.

731
00:53:58,947 --> 00:53:59,865
Okay.

732
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:04,953

748
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,221
So what do you think?

749
00:55:30,355 --> 00:55:32,649
Leonard, what do you think of Ron?. Dime.

750
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:38,030
I do not know.

751
00:55:39,948 --> 00:55:41,783
Not his way.

752
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:49,166
Do you think it will me, for good?

753
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,212
Seriously.

754
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:57,049
I think not.

755
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:00,010
So ...

756
00:56:10,229 --> 00:56:13,899
Oh, no!, And that this damn business.
And he wants me in this.

757
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,150
I do not know what to do.

758
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:19,446
Michelle, come on, what are you doing?

759

I do not know, I would.

762
00:56:38,215 --> 00:56:40,008
Definitely give everything for you.

763
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:50,727
Leonard, you are good and sweet, but
it would be better not felt well.

764
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:53,981
I do not care.

765
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,316
Leonard, listen to me.

766
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:58,443
You're like a brother to me.

I know that we only know it does
A couple of weeks ...

768

Ronald, I'd like to know.

897
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:17,104
I leave her alone.

898
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:18,897
- Come on.
- Please.

899
01:07:19,523 --> 01:07:21,775
Can you do that for me?

900
01:07:44,256 --> 01:07:45,757
Te quiero mucho.

901
01:07:46,842 --> 01:07:47,843
More than anything else.

902
01:08:05,569 --> 01:08:06,820
That was weird!

903
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:13,952
Leonard, sorry.

904
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:19,875
Well, I call you soon.

905
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:22,044
No, no, Leonard, do not go, please!

906
01:08:23,879 --> 01:08:24,713
Leonard, would you ...

907
01:08:25,923 --> 01:08:27,591
... do something for me, please?

908
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:28,759
Yes

909
01:08:31,845 --> 01:08:36,350
Could you write something on my arm
with your finger to make me sleep?

910
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:39,937
<i> My grandmother did when I was little.</i>

911
01:08:46,944 --> 01:08:48,487
<i> A</i>

912
01:08:48,695 --> 01:08:52,324
<i> AM</i>

913
01:08:55,118 --> 01:08:56,161
<i>AMO</i>

914
01:08:56,245 --> 01:08:58,830
<i> LOVE</i>

915
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,781
<i>Let  funny</i>

916
01:10:14,823 --> 01:10:18,827
<i> You know what? My parents have finally
the photos you took of the Bar Mitzvah.</i>

917
01:10:21,788 --> 01:10:23,540
Do they like the pictures of the dance
at the Bar?

918
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:25,459
- Love it.
- Well!

919
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:27,336
Thanks, honey.

920
01:10:27,711 --> 01:10:29,254
You are welcome.

921
01:10:31,965 --> 01:10:33,717
I got something for you.

922
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:36,637
A gift?

923
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:37,638
Yes

924
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,182
It is winter, cold, y. ..

925
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:42,392
... you have no gloves.

926
01:10:42,434 --> 01:10:43,518
Very nice.

927
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,561
- Yes?
- Yes

928
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:46,480
You like?

929
01:10:46,855 --> 01:10:49,149
Yes, these stitches after ...

930
01:10:50,025 --> 01:10:50,901
Everything is fine.

931
01:10:52,402 --> 01:10:53,320
- Thanks.
- Okay.

932
01:10:57,616 --> 01:10:58,617
You are very sweet.

933
01:10:58,659 --> 01:10:59,576
Thank you.

934
01:10:59,618 --> 01:11:00,619
No big deal.

935
01:11:07,709 --> 01:11:09,336
What happened, are you okay?

936
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:10,295
Yes

937
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,839
I'm just thinking
a friend of mine

938
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:15,008
is going through a difficult period.

939
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:19,888
Well, not to mention the subject again.

940
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,098
No, okay.

941
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:26,311
I like your hands.

942
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,647
They are so soft.

943
01:11:36,822 --> 01:11:39,408
I hate these damn scars!

944
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:43,620
Leonard, I ...

945
01:11:45,414 --> 01:11:47,082
... I want to watch.

946
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:49,793
I think you understand.

947
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:51,879
You're different.

948
01:11:52,129 --> 01:11:54,464
You do not pretend to be someone you're not.

949
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:58,093
Not have to worry about anything.

950
01:11:58,552 --> 01:11:59,970
Or feel embarrassed.

951
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,764
Thank you.

952
01:12:03,348 --> 01:12:07,227
You know, now spend a lot of
things around me,

953
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:14,484
How do I know how I feel right now?

954
01:12:15,527 --> 01:12:17,446
I understand.

955
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:24,244
In a hurry to go somewhere or What?

956
01:12:24,953 --> 01:12:26,663
No, I just want to pay the bill.

957
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,666
Agreed.

958
01:12:31,043 --> 01:12:31,960
Shit!

959
01:12:32,586 --> 01:12:35,047
This must be my father asked:
"How will the appointment?"

960
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:38,800
I address this call.

961
01:12:38,842 --> 01:12:40,010
He is my friend.

962
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:43,388
Sorry, I'll be right back.

963
01:12:48,977 --> 01:12:49,978
¡Michelle!

964
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:50,979
- Hello.
- Hey!

965
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:53,065
I just read your message yesterday.

966
01:12:53,607 --> 01:12:56,818
Yes, I knew that today
was the day.

967
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:58,987
How did it go?

968
01:12:59,029 --> 01:13:01,073
Everything is fine.

969
01:13:01,114 --> 01:13:02,241
The doctor said I'm fine.

970
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:03,200
Good.

971
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:04,576
Because I am worried about you.

972
01:13:04,618 --> 01:13:08,872
No, I'm fine. I am just in bed
and a little lazy.

973
01:13:08,914 --> 01:13:11,166
<i>Listen , Leonard,</i>

974
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:13,710
<i>Ronald  returned from London today.</i>

975
01:13:13,752 --> 01:13:16,171
<i>I decided that after
I will go to his office ...</i>

976
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:18,674
<i> ... and finish.</i>

977
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:19,841
Really?

978
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:21,468
Today?

979
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,469
<i> Yes</i>

980
01:13:22,636 --> 01:13:24,513
<i> thought that what I said,</i>

981
01:13:24,555 --> 01:13:25,514
<i> and you are right.</i>

982
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:27,516
<i> Nothing will change.</i>

983
01:13:28,475 --> 01:13:31,144
It is not fair, what he is doing.
You know?

984
01:13:31,186 --> 01:13:34,523
It is not fair for me and definitely
nor for his family.

985
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:38,235
<i> still wanting to know what
I spend at the hospital.</i>

986
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:41,738
Want to go outside and wait with you?

987
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,740
<i> No, do not worry .</i>

988
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:44,741
<i> I will be strong.</i>

989
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:46,743
<i>Only  Wish me luck.</i>

990
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,120
Good luck.

991
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:49,079
<i> Thanks.</i>

992
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:50,789
<i>I am writing  until after they
everything is finished, okay?</i>

993
01:13:51,164 --> 01:13:52,291
Agreed.

994
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:02,134
I've seen machines like these
over 30 years ...

995
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:03,093
... are obsolete.

996
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,887
We have to get some new ones.

997
01:14:05,929 --> 01:14:08,307
<i> I see that the new Italian menu
machinery, dyer ...</i>

998
01:14:09,766 --> 01:14:10,726
<i>Leonard  ¿</i>

999
01:14:11,143 --> 01:14:12,144
Hi, Dad.

1000
01:14:13,228 --> 01:14:13,979
Leonard.

1001
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:15,439
Hello.

1002
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:17,983
<i> Well, you should probably go.</i>

1003
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,109
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

1004
01:14:20,986 --> 01:14:22,613
Glad to find Leonard.

1005
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:23,655
Listen ...

1006
01:14:24,197 --> 01:14:29,494
Morning. Do you think you could spend
by my office?

1007
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:32,164
There is something I would like to discuss with you.

1008
01:14:33,582 --> 01:14:36,293
Uh ... I work tomorrow.

1009
01:14:36,335 --> 01:14:37,502
No, go with Michael.

1010
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:39,004
Okay.

1011
01:14:39,504 --> 01:14:40,839
Ok, fine.

1012
01:14:40,839 --> 01:14:42,132
See you there.

1013
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:44,301
Reuben.

1014
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,137
You get an excellent bottle of champagne.

1015
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:48,931
Do not you bother.

1016
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:50,641
No, it is a pleasure.

1017
01:14:50,682 --> 01:14:51,642
So yes.

1018
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:52,935
See you.

1019
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:53,936
Yes

1020
01:14:57,856 --> 01:14:58,982
Dad, where's Mom?

1021
01:14:59,024 --> 01:14:59,983
<i> There are no more salsa.</i>

1022
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:01,985
<i> is out. Buying.</i>

1023
01:15:02,027 --> 01:15:06,365
<i> will have another of its famous fiestas
tomorrow night.</i>

1024
01:15:13,288 --> 01:15:14,164
How are you?

1025
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,628
- Have you been good lately?
- I'm fine.

1026
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:22,714
A little anxious.

1027
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:25,008
I'm fine.

1028
01:15:27,302 --> 01:15:30,389
I talked to Michael,

1029
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:35,352
I want to make sure you handle
the investment of all this.

1030
01:15:35,852 --> 01:15:37,104
This is why I do,

1031
01:15:37,145 --> 01:15:38,772
for the future.

1032
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:41,567
And let your health insurance.

1033
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,320
Thank you, Dad.

1034
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:54,871
I'm going to swim in the ocean
Bill Bond Club on Tuesday.

1035
01:15:56,164 --> 01:15:57,541
Be careful, Dad.

1036
01:15:58,083 --> 01:15:59,167
I will.

1037
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:02,337
What?

1038
01:16:02,379 --> 01:16:04,381
Someone has sent you something?

1039
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:08,552
Yes, my friend.

1040
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:11,096
Good.

1041
01:16:11,138 --> 01:16:13,974
I have something to do.

1042
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:15,142
I eat it later, okay.

1043
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:41,168
Hello.

1044
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:43,712
I just received your message.

1045
01:16:43,754 --> 01:16:45,380
I was worried about you.

1046
01:16:45,422 --> 01:16:46,548
Are you okay?

1047
01:16:49,259 --> 01:16:51,094
It was over. I did.

1048
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:56,058
With many screams, but I did.

1049
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:58,810
Sorry.

1050
01:16:59,603 --> 01:17:01,438
I was so fucked up!

1051
01:17:05,192 --> 01:17:07,277
I am totally lost, Leonard.

1052
01:17:10,781 --> 01:17:13,200
I have a friend in San Francisco.

1053
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:16,161
Said to be a while.

1054
01:17:16,203 --> 01:17:16,995
I said I could ...

1055
01:17:19,498 --> 01:17:21,542
a time to stay in your home
while she is not there ...

1056
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:24,545
and felt things.

1057
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:31,093
Do not go.

1058
01:17:38,559 --> 01:17:39,434
I love you.

1059
01:17:43,814 --> 01:17:44,523
Really.

1060
01:17:45,023 --> 01:17:46,108
God.

1061
01:17:49,152 --> 01:17:50,153
Leonard.

1062
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:52,823
You may not want to hear ...

1063
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:54,408
... but it's true.

1064
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:58,203
Leonard, you do not love me. Okay?

1065
01:17:58,245 --> 01:17:59,079
Do not say that.

1066
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:01,415
- I am completely lost.
- Do not say that.

1067
01:18:01,456 --> 01:18:02,374
I am not a kid!

1068
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,668
This is not a stupid mistake!

1069
01:18:06,461 --> 01:18:08,505
Think you do not know what love is?

1070
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,758
As is supposed to marry me!

1071
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:14,136
His parents were the
the talking ...

1072
01:18:14,177 --> 01:18:16,471
... because of a. .. this medical evidence.

1073
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:21,560
And she was.

1074
01:18:26,023 --> 01:18:28,317
I have not been able to find.

1075
01:18:31,778 --> 01:18:33,739
So I tried to hurt ...

1076
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,740
... get in a Hospital.

1077
01:18:35,407 --> 01:18:36,283
I ...

1078
01:18:38,994 --> 01:18:40,203
I do not ...

1079
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:46,335
I thought ...

1080
01:18:47,753 --> 01:18:49,504
... never find love again.

1081
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:56,887
And I love you.

1082
01:18:57,721 --> 01:18:58,764
Really.

1083
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:03,852
Maybe ...

1084
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:08,523
You ...

1085
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:13,153
You think that you do not know
I love you not.

1086
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:14,780
But if you know.

1087
01:19:14,821 --> 01:19:16,323
And I love you even more.

1088
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:18,867
I understand you, Michelle!

1089
01:19:18,992 --> 01:19:21,161
I too am lost!

1090
01:19:27,251 --> 01:19:30,462
I will never move away from you.

1091
01:19:30,587 --> 01:19:31,547
Never.

1092
01:19:33,131 --> 01:19:34,591
He abandoned you.

1093
01:19:35,092 --> 01:19:36,593
I would never do that.

1094
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:39,763
I take care of you.

1095
01:19:41,098 --> 01:19:43,850
This is what you deserve.

1096
01:19:44,268 --> 01:19:46,770
You deserve to be loved.

1097
01:19:52,818 --> 01:19:54,361
And love, too.

1098
01:20:53,337 --> 01:20:54,213
I love you.

1099
01:20:56,715 --> 01:20:57,966
I love you.

You are so beautiful.

1101
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:29,331
You are so beautiful.

1102
01:22:19,256 --> 01:22:20,132
Hello.

1103
01:22:23,594 --> 01:22:25,429
That was beautiful.

1104
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,430
<i> Yes</i>

1105
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:31,393
You know what I just
to account?

1106
01:22:32,769 --> 01:22:34,813
I never seen.

1107
01:22:37,274 --> 01:22:39,151
Me neither, Leonard.

1108
01:22:41,445 --> 01:22:44,865
I feel, really.

1109
01:22:44,907 --> 01:22:45,866
<i> Yes</i>

1110
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:55,751

01:22:55,792 --> 01:22:56,752
Yes

1112
01:23:00,339 --> 01:23:02,257
You are beautiful.

1113
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:12,059
Yes, they are beautiful.

1114
01:23:13,227 --> 01:23:15,354
You're the most beautiful woman
all times.

1115
01:23:24,154 --> 01:23:26,073
What will we do, Leonard?

1116
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:29,993
I can not stay here.

1117
01:23:31,161 --> 01:23:33,497
I can not continue their
support.

1118
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:36,959
<i> I think we really have to go
San Francisco .</i>

1119
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,377
No, I will go with you!

1120
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:40,879
Really?

1121
01:23:41,588 --> 01:23:42,297
<i> Yes</i>

1122
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:45,384
I told Michelle, I love you.

1123
01:23:47,803 --> 01:23:50,097
Would do anything for you.

1124
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:54,643
Do you really love me Leonard?

1125
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:55,894
<i> Yes</i>

1126
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,438
¡Michelle, just go!

1127
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:00,274
Morning.

1128
01:24:03,819 --> 01:24:05,904
Just huyamos!

1129
01:24:05,946 --> 01:24:06,905
Get out of here.

1130
01:24:07,364 --> 01:24:10,075
<i> Yes, the shit!. I have no
reason to be here.</i>

1131
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:13,495
I just want to be with you.
Otherwise I do not care.

1132
01:24:15,372 --> 01:24:16,957
You're crazy.

1133
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:19,751
This is how I say.

1134
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:25,048
<i> I will ensure tickets do not
worry about anything.</i>

1135
01:24:25,048 --> 01:24:26,758
Okay? Called you in a while.

1136
01:24:27,217 --> 01:24:28,176
Okay.

1137
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:30,554

Good night.

1142

Leonard ¡!

1143
01:25:07,549 --> 01:25:09,051
Have you seen the Benny Hill show?

1144
01:25:10,052 --> 01:25:12,387
<i> I just received the new DVD edition.</i>

1145
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:13,388
Yes, it's good, Dad.

1146
01:25:16,433 --> 01:25:17,893
What do you do, Leonard?

1147
01:25:18,685 --> 01:25:20,395
I'm looking on the Internet
A couple of things, Mom.

1148
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:26,735
<i> Gone. com

01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,829
Need Help?

1151
01:25:37,955 --> 01:25:38,789

<i> This is the best we have

1154

I just want to be sure, you know?

1155
01:26:49,151 --> 01:26:50,694
Of all the rings.

1156
01:26:51,737 --> 01:26:53,322
I think it is ...

1157
01:26:53,739 --> 01:26:54,990
... the right choice.

1158
01:27:03,749 --> 01:27:05,500
Yes, it is beautiful.

1159
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:09,588

Will you be using a credit card?

1162
01:27:14,092 --> 01:27:15,052
Cash.

1163

<i> - Now you bring your receipt.

Everything okay with you?

1167
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:27,564
<i>Yes  Everything is good.</i>

1168
01:27:27,564 --> 01:27:30,067
<i> I called my friend in San Francisco.</i>

1169
01:27:30,108 --> 01:27:31,068
<i> I'm excited</i>

1170
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:32,069
Me too.

1171
01:27:32,069 --> 01:27:34,821
Listen, meet me in the zone
rest at eight o'clock, okay?

1172
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:36,990

1173
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:37,991
Eight o'clock.

01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:40,285
<i> Well, definitely be there .</i>

1175
01:27:41,411 --> 01:27:42,538

1176
01:27:42,579 --> 01:27:43,622
<i> I .</i>

1177
01:27:43,622 --> 01:27:45,165
- Oh and one more thing.
- Yes?

1178
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,542
I got a surprise.

1179

<i> I am glad that we came to
This meeting of members, Leonard.</i>

01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:05,686
<i> Just to know the business.</i>

1187
01:28:06,562 --> 01:28:08,397
<i> And how are things going here.</i>

1188
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:12,276
Even children should start
thinking about their futures sometime.

1189
01:28:13,151 --> 01:28:14,653
I do.

1190
01:28:15,195 --> 01:28:16,530
This is your chance.

1191
01:28:16,572 --> 01:28:17,823

<i> My daughter is crazy about you.</i>

1195
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:28,709
<i> And believe me, many guys are
behind her.</i>

1196
01:28:29,293 --> 01:28:32,170
Most importantly, give him what he wants.

1197
01:28:32,212 --> 01:28:34,548
Because she is my life.

1198
01:28:35,549 --> 01:28:37,259
Now I ask you a question.

1199
01:28:38,176 --> 01:28:40,053
<i> And I will be direct with you.</i>

1200
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:41,471
<i> hope you do not bother.</i>

1201
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:46,226
Have you slept?

1202
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:50,522
I think not.

1203
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:54,610
Know why you do this
question, right?

1204
01:28:56,194 --> 01:28:57,821
One is Sandra.

1205
01:28:57,863 --> 01:28:59,448

This is a great thing. Huge.

1208
01:29:04,953 --> 01:29:06,455
To change your life.

1209
01:29:06,538 --> 01:29:07,372
Maybe ...

1210
01:29:07,372 --> 01:29:09,166
This business is important to me.

1211
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:13,170
Your father is a damn good
place there.

1212
01:29:13,837 --> 01:29:15,422

And I know you will.

1218
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,520
I think I know how important
This is for everyone!

1219
01:29:31,438 --> 01:29:32,356
Yes

1220
01:29:34,942 --> 01:29:35,734
Good.

Are you going?

1267
01:32:46,383 --> 01:32:49,553
I saw on the computer that revised
trips last night.

1268
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,391

1271
01:33:10,574 --> 01:33:11,825
Even wearing bag.

1272
01:33:13,368 --> 01:33:15,287
Dispose of garbage.

1273
01:33:18,207 --> 01:33:20,209
You do not have to worry about me.

1274
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:22,920
Be fine.

1275
01:33:35,682 --> 01:33:37,226
I love you so much.

01:33:39,561 --> 01:33:40,604
I know.

1277
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,357
This is your home.

1278
01:33:43,941 --> 01:33:46,026
You can return whenever you want.

1279
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,822
Tell dad that I'm sorry.

1280
01:33:53,534 --> 01:33:54,868
For ruin your investment.

1281
01:33:56,954 --> 01:33:58,413
Now I am happy.

1282
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:00,207
Are you happy?

1283
01:34:00,332 --> 01:34:01,208
Yes

1284
01:34:02,793 --> 01:34:04,670

1286
01:34:07,798 --> 01:34:08,632
Thanks, mom ...

1287
01:34:08,757 --> 01:34:10,551
... but I gotta go.

1288
01:34:49,298 --> 01:34:50,757
Michelle is Leonard.

1289
01:34:50,883 --> 01:34:53,343
I'm down, there are five
minutes to eight.

1290
01:34:53,844 --> 01:34:55,470
Call me for dinner.

1291
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:37,721

1292
01:35:41,975 --> 01:35:43,227
Please ...

1293
01:36:12,965 --> 01:36:14,258
I just call you.

1294
01:36:15,342 --> 01:36:17,135
The car waiting outside.

1295
01:36:21,265 --> 01:36:22,641
I will not go.

1296
01:36:25,644 --> 01:36:27,062
<i> I will not go.</i>

1297
01:36:29,356 --> 01:36:31,275
He left his family for me.

1298
01:36:32,609 --> 01:36:33,944
Deviates from everything else.

1299
01:36:36,154 --> 01:36:37,990
He says he wants to marry.

1300
01:36:39,992 --> 01:36:41,368
I found the route again.

1301
01:36:42,244 --> 01:36:45,038
<i>These things have changed
I think about it.</i>

1302
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:52,254
<i> Leonard, you're an incredible person.</i>

1303
01:36:54,047 --> 01:36:55,549
<i> But he left everything for me.</i>

1304
01:36:55,632 --> 01:36:57,801
<i> I have to give it a chance.</i>

1305
01:36:59,636 --> 01:37:00,554
I feel ...

1306
01:37:01,346 --> 01:37:02,472
I thought it could ...

1307
01:37:06,018 --> 01:37:07,269
Please go.

1308
01:37:09,646 --> 01:37:10,814
Sorry.

1309
01:37:10,898 --> 01:37:11,815
Go!

1310
01:37:13,358 --> 01:37:15,402
I'll pay you the tickets okay?

1311
01:37:17,195 --> 01:37:18,739
Sorry.

1312
01:42:29,132 --> 01:42:30,467
Are you okay?

1313
01:42:32,594 --> 01:42:34,805
What's happening? Where have you been?

1314
01:42:36,974 --> 01:42:38,517
I brought you something.

1315
01:42:39,726 --> 01:42:40,602
Yes?

1316
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:58,370
Oh, my God!

1317
01:43:16,054 --> 01:43:17,389
Are you crying?

1318
01:43:21,602 --> 01:43:23,061
I'm just happy.
