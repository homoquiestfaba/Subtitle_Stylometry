1
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,797
In the last years
of the Cold War,

2
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,359
the former Soviet Union

3
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,463
developed a new weapon
of mass destruction.

4
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,135
Harnessing the awesome power
of Earth's own gravity,

5
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,646
these GD-34 GROWLER bombs
were smaller

6
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,341
and more destructive

7
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:35,376
than any battlefield munition
previously deployed.

8
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,389
In the late 20th century,

9
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,755
the largest repossession company
was GMAC,

10
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,727
General Motors
Acceptance Corporation.

11
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,786
With the deregulation
of the banks,

12
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,560
GMAC and other
less scrupulous companies

13
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,329
were able to sell mortgages

14
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,802
to poor people who couldn't
possibly afford them.

15
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,668
As the economy collapsed,

16
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,834
repossession and corrections
became the United States'

17
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,346
only non-military
growth industries.

18
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:05,146
Meanwhile, six GROWLERS
remained unaccounted for.

19
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,489
Miss Pixxi?

20
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,434
Miss Pixxi!

21
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,911
What's up?

22
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,815
Your forbearers
will see you now.

23
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,647
My what?

24
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,453
Your father, your aunt,
your grandmother.

25
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,856
You know the drill.

26
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,535
Sit down, Pixxita.

27
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,906
Since our last meeting, Pixxi,

28
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,748
you have been arrested
how many times?

29
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,684
Well, it's been 18, hasn't it?

30
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,882
18 times.

31
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,515
Come on, Pops,
you know how it is.

32
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,423
It's those fuckin'
Beverly Hills cops.

33
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,519
They be lyin'
at my probation hearing,

34
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,461
they be lyin' in wait
outside our gate.

35
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,900
Your driving license was revoked
a year ago.

36
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,995
Why are you still driving,
Pixxi?

37
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,835
A girl's gotta eat, right?

38
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,465
I'm entitled to a life.

39
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,634
It's in the Constitution.

40
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,769
Holding up with strangers!

41
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,903
Hookups, Mother.

42
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,572
They call it "hooking up."
Hookups.

43
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,740
That's right.

44
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,751
Oh, Grandma, those are lies.

45
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,719
I knew all five of those boys.

46
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,016
Are we done yet?

47
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,525
Pixxi, we De La Chasses

48
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:30,619
are often accused of being
rapacious oligarchs.

49
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:37,830
Merely on account of our wealth,
we are abused and persecuted.

50
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:44,867
Can you not see how your actions
add to our burden of suffering?

51
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,377
No.

52
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,574
Pixxita, at our last
Family Council,

53
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,485
you swore to abstain from
drinking, driving, clubbing,

54
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,886
eating in restaurants,

55
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,550
lending the De La Chasse
family name

56
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,786
to unguents and perfumes,

57
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:08,767
and having unprotected sex
with boy backup dancers.

58
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,962
And yet, Io and behold,

59
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,097
here we are,
two short weeks later,

60
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,342
and you've done all
of these things, haven't you?

61
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,842
Yeah.

62
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,741
Pops, don't worry.

63
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,110
The cosmetics deal is going
to fall through, but wait!

64
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,043
Wait till you see
my line of thongs.

65
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,516
It's so beautiful.

66
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,075
They're pink and purple
and yellow,

67
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,620
and some of them glow
in the dark.

68
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,019
Cease!

69
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,026
You and your snookery,
your gadabout snookery.

70
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,790
Tell her to get a job,
or she'll be disinherited.

71
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,559
In light of
your continued malfeasance,

72
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,929
we have no choice.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,696
Yes, get a job,
or you'll be disinherited!

74
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,135
Dis-in-what?

75
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,872
Dis... dis-in... what?

76
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,799
"DISINHERITED!!!"

77
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,482
Disin... hurted?

78
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,113
What's it mean?

79
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,886
It's when they go to your grave
and dig you up!

80
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,156
They can't do it to Pixxi
because she's not dead yet!

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,024
- Right, Pix?
- Right.

82
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,659
Coo-ee!

83
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,760
It's me!

84
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,395
Well, then why did you
pick up the phone

85
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,463
if it's a wrong number,
asshole?

86
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,141
You mean disinterred, Eggi.

87
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,840
Disinherited is different.

88
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,177
But what does it mean, Pix?

89
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,917
Disinherited is, like,

90
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,975
when someone owes you
a lot of money, like a fortune,

91
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,180
and they refuse to hand it over.

92
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,549
And what makes it even worse
is that it's your own family

93
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,751
that's trying to screw you over.

94
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,795
That's wack!
That's, like, criminal, Pix.

95
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,921
I know, and that's why
we're going to go

96
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,488
to my office right now
and we're going to get

97
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,091
the best legal advice
that they can afford.

98
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,102
- Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,972
Coo-eee!

100
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,805
Okay, this is the second time
I'm calling you.

101
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,208
Why do you keep
picking up the phone

102
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,605
if it's a wrong number?

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,671
- Asshole!
- Loser!

104
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,511
God!

105
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,575
"RE-ELECT SENATOR
FRANK 'FRITZ' FLETCHER"

106
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,880
"THE BIPARTISAN ALTERNATIVE"

107
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,512
The thing is, Pixxi,

108
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,113
your family don't have to
give you any money

109
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,987
if they don't want to.

110
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,686
Yes, they do.

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,818
No.

112
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,089
No, in fact, the law says...

113
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,495
Who cares about the fucking law?

114
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,796
It's her family.
They can't screw her.

115
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,166
But the law says...

116
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,035
The law can go suck my ass.

117
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,573
Right, Pixxi?

118
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,835
All right, 666, take it easy.

119
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,206
Let's hear what the jerk
has to say,

120
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,710
and then if we don't like it,

121
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,611
we'll just throw him
down the stairs.

122
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,773
Pixxi.

123
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,043
You're an adult.
Yes?

124
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,914
Over 18, 21 presumably?

125
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,749
Don't go there.

126
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,685
The fact is,

127
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,487
your family
has no legal obligation

128
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,822
to give you any money.

129
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,159
Yes, they do!

130
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,527
Let me ask you a question.

131
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,691
Stop asking her questions,

132
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,893
and start suing them!

133
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,731
- Pixxi...
- Yeah!

134
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,896
When your family said
that you were disinherited,

135
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,906
did they offer up
any sort of deal,

136
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,842
a resolution for you
to be un-disinherited?

137
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,649
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

138
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,685
They told me to get a job!

139
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,618
You bastard!

140
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,521
They said if you found a job,
you'd be back into the family

141
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,149
so as to inherit?

142
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,252
Ah!
It's relatively simple.

143
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,626
Get a job.

144
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,130
I have a job!

145
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,964
I am a cosmetics designer
and a fashion designer

146
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,971
and a haute couture model,

147
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,065
and I have my own
record company,

148
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,077
and I'm a media
executive producer!

149
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:45,243
I have so many jobs
that I can't keep count!

150
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,876
Bastard.

151
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,819
You think it's so easy.

152
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,119
But Pixxi is busy.

153
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,921
With her raft of commitments,

154
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,121
ain't no way she'll be able fit
a job into her schedule.

155
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,857
What will she do
when the money runs out?

156
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,263
Hey, Pixxi, look!

157
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,997
These guys are attaching
the front end of your car

158
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,268
to some great big
mobile hook thing.

159
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,809
Savage!

160
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,639
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Frankenfuck!

161
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,179
What the hell
you think you're doing?

162
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,185
Hello.

163
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,583
This here unit,

164
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,630
it's been reassigned
to new owners.

165
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,824
- Huh?
- Yep!

166
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,367
You see, the previous caretakers
of this here lovely unit,

167
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,332
well, they forgot
to take good care of it.

168
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,703
Not only did they neglect
to change the oil

169
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,901
and take it in
for its 50,000-mile service,

170
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,342
worse, they forgot to fulfill
the monthly debt

171
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:51,076
that they had
financially incurred.

172
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,811
Is this
a kind of a money thing?

173
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,853
In a nutshell.

174
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,388
Well, you stay here.

175
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,989
My boss is upstairs.
This is her car.

176
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,959
I'll go get her.
She'll explain everything.

177
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,620
- Okay.
- Great, okay.

178
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,068
You're still
gonna be here, right?

179
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:17,007
I mean, you're not gonna
drive off while I'm inside?

180
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,649
What's it say?

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,883
Well, read it for yourself.

182
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,882
I don't really read too good.

183
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,928
So... can you just tell me
what it says?

184
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,760
- You bet.
- Okay.

185
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:40,924
Right there, it says,

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,365
"General
George Armstrong Custer."

187
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,699
And then, underneath it,
in smaller letters,

188
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,704
it says, "Velvet Glove
Acceptance Corporation."

189
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,763
That's my company.

190
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,206
Well, all right.

191
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,244
That's all right, yeah.

192
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,438
I tell you what...
you stay here, General.

193
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,113
Okay, yes, sir.

194
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,777
Pixxi De La Chasse
will be right down, all right?

195
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,978
Guys, how did they get the
letters to stand up like this?

196
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,480
Huh, Pix?

197
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,444
How did they get the letters
to stand up like this?

198
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,109
On our printer,
we only get it flat.

199
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,380
That's unfabulous!

200
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:41,188
Must be one of those chill, new,
super 3-D printers, I guess.

201
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,784
Add to shopping cart!

202
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,830
Now that's fabulous!

203
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:50,301
"RE-ELECT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
'TWO STRIKES' ESPINOZA"

204
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,338
"Velvet Glove
Acceptance Corporation.

205
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,135
"Hours of opening:
8:00-10:00, 3:30-4:00,

206
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,869
"alternate Thursdays.

207
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,810
"No admittance
without appointment.

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,371
If no answer,
check with bartender."

209
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,887
No answer.

210
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,759
What do we do?

211
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,800
"BEER"

212
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,815
Hey, dildo-head.

213
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,380
We come for our car.

214
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,234
"General Custer?"

215
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,930
I didn't even know we had these.

216
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,939
Did you hear what I said?

217
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,532
I said that we come for our car.

218
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,204
Don't have it.

219
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,270
Give it back.

220
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,250
That car belongs
to Pixxi De La Chasse,

221
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,948
the rock star
and clothing designer.

222
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,114
Still too late.

223
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,817
Thank you.

224
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,086
She's also a record producer

225
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,822
and bigging the media
all the time.

226
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,957
So if you old men
want to avoid a world of hurt,

227
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,366
surrender the motor.

228
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,530
Bank took it away
about an hour ago.

229
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,972
They move fast
on specialty units.

230
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,975
Specialty units,
ain't that the truth?

231
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,977
- They took it away fast.
- Yep.

232
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,843
For the last time.

233
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,084
Beat the bejesus
out of 'em, Eggi!

234
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,485
What?
Me?

235
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,581
If you can't do it,
have one of the boys do it.

236
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,057
Now!

237
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,288
Oh, yeah!

238
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,990
Get up, you deadbeat scum,

239
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,965
and take what's comin' to ya!

240
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:06,164
Okay.

241
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,297
My little pumpkin!

242
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,638
Uncle Aguas!

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,605
It's my uncle, guys!

244
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,884
Interested?

245
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,926
Partially.

246
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,396
Purchasers of locomotive parts

247
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:37,128
are subject to an extensive
background check.

248
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,636
Patriot Act, et cetera.

249
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,242
But you look okay.

250
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,042
Why, thank you.

251
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,979
I am.

252
00:15:53,986 --> 00:16:01,984
So, Aguas, how long
have you been Savage's uncle?

253
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,655
All his life.

254
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,630
So long!

255
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,996
Wow!

256
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,500
That's sick!

257
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,433
Chill!

258
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:16,031
I still don't see how you could
just steal someone's car...

259
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,941
I mean, unit, Mister...

260
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,535
Gray, Ms. Pixxi.

261
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,204
Arizona Gray III can steal

262
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,613
just about any unit
you can conceive of,

263
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,584
so long as the bank desires it.

264
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,383
And not just vehicular units.

265
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,549
The bank owns everything.

266
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:37,152
So Gray goes after boat units,
airplane units, railroad units.

267
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,130
Residential units,
office building units,

268
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,565
medical-dental units,
casino units.

269
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,569
One time, he ripped
an entire factory unit!

270
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,696
Yep, should have seen the look
on those workers' faces

271
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,172
when they showed up
to their jobs

272
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,368
and their plant was gone.

273
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,339
You guys are repo men.

274
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,645
Man, I saw a movie about you.

275
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,708
Shut up, 6.

276
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,310
No, no, look,
there was this dude,

277
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,720
and he was being chased
by repo men,

278
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,418
and then he drove his car
onto the driveway

279
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,256
of this mansion

280
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,228
that belonged to
this old Hollywood movie star,

281
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,025
and then he ended up
drowned in the pool.

282
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,190
Or was that the beginning?

283
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,167
Hey, Uncle Aguas?

284
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,036
That poster says that you're
looking for a few good men.

285
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,097
Yes, always.

286
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,200
A good man is hard to find.

287
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,643
And vice versa, sweetie.

288
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,180
Reason I ask...

289
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,552
That locomotive in the yard.

290
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:44,062
Locomotive unit, yes, mm-hmm,
in our yard?

291
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,428
I would like to buy some parts.

292
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,433
Locomotive unit parts?

293
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,526
That's it.

294
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:55,403
Did Lola run
your security checks?

295
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,635
Mm-hmm.

296
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,370
Assist the gentleman.

297
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,140
Yes, sir.

298
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,182
As I was saying, Uncle Aguas,

299
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,343
my employer,
Pixxi De La Chasse,

300
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,717
is always seeking
chill, real-life,

301
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,120
real-time experiences.

302
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,251
She's not afraid to roll up her
sleeves and get her hands dirty.

303
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,589
She ain't got no sleeves.

304
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,129
You see?

305
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,325
Maybe Pixxi,
because she is so fabulous

306
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,300
and down with the common people,
Uncle Aguas,

307
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,801
might just consent to...

308
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,065
Pixxi could be a repo man!

309
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,231
Yeah!

310
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,434
- An army of one!
- Yes!

311
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,374
- Ripping units!
- Yeah!

312
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,105
Sending deadbeats to the bank!

313
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,548
- Yes!
- Yes!

314
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,585
This would be
the Pixxi De La Chasse

315
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,415
who has nine court appearances
coming up

316
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,218
and is looking at jail time
if she doesn't get a job

317
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,815
in addition to being
disinherited by her family?

318
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,588
That Pixxi?

319
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,095
No comment.

320
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,462
Fuckin' A, that's her.

321
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,398
Get off!

322
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,766
How much you gonna pay me
to hire her?

323
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,878
So how much
are they paying you?

324
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,548
Don't really know.

325
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,450
Money goes directly
to the company.

326
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,650
I just do what Aguas says,
and Aguas says,

327
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,659
drive her around,
show her the ropes.

328
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,490
Sounds interesting.

329
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,393
So where are they?

330
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,658
Where are what?

331
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,359
The ropes.

332
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,333
In the trunk,
along with the spare tire

333
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,668
and some confiscated
personal items and checklists.

334
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,868
Are your friends
gonna do this all day?

335
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,706
Yeah, actually they're making

336
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,679
a documentary reality show
about me.

337
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,272
No kidding!

338
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,577
When's it going to be on the TV?

339
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,551
Not any TV you have.

340
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,179
It's going to be
on a very exclusive, in-house,

341
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,519
hotel intranet in Dubai.

342
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,786
That's better than any TV show.

343
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,557
Sorry!

344
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,688
All right.

345
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,494
There's your first assignment.

346
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,899
You see that big old trailer
at the end of the street?

347
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,166
We need to liberate that
from some Freddie Mac offenders.

348
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,174
These are some mainline
mortgage-abusers.

349
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,334
All right.

350
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,708
Let me at 'em.

351
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,796
You have 30 seconds
to vacate this property.

352
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,807
After that,
I will begin shooting!

353
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,570
Twenty-five.

354
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:50,274
Excuse me.
I mean 10, 9...

355
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,829
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

356
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,033
Pixxi De La Chasse interview.

357
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,608
Take one.

358
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,613
What's up, Pix?

359
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,741
So what was it like,
your first day on the job?

360
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,409
That's a very good question.

361
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,713
Wait, wait.

362
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,981
Sorry.

363
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,647
Action!

364
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,284
Take two!

365
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,922
So what was it like,
your first day on the job?

366
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:20,600
Well, you know, at first,
I kind of felt bad, you know?

367
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,733
Having to get up real early
and dress way down

368
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,902
just to... to fit in.

369
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,878
But once I started
doing the work,

370
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,882
I realized that I, too,
could make a difference.

371
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,510
It's like my friend
the Dalai Lama said,

372
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,486
"When he returned
to his own city,

373
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,888
he saw no throne."

374
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,425
Wow.

375
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:45,589
Pixxi, you know everything.

376
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,529
Wow, yeah.

377
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,365
Pretty much everything
worth knowing.

378
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:56,772
Oh, Aguas, Aguas,
you should have seen her, man.

379
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,503
This girl's a natural.

380
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,035
It was one of the finest
opera primi I have ever seen.

381
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,581
She shoot the dogs?

382
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,048
No, but she sure scared 'em!

383
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,780
And when she did
that countdown...

384
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:17,728
10, 9, 8, 3, 2, 6, 4...
it was a classic.

385
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:18,922
And the unit?

386
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,089
Already subdivided.

387
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,996
Three new families moved in.

388
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,591
Nice people.

389
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,364
Spoke to 'em a while
in their own lingo.

390
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,564
You want to take her out again?

391
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,732
Sure.

392
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,539
Let's see...
sailboat.

393
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,705
Sailboat.

394
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:40,150
Last seen Marina del Rey.

395
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,013
Three corporate jets, Ontario.

396
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,784
Back to Detroit, deadbeats!

397
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,849
And take the bus.

398
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,986
Impressive.

399
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,757
The problem...

400
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,923
Problem?

401
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,728
She's too good.

402
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,893
- Hmm?
- Yep.

403
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,629
Look at her stats.

404
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,864
Since yesterday,
she has ripped five cars...

405
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,099
- Fantastic!
- Four homes...

406
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,801
- Terrific!
- Three planes...

407
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,537
six shopping malls,

408
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,169
and two places of worship.

409
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,644
You're saying
that if she continues thus,

410
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,947
her work will be the standard
by which ours is judged.

411
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,954
Exactly.

412
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,991
We got us a live one, Aguas,
filled with boundless energy,

413
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,992
ambitious, sadistic,

414
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,655
fast.

415
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,666
Better add sand
to that gas tank.

416
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,133
Check.

417
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,068
666, I'd like these rushes
fine-cut by tonight.

418
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,571
Eggi, I'd like you to get
my lawyer

419
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,197
on the phone yesterday.

420
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,875
I'd also like a print-out of how
my thongs are doing marketwise.

421
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,937
And, Savage, shiatsu now!

422
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,884
What it do?

423
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,058
He got beat up, Pix.

424
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,822
My bodyguard?

425
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,625
There were eight of 'em, Pixxi.

426
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,861
Why'd they beat him up?

427
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,060
Drug dealers.

428
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,763
Drug dealers!

429
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,740
666 owes a lot of money
to drug dealers, Pixxi.

430
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,743
- A lot of money.
- Drug dealers, huh?

431
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,176
Have they got
any good Quaaludes,

432
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,771
any Roar 714,
knock you on the floor?

433
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,579
No, just the real thing.

434
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:24,679
Coke, crank, The Way.

435
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,724
So how much are they charging
for a gram of coke?

436
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,849
Less than forty?

437
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,554
No, Pixxi, seventy-five.

438
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,891
What?

439
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,557
No one's that stupid.

440
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,864
Are you guys lying to me?

441
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,733
No, Pixxi!

442
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,863
They beat him brutally.

443
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,067
They said they'd kill me.

444
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,201
Unless he pays them
what he owes.

445
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,746
And how much does he owe?

446
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,577
A million dollars.

447
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,515
Are you kidding me?

448
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,018
You're trying to tell me

449
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,611
that you consumed
$1 million worth of drugs?

450
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,782
$500 worth of drugs
would have killed you.

451
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,621
Why are you still alive,
you idiot?

452
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,754
Are you guys trying to lie to me
and steal all my money?

453
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,821
No, Pixxi.

454
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,527
Pixxi, new assignment.

455
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,537
Check!

456
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,732
Yard 2 is where
all the Secondary Units

457
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,707
are tracked and stored.

458
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,676
Secondary Units?

459
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,178
Up till now, you've just been
handling the Primary Units:

460
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,272
Cars and homes and such.

461
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,217
Secondary Units is where all
the big, important stuff is.

462
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,981
Consider this your promotion.

463
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,689
Hello, Lola.

464
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,854
New recruit.

465
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,627
Pixxi, meet Lola.

466
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,772
Won't last.

467
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,283
We'll see about that.

468
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,185
So how much
are they paying you?

469
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:08,021
To entertain you, Pinkie?

470
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,118
Not enough.

471
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:14,291
Go fetch me some dregs
from that slop bin over there.

472
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,699
Lola, not that I'm not having
a fabulous time with you,

473
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,997
but I'm just wondering,
you know,

474
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,666
when the actual fun
is going to begin.

475
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,905
This is the fun.

476
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,343
No, no, no, it's not.

477
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,108
The fun is when
we were ripping units,

478
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,615
and I was going
into people's homes, and I...

479
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,912
That's Primary Units.

480
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,680
Secondary Units
are way too heavy,

481
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,383
and by the time they get to us,
they're already wrecked.

482
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,023
How about that?

483
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,357
Forget it, Pinkie.

484
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,765
Doesn't exist.

485
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,235
Says here it do, shorty.

486
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,101
Three antique railroad cars.

487
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:03,638
Dining, Caboose, Observation...
$1 Million Reward.

488
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:07,014
1-900-LOST-TRAIN.

489
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,713
Can I have your phone?

490
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:16,887
That antique railroad car
is an urban myth.

491
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,158
You know, like the poodle
in the microwave

492
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,428
or the hippies spitting
on the Vietnam vets.

493
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,136
Why did they put a poodle
in a microwave?

494
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,138
Was it wet?

495
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,901
They never did.

496
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:35,913
It's a myth, like these
antique railroad cars,

497
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,413
or the big lottery win.

498
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,246
Existing solely to encourage

499
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,048
typical, no-hoper jerk-offs
like you.

500
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,713
That's where you're wrong,

501
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,450
'cause I am no typical,
no-hoper jerk-off.

502
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,022
I happen to come from one of

503
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,958
L.A.'s nine
most influential families,

504
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,928
and if it weren't
for some bullshit scandal,

505
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,829
then my father would be mayor.

506
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,165
Take these dregs
back to the slop bin.

507
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,302
Check!

508
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,813
Father.

509
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,484
It is I, Pixxita.

510
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,890
Pixxi, is it you?

511
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,454
Last time you were here,

512
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:32,162
you consigned me, your aunt,
and grandmother

513
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,070
to the torments of hell.

514
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,041
You vowed never to return.

515
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,205
Yes, I know, but I think that
we can put that in the past now.

516
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,080
Can't we all just get along?

517
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:51,851
Pixxi, the De La Chasse family
escutcheon hangs in the balance.

518
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,914
Have you found
gainful employ yet?

519
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,892
Yes, I have found it!

520
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,428
I am a repossession woman.

521
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,828
You and the Beverly Hills
court system were right

522
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,230
to force me to get a job.

523
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,394
I've learned so much
from my experiences,

524
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,497
especially here,
in this beautiful family chapel.

525
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:13,442
Yes, lovely, isn't it?

526
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,342
So having earned my lesson,

527
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,938
I'd like to take an advance
on my inheritance

528
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,075
as to promote
a few business ventures

529
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,245
as well as pay off a few fines.

530
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,315
Ten million would be best,
but five is acceptable.

531
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,090
Cet argent n'existe plus.

532
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:37,328
It was so thoughtful and kind
of you and grandma and my aunts

533
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,337
to cut me off temporarily.

534
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,929
I...

535
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,837
I really think it just turned me
right around,

536
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:48,504
like as if I took a cold shower
in the bright of day.

537
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,572
What did you say before?

538
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,846
I said, Pixxi,
that money is no more.

539
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,549
Your entire inheritance,

540
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,321
all $77 million of it,
give or take,

541
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,852
has been given
to Mother Teresa's Daughters,

542
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,296
which is a marvelous
little charity

543
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,993
that provides women of poverty

544
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,367
access to false information
regarding pregnancy

545
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:19,934
and denies access
to birth control.

546
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:24,607
Wow.
That's quite something.

547
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,544
Your grandmother thought
it would piss you off.

548
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,984
Oh, how it did.

549
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,544
And I'm just going
to have to get you back.

550
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:36,322
You just try, my darling.
You just try.

551
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:42,993
We De La Chasses are white,
rich, relatively vice-free.

552
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,002
We have no debts,
huge holdings.

553
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:51,133
And so, my little chickadee,
you can't touch us.

554
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,980
You just wait, homes.

555
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,385
So, Lola.

556
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,148
Yes, Pinkie?

557
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,350
Is it true with just
a few strokes of the keyboard,

558
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,622
someone could ruin someone's
credit score, get them evicted,

559
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,458
kicking and screaming,
from their own home,

560
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,122
even if they own it,

561
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,326
or is that just another one
of your urban myths?

562
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:22,271
No, Pinkie.
That is no myth.

563
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,171
And there are those of us
in our business

564
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:28,941
who have done that very thing,
so as to revenge ourselves.

565
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,952
These are such lovely flowers
that you have here.

566
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,318
Really beautiful.

567
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,482
They're Gray's.

568
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,617
Lola, could you show me what
keystrokes and mouse clicks

569
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,628
are required to do such a thing?

570
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,459
To do what, Pinkie?

571
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,056
Oh, I don't know,
ruin someone's credit,

572
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,259
destroy them completely?

573
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:54,567
As a joke, obviously.

574
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,938
Sure, Pinkie, I'd be happy to.

575
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,704
Give me a name at random.

576
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,072
Aldrich De La Chasse!

577
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,239
Spell it.

578
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:10,584
A-L-D-R-I-C-H.

579
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,284
"DE LA CHASSE FAMILY RUINED;
ALLEGED FORTUNE DOES NOT EXIST."

580
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,637
It's impossible.

581
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,305
Can't be done.

582
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,474
Doesn't exist.

583
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,141
But I saw it.

584
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,619
I saw the entire train,
three cars and a locomotive.

585
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,623
Do you know how many repo men
and women

586
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,716
have wasted good
man- and women-hours

587
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,057
in the fruitless search
for that imaginary unit?

588
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,619
Couple of them never came back,

589
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,995
and the ones that did,
well, they were never the same.

590
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,397
That's because
they were searching

591
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,729
for something
that doesn't exist.

592
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,133
A ghost train.

593
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,693
This is not a ghost train.

594
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,138
It is made of real flesh
and blood, like me...

595
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,108
and it's worth
a million dollars!

596
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,542
Have you called
that 900 number?

597
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,409
The one that's offering
the million dollars?

598
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,742
I don't have the train yet.

599
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,783
Well, why don't you
call them now

600
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,485
and see if the offer
still exists?

601
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,080
I'll call them,
after I rip that train, Lola.

602
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,056
Hey.

603
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,161
Make a charitable contribution?

604
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,761
What's the charity?

605
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,171
Against golf.

606
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,435
I don't play golf.

607
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,737
Nor do I.

608
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,507
We're gonna get it made illegal.

609
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,105
Do you know how many lives
are ruined by golf courses?

610
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,811
Nope, but I can imagine.

611
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,255
Only got a buck on me.

612
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,781
That's fine.

613
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,693
Thank you.

614
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,254
Who was that, Gray?

615
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,165
Man taking up a collection
to ban golf.

616
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,634
- No kidding!
- Yep.

617
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,694
I've never been golfing.

618
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,070
Me neither.

619
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,109
You want to give it a whirl?

620
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,575
Sure, boss,
on my next day off...

621
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,544
Okay, stop changing
the subject!

622
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:20,243
Aguas, assign me that train.

623
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,785
All right.

624
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:26,119
That unit that doesn't exist,
the ghost train,

625
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,388
you're assigned to find it.

626
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,793
Thanks!

627
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,355
This is after you do
your real work, kiddo.

628
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,367
We have a date tomorrow
to smash up

629
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,461
a pallet-Ioad
of mercury vapor lamps.

630
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,268
Check!

631
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:50,269
Oh, Marco.

632
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,478
I just had
the most amazing dream.

633
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,110
I was...

634
00:35:56,187 --> 00:36:00,521
I was busting up a pallet
of mercury vapor lamps,

635
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,151
and all of a sudden,
I could fly!

636
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,354
And as I was soaring
to great heights,

637
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,455
I looked down,
and I saw my grandma

638
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:13,129
and my aunt
and my father, and...

639
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,607
they were being beaten
by the police!

640
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,438
Watch some telly, boo-boo.

641
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,410
You'll soon forget it.

642
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,844
Right.

643
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,652
Oh, snap, look, Pixxi!

644
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,311
It's me in my new video!

645
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,916
There was a monkey
that escaped from the zoo...

646
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,594
Police swoop on downtown's
homeless tonight.

647
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,223
For the sixth night
in succession,

648
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,927
LAPD are seizing
the propertyless

649
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,501
and dumping them
beyond the city limits.

650
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,632
Swine flu
at the National Kennel Club.

651
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,868
Are these pups affected?

652
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,810
Look how cute the puppies are!

653
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,575
And did you see
that neat old train

654
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,513
under the bridge
where them cops were?

655
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,950
No, tell me about it...

656
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,745
Two classic passenger cars,

657
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,622
a caboose,
and a black locomotive.

658
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,493
What?

659
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,860
That's it!

660
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,592
That's the train.
That's my train!

661
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,899
1-900... what was the rest
of the number?

662
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,670
The rest of what, Pixxi?

663
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,270
The number for the train
that we found!

664
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,214
1-900-LOST-TRAIN?

665
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,614
Very funny.

666
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:39,452
1-900...

667
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,990
Hello.

668
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:46,822
Hello.
I found your train.

669
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,421
- Are you there?
- Uh-huh.

670
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,399
I found your train, okay?

671
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,368
Okay.
Where is it?

672
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,468
Wouldn't I be the silly one
to tell you

673
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,303
where your precious little
train is?

674
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,312
Not until I see the million
buckeroonies, buckaroo!

675
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,746
I see your current location
as Santa Fe Avenue

676
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,909
and the 7th Street Bridge
in the City of Vernon.

677
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,816
Do you still have
the unit in sight?

678
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,354
Fuck you!

679
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,855
Give me my money first,
or else I'II...

680
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,857
Stop that, Pixxi,
I can't be driving like that...

681
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,533
Eggi, give me your phone!

682
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,701
Can't...
I'm trapped...

683
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,007
Now!

684
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,637
Okay...

685
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,682
Come on!

686
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,478
Where Pixxi?

687
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,853
Senator Fletcher, well!

688
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,830
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, sir.

689
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,596
I'm Nevada, on behalf
of GrandioseSolutions. Com.

690
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,364
And this is Giggli.

691
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,497
If there's anything you
should need during your trip,

692
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,873
and I do mean anything, Senator,
just call on either one of us.

693
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,607
Well, I might just do that.

694
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,807
Senator!

695
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,873
Mr. Lorenzo.

696
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,441
Welcome aboard, sir.

697
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,680
Thank you.

698
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,724
Pixxi, boo-boo!

699
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,420
You've reached the Velvet Glove
Acceptance Company.

700
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,555
We're out right now,
screwing some unfortunate.

701
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,727
If you seek to be screwed by us
as well, wait your turn.

702
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,999
Aguas, listen...
I found the train!

703
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,103
Supreme Court Justice Espinoza
and Mrs. Espinoza!

704
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,074
I'm Nevada,
from GrandioseSolutions. Com.

705
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,580
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

706
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,115
- Of course.
- And this is Giggli.

707
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,612
Welcome aboard!

708
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,951
Ladies, thank you.
There you go, honey.

709
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,717
Reverend Duncan!

710
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,419
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

711
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,962
You can call me Sister Duncan.

712
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,724
And what's your name, love?

713
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,894
I'm Nevada, Sister,
from GrandioseSolutions. Com.

714
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,699
On board, Giggli will give you
your welcome pack.

715
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,433
Brother Lorenzo?

716
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,134
Welcome aboard, sir.

717
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,373
Brother Lorenzo.

718
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,412
Sister Duncan!

719
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,609
Brother Lorenzo.

720
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,981
Watch your step.

721
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,849
Oh, a mysterious envelope!

722
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,081
Surely you don't think
that I...

723
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,783
No, no, no.

724
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,984
Just a small gift from
our sponsors, Sister Duncan.

725
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,527
For your work with children.

726
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,529
Oh!

727
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,531
- Please.
- Thank you.

728
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,794
Welcome aboard!

729
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,977
Damn it, Marco,
Which one's mine?

730
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,815
Look, Pixxi, red carpet!

731
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,616
Hey!
Coo-ee!

732
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,781
May I help you?

733
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,849
Yes, by getting out of my way.

734
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,952
This train has been hired
for a private excursion.

735
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,930
Yes, I know.
I'm on the guest list.

736
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,829
Your name?

737
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,030
Pixxi de la Chasse
Obando y Bravo, of course.

738
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,834
Well...
you're not on the list.

739
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,467
Hmm.
Looks like I am!

740
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,874
"Rikki Espinoza"...

741
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,709
that's my pseudonym
for all the parties.

742
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,646
Nevada,
this is Pixxi de la Chasse.

743
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,911
She is in all the tabloids.

744
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,148
Her family are, like, you know.

745
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,917
- Really?
- Yes.

746
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,585
And this excursion
would barely exist without me.

747
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,958
Well, please.

748
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,156
The rest of the guests are
having a pre-brunch cocktail

749
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,529
in the Observation Car...

750
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,862
You're not on the list.

751
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,663
If you'd like to join them,
Pixxi...

752
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,226
Oh, that's so sweet,
and what's your name?

753
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,132
My name is Giggli.

754
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,969
Giggli, what a lovely name!

755
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,736
Isn't it?
My parents made it up.

756
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,610
Very sweet.
Coo-ee!

757
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,478
He's with me.

758
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,236
Miss Pixxi,
and Mr. Marco, is it?

759
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,900
Welcome aboard.

760
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,537
I'm Lorenzo,
your on-board service manager.

761
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,046
May I fill your glass?

762
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:35,916
Please...

763
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,886
And we're off!

764
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,515
GrandioseSolutions. Com
is proud to organize

765
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,684
this brief tour
of the proposed route

766
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,751
of the Arbogast Energy Corridor

767
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,730
for VIPs, stakeholders,
and opinion-formers.

768
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,630
For the next few hours,

769
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,829
as Grandiose Solutions' Luxor
Parlor Train visits these sites,

770
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,305
we'll be serving brunch,
followed by lunch,

771
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:03,571
a wine-tasting, and English
country-house-style sandwiches.

772
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,239
May we refill your glasses?

773
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,717
Sure.

774
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,254
I'll get back to you.

775
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,914
What am I doing here, again?

776
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,015
Visiting the proposed route
for the Energy Corridor,

777
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,957
Senator Fletcher.

778
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,996
A half a mile wide,
a thousand miles long,

779
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,793
serving the L.A. Area

780
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,732
with liquid natural gas
from Coos Bay, Oregon,

781
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,963
wind power from Canada,

782
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,938
and heavy crude from
the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge.

783
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,975
Well, that's great.

784
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,977
Only maybe I should have brought
my hard hat.

785
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,243
It will not be necessary
to leave the train, Senator.

786
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,344
We are just interested
in your general impressions.

787
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,921
You can view
the proposed Energy Corridor

788
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,120
from the comfort of your seat
in the Observation,

789
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,288
Dining Car, or Caboose.

790
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,663
Not the Caboose, Giggli!

791
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,998
Right!
Not the Caboose...

792
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,799
Why not the Caboose?

793
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,807
Only maybe I should have brought
my hard hat!

794
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,934
These people are total fools.

795
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,171
Who cares about them?

796
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,008
How much money did he give you?

797
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,608
I don't know.
I haven't checked yet.

798
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,813
Gimme.

799
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,040
Ms. Espinoza?

800
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,013
We're going to have
some cocktails

801
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,209
in the Observation Car.

802
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,019
Wasn't it Billy Graham?

803
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:58,721
No, I believe it was
Pat Robertson who said

804
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:04,257
that it was unrealistic
and naive to be preoccupied

805
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,393
with civil liberties
and disarmament,

806
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,097
as some of our politicians are.

807
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,800
At a time when
Western civilization

808
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,933
is confronted by the extremist
of threats.

809
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,102
Yes!

810
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,373
My sentiments also.

811
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,848
I'll have another little splash
of this.

812
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:25,048
I see you like to go around
with a pink plastic bullwhip.

813
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,353
P.P.B. S are the new A.C.D.s.

814
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,952
We are ready to begin serving
brunch now in the Dining Car,

815
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,758
one car down.

816
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,093
Between meals, you are welcome

817
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,928
to come hang out here
in the Vista Dome,

818
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,868
but do me a favor, folks,
do not try and use the Caboose

819
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,168
on the far side
of the Dining Car.

820
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,768
The Caboose remains closed
as of this time.

821
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,712
Brunch!

822
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,785
Morning, Cap.

823
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,723
Whoa, excuse me there.

824
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,191
What a beautiful morning!

825
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,231
It certainly is.

826
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:12,928
It's the kind of morning
which tempts one

827
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,334
not to go inside that door.

828
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,928
Ignore the messages.

829
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,839
Pay no attention to the emails.

830
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,740
And go fishing.

831
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,083
Sherry from Manzanillo, Spain,

832
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,085
a dry, refined taste

833
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,747
to accompany
the spectacular desert vistas

834
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,019
we'll soon be enjoying.

835
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,962
"El Monte.

836
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,335
"Heading east.

837
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:52,068
Follow me."

838
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,302
I got the same text.

839
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,971
Me too.
Wonder who it's from?

840
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,139
Pixxi's assistant.

841
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,513
Mr. Lorenzo,

842
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,548
this trip in this
magnificent antique train,

843
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,126
all this fine food, et cetera,

844
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:17,395
it's costing somebody
a few extra bucks, I'd say.

845
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,867
Our clients
are very interested in your

846
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,962
and the other dignitaries'
support, Senator.

847
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,529
Really.

848
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:28,237
Yeah, but what do any of us know
about pipelines, damn it?

849
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:35,582
There may be other issues
you can help us with.

850
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:40,051
You're a smart man, Lorenzo.

851
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,250
I'm open for business any time.

852
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,453
Senator.

853
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,423
Pixxi checks out.

854
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,392
Society heiress on day release
from county jail.

855
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,259
Father owned most of the Valley.

856
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,266
He recently went bankrupt in
some mysterious circumstances.

857
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,632
What about the white rasta guy?

858
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:31,307
Backup singer, dancer, grandson
of some Eurotrash royalty.

859
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,173
Any value
as a U.S. Opinion-former?

860
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,609
Negatory.

861
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,587
Thirty-nine angry messages.

862
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,322
First angry message.

863
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,125
Hello, Mr. Gray?

864
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,131
I'm really sorry
to bother you again,

865
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,565
but you're the only person
I can think of who can help.

866
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,330
You remember the furniture

867
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,429
we were storing in our car
after you repoed our house?

868
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,337
Well, they just took
our car away,

869
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,501
and I was wondering if there's
any way you could find out

870
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,134
who got our car
so I can go there

871
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,236
and get our furniture back?

872
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,043
The other guy said you all
burned that stuff

873
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,946
when you had a feast there
in the Yard,

874
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,646
but I said that didn't sound
like you or like Mr. Aguas.

875
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,121
Anyway, hope you're having
a great day.

876
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,624
Thanks again
for the fifty dollars.

877
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:27,494
Grandma really appreciated it,
and my number is...

878
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:32,131
Lord, for what we are about
to receive,

879
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,432
for what we have
already received,

880
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:39,567
and the wisdom to know
the difference, thank you.

881
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,508
- Amen.
- Amen.

882
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,603
Mr. Lorenzo,
when can we expect to see

883
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,614
this Energy Corridor of yours?

884
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,377
I mean, here we are
out in the desert and...

885
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,716
Ah, the Arbogast Corridor,
of course.

886
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,151
You know, in the excitement,
I forgot to mention it.

887
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:58,251
Mr. Lorenzo, people worry
about the silliest things.

888
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,728
Aren't your sponsors concerned
about the NIMBY factor?

889
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,693
No.
The law is the law.

890
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:06,293
Those greens can quickly
be put to other uses.

891
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,133
Greens?

892
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,106
Is this political?

893
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,608
May as well tell 'em.

894
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,542
What?

895
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,172
Okay.

896
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:23,117
There is another reason
we invited you here...

897
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,380
Yes, Mr. Lorenzo?

898
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:27,287
And what would that be?

899
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:31,259
The criminalization...

900
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,023
of golf.

901
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,324
Golf?

902
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,629
Golf.

903
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,365
The guys who took my car,
Mr. Custer,

904
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:46,705
evidently didn't know there was
a box of kittens in the back...

905
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,267
I'm on the train.

906
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,007
And the sommelier is babbling
about golf!

907
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,776
Call me back
on Eggi's phone ASAP.

908
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,449
Aguas, Gray, Lola, what's up?

909
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,577
Where did you go?
Fishing or something?

910
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,321
Aguas!

911
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,791
Lola!

912
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,758
"GONE GOLFIN"'

913
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,605
Golf courses
are a waste of precious

914
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,507
agricultural and public land.

915
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,137
They squander billions
of gallons of water annually,

916
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,080
while spreading innumerable
poisons and insecticides

917
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,810
into the environment.

918
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,609
I enjoy a good game of golf.

919
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:33,645
Me too.
Two strikes.

920
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,782
In the Third World,

921
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:40,296
golf courses mean death
to small indigenous communities.

922
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:46,632
I know that as rational citizens
and opinion-formers

923
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,228
that you will join with me
in the urgent call

924
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:53,606
to have golf made illegal,
both at home and abroad.

925
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:58,637
Larry, boy,
you're kidding, right?

926
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:03,084
Scripture is explicit
in its advocation of golf.

927
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:07,112
Revelations 6:13.

928
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,622
Yo, Gray!

929
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,322
Where the dickens have you been?

930
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,330
Okay, you're on the train,

931
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,332
and it's headed back
to the Union Station.

932
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,492
Got that.
I'll be there.

933
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,729
What time's it due?

934
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,371
Pixxi?

935
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,569
Pixxi!

936
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,478
Hello?

937
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:34,142
Sit down, backup dancer!

938
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,185
Ladies and gentlemen,

939
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,654
since you have declined to join
our righteous cause,

940
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,157
I will be obliged to detain you.

941
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,715
This will only be
for a couple of hours.

942
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,523
Then you will be at liberty,
if all goes well.

943
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,223
Cuff them, Giggli.

944
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,822
This is terrorism!

945
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,460
If you believe that to seek
much-needed political change

946
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,868
by radical means is terrorism,

947
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,566
then our nation
is a terror state.

948
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,666
- Nonsense.
- Can it, "Two Strikes."

949
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,735
Now, each one of you
has contributed in some way

950
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,474
to the pernicious spread
of golf.

951
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,244
You, Senator Fletcher,

952
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,909
have frequently sought
to be photographed

953
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:14,317
with golfing celebrities like
Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods.

954
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,849
I... I... had to.
There was no alternative.

955
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,761
You, Pastor Duncan,
married 2,000 Korean golfers

956
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:24,732
in an on-course mass ceremony
in Puchong.

957
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,860
I don't recall.

958
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,735
And you,
Justice and Rikki Espinoza,

959
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,637
built a complex
of vacation homes

960
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,938
at the golf resort of Boracay,

961
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,270
with an 18-hole course

962
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:40,180
that requires 800,000 gallons
of water a day

963
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,741
on an island that has no water!

964
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,384
Hey, you don't need
to handcuff me.

965
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,892
- I hate golf.
- You're just saying that.

966
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,895
- No, I'm not.
- Wait.

967
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,828
She and her friends gave me
a contribution

968
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,390
when I was downtown
collecting for the cause.

969
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,901
That's right.

970
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,200
I despise golf so much
that when I was in high school,

971
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,365
I used to get really high,
go to the golf courses,

972
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,375
and throw lighters
and matches on it

973
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,876
just to set it on fire.

974
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,572
Don't trust her, Lorenzo.
She's lying.

975
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,205
Am not!

976
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,715
Okay, fine.

977
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,249
Show 'em, Marco.

978
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,878
Yeah, mon!

979
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:28,455
What is M.H.G.C.I.?

980
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,592
Malibu High Golf Course
Incendiaries.

981
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,812
Hello.

982
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:53,720
Found your train.

983
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,553
Okay.
Where is it?

984
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,855
It's en route to a station
in the Southland.

985
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,828
I claim my million dollars.

986
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:04,333
I see your current location
as Wall Avenue and 112th Street

987
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,460
in the city of Commerce.

988
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,902
Do you still have the train
in sight?

989
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,304
Did I misspeak?

990
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:12,807
Apologies, sir.

991
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,969
Those million dollars,
how about 'em?

992
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,876
Now, see here, Mr. Custer,

993
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,608
this is
a national security matter,

994
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,583
and you're obliged to tell us
all you know

995
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,881
about that unit right now!

996
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:31,727
Why don't you kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

997
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:43,001
Two calls from this vector
in the last 48 minutes...

998
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,507
the unit must be
in this vicinity!

999
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,626
Are you ready, Lorenzo?

1000
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:16,434
Five, four, three, two, one,

1001
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,736
and going live.

1002
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:28,915
Do not attempt to adjust
your television set.

1003
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,886
We have taken control
of all networks.

1004
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:35,857
We have disabled
all remote controls.

1005
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,416
We instruct the president
of the United States

1006
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:42,431
to close all golf courses

1007
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:46,026
and ban the corrupting practice
of golf.

1008
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:49,538
We further instruct
that he and his colleagues

1009
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:53,406
cease eating meat immediately.

1010
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,740
If the president fails
to do this,

1011
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,906
within the next hour,

1012
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:04,750
the city of Los Angeles
will entirely be destroyed.

1013
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,584
So there!

1014
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,420
I told you not to switch
the channels.

1015
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:13,724
Right now we are aboard a train
which, traveling at top speed,

1016
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:19,963
will arrive at the Union Station
in L.A. At 1900 hours.

1017
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:25,531
We'd like to play a round
or two, my friend.

1018
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:30,841
Sign us up as temporary members.

1019
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:31,972
I can't do that.

1020
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,845
Come on, don't be a jerk.

1021
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,909
All we want to do
is hit some balls around.

1022
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,851
The club is closed today,

1023
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,891
and we're not accepting
temporary members.

1024
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,653
- Racist.
- Sexist.

1025
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,524
That really hurts me, guys.

1026
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:50,157
You haven't got a clue
as to what's going on here.

1027
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:56,832
If any attempt is made to stop
this train, we'll do the same.

1028
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,840
Okay, wrap it up.

1029
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,173
You missed out on
a whole bunch of stuff

1030
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,742
about the founding fathers
and the freedom fighters!

1031
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,185
Nevada saved your ass.

1032
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,553
I couldn't concentrate.
The Growler bombs...

1033
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,854
Growler bombs?

1034
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,826
You can't be serious.

1035
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:19,953
These things take time!

1036
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,896
Screw the long run, Senator!

1037
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,799
This will get resolved today!

1038
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,928
Why are we broadcasting
out of the Caboose?

1039
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,665
It's hotter than hell.

1040
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,173
When you guys are done arguing,
can I ask a question?

1041
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,870
We are not arguing!

1042
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,138
Don't ask them questions, Perky.

1043
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:37,907
- You're provoking them.
- Am not.

1044
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,609
Yes, you are.
Stop it.

1045
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,015
Fuck you, Rikki.

1046
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:47,113
So, Mr. Lorenzo,
you were only bluffing

1047
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:52,924
about blowing up
this train, right?

1048
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,103
You're certain they have
Growlers on board, Professor?

1049
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,834
As many as half a dozen.

1050
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,208
CIA assured us all those
Growlers were accounted for.

1051
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,076
Except the ones in Mexico,

1052
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:14,674
which we now know are secreted
on that train.

1053
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,720
We've run want ads
for this missing train

1054
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,051
in all the repo media,

1055
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,114
made up old-style
"Wanted" posters

1056
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,989
offering
a million dollars reward.

1057
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,258
You got the reward money
authorized, right?

1058
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,162
Well?

1059
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,259
Uh, you didn't, did you?

1060
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,930
We're taking those crazies out.

1061
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,768
Predator drone, sir?

1062
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,569
Hello?

1063
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:43,976
Hey, this is the guy who just
gave the ultimatum on TV.

1064
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,675
You were watching, right?

1065
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,580
Go ahead.

1066
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,018
Well, I just wanted to say
that you're probably thinking,

1067
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,649
take out the train now
with a predator drone, right?

1068
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,784
Well, do not try it.

1069
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,693
Our Growlers are primed
and ready to detonate

1070
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,096
in the event of any attempt
to stop us.

1071
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,830
And in addition, we have
five august dignitaries here

1072
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,600
as guarantors of our security.

1073
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,573
They are:

1074
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,839
Supreme Court Justice
Fabio Espinoza.

1075
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,311
Rikki Espinoza,

1076
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,146
Emeritus Director
of Minority Rights Watch.

1077
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,584
Sister Duncan, Universal Church
of Life, City of Toil.

1078
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,315
Thank you!

1079
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,155
State Senator Fritz Fletcher,
and I'd like to add my own...

1080
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,291
Holla, I'm Pixxi.

1081
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,800
Say your name properly.

1082
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,700
Pixxi De La Chasse
Obando y Bravo,

1083
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,137
composer and performance artist.

1084
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,368
And I be Marco.

1085
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,907
You now know we are serious.

1086
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:53,108
You have thirty minutes left.

1087
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,047
Should we advise the president?

1088
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,779
President is in Mongolia
right now

1089
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,879
attending a meeting of
non-aligned ethanol producers.

1090
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,287
He'll be asleep, for sure.

1091
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,949
The vice president?

1092
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,323
Also in Mongolia.

1093
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,952
Neither of 'em's gonna ban golf.

1094
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,894
Not in an election year.

1095
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,762
The Reaper Drone it is, then.

1096
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,323
Fishing, I understand.

1097
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:18,807
It's relaxing,
and sometimes you get a fish.

1098
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,400
But this?

1099
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,669
If this is what
the upper echelons of society

1100
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:24,940
do to enjoy themselves,

1101
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:28,780
then the crisis
is worse than I thought.

1102
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,423
Marco, you batty-man!
Marco!

1103
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,826
Boo-boo, shut up!

1104
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,129
No, I'm not gonna shut up!

1105
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,794
How dare this asshole
not include me

1106
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,735
in his list
of celebrity hostages?

1107
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,036
My godfather is Prince!
Prince!

1108
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,303
I'm, like, the second-biggest
celebrity here!

1109
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,106
Are not!

1110
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,342
Marco, you batty-man!
Marco!

1111
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,939
Hi.

1112
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,077
Your goal,
and tell me if I'm wrong,

1113
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:08,954
is to abolish
the golf courses, right?

1114
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,822
Yes!

1115
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,795
And to get the president and all
his crew up there to go vegan.

1116
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,298
You seriously expect
our president

1117
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,960
to become a vegetarian?

1118
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,298
Vegan.

1119
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,703
Yeah, and what do you call them,
his, uh, his...

1120
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,366
His staff?

1121
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,376
His cabinets!

1122
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,208
This is about climate change,
too, you see.

1123
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,339
I see.

1124
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,857
Not my glasses!

1125
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,122
Marco, Marco!
Stop the train!

1126
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:48,424
I can do that, Pixxi!

1127
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,125
My black sheep uncle, Giancarlo,

1128
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,292
used to be engineer
on the Paris-Milano Express!

1129
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,460
Many times, as a little boy...

1130
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,935
Baby, baby, baby!
Hurry!

1131
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,370
Check!

1132
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,907
Marco!

1133
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,373
Marco is the hottest boy
in the world,

1134
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,417
and I am the hottest girl
in the world.

1135
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,357
Coo-ee!

1136
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,060
Marco!
Give us a smile!

1137
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,230
This is Pixxi.

1138
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,103
So, anyway.

1139
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,836
Hello, Savage.

1140
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:41,980
Beautiful, baby!

1141
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,042
Eggi ordered one of those
3-D printers you like,

1142
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,213
and it's coming on Tuesday!

1143
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,381
Why didn't she overnight it?

1144
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,253
I don't know, Pix.

1145
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,417
Wait.

1146
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,790
This is Pixxi.

1147
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,829
Allo, Pixxi, love!

1148
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,261
There is no engineer!

1149
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,323
Somebody be runnin' this train
remotely.

1150
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,564
Maybe the Caboose!

1151
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,136
You guys!
Just get with it!

1152
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,340
Shall we gather at the river,

1153
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:54,014
the beautiful,
the beautiful river,

1154
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:58,993
gather with the saints
at the river

1155
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:05,591
that flows
by the throne of God?

1156
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:18,413
Sir, it may not be necessary
to deploy the predator drone.

1157
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:22,076
"It may not be necessary
to blah, blah, blah."

1158
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:23,641
Well, too bad for you,

1159
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,253
because we're gonna deploy
the predator drone!

1160
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:30,019
And maybe even
the Reaper Drone too!

1161
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:34,085
I mean, what are you,
some kind of Communist?

1162
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:37,155
Yes, sir, as it happens,
I am a Communist.

1163
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,498
But I do not see how that's
germane to this discussion.

1164
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:46,303
You better leave this experiment
immediately, you commie bastard.

1165
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,277
Colonel!

1166
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:54,282
For the record, sir,
I, too, am a Communist.

1167
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,476
What?

1168
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:56,643
So am I, sir.

1169
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,914
So are others here present.

1170
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,387
We've come a long way, Colonel,

1171
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,186
from the days when Communists
were witch-hunted

1172
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:07,025
or denied a role in the military
or homeland security.

1173
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:08,358
We Communists just believe

1174
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,456
in a different
political system, sir,

1175
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,524
and in a more just society,

1176
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:15,161
whose cornerstone
is a safe and reliable

1177
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:17,535
public transportation network.

1178
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:21,167
Plus free
universal health care.

1179
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,940
Okay, Commies.
Shoot!

1180
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:28,415
Colonel, right now,
this train is passing through

1181
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,976
the busiest rail transportation
corridor in the West.

1182
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,646
Even one Growler blast

1183
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:37,022
will put the entire system
out of operation indefinitely.

1184
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,551
Then comes the firestorm!

1185
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:49,228
Hello?

1186
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:53,036
They spoke to the president.
Uh-huh.

1187
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,100
Okay.

1188
01:06:55,177 --> 01:07:00,672
No, no, that's not negotiable.

1189
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,151
Okay, yeah.

1190
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:07,189
I'm just saying.

1191
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,089
Well, you tell him!

1192
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,031
The president said...
okay, get this.

1193
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,762
He said he's very open
to banning golf

1194
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,529
and that he personally is happy
to go vegetarian immediately.

1195
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,040
- Wait!
- No!

1196
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,302
But he can't speak
for the Senate

1197
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,536
or the House of Representatives.

1198
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,737
Wait!
No!

1199
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,279
No!
But... no.

1200
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,541
No way.

1201
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,741
Well, that's what I said, okay.

1202
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,307
I said,
it has to be all of them.

1203
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:40,253
And he said he'll get
the word out right away.

1204
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,688
And is he going
to call you back?

1205
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,225
I guess so.

1206
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:48,161
Who were you talking to?

1207
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,720
I don't know!

1208
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,029
Now stop asking me questions,
Lorenzo!

1209
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,398
You're freaking me out!

1210
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,334
- Do you want my hankie?
- What?

1211
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,496
Do you want my hankie?

1212
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,437
Is everything okay?

1213
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:02,375
Sure.
Yeah.

1214
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,537
What's wrong?

1215
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,740
Nothing's wrong.

1216
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:10,547
I knew it would go like this!

1217
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:15,784
We agreed to insist
the president go totally vegan.

1218
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,759
And it already got watered down.

1219
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:24,789
Vegetarian and vegan
aren't the same!

1220
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,597
Solidarity, Giggli!

1221
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:31,572
We're dealing in the art
of the practical here.

1222
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,575
Do you want my hankie?

1223
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:38,340
Thank you!

1224
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,383
Hello?

1225
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,781
Okay.

1226
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,720
Okay.

1227
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,619
Okay.

1228
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,630
I don't know about that.

1229
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,828
What time?

1230
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,870
Let me get back to you.

1231
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:15,373
The president has agreed
to everything.

1232
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,614
Enabling legislation to ban golf

1233
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:21,155
will be passed
by midnight tonight.

1234
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,215
That's 9:00 p.m. Our time.

1235
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,726
All meat products will be pulled

1236
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,786
from the Capitol Hill kitchens
by that hour.

1237
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,265
I'll tell the Doc.

1238
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,215
- Hello.
- Hello?

1239
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,580
Anybody there?

1240
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:49,845
Who is this?

1241
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,477
Those terrorists
you were talking to,

1242
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,146
they may not be able
to stop this train

1243
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,850
because the locomotive
hasn't got a driver!

1244
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,257
Listen, I need you
to immediately deploy a huge,

1245
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,423
gigantic, airbag-type-thing
between us and downtown!

1246
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,489
Is this
an official communication

1247
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:05,727
from the terrorists?

1248
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,861
No, you idiot.
It's Pixxi!

1249
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,803
Just do what I say!

1250
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,568
- Pixxi.
- Hello?

1251
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,939
Neither Amtrak
nor Union Pacific possesses

1252
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,544
such a huge airbag technology
that you suggest.

1253
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,673
I mean, maybe we should,
but we don't.

1254
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,343
However, Pixxi,
there is still a chance.

1255
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,353
Right now, the pirates
are following the route

1256
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,355
of the Sunset Limited.

1257
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,288
All lights and points are set
in their favor

1258
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,950
all the way to downtown.

1259
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,888
But if you could switch
the points

1260
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,453
onto the old
Mojave-Lancaster spur,

1261
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:36,964
L.A. Can be saved!

1262
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,757
That's a real chill notion,

1263
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,631
but how would you like me
to switch the points

1264
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,228
if I'm on the train?

1265
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,705
It's for you.

1266
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,940
Thank you.

1267
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,312
It's Pixxi.

1268
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,941
Arizona Gray.

1269
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,542
Backing you up
at the Union Station.

1270
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,712
Everything okay?

1271
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,755
No, Gray, it's too late.

1272
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,586
It's never too late, Pixxi.

1273
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,558
No matter how large
or complex the unit,

1274
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:05,924
no matter how long the odds,

1275
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,327
if there's a price,
we can collect it!

1276
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,262
Not in this instance.

1277
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,823
Pixxi, you must succeed.

1278
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,893
The example that you're setting
to us all by doing so

1279
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,632
is critical.

1280
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:20,732
If you fail, mortgage defaults
will continue to rise,

1281
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:22,709
forcing more repossessions,

1282
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,770
driving home prices down,
causing more defaults.

1283
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:28,408
Bailouts will cease to save us.

1284
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,008
Bankers will stop making loans.

1285
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,811
Businesses will fail,
leading to rising unemployment,

1286
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,379
zero credit,
a worldwide recession,

1287
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:40,451
and, thus,
the end of the repo trade.

1288
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,690
Okay, well, Gray,
if we're to achieve this,

1289
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,926
you have less than three minutes
to get to Glendale,

1290
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,592
throw the switch from downtown

1291
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,330
to the old
Lancaster-Mojave line.

1292
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,803
Three minutes?
From the Union Station?

1293
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:50,998
That's impossible!

1294
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,007
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1295
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:56,841
Well, just do it anyway.

1296
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,470
Check.

1297
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,955
And that's what
the president said.

1298
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,000
Doc, we're laughing.

1299
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,059
In future years,
instead of golf courses,

1300
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:26,969
there'll be farms, allotments,
parks named after us.

1301
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:31,706
You spoke to the president?

1302
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,372
No, no, it was all done
via this guy.

1303
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:34,643
You spoke to him too, right?

1304
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,582
Yeah, a military guy.

1305
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,950
He was on the level.

1306
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,672
Drat!

1307
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,447
May I ask who's calling?

1308
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,074
Yo.

1309
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,709
Gray?

1310
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,549
Miss Pixxi?

1311
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:14,384
Yeah, this be she.
Who's this?

1312
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:19,052
Miss Pixxi, this is Rogers,
your father's manservant.

1313
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:22,063
Rogers.
What's up?

1314
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:26,465
Miss Pixxi,
what an opportune surprise.

1315
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:31,029
I'm afraid your friend has
suffered an attack of some kind,

1316
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:33,574
laying him low.

1317
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:36,839
Gray?
Shit!

1318
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,746
It appears he was
just about to pull this lever

1319
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:44,445
when his incapacitating stroke
occurred.

1320
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,385
Are you trackside?

1321
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,548
Are you near that lever?

1322
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,422
I am adjacent to it.

1323
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:52,858
Rogers, I need you
to pull that lever.

1324
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,156
Pull the lever!

1325
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,763
Miss Pixxi, I would love
to be of service,

1326
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,633
but my first duty
is to your family.

1327
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:09,439
Is there no way that you,
your father, and your aunt

1328
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:12,036
cannot be reconciled?

1329
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,411
No.
No way!

1330
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,450
Tell them to go to hell!

1331
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:16,575
I'm not talking to them.

1332
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:23,554
Then I cannot assist.

1333
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:27,925
All right, okay, okay.
Okay, Rogers.

1334
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,692
Pull that switch
and put the swine on the phone.

1335
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:47,815
Hey, Pops, how's it hanging?

1336
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,908
It's Pixxi.

1337
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,149
Mm-hmm, yeah, wow.

1338
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,660
Anyway, how's Grandma?

1339
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,593
Oh, that's terrible.

1340
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,600
This president's spokesman,

1341
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,194
what did he ask you to do?

1342
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:11,569
Nothing.

1343
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,732
Oh, just slow the train down

1344
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,173
and bring it into Union Station

1345
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,177
around 9:00 p.m.
Instead of right away.

1346
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:22,013
Right, that's when they're going
to announce the legislation.

1347
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:26,043
Well, we're not headed
for Union Station.

1348
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,816
What do you mean?

1349
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,755
What?

1350
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,521
They've switched us
to another track.

1351
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:35,085
We're on our way
back to the desert.

1352
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,561
Oh, phooey.

1353
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,971
"WELCOME TO PALMDALE,
HOME OF THE PREDATOR DRONE"

1354
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,215
Nah.

1355
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:02,587
Oh, Nevada, why not?

1356
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,218
There's no point, really,
in blowing up the desert,

1357
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,852
a place of rare beauty

1358
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:12,162
and an already endangered
ecosystem.

1359
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,099
Yeah.

1360
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:17,661
They want to talk
to our technical expert.

1361
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,074
Hello?

1362
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,574
Walter, is that you?

1363
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:24,669
Willy?

1364
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,771
It's been a long time.

1365
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,976
Are you still working
for the Pentagon?

1366
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:33,283
Ja, ja,
that's the general idea, Walter.

1367
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:39,055
Unlike you, always collaborating
with the Axis of Evil.

1368
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:42,563
It is my disposition,

1369
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:46,032
ever since Papa took us
to the slaughterhouse.

1370
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,762
I've been on the side
of the weak

1371
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,565
against the strong...

1372
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:53,836
especially against Nazi
lickspittles like you, brother.

1373
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,570
Liar.
Liar!

1374
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,271
You were always
a spoiled little brat,

1375
01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:01,009
and now you will die as a result
of your own egotistical schemes.

1376
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,108
Ah, fuck you.

1377
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,948
No! No!
Fuck you!

1378
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,817
In thirty seconds,

1379
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:10,915
my predator drones locked on
that stupid broadcast antenna

1380
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:15,362
on your Caboose
will eradicate you!

1381
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:19,624
Oh, Willy,
pathetic little Willy.

1382
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:24,661
It takes only takes me ten
seconds to lower that antenna.

1383
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,972
Your drones
will miss their target.

1384
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,204
Liar!
Fool!

1385
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,041
Idiot!
You cannot escape me!

1386
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,638
You don't even exist!

1387
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:37,310
You're nothing
but a tabletop expe...

1388
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:57,905
How about dropping
that antenna, Doc?

1389
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:02,842
Remote control deactivated.

1390
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:06,403
Here come the drones.

1391
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,380
Gosh, Pixxi,
you're so damn chill.

1392
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,324
Thanks, Giggli.

1393
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,022
I mean, look at them,
it's pathetic!

1394
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:25,897
And you're handling
all of this so chilly.

1395
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:29,334
Well, you know, it's like
the Book of Bushido says,

1396
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,872
by my friend the Dalai Lama,

1397
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,703
"Always keep death in mind,

1398
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:36,369
"and you won't fail to be
attentive to your employer

1399
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,413
or family duty."

1400
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,745
Sick.

1401
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,978
You know,
I do regret one thing, though.

1402
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,020
What, Pixxi?

1403
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,750
Not having my 3-D printer.

1404
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:53,887
Since we're about to die,

1405
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:57,022
shall we hold hands?

1406
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,863
Check, chiquita.

1407
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:03,998
Thank you.

1408
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,884
And after the train entered
the tunnel, it was easy.

1409
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:20,080
I was able to overpower
my immediate captor

1410
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,352
and free the other hostages.

1411
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,451
All of whom rallied and came
through at the eleventh hour.

1412
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:30,396
In a spirited Caipura-based
counterattack

1413
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,956
on our dispirited kidnappers.

1414
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:37,494
Who were no match
for the ol' USA one-two!

1415
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,867
And that, my friends, was that.

1416
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,773
Praise the Lord!

1417
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:46,336
What happened to these weapons
of mass destruction, the WMDs?

1418
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:51,215
All five backpack devices
were safely accounted for

1419
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:52,878
and have been returned to

1420
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:59,052
the Center for Advanced
Deactivation at Los Alamos.

1421
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,958
What about the three terrorists?

1422
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,496
Were their human rights
respected

1423
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,498
throughout this hectic process?

1424
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:09,833
Well, as Emeritus Secretary
for Terrorist Rights Watch,

1425
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:13,932
let me give you
an appropriate line of bullshit.

1426
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,910
Coo-ee!

1427
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:23,347
Three terrorists?
I thought it was four.

1428
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:28,287
The Mexican,
those two cute little girls.

1429
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:32,918
No, there was only three.

1430
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,986
And six bombs.
He said five.

1431
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:38,965
Wonder where Gray is.

1432
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,097
Who cares about Gray?

1433
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:53,378
Oh, Aguas...

1434
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,516
Hey, Gray.

1435
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,993
Do you ever experience
the feeling that

1436
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:46,967
you might just be a tiny little
simulacrum or an avatar

1437
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:52,200
created by a mad scientist as
part of a tabletop experiment?

1438
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:56,540
Sure, I have that feeling
from time to time.

1439
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,375
And does that make a difference
to you in your actions?

1440
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,347
Wouldn't have it any other way.

1441
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,350
Ah, here comes the bus.

1442
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,318
Check!
