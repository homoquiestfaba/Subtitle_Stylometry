1
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,152
Dowd.
Now, what do I hate?

2
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,220
Boring places.

3
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,287
And?

4
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,355
Wells that aren't
pumping oil.

5
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,823
So what's happening?

6
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,592
Probably our people
being overly cautious.

7
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,693
I'm sure it's nothing.

8
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:07,693
It better be.

9
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:07,693
I bet the whole company
on this site.

10
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:12,231
Woman:<i> Well, the reserve is</i>
<i> several hundred feet deeper,</i>

11
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:12,231
but we have to pass through

12
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,901
what appears to be
a large pocket of
water to reach it.

13
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,704
Water?
Well, let's keep going.

14
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,339
Is that why you
called me down here?

15
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,907
Woman: Discovering water
two miles below the surface

16
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,842
is important,
scientifically.

17
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,444
Dowd, you're
lead scientist here.

18
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,246
Do we care about that?
No.

19
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:27,246
If there's a water pocket,

20
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,582
there's a possibility
of an ecosystem. Life.

21
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,918
Okay. Actually,
it's basically impossible.

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,787
The water pressure
at that depth is 10,000 psi.

23
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,923
That water is supersaturated
with nitrogen.

24
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,391
There would be
no nutrients for life.

25
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,260
So we keep going,
yes?

26
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,729
Yeah. Punch through.

27
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,682
Woman: Bioluminescence.

28
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,417
There is life.

29
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,352
No, that's...

30
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,555
That's the reflection
from our light.

31
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:09,555
What was that?

32
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:09,555
Female automated voice:
<i> Warning.</i>

33
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:13,692
The bore into the pocket
destabilized the well.

34
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,327
The pressure's
rising way too fast.

35
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,762
Woman: There's something's
down there.

36
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,230
We have to shut it down.
Shut it down!

37
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,544
Man: Something came up.
Something came up
through the well!

38
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,030
Man: What is this thing?

39
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,783
He's a real go-getter.

40
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,652
He comes
highly recommended.

41
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,787
Mr. Burke!

42
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,455
Do you have this
under control?

43
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:50,455
We got this one.

44
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:50,455
I have a search party
looking for the other two.

45
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:57,062
Tenneson: It is very important
that you keep your search
discreet.

46
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,399
The department of
fish and wildlife
will shut us down

47
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,801
over a horned lizard,
let alone these things.

48
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,070
Wait. Wait. Wait.
We gotta get somebody
to examine it.

49
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,039
We find out what it eats,
and needs to survive.

50
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,341
It'll help us
find the missing ones

51
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:09,341
and eliminate them.

52
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,044
Also, if there's more
where they came from,

53
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,545
we'll know what
we're dealing with.

54
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,614
That is smart.
But just you.

55
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,316
Okay. I'm on it.

56
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,751
We are standing
on an ocean of oil.

57
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,689
If we keep this quiet,
we will all make out
very well.

58
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,756
Okay.

59
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,025
I'm on it.

60
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,493
Don't let it
out of your sight.

61
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,010
Yeah!

62
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,959
Cindy: So terravex made
some people rich around here.

63
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,628
Big deal.
It doesn't matter.

64
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:36,628
We're making do.

65
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,698
You shouldn't cry
just 'cause you didn't
get a land lease

66
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,099
from an oil company.

67
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:41,099
Who's crying?

68
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,102
Wouldn't take money
from terravex, anyways.

69
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,104
They ruined this town.

70
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,974
You're talking
like you're old enough
to remember how it used to be.

71
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,109
It was never anything
to shout about.

72
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,644
Dad was still here.

73
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,415
I'm gonna stop
at the loaf 'n go
on the way home.

74
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,049
You want anything?

75
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,852
Something with four wheels
that'll get me
out of this place.

76
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,522
Oh.

77
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,524
You're so handsome.

78
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,726
Where are all the girls
knocking down your door?

79
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,132
I'm closing again tonight,
so I won't see you
till tomorrow.

80
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,936
Just one frozen pizza.
You save the other one
for Rick.

81
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,004
Hi.
Hi.

82
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,607
How you doing?
Good. Sorry.

83
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,042
No.
Okay. Bye.

84
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,110
All right.

85
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,087
Tripp.

86
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,690
She said she's not
going to be home till late.

87
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,692
Yeah? Why would that matter?

88
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,195
You're still going to be here
when I get back?

89
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,834
Don't you worry!
I'm not going anywhere.

90
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,723
You enjoy that
a little too much.

91
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,992
Tripp: Where'd this come from?

92
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,228
Mr. weathers:
Pankeska rock.

93
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,163
Big accident up there
at the drill site.

94
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,737
It got late
pretty quick.

95
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,105
Let's strip it tomorrow.

96
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,607
If I come back.

97
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,076
Don't think you're doing me
a favor being here.

98
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,277
I don't take charity.

99
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,279
Tripp: Neither do I.

100
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,621
Tripp: This is
a 6.4 liter hemi v-8.

101
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,090
Probably the only piece
worth anything.

102
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,894
Go ahead, it's yours.

103
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,062
Ha. If anyone can
get it working, you can.

104
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,699
Hey, lock up for me.

105
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,035
Old hulk ain't
what he used to be.

106
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,333
I got 425 horsepower
for you, buddy.

107
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:32,203
You're not gonna be
the prettiest thing in town,

108
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,073
but you're going to have
the heart of an elephant
in you.

109
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:42,314
Outrun that volcano?
You bet we can, Mr. president.

110
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,822
Oh.

111
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,059
What are you doing
in my truck?

112
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,028
Yeah, I can take you
and your sister to Coachella.

113
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,098
Oh. Sisters?

114
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,237
Ah! Kill 'em!

115
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,012
Ejector seat engaged.

116
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:19,718
Announcer on TV:<i> You're</i>
<i> watching kypn, north Dakota,</i>

117
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:19,718
<i> your number one</i>

118
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,789

00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:58,423
<i> I really don't know.</i>

132
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,226
<i> I can't answer</i>
<i> any more questions.</i>

133
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,427
Tripp: You're here?

134
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:38,763
Meredith: I explained to him
that the number of objects

135
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,266
naturally occurring in
the periodic table
of elements...

136
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,001
Tripp! Hey!

137
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,138
Oh, uh... hey.

138
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,809
We were matched up
for biology tutoring?

139
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,078
And you haven't showed up
to any of the sessions?

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,213
Or maybe you didn't get
the schedule? Um...

141
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,816
It was posted in class,
and I emailed you a copy,

142
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,350
and slid one into your locker.

143
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,953
Yeah. I just
haven't checked it yet.

144
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,488
Meredith: Oh, yeah.
I mean, I get it.

145
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,826
I go, like, days sometimes
without checking my email

146
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,260
or going to my locker.

147
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,495
Boy: Ho-ho!

148
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,363
I'm Meredith,
by the way.

149
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,166
Right. Yeah, I knew that.

150
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,236
Sam: Hey, Tripp!

151
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,772
Hey, Sam.
How's the luckiest kid
in town?

152
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,474
You know dad doesn't
let me drive the merch.

153
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,509
Plus, he's flipping out
right now.

154
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,777
What happened?

155
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,044
You want to see
something crazy?

156
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,117
See, I'm growing out
my hair, like you.

157
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,853
Hope people don't
think we're brothers.

158
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:34,853
Mr. geldon:
We've had trouble before,

159
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,255
but usually it's a rock
through the window,

160
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,457
smashed taillight,
that kind of thing.

161
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:39,457
Check it out.

162
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,260
Told you you've never
seen anything like this.

163
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,928
Mr. geldon: They ripped out
the gas tanks.

164
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,531
I mean,
who would even do that?

165
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,134
Well, it has to be vandals.

166
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,870
Serious power tools.

167
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:51,870
Meredith:
Tripp, you know what?

168
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:56,941
I happen to have the schedule
for our tutoring right here,

169
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,878
and it says our next sessions
are Thursday and Friday.

170
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,012
This Friday.

171
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,548
Uh, I have work Friday.

172
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,283
I can come by your work!

173
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,351
See you later, Tripp!

174
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,353
Good to hang out
with you, bro.

175
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,516
It's on the far side.
Here. Come on.

176
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,734
Where is it?
It's in there.

177
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,103
We're gonna need
more guys.

178
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,504
What is it? A bear?

179
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,441
No. Just open it up
and look.

180
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:17,108
Grab that.

181
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,182
You're going to need, like,
12 more of those things.

182
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,622
It's in there.

183
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,191
I don't see anything.

184
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,094
What? No, I...

185
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,496
No, no, no.
I trapped him in here!
He had...

186
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,033
He was huge.
He had tentacles and giant

187
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,302
eyes.

188
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,441
You guys go on ahead.
I'll handle this.

189
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,513
Rick, I know
what you're thinking,

190
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,750
but you've got to
believe me. He...

191
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,019
He sucked all the oil
out of the can!

192
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,554
He sucked it out.
Are you done? Huh?

193
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,123
I knew it.

194
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,393
I knew it as soon as I heard
it was you on the call.

195
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,661
I knew something
wasn't gonna go right.

196
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,531
You thought this
would be funny, huh?

197
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,434
Pranking me and my guys?
Making me look like an idiot?

198
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,668
I saw it.

199
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,570
Yeah. Well,
i hope it was fun.

200
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,439
You're gonna wind
up just like your dad

201
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,207
if you don't
straighten out.

202
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,110
Don't talk about my dad.

203
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,483
That's it for you. That's it.

204
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,732
Meredith: I feel so squeezed
in here, like trapped.

205
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,401
Like, I might die here
if I don't get one
of those scholarships,

206
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,303
because we can't afford
an out-of-state school.

207
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,572
But there's no way I can
imagine staying here, either.

208
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,441
I mean, did you see
that thing on the news?

209
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,176
About the burning well?

210
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:58,176
It's like, nobody cares

211
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,712
about how much
damage they're doing
to the environment because

212
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,348
all the money in town
comes from terravex oil.

213
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,417
Hey, you know a lot
about biology, right?

214
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,754
That's what
I'm tutoring you in.

215
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,090
How often do they discover
new species?

216
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,291
Seriously?

217
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,193
I was just watching
a show on this.

218
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,395
Do you watch nat geo?

219
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,463
No.

220
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:19,297
Oh.

221
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:26,504
Well, um, they said that
they discover, like,
15,000 new species every year.

222
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:26,504
So, would it be possible
for there to be,

223
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:30,808
like, a giant sea creature
here in north Dakota?

224
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:32,343
Technically, totally.

225
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:36,380
This whole state was under
an ocean at one point.

226
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:36,380
So theoretically,

227
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:40,885
the deep lakes
could have something
like that.

228
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:44,222
I mean on land.
A giant sea creature on land.

229
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:44,222
Well, no.

230
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:49,360
Because its body evolved
in a water environment,

231
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,796
so it wouldn't be able to move
with the effects of gravity
pulling on it.

232
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,897
Did you want to
watch that show?

233
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,799
'Cause I have it
on my dvr.

234
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,434
It's 4:00.
I'll see you later.

235
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,344
Come on.

236
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,715
Come on.

237
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,605
Hmm?

238
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,320
No, no, no.

239
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,522
Come on.

240
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,990
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

241
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,859
Shit.

242
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,002
Ugh!

243
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,017
I'm trying to help you!

244
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,599
Let go of me!
I just saved your life!

245
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,052
See? You would have
been flat as a pancake,

246
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:38,723
you squishy piece of squish!

247
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,479
What are you?

248
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,163
You want the oil?

249
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,634
You promise not to eat me?

250
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,646
Hey! Don't even touch me!

251
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,466
You got to be kidding me.

252
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,141
You better slow down there.

253
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,076
You're getting
all jacked up.

254
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,220
What?
You don't like that truck?

255
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,557
Okay. Watch this.

256
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,496
See? It can't hurt you.

257
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,744
Ooh.

258
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,521
Whoa!

259
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,995
Can I help you, sir?

260
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,064
Yeah.
We're working for terravex.

261
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,733
We had something crash through
our fences last night.

262
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,070
No one got a good look at it,
but it was big,
whatever it was.

263
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,672
You get any reports
of anything like that
in the last day?

264
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,075
No, dude,
we haven't heard any of that.

265
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,142
Burke: Nothing strange?

266
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,814
No calls about seeing
some kind of big animal?

267
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,883
There was the monster
in the junkyard.

268
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,551
Or was it a "giant creature"?

269
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,620
Hey! Hey! Guys!

270
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,622
What did I say?
Enough about that.

271
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,824
Well, I'd like
to hear the story.

272
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,759
Well,
there's not much to tell.

273
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,294
It was a false call.
That's what it was.

274
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:30,294
Where from?

275
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:33,764
Deputy 1: It's weathers'
junkyard, off 112.

276
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,100
Hey!
We just talked about this.

277
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,038
Look, I don't see why
you're so worked up
about a prank call.

278
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,174
I don't see why
you are, either.

279
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,014
Oh, quit being a baby.

280
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,721
There we go.

281
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,023
Let's get you to
the sheriff's station.

282
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,058
See what Rick
has to say now.

283
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,712
What the...

284
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,953
Hey! Get back here!

285
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,830
Hey! Whoa! Stop!

286
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,699
Stay! Stay put!

287
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,168
Stay put!

288
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,769
Listen...

289
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,838
Nobody's listening to me!

290
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,776
Not so tough,
are you now, landsquid?

291
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,725
You are so

292
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,260
smelly.

293
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,998
No. No, no, no.

294
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,805
Hey!

295
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,143
Get back here!

296
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,147
Oh, no, no, no.

297
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,249
If you scratch my truck,
so help me!

298
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,431
Can I help you?

299
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,234
I understand you had
an incident last night,

300
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,903
but the local authorities
didn't believe you.

301
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,706
Explain why you care?

302
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,441
We're looking for
something unusual.

303
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,044
Something dangerous.

304
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,979
What are you looking
to do with it?

305
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:05,182
Make sure
it doesn't hurt no one.

306
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,251
Well, I thought
i heard something.
I didn't see anything.

307
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:10,320
Must have been a coyote,
or something like that.

308
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,256
Did this coyote come back?

309
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,457
No.

310
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:14,725
Mind if we take a look?

311
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:14,725
Yes, actually.

312
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:20,397
Because it's private property
and you're not allowed to
go in there,

313
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,001
but, uh, go ahead
and look around,
if you want to.

314
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,470
I can make
an exception this time.

315
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,139
Oh.

316
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:47,024
You know, uh,
the coyote that I saw...
I heard, was, um...

317
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:51,962
I think it came from
that side of the yard.

318
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,764
Uh... for sure, actually.

319
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,032
From that side of the yard?

320
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,900
Uh... yeah.

321
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,376
Stop it! Stop it!

322
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,513
Will you stop?

323
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,917
Search the whole place.

324
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:22,392
Ah. The battery's dead.

325
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,895
I'm going to push it over
to the other garage.

326
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,164
You guys just
keep looking around.

327
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:39,943
Hey!

328
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,881
Give me back my truck!

329
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,228
Hey!

330
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,437
Give me back my truck!

331
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,009
Meredith: Tripp?

332
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,280
I made flash cards!

333
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,081
Meredith?

334
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,051
What are you...

335
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:24,054
Look, seriously,
now is a really bad time.

336
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,889
Oh, okay.

337
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,593
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?

338
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:29,593
I don't live too far away.

339
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:34,097
But it was kind
of a scary walk
in the dark.

340
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,332
I, uh...
I don't have a car.

341
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,404
It doesn't run.

342
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,174
It's not...

343
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,346
Uh... can you, uh,
just go home?

344
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,414
Please.

345
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,518
It's kind of rude of you
not to give me a ride home.

346
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,087
I came all the way over here
on Friday night

347
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,122
to help you study,

348
00:30:59,124 --> 00:30:59,122
and you're just
sending me away?

349
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:03,093
How would you feel
if I got abducted
on my way home?

350
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,561
Who's gonna abduct you?

351
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,497
It's not what I mean.

352
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,000
It just...
It doesn't happen out here.

353
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,371
What was that?

354
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,939
Man: I heard it, too.

355
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:15,939
Hey, kid!

356
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,343
You should
probably put that in park.

357
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,947
Hey! Why don't you
just get in the truck?

358
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,216
Really?
Yeah. Just get in.

359
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,284
Oh...

360
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,186
Whoop! Oh!

361
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,226
Listen, there's
something going on here.

362
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,161
Really?

363
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:38,161
Yeah, something crazy.

364
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,531
And I don't even know
how to begin to explain it.

365
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,600
You don't have to.
I mean...

366
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,437
I feel it, too.

367
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,907
Uh, no...

368
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,042
There's...

369
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,511
Just go
if you're going to go!

370
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,147
Go!

371
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,618
Burke: That kid
knows something.

372
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,255
You know, I can drive manual
if you don't know how.

373
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,665
Okay. Well,
at the end of the hill,
turn right.

374
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,104
Right! I said right!

375
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,172
I'm trying!

376
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,047
Stop the car!
I can't! Nothing's working.

377
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,049
Ah!

378
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,518
Put your hands
on the wheel!
I...

379
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,188
This isn't doing anything!

380
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,423
Yeah. I know!

381
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,358
Whoa...

382
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,594
Tree, tree, tree!

383
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,278
There's a paved road
that goes to my house.

384
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,693
Do you even have your license?

385
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,662
Shh.

386
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,379
Did you just steal this?
Did we just steal this?

387
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,581
Okay, get out!

388
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,184
You hear me?

389
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,419
Get out!

390
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:46,356
You were the one
who pushed me into your truck!

391
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,625
Give me my truck back!

392
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,427
Who are you talking to?

393
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:51,795
That!

394
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,398
Whoa!

395
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,466
Whoa! Was that a snake?

396
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,070
Tripp, what is that?

397
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,474
Take a look and see.

398
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,510
Take a look?

399
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,479
He won't hurt you.

400
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,635
What!

401
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,638
Oh, my gosh. What is that?

402
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,373
Tripp!

403
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,442
Ah! Fine,
just keep the truck!

404
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,244
You said you live close,
right? Let's go.

405
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,281
Are you just gonna...

406
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,349
I mean,
seriously, Tripp, what...

407
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,455
It's, uh, moving the truck.

408
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,095
Okay.

409
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,732
My dad barely comes in here,

410
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,669
so you should be
fine for the night.

411
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,205
Think he'd mind if
i borrowed some of this stuff?

412
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,674
I'll pay him back.

413
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,610
I doubt he'd even notice.
But for what?

414
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,880
So I can pry creature here
out of my truck.

415
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,482
Good luck with that.

416
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,687
Yeah. My curfew is in, like,
two minutes, so...

417
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,828
Thank you for
the incredibly weird night!

418
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,566
Please don't let it
near my horse.

419
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,569
Okay.

420
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,517
Hey, hey, hey!

421
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,185
Sit still, would you?

422
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,721
Hey!

423
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,868
Oh.

424
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,710
Huh.

425
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:42,025
Dowd: Now,
it's not just this one pocket
that's blocking our oil.

426
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:45,695
It is a massive,
interconnected ecosystem,

427
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,430
untouched for
millions of years.

428
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,965
I mean,
it's basically a certainty

429
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,767
that there are more of
those things down there.

430
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,303
Prehistoric amphibians,
that can breathe water or air,

431
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,904
living in a network
of underground lakes
and caves.

432
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,774
It's like
the loch ness monster
isn't a myth after all.

433
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,376
Can we access it?

434
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,711
Well, there's a crater lake
on the surface,

435
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:05,048
and, yeah,
the vents that feed the lake
lead directly down there.

436
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,850
Could we get equipment there?
Hmm.

437
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,719
Well, it was
a pretty rough drive
in my Jeep.

438
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,755
There's a good dirt road
after the strip mine,

439
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:13,857
but after that
it's all off-road.

440
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,060
Good job.

441
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,363
What about our pows?

442
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,865
Well, we're still
working on it,

443
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:25,669
but if that third one
is alive out there somewhere,

444
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,003
we'll find it.

445
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,417
Stop! Stop.
Give me some space.

446
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,088
Meredith: Morning.
Tripp: Morning.

447
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,624
So, instead of
getting him out of there,

448
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,759
you built more stuff
to keep him in.

449
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,961
This thing is
kind of awesome.

450
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,097
Like, strong and smart.
Really smart.

451
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,733
He can learn anything, fast.

452
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:00,837
Oh, and I gave him a name.
Isn't that right, creech?

453
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,972
You named him creech?

454
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:07,410
He's got these
hair-like things
on its tentacles.

455
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,979
Cilia, right?

456
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,649
They can generate
a massive amount of torque,

457
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:13,983
especially once
i scored the axles

458
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,785
to make more
surface area to grip.

459
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,886
And that's at each tire.

460
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:16,886
So, imagine
the angular velocity

461
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:20,357
when it's not all spread out
from one differential.

462
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,460
You're not dumb.

463
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:24,728
What?

464
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,795
Nothing.

465
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,864
Um...

466
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,532
So...

467
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,469
I press the gas,

468
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:36,539
the throttle wire
pulls these levers,
which open these blinders.

469
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,681
Right? Right?

470
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,882
It's like

471
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,018
the truck's
a wheelchair for it.

472
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,022
Uh, no. It's like...

473
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,627
It is an engine
for my truck.

474
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,098
Watch.

475
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,848
Yes! Yes! Yes!

476
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,058
Did you see that?

477
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,200
Okay.

478
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,670
Hey!

479
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,673
See, it's not so hard.

480
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,676
Okay.

481
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,479
Come on.

482
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,775
You got it!

483
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,778
Whoo!

484
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,716
Show-off!

485
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,070
No way!

486
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,906
Whoa!

487
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,011
Lift this up,
would you?

488
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,089
Stop.

489
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,578
Meredith:<i> But this thing</i>
<i> is important, right?</i>

490
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:28,578
<i> Shouldn't we tell somebody?</i>

491
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,181
Tripp:<i> You think</i>
<i> he'll be better off</i>
<i> with somebody poking at him,</i>

492
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:32,181
<i> trying to figure</i>
<i> out what he is?</i>

493
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:36,319
First of all, how do you
know that it's a "he"?

494
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,722
And secondly,
as a youth for
animal rights activist,

495
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,859
I feel responsible
for the well-being
of that animal.

496
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,795
Tripp:<i> He's fine.</i>
<i> He's happy.</i>

497
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,266
Hey!

498
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:50,934
Hey, stop!

499
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:54,938
Meredith:<i> I'm just saying,</i>
<i> he came from somewhere.</i>

500
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:54,938
<i> He has a home.</i>

501
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:54,938
<i> Don't you think</i>
<i> he wants to go back there?</i>

502
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:00,677
Tripp:<i> Sure,</i>
<i> but he's safe in here</i>
<i> in the meantime.</i>

503
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,745
<i> Besides, he's having fun.</i>

504
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,815
<i> He's like a kid with</i>
<i> his first tricycle.</i>

505
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,218
I'm going to see
my dad at pankeska.

506
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,155
Was he at pankeska rock
when that accident happened?

507
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,957
Yeah.

508
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,760
Meredith: I'm coming with you.

509
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,972
Okay, creech,
let's get you fed.

510
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,114
I'll get you back.

511
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,625
Uh...

512
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,995
Great.

513
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,812
Hey.

514
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:11,814
Hey.

515
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,884
I like your truck.

516
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,355
What is this?

517
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,824
You know
what this looks like?

518
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:26,095
This looks like
if a garbage truck
took a dump.

519
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:30,099
And not like a normal dump.
Like a really bad one.

520
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,434
That's what this looks like.

521
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,439
Thanks.
Anytime.

522
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,743
Ouch.

523
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,471
That sound weird to you?

524
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,141
How is a monster living
in the hood of your car

525
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,810
supposed to sound?

526
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:15,211
He's probably fine.

527
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,215
Um... okay.
Why is he moving like this?

528
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,950
I don't know.
He's hyper.

529
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,318
Why would he be hyper
all of a sudden?

530
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,890
It's what he ate.
Gasoline is oil, but with...

531
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,225
Added chemicals!

532
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:36,966
What the...

533
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,470
Okay. I think now is
a good time to take charge.

534
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,205
Let go!
I can see better than you.

535
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,176
Meredith: Uh...

536
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:50,079
Hey, what are you doing?
Get back in there!

537
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,982
Tripp! Tripp!
Watch out!

538
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,317
Tripp: Oh, no.
What are you doing?

539
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,387
Tripp: No, no, no!

540
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,292
Get back in there!
I'm driving!

541
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,431
I said, let go!

542
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,968
Oh, gosh, I touched his eye!

543
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:23,346
Tripp: No, no, no.

544
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:27,550
Watch me unload this lemon
on old man overalls here.

545
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,854
No! No! No!

546
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,397
Okay. Right!

547
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,974
Sorry.

548
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,810
Okay, new rule,

549
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:55,344
no feeding creature gasoline.

550
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,184
So, you don't like
the bacteria cultures, huh?

551
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,920
How about nematodes?

552
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,994
Don't like those, either.

553
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,430
Hmm.

554
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,399
Well...

555
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,606
You must eat
something out there
under those oil beds.

556
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,031
Hi.

557
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,060
Dad?

558
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,130
Hey, dad.

559
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,132
It's Tripp.

560
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,067
Tripp.

561
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:30,072
Well, it sure is.
Look at you.

562
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,208
Ah. Don't want to get
my grime all over you.

563
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,276
Right.

564
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,279
This yours?

565
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:38,547
Yeah.

566
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:42,351
The truck, not the girl.
I figured the girl's yours.

567
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:44,153
No.
Not really.

568
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:46,155
Hi. I'm Meredith.

569
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,024
Wade.

570
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,359
This is something.

571
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,694
This is solid.

572
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,629
This is solid work.

573
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,965
Yeah. Thanks.

574
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,300
Come on up.

575
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,302
Why don't you park it
at my trailer?

576
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,604
I'm just gonna call my guys,
tell them I won't be
at the bar.

577
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:02,672
Yeah.

578
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:13,115
It's small,
but it's a roof and a bed.

579
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,951
It's only temporary
for work, right?

580
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,586
I mean, you have
a permanent place somewhere?

581
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,189
Uh, yeah, well,
this does the job.

582
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,191
I'm not inside much, anyway.

583
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:24,527
They got us
working 12-hour shifts.

584
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:30,066
Were you working when,
uh, that accident happened?

585
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh, yeah.

586
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:34,737
There's all these rumors
i read online about it.

587
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,138
What happened?

588
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,310
This stays in here, all right?

589
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:41,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

590
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:45,748
They drug something
out of the ground that night.

591
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,418
Pushed so far down,

592
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,290
it was like the earth got mad
and let something bad out.

593
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,996
But they say
it was a pocket of gas,

594
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,565
so I guess it was
a pocket of gas, huh?

595
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:03,632
Yeah.

596
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,302
What do I know?

597
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,237
Right?

598
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,443
I left something on the bus.

599
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:16,312
You guys stay here,
I'll be right back.

600
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,580
We'll have some wings.

601
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,686
Well, at least we know
where that thing came from.

602
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:29,525
Those guys the other night
must have been from terravex.

603
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,061
They don't want
anyone to know
about the creature.

604
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,529
Well, they
wouldn't be able to drill

605
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:37,566
if there was some
new species living
on top of the oil.

606
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,669
I'm gonna go
check on him.

607
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,539
Probably not good
to leave him alone long.

608
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,545
Dad?

609
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,148
These men want to have
a word with you, Tripp.

610
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,549
They want
their truck back.

611
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,618
Their truck? I built that!

612
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,686
Look. Your mother
called me last night.

613
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,288
She saw me on TV,

614
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,091
thought you'd maybe come
up here and try to find me.

615
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:03,826
You sold me out.
To them.

616
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:05,227
I'm not selling you out
to no one.

617
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,495
I just wanna do what's best.

618
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,165
For who?

619
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,300
We just want to
talk to you, son.
Watch it!

620
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:12,368
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

621
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,836
Yes, you are.

622
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:15,137
Wade: Just listen
to him, Tripp.

623
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,572
You're not the police.

624
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,107
You don't have
the right to take him.

625
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:20,709
This is private property.
Our private property.

626
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:22,578
Get off of me!

627
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,857
Get in the truck.
Get in the truck.

628
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,196
I'll hurt you, kid.

629
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,865
I will.

630
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,547
It's the truck!
That thing is in the truck!

631
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,351
Yeah, I'm just pulling in now.

632
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,220
Listen, I don't want you
to worry, okay?

633
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,288
If he's here,
I'll have him home by dinner.

634
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,531
Move over! I'm driving!

635
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,167
Oh, really?

636
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,572
I gotta go.

637
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:33,782
Tripp?

638
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,264
Whoo!

639
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:49,331
Yes!

640
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:53,669
Tripp!

641
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,213
What the heck
is going on here?

642
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,552
Big truck,

643
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:10,819
big truck, big truck!

644
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:13,289
Tripp.

645
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:16,959
No. I'm not stopping
and I'm not giving up
the truck.

646
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:18,961
No. Go faster!

647
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,781
Okay. We got him.

648
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:41,383
Fan out. Cut him off.
Don't let him out of town.

649
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,971
We're not gonna fit.
I think we can do it.

650
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,410
It worked!

651
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,785
Move! Go!

652
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,628
Whoa!

653
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,985
What?

654
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,694
Did you train him
to do this?

655
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,696
Yes.

656
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,033
Ah...

657
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:06,435
I have no idea
how he learned this.

658
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,687
Did that just happen?

659
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:25,754
Oh, yeah, it did!

660
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,428
Uh...

661
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,435
Wall!

662
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:40,769
Watch this.

663
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,777
Oh!

664
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,984
Oh...
We're driving on a roof.

665
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:58,354
Tripp: Get out of
our way, pigeons!

666
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,131
Whoa! Did you see that?

667
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,973
Tripp: Hang on!

668
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,108
No way.

669
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,377
I want to stay
on the roof now!

670
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,723
Did you hear that?
The train.

671
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,125
So what?

672
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:36,125
That thing
is five miles long.

673
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,660
If we can put that
in between us and them,

674
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:40,829
we'll get
a 10 minute head start.

675
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,765
Oh. How about a plan b?

676
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:44,633
Tripp: No time
for a plan b.

677
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,969
Besides,
i think we lost them.

678
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,202
Tripp, I don't think
we're going to make it.

679
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:21,503
We'll make it!

680
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,007
We're not going fast enough!

681
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,180
Slow down!

682
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:32,448
Brakes!

683
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:34,883
Tripp!

684
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,174
Yeah! Way to go, creech!

685
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,848
Hey! What are you doing,
chasing that boy
all over my county?

686
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,149
It's a private
company security matter!

687
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,851
You're putting
lives in danger.

688
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:08,851
You're interfering
with law enforcement!

689
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:13,255
The company I'm working for
employs everyone in this town,

690
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:15,224
and that includes you!

691
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:18,093
When's the next election,
sheriff?

692
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:21,930
Go back to writing tickets
and shooing cows off the road.

693
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,047
You really
saved me back there.

694
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:42,184
Thanks, you big,
ugly, beautiful blob.

695
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,854
My dad only uses this
during hunting season, so...

696
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,022
You said there was oil?

697
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:47,022
Yeah.

698
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,727
But it's for the generator,
so we won't have electricity.

699
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,198
That's okay. He deserves it.

700
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,541
It's nicer out here.

701
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,610
Yeah, I don't mind.

702
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,250
Are you scared of fire?

703
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,621
Meredith: I would be, too,
if I drank oil.

704
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:29,565
Tripp, I'm sorry
about your dad.

705
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,200
It would have been a lousy
place to stay, anyways.

706
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,671
I mean,

707
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:35,671
how weird would it have been

708
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:39,207
if he'd turned out
to be a decent guy, right?

709
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,642
What would that
have been like?

710
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,715
You wouldn't be who you are.

711
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:51,320
And there's no one like you
at our school.

712
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,722
Or in our town.

713
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,926
So,

714
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,000
that's something to
thank your dad for, at least.

715
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:56,118
God!

716
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,864
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

717
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,301
Hey, hey.

718
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

719
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,874
Hey. What are you doing?

720
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:23,979
Hey.

721
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,083
No.

722
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,076
I'm going to get you home.

723
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,811
I promise you that.

724
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,418
Thank you.

725
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,088
I love you, too.

726
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,958
Ready? Watch.

727
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,050
You could teach a mouse
how to do that.

728
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:12,921
That's not the amazing part.
This is the amazing part.

729
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,076
I didn't teach that one
to do that for the oil.

730
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:38,480
I taught that one
how to do that for the oil.

731
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:41,416
They have hive intelligence,
like, um, ants or bees.

732
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:42,884
When they're in
close proximity,

733
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,286
one of them knows
what the other knows,

734
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:44,286
almost immediately.

735
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:50,125
And they metabolize oil
like a combustion engine.

736
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,428
Dowd, what are you doing?

737
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,499
I'm a scientist.

738
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,501
I'm being a scientist.
No.

739
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,070
You are falling in love.

740
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,306
This is some sort of
Stockholm syndrome.

741
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:06,842
That's backwards.

742
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:06,842
Whatever.
Okay.

743
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:11,446
Look, in two days,
our wastewater goes to Ohio.

744
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,982
The mucous twins go with.

745
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:17,185
Going to shoot it down deep
into an injection well.

746
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,988
No trace.

747
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,992
No. They're not like
mindless ground slugs.

748
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:27,062
They have intelligence,
they show emotion.

749
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:29,264
It would be
unethical to kill them.

750
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,398
Unethical?

751
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,469
Dowd, you and I have been
together a long time.

752
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:38,139
I have seen you
stretch the truth,

753
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:41,009
falsify environmental
protection reports,

754
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,611
and lie to the media.

755
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,347
We are in this together.

756
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,183
Cheer up.

757
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,219
And keep those things quiet!

758
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,911
Tripp. Tripp!

759
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,045
What are you doing?

760
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,113
He's gone.

761
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:23,985
Creech!

762
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,003
Why would he leave?

763
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:45,206
I don't know,
but we better find him
before they do.

764
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,309
Yeah, well, he took off
with my cell phone,

765
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:50,078
so I can't even call anybody
to come pick us up.

766
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,080
It's okay. I have mine.

767
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:53,949
Wait, your cell phone's
in the truck?

768
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:55,016
Yeah.

769
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,955
I have an app.
We can track him.

770
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,496
Meredith: There he is.

771
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:10,031
Where is he going?

772
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,299
Tripp: I don't know.

773
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,438
It's here.
Stop, stop here.

774
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,445
Tripp: Wait. Terravex?

775
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,246
Are you sure
this is far enough?

776
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:27,015
Would you mind dropping us off
at the end of the block?

777
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,312
He's not there.

778
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,349
Maybe he went inside.

779
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:00,809
What is that?

780
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,412
I don't know.

781
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,292
He came here for them.

782
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,761
That's why he left.

783
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,771
No, don't! Don't!

784
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,173
Hey, guys,
check on warehouse three.

785
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,710
Tripp: No! Stop! Stop!

786
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,816
Man: Slow it down.
Tranquilize it!

787
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:42,884
No!

788
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,556
Hey! Stop.
Shoot it!

789
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:52,627
Stop!

790
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,329
Stop! You're killing him!

791
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,213
Scrape it up.

792
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:18,586
Bring them with me.

793
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,670
Well, you certainly
love your cats.

794
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,372
It's all cats.

795
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,375
Oh! Here we go.

796
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,379
Delete. Delete. Delete.

797
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,649
Delete.

798
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:48,316
Thank you.

799
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:51,786
You can't just delete pictures
and think this goes away.

800
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,856
Why? What are you going to do?

801
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:54,856
Go to the police and tell them

802
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:58,660
that there are monsters
coming up out of
the oil fields?

803
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,497
How'd that work out
for you last time?

804
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,866
Look.

805
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:08,536
Hurting people,
is not my thing.

806
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,273
It's his.

807
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,878
Mr. Burke,

808
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,813
show these two the highway.

809
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,684
Let's go!

810
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:23,618
To your left.

811
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:29,490
Okay!
I'll take them from here.
Thanks, Charlie.

812
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,226
Tenneson's orders.
So, it all checks out.

813
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,327
Just keep walking normally.

814
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,462
Get your hands
off us, slimebag.

815
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,764
Okay,
it's not slime, it's sweat.
I sweat when I'm nervous.

816
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:39,234
Thanks for calling
attention to it. Look.

817
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:40,902
I'm on your side.
What?

818
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:42,770
Spiritually.

819
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,339
Okay, I'm messing this up.

820
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,641
Sorry. I'm a scientist,
a geologist.

821
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,309
But I want to help you.

822
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:48,910
Why?

823
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:53,414
Because I can't
just stand here
and watch them die.

824
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,253
And why should
we trust you?

825
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,354
Because these creatures
are special.

826
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:01,389
I think that
you've seen that, too.

827
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:03,391
Now,

828
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:06,928
I've done some bad things
for this company. But this...

829
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,030
No way. Okay?

830
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:11,633
I'm done doing
their dirty work.

831
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:13,501
Okay, then help us
get them out of here.

832
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:14,669
We need to get them home.

833
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:14,669
It's not that simple.

834
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:18,039
Okay. It's 50 miles
of rough terrain
back to the vent.

835
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,307
Any truck big enough
to carry them

836
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:21,276
would be too slow
and we'd get caught.

837
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:24,412
I got a truck fast enough.
We just gotta find two more.

838
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,818
If you think
we can do this, I'm in.

839
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:31,886
We can.

840
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:34,856
Okay, hands in.

841
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,793
I'm sorry.
You're just so sweaty.

842
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,439
Mr. weathers,

843
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,541
there's a lot of
really weird stuff
going on right now

844
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:54,709
and I need your help.

845
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:56,577
What do you need?

846
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:58,413
I need trucks.

847
01:11:58,415 --> 01:11:59,847
Do you have any
on your repo list?

848
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,357
It's not our fault rich boy
can't make his payments.

849
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,397
Boy: Yeah!

850
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:17,999
Boom!

851
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,704
Show me something! Come on!

852
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,405
Yeah! Keep tagging him!

853
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:57,505
I don't see anything on this

854
01:12:57,507 --> 01:13:00,675
that will carry
that big sucker
i saw in the warehouse.

855
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:02,944
What are you gonna need
to do to these trucks?

856
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,779
Well,

857
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:07,915
lift the engine,
raise the suspension,

858
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:10,885
cut up the body,
customize the axles,

859
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,888
and maximize the airflow.
All by morning. Twice.

860
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,492
Maybe we'd get
one done, but two?

861
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:21,662
I don't have
the tools or the parts
to get it done that quick.

862
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:24,932
Do you know someone
with a repair shop?

863
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:27,001
Or...
A dealership.

864
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,444
You know, you're
going to have to, like,

865
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:39,414
hang out with him
and stuff after this.

866
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,948
Maybe once.

867
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,450
You'll be out
by 7:00, right?

868
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:45,086
The first workers
get here at 7:00.

869
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:46,554
Yeah.

870
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:48,790
What's the best truck
you got on the lot?

871
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,692
Sam: Well,
it's supposed to be
my 16th birthday present.

872
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,494
No harm getting
an early peek, right?

873
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,502
Can you handle one of these?

874
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,171
Uh, yeah.

875
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:13,114
Be careful,
it'll run away from you.

876
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,604
Here you go. Drink up.

877
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,673
We're going on
a little road trip.

878
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,829
Hey, man, you mind
helping me out with this?

879
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,731
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

880
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,767
Come on, man.
Let's pick it up.

881
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:14,769
Got to get those things
to the wastewater tank

882
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:15,937
before they ship out.

883
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:21,142
What's got into these things?

884
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,113
Hey!

885
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,819
Hey! Hey!

886
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:37,158
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

887
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,160
Yeah, get Burke
on the phone.

888
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:42,296
And start a trace
on the box truck.
The big one.

889
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,102
Dowd.

890
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,049
Hey, I got them,
but there's not much time.

891
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,719
Tenneson probably already
has Burke coming for us.

892
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:06,754
Hey. Nice job.

893
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:06,754
Thank you.

894
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:10,992
I never drove a stick before.
It was very exciting.

895
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:12,093
Cool. Want to give me
a hand with this?

896
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:13,194
Yeah.

897
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,279
Wow.

898
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,715
Well, I'll be...

899
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,896
Hey, there.

900
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:51,232
You're looking good.

901
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,767
For you.

902
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,909
Okay. Okay.

903
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,247
Yeah, I missed you.

904
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:08,049
I missed you, too.

905
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,197
They're a family.

906
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:28,069
Meredith: He was looking
for his parents.

907
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:50,024
I got the truck.
It's stationary.

908
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:52,960
Load up!
Let's go! We got them!

909
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:12,513
No turning back now.

910
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,519
All right, this one's yours.

911
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:20,321
Someone say
I'm coming with you?

912
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:22,256
Come on, man, we need you.

913
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:24,792
Okay.

914
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:30,397
If I'm going to go to prison,
it might as well be in style.

915
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,466
Okay.
The vents are marked on this.
I'll follow you.

916
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:33,968
Yeah.

917
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:37,004
You said these guys have
hive intelligence, right?

918
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,072
Yeah.

919
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:39,874
Well, then he'll know
what to do.

920
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,041
You're just there
to guide him.

921
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:43,010
Right.
Be gentle, but firm.

922
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,044
That opens.

923
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:44,044
Let him know
you're the one steering.

924
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:48,015
Right. Gentle but firm.
I'm the one steering.

925
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,517
Uh... okay.

926
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,256
Hey.

927
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,027
Go do this. Yeah.

928
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,363
Thanks, Mr. weathers.

929
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,373
<i> Hope you picked something up</i>
<i> from watching me.</i>

930
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,584
A week ago,
you were riding a bicycle.

931
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,929
Uh... welcome to geldon dodge.

932
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,964
Can we get you a cup
of complimentary coffee?

933
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,401
They're on the move.

934
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,203
What?

935
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,139
What about the next slide?

936
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,342
They're on the move in what?

937
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,426
These guys were
ready for a walk.

938
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:07,261
They're happy
they're going home.

939
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,236
Man:
<i> We just picked them up</i>
<i> on a police scanner.</i>

940
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:15,236
<i> Off old cutler road.</i>

941
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:18,172
<i> It's close,</i>
<i> about a mile south.</i>

942
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:20,374
Burke: There they are.
Ten o'clock.

943
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:30,417
Here we go.

944
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:34,121
I can't believe I let you
and your girlfriend
talk me into this.

945
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,523
Uh, we're not...
That's not, uh...

946
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:37,925
<i> Are we?</i>

947
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,898
Deputy:<i> Hey, sheriff,</i>
<i> we got a call from</i>
<i> Ken Galloway.</i>

948
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,666
<i> Said a bunch of trucks</i>
<i> rode over his land.</i>

949
01:21:45,668 --> 01:21:48,335
<i> He said they looked</i>
<i> like monster trucks.</i>

950
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:50,004
Yeah, which way
were they headed?

951
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,612
Okay, let's take out
big green first.

952
01:21:58,614 --> 01:21:58,612
Man 1:<i> I'll take left.</i>

953
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:01,148
Man 2:<i> Roger that.</i>
<i> Taking right.</i>

954
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:05,519
Uh-oh.

955
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,161
He needs help.

956
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:16,230
Tripp:
<i> Get behind him, Meredith.</i>
<i> Give him a push.</i>

957
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,189
Oh, what?

958
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,992
Oh, I really hope
they had their seatbelts on.

959
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,467
Tripp:<i> We can't outrun</i>
<i> them in the flats.</i>

960
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:54,735
Just hang on.
We'll lose them in the rough.

961
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,981
Burke: Stay close here, guys.
It's going to get tight.

962
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:08,482
We'll get them on the Ridge.

963
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,750
Do we know where we're going?

964
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:11,352
Don't worry, they know.

965
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,255
Uh, downed tree, dead ahead!
Do we have a tree plan?

966
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:18,058
Okay, guys. And pull!

967
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,135
Okay, dowd,
you can open your eyes now.

968
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:30,371
Did we make it?

969
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:43,017
Everybody, stay close.
It's going to
get tight up here.

970
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:48,722
Meredith:
<i> They're right behind me!</i>

971
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,227
<i> Tripp, on your right!</i>

972
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,802
Burke: All right, kid,
this is where your
little joyride ends!

973
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,152
Help!

974
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:57,724
Tripp!

975
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:22,816
Thanks, buddy!

976
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,374
Meredith:<i> Tripp, are you okay?</i>

977
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:48,442
Tripp:<i> Yeah, yeah. I'm...</i>

978
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:51,411
What is that?

979
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,282
Oh, tenneson.

980
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,619
It's poison!
We gotta stop that tanker.

981
01:25:58,621 --> 01:25:59,653
They're going to
poison the nest.

982
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,421
Okay. We need to move faster.

983
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:04,558
Oh, come on!

984
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:26,747
Light it up.

985
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:37,624
Get back! Stay back!

986
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:57,444
Man: We got 'em now!

987
01:26:57,446 --> 01:26:59,346
Man 2: I see 'em!
Go up the left side!

988
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,831
Rick?

989
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,633
Get to the sides!
Get to the sides!

990
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,035
I cannot believe you're here.
I'm actually really happy
to see you.

991
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:57,404
Hey, I told you
i wasn't going anywhere.

992
01:27:57,406 --> 01:27:58,772
The vents are right
on the other side.

993
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,375
We have to get
past this truck.
It's the only way.

994
01:28:01,377 --> 01:28:03,944
Hang, on, Tripp,
you're not seeing
what I'm seeing.

995
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:06,613
No, I got it right here.
I know what we're in for.

996
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,782
I seriously hope you're not
thinking about jumping off
a mountain.

997
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,951
<i> As the only scientist here,</i>
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> they can do that.</i>

998
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,519
We don't have a choice.

999
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:14,521
I hope you know
what you're doing, Tripp.

1000
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:16,723
Rick, give us
something to jump.

1001
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:18,992
Yeah. Okay.

1002
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,706
Tripp, there's a 99% chance
that would be impossible.

1003
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:33,974
Maybe 100%.

1004
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:38,412
You be careful, son.

1005
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:40,647
Rick,
I'm sorry I said all those
terrible things about you.

1006
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:42,516
Wait, what?

1007
01:28:42,518 --> 01:28:43,583
Let's go!

1008
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:53,527
Come on, creech!

1009
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,563
Go, Tripp!

1010
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:30,664
We made it!

1011
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,971
You guys take out the pumps,
I'll handle the tanker.

1012
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:39,639
Meredith:<i> Got it.</i>
Dowd:<i> We're on it.</i>

1013
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,556
Hey, there's another one.

1014
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:59,659
Pumps are at speed!

1015
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,829
We need to stop those pumps.

1016
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,931
Come on. One last push.
You're almost home.

1017
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:13,140
Whoa.

1018
01:30:13,142 --> 01:30:16,710
Any trucks still running,
get up here to the vents.

1019
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:37,497
Can we stop it?
Ah. It locked me out.

1020
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:39,166
If this pressure
gets to 15,000 psi,

1021
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:40,867
the poison will reach
all the way down to the nest.

1022
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:53,013
Come on, buddy, wake up!
You can do it!

1023
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,710
The valves!

1024
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:24,911
Come on, come on!

1025
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,581
Righty-tighty.

1026
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,216
We have to stop the poison!

1027
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:51,605
Dowd: It's not working!
We're too late!

1028
01:31:57,778 --> 01:32:00,113
Go! Get out! Save yourself!

1029
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:34,114
Tripp!

1030
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:36,583
Tripp: We did it.

1031
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,824
I'm going to miss you, creech.

1032
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:03,763
You were a good truck.

1033
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:19,846
Don't worry.
I know where to find you.

1034
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:58,084
Meredith: Tripp!

1035
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,321
Rick: Tripp!

1036
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:04,824
You stay put. We got you.

1037
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:19,072
Meredith:
<i> Hi, fish and wildlife?</i>

1038
01:36:19,074 --> 01:36:21,341
<i> Yeah, my friends and I found</i>
<i> some horned lizards</i>

1039
01:36:21,343 --> 01:36:23,810
<i> on the terravex property.</i>

1040
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:26,279
<i> Are they endangered,</i>
<i> by any chance?</i>

1041
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:44,364
Well, it's nothing
like my old one,

1042
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:46,466
but I think it'll do.

1043
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:48,301
Yeah.

1044
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:50,804
Now you can do
whatever you want this summer.

1045
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,874
Take it as far as it'll go.

1046
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,244
Thanks, Rick.
