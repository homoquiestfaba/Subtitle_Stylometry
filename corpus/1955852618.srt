I steal one?

- No go ahead, have one.
- Thanks.

- Hey!
- Oh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Sure you are.

- Hey, I wasn't
the one who--

5
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,744
- Who was watching
where he was going?

6
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,812
- Oh well, that's me.

charm your way out of this?

Are you making a citizen's
arrest here?

- You're no farmer,
are you?

14
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:09,234
- I could be.

15
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:13,305
- I don't think so. Silk shirt,
Italian jeans, Rolex.

16
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:16,975
- Well, there's good money in
peaches you know.

17
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,844
- How'd you like to get out
of those clothes,

mister peach farmer?

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,850
- My wife might have something
to say about that.

20
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:27,886
- So might my husband.

21
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,229

23
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,869
- So, what does my wife
have to say?

24
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:46,871
- About your way
with words?

25
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:49,107
- No, about my
boyish charm.

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,710
- Charming defenseless women
in the street?

27
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:54,279
- Ha-ha. Hey! It's just...

28

It's just a phase,
it'll pass.

29
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:59,184

to do with it, it won't.

00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,128
- No, no!
- I have got to.

33
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,130
- You are not indispensable.
- Come on.

34
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,965
- You're not indispensable.
Not to them.

35
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,001
- Luckily they have not figured
that out yet.

Hey Nabil.

37
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:24,776
Oh, not much. Just meeting with
a very important client.

Very important.

Hmmph! It looks like
I am indispensable.

- You've been so
stressed lately.

- That's why I get paid the big
bucks, don't you know.

50

somewhere, just the two of us,

- We could support
each other.

- Uh-huh.
- We could open our own
little B & B.

on the block.

Great food, great music,
cute waiters.

- You've got a
great eye, Diane.

Finding the good ones early
is a real gift.

- Excuse me ladies.

- I can see why you and Rand
haven't gotten around to
having kids.

105
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:53,618
- [Diane]: Oh, we're
working on it.

106
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,653
- And who can blame you.

107
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,458
- [Speaking softly]: If I
thought for a second this deal

108
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:02,527
would jeopardize our friendship.
I never would have--

109

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,072
So, can you get me out?

111
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:17,609
- It's a short term investment,
Rand, but it's not that short.

112

- I thought you said
you could get it.
- I said I'd try.

on the company books.

115
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:29,087
When you didn't call me back,
I had to tell my boss.

116
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,522
You know, my ass is really on
the line here, Mitchell.

117

Come on.

running instructions?

119
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:41,099
- Yeah.

120
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,101
Do you got someone
to buy me out?

121
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:46,971
- No, but I can't leave you
hanging out like this.

122
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:50,174
I'm going to cover you out of my
operating account until I find
another investor.

123
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,709
- I so owe you.

00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,712
- Hey, a guaranteed 100% return.
How hard could it be?

125
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,981
The funds will go through now,

126
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:00,485
they'll be waiting there when
the bank opens on Monday.

127
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:03,621
- Thank you.

128
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:07,191

- Yeah, I am better.

- Hmm.
- I am better than better.

131
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,465
- Hmm. Who was that man you were
talking to before?

132
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:17,335
- So.

133
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,771
- Mission accomplished.

134
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:23,207
- Really? Show me.

135
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:27,278
- Well, everything's under
control, so, trust me.

00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:31,249
- Show me.

137
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:37,388
- Hey, you're the boss.

138
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,524
- We'll be right back.

139
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,592
- No people skills.
Even in college.

Back in a flash.

141
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,630
- Thank you.

142
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,135
- I don't see it buddy.
- It's got to be here, okay.

143
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,239
- It's kind of hard to
miss a half million dollar
electronic deposit.

144
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:57,442
- Well, I watched him
make it myself.

145
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,744
He said when the bank opens on
Monday it would be there.

146
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:01,746
- Monday?
Two days from now?

147
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,349
- Yeah.

148
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,384
- You're kidding, right?

149
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,526
- Rand? Honey?

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,663
- Mitchell Thompson, he's about
my age, dark hair.

151
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:21,399
He was driving a Silver Lexus
convertible. Do you know
where he is?

152
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:23,801
- Oh yeah, yeah.
He was parked over there,
but he's long gone.

153
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:26,571
- Where, where?! There?!
- Yeah, right there.

154
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:30,141
- Honey, talk to me.
- He's gone. He's gone.
- Who?

155
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:34,145
- Mitchell.

156
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:37,582
The transfer was not a mistake.
It was...

157
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,685
He was giving himself
a head start.

158
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,754
The weekend.

159
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,756
- What are you
talking about?

160
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,658
- Oh, God.
- Rand?

161
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:51,496
- He called for months with no
charge stock...

162
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:54,165
no charge stock tips.

163
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:58,669
Never once tried to push
anything on me. Infallible.

164
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,671
Checked him out with his
other clients.

165
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:06,411
His rate of return on investment
was... it was amazing.

166
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,846
I trusted him.

167
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,250
You know, he was...
he was my friend.

168
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,219
- I don't understand, Rand.

169
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,688
- He had a once in
a lifetime deal.

170
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,824
I invested a million dollars.

171
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:23,594
- Do we even have that kind
of money?

172
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:27,131

00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:29,339
...just stop whatever we was
doing and just watch.

349
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,341
"That's you, Cerise."

350
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,377
"A blaze of summer glory."

351
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,720
Anyway, my summer glory just
turned 10 last month,

352
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:47,124
it's all I can do to keep her in
clean socks and out of trouble.

353
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:54,464
- Whoa, this can't
be right.

354
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:56,466
- FICA, withholding,
group medical.

355
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,468
Where you been girl?

356
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:00,537
- And we're supposed to live
on what's left?

357
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,606
- Unless you got an offshore tax
shelter somewhere.

358
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,108
See, used to be you could live
of your hourly bank of tips,

359
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,110
but now Uncle Sam takes a piece
of that too.

360
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,112
- But I've got car repairs.

361
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:13,350
- And I got a daughter who needs
a laptop for school.

362
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:16,320
- How do you do it?

363
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,555
- Creativity.

364
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,557
Double coops.

365
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,093
- There you go
darling. Enjoy.

366
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:26,363
Yesterday's special.

367
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,632
Just because the Board of Health
won't let us serve leftovers

368
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:30,767
don't mean they got
to go to waste.

369
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,369
- Deputy.

370
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:35,739
- Nando. When are you going to
start calling me Nando like
everybody else does?

371
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:38,742
- Kind of late to be giving out
parking tickets, Nando.

372
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:42,245
- I just want to make sure
everybody gets home safe, if
that's okay with you.

373
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,283
- Since this is such a
high crime area.

374
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,485
- Listen, new in town does not
mean that a person

375
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:51,288
is not entitled to full
protection under the law.

376
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:55,125
- New in town's just
passing through.

377
00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:59,529
- You know, you stand back far
enough, we're all just passing
through, Dee Dee.

378
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:01,631
Look, let me get
that for you.

379
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:09,339
You know we seem to have gotten
off on the wrong foot
the other day,

380
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,408
and I was just hoping if...

381
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:13,410
maybe we could have
a fresh start?

382
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,846
- You should know that
I'm newly single

383
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,848
and I plan to stay
that way.

384
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,850
- Okay, fair enough.

385
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:24,755
But if you change your mind,
I mean about me seeing
you home sometime.

386
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:26,757
- I'll keep that in mind.

387
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,426
Can I go?

388
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,461
[ She starts up the car ]

389
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:47,511
- Oh hey there. I was about to
think that maybe you'd gone and
left town on us.

390
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:49,379
- We made a deal.

391
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,381
- Oh, it wouldn't be
the first time.

392
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:53,383
- It's not much, but I'll be
back next week.

393
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:55,419
- It all adds up.
Thank you.

394
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,293
- Your beef, sir, and your
barbeque Miss Seagle,

395
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:05,462
with extra sauce,
the way you like it.

396
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:08,532
- Ha-ha. You know the leading
cause of death my friend?

397
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:10,567
Getting out of bed
in the morning.

398
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:17,808
Sign right over there.

399
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:26,416
Thank you very much.
Oh, that's my pen. Thanks.

400
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,321
- Hello? You need to send a cop
to "The Cash Cow" immediately.

401
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:33,523
Yes, it's an emergency.

402
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:36,226
No, no, no. It's immediate...

403
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:39,229
No, no, the man who killed my
husband is sitting in
the restaurant...

404
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,364
No, he didn't exactly...
Could you just...

405
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,400
just send someone.

406
00:26:49,506 --> 00:26:51,808
- Are you sure it was even him?
You said that you never

407
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,611
even met the men, just saw him
once at a party.

408
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:56,613
How long ago was that?

409
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:59,883
- Sir, my husband is dead
because of him.

410
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,385
I know what he looks like.

411
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:05,222
- I'm sorry for
your loss, m'am,

412
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:07,491
but Midland County's got enough
on its plate without trying

413
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:10,627
to clean up after some
jurisdiction halfway
across country.

414
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,729
Now, if there was an
outstanding warrant...

415
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:15,232
- He disappeared before we could
file charges against him.

416
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:18,235
As I said before, his name may
not even be Mitchell Thompson,
but he's here.

417
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,237
There must be something
you can do.

418
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,372
- Our hands are pretty
much tied.

419
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:25,308
Without a name, there's really
nothing we can do.

420
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:27,644
If we were talking
Enron here, sure.

421
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:29,679
But we're not.

422
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,715
[ Sigh ]

423
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,588
[ Clunk ]

424
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:56,573
- Your iced tea.
- Perfect, thank you darling.

425
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:58,575
- Had a chance to
look at your--

426
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:00,844
- Menu? What's good today.

427
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:04,481
- Well, we're famous
for our ribs.

428
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:06,516
It brings in the
City Hall crowd.

429
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,889
- Well, ribs it is.

430
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,474
- Top it off with a slice of our
homemade apple pie.

431
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:33,476
A scoop of French vanilla?

432
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,512
- You working on commission,
Dee Dee...

433
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,581
- Martin.
Dee Dee Martin.

434
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:41,618
- Dee Dee Martin from Casey, Mo.

435
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:44,387
Your customers must all be the
size of Volkswagens.

436
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:46,623
- Wholesome food and
friendly service.

437
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:48,825
We leave the calorie counting to
Richard Simmons.

438
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:51,828

bean counting,

439
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:53,830
I'm your guy.

440
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:56,800
Mark Taylor, estate planning,
asset management.

441
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,637
I make money for people.
Usually a lot of money.

442
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,639
- Mark Taylor.

443
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,674
Well you need to, just to
afford these.

444
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,810
- I'm a certified
investment counsellor.

445
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:08,812
Do you know anybody
in the market?

446
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:11,381
- And I'll be passing this along
out of the goodness
of my heart?

447
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:13,950
- Referral fee.
The goodness of my heart.

448
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:16,419
- Ah, the profit motive.

449
00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:18,421
- What made this
country great.

450
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:21,958
- And here I thought it was
honesty, hard work, fair play.

451
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,994
- That too.

452
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:28,565
You don't sound like you're
from around here.

453
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:30,400
- Neither do you.

454
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:32,602
- New in town. I'll tell you my
story if you tell me yours.

455
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:35,572
- Some other time.
- How about tonight?

456
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,574
- I really don't think so.

457
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:39,643
- Hey, what happened to that
friendly service?

458
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:44,080
Come on, we could trade
life stories over some
real food.

459
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:46,549
- This is real food.

460
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,718
If that'll be all.

461
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:50,820
- Why not have somebody wait
on you for a change?

462
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,089
- Really?

463
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:54,958
- Really.

464
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,960
I won't bite, if that's what
you're afraid of.

465
00:29:56,993 --> 00:30:01,364
- A gentleman never bites.

466
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,600
We'll go for drinks anyway.

467
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:08,004

Carmen's? 9-ish?

469
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:13,143
- 8-ish.

- 8-ish.

471
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,653
- Big tipper.

472

00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:31,027
- Hey, what's up?

474
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,129
We pretty much got the place
to ourselves.

475
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:35,131
- And I'm on break.

476
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:38,468
- Oh, what?
No pie and coffee?

477
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,537
- How'd you like that
coffee to go?

478
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,607
- This guy really put you
through the ringer, huh?

479
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:48,545
- Not exactly the best
6 months of my life.

480
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:50,780
- Well, look.

481
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:53,149
The good news is
he doesn't remember you.

482
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:56,086
- Well, I never
really met him

483
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,422
and he certainly doesn't know
Dee Dee Martin.

484
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:02,759
Martin's my maiden name.

485
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,761
It's what I gave him.

486
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:07,797
- You know, a guy like that,
it's just business.

487
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:11,701
He's working your husband and
you're just background.

488
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:14,537
Wallpaper. Anyways,
look, 6 months,

489
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:17,507
1,500 miles later he lands
in your lap.

490
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,510
- You know, when I saw him
just sitting there,

491
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:23,646
I didn't know what to do.
I just wanted to...

492
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,715
- You've got his name, his
number, his address.

493
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:27,717
I mean, you've got
a dinner date.

494
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:30,019
- I just wanted to keep him
talking. I thought maybe drinks,

495
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,956
I could get him to tell me
some more, or...

496
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,525
- You did good, Dee Dee...

497
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:37,427
Diane.

498
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:45,568
How about I go pay Mr. Taylor
a little visit.

499
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:47,704
You know, put the fear
of God in him?

500
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:51,141
- He'll just run.

501
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:54,010
- Yeah, he would just run.

502
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:58,047
Print up some more business
cards, start someplace
else in a week.

503
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:02,685
- I feel like I'm at the bottom
of a pit, you know,

504
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:06,122
and up above there is
fresh air and sunlight,

505
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:09,092
people living their lives,
and him.

506
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,261
- And you want out
of that pit.

507
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:13,797
- No...

508
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,865
I want him in it.

509
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:26,843
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hey. Wow.

510
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:30,113
Have you been waiting long?
- No, that's

511
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:32,248
the thing about owning a
company. If I don't do it...

512
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:34,951
- It doesn't get done.

513
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:37,987
Wow, amazing view.

514
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,523
- Tell me. You clean up nice.

515
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:42,725
- I could say the same
thing about you.

516
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,263
- No, really. You belong in West
Texas about as much as I do.

517
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,265
- So, what are we both
doing here then?

518
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:52,735
- Making money,
lots of it.

519
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,737
- I'm glad one of us is.

520
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:58,141
- Me too. What a waste.

521
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:02,679
- What's a nice girl like me
doing working in "The Cash Cow"?

522
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:04,047
- Yeah.

523
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,950
College? Husband?

524
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:10,253
- Let's just say sometimes
things just don't work out
the way you planned.

525
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:13,156
- Did thing work out the
way he planned?

526
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:16,259
- He's no longer in the picture.

527
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:19,963
- That's it? That's
all I get?

528
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:23,032
No sad tale of marital meltdown,

529
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,902
no who's been sleeping
in my bed?

530
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:28,137
- Sorry. Just me,

531
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,640
starting over.

532
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:33,643
- All right then.

533
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:35,678
To starting over.

534
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:40,984
- My turn.

535
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,920
Why Midland, Texas?

536
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:47,323
- Why not?

537
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:50,960
Ranchers and oil barons, they
need investment counselling too.

538
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:56,633
But developing a client
base: Cold calls,

539
00:33:56,666 --> 00:34:00,169
seminars, get-acquainted
cocktail parties.

540
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:03,072
- It sounds very social.

541
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:08,378
- All I ever meet are middle
aged business prospects and
myself coming and going.

542
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:10,947
- You must have help, you know,
in your office.

543
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,283
People doing things to...
- What?

544
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,085
A little secretary with a
bible belt diploma

545
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,721
and a dress size to
pick out for her?

546
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:22,792
No, I need somebody who
can carry on

547
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:25,061
an actual conversation,
make an impression.

548
00:34:25,094 --> 00:34:28,965
- It's mostly evenings?
- Yeah, it's odd hours.

549
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:33,069
Too much to be part-time,
not enough to be full-time.
- I'm usually finished

550
00:34:33,102 --> 00:34:36,306
by the afternoons.

551
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:40,376
I have been known to carry on
an actual conversation,
now and then.

552
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:44,814
- You'd be interested? Really?

553
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:47,717
- It depends.
- On what?

554
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,252
- The pay.

555
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:52,655
- Ah-ha, the profit motive.

556
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:58,061
- Of course, it's what made this
country great, or so I'm told.

557
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:03,366
- Well, I'll think
about it.

558
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:07,403
Maybe once we get to know
each other better.

559
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:14,043
- Isn't that what we're
doing right now?

560
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:19,048
- The good news is the market
always come back.

561
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:22,285
Long term, they offer the
highest return.

562
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:25,154
Better than bonds,
gold, commodities

563
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:27,824
and even better than
real estate.

564
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:32,295
Now, the really good news is
that these historic lows

565
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:36,699
offer us a once in a lifetime
opportunity to buy into

566
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,868
a highly discounted market,

567
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:41,771
positioning the smart investor

568
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:44,307
to make amazing gains when
it takes off again.

569
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,711
If you know what to buy.

570
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:52,181
LBOs, IPOs, small caps,

571
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:54,951
large caps, foreign or
emerging markets.

572
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:58,121
It's enough to make
your head spin.

573
00:35:58,154 --> 00:36:01,824
Which of course is
where I come in.

574

Everybody,

00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,097
this is Dee,
my research associate.

576
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:11,300
Dee helps me track market
trends, separate the winners

577
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:14,971
from the world coms. Smile
for the people, Dee.

578
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,476
Thank you sir, thank
you for coming.

579
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,513
Do you guys have one
of my cards?

580
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:26,115
If you have any questions, any
at all, please feel free
to call.

581
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:28,317
I also have a website.

582
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:36,225
- Wow.

583
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:41,064
Research associate.

584
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:45,401
- Moonlighting waitress might
not set quite the right tone.

585
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:51,007
- And I help separate the
winners from the world coms,

586
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,444
how exactly?
- Not yet, but you will.

587
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:59,515
I'll show you how to download
this stuff off a dozen websites.

588
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,784
There's nothing to it.

589
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:09,425
- [Tape recording]: But you
will, I'll show you how to
download this stuff off

590
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:12,095
a dozen websites. There's
nothing to it.

591
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:17,366
- It's not exactly a
confession, is it?

592
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,535
- Did you think you were going
to hit the bulls eye first
time out?

593
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:23,506
Look, just keep him talking,
let Memorex do the rest.

594
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:25,541
- Am I close enough?

595
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,577
- To what, get a signal?

596
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,946
- Yeah.
- Let me worry
about those things.

597
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:33,416
Just keep doing what you're
doing, give it a little
more time.

598
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:36,119
- Time. He could be
gone tomorrow.

599
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,454
- Nah, not when
the money's coming in.

600
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,361
- I appreciate this.

601
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,363
- It's our little
secret, okay?

602
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:51,434
Besides, the department doesn't
know we're using their gear.

603
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:54,303
- You don't take
credit for this?
- For what?

604
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,572
Going behind
Wallace's back?

605
00:37:56,606 --> 00:38:00,042
Uh, warrentless surveillance,
misuse of government property.

606
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:04,280
This isn't about due
process, Diane.

607
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:09,285
- What have you got?
Corporate tax cuts?

608
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,587
And you, sir.

609
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:15,391
The equity in your home, if you
sell it where are you
going to live?

The Social Security benefit
that seems to get

smaller and farther
away every year.

thing you should always ask
your investment counsellor?

00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:40,583
What have you done for
me lately?

617
00:38:40,616 --> 00:38:45,454
Well tonight, we have your
quarterly distribution cheques,

00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:48,457
and for those of you rolling
over your profits,

619
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:51,894
quarterly earning statements
detailing the returns

00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:54,597
you're earning on your returns.

621
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,000
And for you first timers--
- Mr. Klein Schmidt.
- ...and opportunity,

622
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:03,339
a chance to profit from your
neighbour's experience.

623
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:07,543
- That seemed to go well.

624
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:11,414
- Practically a
feeding frenzy.

625
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:16,319
Even in this economy you make is
seem so easy, so right.

626
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:18,221
- Well, that is the idea.

627
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:27,029
- But retirement money, their
kids' college funds.
- And your point?

628
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:30,099
- Have you thought about what
would happen if they don't turn

629
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:32,301
a profit, if they can't get
their money back?

- Have they?

631
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:36,339
- Do you always answer a
question with a question?

632
00:39:36,372 --> 00:39:37,607
- Do you?

mind, Dee?

- Can we go to jail
for this, Mark?

638
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:01,297
- For what?
- What we're doing.

Impossible? You've seen

00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:19,148
It just...

645
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,652
It all seems a little bit too
good to be true.

646
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:28,591
- Well, if it's too good
to be true,

647
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,993
you're dealing with
an amateur.

648

But if it's too good
to pass up,

You don't really have to
produce anything.

enough, nobody even bothers to
read the label.

The sizzle, not the steak.

selling. Sizzle.

he just loves that pay hike,

finishes his scam.

play detective.

sheriff with this.

tape fiasco?

lot more than this.

01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:21,228
but this guy gets cold
feet overnight.

1190
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,799
Look I don't...

1191
01:18:25,832 --> 01:18:27,935
What if... What if Dee
went with you?

1192
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:30,304
- What? Instead?

1193
01:18:30,337 --> 01:18:32,472
- Well, I know it's a lot to ask
but she is my partner

1194
01:18:32,506 --> 01:18:34,474
and you already
have a ticket.

1195
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:35,943
- That I do.

1196
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:41,615
- Besides, the important thing
is what's in here:

1197
01:18:41,648 --> 01:18:47,287
750K of pure profit.

1198
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:50,057
- Well, it beats cancelling,

1199
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:53,827
again and she is
your partner.

1200
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,697
- Silent partner.
Mark, I am really--

1201
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,699
- I'm sorry, Dee,

1202
01:18:58,732 --> 01:19:00,901
but stuff happens and
we're a team right.

1203
01:19:00,934 --> 01:19:04,371
Just show the flag, I'll do the
heavy lifting the next trip.

1204
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:07,507
Here, get whatever you
need in Chicago,

1205
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:11,378
I'll take care of anything else
when you get back.

1206
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:14,047
- Thanks, partner.

1207
01:19:14,081 --> 01:19:16,049
- [Announcer]: This is a 1st
boarding call

1208
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:19,486
for Pan Western flight
308 to Chicago.

1209
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:22,656
- Here's to our flight.
- [Cerise]: You call this
a drink?!

1210
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:26,860
I ordered a Bloody Mary, not
some cheap ass Shirley Temple!
Where's the manager?! Now!

1211
01:19:26,893 --> 01:19:29,830
- All in good time, Dee.
All in good time.

1212
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,502
[ Laughter ]
- They let anybody fly today.

1213
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:47,080
- You know, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to use the ladies room.

1214
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:49,750
- Don't be long.

1215
01:19:55,789 --> 01:19:59,426
- I guess I don't need to tell
you what would have happened

1216
01:19:59,459 --> 01:20:01,595
if we had had a problem with
that money? Huh?

1217
01:20:01,628 --> 01:20:03,597
After two false starts.

1218
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:08,535
Well, these Chicago guys, they
have this reputation

1219
01:20:08,568 --> 01:20:11,505
for shooting the
messenger. Literally.

1220
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:13,974
- Clockwork, Chason.

1221
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:17,944
Trust me, it's all going
like clockwork.

1222
01:20:17,978 --> 01:20:21,948
- Tick-tock.

1223
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,663
Vanity thy name is woman.

1224
01:20:36,697 --> 01:20:39,700
[ Phone ringing ]

1225
01:20:41,034 --> 01:20:43,637
Here, darling.

1226
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:55,615
Go on.

1227
01:20:55,649 --> 01:20:59,386
Go on and tell moneybags
Garfield you're going to
come hold his hand.

1228
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:04,591
Uh-uh.

1229
01:21:08,161 --> 01:21:09,663
Not that I don't
trust you.

1230
01:21:17,604 --> 01:21:19,940
- I'll call you back.

1231
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:51,204
What?
- [Nando]: Hey, we've

1232
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:53,240
got a big problem.
- You're telling me.

1233
01:21:53,273 --> 01:21:55,542
I'll get back to you
when I find her.

1234
01:21:55,575 --> 01:21:58,578
- [Nando]: Okay, there's no
time. We're just outside.

1235
01:22:02,282 --> 01:22:04,151
Women.

1236
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:06,753
- Did you round her up? We've
got to make tracks.

1237
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:08,889
- Dee's not feeling
well, Chason.

1238
01:22:08,922 --> 01:22:11,691
On second thought, I'm going to
join you in Chicago.

1239
01:22:11,725 --> 01:22:13,460
- Well, there you go.

1240
01:22:15,262 --> 01:22:16,963
- Detective Dwight
Wallace,

1241
01:22:16,997 --> 01:22:19,232
Midland County Sherrif's
Department. We got a call

1242
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:21,201
about a suspicious package.

1243
01:22:21,234 --> 01:22:24,504
- Well, we're just having a
drink waiting for our flight.

1244
01:22:24,538 --> 01:22:26,873
- Then you won't mind showing
what's in the briefcase.

1245
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:33,613
Under the table.
- Detective,

1246
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:39,152
I think you need a warrant
don't you?

1247
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:42,189
- You want to dot the Is and
cross the Ts, we gotta
go downtown,

1248
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:46,760
find a judge. You'll miss your
flight. It's up to you.

1249
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:48,795
- It's all right, Chase.

1250
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,142
Satisfied?

1251
01:23:02,175 --> 01:23:06,046
- Now the other one.

1252
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,183
- Other one? What other one?

1253
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:20,293
- Nothing suspicious
here detective,

1254
01:23:20,327 --> 01:23:23,263
just good old American...

1255
01:23:27,234 --> 01:23:29,936
paperwork.

1256
01:23:35,675 --> 01:23:39,212
- See, that's the problem with
anonymous phonecalls, sir.

1257
01:23:39,246 --> 01:23:42,249
- Are we done here?

1258
01:23:42,282 --> 01:23:45,252
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

1259
01:23:45,285 --> 01:23:47,787
You gentlemen have a
good flight.

1260
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:49,656
- After we've had a closer
look at the goods.

1261
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:51,091
Paige Seagle, Midland
County, DA.

1262
01:23:51,124 --> 01:23:54,594
- A closer look? What exactly
are you looking for?

1263
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:57,998
- Financial records. An
unlicensed investment fund.

1264
01:23:58,031 --> 01:24:00,033
Possible ponzi scheme.

1265
01:24:00,066 --> 01:24:02,035
- Ponzi scheme.

1266
01:24:02,068 --> 01:24:04,237
You slimey son of a bitch.

1267
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:06,006
I'll break your skull!
- Get him off me!

1268
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:08,341
- We'll be taking those
into custody.

1269
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:11,244
- Wait, wait, you
can't just come in here and
start seizing private papers.

1270
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:16,116
- Exigent circumstances. You can
debate the fine points at
your arraingment.

1271
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:19,386
- You're a dead man, Taylor!
You hear me?! Dead!

1272
01:24:19,419 --> 01:24:22,122
- Nando. Nando.

1273
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:23,924
- I don't know you pal.

1274
01:24:23,957 --> 01:24:26,293
- Wait a minute.

1275
01:24:28,662 --> 01:24:30,797
Nice phone. You mind?

1276
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:33,066
- Would it matter if I did?

1277
01:24:33,099 --> 01:24:35,101
- No.

1278
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:44,911
- Listent... listen to me. It's
probably some kind of cell
phone glitch.

1279
01:24:44,945 --> 01:24:47,781
You know, I've had trouble with
that phone. It goes off,
wrong number.

1280
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:50,817
Who put that there? That's
not my case.

1281
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,953
- Then you won't mind
if we open it.
- Come on.

1282
01:24:55,055 --> 01:24:58,325
- Okay, Dwight,
this is a set up.
- How did she know this?

1283
01:24:58,358 --> 01:25:02,062
You set me up! You set me up you
son of a-- Where is she?!

1284
01:25:02,095 --> 01:25:03,363
Where the hell is she?!

1285
01:25:03,396 --> 01:25:05,365
- Your personal
identification number,

1286
01:25:05,398 --> 01:25:07,000
up to 10 letters
and numbers.

1287
01:25:07,033 --> 01:25:08,902
- Yes.

1288
01:25:08,935 --> 01:25:10,837
The pin is "seed money",

1289
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,207
not that you'll need it
with a court order.

1290
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:19,746
Safe deposit box #1056.

1291
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:22,382
- How do you know so
much about this?

1292
01:25:22,415 --> 01:25:26,753
- He told me. Little by
little, everything.

1293
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:32,993
- And all those
identical briefcases?

1294
01:25:33,026 --> 01:25:34,995
- [Dee on speakerphone]: He
loved the audience.

1295
01:25:35,028 --> 01:25:37,897
Someone to appreciate
how smart he was.

1296
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:42,135
I just listened. I had
some help.

1297
01:25:42,168 --> 01:25:44,804
Here's to our flight.

1298
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:46,806
- You call this
a drink?!

1299
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,878
I ordered a Bloody Mary, not
some cheap ass Shirley Temple!

1300
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:54,114
Where's the manager.
I want to see the manager now!

1301
01:25:54,147 --> 01:25:57,117
- All in good time, Dee.
All in good time.

1302
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,052
- They'll let anybody fly today.

1303
01:25:59,085 --> 01:26:01,855
- Excuse me, I'd like to
use the ladies room.

1304
01:26:01,888 --> 01:26:05,058
- Don't be long.

1305
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:07,293
- Those financial records,
all the people

1306
01:26:07,327 --> 01:26:10,196
he's been defrauding here. Where
did they come from?

1307
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:13,266
- One man's trash is another
man's treasure.

1308
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:17,804
- I could offer you immunity
from prosecution for
your testimony.

1309
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:20,707
- You've got all the
evidence you need.

1310
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,352
- A dozen aliases,

1311
01:26:32,385 --> 01:26:37,323
hundreds of victims. Millions in
fraud, maybe so, but still.

1312
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:39,526
- All I want is restitution.

1313
01:26:39,559 --> 01:26:41,528
- Sometimes I wonder if there

1314
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:43,997
really is such a thing.

1315
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:47,233
- You never get your life back.

1316
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,869
But there are compensations.

1317
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:53,039
- Wow.

1318
01:26:59,145 --> 01:27:00,847
- If you hadn't of called
here that night.

1319
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,816
How did you get my private
number anyway?

1320
01:27:02,849 --> 01:27:05,351
- You gave it to me.
- I did?

1321
01:27:05,385 --> 01:27:08,221
I know you?
- I wouldn't expect

1322
01:27:08,254 --> 01:27:11,091
you to remember.
- What are you,

1323
01:27:11,124 --> 01:27:14,127
some kind of
ponzi scheme vigilante?

1324
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,197
- Miss Seagle, I did what
I had to do.

1325
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:20,967
- You were one of his victims.
- Not anymore.

1326
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,303
- What did he do to you?
What did he take?

1327
01:27:23,336 --> 01:27:27,240
- More than you could possibly
imagine. But that's the past.

1328
01:27:27,273 --> 01:27:29,375
- I could be having this call
traced you know.

1329
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:32,779
- And I could be on a cell phone
right down the street.

1330
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:41,521
Or I could have Texas in my
rear view mirror.
