10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,907

favor though?

Oh, I can understand that

Thank you Ray

150
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,950
I can handle it from here

151
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,040
Well...

152
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,476
You know, you may have gotten away
with this sort of behavoir in

153
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,112
the New York City school system

154
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,517
but I can assure you that we will
not tolerate it here at Mayfield

155
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,918
Look Mr. Vogel I didn't...

156
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,120
But Mr. Vogel nothing

157
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:42,591
Mr. Slater, you've already gotten
off on the wrong foot here

158
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,926
and I can further assure you that

159
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,228
if you do not straighten up
and fly right

160
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:50,699
the only school that you will be
attending will be reform school

161
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,769
Sir I'm really not a bad guy
once you get to know me

162
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,472
Look, it's obvious I've been
framed for something I didn't do

163
00:14:56,496 --> 00:15:01,944
Ah, yes, that is just what the
owner of this said

164
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,380
And he is now doing, oh let's see

165
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,551
5 to 7 years
in the state penitentiary

166
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,600
thanks to my diligence

167
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,556
Sir, you got me all wrong

168
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,724
All right. have it your way

169
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,260
Perhaps a little detention will
give you the opportunity to

170
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,763
consider your future here
at Mayfield

171
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,532
Let's say 3 weeks

172
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,168
3 weeks, for what?

173
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:32,041
You know, you're right
let's make it 4 weeks

174
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,042
But Mr. Vogel I...

175
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,058
One more word and it could be five

176
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,673
What the hell is...

177
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,747

00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,414
Take it inside
Round up the strays

185
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,701
We're here for a while

186
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,208
What do you people think
you are doing here?

187
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,077
Anything we want

188
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,347
My god. Are you the proprietor of
this establishment?

189
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,617
Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me

190
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,251
I asked you a question

191
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,921
Yes, I'm the principal

192
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,923
Good, looks like we'll be here for
a while and we require

193
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,257
some hospitality

194
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,359
What do you want?

195
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,661
What we need is cooperation
and that means

196
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,996
you only speak when
you are spoken to

197
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,545
Now turn around and walk

198
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:11,081
I'll get Boomer

199
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,256
Quickly

200
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:57,680
Attention all students, faculty
and personnel still in the building

201
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,402
Please report at once to
the assembly hall

202
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,055
This is an emergency

203
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,427
Please everyone go to
the assembly hall

204
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,885
This is not a drill

205
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,031
Now the police

206
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,735
Tell them to keep their distance
or we start throwing out corpses

207
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,955
Young teenage corpses

208
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,050
Hey Stacy, what do you say we
hang out here for a little while?

209
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,351
But they said it was an emergency

210
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,320
It's probably just a fire drill
or something

211
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,421
I don't know

212
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,057
Oh come on, I'll protect you

213
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,059
Oh yeah, and who's going to
protect me from you

214
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,294
Me?
Yeah

215
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,529
If you can't trust me
who can you trust?

216
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,231
Stacy, come on

217
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,132
I'll meet you there

218
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,988
Yeah, come on Betty
you and me babe

219
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,226
Cool

220
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,213
Just stay calm Mr. Vogel

221
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,481
we'll get you out of this mess
all right

222
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,249
Give them whatever they want

223
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,084
Ok

224
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,086
They won't release their demands
until the FBI gets here

225
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,388
Get me a perimeter set up
I want a SWAT team

226
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,525
Get me fire department
bomb squad, EMS

227
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,392
What about the press?

228
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,395
No, no, leave them out of this
till we know more ourselves

229
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,498
ls your boy still in there?

230
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,734
Not likely no
not after school hours

231
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,969
Jesus

232
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,037
I thought this is where you come
to get rid of this kind of crap

233
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,426
in your life

234
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,045
Guys, guys, hey listen to me

235
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,213
Don't go near the assembly hall
all right?

236
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,715
You got to help me to get everyone
together and get them

237
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,682
out of the building

238
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,750
Eat shit dirtbag

239
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,352
Listen to me man

240
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,554
We still ain't finished with you
city boy

241
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,989
Fine, fine, let's go outside

242
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,557
I'll let you kick my ass
all you want

243
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,459
Just let's do it outside huh?

244
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,780
You woos

245
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,453
Faggot

246
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,301
Let's go boys and girls
to the assembly hall

247
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,637
Let's cut come on, let's cut
All right, all right

248
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,857
Come on, we haven't got all day

249
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,134
Let's go

250
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,289
Hey man, something bad is cooking

251
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,630
Sit

252
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,655
Boomer, phase one

253
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,908
Yes sir

254
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,708
Check for stragglers

255
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,841
Now that I have your attention

256
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:50,312
You all have the great opportunity
today to be a part of history

257
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,847
in the making

258
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,250
Now you can either sit back and
enjoy it

259
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,252
or watch it face down in a pool
of your own blood

260
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,641
It's your choice

261
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,947
Makes no difference to me

262
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,037
Damn

263
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,086
I shouldn't have bought that
second milk

264
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,203
Who was that?

265
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,305
Who cares, they're gone now

266
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,906
Come on Eddy
let's get out of here

267
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,641
The girls are going to be
wondering where I'm at

268
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,943
Then let them wonder

269
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,645
You know I do have a reputation
to think of here

270
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,315
Yeah, so do I

271
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,151
Wait, did you here that?

272
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,619
Sounds like sirens, listen

273
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,421
Will you come on

274
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,810
Listen

275
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,011
Chief Slater

276
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,280
What options are you taking
to apprehend the terrorist?

277
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,249
We're considering all our options

278
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,383
What about the hostages?

279
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,718
That's our priority

280
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,387
Is it true the terrorists have
possession of the new top secret

281
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,588
missile guidance system?

282
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,791
Yes, I'm sure they have the
atomic bomb too

283
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,826
Now please, just let us
do our jobs okay?

284
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,095
The warehouse at Greenville
we've got reports that

285
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,130
that's where it was stored

286
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,565
Do you?
Chief is it true

287
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,633
you were one of
the officers

288
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,901
in the
World Trade Center bombing?

289
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,002
That's a matter of record

290
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,553
Is it also true that your son is
a student here?

291
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,042
Well, if it isn't Leonard

292
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,423
Guys, you've got to get out of
here right now

293
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,724
So it was you in the locker room
wasn't it?

294
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,693
Hey me and you got some unfinished
business Broncs boy

295
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,929
I told you, my dad told me
not to fight girls

296
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,263
You son of a bitch

297
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,398
Aiming problem again eh?

298
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,566
That's it man

299
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,201
That is it. You are dead

300
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,669
Do me a favor will you
chill your boyfriend out all right?

301
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,170
We've got to do something to get
out of here right now

302
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,139
Hey, you're not getting out of it
this time city boy

303
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,774
He's not my boyfriend
Forget that all right

304
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,242
We've just got to get out of here

305
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,477
Wait, wait
what are you talking about?

306
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,744
What am I talking about?

307
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,380
I'm talking about a half dozen
heavily armed dudes who blew away

308
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,716
a cop and that sorry ass security
guard Ray

309
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,751
I'm also talking about some bitch
they got with them

310
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,553
Some crazy bitch who almost blew
my head off when I was

311
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,389
in Vogel's office taking the rap
for your boyfriend's little

312
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,657
peeping Tom stunt

313
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,458
That was you?

314
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:24,359
I don't know what
he's talking about

315
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,494
You son of a bitch

316
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,161
Forget that now

317
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,262
We just got to get out of here

318
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,697
Hey, hey, wait a minute

319
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,932
I'm not going anywhere till I know
what the hell's going on

320
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,267
What, you don't trust me?

321
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,135
No

322
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,970
Yeah, well then I dare you
to follow me

323
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:35,237
Come on

324
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:35,904
Come on tough guy

325
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,555
All right fine, let's go

326
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,704
I want snipers on the rooftops
there, there and there

327
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,573
Tell them to report any movement

328
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,909
My men can pick of anything
within 500 yards

329
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,545
Well that's all we need
dead bodies in the school yard

330
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,447
I don't want heroes Hawkins
I want hostages all right?

331
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,782
Shooters are a last resort

332
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,883
Whatever you say chief

333
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:22,717
Any word?

334
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,485
Nothing

335
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,419
Want me to call the feds again?

336
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,411
Yeah, find out what's keeping them

337
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,057
Well except for the
Empire State Building

338
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,992
I'd swear I was back in New York

339
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,008
Chaos, potential for bloodshed

340
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,022
At least there I can
get a good cup of coffee

341
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,403
Yes?

342
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,940
Excuse me sir
I have to go to the bathroom

343
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:07,829
Wait

344
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,364
You have to make some kind
of arrangement for them

345
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,719
Shut up

346
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,934
Number one or number two?

347
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,426
Number one

348
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,356
You may go in the corner

349
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,347
That's the last of them

350
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,848
Boomer

351
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,749
Yes sir

352
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,084
Phase two

353
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,303
Yes sir

354
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,785
Shit, you're right

355
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,221
It looks like they've got some
kind of bomb or something

356
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,822
Whatever it is it ain't good

357
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,158
What now genius?

358
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,294
You just get out of here
while you got a chance

359
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:13,295
What about you?

360
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,030
There's a gun in Vogel's office

361
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,131
What are you crazy?

362
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,399
Those dudes have machine guns

363
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,333
I can see that guy

364
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,801
I think we should call
the police guys

365
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:20,669
That's a good idea

366
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:21,336
A really good idea

367
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,138
Chances are they're probably in
the dark about what's going on

368
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:23,805
in here

369
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:24,639
You're nuts

370
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,141
I'm getting the hell out of here

371
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,809
You go ahead if you want to

372
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,244
I want to help

373
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,712
Fine come help

374
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,580
Wait, wait, wait
what is with you people?

375
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,594
Come on

376
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,442
FBI will be here soon

377
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:41,911
Good

378
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,644
He put it in a desk or drawer
somewhere

379
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,297
Call 9110k?

380
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,532
Shit

381
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:54,936
What?
The bastard left the mike on

382
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,121
I'll get him

383
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,206
Shut up

384
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,053
Speak

385
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,223
This is police chief Slater
I have FBI agents

386
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:48,723
Doogan

387
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,158
Doogan and

388
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:50,525
Du mford

389
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,359
Du mford

390
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,594
Put them on

391
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:55,029
This is special agent Doogan FBI

392
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,099
Ah, a woman, I like that

393
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,434
You're very perceptive

394
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,402
Who am I talking to?

395
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,404
That's unimportant

396
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:05,440
What is important is that you call
your men out of this building

397
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,609
or I start throwing dead teenagers
out the window on time for

398
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,444
the six o'clock news

399
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,845
You got anybody in there?

400
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,166
No, of course not

401
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,283
We don't have anyone in there

402
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,651
You wouldn't lie to me would you?

403
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,720
You got anybody
pulling a cowboy act?

404
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,489
My men follow my orders
I follow yours

405
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,524
We have no one in there

406
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,725
I give you my word

407
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,761
Very well, I guess I'll just have
to take care of it on my end

408
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,196
Now don't do anything rash

409
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,831
We're here to make a deal

410
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,699
What the hell is it you want?

411
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,803
0k, listen closely, because I'm
only going to say it once

412
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:37,705
We are in possession of enough
explosives to level this entire

413
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,874
building and everyone in it

414
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,643
I get the picture

415
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,111
Get to the point

416
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:46,981
Right now they are strategically
placed and armed for maximum impact

417
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,316
We have several hostages

418
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,319
Just imagine what they would look
like if we were to detonate

419
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,720
I couldn't agree with you more

420
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,055
Now what do we do about it?

421
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,390
Oh, it's very simple

422
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,693
First we require the
federal government to completely

423
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:02,864
disband and dissolve all its
military, law enforcement and

424
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,332
bureaucratic agencies

425
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:08,670
Second, all assets and arms
in possession of these agencies

426
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,873
shall be turned over to our cause
the Free Peoples Militia

427
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,742
for distribution to their
rightful owners

428
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,495
namely the American tax payers

429
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,961
We have a loony on our hands

430
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,715
You can't be serious

431
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,418
Does the term dead serious
ring a bell?

432
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,520
Now I suggest you get started

433
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,223
You have 2 hours or you're going
to be sifting through debris

434
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,191
scattered over a 3 mile radius

435
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,193
Oh and don't try anything foolish

436
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:35,330
The slightest sign of aggression
and I will automatically detonate

437
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,118
without further discussion

438
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,969
Wait, hello, hello

439
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:42,461
Damn

440
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,140
Anybody seen what
they took in there?

441
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,076
The rumor is they have
a big crate

442
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,711
Four of them carried it in

443
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,362
It's big enough

444
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,139
If you have any bright ideas
now would be a good time

445
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,395
How long to break the code?

446
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,565
Well, it's more sophisticated
than I thought

447
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,700
2, maybe 3 hours

448
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,386
You got 2, make it work

449
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,507
There's still some strays
wandering the halls

450
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,808
I want them found

451
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,958
Now

452
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,402
Come on

453
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,214
Shit

454
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,526
That's it man

455
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,227
That is it

456
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,328
I'm out of here

457
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,129
Let's go

458
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,497
He's right

459
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,332
How far do you guys think
you're gonna get huh?

460
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,867
I've seen these guys shoot ok

461
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,268
They don't miss

462
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,886
And what do you think you're
gonna do? Stop them?

463
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,840
Shit

464
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,875
Great

465
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,744
Broncs boy here is gonna fight
them off with an empty gun

466
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,446
Let me tell you something
loud mouth all right

467
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,548
It doesn't take much to get in to
fights in the Broncs

468
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:04,118
The real talent comes from getting
out of fights with a good bluff ok?

469
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:04,752
I don't know guys

470
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,820
What are we gonna do?

471
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,175
What are we gonna do?

472
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,625
0k, just chill ok, relax

473
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,127
Just get back in the can
stay there and be quiet

474
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,329
Look I might be scared
but I'm not gonna

475
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,843
go hide in the bathroom

476
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,333
All right fine

477
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:18,700
What about you?

478
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,715
What are you gonna do?

479
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:25,859
0k, what's your plan asshole?

480
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:27,688
Follow me

481
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,717
There's someone else, find him

482
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,799
You got it

483
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:40,970
They bought it

484
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:43,925
And Boomer?

485
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,259
He's got 2 hours

486
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,512
He better figure it out

487
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,087
He's supposed to be the best

488
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,950
He'd better be

489
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,344
Hey, I tell you man
we searched the whole school

490
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,680
Yeah, but we're not going back
till we check it twice

491
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,616
Listen, we can do this a lot
better if we split up

492
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,817
That's a good idea

493
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,219
Why don't you take this floor

494
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,087
You take the basement
I'll take the first floor ok?

495
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,408
Let's go.
Got you

496
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,868
Dude, what are you doing?
That's gas

497
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,504
I know just let me show you
Just help me

498
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,040
Are you crazy man.
Come on, just do he says.

499
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:34,158
Let's go
Stacy, get those, get those

500
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:38,294
Let's go...

501
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:40,848
Come on man

502
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,271
Stacy get in here, get in here

503
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,152
Let's go

504
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:44,585
Come on

505
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,542
Let's go

506
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,591
Eddy man, you got a cigarette?

507
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,025
Why?

508
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,260
Just give me one

509
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,394
Come on, hurry up, give him one

510
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,495
Come on
All right, all right

511
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,129
Got a light?

512
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,397
Would you like me to smoke
it for you too?

513
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,786
Just give me a light man

514
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,638
I want every call going in and
out of that building monitored

515
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,639
right through here

516
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,607
And get me the local utility
company and the lines

517
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,576
Cut off the electricity pronto

518
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,510
Got it

519
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,379
How good are your sharp shooters?

520
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,580
That's taking a chance

521
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,481
Ok

522
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,349
You cut their power
flush them outwith tear gas

523
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,933
and cut them off one by one
as they come out the door

524
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,354
Outstanding ma'am

525
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,924
W0, wo, wo, Miss Doogan

526
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,926
It's Agent Doogan

527
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,227
Yes, of course it is

528
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:29,030
You do remember that the bad guys
have hostages in there?

529
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,300
Yeah
I figure a 33 to 48 percent loss

530
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,468
I can live with that

531
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,802
Really?

532
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,104
How sad for you

533
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:37,038
oh?

534
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,639
Your from New York aren't you?

535
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,074
No, not originally, no

536
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,510
I like happy endings and if we
don't get in there

537
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,078
If they blow up that school
you could be looking at

538
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,446
100 perecnt loss

539
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,614
Precisely my point

540
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,450
What is it you suggest we do?
Give in to his demands?

541
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:53,287
I suggest you think with your
heart not just with your badge

542
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,957
One body bag is going to be one
too many for the parents of

543
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:57,125
those kids

544
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,548
Let's get them all out

545
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,457
He's not gonna do what
I think he's gonna do

546
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,471
Shh

547
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,547
He's gonna do it

548
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,334
Watch it

549
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:06,594
Let's go, come on

550
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,915
Come on
Let's go, let's go, let's go

551
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,951
Mayfield power, can I help you?

552
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,219
This is the Mayfield police

553
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:33,221
I need to speak to whoever
is in charge

554
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,288
That will be Mr. Johnson

555
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,280
One moment while I connect you
to his office

556
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,276
Not now, wait! Wait!

557
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,997
Mr. Johnson's office

558
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,333
This is detective Worshak
of the Mayfield PD

559
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:47,034
I'm calling for Mr. Johnson

560
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,321
One moment please

561
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,021
Detective Worshak on 3

562
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,141
Detective, what can I do for you?

563
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,911
Sir, we've got a problem and we
need your cooperation

564
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,447
A group of terrorists have taken
control of the high school

565
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,514
Terrorists?

566
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,749
What are you talking about?

567
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,151
Look, this is an emergency

568
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,053
We have a hostage situation here

569
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,622
My two daughters go there

570
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:09,614
Jenny, get my wife on the phone

571
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,626
I don't have time for this

572
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,295
Turn on your radio or your TV
if you need conformation

573
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,596
Jane it's Jenny

574
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,265
Mr. Johnson

575
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,432
I've got your wife on the line

576
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,700
Well check if the kids are ok

577
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,902
One second detective

578
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:22,985
Are the kids there with you?

579
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,340
0k, they're there and
they're fine

580
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,377
But she says something terrible
is happening at the highschool

581
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,646
Sorry detective
now what can I do for you?

582
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,148
I need you to cut all the power
to the school

583
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,816
You don't understand

584
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,019
That means shutting down the
whole south west quadrant

585
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,654
I don't care if it's
the whole state

586
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:40,488
Just do it

587
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,390
Ok, 0k

588
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,225
Call the plant
get Berny on the line

589
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:45,626
Tell him to be ready for my order
to shut down the whole

590
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,277
south west grid

591
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,330
I'll leave the line open

592
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,465
Well if we get disconnected
you can reach me direct at

593
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,935
5555646

594
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,503
Got it, hold on

595
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,837
Whatever you say

596
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,556
I've got Berny

597
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,676
Be rny

598
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,610
Yeah?

599
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:05,046
Look, be ready to shut down the
whole thing on my order

600
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,048
What ever you say boss

601
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,549
Detective, detective

602
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,018
Will you give us an update
on the negotiation

603
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,853
Right now you know
as much as we do

604
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,890
We know that chief Slater's son
is somewhere up in that highschool

605
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:16,524
and we need to know what...

606
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,694
Hey, hey, if they find out his
son's inside that school

607
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:23,397
they'll use him and kill him
if we don't meet their demands

608
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,322
Would you want that to happen
to your son?

609
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,167
Shit

610
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,954
More people in there
than I thought

611
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:47,688
Guys

612
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:48,702
What?

613
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,793
Oh man, that's Mr. Vogel

614
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,228
Or was Mr. Vogel

615
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,129
Oh my god

616
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,330
Shh, Shh

617
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,015
Go, go, go, let's go

618
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:03,938
What happened?

619
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,657
Get back to work

620
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,044
You find them and you
bring them to me

621
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,433
Got it boss

622
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,529
You obviously don't take my
threats seriously

623
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,130
What the hell is going on in there

624
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,765
Don't play dumb with me

625
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,301
This little stunt of yours just
cost you one hostage

626
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,769
Wait, we didn't do anything

627
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,625
Then you should have prevented it

628
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,405
You and you, up

629
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,760
Now

630
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,596
Pick him up and follow me

631
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,794
We got a clean shot at two of them
first floor window

632
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:21,108
Take them out

633
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,930
No, no, hold your fire

634
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,053
I've got your son on the phone

635
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,355
What? Where is he?

636
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,223
He's in the principal's office

637
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:37,691
What? Leonard?

638
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:38,959
Leonard, are you all right?

639
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:39,593
Boss

640
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,162
What the hell are
you doing in there?

641
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,330
Well, you told me to spend more
time at school didn't you?

642
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,432
Leonard, get out of there
immediately, you hear me?

643
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,367
<i>All right, I'll try, I'll try</i>

644
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,302
Listen
here's the situation here ok?

645
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,971
All right, there's 5 of them left
they have 13 hostages

646
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,339
and they're all in
the assembly hall

647
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,574
And most of them are kids

648
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,075
A couple of them are teachers

649
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,112
And Eddy, Stacy and myself
we managed to stay hidden so far

650
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,781
Oh, by the way, you know
Mr. Vogel the principal here?

651
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,083
He's kind of dead

652
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,018
Yeah I know that

653
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,320
You know something ain't right
also they have a bomb

654
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,322
And if you have a bomb wouldn't
you put it in the basement

655
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,491
plant it down there
some maximum damage you know?

656
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:11,425
Yeah why?

657
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:12,960
Well they got it on the
second story

658
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,861
I mean the second floor

659
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,029
It's pointing out a window
like they're going to shoot

660
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,130
it at something

661
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,865
Leonard listen to me

662
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,733
Leny, Leny come on, they're coming

663
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:20,167
Got to go Pa

664
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,420
Speak to you later

665
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,418
Leonard, listen to me

666
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:26,689
Leonard

667
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,089
Worshak

668
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,958
Get me air reserve on the line

669
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,121
Leave him alone

670
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,738
What did you say?

671
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:44,425
Nothing

672
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,178
That's what I thought

673
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,598
Well?

674
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:51,865
No luck boss

675
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,735
If I was counting on luck
I would have ordered Lubritarian

676
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:55,703
Keep looking

677
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:57,024
Yes sir

678
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,562
Come on boys, come on

679
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:14,989
Wait a minute

680
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:16,023
Where are we going?

681
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,157
Shop class

682
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,649
Shop class?

683
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,166
General Wainright

684
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,303
Yeah General, this is Leo Slater
I'm the chief here in Mayfield

685
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,438
I need some information please

686
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,941
Oh yes
what can I do for you chief?

687
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,777
Have you had any security problems
there at the base lately?

688
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,646
Any robberies?

689
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,913
What do you mean?

690
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:43,450
I mean are you missing any bombs
or missiles?

691
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,053
That's classified
information chief

692
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,690
I can't deny or confirm that
information without approval

693
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:50,858
from Washington

694
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,926
Well listen General
here's what I can confirm

695
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,562
We have a situation here
and if your bomb is part of it

696
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,131
then you have a situation too

697
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:00,100
Now you can either talk to me or
you can talk to the media soon

698
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:03,203
as they're sniffing my hind leg
and I'm running out of answers

699
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,172
Now listen here whoever you are

700
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,573
General you listen to me

701
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,176
Now we have something pointing
at our nuclear power plant

702
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,412
I need to know if that's a problem

703
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,131
Jesus

704
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,750
Off the record

705
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,139
Yeah, whatever

706
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,474
0k, but you didn't get it from me

707
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:27,528
Shit

708
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:28,576
Get me Doogan

709
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,149
Yeah

710
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,458
Boomer, progress report

711
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,704
Almost got it

712
00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:38,753
Excellent, please continue

713
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,244
I'm beginning to get excited

714
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,581
Your enthusiasm overwhelms me

715
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:50,117
There's no need for sarcasm

716
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,921
We stand to make quite a fortune
when all this is through

717
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:58,025
And with two less people to share
it with

718
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,361
Yes, it is unfortunate

719
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:03,097
We could make it even less

720
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,099
Let's not get too greedy

721
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:08,736
At least until our little task
is completed

722
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:16,760
But you won't be upset if we
inherit a few extra shares?

723
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,679
The fewer loose ends the better

724
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:21,915
And I know how to handle
the loose ends

725
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,517
Oh yes you do

726
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:26,220
I've noticed you seem to have
quite a knack for it

727
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:29,323
Well, I just pay attention to
detail that's all

728
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,425
Don't be modest Tanya

729
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:34,962
I truly believe you have an
honest to go blood lust

730
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:39,333
I just do what needs to be done

731
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:44,238
Yes, but you can't tell me you
don't get some small measure of

732
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:45,539
pleasure from it

733
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:50,411
Oliver my darling
one should enjoy one's work

734
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,578
Don't you think?

735
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,536
Oh, absolutely

736
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,663
All right

737
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,899
Go in the supply room and get all
the empty bottles you can

738
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:14,201
Dude this is no time to be working
in a class project

739
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,869
This isn't a class project
trust me, just go

740
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,156
Come on, let's just go

741
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,469
Want some little girl?

742
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,809
I got two of them boss

743
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,617
Oh shit

744
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,350
Come on, come on

745
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:44,134
When you want your girlfriend
you know where to find me

746
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,998
Yeah, I'll take care of it

747
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,901
Mayfield Electric
they're ready to cut the power

748
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:03,503
Yeah, this is Doogan FBI
pull the plug

749
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,688
You got it

750
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:06,473
Be rny

751
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,507
Yeah

752
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,810
Kill it all, now

753
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:10,744
You got it

754
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:11,997
Here it goes

755
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,653
What's that?

756
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,021
You take him up to the
assembly hall

757
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:21,855
I'll handle it

758
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:22,311
Ok

759
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,484
When I give the word I want you
to go in and secure the area

760
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,037
Your siege plan won't work Doogan

761
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:38,205
I'm in command here

762
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:41,208
Well good, then you become famous
for a nuclear fallout that could

763
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:43,844
make Chernobyl look like
a weenie roast

764
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:44,578
What are you talking about?

765
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,447
I'm talking about an armor
piercing arrowhead missile

766
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:50,183
with a state of the alt
guidance system pointed directly

767
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,452
at a nuclear power plant
and that makes me nervous

768
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:53,453
Don't be ridiculous

769
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,555
He didn't mention a thing about
that in any of his demands

770
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,256
or his threats

771
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,991
Well maybe this guy is more of a
nut case than you

772
00:51:58,015 --> 00:51:59,826
give him credit for

773
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,284
It's our boy

774
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,467
I'm growing tired of your
silly antics

775
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,670
You don't really think turning off
the power is going to stop us

776
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:10,537
do you?

777
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,706
Well
it's the atomic energy commission

778
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,507
What?

779
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:19,646
So they can't disband unless they
shut down nuclear power plants

780
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,714
all over the country

781
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:24,084
And as you may know we here in
Mayfield get our electricity from

782
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:25,552
a nuclear power plant

783
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:26,687
Who is this?

784
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:28,188
This is Slater

785
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:29,690
And where is Agent Doogan?

786
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:30,791
I'm right here

787
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,926
They said they have to cut off all
the other sectors before they

788
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,494
can shut down the plant

789
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,396
And you expect me to believe this?

790
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,365
I'm just telling you what
they told me

791
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:42,135
Well, I'm telling you that as long
as the power is off

792
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,104
I'm going to be
disciplining students

793
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:45,138
What does that mean?

794
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,630
Figure it out

795
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:58,036
That's my direct line
I have to call you back

796
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:00,053
Johnson, you still there?

797
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:00,520
Yeah

798
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,289
Yeah, it's all been cut

799
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:06,226
I know, but now we have to have
you turn it back on

800
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,428
Excuse me for saying this but do
you guys know what the hell

801
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:09,930
you are doing down there?

802
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:14,118
We're trying our best to keep
sixteen kids alive

803
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:17,971
Be rny

804
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,206
Yeah

805
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,791
Look, you're not going to believe
this but

806
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,079
You got to be kidding

807
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,537
Here we go

808
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,023
What the hell are you doing here
there's still one missing

809
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,158
You want me to go get him myself

810
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,843
He's just a kid

811
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:41,828
I'll go get him

812
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,830
Well I wish someone would

813
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:47,085
I know how to handle little boys

814
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,624
What is your friend's name?

815
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,665
Won't you tell me?

816
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:58,912
Why?

817
00:53:58,936 --> 00:53:59,713
Because

818
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,914
Leny, Leny Slater

819
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,337
Shut up

820
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,569
Thank you

821
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,623
Wait, Slater?

822
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,639
Be sure to bring him back alive
I want to see this kid

823
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,379
Arrowhead 3 to arrowhead 1

824
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,313
Come in

825
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,982
Mission accomplished
all systems go

826
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,884
Guidance system is locked
on the main reactor

827
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:39,119
one hour and counting

828
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:40,508
Good work

829
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,524
Boomer, what if they were to shut
down the main reactor

830
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:47,093
No difference
the core would still be hot

831
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,261
Thank you

832
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,564
Would you kindly stay with the
unit until we have captured

833
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:51,965
the intruder

834
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,047
Affirmative

835
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,365
I hate school

836
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:18,925
Freeze mother fucker, hands up

837
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,246
Hands up, now

838
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,631
Right, hand it over

839
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,399
Hand it over now

840
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,481
Come get it

841
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,059
Come on boy

842
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,857
Come on

843
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,913
Drop it or
I'll blow his brains out

844
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,215
Boomer, toss me the detonator

845
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,416
Don't do it man

846
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,101
I said now

847
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,764
You are one sick bitch lady

848
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,132
Thank you

849
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:01,989
Now drop the pea shooter Rambo

850
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:13,395
Don't even try it

851
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:17,784
You've been a bad, bad boy Leny

852
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:20,620
You're not so tough after all
are you?

853
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:23,023
Come on, move it

854
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,858
You know my dad told me
not to fight girls

855
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:25,659
Good advice

856
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:27,549
In your case
I'll make an exception

857
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:11,805
Luther, send Black up the
west stairway

858
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,627
We've got him cornered

859
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,209
You think you can handle that?

860
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:17,291
I'll back her up

861
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:25,969
You better hope we find
your boyfriend

862
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,023
He's not my boyfriend

863
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,191
What a Pity

864
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:33,326
You'd make such a lovely couple

865
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,512
Dying in each other's arms

866
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,965
The only ones that are going to be
dying in each other's arms are you

867
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,582
and that demented slut

868
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,588
Hey man

869
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:47,254
No

870
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:49,860
My god

871
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:53,831
No respect

872
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,130
Shit

873
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:25,660
Wow

874
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:27,614
Reminds me of home

875
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:29,572
Oh Leny

876
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,734
It's all speculation

877
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:50,503
I can't advise evacuation of the
whole city without some

878
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,571
positive threat

879
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,940
Well there won't be any point
evacuating once they fire

880
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:54,674
that thing, will there?

881
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,443
We're not even sure they have
the missile

882
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,812
If we start evacuating the whole
city now, there'll be more deaths

883
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:02,348
from sheer panic than there would
be if they blew up the school

884
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,771
It's your son

885
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,552
Leny, are you all right?

886
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,387
Yeah paps I'm fine, I'm fine
but listen

887
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:07,954
They've got this thing

888
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,056
It's set, it's armed
it's ready to go off in less

889
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,824
than an hour

890
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:12,959
I overheard them saying the
guidance system is locked on

891
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,727
the main reactor

892
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,063
Look I want you to get out of
there immediately Leny

893
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:17,697
can you hear me?

894
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:18,898
I'm not sure about that dad

895
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,668
Look, this lady they got with them
she's got some sort of detonator

896
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:22,869
I think it's for the missile

897
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,838
Self-destruct detonator

898
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,940
It's the only thing that'll
stop it now

899
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:28,575
We have to get that

900
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,043
All right Leny
you're doing a good job

901
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:30,977
Good work in there

902
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,746
I want you to get out immediately
do you hear me?

903
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,814
No can do Paps

904
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,249
Look, they've still got
Stacy and Eddy

905
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,217
They've got me pinned down

906
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,085
The good news is there's only
three of them left

907
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,453
Can he get to the detonator?

908
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,957
This is a 17 year old kid who
skips physics class for Christ sake

909
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:46,259
Our only other choice is a
full frontal assault

910
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,461
Paps, Paps, you still there?

911
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,763
Yeah

912
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,565
Paps, I'm scared, what do I do?

913
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,717
All right Leny, listen to me

914
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:58,505
Oh great sure, sure

915
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:00,273
Yeah listen Paps, you want me to
throw in a cure for cancer

916
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:01,474
while I'm at it?

917
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:03,557
Your our best chance son

918
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:08,081
All right Paps, just let me ask
you one more thing all right?

919
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,482
What's that?

920
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:11,235
Can we move back to the Broncs?

921
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,553
I guarantee it

922
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:15,102
All right, I'll call you

923
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:16,890
Shit

924
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,541
I should have hit him up for a car

925
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:42,164
Hey

926
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,767
You scared the shit out of me

927
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,390
All three of these rooms are
connected, I checked them all

928
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:53,059
Well
I know he's around here somewhere

929
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,994
I can sense his fear

930
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,563
I'll check this hall

931
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:57,931
Oh, sure

932
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,934
Just get the detonator from the
terrorist, disarm the missile

933
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,221
No problem

934
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,006
Well I haven't checked the
teacher's lounge yet

935
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,691
so let's go check that out first

936
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:27,009
The receiver is warm
he can't be far

937
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,203
Check all these doors and closets
I'll get this side

938
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:38,194
All right

939
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:58,424
Great

940
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,075
Put it down right there

941
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:22,506
Not long now

942
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,536
Come here you little prick

943
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,101
Game is over Leny

944
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,370
Are you gonna come out like a
good little boy

945
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,839
or do I have to come in there
and get you

946
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,797
Promise you won't hurt me

947
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,677
I promise

948
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,965
Somehow I find that
hard to believe

949
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,154
Come on lady, you promised

950
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:46,014
You right Leny
but I had my fingers crossed

951
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:49,977
Now say goodbye

952
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,579
Well the old saying is true

953
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,731
The pen really is mightier
than the sword

954
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,166
Come on, You can't print that

955
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,967
Give me your number

956
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:28,822
Let me take that

957
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:37,934
Oh chief, my wife brought over
the best damn coffee in town

958
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:40,046
Your right

959
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,563
Remind me to have all out shoot
outs at your place from now on

960
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:47,720
I don't want to pry but I heard
your son had some problems

961
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,021
at the schools back home

962
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:52,811
Yeah, well, you know, good kid
bad environment, shit happens

963
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,248
Must have been tough on you when
you lost your wife

964
01:05:57,854 --> 01:06:01,434
Yeah, well that's one of the
reasons we came here

965
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,470
New beginning, fresh start
that kind of thing

966
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:08,241
Funny thing is that Mayfield's
usually a nice quiet place

967
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,176
I've heard, that was our plan

968
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,144
In fact the craziest thing I
remember happening was when

969
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,747
the environmentalists used to come
protesting the plant

970
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:17,049
And they were peace loving
hiPPV TYPES

971
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,252
Well that's what I don't get
Warshak, I mean why would anybody

972
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:21,954
be coming here to Mayfield to
stage a war with the

973
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,923
Federal Government?

974
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:26,325
Besides the power plant
there's nothing

975
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:29,228
Unless you count the
reserve incinerator

976
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,696
What?

977
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,398
Federal reserve incinerator
It's here

978
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,267
You know it's where they
inventory and then destroy

979
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:35,816
all the old currency

980
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,004
I've never heard of that

981
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:39,605
Come on, that's our claim to fame

982
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,841
We burn more money than
any town in the country

983
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:44,443
How much at any given time?

984
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,945
I'm sure it's millions

985
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:46,779
Well that's it

986
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:49,916
We're not dealing with a bunch
of right wing militant fanatics

987
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,351
here, we've got a common
bunch of thieves

988
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,352
The money if worthless

989
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,355
I mean all the serial numbers
are out of circulation

990
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,890
Who do you know who checks
serial numbers

991
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,575
Jesus Warshak

992
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,116
Hey everybody

993
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,123
Freeze

994
01:07:22,806 --> 01:07:26,538
Shit Eddy, Eddy
you all right man?

995
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,488
Bastard shot me man

996
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,378
Yeah I can see that

997
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:33,426
Got to get you out of here man

998
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,111
Forget me man

999
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,864
He took everybody up to the roof

1000
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,883
He made Stacy and the other guys
put on them suits

1001
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:45,538
This

1002
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,072
Yeah

1003
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:47,120
Ok

1004
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,109
Hey Lei'!!!

1005
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:51,692
Yeah man

1006
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,735
You're ok man

1007
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:56,949
You too man

1008
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:58,951
Eddy hang in there
I'll be back for you

1009
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:00,786
I ain't going nowhere

1010
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,855
Yeah I can see that

1011
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:03,846
Stay cool

1012
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,032
It makes sense, he wipes out the
town then I guess he and his

1013
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,600
men take whatever they want

1014
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:17,503
Well then why all the
free peoples militia bullshit?

1015
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:19,739
He probably needed to buy
some time to figure out

1016
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,440
the guidance system

1017
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,975
I say we move in

1018
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,525
I say do what you have to do

1019
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,127
Go for it

1020
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,823
Base, got some activity
up on the roof

1021
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,760
Looks like five anti-radiation
suits surrounded by what could be

1022
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,361
hostages

1023
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:43,944
Can you get a clean shot?

1024
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:46,232
Yeah, I think so

1025
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:47,600
No, wait, wait, hold your fire

1026
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,001
I'm in charge here Slater

1027
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:50,236
Yeah but something's not right

1028
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,804
There should only be three of
them left

1029
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:54,674
Decoys, he must have put some of
those kids in those suits

1030
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,475
This is not your call

1031
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,612
Listen there are 16 hostages
in there, one of them is my son

1032
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,814
This is not Wako
this is not Ruby Ridge

1033
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:04,316
This is Mayfield and I'm not
gonna allow you to screw it up

1034
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,284
You are way out of line

1035
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,318
I don't give a shit, shut up

1036
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:11,303
Hawkins, hold your fire

1037
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:23,169
They're pulling back but they
left something behind

1038
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:24,270
something big

1039
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,506
Let me guess, an arrowhead
armor piercing missile

1040
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,042
I'm no expert
but I'll take your word for it

1041
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:32,558
That conformation enough
for you General?

1042
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:46,058
Mr. Johnson's office

1043
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,811
It's Warshak, put him on

1044
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,283
It's Warshak

1045
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,904
Detective, we've been watching
it on TV

1046
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,973
You sure got your hands full
with that bunch

1047
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:02,475
Those poor kids

1048
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:05,211
Actually it's a lot worse
than you think

1049
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:07,613
They've put a nuclear missile
on the roof and aimed it

1050
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:09,115
at the reactor

1051
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:10,816
What?

1052
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,918
Those crazy bastards

1053
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,454
I want you to shut the reactor
down right away

1054
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:17,556
and get everyone the hell
out of there

1055
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,258
It's impossible

1056
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:21,727
Do you know how long it takes
to shut down a reactor?

1057
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:22,995
No, how long?

1058
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:25,397
12 to 24 hours, that's how long

1059
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:26,855
Christ

1060
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,936
Just send everyone home

1061
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,040
Home, you got to be kidding

1062
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,410
If that missile lands here
there won't be anything left

1063
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:41,046
standing or alive for 100 miles

1064
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,782
That bad huh?

1065
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:46,800
No, probably worse

1066
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:50,206
I'll leave the line open for you

1067
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,611
Sound the alarm

1068
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,818
Jenny, go home

1069
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:40,840
Come on let's go

1070
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:42,775
Come on, come on, come on, come on
come on

1071
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,563
No, no, come on

1072
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,365
Move it, in that room

1073
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:52,098
Right there, come on

1074
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,943
Let's go, let's go

1075
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,852
Ain't gonna do much good
without this asshole

1076
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:50,142
Well, well, well
you must be Leny Slater

1077
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,810
No, to you it's Mr. Slater

1078
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:52,912
Drop your gun

1079
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:53,545
Drop it

1080
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,162
I don't think so

1081
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:56,849
Do it

1082
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,151
Go ahead, you'll kill us all

1083
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:02,021
You see we took the precaution of
planting explosive charges

1084
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,589
throughout the building

1085
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:06,859
It's out little failsafe mechanism
if you will

1086
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:09,795
The charges are all wired to the
same frequency as the self-destruct

1087
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,997
mechanism on the missile

1088
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:16,788
In other words, if the missile
gets detonated prematurely

1089
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,883
so does the school

1090
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:21,740
No, you're bluffing

1091
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,232
I don't bluff

1092
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:26,760
0k, have it your way

1093
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:29,703
Don't do it Leny

1094
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,604
Ok

1095
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:41,309
The detonator too

1096
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,257
Carefully

1097
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,601
Get out of here, everybody get out

1098
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:34,627
School's out

1099
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:42,388
Listen to me, go to the
assembly hall, get Eddy

1100
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:44,779
and get out of the building
you hear me, get out of the building

1101
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:54,879
This is not my day

1102
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:07,312
Come on, come on, come on, come on

1103
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,430
Go, g0, 9°

1104
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,847
<i>Len'!</i>

1105
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:34,773
Hawkins, move in

1106
01:15:34,797 --> 01:15:36,675
I'm still giving the orders
around here

1107
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:37,843
Hawkins, move in

1108
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,044
Yes ma'am

1109
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,832
Guys, show time

1110
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:44,505
Very good

1111
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,207
We've got one on the roof

1112
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:54,626
He's going for the missile

1113
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,395
Take him out

1114
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:57,648
Yes sir

1115
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:39,338
Hey, good guy, good guy

1116
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:40,973
They've got this whole place
wired to blow

1117
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:42,141
We've got to get out of here

1118
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:43,442
Look

1119
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:44,991
Come on

1120
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,263
Get the hell out of here

1121
01:16:57,847 --> 01:17:00,509
Johnson, they've launched it

1122
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:21,395
Come on

1123
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,574
Outside, go, go, go

1124
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:36,546
Get in there, get in there

1125
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,199
Get him, get him

1126
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,954
Right, help me shut this thing off

1127
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:45,918
Close the doors

1128
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,466
Medics, come on, get in here

1129
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:39,815
Come on, help him out

1130
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:47,421
Leny are you all right?

1131
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:50,736
Stacy, yeah I think so

1132
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,570
Let's go find my dad

1133
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:53,084
Come on, let's get out of here
Ok

1134
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:57,943
You're all right

1135
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:01,013
Hi Pap, good to see you

1136
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,814
You are ok
Good. This is Stacy

1137
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:03,982
Stacy, hi
Hi

1138

I'm glad you're all right too
Thank you. Nice to meet you

1139
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,452
You'd better call your folks

1140
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:08,687
Yeah, you'd better do that

1141
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,155
Dad
we're going to the prom together

1142
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:13,058
0k, well it's gonna be outdoors
this year I think

1143
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,093
Looks that way

1144
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,762
Listen,
I'm gonna need some new clothes,

1145
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:18,630
new shoes and spending cash

1146
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:19,731
Could you rent me a limo
or something

1147
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,566
Limo, yes, sure

1148
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,535

1149
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:24,503
