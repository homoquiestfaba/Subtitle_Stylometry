1
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,830
You can't help everyone,

2
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,156
but everyone can help someone.

3
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,912
Hey, honey?

4
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,833
- You want to party?
- Doug, it's a weekday.

5
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,193
But if you asked him,

6
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,592
Doug Varney would tell you sayings
like these were fortune cookie horseshit.

7
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,875
Ethan?

8
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,833
Time to get up!
Hey, Ethan?

9
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,912
Hey, pal.

10
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,512
Jesus, God.

11
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,793
Jesus, God.

12
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,791
I appreciate his ingenuity,

13
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,753
but, you know, maybe we shouldn't
keep cookies in the house any more.

14
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,638
It's important for him to know
that when he behaves,

15
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,551
the treats that we
promise him are real.

16
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,794
If we take the cookies out of the house,
then those promises become empty.

17
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,757
- Okay, but he's not a dog.
- Excuse me.

18
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,638
He's a 12-year-old boy.

19
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,710
You know... Did you know that he
covered his windows in black paint?

20
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,634
- Did you know that?
- Yes. He asked me before he did it.

21
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,193
Do you think that it's okay for
him to live in a black box?

22
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,599
I think we need to
remain supportive,

23
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,116
even if his, um, interests are
different than ours, Doug.

24
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,279
You know, taking so many vitamins
all at once cancels out the impact.

25
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,035
Dad disagrees.

26
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,395
He's not a doctor.

27
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,915
Neither are you, sweetie.

28
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,912
When I'm in between jobs,
I like to get away

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,070
from the hustle and
bustle of Tinseltown,

30
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,071
which is why I've kept
a place in Woodbury.

31
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,596
Once you get past the candle
makers and fudge shops,

32
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,716
it's truly a beautiful place to live,

33
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,598
the kind of place where things
don't change all that much.

34
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,712
Which makes today so special.

35
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,472
Doug had done his time
at Bishop's Pharmacy,

36
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,993
working under his father-in-law

37
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,514
and learning the ins and outs
of running a small business.

38
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,596
And after years of delay,

39
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,913
Walter Bishop was finally retiring and
the pharmacy was changing hands.

40
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,069
Hey!

41
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,078
So long, Bishop's.
Hello, Varney's.

42
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,034
Um...

43
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,315
What's... Okay.

44
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,431
- I think there's been a mistake or...
- No mistake.

45
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,159
I just thought when we agreed to buy
the business from you, that, you know, we...

46
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,309
- All right.
- ... could change it.

47
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,312
- Let's put this to rest right now.
- Okay.

48
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,470
People know Bishop's.

49
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,518
Woodbury has trusted that
name for a long, long time.

50
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,076
They know they can count on
our service to always be right,

51
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,715
accurate, trustworthy.

52
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,473
What? Change the name
to Varney's or something?

53
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,913
Varney's?

54
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,516
Doug had gotten very good at hiding
disappointment over the years,

55
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,756
but that doesn't mean
this didn't hurt.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,112
The pharmacy might be officially his,
but nothing else was changing.

57
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,558
But despite what you might think,

58
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,757
Doug found great comfort
in being a pharmacist.

59
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,389
Studiously counting medication,
filling prescriptions,

60
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,914
he was good at what he did.

61
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,950
I saw it every time I came in.

62
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,757
But I could also see that Doug
Varney wanted something more,

63
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,308
and while he could probably
never put it into words,

64
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,152
maybe it had to do
with being a man

65
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,755
who provided solutions
for everybody but himself.

66
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,637
Consult!

67
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,789
Consult!
He's got...

68
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,110
I heard you the first two times.
Thank you, Janet.

69
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,436
As the one pharmacist
in a small town,

70
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,195
Doug knew a little bit
about a lot of people,

71
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,033
but he was always professional,
never judged,

72
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,238
and his customers always listened to him,
customers like Donald Zucker.

73
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,429
Donald had battled a weight
problem his whole life.

74
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,712
Doug gave him Lipitor as well
as some dietary advice,

75
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,951
but then Donald had never
been a very good listener.

76
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,229
Amoxicillin, Zoloft,
Metformin, Setrol.

77
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,478
Doug was there with
whatever they needed.

78
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,391
Kaye Tashman was
a loving mother,

79
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,074
but because sometimes
love just isn't enough,

80
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,549
Doug was there
with the Xanax.

81
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,518
And Tegretol for Susan D'Francesco,
because she was bipolar.

82
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,917
For Brian Malloy, Chantix to
help beat his nicotine addiction.

83
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,388
However, since side effects
included severe constipation, well...

84
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,955
And for poor Kathleen
Bergman, Lysodren,

85
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,914
because sometimes
cancer comes back.

86
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,309
And for mailman Arnold
Morello, Valtrex,

87
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,398
to treat his freshly acquired
case of genital herpes,

88
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,599
an affliction he most certainly
did not catch from his wife.

89
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,429
It's going to be okay.

90
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,251
It's just... It's all very
complicated. I mean,

91
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,363
I'd never been to
Atlantic City before.

92
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:56,798
Just be diligent about
the medication.

93
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,235
You'll feel better before
you know it, okay?

94
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,072
- All right.
- Hang in there.

95
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,310
Nice shorts, man.
Super shorts.

96
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,433
What the hell is
that guy on, huh?

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,397
- That's confidential.
- No, I know what it is.

98
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,357
Anti-depressants, I bet, right?

99
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,908
Postal worker, the end of his rope,
seconds away from this.

100
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,315
Look at all blood!

101
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,389
Okay.

102
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,994
But then, look,
he saves one for himself.

103
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,034
Just do me a favour.
Just don't wander off.

104
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,829
I got a new batch of deliveries
coming in for you soon.

105
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,955
I'm so happy you
brought this up,

106
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,508
'cause I would have totally forgot
and that's my fault.

107
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,750
- I know I said I could work
till late tonight... - Yeah.

108
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,799
...but my man Rio, he scored
tickets to Widespread tonight.

109
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,839
Get outta here. I know, it's insane.
So I gotta jet out way early.

110
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,119
Okay.

111
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,349
Uh...

112
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,553
But you promise to get all the
deliveries done before you go, right?

113
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,592
- Stop it. You have my word.
- Okay.

114
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,554
Hi, honey! Yeah, I'm gonna
be late. Yeah. Noah. It's fine.

115
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,872
Just grab dinner without me.
I'll get dinner somewhere. Yeah.

116
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,112
Something healthy.
I'll see you later, okay? Bye.

117
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,275
Roberts, Roberts,
Roberts, Roberts.

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,638
Junkies.

119
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,199
I hate rich people.

120
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,553
Hello!

121
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,549
Yes?

122
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,269
Uh...

123
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,231
You must be...
You must be Mrs Roberts?

124
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,993
Would you step inside?
It's a little chilly out here.

125
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,999
Okay.

126
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,399
Uh...

127
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,954
Nice place.

128
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,150
Like I said, it's a little chilly.

129
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,438
I'll get you sorted out
and I'll be on my way.

130
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,756
You probably think I'm
some kind of junkie, huh?

131
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,474
Well, it's not my business
to know how people got sick,

132
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,073
just how to get
them feeling better.

133
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,038
That's catchy.

134
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,476
Yeah, so it looks like

135
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,996
there was some confusion with
the insurance company and the...

136
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,036
It's not an issue.
How much do I owe you?

137
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,075
$215, plus the $8 delivery fee.

138
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,714
- Mmm.
- But I'll waive that.

139
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,708
That is so nice of you.

140
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,436
Are you gonna get in
trouble with your boss?

141
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,829
I am my boss.

142
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,670
I mean,
I'm the pharmacist.

143
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,749
You're Bishop.

144
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,879
Varney. I'm Douglas Varney.

145
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,031
No, everything says,
"Bishop. "

146
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,151
Well, is that gonna
be cash or cheque?

147
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,154
I'll get it.

148
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,958
Do you ever think about
calling it "Varney's"?

149
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,075
Hmm.

150
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,959
Nice doggie.

151
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,237
I had it done before the wedding.
What do you think?

152
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,355
- The portrait?
- Yeah.

153
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,714
- It's nice.
- Mmm.

154
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,878
Jack insisted on it.

155
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,510
They even made his
shoulders bigger.

156
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,950
- I'm sure he's a great guy.
- Oh, he certainly thinks so.

157
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,758
So I double checked the bill,
and it seems to be correct, so...

158
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,518
This is embarrassing, but it turns out
I only have about $20 cash on me,

159
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,155
and the only person in this household
who has a chequebook is my husband,

160
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,879
and he is still in the city, of course.

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,274
Oh. Okay, well...

162
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,271
No! I know what you're thinking.

163
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,876
I live in this fucking house,
I have a $70,000 Benz in the driveway

164
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,589
and I don't have enough cash
to order a pizza, so how would I not...

165
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,079
I know, that's what you mean.

166
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,196
I was gonna say,
"Not a problem. "

167
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,955
You can just come by the store
and pay the rest when you have it.

168
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,909
But I will have to take the Benz
as collateral, of course.

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,878
You're just one of those authentically
nice guys, aren't you?

170
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,359
Well, yeah. I guess so.

171
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,392
You're just honest and sweet.

172
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,471
Most girls don't always go
for honest and sweet.

173
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,229
Girls don't, but women do.

174
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,437
Okay, I'm just gonna get going and
you go... You can come by the store.

175
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,192
And you know where
the store is?

176
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,869
Yeah, 'cause it's...

177
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,634
Address on there,
so good night and thank you.

178
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,919
Hi.

179
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,678
Sorry I'm so late.

180
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,399
The deliveries were all out of order
and I didn't know all the addresses.

181
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,869
- Noah didn't even put them in the ledger.
- Ethan's school called today.

182
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,315
Oh, okay.
What's the problem?

183
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,995
Principal hyphenated-name,
she wouldn't say over the phone.

184
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,231
She says that we need to come
in ASAP for a conference.

185
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,639
Ooh!

186
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,837
Yeah, he painted his windows black.
Why are you acting so surprised?

187
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,672
Please just go upstairs
and talk to him.

188
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,633
Hey!

189
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,879
Hey.

190
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,311
So how was school today?

191
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,879
So you think you might want to come
out with us for a ride this weekend?

192
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,270
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Come on.

193
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,390
Open road, sunshine on your face,
the wind in your hair.

194
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,629
It'll be fun.

195
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,233
So you'll think about it?

196
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,790
Doug wanted to open the door and
talk to Ethan, but what could he say?

197
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,633
I mean, I know a thing or
two about working out.

198
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,592
And there's absolutely nothing fun
about weekend bike rides at all.

199
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,597
Come on, honey!
Let's take this hill!

200
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,553
Fucking misery.

201
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,073
Soon after Ethan was born,

202
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,392
Kara discovered road cycling was
perfect for shedding baby weight,

203
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,158
and Doug was on board.

204
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,550
He saw cycling as a chance for them
to do something as a young family,

205
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,996
and for a moment, it was fun.

206
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,553
For Kara, though, cycling turned
from hobby into profession,

207
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,072
inspiring her business at the nearby
Glen Rock Shopping Centre.

208
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,837
Come on! Grind it out! Cottage
cheese is for breakfast, not thighs!

209
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,397
And leading her to victory
at the Tour de Woodbury.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,434
She's won five out
of the last six races.

211
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,398
It's become the cornerstone
of Kara's year.

212
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,476
And the bane of
Doug's existence.

213
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,797
- And I said, "Armstrong?"
- That's right.

214
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,871
"More like headstrong. "

215
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,435
Doug, you made it.

216
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,237
There you go, Dougie.
You know the drill. Last man pays.

217
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,476
We waited 45 minutes
for you, Doug.

218
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,438
I just figured we'd
all eat together.

219
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,992
It's gonna be getting
dark now, okay?

220
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,635
- I want you to be careful.
- Okay.

221
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,438
Okay.

222
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,590
- Thanks, honey.
- Yep. See you at home.

223
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,269
Doug?

224
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,431
Oh, hey, Mrs...

225
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,669
Elizabeth.

226
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,435
Right.

227
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,955
Did you think about going
to medical school?

228
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,751
I did. I was, but then Kara got
pregnant, things changed.

229
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,718
We got married and this just
seemed like the logical choice,

230
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,112
especially with Kara's father
owning the pharmacy and all.

231
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,269
He's Bishop.

232
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,794
He's definitely Bishop.

233
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,030
- He's Bishop.
- Whoa.

234
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,795
And what about this?
The cycling thing.

235
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
You do that for the cool
clothes, or what?

236
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,357
Yeah, yeah. No, mostly I do it
because my wife expects me to.

237
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,759
Although I don't
share her passion,

238
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,876
I do think that a good cardio
workout three times...

239
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,712
Doug, can I ask you something?

240
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,673
Go ahead.

241
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,873
Do you do everything
your wife tells you to do?

242
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,148
Excuse me.

243
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,319
Yeah? Oh, no, I'm still here.
I've been here for fucking two hours.

244
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,596
You are... You are offensive.
You are... Oh, I...

245
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,077
Don't, no. No, just don't
fucking come then!

246
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,632
Sorry about that.

247
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,271
I really shouldn't
be saying anything

248
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,590
because you look like you're
gonna be very good for business,

249
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,148
but the pills in those
orange bottles

250
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,028
aren't always the solution to
people's problems, you know?

251
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,032
When you find that solution,
you let me know what it is, all right?

252
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,510
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.

253
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,919
Yes, you can.

254
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,357
- I appreciate it.
- See, I knew you could.

255
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,912
- I'm tipsy.
- Mmm-hmm.

256
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,718
- This has been really fun.
- Yeah.

257
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,473
- Hanging out with you
and just talking. - Yeah.

258
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,350
Seriously, Doug, I think this is the first
real conversation I've had in months.

259
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,513
Well, I am one of those
authentically nice guys, right?

260
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,034
And I'm a nice girl.

261
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,271
- Kindred spirits.
- Yeah.

262
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,918
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

263
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,150
And so these two kindred spirits made
one last stop before heading home.

264
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,153
Come on, now.
Come on.

265
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,152
Adultery?

266
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,038
Oh, please.
Save the preaching for church.

267
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,715
You'd change your tune, too, after
being balls-deep in a woman like Elizabeth.

268
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,911
My skull is exploding!

269
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,638
- Coming!
- Yes!

270
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,676
- I'm gonna come!
I'm gonna come! - Yes!

271
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,789
- I'm gonna come!
- Yes! Oh!

272
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,915
I'm gonna...

273
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,233
So,

274
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,795
what happens now?

275
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,476
I'm not really sure. This isn't
something I normally engage in.

276
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,714
Yeah, right.

277
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,231
I think maybe you go inside to your
wife and I go home to my husband.

278
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,955
Of course.
Yeah.

279
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,233
See you around.

280
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,551
Okay.
Good night.

281
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,954
Good night.

282
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,994
It has been a good night.

283
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,199
Ahh!

284
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,396
- Yeah! What is it?
- Hurry up, Doug!

285
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,639
Fuck off.

286
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,234
Mr and Mrs Varney,

287
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,110
we're all here to try to help work
things through the best way possible.

288
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,511
Maybe you can tell us what this is...
What this is about, huh?

289
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,193
It was brought to my attention yesterday
while he should have been in Life Science,

290
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,556
Ethan was discovered by
one of the faculty members

291
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,315
in the boys' locker room,
vandalising one of the lockers with...

292
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,389
Excrement.

293
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,792
And this isn't the first time.

294
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,075
- Substantial pieces of...
- Poop.

295
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,516
...had been turning up around the
school for the past two months.

296
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,910
There was no way of connecting
Ethan to the other leavings, but...

297
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,989
Excuse me.

298
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,393
Are you trying to suggest that my
son is some sort of Una-shitter?

299
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,000
Like I said, there's no
way to be 100% sure.

300
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,911
He has never had any
problems before.

301
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,310
No, he hasn't and...

302
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,789
That's right, so maybe you
need to look elsewhere.

303
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,869
- Mmm-hmm?
- Okay.

304
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,552
Like that David Chen kid.

305
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,599
You know, the one who brought the
fireworks on the class trip to Six Flags.

306
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,673
It seems likely the kid who's
toting explosives on a field trip

307
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,159
would also take a
dump in a locker.

308
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,719
- Mrs Varney.
- I'm gonna be sick.

309
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,349
This is nothing more than a
little boy crying out for attention.

310
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,794
And who are you again?

311
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,915
- Dr Roth.
- Okay.

312
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,035
School psychiatrist.

313
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,669
And your degree came from which
of our fine online universities?

314
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,829
Honey, they're just...

315
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,229
No, these are serious accusations

316
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,551
being made by complete strangers
with very little evidence.

317
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,394
Unless, of course, there's been
a major breakthrough in crime forensics

318
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,552
and you've dusted the
shit for prints, Dr Roth.

319
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,989
No.

320
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,997
If it's okay with you, I'd like to
start seeing Ethan twice a week,

321
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,391
- get a better idea of who he is...
- I think that's a good idea.

322
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,517
...and what's going on.

323
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,075
- Just to head off any...
- Honey.

324
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,196
...trouble at the pass.

325
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,395
Um...

326
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,952
Do the thing for us.

327
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,314
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Go on, go on. It's great.

328
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,073
- It's none of our business.
- Yeah, yeah. No, it's great.

329
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,354
Dr Friedman,

330
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,197
Mitchell, as top cardiologist here
at County General,

331
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,353
I'm surprised that you can't diagnose
true heartache when you see it.

332
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,429
But I love you

333
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,557
and I'll do anything
it takes to keep you.

334
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,269
And then we kiss!

335
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,476
That was great.
Wasn't it, Doug?

336
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,188
- Doug, wasn't that great?
- Huh?

337
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,995
Great!
That was just great.

338
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,231
So what happens now?
Do they call you back?

339
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,311
Only if you get the part.

340
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,634
- Did they call?
- Did they call?

341
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,750
No.
Not yet.

342
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,638
So everything okay down
at the store, Doug?

343
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,148
- Tip-top.
- Great!

344
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,032
That means we can
talk about Ethan.

345
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,991
You know, he's at
a pivotal age.

346
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,670
Things can get all fucked if
you don't keep him in check.

347
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,035
"Keep him in check"? What's that
even supposed to mean, Walter?

348
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,278
I think what Dad is trying to say

349
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,590
is that we should all keep an
eye out for Ethan right now.

350
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,069
Which is why I was gonna suggest that
he spend a few nights a week with us.

351
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,117
A change of scenery, along with
another stronger male influence.

352
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,189
What?

353
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,157
- Well, it would do the
boy some good. - Dad.

354
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,198
What exactly are you
suggesting, Walter?

355
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,113
- I'm not suggesting
anything, Doug. - Dad!

356
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,199
Why can't we just eat a meal
like a normal family? Right, Bree?

357
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,155
Mmm!

358
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,394
It's good like this.

359
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,119
- You want to try some?
- No, thank you.

360
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,393
Doug couldn't do it any more.

361
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,789
He was tired of being
pushed around,

362
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,715
tired of being ignored,
tired of being told what to do.

363
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,797
Things had to change.

364
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,950
God.

365
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,636
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Miss.
Hey, we're closed.

366
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,029
No, the thing says you're open.

367
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,278
Does it? Oh, look at... Check it.
Now we're closed.

368
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,476
So, I'm gonna have to usher you
out over here behind the door...

369
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,913
Wait, Janet!

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,433
What?

371
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,192
Wait, wait, wait.
Janet, Janet, hold on!

372
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,319
- Hi.
- Hello.

373
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,719
You told me to lock up.

374
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,588
I know what I said, but I think we
can help out one more customer.

375
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,877
You also said that
I could go, so bye.

376
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,632
Hey, nice to see you again.

377
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,950
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.
If you are closing early, that's fine.

378
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,431
No, no, no, no.
What can I do for you?

379
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,714
Uh...

380
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,710
Is everything okay out there?

381
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,238
Actually, I'm struggling
with something, Doug.

382
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,354
Me, too. I know.

383
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,398
I'm struggling between the
drunken chimney sweep

384
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,357
and this curious unicorn.

385
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,277
It's a big decision.

386
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,397
- A big decision.
- Right.

387
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,553
That is a tough one, but if pressed,
I would go with the unicorn,

388
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,154
the cornerstone in the
mythical forest series.

389
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,595
Well, it's settled then.
I knew you could help me.

390
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,877
Swallow something the
size of a breadcrumb

391
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,755
and farewell to depression,
anxiety, insomnia.

392
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,955
Mmm!

393
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,474
It's incredible.

394
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,284
You'll be swept away
into an artificial bliss,

395
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:50,235
made more assertive,
docile, erect.

396
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,917
You never get high
on your own supply?

397
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,754
That's illegal.

398
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,909
Of course it is.

399
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,191
But it must be hard working
in the candy shop all day long

400
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,314
knowing that any of your problems could be
solved by one of your little apothecaries.

401
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,317
Well, fortunately, I've never had to
take any medication for anything.

402
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,793
Oh, for being crazy like me?

403
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,308
That's...

404
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,556
That's not what I was gonna say,
and you're not crazy.

405
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,752
Mmm. My husband would disagree
with you on that point.

406
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,718
Come on, I mean, you're beautiful,
you're smart and worldly.

407
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,360
I dropped out of college
after three semesters,

408
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,873
and I'm worldly if you
consider the world

409
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,269
to be an investment banking
convention in Saint Lucia.

410
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,112
All I've got going for me, Doug,
is a rich husband.

411
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,432
Other than that, it's just a
list of things I want to do

412
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,353
and places I want
to see a mile long.

413
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,150
Well, you can argue me
on smart and worldly,

414
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,471
but I think you're
beautiful and lovely,

415
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,074
and there's nothing you can
say that'll change my mind.

416
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,798
Are you saying that because you mean it
or because you want to sleep with me again?

417
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,313
Oh!

418
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,709
- That was a mistake.
- Complimenting me or dropping...

419
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,028
We both got swept
up in the moment.

420
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,910
It was very nice, but I have a
family and you have a husband.

421
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,753
Both would be very
upset to lose us.

422
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,638
Fine. Yeah, you're right. It was a mistake.
Let's just put it behind us.

423
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,837
- I think it's wise. As friends.
- Like adults.

424
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,838
- I'm good as friends.
- Oh, good.

425
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,029
Adult friends.

426
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,591
- I'm gonna put it in you.
- Yes!

427
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,999
- I'm gonna put it in.
- Yeah!

428
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,479
- I'm gonna put it in you.
- Okay. Good.

429
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,038
God, I hope you're flexible.

430
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,558
Get down.
Get down.

431
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,837
Easy does it.
Okay.

432
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,318
All right! That's what I'm talking about.
Sweat it out with the oldies.

433
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,190
Hey, I need to talk to you.

434
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,599
Can it wait?
We're just getting started.

435
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,877
All right, let's get going,
you lazy Hausfraus!

436
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,032
You know what?
It can't wait.

437
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,277
Dr Roth called. Apparently, you cancelled
Ethan's appointment with him today?

438
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,555
Damn straight.
That guy's a quack.

439
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,200
Wow.
What do you suggest we do?

440
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,869
Oh, sure, another problem
I'm supposed to solve?

441
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,874
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means I've tried, all right?

442
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,238
And he's your son, too. All right?
So just be his father and do something.

443
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,392
It's called being a man, Doug.
Give it a try.

444
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,632
Who knows,
you might actually like it.

445
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,111
All right, you guys.
You ready to climb? Huh?

446
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,110
All right, turn it up, turn it up.
Out of the saddle.

447
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,753
Pick it up, Stan,
or get your ass outta here!

448
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,390
So Doug and Elizabeth made the decision
to be more than just adult friends.

449
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,308
Elizabeth taught
him about style,

450
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,317
how to kick back and treat
yourself now and then.

451
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,876
Warrior I and Warrior II.

452
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,116
Oh, and one more thing.

453
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,558
She taught him how to fuck.

454
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,678
Doug revelled in his newfound
freedom and he trusted Elizabeth.

455
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,357
So when she told him that a few pills
would make things even better,

456
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,351
he went along for the ride.

457
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,752
And you know what? She was right.
The pills made him feel good.

458
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,353
Real good.

459
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,638
Which got him thinking.

460
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,349
Anyone can take a pill,

461
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,829
but only a pharmacist knows
how to make one.

462
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,793
Percocet is nice, but when spliced
with atomoxetine and hydrocodone,

463
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,589
the party could go on for hours.

464
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,798
Fentanyl blended with oxycodone made
for a much more interesting day at work.

465
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,550
And even more interesting
lunch breaks.

466
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,991
He compiled his own personal grab bag of
psychotropic creations for them to enjoy.

467
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,595
He was elated, carefree, alive.

468
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,159
Elizabeth was right.

469
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,837
The solution to his problems had, in fact,
been lining his shelves all this time.

470
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,559
Doug had found better living
through chemistry.

471
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,916
He was no longer restricted by the
direction in which he could move.

472
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,959
He was more than a Bishop.
He was a king.

473
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,152
What is it? What?
What's wrong?

474
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,113
You need a little pick-me-up?

475
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,192
No. No, it's not...
It's not that.

476
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,033
I think I have some oxy left. We can
do that. That was fun. Or, oh, oh!

477
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,315
We can take a sleeping pill and keep
each other up and just trip out.

478
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,799
It's my wife.

479
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,509
Does she know?

480
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,116
Not at all and I almost want her to
so she can see how happy I am.

481
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,955
Oh, baby, I'm happy, too.

482
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,032
And also, she can see all that
sex stuff that we're doing,

483
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,553
like the thing you did on top.

484
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,279
- What was that?
- You mean reverse cowgirl?

485
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,433
Yeah, that was amazing!
I've never seen that before.

486
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,398
Yeah, you don't watch
a lot of porn, do you, Doug?

487
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,952
Kara busted me one time, you know?
She put a parental lock on my laptop.

488
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,032
- What the... Jesus fucking
Christ, Doug! - I know.

489
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,154
No, I just... I don't understand why a
guy like you puts up with shit like that.

490
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,275
You know, you deserve more!

491
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,033
Sure, maybe, but what am
I gonna do about it?

492
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,037
- Leave! Both of us, just leave!
- Huh?

493
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,230
Wouldn't it be great? We could go to Europe,
or Australia or Kathmandu, wherever.

494
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,073
We could just get out of here
and see the world.

495
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,189
You know?

496
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,396
Just imagine being able to hit
the reset button, you know?

497
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,234
Get a do over and make a life
with someone really, really great.

498
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,912
- That's great!
- Yes!

499
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,673
- You're great! Yeah! I can't!
- Oh...

500
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,510
What?

501
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,390
Kara would bleed me dry in a divorce
and you must have signed a prenup, right?

502
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,674
No, I did.

503
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,833
It's just another reminder of what I am.
I'm just a trophy wife.

504
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,515
If we don't age gracefully and die holding
our husband's hand at the nursing home,

505
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,589
we get replaced.

506
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,752
- What if he just went away and he just...
- He goes away, he comes back.

507
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,559
Yeah, but what if he
died or something?

508
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,359
- What if he died?
- What if he died?

509
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,351
Just died.

510
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,116
- Went on a trip.
- Didn't come back!

511
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,639
- He could die!
- He could die!

512
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,113
That would be great!

513
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,675
Get the dogs to eat him.

514
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,275
Oh, no, no, no. If I wanted to kill him,
I would just gain 100 pounds.

515
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,395
He'd have a heart attack.

516
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,550
- You know, if you really
wanted to kill him... - Yeah?

517
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,711
...you'd fuck with his
heart arrhythmia.

518
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,468
That would kill
him stone cold.

519
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,038
- I was joking.
- Yeah.

520
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,599
- No. I know.
- That was a joke.

521
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,629
I know. I know, baby. I was joking, too.
It's just, you know, his heart is a problem.

522
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,436
You know, it has been for years,
and you know, those...

523
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,513
Those pills are the only thing keeping
the damn thing ticking, you know?

524
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,639
And they could keep him going
another 20 years.

525
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,678
Another 20 years of cocktail parties

526
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,230
and fundraising dinners
and golf tournaments.

527
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,676
- I fucking hate golf so much.
- Me, too.

528
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:24,108
You know, it's just that sometimes
I like to imagine just me and you

529
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,510
and more money than we know
what to do with, you know?

530
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,068
Adds a little excitement to my life.

531
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,837
Like when I think about
how I'm falling for you.

532
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,030
I love you, too.

533
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,953
I love you so much,
but I should tell you,

534
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,952
there's a large number
of mandatory vaccinations

535
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,349
- we should get before we go to
Kathmandu... - Baby, baby, baby...

536
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,429
...well in advance.

537
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,717
Sometimes you need to know when
to just shut up and give it to a girl.

538
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,590
- Now being one of those times.
- Fantastic.

539
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,879
- Hey, Varney!
- Oh! Right!

540
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,112
Well, these are both fairly
aggressive stool softeners.

541
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,111
Either one should do the job.

542
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,549
Thanks a lot.

543
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,309
Thank you.

544
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,476
I'm sorry.
Are you Douglas Varney?

545
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,595
Yeah.

546
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,750
And you're the owner
of this establishment?

547
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,789
Yes.

548
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,677
Then how come it's called "Bishop's"?

549
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,793
You can pay for that
right over there.

550
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,072
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. Here I am,
I'm asking all these questions.

551
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,197
I haven't introduced myself.
My name is Special Agent Andrew Carp.

552
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,390
I'm with the Drug
Enforcement Agency.

553
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,353
Um...

554
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,034
Anyway, our records indicate

555
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,789
that this pharmacy recently changed owners
and no paperwork was filed,

556
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,758
so it's just protocol.

557
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,917
DEA.

558
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,913
- Yeah.
- Wow.

559
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,153
Janet, the DEA is here.

560
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,636
- How exciting.
- Hi.

561
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,237
Shouldn't you be wearing a windbreaker,
cool sunglasses, smashing down doors...

562
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,229
Well, not necessarily.
I'm not chasing Denzel or anything.

563
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,272
I'm just a regular guy, you know?

564
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,032
And what most people
don't realise, Mr Varney,

565
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,111
is that the misallocation
of prescription medicine

566
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,478
kills 29% more people than the
so-called glamour drugs. 29%.

567
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,309
That's like a third.

568
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,074
- Glamour drugs?
- Yeah.

569
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,434
You know, coke.

570
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,952
Crack, smack, E,

571
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,109
you know, P-Dog.

572
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,474
P - Dog?
What's that?

573
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,394
It's kind of like sherm,
but different.

574
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,948
- It's more...
- Oh. Gotta look into that.

575
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,794
- Noah, could we Arms and Hammer...
- In any event, the change of ownership...

576
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,108
Right, damn it, I'm sorry.

577
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,589
I just took over for my
father-in-law not too long ago.

578
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,477
- Yeah. - So I'm still trying
to get a handle on things.

579
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,358
Right. Nevertheless, I'm still gonna
have to take a look at that inventory.

580
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,555
- My inventory?
- Yeah.

581
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,393
- Why? I'm fully stocked.
- I'm sure you are.

582
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,233
I just have to ensure that the
actual dispensation of meds

583
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,118
matches up with the
prescription records.

584
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,995
- And make sure I'm on the up and up.
- That's right, Mr Varney.

585
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,674
Unless, of course, you're some
sort of no good thieving pill-popper.

586
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,348
I'm playing with you.
Loosen up.

587
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,709
No. I'm just kidding.

588
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,356
So, if I could...

589
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,874
Now might not be the best time.
It's just that we've been a little busy...

590
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,475
Mr Varney, a little trade secret.

591
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,075
I don't want to be here any more
than you want me to be here

592
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,111
and between us, you are hardly

593
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,591
what I would consider to be
a high-risk establishment.

594
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,275
You know what I'm saying?

595
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,279
I'm gonna hop to it, okay?

596
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,237
And I'm gonna be out of your hair
in 30 minutes tops.

597
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,553
Thirty minutes.

598
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,235
Hello?

599
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,239
Hey, it's me.
It's Doug.

600
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,517
Hey, hi.
What's going on?

601
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,396
What's going on is that I've got a fucking
DEA agent going through my inventory.

602
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,789
- That's what's going on.
- Mmm-hmm.

603
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,075
Do you know what will happen
if we get caught?

604
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,390
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
Calm down.

605
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,079
All right?
Take a deep breath.

606
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,311
- Namaste. Okay?
- Okay.

607
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,473
Listen, if you act guilty,
he's gonna think something's wrong,

608
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,199
but if you just act cool,
then he's gonna think that...

609
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,713
That everything is normal.

610
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,315
Exactly. So just pop a Zannie
and take it easy, baby.

611
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,153
Besides, the DEA agent
who investigates pharmacies?

612
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,389
Come on, please.

613
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,199
The guy probably accidentally
shot his gun and got demoted.

614
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,591
Thanks.
You're the best.

615
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,791
Okay, I'm busy.
I gotta go. I'm busy.

616
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,995
- Okay.
- Okay.

617
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,635
Are we all done here?

618
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,275
I just need to see the stuff
with the pseudoephedrine.

619
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,554
Right.

620
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,798
I got a box.

621
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,916
- Take it somewhere.
- Yeah.

622
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,069
Right over here.

623
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,152
Fuck, Ethan.

624
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,589
It's loud.

625
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,593
Don't you think?

626
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,189
You're supposed to listen
to Mastodon loud.

627
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,756
Of course.
Mastodon.

628
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,998
I brought you a snack.
So how was school today?

629
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,995
Huh?

630
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,434
I mean, okay, I guess.

631
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,074
Any idea why they might
have suspended you, then?

632
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,590
What the...

633
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,478
What the fuck are these?

634
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,116
- Golf clubs. - I know that.
What are they doing here?

635
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,873
Grandpa bought them for me.
Said I needed a new hobby.

636
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,635
I told him I already have a hobby,
but he didn't seem to care.

637
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,671
Golf is fucking stupid and elitist.

638
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,115
And so is your fucking
grandfather. Fuck!

639
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,000
Fucking fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

640
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,879
You know what I mean?

641
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,997
Listen to me. Your mother might
not agree with me on this one,

642
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,268
but Grandpa doesn't always
know what's best.

643
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,513
Learning to play
golf or bike riding

644
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,831
or any of that stupid
activity horseshit

645
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,230
isn't gonna make you
perform better in school.

646
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,551
Dr Roth said something about
putting me on, like, a medication.

647
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,234
- Am I sick?
- No! No!

648
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,399
You're just 12.

649
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,751
And being 12 sucks for everyone

650
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,479
and everyone goes through
some weird shit at your age.

651
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,120
I mean, I used to fuck the
couch when I was 12.

652
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,509
- What?
- You heard me.

653
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,477
Instead of using my hand to,
you know,

654
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,031
I'd stuff a towel in the couch and,
well, fuck it.

655
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,919
That is crazy.

656
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,951
It ain't easy at your age,
you know?

657
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,476
But then one day you look up

658
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,190
and you're okay again without
doctors or drugs or anything else.

659
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,475
If you say so.

660
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,714
- Couch fucker.
- You're a couch fucker.

661
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,518
- So what's this hobby you got?
- Oh.

662
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,275
Far out.

663
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,958
There are 18 different weapon
disciplines to master.

664
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,952
- I've only got 11 so far.
- That's awesome.

665
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,278
Really?
You're not mad?

666
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,553
Well, I don't know. Should I be?
I don't know much about ninjas.

667
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,074
No, no, no, no.
I just collect the stuff.

668
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,948
It's not like I'm out there killing
squirrels or destroying public property.

669
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,198
Would you like to?

670
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,392
- What do you say? Give me one.
- Okay.

671
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,794
- Oh!
- Oh, shit! Shit!

672
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,075
I don't know if this is
a good idea, Dad.

673
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,191
It's not. It's a great idea.
Give me a cookie.

674
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,835
Wait.

675
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,755
- It was fun.
- It was, wasn't it?

676
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,476
Hey, I know you don't want to talk,
and quite frankly, neither do I,

677
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,791
so just tell me what this shit
stuff's all about at school.

678
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,632
Well, in ninja code, it's written
that it's the highest insult

679
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,269
to smear one's excrement
on the home of his adversary.

680
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,713
Gotcha.

681
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,238
Kevin Redmond, Andy Berg,
David Chen, they're all dicks.

682
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,916
All they do is make
fun of me, so...

683
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,029
So you insult their honour
with your poop?

684
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,429
Yeah.

685
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,756
Well, I think you've achieved
the desired effect.

686
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,469
So do your old man a favour
and give it a rest, okay?

687
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,959
All right.

688
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,110
Be quiet.
Your mom's asleep.

689
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,598
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

690
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,355
There's this thing next week. Bring
Your Dad to School Day or some shit.

691
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,317
And it'll probably be gay, but I think
it would be cool if you showed up.

692
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,354
You're on.

693
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,388
Cool.

694
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,553
Everyone, just stand back.
Thank you.

695
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,232
What in the fuck happened here?

696
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,073
Mr Bishop. I'm Officer Willits.
We spoke on the phone.

697
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,309
- You said, "Incident. "
- Mmm-hmm.

698
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,278
There has been an incident?
This is a goddamn war zone.

699
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,395
Yeah.

700
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,517
Oh, fuck me running.
Who could have done all of this?

701
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,872
I'm not sure, Walt,?

702
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:51,092
but I think Officer Willits had a
promising lead on, what was it?

703
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,429
- Ninjas.
- Mmm.

704
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,359
What the fuck is a ninja?

705
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,358
It's an ancient Japanese warrior cloaked
in black, often with mystical powers.

706
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,590
- Sounds pretty serious, Walt.
- Wait a minute.

707
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,908
Why would an ancient
Japanese warrior

708
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,594
destroy a fucking pharmacy
sign in fucking Woodbury?

709
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,188
Sir, our investigation is ongoing.

710
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,113
As soon as we get some more
information, we'll let you know.

711
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,758
Well...

712
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,598
Doug, what are we
gonna do about this?

713
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,396
Well, I think it best we leave it in the
capable hands of the Woodbury PD.

714
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,596
They seem to have
things under control.

715
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,113
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got some business to attend to.

716
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,190
Doug did have business
to attend to.

717
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,635
Fuck!

718
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,878
There was no time to dwell
on his latest victory,

719
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,952
because an even greater
challenge lay ahead,

720
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,191
ending Kara's reign at
the Tour de Woodbury.

721
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,669
- Consult!
- You do it!

722
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,513
And he knew just how
to make that happen.

723
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,837
Using a base of Hypertropin growth
hormone for quick recovery,

724
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,037
cutting in magnesium hydroxide
to stave off cramping,

725
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,634
highly concentrated doses
of Adderall for focus,

726
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,671
oxycodone to numb his legs

727
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,752
and 10 ccs of good old-fashioned
methamphetamine

728
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,592
for that extra kick in the end.

729
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,956
It was most definitively
a recipe for success.

730
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,715
Watch out.

731
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,237
Make a hole, people.

732
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,911
Come on.
Make a hole.

733
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,590
Ho-ho! Look who it is.

734
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,309
You sure you want to get tangled
up front with the big dogs, Dougie?

735
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,517
Hey, Ed, maybe you should worry
more about that clotrimazol cream

736
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,352
clearing up that fungus
inside your asshole,

737
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,318
and less about where
I start the race, huh, boy?

738
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,753
What are you doing, Doug?

739
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,638
Making a red velvet cake.
What does it look like I'm doing?

740
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,075
You don't actually think you can
compete in this thing, do you?

741
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,355
I'm not here to compete.
I'm here to win.

742
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,828
Sure you are.

743
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,399
Let's do this.

744
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,515
The race was on and unfolded
the same way it always did,

745
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,549
Kara jumping out to a substantial lead
while the pack settled in behind her.

746
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,833
And Doug pulled up the rear.

747
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,155
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on, Dad! Go!

748
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,876
But this year, Doug was just biding
his time, laying in the weeds,

749
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,431
and when the time was right,
Doug did what Doug did best.

750
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,551
And brought down the thunder.

751
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,268
Not today, Varney!

752
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,555
I told you not to get tangled
up with the big dogs!

753
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,274
On your left!

754
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,758
You got lucky, baby.

755
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,437
Whoo! Yeah!

756
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,919
Doug Varney was not
used to winning.

757
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,989
Yes!

758
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,435
But he was beginning
to enjoy how it felt.

759
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,753
- Hi.
- Hey.

760
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,832
- You all finished in there?
- Yeah.

761
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,595
- Yeah? Did you get it all done?
- Yep.

762
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,033
- Clean it up?
- Mmm-hmm.

763
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,354
You like? You see
something you like?

764
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,355
No?
Whatever.

765
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,149
Here, Doug.

766
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,875
- I was impressed with
you today. - Yeah?

767
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,238
I didn't... I didn't know
you had it in you.

768
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,551
You'd be surprised
what I'm capable of.

769
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,518
Oh!
God!

770
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,680
Mr Tough Guy, huh?
Now that he wins a race.

771
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,034
What are you doing?

772
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,030
Sometimes you gotta know when
to shut up and just give it to a girl.

773
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,189
It's called being a man.

774
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,152
Oh!
Doug!

775
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,511
Oh, shit!
Oh!

776
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,190
Oh! Oh! Oh!

777
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,869
Harder!

778
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,271
Oh, my! Oh!
Oh, my God!

779
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,550
I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come.

780
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,711
Ohh!

781
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,078
That was incredible.

782
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,879
I know. I'm gonna go
make pizza bagels.

783
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,108
Victory tasted sweet.

784
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,871
The hangover

785
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,838
from his recent drug
binge did not.

786
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,351
That is some trophy.
Mmm!

787
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,112
She is a beaut.

788
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,349
I won one like that once at
a high school track meet.

789
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,429
What was the event?

790
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,192
Oh, yeah.
Steeplechase.

791
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,069
Difficult event.

792
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,551
Heck yeah. Yeah, it is.
Oh, yeah. But you know what?

793
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,598
There's something about people
chasing you that brings out your best,

794
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,795
you know what I'm saying?

795
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,995
Anyway, it's the darndest thing, Mr Varney.
I was checking the data from the inventory

796
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,948
against our prescription database
again today and it just didn't add up.

797
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,069
Hmm.

798
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,633
Not at all.

799
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,837
Shit, that's...
That's odd.

800
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,309
Isn't it, though?
That's what I thought.

801
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,594
I didn't realise you were a
compounding pharmacy, Mr Varney.

802
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:33,676
Oh, this? We're not really... I had this
one customer, an older gentleman.

803
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,040
He's all fucked up. Parkinson's.

804
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,549
He has trouble swallowing

805
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,029
so I have to make up a paste
for transdermal application.

806
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,314
And what customer would this be?

807
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,029
- You know I can't tell you that,
Agent Carp. - I'm sorry.

808
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,951
I didn't notice that when
I was here before.

809
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,189
Anyway, I'm sure this
is all just a glitch

810
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,111
but if I could just see your
prescription ledgers

811
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,998
for the past, say,
12 months,

812
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,355
and then I'll get out of here
just as quick as I can.

813
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,512
Sure thing. The only problem is
I have them at my home office.

814
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,477
- Your home office? - Yeah,
so why don't you come in Monday

815
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,755
- and we can talk about it then?
- Mr Varney, you're aware

816
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,116
that the federal code 101B12
of the Narcotics Distribution Act

817
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,556
states that all ledgers be kept
at the licensed facility?

818
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,917
And 99.9% of the time they are.
It's just that...

819
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,199
It's just that after your last visit,
I was so concerned with getting things right

820
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,636
that I took my ledgers home to double
check against my own records,

821
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,633
which I keep on my personal
computer at home.

822
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,835
Right.

823
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,512
So...

824
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,355
I mean, look, I spilled a bottle
of amoxicillin the other day.

825
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,948
I got most of them,
but I might have missed a few,

826
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,031
may have even
stepped on one.

827
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,079
I didn't say anything because, well, like
you said, everyone does that now and then.

828
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,919
Everyone but Walter Bishop.

829
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,956
Okay. I'll tell you what.

830
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,589
If you want to hang out for a bit,
I can run home and get them right now.

831
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,753
That won't be necessary, Doug.
I'll be back this way in a couple days.

832
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,434
How about you just have
them here for me then?

833
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,309
You got it.

834
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,951
And, hey, thanks again, Agent Carp,
for letting me off the hook.

835
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,117
Well, this investigation's
still pending, Doug.

836
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,397
I haven't let anyone
off the hook yet.

837
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,311
Okay, I'm in.

838
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,472
What do you mean "in"?

839
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,075
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

840
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,515
Hold on. Hold on.
You're in for what?

841
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,034
- For the plan, you know?
- What plan?

842
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,035
Jack, you know, let's do it.
Let's start over. Let's do it, baby.

843
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,475
Doug, wait a minute.
That was a joke.

844
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,234
- Come on, we were joking.
- I know! I know we were,

845
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,433
but, I mean, I've been thinking,
you know, a lot. I've been thinking a lot.

846
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,794
What is this, chardonnay?

847
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,998
About everything and, I mean,
my wife fucking hates me.

848
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,230
This Carp guy's all over me.

849
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,309
Here.

850
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,435
- A sedative?
- Here you go.

851
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,509
Thanks.

852
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,313
And I guess what I'm saying
is that, you know, you're right!

853
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,469
You're always right.

854
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,953
I'm the pharmacist,
and he's the guy with the bad heart.

855
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,519
You know what I mean?

856
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,435
Okay. Let's do it.
Tomorrow.

857
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,155
Wow.

858
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,434
Okay, wow. That's soon.
That soon?

859
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,710
Well, I don't want to waste
any more time being unhappy.

860
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,718
- Do you?
- Okay.

861
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,079
I usually head out
to our beach house

862
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,878
Friday morning to beat
the weekend rush,

863
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,070
so it won't be a surprise
that I'm gone.

864
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,919
As you know, Jack takes a lot
of medication for his heart.

865
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,991
ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, ARBs.

866
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,470
Yes, that's a powerful mix.
I usually recommend valsartan, but that's...

867
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,039
Not really important
right now, is it?

868
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,111
What's important is the dosage.

869
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,159
Because of the various drugs, Jack gets
a 300-milligram dose of eprosartan,

870
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,118
but if he were to get,
say, 400 milligrams,

871
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,318
that slight bump in combination with
his usual after dinner trough of scotch,

872
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,914
well, then when they call me
at the beach the next day,

873
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,879
it's, "Oh, my God, Officer.
I'll be there as soon as I can!"

874
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,157
I'm his sole beneficiary,
so I sign some papers, collect it all,

875
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,993
and tell them to wire the funds
wherever we end up.

876
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,755
- Oh, so that's it, huh? Just like that?
- Just like that.

877
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,956
You get to tell that cunt on
wheels where to stick it

878
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,031
and we can spend the rest of our
lives buying whatever looks good

879
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,633
and giving each other
mind-blowing orgasms.

880
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,472
Oh, my God, this is exciting!

881
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,589
- This is great!
- It's great!

882
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,717
Wait! Wait! There's just something
really, really important.

883
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,993
- You can't call me.
- What?

884
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,753
No contact whatsoever. Nothing
that could leave a trace, okay?

885
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,637
Well, how long? That's how long?

886
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,598
At least until it all blows over,
maybe a little longer.

887
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,549
Baby, here.

888
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,149
You relax, and let me give you a
little something to remember me by.

889
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,440
You don't have to do that.
Okay.

890
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,919
Fax orders came in.

891
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,709
Doug filled Jack's order
like he always did,

892
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,758
but with one slight
and deadly change.

893
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,596
Noah. Noah.

894
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:43,637
I'm sorry! Here. Here!
Is it an "M" or a "W"? I don't know.

895
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,638
Hey, hey.

896
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,549
Hey.

897
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,915
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you on?

898
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,628
Are we being bros?
Are we being straight bros?

899
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,751
If we're being bros,
last night, I went out real hard.

900
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,877
I got on a Segway and I just went
to every place that served alcohol.

901
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,071
- Are you okay to drive at least?
- I drove here, didn't I?

902
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,551
It's imperative that all these
deliveries make it out today.

903
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,675
All of them.

904
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,755
People have been
complaining about you, Noah,

905
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,078
and we need to show our customers
that we can still be counted on,

906
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,314
like that big clock in the square,
to always be right, accurate.

907
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,197
- Mmm-hmm.
- Trustworthy.

908
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,033
That clock? That clock is broken, Doug.

909
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,791
Just make the deliveries,
okay, Noah?

910
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,275
You can count on me.

911
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,955
No, I can't, which is why we're
having this conversation.

912
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,953
Okay! I'm going! Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

913
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,237
Can you smoke in here?

914
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,229
- No!
- Sorry.

915
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,837
Can I get some more water? I like to
hydrate when I'm getting trashed.

916
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,752
- Hi!
- Hey!

917
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,957
It's mailman Morello!

918
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,840
Hey, Arnie! You ever get
back to Atlantic City?

919
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,678
Yes? No?
I speak-a the English?

920
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,835
- Let's go.
- Where you going?

921
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,478
They didn't realise I'm the man
behind the curtain, the wizard.

922
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,788
I pull the strings.

923
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,871
Hey, Lloyd.
Is anybody sitting here?

924
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,029
Be my guest.

925
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,429
- Hey, Lloyd, I called in for
a to-go order. - Mmm-hmm.

926
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,273
Let me have a Black Label,
neat, too. Thanks.

927
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,475
Okay.
How about you?

928
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,438
Another vodka martini,
my good man, on the rocks.

929
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,794
- Good.
- Extra olives.

930
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,677
- I know.
- He knows.

931
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,352
That's the exact same
drink my wife orders.

932
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,475
It is?

933
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,348
Yeah, I mean, then again,
martinis are pretty popular, huh? I guess.

934
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,352
Do I know you?

935
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,477
Jack Roberts. I just moved
in a few months back.

936
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,233
I live over on Donneybrook.

937
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,118
- I'm Doug Varney. Yeah.
Good to meet you. - Yeah.

938
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,874
- That big place on the
cul-de-sac, right? - Yeah.

939
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,748
Well, it's too big if you ask me,
but that's what my wife wanted.

940
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,108
You live in town?

941
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,478
Just over 10 years now. I own the
pharmacy in the square, actually.

942
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,233
Really? Well, then you definitely
know my wife.

943
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,674
Why would you say that?

944
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,037
She eats enough pills, she can
keep Pfizer in business by herself.

945
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,989
- I'm sure you know her.
- Well, we get a lot of customers.

946
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,638
I can't even think of somebody...

947
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,039
- Thanks, Lloyd.
- Sure.

948
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,232
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

949
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,235
Are you married?

950
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,435
Why? Are you trying
to pick me up?

951
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,117
- Well, marriage is hard
goddamn work. - Yeah,

952
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,431
they don't tell you that when you're
registering at Crate and Barrel, huh?

953
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,714
No, they do not.

954
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,588
I've been married three times.
I still have no clue what I'm doing.

955
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,438
I've always been the type of guy that
keeps a steady stream of gifts rolling in

956
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,238
just to avoid conflict.

957
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,232
You know? I make
a nice living. I'm lucky,

958
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,595
so why not spread it around?

959
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,877
Women are tough, but there's
nothing like seeing their face.

960
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,191
It just lights up when you bring home
some flowers or something sparkling.

961
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,272
I like that. It makes me
feel good. You know?

962
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,471
Wifey's away,
so I'm cooking tonight.

963
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,872
I know what that's like.

964
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,832
Lloyd, let me take care
of his drinks, too, okay?

965
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,752
You shouldn't do that.
That's very nice of you.

966
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,149
It's the least I could do
for a new neighbour.

967
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,078
Besides, I heard what those
vandals did to your pharmacy.

968
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,550
That's disgusting. Horrible.
I'm sorry about that.

969
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,029
All right.

970
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,758
- Have a good night. Bye, Lloyd!
- Bye-bye!

971
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,512
- Bye, Eve.
- Thank you.

972
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,235
My pleasure.

973
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,595
Hey, barkeep.

974
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,354
I think you've had enough, pal.

975
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,109
I just want a pen
and some paper.

976
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,349
No more drinking.

977
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,635
Just give me a pen and
some paper. Thank you.

978
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,350
Dear Kara, I think we both know
that it's time for things to change.

979
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,239
I know I'm not the man your
father thought you deserved.

980
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,551
You know what? I don't...
Your father's a fuckin' asshole.

981
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,433
This will be hard on Ethan,
and that breaks my heart,

982
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,555
but in the long run,

983
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,995
it's better to be raised
by two happy parents apart

984
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,435
than miserable ones together,

985
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:38,118
but if he starts in with that shitting stuff
again at school, you let me know.

986
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,748
There's a whole world
out there, Kara,

987
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,759
and it's time for me
to experience it.

988
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,353
You should check it out yourself

989
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,273
and not just from the
seat of a bicycle.

990
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,279
We've both made mistakes.

991
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,918
That all ends tonight.

992
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,276
I wish I could have been a stronger
man for you. I really do.

993
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,749
But, damn, do I wish you
had been a better woman.

994
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,034
Take care of yourself.

995
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,269
Doug.

996
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,230
What the hell am I doing?
What am I doing?

997
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,348
Hey, where are you going?

998
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,631
Hey. I gotta head to work.
Early bird and all that.

999
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,749
Wait, Dad.

1000
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,193
- Dad!
- Yeah?

1001
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,918
You're coming into
school today, right?

1002
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,669
Of course.

1003
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,629
Right. I wouldn't miss it for
the world, buddy. I'll be...

1004
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,312
- I'll be there.
- Bye.

1005
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,115
Hello!

1006
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,711
Hello?
Hello?

1007
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,829
Jack!

1008
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,399
Jack!

1009
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,596
Mr Roberts!

1010
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,199
Jack!

1011
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,273
Fuck. I fucking killed him.

1012
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,996
Help! Help!
Somebody!

1013
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,119
Hello! Anybody there?

1014
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,229
Take it easy.

1015
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,388
Ahh! Nice doggie!
Nice doggie!

1016
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,473
Hey, it's me.

1017
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,676
God damn it, pick up the phone!
Please!

1018
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,632
Elizabeth! Where are you?
I think I killed him!

1019
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,073
I think I fucking killed him!

1020
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,593
God damn it!
Fuck!

1021
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,669
Fuck!

1022
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,109
God damn it.

1023
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,632
Come on! Come on!

1024
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,115
God damn it!

1025
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,278
God damn it.

1026
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,999
Let's go!

1027
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,709
Oh, shit!

1028
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,358
Aw, fuck!

1029
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,875
Okay, next up is Mr Varney.

1030
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,269
Mr Varney? Mr Varney?

1031
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,113
Good morning...

1032
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,999
Everyone.

1033
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,356
- Good morning, Mr Varney.
- Good morning, Mr Varney.

1034
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,675
Class, Mr Varney

1035
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,149
is gonna tell us all about
being a pharmacist.

1036
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,715
You're bleeding.

1037
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,195
Huh?

1038
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,633
- You're bleeding.
- No, I'm not.

1039
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,878
- Ew!
- Douglas Varney.

1040
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,075
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You are under arrest.

1041
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,673
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

1042
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,633
Ahh!

1043
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,069
Take it easy.

1044
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,229
Hey.

1045
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,311
Whoa.
Whoa.

1046
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,317
Jeez!
Not in front of my kid.

1047
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,799
You have the right
to remain silent.

1048
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,114
Anything you say

1049
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,156
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1050
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,994
Do you understand me or not?

1051
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,998
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?

1052
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,949
Let's give a big round of applause
for Christopher's father.

1053
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,678
Officer Willits!

1054
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,954
Great stuff, man!

1055
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,158
All right! All right!
All right.

1056
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,269
Now, being a police officer is
about more than kicking ass,

1057
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,595
car chases and guns.

1058
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,557
Yeah!

1059
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,792
All right. It's about protecting
and serving your community.

1060
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,190
It's about making sure that Woodbury
is a safe place for you all

1061
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,396
to work and play. It...

1062
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,195
Oh!

1063
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,269
Oh, excuse me one second, please.

1064
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,588
Joke's on me.

1065
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,398
One more time please, with that.

1066
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,355
I'm gonna have to ask
you to come with me.

1067
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,913
All right.
All right.

1068
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,919
We're gonna take a walk.

1069
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,999
I didn't know what to say.

1070
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,389
I was with my son.

1071
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,552
Mr Varney.

1072
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,353
Can we lose the cuffs, please?

1073
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,279
Give us a minute, all right?

1074
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,519
Now listen, none of this should
come as a surprise to you

1075
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,672
given the inconsistent state
of affairs around here, okay?

1076
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,069
With a paper trail as long as this one,
this was bound to happen.

1077
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,913
This is usually how these
things work out.

1078
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,358
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1079
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,759
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't apologise.

1080
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,239
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1081
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,072
No, no apology necessary.

1082
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,952
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, Doug.

1083
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,268
I didn't mean to do anything.

1084
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,675
It's all right. It's all over now.

1085
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,354
It's okay.

1086
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,035
What, what, what are
they doing here?

1087
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,395
Well now, Doug, they're here
to take away the body.

1088
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,553
What do you mean, body?
What do you mean?

1089
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,629
Well, you know...

1090
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,948
- How the fuck?
- He probably...

1091
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,678
How the fuck did he get
here from his house?

1092
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,358
Doug, listen.
He panicked, okay?

1093
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,670
Being as how there weren't
any doctor's offices nearby,

1094
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,954
he did the next best
thing he could.

1095
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,112
He came here, okay?
So this is where he expired.

1096
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,995
Are you okay, Doug?
Are you okay?

1097
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,229
Hey, Mr Varney,
you cannot go back there.

1098
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,639
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!

1099
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,597
Mr Varney, no, no, no, no, no.

1100
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,957
What the fuck?

1101
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,753
What the fuck?

1102
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,513
Now listen,
he was no angel, okay?

1103
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,589
Poor kid, he really got in
over his head with this one.

1104
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,948
With what?

1105
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,510
Well, with pilfering.
You know?

1106
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,671
Pill skimming.

1107
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:26,271
You know? A couple here, two more there,
a couple three more there.

1108
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,113
That sort of thing adds up in a hurry,
sometimes too quick.

1109
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,988
You know, you don't know this,

1110
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,039
but there's a real cottage industry out
here in the burbs for this kind of thing.

1111
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,432
Noah was a resourceful criminal, but he
forgot the first rule of the drug game.

1112
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,869
Don't get high on your own supply.

1113
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,029
It's a shame.

1114
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,351
Good-looking kid.
Great head of hair.

1115
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,472
So that's...
So that's it, then?

1116
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,151
I have some paperwork for you to sign,
but then we're done.

1117
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,153
Listen, Mr Varney.

1118
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,232
Doug, I know that this is rough, okay?

1119
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,998
Quite a shock, but there's nothing that
you could have done to stop it, okay?

1120
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,636
Hey, from the looks of things,

1121
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,438
you ought to prescribe
yourself a little something.

1122
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,154
Hey, that is not
appropriate, Officer.

1123
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,599
Local cops, right?

1124
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,915
He's right, though,

1125
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,913
Mr Varney. Go ahead.
It'll be our little secret.

1126
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,193
You take care, now.

1127
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,839
Agent Carp, Agent Carp.

1128
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,555
- I'll be right back, Doug.
- I need to... I need to talk to you.

1129
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,312
I need to...

1130
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,039
Hello! Anybody here?
I need some aspirin!

1131
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,634
Hey!

1132
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,355
My drinking buddy!

1133
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,475
You're not supposed to be here.

1134
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,549
He's right.

1135
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,790
- I'm gonna have to ask you
to clear out. - No, it's all right.

1136
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,717
You...

1137
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,069
You...

1138
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:58,838
Last night after we had the drinks at
the bar, I took the... I took the party home

1139
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,716
by myself and I drank
a half a bottle of Black Label.

1140
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,480
I passed out cold right
there on the chair.

1141
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,271
My head's killing me.
Do you have...

1142
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,148
Huh? Oh! Yeah.

1143
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,517
Thanks. Okay.

1144
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,833
I should probably...
Should pick up a prescription.

1145
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,196
My prescriptions because the delivery
guy never made it up to the house.

1146
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,357
All... A lot of orders got screwed up.

1147
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,477
I'll fill it out and have someone
run it over to you later.

1148
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,596
- What do I owe you?
- Call it even.

1149
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,793
For the drinks.

1150
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,552
All right. Good seeing you, Doug.
Thanks.

1151
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,353
Hey, is everything else okay?

1152
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,549
What do you mean?

1153
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,030
Well, you know, with your wife,
what you were telling me at the bar.

1154
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,189
Oh...

1155
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,076
I don't know.
She left me.

1156
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,150
She left? And she's
not coming back?

1157
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,353
I don't know. She even
turned off her cell phone.

1158
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,590
I think this time
she really means it.

1159
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,398
All right, Doug. Thanks.

1160
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,429
Doug?

1161
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,357
You wanted to talk to me?

1162
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,035
Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks
for all your help.

1163
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,432
- Sure thing.
- You're good.

1164
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,553
Thanks. You're good, too.

1165
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,879
We all do our part to
keep the world turning.

1166
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,837
You take care of yourself now, Doug.

1167
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,158
Hell of a day, huh,
Varney?

1168
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,472
Fuck.

1169
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,075
Okay.

1170
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,149
Hello?

1171
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,789
Hey, baby.

1172
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,279
Elizabeth, where the...

1173
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,793
- You didn't answer your calls.
- Yeah,

1174
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,757
that was the plan, remember?
No calls.

1175
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,597
Yeah, well, the plan has changed.
Jack isn't dead.

1176
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,314
Jack isn't dead.

1177
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,469
What?

1178
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,438
There was a screw-up with
the deliveries and Noah...

1179
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,670
It's complicated.
I can't get into it.

1180
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:42,755
Elizabeth?

1181
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,830
Bonnie and Clyde, we are not.

1182
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,469
It's not too late, though, right?

1183
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,039
I mean,

1184
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,237
we could still go away.

1185
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,154
We could just...
We could go away.

1186
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,795
I have a kid, Elizabeth.
I can't leave.

1187
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,837
God.

1188
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,597
I was worried sick.

1189
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,352
Yeah, I'm fine.

1190
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,158
I meant this.

1191
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,629
Oh.

1192
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,633
You were right.
I guess I've just been a little bit

1193
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:19,191
caught up in, you know,
Ethan's drama and the studio.

1194
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,391
But you're home now.

1195
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,152
So that's what's important.

1196
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,399
Kara, that letter wasn't me
asking you to change.

1197
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,790
It was me telling you
that I'm leaving.

1198
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,915
Whoo!
Yeah!

1199
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,752
That's what I'm
talking about! Yes!

1200
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,752
You made it. All right.
Congratulations.

1201
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,676
Good morning, Doug.

1202
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,591
I brought you some coffee
just the way you like it.

1203
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,434
Oh, no, thanks, Walt. I'm off caffeine.
I appreciate it, though.

1204
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,195
Oh.

1205
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,836
You know, it's funny. I don't hate it
nearly as much as I thought I would.

1206
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,600
That's funny.
I don't really give a shit.

1207
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,799
Like I said, things don't
change much in Woodbury,

1208
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,233
but every now and then,

1209
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,595
we need to be reminded
that change can be good.

1210
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,392
The pharmacy had
a whole new look,

1211
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,790
and I wanted to see it for myself.

1212
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,518
Ma'am, are you finding
everything all right?

1213
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,589
Yes. Yes, I am.

1214
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,228
And may I say this pharmacy

1215
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,598
has the most impressive collection
of douches I have ever seen.

1216
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,869
Well, thank you.

1217
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,633
High blood pressure, acid reflux,

1218
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,399
chlamydia.

1219
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,874
Never would have guessed.

1220
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,313
No one ever does.

1221
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,909
Excuse me.

1222
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,589
Oh, hey.

1223
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,712
I thought you were out of town.

1224
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,473
I had to come back to sign some papers.
You know, make it final.

1225
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,598
And I had a few things I absolutely
needed to pick up from the pharmacy.

1226
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,910
Just to complete the collection

1227
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,749
for the kingdom.

1228
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,399
So, are you in town long or...

1229
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,790
No, I leave tonight for Madrid,
and then Paris

1230
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,558
and then I don't really know.
I'm not sure.

1231
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,757
I don't care, as long as I don't
understand the menu, you know?

1232
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,997
Well, hey, that sounds great.

1233
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,949
It sounds like you'll have a great...

1234
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,516
You can't help everyone,
but everyone can help someone.

1235
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,395
Take care of yourself, Doug.

1236
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,597
And sometimes,
that someone is yourself.

1237
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,159
You, too.

1238
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,558
Doug Varney wasn't
used to winning.

1239
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,359
But he was beginning
to enjoy how it felt.

1240
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,799
Consult!
