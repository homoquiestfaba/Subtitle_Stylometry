Like a virgin?

10
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,554
Touched for the very first time.

11
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,558
[laughs]

12
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,062
Well, I always thought Jesus was black.

13
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,564
[laughter]

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,111
MAN: One more time.

15
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,813
I was just about to call you.

16
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,548
Traffic.

17
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,084
Uh, did you write that letter
of recommendation for me?

18
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,318
You're making a big mistake.

19
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,587
I don't want to leave.

20
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,356
It's just, uh, time for
something different.

21
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,560
Tell you what... you make
these passengers happy,

22
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,295
I'll make you a glowing recommendation

23
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,797
when you get back.

24
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,799
I always make them happy.

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,103
Don't let me down, now.

26
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,805
Have I ever?

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,809
[car beeping]

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
One more time.

29
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,322
Grandma?

30
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,290
Didn't I tell you he was just adorable?

31
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,558
You are going on this trip?

32
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,093
You know, when he was just yea high

33
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,096
he used to take his dog all
around the neighborhood,

34
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,064
giving them tours.

35
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,565
Oh! [laughs]

36
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,534
Your mother told me
this was your last tour.

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,303
And I just couldn't
miss it for the world.

38
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,072
[stutter] I can't...

39
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,574
It's this or I stay home and
watch the Weather Channel.

40
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,810
Now, you just go ahead
and do what you're doing.

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,546
I will sit right here
and be quiet as a mouse.

42
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,314
You don't want to do this.

43
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,049
Of course I do!

44
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,052
The girls and I are already
becoming best friends.

45
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,320
Is it hot in here?

46
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,088
Yeah.

47
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,088
Yes.

48
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:38,275
It is.

49
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,294
Good morning, starlets, celebrities,

50
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,562
and Hollywood legends.

51
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:50,068
On behalf of your professional driver,

52
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:56,308
who will introduce himself
later, and myself, Aaron

53
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,544
"I've Seen it All" Morgan...

54
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,813
"I've Seen it All" Morgan...
Isn't that precious?

55
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,316
You would never know he
was raised in the church.

56
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,551
Oh.

57
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,821
Welcome aboard Texas Tinseltown Tours!

58
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,090
[cheering]

59
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,294
As your host, Aaron, I
will personally guide you

60
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,830
into a fantasy voyage
exploring the exciting world

61
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,798
of show business.

62
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,833
I am so excited.

63
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:26,838
Yes, this evening you will
find a hidden jewel of Texas

64
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:32,811
deep in Big Bend County, land
of outlaws and desperados,

65
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,314
as I guide you passed rattlesnakes

66
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,283
and killer tarantulas onto the sights

67
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,785
of several movie pictures.

68
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,787
When he was in school,
he was Curly in the play.

69
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,088
Aw.

70
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,391
He was so good, just
like he was on Broadway.

71
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,059
AARON: Grammy.

72
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,364
Now, just go ahead and
do what you're doing.

73
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,300
As your fearless leader, I will take you

74
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,070
to relive some of the
famous shootouts in movies

75
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,572
such as "Rio Diablo"...

76
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,807
WOMAN: Oh, I saw that.

77
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,809
And who can forget that famous movie

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,547
with the dirty deeds of Willie
"Pass Me Another Joint" Nelson.

79
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,548
Willie is my hero.

80
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,049
I just love his songs.

81
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,819
I saw him walking down
the street one time.

82
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,554
I was just coming out of the store,

83
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,557
and I was looking to see if it
was safe to cross the street,

84
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,828
and there he was... pigtails,
bandana, everything.

85
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,062
[cooing]

86
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,565
If I had walked out of that
store 10 seconds earlier,

87
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,300
I would've bumped right into him.

88
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,302
Aw!

89
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,803
Grammy.

90
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:37,075
You know, old people talk so
much because we have lived.

91
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,311
And to top it off
tonight, we'll be staying

92
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,315
at the Contrabando Guest Ranch,
sleeping on the bed sheets

93
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,549
of the stars. [tongue click]

94
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,785
I hope they've washed them since then.

95
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,552
Mhm.

96
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,561
We can go now.

97
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,808
[salsa music playing]

98
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:20,285
WOMEN: (CHANTING)
Barbarossa, Barbarossa,

99
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,789
Barbarossa, Barbarossa!

100
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,792
[cheering]

101
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,297
AARON: Did you just hire on?

102
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,098
DRIVER: Yeah.

103
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,305
AARON: So why did
you take this job?

104
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,307
DRIVER: The money.

105
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,542
AARON: I hear you.

106
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,544
You think you're gonna stay with it?

107
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,046
DRIVER: Whatever.

108
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,782
AARON: Well, this
is my last rodeo.

109
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,285
DRIVER: [scoff] Yeah,
your... your granny

110
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,820
told us all about it.

111
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,328
AARON: Remember, ladies,
we have a schedule to keep.

112
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,331
I like to take my time.

113
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,534
Well, don't take too long,
'cause I've got to go.

114
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,069
You're doing a great job, honey.

115
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,312
DRIVER: Nice perfume.

116
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,847
Oh, do you like it?

117
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,548
It's called Summer Rain.

118
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,784
It smells like you got soaked.

119
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,787
Uh, did you realize that
that mountain range over there

120
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,055
in the distance, it's the same mountain

121
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,324
range used in John
Ford's classic Western,

122
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,825
"How the West was Won"?

123
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,094
WOMAN: They shot that in Utah.

124
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,798
No, it was an establishing
shot early in the movie.

125
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,534
Look at that mountain range over there.

126
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,069
Hey, that was real smooth.

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,070
This van stinks.

128
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,072
Yeah, well, get used to it.

129
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,549
You know, smoking will kill you.

130
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,552
Well, I like to live on the edge.

131
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,089
[highway noise]

132
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,310
You been to the bars downtown yet?

133
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,311
No.

134
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,317
My name is Aaron.

135
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,056
DRIVER: Yeah, I heard.

136
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,291
And your name is?

137
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,296
Jesse.

138
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,564
AARON: Jesse.

139
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,066
Funny, you don't look like a Jesse.

140
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,535
It's Jesus.

141
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,305
Shouldn't your nickname be "Hese"?

142
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,539
Fuck you.

143
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Trying.

144
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,309
Is it hot, or is it just me?

145
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,578
I'll turn up the air conditioner.

146
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,812
It's going full blast.

147
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,314
Why don't you tell them to take off

148
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,315
some of those stupid costumes.

149
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,083
It's the way this tour works.

150
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,287
They dress like movie stars and
we treat them like movie stars.

151
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,290
You're gonna love it.

152
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,294
[salsa music playing]

153
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,313
That's strange.

154
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,823
Why the stop?

155
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,325
AGENT: New driver?

156
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,059
Yeah.

157
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:56,568
Uh, Jimmy got drunk last week
in Mexico and disappeared.

158
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,303
So what's up?

159
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,541
Trouble on the border...
Just warning folks.

160
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,810
[sniffs] You smell purty.

161
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,846
Yeah, and I think I laughed when

162
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,080
you said that last November.

163
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:13,785
Oh, hello.

164
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,320
Hello, Officer.

165
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,555
Officer!

166
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,822
Hello, ladies.

167
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,558
WOMAN: Can we get some
[inaudible]? [laughs]

168
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,561
Now, you'll all be perfectly
safe at the guest ranch

169
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,062
tonight.

170
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,564
But just be sure, I want you
to keep your doors locked

171
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,300
and don't let anybody
in... unless, of course,

172
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,801
I come by to check on you.

173
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,304
That would be nice.

174
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,539
What about you?

175
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,541
I'm Aaron's grandmother.

176
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,576
She's with me.

177
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,543
Oh, really?

178
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,813
Uh, hey, nice to meet you, ma'am.

179
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:46,051
You didn't tell me
Grandma was riding today.

180
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,552
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,791
Maybe coming by the
ranch house later tonight,

182
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,826
unless Grandma's gonna be watching.

183
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,562
You know, why don't you
bang on some cabin doors

184
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,563
and see what it get you?

185
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,831
Oh, I'll be banging all right.

186
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,100
It won't be on doors.

187
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,835
Whatever will your wife say?

188
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,539
Hey, I'm only married when I'm home.

189
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,541
Let's go.

190
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,076
[engine starting]

191
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:15,547
[salsa music playing]

192
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,102
Hello, ladies!

193
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,537
Welcome to the guest ranch of the stars,

194
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,806
our little oasis in the desert.

195
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,074
How quaint.

196
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,343
GRAMMY: Thank you so much.

197
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,313
Oh, y'all are dress up cute. [laughs]

198
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,816
Just smell this clean air.

199
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,084
[sniff] [sigh]

200
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,320
I am just burning up.

201
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,789
They better have air
conditioning in this place.

202
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,324
Thank you, Aaron.

203
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,558
Oh, you're welcome.

204
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,560
Fasten your seat belts, fellows.

205
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,863
It's gonna be a bumpy night.

206
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,065
Well, I'll see you at breakfast.

207
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,534
You know, you have
such fun on this tour.

208
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,538
Are you sure that you want to
go to work for that cruise line?

209
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,839
It's a better job.

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,308
But you'll go to so
many dangerous places.

211
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,811
I hear stories all the
time about pirates.

212
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,813
[laughs] Grammy.

213
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,349
There's no pirates in Hawaii.

214
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,117
I worry about you.

215
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,053
Your life hasn't been so easy.

216
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,289
There will be an investigation.

217
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,057
That's true.

218
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,062
If anything should happen to you,

219
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,065
it would just break my heart.

220
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,068
I can take care of myself.

221
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,071
I know you can.

222
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,307
Get some rest, and I'll
see you in the morning.

223
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,308
All right.

224
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,310
Mwah.

225
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,311
Love you.

226
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,312
GRAMMY: Love you.

227
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,123
Aw, so sweet.

228
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,791
I didn't know she was coming.

229
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,626
Relax.

230
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,796
I got a grandma, too.

231
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,065
Hey, uh, listen.

232
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,102
Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

233
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,071
Maybe after dinner, I could take
you to the local watering hole.

234
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,574
I don't think that's a very good idea.

235
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,108
Come on.

236
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,808
I'll buy you a beer.

237
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,311
No.

238
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,814
In fact, I think you better
stay in your room tonight.

239
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,082
No, my boss is cool with it.

240
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,284
I'm, like, his favorite tour guide.

241
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,787
I didn't think he liked gay guys.

242
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,289
Hey, look, asshole, I don't
need this shit from you.

243
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,090
Chill out.

244
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,091
Jesus.

245
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,060
Oh, I thought it was "Haysus."

246
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,294
Who's being the asshole here?

247
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,798
You know, forget I even invited you.

248
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,800
Why would I want to have a
drink with someone like you?

249
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,335
Just stay in your room.

250
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,804
If you're worried about it, I'm not

251
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,072
gonna be knocking on your door.

252
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,114
[crinkling]

253
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,253
Four hours, 3:45.

254
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,064
Hi, this is Aaron Morgan
calling for Debbie.

255
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,265
Thank you.

256
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,269
Debbie, hi.

257
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,271
It's Aaron Morgan calling again.

258
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,772
Yeah.

259
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,075
Listen, my boss is gonna send
that letter of recommendation.

260
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,010
And yeah, things are going great.

261
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,044
Uh-huh, yeah.

262
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,780
I've... I've quit smoking.

263
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,548
Uh-huh.

264
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,787
Yeah.

265
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,289
Well, I... I talked to him this morning.

266
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,523
He's gonna send it.

267
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,259
[sigh] I mean, look.

268
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,061
Can you make a little
exception for... just this once?

269
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:04,535
No, I'm not asking special
favors, but... I know,

270
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,337
but he's been really busy.

271
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,275
OK.

272
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,510
But you know, I could be
there whenever you needed me.

273
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,547
Like, hell, I could do
there Monday, you know.

274
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,515
All right.

275
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,023
Uh-huh.

276
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,295
Thank you.

277
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,829
Yeah, have a good night.

278
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,501
[phone snaps shut]

279
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,263
Could you do just a
special favor for me?

280
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,297
WOMAN: There will
be an investigation.

281
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,799
MAN: You're making
a big mistake.

282
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,767
If you resign, we could
forget the whole matter.

283
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:13,771
They know you were a fag?

284
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,782
[tense music playing]

285
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,517
[thud]

286
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,522
[thud]

287
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:08,546
[knocking]

288
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,254
What's up?

289
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,054
Hey.

290
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,282
What's the matter?

291
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,783
I don't want to do this.

292
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,022
What do you mean?

293
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,756
I need a beer.

294
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,028
I'll get you a 12-pack.

295
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,029
No, let's go to the bar.

296
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,030
Uh-uh, I can't.

297
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,264
My sister-in-law's out tonight.

298
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,033
If she sees me, I'll be in deep shit.

299
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,771
You should tell your wife.

300
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,274
She knows.

301
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,079
She knows she doesn't need to know.

302
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,256
Hey, take a shower before I get back.

303
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,791
You smell like an old lady.

304
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,759
Yeah, well, the old
ladies might hear you.

305
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,061
Pssh.

306
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,764
They couldn't hear gunfire
if it was outside their door.

307
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:34,799
You know what?

308
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,769
I might not be awake when you get back.

309
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,504
You'll wake up for this.

310
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,530
[shower running]

311
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,065
Heh.

312
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,033
Closet case.

313
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Will you tutor me after school?

314
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,055
We could forget the whole matter.

315
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,030
[tense music playing]

316
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,029
You're it, kid.

317
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,062
Can you beat that?

318
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,281
MAN: (STERNLY) Take care of it.

319
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,265
Why does this guy get half my cut, Tom?

320
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,266
Don't call me that.

321
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,575
He killed him.

322
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,276
You were supposed to be on the lookout.

323
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,779
And what were you doing?

324
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,749
Just a little "Risky Business."

325
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,285
Don't push me.

326
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,253
Hey.

327
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,289
What's going on here?

328
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,291
[fighting sounds]

329
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,559
Stop.

330
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,528
God damn you!

331
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,530
Get the fuck off of me!

332
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,532
I didn't do anything.

333
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,500
[grunting]

334
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,767
Idiot.

335
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,502
Ow!

336
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,504
You're distracting me.

337
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,041
I told you to stay in your room.

338
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:15,279
[phone ringing]

339
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,523
Yeah.

340
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,258
We got a problem, boss.

341
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,026
Yeah.

342
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,794
Your tour guide saw everything.

343
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,265
Take care of it.

344
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,302
Take care of it.

345
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,503
Did he say that?

346
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,272
Take care of it!

347
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,039
I got it.

348
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,278
JESSE: Not here.

349
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,547
You're gonna wake everyone up.

350
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,781
[grunt]

351
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,283
JESSE: I'll do it.

352
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,824
Just have this shit done
by the time I get back.

353
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,261
[cough] Ah.

354
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,767
[groan]

355
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,505
[groan]

356
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,521
[panting]

357
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,522
JESSE: What'd you
see back there?

358
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,523
I didn't see anything.

359
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,257
JESSE: What did you see?

360
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,559
I didn't see anything!

361
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,028
You're gonna have to get
lost, disappear, you hear me?

362
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,763
You call the cops,
you're dead, all right?

363
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,264
Please don't kill me.

364
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,032
I can't harm you.

365
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:15,799
I'm just a tour guide.

366
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,534
Please don't kill me.

367
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,782
[leaves rustling]

368
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,519
[panting]

369
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,802
[phone ringing]

370
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,270
WOMAN (ON PHONE): [inaudible].

371
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,806
These guys, they tried to kill me.

372
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,053
It's done.

373
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:14,251
[soft conversation]

374
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,537
What did the park ranger want?

375
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,271
Nothing.

376
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,272
Bullshit.

377
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,077
He was looking for the kid.

378
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,548
[sigh] I think he
wanted sex or something.

379
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:22,052
I told him he was out drinking
with the Border Patrol guy.

380
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,520
You took care of him?

381
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,755
Yeah, what'd I tell you?

382
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,790
Look, you're gonna need
to get out of here.

383
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,525
Where did you dump the body?

384
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,259
Across the river.

385
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,294
Chill.

386
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,530
I'm going to bed.

387
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,768
It's cool, all right?

388
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:55,519
[phone ringing]

389
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,521
Yeah.

390
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,257
We took care of it.

391
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,758
But there's something else.

392
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,261
Yeah?

393
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,796
I'll call you back.

394
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,766
23% of all accidents last year
were due to cell phone use.

395
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,036
There was a study conducted
on the use of handheld phones

396
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,506
to see if they were any
safer, but the results

397
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,774
are inconclusive.

398
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,777
Most analysts believe that
the actual act of talking

399
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,047
on that cell phone is more
distracting to the driver

400
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,049
than conversations in the car.

401
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,050
[thud]

402
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,784
[scream]

403
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:28,752
[tires squealing]

404
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,020
Did you hit it?

405
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,288
I think you hit it.

406
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,522
It's just a deer.

407
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,026
Texas deer accounted
for 18% of the accidents.

408
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,794
Though not fatal, the most dangerous

409
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,530
collision you could have with
an animal is the boar hog.

410
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,532
And that's because when
the vehicle hits it,

411
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,070
it flips over it, and it will
kill the people in the vehicle.

412
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,507
It's not surprising that Aaron
was intoxicated on the job.

413
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,510
In a recent survey conducted
by the Mannon Corporation,

414
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:58,282
alcoholism contributes to
38% of job absenteeism.

415
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,250
That is very prevalent
in industries that

416
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,520
have unusual hours and the shift work

417
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,822
and all the things
that contribute to the,

418
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,259
you know... just mess up
your circadian rhythm.

419
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
I need some coffee.

420
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,044
(WHISPERING) God, I'm
gonna kill this woman

421
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,046
if she doesn't shut up.

422
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,514
Jesus Christ.

423
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,522
[phone ringing]

424
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,029
Yeah, we may have a problem.

425
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,798
Take care of it.

426
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:02,279
[phone ringing]

427
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:05,549
Yeah.

428
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,088
Yeah, we took care of it.

429
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,766
[gun clicking]

430
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,519
Look, either you take
care of it, or I will.

431
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,794
He hung up.

432
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,529
Well, what did he say?

433
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,533
He said we better
take of it, or he will.

434
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,768
Shit.

435
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,037
MAN: Did... did he say that?

436
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,271
MAN: Ah, fuck.

437
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,040
Where's that van driver?

438
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,274
In his room.

439
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,275
I've been watching him.

440
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:09,046
Get him to show you the body.

441
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,784
[music playing]

442
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:39,042
Yeah, I called about the
guys hijacking my van.

443
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,278
No, I haven't been drinking.

444
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,782
You... no, this isn't a prank!

445
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,518
You have to listen to me.

446
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,252
Hello?

447
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
We could forget...

448
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,756
The only way you are going to pass...

449
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,024
Special favor for me?

450
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,325
There will be an investigation.

451
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,259
MAN: You're making
a big mistake, son.

452
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,527
What are you doing after school?

453
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,763
What is going on in your
classroom, Mr. Morgan?

454
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,531
How old are you?

455
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:09,039
I just called about the
guys hijacking my van.

456
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,541
This is not a prank!

457
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,281
God dammit!

458
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,251
[owl hooting]

459
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,767
[clinking]

460
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,273
[knocking]

461
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,775
Open up!

462
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,757
This is bullshit.

463
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,032
[twigs snapping]

464
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:04,521
Aaron.

465
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,033
Aaron.

466
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,505
Aaron.

467
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,510
Aaron!

468
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,045
Where are you?

469
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,751
[twigs snapping]

470
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,552
Aaron.

471
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,523
Aaron!

472
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,034
Aaron.

473
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,050
[gunshot]

474
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,552
Fuck.

475
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,266
I told you not to call the cops.

476
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,534
Ow.

477
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,535
I told you not to call the cops.

478
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,070
I did, so fuck you!

479
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,774
You're not gonna get away
with whatever you're doing.

480
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,267
Hold it right there!

481
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,036
Drop that weapon now!

482
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:11,781
Hey, Martin, you're Tom Cruise.

483
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,550
[laughs]

484
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:17,287
AGENT: Wow, I'm, uh...
Look at you, man.

485
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,254
[laughs] Yeah.

486
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,023
Man, my wife's crazy about you.

487
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,057
Oh, really?

488
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,258
Although, man, I really don't know what

489
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,260
she sees in someone so short.

490
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,528
Man, what are you guys doing?

491
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,296
You filming around here?

492
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,263
I, uh...

493
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,765
Man, I hadn't heard nothing.

494
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,301
I, uh... I can't really...
[awkward laugh] I

495
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,535
can't really say.

496
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,536
Oh, I get it.

497
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,504
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,538
Top secret, man.

499
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,574
Hey, I won't say a thing.

500
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,509
Oh, thanks.

501
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,278
[grunting]

502
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,251
Don't let anyone near the van.

503
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,266
JESSE: This is a
sting, you asshole.

504
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,767
What, so you're a narc?

505
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,269
JESSE: Oh, that's good
police work, Luke.

506
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,537
Fuck, yes I'm a narc.

507
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,772
So I did you a favor.

508
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,274
I called the cops.

509
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,775
You probably blew my cover.

510
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,278
Those assholes back there
and worthless to me.

511
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,513
I need to catch the boss with
his hands on the shit for this

512
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,782
to work.

513
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,551
The bus wasn't even
supposed to go down 'til

514
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,552
the van got back to Austin.

515
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,786
Yeah, well, you should have told me.

516
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,288
How was I supposed to know?

517
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,756
You didn't need to know.

518
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,257
Uh, maybe I did.

519
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,773
You would have blown my cover.

520
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:21,511
So you didn't tell me, but
I blow your cover anyways.

521
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,779
Oh, that's brilliant.

522
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,281
I want to work where you work.

523
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,784
Didn't somebody once say
the Central Intelligence

524
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,553
Agency is an oxymoron?

525
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,521
JESSE: George Carlin said that.

526
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,522
And that was the CIA.

527
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,556
I'm the DEA.

528
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,763
We're the good guys.

529
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,265
Come on.

530
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,299
No.

531
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,236
No, the good guys don't
kick me in the stomach.

532
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,241
I had to do that.

533
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,979
You would've blown my cover.

534
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,218
Where the fuck are you going?

535
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,520
To the ranch.

536
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,988
You can't go back there.

537
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,489
Stop me, narc.

538
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:07,490
You're dead.

539
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,225
Still walking.

540
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,728
You go back there, they'll
kill you on the spot.

541
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,998
Look, I'm not staying here, OK?

542
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,499
I'm going back to the ranch, where

543
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,001
I'll get my grandmother and her friends,

544
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,004
and we're getting out of here.

545
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,005
I can't let you do that.

546
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,241
What?

547
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,743
Come on.

548
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,244
Shoot the homo.

549
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:40,223
I'll send an agent in the morning.

550
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,725
Right.

551
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,260
I believe you.

552
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,734
JESSE: Would you at
least stay off the road?

553
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,036
Am I on the road?

554
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:53,770
No.

555
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,238
[snake rattling]

556
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,506
Hey, freeze.

557
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,008
Don't... don't move.

558
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,015
Whoa, whoa.

559
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,991
It's three feet in front of you.

560
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,229
Get back.

561
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,001
What are you doing?

562
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,002
Get back.

563
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,278
Whoa!

564
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:36,479
Oh!

565
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,513
Ow!

566
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,481
Fuck.

567
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,483
Ah.

568
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:41,484
JESSE: Where's it at?

569
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,485
It's not a snake bite.

570
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,487
It's probably just a scorpion.

571
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,070
Keep the lights turned off.

572
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,250
Will you tutor me after school?

573
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,754
What was going on in your
classroom, Mr. Morgan?

574
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,722
After school?

575
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,224
MAN: You're making
a big mistake, son.

576
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,729
JESSE: I told you to
stay off the road.

577
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,031
Not listening.

578
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,002
You are not gonna
fuck this op up for me.

579
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,038
Fuck you.

580
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,773
That's what it is, isn't it?

581
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,042
You want to, don't you?

582
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,043
Yeah.

583
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:40,777
Yeah, I did.

584
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,011
I thought you were hot.

585
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,013
How do you like that, motherfucker, huh?

586
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,482
The fag wanted to fuck the van driver.

587
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,017
Woohoo, first time in history a fag

588
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,752
thought a straight guy
would be a good fuck.

589
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,988
Who are you calling the motherfucker?

590
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,256
You.

591
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,724
You think you can kill
me 'cause I'm a fag

592
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,025
and it wouldn't matter.

593
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,494
Man, this whole "I'm gay, therefore

594
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,731
"I'm a victim" act of yours, it's
the biggest turn-off for me.

595
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:02,999
I don't understand.

596
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,068
JESSE: Are you fucking serious?

597
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,482
You did that to shut me up.

598
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,990
No hope for that.

599
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,720
[speaking Spanish] Arriba.

600
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,256
Hey.

601
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,257
[gunshot]

602
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:24,507
[ominous music playing]

603
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,791
[rock clattering]

604
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,493
Ah, shit!

605
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,228
Oh, gah.

606
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,498
Ah!

607
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:22,999
Oh.

608
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,467
Oh, my god.

609
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:25,234
Oh.

610
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,012
[gunshots]

611
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,247
[grunt] [gasp]

612
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,236
[gasp]

613
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,240
[gun clicking]

614
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,242
You know how to use this thing?

615
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,244
Point and shoot.

616
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,478
Fuck, we are dead.

617
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,014
Not without taking them down with me.

618
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,482
Not at me, all right?

619
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,485
Hotwire this thing
and get us out of here.

620
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,987
We hotwire it, the
steering's gonna lock up,

621
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,490
and we drive off a cliff.

622
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,259
Look, I can tell you
the guy with the gun

623
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,227
"is 5 foot 7" and a lousy shot.

624
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,495
The best place to find a drug smuggler

625
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,763
is on the Mexican border.

626
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:29,031
And I can run flat out for two minutes

627
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,234
before dropping from a heart attack.

628
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,004
What kind of man knows
those things, huh?

629
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,238
Fuck.

630
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,508
You've seen way too
many Matt Damon movies.

631
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,245
Well, he is cute.

632
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:47,750
But... but why were they using
my van to smuggle drugs?

633
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,721
The perfume on those
broads throws the dogs off.

634
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,724
It's the only way to
get past the border.

635
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,258
And how do you know this?

636
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,727
Your boss smuggles more drugs than they

637
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,228
can make in South America?

638
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,496
My boss is in on this?

639
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:01,998
Yeah, your boss.

640
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,032
My boss?

641
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,500
Your boss, your tour van.

642
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,737
They use these bozos to help them.

643
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:09,739
[gasping]

644
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,274
[gunshots]

645
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,745
[gunfire]

646
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,747
I think I hit him.

647
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,720
What... what if I killed him?

648
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,490
You didn't kill him.

649
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,993
I... I... I never killed
anything in my life before.

650
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,496
I mean, when... when my dad put
my dog down, I cried for, like,

651
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,730
three weeks.

652
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,732
Do you think I killed him?

653
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:37,500
You didn't even hit him.

654
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,502
I got him.

655
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,503
Oh.

656
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,004
Oh, you think I couldn't
have gotten him?

657
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,005
No.

658
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:44,240
No, I'm... I'm sure I hit him.

659
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,508
Fine. You hit him.

660
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:46,475
You got him. You killed him.

661
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,245
He's dead.

662
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,747
Do... do you really think he's dead?

663
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,750
I mean, what if he is dead?

664
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,519
What if you were dead?

665
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,757
Good point.

666
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:06,495
[gunshots]

667
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,250
He's dead.

668
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,218
Jesus.

669
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,495
[door slamming]

670
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:53,742
I'll make sure someone
finds him in the morning.

671
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,479
Yeah, well, we should
have gotten the keys.

672
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,481
We have to leave this truck here.

673
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,482
We can't just leave him here.

674
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,749
JESSE: What are you gonna do?

675
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,517
Take him to the sheriff?

676
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,718
Hey, I found this dead guy.

677
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,986
I thought I'd just bring him to you.

678
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,488
Oh, and by the way, here's his gun.

679
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,223
I fired it a few times,
but I swear not at him.

680
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,024
He's not just some dead guy.

681
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,227
JESSE: That's not gonna make
you seem any less guilty.

682
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,528
God.

683
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,762
JESSE: We go back to
the ranch in this truck,

684
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,997
the dumbass is gonna know we knocked off

685
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:19,001
his brute and Julie back there.

686
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,237
Your boss must know you're
dead by now, which means he's

687
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,240
sending a replacement
tour guide as we speak,

688
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,242
just like he sent a driver.

689
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,744
What's he gonna do if you show up?

690
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,015
In the morning, I'm gonna take the van

691
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,250
back and finish this tour.

692
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,752
And then I'll bust his ass in Austin.

693
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,020
No way.

694
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:42,525
Grammy is gonna freak out
if I'm not on that van.

695
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,993
I'm going back.

696
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,473
I really like your grandson.

697
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,478
Does he know about us?

698
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:09,518
Well, Betty, we just
don't talk about it.

699
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,752
The killing doesn't bother you?

700
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,489
It's better than my last job.

701
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,758
Which was what, prison guard in Iraq?

702
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,230
Internet sex stings.

703
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,497
What?

704
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,499
You tried to catch people having sex?

705
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,769
JESSE: No, like,
uh, child molesters.

706
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,006
You know that you're interfering
with a federal investigation

707
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:04,807
here.

708
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,008
You're not stopping me.

709
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,243
I need this job.

710
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,512
I thought you were quitting.

711
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,015
Well, I didn't get the job on the ship.

712
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,750
Well, I hate to break it to you,

713
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,218
but your boss is going away for a really

714
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,020
long time after this shit.

715
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,489
It's time for a new career.

716
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,491
Well, I got bills to pay.

717
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,793
Why don't you go back to teaching?

718
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,999
How'd you know about that?

719
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,766
We investigate everyone.

720
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:35,738
Great.

721
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,240
Could you do just a
special favor for me?

722
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,742
We're keeping a close eye on you.

723
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,510
What are you doing after school?

724
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,746
The only way you are
going to pass this course...

725
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,015
What was going on in your
classroom, Mr. Morgan?

726
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,750
--is if you study.

727
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,720
If you resign, we could
forget the whole matter.

728
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,757
He lied, but they believed him.

729
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,225
What'd your boyfriend think?

730
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,994
We broke up.

731
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,497
Where's your boyfriend?

732
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,498
Well, I don't have one.

733
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,233
AARON: [laugh] Imagine that.

734
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,036
Ooh, look at me, I'm a killer.

735
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,737
Who'd want to live with an
undercover narc anyways?

736
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,040
Maybe the same one who'd
want to be with a tour guide?

737
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,474
You... you know what?

738
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,510
I bet you cruise city
parks pretending to be gay.

739
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,745
And when guys cruised you
back, you arrested them?

740
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,514
You know, the problem is, you are gay.

741
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,015
I told you it was an internet sting.

742
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,483
I never worked in any parks.

743
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,485
Airport bathrooms?

744
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,722
The DA wanted busts so
he could get reelected.

745
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,490
The saps I brought in
weren't child molesters.

746
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,726
They were framed.

747
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:34,730
I ratted on the DA and lost my job.

748
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,765
And man, I worked my
ass off to get this one,

749
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,502
so you're not gonna fuck it up for me.

750
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:44,239
You are totally wound up in
this whole drug bust thing.

751
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,009
God, what a fucking control freak.

752
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,012
You know, I bet having sex with
you is like fucking a robot.

753
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,246
(ROBOT VOICE) Do it faster.

754
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,248
No, no not that fast.

755
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,249
Squeeze this nipple.

756
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,250
No, that one.

757
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,257
Try it.

758
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,016
[inaudible]

759
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,752
[laughs]

760
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,477
Oh.

761
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,745
Oh, no.

762
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,524
[gunshots]

763
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,491
[glass breaking]

764
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,494
Are you OK?

765
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,729
You OK?

766
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,057
Jungle red.

767
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,525
I don't get it.

768
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,260
The women.

769
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,495
The what?

770
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,530
The movie.

771
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,233
You must be new to this gay thing.

772
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,768
I told you I don't go to bars.

773
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:56,004
Well, we do more than
just hang out in bars.

774
00:57:56,005 --> 00:58:00,042
I've been watching parades, too.

775
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,510
[sigh]

776
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,999
[birds chirping]

777
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,239
So how'd you sleep, Marilyn?

778
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,244
Not very good without Henry
laying next to me snoring.

779
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:36,245
Come on.

780
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,246
Go to breakfast.

781
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:41,250
Who are you?

782
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,489
Um, just doing some repairs.

783
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,259
Is the van broken?

784
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,260
I... I fixed it.

785
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,561
I need my other bag.

786
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,496
Yeah, I can't let you on the van.

787
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,497
Why not?

788
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:57,232
It's not ready yet.

789
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,234
What's wrong with the van?

790
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:00,235
Uh, nothing.

791
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,771
No, I was just repairing a seat.

792
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:03,772
What's going on?

793
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,475
He won't let me on the van.

794
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,010
Why won't you let her in the van?

795
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:12,247
I will let her on the van, but not yet.

796
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,016
The van's broken.

797
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,484
What's wrong with the van?

798
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,486
Nothing is wrong with the van.

799
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,755
Then why can't I get my bag?

800
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,491
Are you supposed to be Marilyn Monroe?

801
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,226
Yes.

802
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,261
You look just like her.

803
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,030
Oh, really?

804
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:28,997
Oh, brother.

805
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,234
Hey, uh, you know, I
do impersonations, too.

806
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,002
(BAD HUMPHREY BOGART VOICE)
Of all the gin joints

807
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,771
in all the world, why did you have

808
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,240
to pick this one, sweetheart?

809
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:40,242
Who's that supposed to be?

810
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,477
Humphrey Bogart.

811
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,279
Could have fooled me.

812
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,014
Can we get on the van now?

813
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:46,782
No!

814
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,251
It's a surprise.

815
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,019
What's the surprise?

816
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,255
Look, I was trying not to tell anyone,

817
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,224
but there's a surprise
for everyone on the van.

818
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:59,494
But you can't see it
until after breakfast.

819
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,496
I feel like I'm in the third grade.

820
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,032
We'll get Aaron to let us on the van.

821
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:04,766
Where is he?

822
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,500
Probably at breakfast.

823
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,002
Come on, girls.

824
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,012
Let's go.

825
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:20,749
What are you doing?

826
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,484
He's the last one, right?

827
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,022
Well, I'll circle around the back.

828
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,992
You go get him from the side.

829
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:33,495
Then what, your boss comes
back and finds him dead?

830
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,997
We don't kill him.

831
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,733
We tie him up in my room, get
the women, get out of here.

832
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,001
[laugh]

833
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,004
Things really aren't that
simple in the real world.

834
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,979
[sirens]

835
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,247
Lower your weapons.

836
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,481
Put them down.

837
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,250
Put down your guns.

838
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,751
Thank god you're here, Officer.
These two were about to kill me.

839
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:30,752
No, he's a...
OFFICER: Shut up!

840
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:31,987
--drug smuggler.
OFFICER: Shut up!

841
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,255
Put your hands up on the van.

842
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:34,489
But he's loaded this
van with pounds of...

843
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,490
He said shut up.

844
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:36,525
OFFICER: Shut up!

845
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,726
Thank god you're here.

846
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,496
Where you going?

847
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:45,267
I just... I messed up my pants
when these two jumped me.

848
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:48,236
And I just... I got to
go to the bathroom.

849
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,237
All right.

850
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:53,008
Put your hands up there, all right?

851
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,510
Where'd you get that gun?

852
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,745
Hm?

853
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,748
That's standard Border Patrol issue.

854
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,484
Looks like we got the pair that
offend that Border Patrol agent,

855
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,251
don't it?

856
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,024
If either of you guys
move so much as a muscle,

857
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,225
I'm gonna deal with you personally.

858
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,261
You got it?

859
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,262
[door slams]

860
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:17,499
I can't... I can't believe this guy.

861
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,769
This is not happening to me.

862
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,505
Why'd you try to tell
him about the coke?

863
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:27,509
Because he's a fucking drug
dealer, and I'm a tour guide.

864
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,011
I haven't even gotten a
fucking speeding ticket before.

865
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,013
JESSE: Oh, that's
hard to believe.

866
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:36,017
I thought cops didn't like gays.

867
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,486
I'm not going to jail.

868
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,720
- Looks like you are.
- Heh.

869
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:39,488
Bullshit.

870
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,004
JESSE: Where'd you
learn to do that?

871
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,038
AARON: I saw it in a movie.

872
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,255
(SARCASTICALLY) Is it in yet?

873
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:50,725
Trust me, you'll know when it is.

874
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,249
It's bad enough you let
that drug runner go.

875
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,519
But if my boss saw you here,
you'd blow both our covers.

876
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,489
And he's been working on
this sting for six months.

877
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,493
[grunt]

878
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,015
I didn't see anything.

879
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,016
I'm just a Park Ranger.

880
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,252
Just don't sound so pathetic.

881
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,223
You're making a big mistake.

882
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,524
Heh.

883
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,261
I used to believe people
when they told me that.

884
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,498
[whimper]

885
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:39,734
[soft chatter]

886
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,506
Where's Aaron?

887
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,740
Um, who's that?

888
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,475
The tour guide.

889
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,744
Oh, he, uh, got really sick
last night and had to go home.

890
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,246
WOMAN: What's wrong with him?

891
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,048
He left last night.

892
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,016
Well, then, who's giving us the tour?

893
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,053
Are you the new tour guide?

894
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,020
Uh, no.

895
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,991
What's wrong with Aaron?

896
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:04,759
Hepatitis... very contagious.

01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,495
I'm calling your office right now

899
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,497
to get to the bottom of this.

900
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,499
Wait, uh, I'm gonna be the tour guide.

901
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:12,267
What?

902
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:15,070
You said you aren't.

903
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:18,239
Well, I meant that I'm not new.

904
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:23,011
I want to know what's happened to Aaron.

905
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,012
(BAD SOUTHERN ACCENT) Well, frankly,

906
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,082
Scarlett, I don't give a damn.

907

Clark Gable!

908
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,519
Oh, anyone could have guessed that.

910
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,727
Who's that?

[door closing]

912
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,768
I told you to watch the van.

913
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,003
Where are the others?

914
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,472
I don't know, the driver
came back with the tour guide.

915
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,740
They pulled a gun on me.

916
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,041
They're in it together.

917
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,509
And then a park ranger showed up.

918
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,010
Jesus!

919
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,244
No, no, but it's OK.

920
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,245
The ranger arrested them.

921
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,016
Why didn't you shoot them?

922
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,751
I... I don't have a gun.

923
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:06,755
Good morning, ladies.

924
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,523
Isn't it a beautiful day?

925
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,992
I hope all of you had a good
night's sleep last night,

926
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,495
'cause we have a big day ahead of us.

927
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:19,501
And who are you supposed to be?

928
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,236
Esther Williams.

929
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,471
And who are you, June Cleaver?

930
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,740
[laughs]

931
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,309
Polly, Polly Brainard.

932
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,247
I am going to be your tour guide
for the remainder of this tour.

933
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:35,016
But I thought he was the new tour guide.

934
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:36,518
Where's Aaron?

935
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:40,255
It's a shame to have a drinking
problem at such a young age.

936
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,257
Aaron has a drinking problem?

937
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,059
I hope you don't mind,
but I couldn't help

938
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,762
but notice this wonderful
bottle of NSN on the van.

939
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:50,265
And I was wondering, who brought this?

940
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,735
It... I want to congratulate you
on your health consciousness.

941
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,503
Who's bottle is this?

942
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,238
Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.

943
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,507
It doesn't matter.

944
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,544
For those of you who have not
discovered the wonders of NSN,

945
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,779
this is a natural supplement that we

946
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,748
can add just a little
bit to your orange juice

947
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:10,518
in the mornings and have you
feeling wonderful the next day.

948
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:14,522
Even though this has not
been approved by the FDA yet,

949
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,257
you put a little in your
orange juice in the morning,

950
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,994
it will take care of those
achy joints and achy muscles.

951
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,529
Wouldn't you like to try some?

952
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,498
As you're beginning to
use this new product,

953
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,000
ah, it will cause some
people have that, you know,

954
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,003
extra fullness, a little bit
gas that they have... you know,

955
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,240
that occasional embarrassing
toot they have sometimes.

956
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:39,514
Would any of the rest
of you like to try it?

957
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:56,498
Where'd you get that?

958
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,233
I got this off the van.

959
01:08:58,501 --> 01:08:59,734
Have you had your NSN today?

960
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:00,768
Give me the bottle.

961
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,737
Here, let me fix you a
glass of orange juice.

962
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:05,773
(WOOZILY) Wahoo, I'm
starting to feel something.

963
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,509
This stuff is good!

964
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,245
Now, I don't think you should
be feeling it quite that fast.

965
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,279
Give me that bottle.

966
01:09:11,464 --> 01:09:13,047
Give me the bottle, lady.

967
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,016
I'm a star, not a lady.

968
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,751
Give me the bottle!

Oh, no, now.

971
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:19,988
Now, let me look at this.

972
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,290
Uh, oh, shit, where's my glasses?

973
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,291
I can't see this.

974
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,727
[gasping]

975
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,030
Give me the bottle.

976
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,765
Oh, my god.

977
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:34,002
Do you know you have a shiny head?

978
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,004
[laughter]

979

Do you know that my
ex-husband has a shiny head?

982
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,210
He's a little short down there.

Woo, I feel good.

985
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:45,980
Does everybody feel... I feel...

986
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:46,748

987
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:47,448

This is statistically impossible.

992
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,457
What?

993
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:00,195
Is the shipment on its way?

994
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,730
The old biddies found the cocaine.

995
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,000
Tell Big Mama to activate
the cruise ship plan.

996

All right, nobody moves!

a letter of recommendation

999
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,006
from you?

1002
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,215
Just like herpes.

You're getting kind of good at this.

1007
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,475
Maybe you should come work for us.

1008
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,011
And bust pot smokers?

1009
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:26,214
I don't think so.

1010
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,482
We have a lot of job security.

1011
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,484
If you don't get killed.

1012
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,722

liked living on the edge.

Ugh.

You smell good.

1019
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,483
We can still get him.

1020
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,686
He'll be halfway down the road before we

1021
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,688
could even catch up to him.

1022
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:51,726

I'm doing back here?

1029
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,718

Are you gonna shoot?

1036
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,476
Probably can't even shoot straight.

1037

But I'm not gonna get that
letter of recommendation.

1049
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:39,193
I'd write you one.

1050
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:40,995
No, it's pointless.

1051
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,200
We really are hiring.

You all know the movie
where the federal agents

are undercover and bust the
international drug dealer?

1064

As a special tribute, we have a
unique display of firearms used
