1
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:22,535
STEEL HEART

2
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,850
Thanks.

3
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:08,727
- You'll like my friends. - Nice car.

4
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:12,088
- Where are we going? - To the marina.

5
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,815
Cut it out.

6
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,536
Sindi!

7
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:44,448
Forget her, Steve. Let's go back inside.

8
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:23,415
- What is going on? - We'll meet a friend of mine.

9
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:34,686
Who is this? Let me! Richard ...

10
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,767
What is this?

11
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:36,254
Martial arts are an ideology to develop human potential.

12
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:39,369
Respect truth and justice

13
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:43,729
Respect the rights of the individual

14
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:48,374
And develop self-confidence in body and soul.

15
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,489
Martial arts codes:

16
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:55,015
1: Be loyal to your country. 2: Listen to your parents.

17
00:09:55,217 --> 00:10:00,894
3: Defend honor and justice. 4: Respect friendship.

18
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:05,295
5: Courage. He never withdraws from the fight.

19
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,816
Thank you gentlemen.

20
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:26,488
You can relax, people. Today is a special day.

21
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:31,009
Sergeant Kim is a five-year veteran of this department

22
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:35,369
He served honorably and deserves the respect of his colleagues.

23
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:41,812
His loyalty, courage and sense of responsibility are well known.

24
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:46,169
He developed a training program to fight

25
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:49,050
To better prepare our officers.

26
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:54,968
His dedication earned him respect in the Los Angeles department.

27
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:58,613
Sergeant Kim, you are valuable equipment to this department

28
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:02,935
and it is my pleasure to promote you to lieutenant. Congratulations.

29
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:07,447
Come here, John!

30
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,814
I was born and raised in Korea,

31
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:24,649
But my heart belongs to this great country. Thank you.

32
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:36,049
John, come to my office. I have something to tell you.

33
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:39,533
Your old partner is dead, John.

34
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:45,016
Good news! I got the job. I start on Sunday.

35
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:49,529
- Seriously? - Yes. I'm moving to Portland.

36
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:55,052
Portland police found him with broken arms and bullets.

37
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:06,576
He must have made one hell of a resistance.

38
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:12,647
His last task was to find missing persons, most of them young girls.

39
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,887
Gather as much information as you can.

40
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,648
If you find out what happened to the missing, you'll find out who killed Douglas.

41
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:33,975
I'm sorry about this, John. I know you were best friends.

42
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:41,167
I'll call the Portland Police Captain and tell him you're coming.

43
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,696
- What can I get you? - Sandwich and a glass of ice water.

44
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:10,088
A gift with your next shipment. I will not disappoint you.

45
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:16,406
You will be pleasantly surprised. She is beautiful.

46
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,693
She's blonde.

47
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:23,371
I appreciate your work.

48
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:31,685
I like it when things go like clockwork.

49
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,813
I hate chaos.

50
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:32,291
She was lying down.

51
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:36,251
She screamed as I strangled her.

52
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,927
She lay down and threw her Friday.

53
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:48,927
She was lying there on her back and I was pushing her Friday.

54
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:55,967
I looked down and said, "Do you have a name, darling?"

55
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,411
See ...

56
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:07,855
What do you think?

57
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,089
Let me go!

58
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:36,412
Let's have fun baby.

59
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:39,895
You know you want it.

60
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,212
Do you want to work on me?

61
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,525
It will be great.

62
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,253
Come on, baby.

63
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:33,656
Let me go!

64
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:38,728
Aren't you nice?

65
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,255
Get lost, man.

66
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:54,413
- Or get in line! - Are you talking to me?

67
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:58,371
I'll take your sports car and drive to Acapulco.

68
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:02,015
Go and get him, Spike.

69
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,368
I'll blow you away, you son of a bitch!

70
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:58,535
- John Kim ... - Murder of Sergeant Douglas.

71
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:03,052
I'll take over the Coplands. Captain Kronos.

72
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,606
All of us are currently looking for the killer of a police officer.

73
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:11,012
And the missing persons? Is there anything new about it?

74
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:15,254
That. Cindy Kane.

75
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:32,333
- The same day Douglas was killed. - Yes. Her boyfriend reported her missing.

76
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:36,375
Thank you, Captain.

77
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:47,296
- You're from LA, Hollywood? - I'm trying to find Cindy Kane.

78
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:51,410
- What do you know about her? - She was my girlfriend.

79
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:55,405
But she got mad at me and left with some rich jerk.

80
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:59,496
- Can you describe him? - I don't remember that much that night.

81
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:06,170
I was too drunk. I remember he had a nice car.

82
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:12,168
- Where was the last time you saw them? - Nightclub. Girls go out there.

83
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:16,495
Why is an LA cop interested in all this?

84
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,655
- Can you show me that club? - Of course.

85
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,974
Here, right.

86
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:11,696
She looked at me as if I didn't exist. Then she jumped into the Mercedes.

87
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,695
Hej, Darene, Felix.

88
00:24:57,577 --> 00:25:00,649
Did you see that jerk who took Cindy away?

89
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:06,292
- What are you doing? Stop it! - Let's go.

90
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:25,135
Who is he?

91
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,295
Get out of here.

92
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:35,095
You have a call, Mr.

93
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:50,326
John Kim from LA is here, investigating Douglas' murder.

94
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:54,012
I understand. Thanks.

95
00:25:57,977 --> 00:26:00,127
John Kim?

96
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:03,208
Let's check out this John Kim.

97
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,565
- What's your name? - Stephen.

98
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:10,531
- Not you. You're Cindy's boyfriend. - John Kim.

99
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,446
I could have taken care of that myself, John Kim.

100
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:31,696
- How does she know Cindy Kane? - She's Cindy's dance instructor.

101
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:33,933
Her studio is located at 4 and Alder.

102
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,413
That's great. Great.

103
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:57,092
Feet back.

104
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,290
Good. Use your hips.

105
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:17,456
Great, Tina.

106
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:20,653
Smile, girls. Energy!

107
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:26,649
Irena, take over.

108
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:32,889
All right, keep up, girls. Smile!

109
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:39,729
- How can I help you? - I'm looking for Cindy Kane.

110
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,647
- Why? - She is missing.

111
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:51,817
Now that I think about it, I haven't seen her in a long time. She hasn't been here in a long time.

112
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:57,614
- When was the last time you saw her? - A few weeks ago.

113
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:01,173
Can you tell me something about her?

114
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:04,289
A typical tragic dance story.

115
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:06,965
She was very talented.

116
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:12,456
Then she got lazy, started playing in a nightclub and was looking for a rich man.

117
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:17,006
I know, some people don't have self-esteem.

118
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:23,412
I play because I like it. I don't know why anyone would work for another reason?

119
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:29,726
But again, I'm not Cindy Kane. I like to play.

120
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:34,010
That is almost the most important thing in my life.

121
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:37,413
What is the most important thing in your life?

122
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:40,892
Mommy!

123
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:47,809
- This is the most important thing, me and Erika. - Hi, how are you?

124
00:31:01,057 --> 00:31:05,767
You were great last night, John. Do you dance?

125
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:07,649
Not in public.

126
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:16,256
I'll ask the other girls if they know anything about Cindy.

127
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:35,973
You lost him? I should tell Bolo to cut off your neck.

128
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:41,366
I'll give you another chance. Kill him.

129
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:13,289
Good news! I got the job. I'll start in a week.

130
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:21,892
I don't want to leave LA, but Portland is better for raising a family.

131
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:39,413
I'll see you. Come visit us. We can go fishing. What do you say?

132
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:38,330
Douglas and I always drank tequila. He was a good man.

133
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:54,408
- We got drunk here on several occasions. - He never got drunk in LA.

134
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,293
- Take care. - Okay.

135
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:58,128
- Let's go now. - Quinn, let me handle him.

136
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:53,847
I heard it got nasty there.

137
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:55,775
- Are you OK? - Yes I am.

138
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:59,526
- How about lunch tomorrow? My treat.

139
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,809
- No, I have to do something. - In Big Buster, you'll be there.

140
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:04,769
No, I won't.

141
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:20,366
Do you have a wife?

142
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:23,730
Very subtle.

143
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:28,812
- Your coffee. - Thanks, Jamie.

144
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:42,850
- I just went to your hotel. - Sit down, Steve.

145
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:48,694
I got this today from Cindy. Break up with me.

146
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:51,570
- Through a letter? - Close.

147
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:59,292
Is this Cindy's handwriting?

148
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:05,376
- I don't know, I didn't see it written. - Steve, you? - I haven't seen her either.

149
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:12,897
"I'll be back, but for now I want to get away from everyone."

150
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,930
Strange.

151
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:29,212
How far is Saint Peters?

152
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:32,887
- It's in the southeast? - Yes, about 15 km from here.

153
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:37,490
I have to go.

154
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:45,885
- Thanks for joining us. - Do you have children? - Erika.

155
00:40:57,057 --> 00:41:00,686
- Christy. - Yes. - Looks like I'm free again.

156
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:25,689
Chip, can you take Erica to the studio, please?

157
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,774
My name is Stephen!

158
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,289
Shit!

159
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,328
Go, go!

160
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:25,814
Go faster!

161
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,252
Come on!

162
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:05,370
Come on! Shit!

163
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:11,010
We lose them.

164
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:31,169
Follow him!

165
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,813
Find him.

166
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:53,852
Blake, you go that way. Hollis, you check there.

167
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:56,207
Be careful.

168
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:46,653
- What are you doing here? - I came to warn you.

169
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,729
You're late. Are you OK?

170
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:53,135
- I am angry. - Me too. Because of you!

171
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:58,252
- So arrest me! - Get out of here. - I'm in this too. I'm going with you.

172
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:01,574
- No way! - I need you. I know this terrain.

173
00:47:03,497 --> 00:47:06,091
- Follow me then. - I can't, the car won't start.

174
00:47:06,297 --> 00:47:11,007
- Hell with the car, it'll track you down. - Then think of something.

175
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:20,409
That's great.

176
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:23,892
Now you owe me a car!

177
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:28,175
Did you hear me?

178
00:47:29,857 --> 00:47:34,328
- John, you're hurt. - Nothing serious. It's just blood.

179
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:37,570
I drive.

180
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,576
Shit!

181
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:10,375
I have you now.

182
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:18,292
Did you call in his room?

183
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:28,570
А оnda "A".
Vidiš, "Еrikа". To je savršeno.

184
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:39,046
No, I didn't see her. Try Christie's house.

185
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:43,486
How's it going?

186
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:16,727
Someone obviously doesn't want you to find Cindy Kane.

187
00:51:16,937 --> 00:51:20,930
- There's more to it than that. - Really? What?

188
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:28,490
What? Come on, tell me.

189
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:36,728
I had a partner ...

190
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:43,295
Forget it.

191
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,249
I will.

192
00:51:58,497 --> 00:52:00,965
Well, I'm your partner now.

193
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:07,372
You have to tell me everything.

194
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:13,531
A friend of mine died while working on a missing persons case.

195
00:52:13,737 --> 00:52:18,333
Cindy Kane disappeared the same day Douglas was killed.

196
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:22,371
- Coincidence? - I'll know when I find her.

197
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,568
- Simon Martine. - Sir?

198
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:02,931
- Are you happy with your job here? - Yes sir.

199
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:09,894
So you admit that every mistake here is a consequence of your mistakes? - Sir?

200
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:13,890
- Where are Blake and Hollis? - They're dead, sir.

201
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:17,815
- You saw when they died. - Yes sir.

202
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:25,773
- And your target? - I hit him, sir.

203
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:31,097
So the target is terminated? And?

204
00:53:31,297 --> 00:53:35,927
- I'm sure I hit him. - Is John Kim dead or not?

205
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:37,411
I'm not sure.

206
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:42,247
You left the scene without checking to see if he was dead.

207
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:46,894
Blake and Hollis were loyal employees.

208
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:51,651
Their blood screams for revenge.

209
00:54:07,897 --> 00:54:09,569
Hit it, Bolo.

210
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:16,129
Back!

211
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,893
My career is pretty great.

212
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:56,133
I danced in New York.

213
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,413
In Chicago.

214
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:05,375
I got pregnant with Eric and put everything on hold.

215
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:10,253
I wanted to come back after a year, but ...

216
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:14,446
Her father is gone.

217
00:55:15,297 --> 00:55:18,130
He got the lead role in the dance troupe.

218
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:23,771
So I started to surrender.

219
00:55:25,497 --> 00:55:29,456
It's nice to see how these girls are getting better.

220
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:33,047
But sometimes I find it hard to work on a book

221
00:55:33,257 --> 00:55:39,810
So I go to nightclubs and just relax.

222
00:55:40,777 --> 00:55:43,007
There is nothing wrong with that.

223
00:55:46,737 --> 00:55:50,810
It is sad that her father never saw her.

224
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:54,609
It is a pity.

225
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:01,132
Yes, I think so too.

226
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:16,614
Speaking of Erika ... I have to go.

227
00:56:37,177 --> 00:56:41,216
Erika, let's go home. I know you're tired.

228
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:48,415
- Good night, ladies. - Good night.

229
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:07,535
Hey, tell John Kim I found the man who took Cindy away. - Cindy Kane?

230
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:12,009
I would have beaten him, but he was among friends. Enough of them.

231
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:15,846
- And the rich man was there. - Milversted? - Yes.

232
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:19,816
I'll give him a message if he shows up.

233
00:57:20,017 --> 00:57:23,726
Tell him I work at Hot Flash Pizza House tonight.

234
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:44,207
It's time for a hot meal.

235
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:53,328
Yes, I understand.

236
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:05,330
Bolo, would you like to exercise a little?

237
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:42,970
- Hey, John! Steve was looking for you. - What did he want?

238
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:44,974
I do not know. It sounded important.

239
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:49,216
He said look for him at the Hot Flash Pizza Company.

240
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:13,370
Wait.

241
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,690
John?

242
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:39,171
I'm glad to see you too.

243
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:43,087
Did you find out what Steve wanted?

244
01:00:44,297 --> 01:00:46,447
He was killed.

245
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:06,887
But why would anyone want to kill Steve?

246
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:10,055
You have to take Erica and hide for a few days.

247
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:14,170
- Where are you going? - It's time to fight back.

248
01:01:14,377 --> 01:01:18,052
- Then I'll go with you. - This is not your job. Stay away from this.

249
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:28,175
I know where you're going. And this applies to me as well.

250
01:02:04,337 --> 01:02:08,455
I want a beer! Open up!

251
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:18,328
- Open the door, give me a beer! - Get out of here!

252
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:37,814
Mr. Kim ...

253
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:40,577
What the hell are you doing here?

254
01:03:57,777 --> 01:03:59,529
You bastard!

255
01:05:18,297 --> 01:05:19,889
Thank you, buddy.

256
01:06:56,937 --> 01:06:59,007
He is a valuable opponent.

257
01:07:05,577 --> 01:07:09,172
I will make a donation to your charity. In your name, of course.

258
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:12,527
Usual contribution?

259
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:18,768
It is always a pleasure to do business with you.

260
01:07:30,857 --> 01:07:34,816
- Take care of Eric. - Why? What are you going to do?

261
01:08:35,497 --> 01:08:38,409
Christie? What are you doing here?

262
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:22,135
I have a situation here.

263
01:09:22,337 --> 01:09:25,693
I think Milversted will start now.

264
01:09:25,897 --> 01:09:29,253
Call when you find out where he took the girl.

265
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:32,529
Be ready to help me.

266
01:09:32,737 --> 01:09:36,446
I'll be in the car. The switchboard will connect you with 3-21.

267
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:52,251
This is 6743.

268
01:09:55,537 --> 01:09:56,890
Give me Milversted.

269
01:10:04,497 --> 01:10:09,252
He broke you. He has a girlfriend at the club who is looking for Richard.

270
01:10:09,457 --> 01:10:12,130
Yes, I know, they're here.

271
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:15,056
He wants to play. Don't worry, they're not going anywhere.

272
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:27,770
Take care of him.

273
01:11:28,737 --> 01:11:30,329
Are you up for a dance?

274
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:09,612
I think you'll like my place.

275
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:13,332
Yes, me too. Let's get.

276
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:47,087
- Hey. - We haven't seen each other in a long time.

277
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:09,090
Too bad you've come a long way in this game. We'll take good care of your girlfriend.

278
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:13,654
Bonus to whoever kills him.

279
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:17,808
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

280
01:13:26,497 --> 01:13:28,727
Your queen's turn, take care of him.

281
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,089
Good evening, Christy.

282
01:14:28,977 --> 01:14:31,730
There are people who know where I am!

283
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:34,770
Mr. Kim? He will not join you.

284
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:39,054
Don't bet on that, you son of a bitch!

285
01:14:39,257 --> 01:14:45,014
Let's say he's terribly busy.

286
01:14:50,497 --> 01:14:52,169
Take them away.

287
01:14:58,897 --> 01:15:01,092
Central calls 3-21.

288
01:15:03,937 --> 01:15:08,886
- Wait for the call. - I am waiting.

289
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:15,567
- Captain? - John?

290
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:21,932
- I found the man who kidnapped Cindy. - Where?

291
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:29,933
Throw the gun out the window.

292
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,928
Get out!

293
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,009
Jesus, John ...

294
01:15:45,217 --> 01:15:49,051
Did he pay you or does Milversted give you a commission from selling girls?

295
01:15:49,977 --> 01:15:52,411
What the hell are you talking about?

296
01:15:53,657 --> 01:15:58,048
Every time I went after him, his men showed up to stop me.

297
01:16:05,257 --> 01:16:08,408
They knew when I was looking and where I was going.

298
01:16:08,617 --> 01:16:11,609
I never suspected one of ours until tonight.

299
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:16,254
I never killed - Keep going! I just informed them. Bolo killed them.

300
01:16:16,457 --> 01:16:18,766
Did he kill Douglas too?

301
01:16:18,977 --> 01:16:23,607
Douglas was a good cop, but he didn't want to hear my warnings.

302
01:16:23,817 --> 01:16:27,935
- And Stephen? - You got him involved!

303
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:31,971
How many girls did Milversted send over?

304
01:16:34,017 --> 01:16:35,848
- How much? - Four!

305
01:16:37,537 --> 01:16:42,770
I should break your spine. Where did they take the girls?

306
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:49,328
They took them out of the country. In Asia. In the Middle East.

307
01:16:49,537 --> 01:16:51,414
As a gift. Use your imagination!

308
01:16:51,617 --> 01:16:58,170
- What do you get? Money? - He could have killed me if he wanted to.

309
01:17:02,537 --> 01:17:06,610
Your time is running out, Captain. I'll ask you one more time.

310
01:17:06,817 --> 01:17:08,773
Where did they take Christie?

311
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:16,445
- Pierre 6! - You have a coward's heart.

312
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:18,889
I'll be back for you.

313
01:17:55,457 --> 01:17:58,176
- Say hello to the instructor. - Christy?

314
01:17:59,777 --> 01:18:05,374
- What did you do to her? - Nothing. Heroin took care of her appearance.

315
01:18:05,577 --> 01:18:07,613
Why are you so upset?

316
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:13,767
Thousands of them in this city would sell their mothers for good heroin.

317
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:17,253
It's very expensive, but Cindy knows I'm generous.

318
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:19,925
He does beautiful things for her.

319
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:25,931
Come on, Christy first.

320
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:13,652
Check it out.

321
01:19:58,577 --> 01:20:00,727
You're out of luck today!

322
01:20:14,377 --> 01:20:15,696
Showtime!

323
01:22:46,817 --> 01:22:48,375
John ...

324
01:22:49,897 --> 01:22:51,296
Sindi!

325
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:06,605
Wait here. I'll be right back.

326
01:28:22,657 --> 01:28:26,127
The next day, John returned to Los Angeles.

327
01:28:26,337 --> 01:28:29,727
His partner is dead, as is poor Steve.

328
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:34,010
But again, there was reason to celebrate.

329
01:28:34,217 --> 01:28:39,450
Cindy is free, and Milverstad's dirty organization is destroyed.

330
01:28:39,657 --> 01:28:43,536
This adventure brought us very close.

331
01:28:43,737 --> 01:28:48,857
And John suggests that dance school in LA is not such a bad idea.

332
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:54,131
He himself taught her a few dance steps and joined my school. translation by ear: ranko janković
