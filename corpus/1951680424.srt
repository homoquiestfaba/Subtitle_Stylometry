1
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,420
- Honey, you got the baby?

2
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,530
- Yeah, yeah, I got the...

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,090
I'll get the baby. I thought you had him.

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,850
Oh!

5
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,490
- Daddy's got you.

6
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,430
Daddy's got you.

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,530
Where's my kiss?

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,660
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,580
- Come on. Come on.

10
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,450
You're doing it wrong.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,880
You don't even know what I'm doing.

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,150
I can tell by the cry.

14
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,810
Come on, take Kelly.

15
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,660
Come on, take Kelly. I got this.

16
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,790
Go ahead.

17
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,700
Hey, my big boy... Hi.

18
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,530
- Aw...

19
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,340
That's my big boy.

20
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,640
Oh, yes...

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,380
- Hi, I'm Richard Cooper.

22
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,040
And that's my wife Brenda.

23
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,780
We have two incredible children, Brian and Kelly.

24
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,350
We've been married close to seven years.

25
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,190
My wife is beautiful, intelligent

26
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,350
and a great mother.

27
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,160
It's the perfect life.

28
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,670
There's just one problem:

29
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,100
- I'm bored out of my fucking mind.

30
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,610
Now, I'm sure I'd have a much rosier outlook on life

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,800
if my wife and I actually had sex,

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,000
but there always seems to be something wrong.

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,670
No, my face hurts.

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,220
It's not your birthday.

35
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,090
We both work, we're both tired, but that's no excuse.

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,220
To be honest, I don't know

37
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,090
how much more of this I can take.

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Richard, do you think perhaps you work too much?

39
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,970
Oh, no, no, no.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
L-I work, too. I do.

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,660
But I come home from work, and I have to take care of the kids,

42
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,040
and I have to take care of you.

43
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,330
And frankly, I'm tired.

44
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,430
I'm tired.

45
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,440
Too tired to wear a nice pair of panties?

46
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,670
What's wrong with my panties?

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,870
They're huge!

48
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,740
You know, the biggest thing on a pair of panties

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,980
should be the tag.

50
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,780
- Tag and ass.

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,820
Tag and ass!

52
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,580
- You see? You see?

53
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,120
- This is what I'm talking about. - Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,590
You see how insensitive he is?

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,180
You know, Brenda, maybe I'd be more sensitive

56
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,490
if you'd have sex with me.

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,930
It seems like the only time

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
she wants to have sex with me is to make a baby.

59
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,800
The only time you want to make a baby with me

60
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,260
is to have sex.

61
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,800
That doesn't make any sense!

62
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,170
Well, that's because I'm tired!

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,700
Now we're making progress.

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,560
- I hated that therapist.

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,370
She wasn't married and didn't have any kids.

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,780
You know,

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,640
when you're on a plane, you kind of want a pilot

68
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
with more experience than you.

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,610
But maybe that's just me.

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,210
Now, what I can't figure out is how can my wife

71
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,230
not have sex with me, and then send me out

72
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,490
into a world with so many beautiful women?

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,220
That's like dropping me into the ocean

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,790
and expecting me to not get wet.

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,390
I mean, every single woman that I see

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,870
I have an imaginary relationship with.

77
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,960
Like this one.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
Ah, she's got beautiful lips.

79
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,980
But if we got married, how long would it be

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,510
before I got tired of those lips?

81
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,780
How long would it be

82
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,510
before those lips called me an asshole?

83
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,490
And look at her.

84
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,990
What a smile.

85
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,610
She looks happy now,

86
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,680
but if I was married to her for eight years,

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,460
I'djust be thinking about that phone bill.

88
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,590
I don't know.

89
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,030
And look at her.

90
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,660
Look at those eyes, those cheekbones.

91
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,930
She's like a painting... a painting I'd love to mount.

92
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,480
No matter where my head is,

93
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,110
when I get to Manhattan, I'm fine.

94
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,950
I love the city, rats and all.

95
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,850
I love myjob.

96
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,450
I'm an investment banker at a mid-size firm.

97
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,590
I'm one of the only blacks at the company.

98
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,430
As a matter of fact, there are so few blacks here,

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,090
I think I know every black person that works for the firm.

100
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,570
Morning, Pam.

101
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,630
Howdy, Mr. Cooper.

102
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,940
Morning, Ron.

103
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,310
Good morning, Richard.

104
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,420
#Yo, fuck the cracker #

105
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,890
#That's what I say #

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,830
#And fuck these bitches that always want to play #

107
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,520
# I'm the type of nigga that is never gay #

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
# If you fuck with me, I'll put your head in cake #

109
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,400
# If you fuck with me, I'll shoot your moms at your wake #

110
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,960
# If you fuck with me, you made a big mistake. #

111
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,640
Okay.

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,370
Tracy...

113
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,270
this is what we're doing today, all right?

114
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,470
Seen George?

115
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,070
I'm right here.

116
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,370
See you later, Mary.

117
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,110
George, your wife is on the phone, and Veronica called.

118
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,740
Wife? I don't want to talk to her.

119
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,380
Find out what she wants.

120
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,890
Call back Veronica.

121
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,550
Rich, you want to go over that stuff

122
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,610
before Landis gets in?

123
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,820
Sure, just, uh, take off your coat...

124
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,290
Good morning, everyone.

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,450
Cooper, how's the Coleman account?

126
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,120
Incredible. The Narco funds are up.

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,320
- All right.

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,300
Let's get to work, people.

129
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,570
- Pupkin & Langford. Please hold.

130
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,630
Pupkin & Langford.

131
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,870
Lunch?

132
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,700
Well, I got to ask.

133
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,210
Come on, you know I hate the crowds.

134
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,870
By the time you get your food, you got to come back.

135
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,150
Well, have fun all by yourself.

136
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,810
I'm gonna get a quick bite and then get on the Coleman account.

137
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,520
See ya.

138
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,120
- Hey, I got nothing against George,

139
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,850
but I just hate going to lunch

140
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,290
at the same time everybody else does.

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
It's just way too crowded.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,660
Look at this mess.

143
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,170
It's just not the New York that I like.

144
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,740
Now, at 2:00, it's a different story.

145
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,740
Things slow down.

146
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,510
That's when I like to go out.

147
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,950
I can eat, or I can go shopping,

148
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,920
or I can just clear my head.

149
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,220
And I can also watch women and get a good look.

150
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,980
'Cause I know I will never see them again.

151
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,550
Now, you can't look at a woman in the suburbs.

152
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,650
You stare at a soccer mom too long,

153
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,220
and they'll post your name on the Internet.

154
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,040
Can I help you find something?

155
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,200
Just looking.

156
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,850
Have you seen the new Prada suits?

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,050
No, that's okay, that's okay.

158
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,650
Excuse me, sir, would you like to try a new fragrance today?

159
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,660
Nah, that's okay.

160
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,750
- Oh.

161
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,760
Hey! Don't spray that shit on me.

162
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,530
It's really good.

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,930
Hi, I'm Candy.

164
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,840
Can I help you with something?

165
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,500
Do you have this in blue?

166
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,510
You know, I think you should try this green one.

167
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,840
Uh, l-I don't really wear green.

168
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,440
Okay, but this green is hot.

169
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,450
Come on. Trust me.

170
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,580
Let's go try it on.

171
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,680
I'm telling you, I don't like green.

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,790
That looks great on you.

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,800
You think so?

174
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,660
Absolutely. It's sexy.

175
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,660
I love it.

176
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,790
I just don't like wearing green.

177
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,430
Yeah, but you should start wearing green.

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,770
I mean, you look really handsome in it.

179
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,500
Hey, Lisa.

180
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,200
Will you tell him how this shirt looks.

181
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,040
Oh, I love it on you!

182
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm-I'm not just saying that.

183
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,270
I think it looks great on you.

184
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,910
Daddy's home.

185
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,420
- Daddy's home.

186
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,780
- Daddy!

187
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,190
Yeah!

188
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,550
Daddy's home.

189
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,530
Hey, Daddy.

190
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,560
How's it going?

191
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,560
Pretty good.

192
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,560
Where's Brian?

193
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,100
Oh, he's upstairs napping.

194
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,930
Oh, hey, I've got all these tests to grade,

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,330
so can you do the dishes tonight?

196
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,460
- Yeah, yeah, no problem. - Great.

197
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,660
Hey, Kelly.

198
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,230
Hi, Daddy.

199
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,860
How big is Kelly?

200
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,030
This big.

201
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,370
- Yeah. Where's Kelly's ear?

202
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,410
Here.

203
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,710
- Where's Kelly's nose? - Here.

204
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,580
Where's Kelly's esophagus?

205
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
Give the kid a break; she's only three.

206
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,180
Hey, there's white kids that are three

207
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,450
taking the bar right now.

208
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,750
W-H-l-T-E, please.

209
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,050
Okay, okay.

210
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,360
Hey, Kelly, I got you.

211
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,560
- Daddy got you.

212
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,660
- Right upside the head. - You went shopping? Huh.

213
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,560
Daddy got you.

214
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,100
I thought you didn't like green.

215
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,170
It's different.

216
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,710
Pretty.

217
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,000
- There were days when Brenda and I got along great.

218
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,670
But we still weren't having sex.

219
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,310
When a married couple stops having sex,

220
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,850
at first, they complain about it.

221
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,120
But after a while, they get used to it.

222
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,560
She walks out of the shower, you don't even look.

223
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,390
'Cause you know there's nothing there for you.

224
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,860
The most dangerous time

225
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,920
in a marriage is when the couple accepts

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,490
that they're not having sex.

227
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,230
Speak up; I'm in an elevator.

228
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,330
- Richard, there's someone here to see you.

229
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,270
Uh, a client?

230
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,430
She didn't say.

231
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,480
Nikki?

232
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,450
- Wow, Nikki Tru.

233
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,680
I haven't seen her in eight years.

234
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,150
She was my best friend's girl.

235
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,750
I was crazy about her.

236
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,920
What's wrong?

237
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,390
You didn't think you'd see me again?

238
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,560
No, it's not that; I'm just surprised.

239
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,930
Wow, you look good, Nikki.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,930
Thanks.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,490
You know, people don't really smoke in offices anymore.

242
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,830
I'm not really a smoker.

243
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,270
I'm just trying to lose some weight.

244
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,000
So what's that, a diet cigarette?

245
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,410
I'll put it out.

246
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,910
You look good, Richie.

247
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,610
That's a nice shirt.

248
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,080
Thanks.

249
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,980
So, wh-what brings you around, Nikki?

250
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,850
I was in the neighborhood, heard you worked in the area,

251
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,890
thought I'd stop by and say hi.

252
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,260
That's allowed, right?

253
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,590
Yeah. Hi.

254
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,130
Hi.

255
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,000
You want to show me your office or something?

256
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,000
Come on.

257
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,300
Okay.

258
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,430
It's good to see you.

259
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,530
Yeah, you, too.

260
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,540
- Which way? - This way.

261
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,770
- Are these your kids?

262
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,570
Yeah, that's my son Brian

263
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,540
and that's my daughter Kelly.

264
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,410
Same mother?

265
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,240
Same mother, my wife, seven years.

266
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,810
No side kids?

267
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,820
No side kids.

268
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,250
I know, it's very white of me.

269
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,820
Richard Marcus Cooper is married.

270
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,360
Tied the knot, till death do you part.

271
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,490
Mm-hmm.

272
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,790
Something strange about that?

273
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,830
No. Just...

274
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,490
not the Richie I knew.

275
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,970
- People change. - Hmm.

276
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,060
You happily married?

277
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,630
Yeah, I'm-I'm happily married.

278
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,070
No, you're not.

279
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,240
You didn't say it right.

280
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,640
Okay, how was I supposed to say it?

281
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,050
Oh, I don't know.

282
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,880
But you're not supposed to think about it.

283
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,850
I hear ice cracking.

284
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
What?

285
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,710
You ever walk across a frozen river

286
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,760
and hear ice cracking?

287
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
It's the scariest sound in the world.

288
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,860
Hey, hey.

289
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,190
My ice is fine.

290
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,700
My-my marriage is frozen solid.

291
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
You could do a triple axel on my marriage.

292
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,820
One second.

293
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,200
Hello.

294
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,360
- They're ready to start the meeting.

295
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,170
Yeah, yeah, I'll come right now.

296
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,570
So, to be completely honest,

297
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,410
I do need a favor.

298
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
Ah. I knew Nikki didn't come over here for nothing.

299
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,980
Well, I just got back in town, and I'm trying to get a job,

300
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,750
but I need a reference.

301
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,050
Okay, well, write up a letter,

302
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,610
bring it by, and I'll sign it.

303
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,950
No problem. Whoa!

304
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,890
Magic.

305
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,160
So you just knew I would sign this, huh?

306
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,060
Lfigured a friend in need, couldn't resist.

307
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,120
Okay.

308
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,040
Good luck.

309
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,600
Thank you...

310
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,700
Mr. Married Man.

311
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,840
- Even though I hadn't seen Nikki

312
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,640
- in eight years, I got to say, - Richard.

313
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,050
She looked even better than I remembered.

314
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,270
Gonna put these right on top of the block.

315
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,110
- Do I have to eat this, Mommy?

316
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,120
- - Kelly... - Hey.

317
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,180
- Hey, Daddy. - Hey, honey.

318
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,350
Mm.

319
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,550
I'm almost done with them,

320
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,320
and dinner will be ready in a few minutes, okay?

321
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,330
Is baked chicken okay?

322
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,330
Ah, you know chicken's great.

323
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,460
All right.

324
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,120
Where's my kiss?

325
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,130
Ooh, that's a good kiss.

326
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,900
What's up, Bri?

327
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,870
So how was school?

329
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,370
You know that test I was giving?

330
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,600
I had to give it again.

331
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,940
They all got A's.

332
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,710
Oh, um, Allison wants to have a playdate

333
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,840
this weekend at her house.

334
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,040
Any B-L-A-C-K kids gonna be there?

335
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,140
A few. Not enough.

336
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,310
You know, I'm thinking of joining a Mocha Moms group

337
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,650
in New Rochelle.

338
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,690
That'll be good.

339
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,090
I got to do something.

340
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,650
Hey, how was, um, work today?

341
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,890
Anything happen?

342
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,660
Ah, nothing much, just work.

343
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,890
- I'm not crazy.

344
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,800
Would you tell your wife about Nikki?

345
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,740
But I got to admit, seeing Nikki got me to thinking.

346
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,330
What would it be like to be single again?

347
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,310
I mean, if I were single,

348
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,900
I wouldn't do all that romance-and-flowers crap.

349
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,780
If I were single again, I would get right to the point.

350
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,780
Excuse me, would you like to have sex with me?

351
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,790
- Of course I would. - Well, come on!

352
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,480
When you're single, you're never at a loss for words.

353
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,680
Excuse me, can I bite your ass?

354
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,850
For $1,000.

355
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,120
Come on, let's get biting, bitch!

356
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,890
When you're single, you have nothing to lose.

357
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,520
Come with me to a hotel right now.

358
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
But I have an appointment.

359
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,700
Yeah, a pussy appointment.

360
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,430
When you're single, you're invincible.

361
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,440
Excuse me...

362
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,100
Get the fuck out of here!

363
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,140
When you're single, you're alone.

364
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,800
I'll fuck you.

365
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,180
And that's why I got married.

366
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,290
When I went to work the next day,

367
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,120
being single was the last thing on my mind.

368
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,820
I had a lot to do,

369
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,020
there was a big client I wanted to bring in,

370
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,330
and I needed to be focused.

371
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,760
You know what I always say,

372
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,570
valuation's an art not a science.

373
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,760
Hey, want to go to lunch?

374
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,770
I got a plan how we can reel in EuroTech.

375
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm gonna pass on the lunch,

376
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,700
but let's talk about it when you get back.

377
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,870
Have fun with yourself.

378
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,170
Walter, listen,

379
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,810
I know you're in bed with Cross and Lubitsch,

380
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,870
but I'm telling you right now,

381
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,250
you're gonna see some things in the...

382
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,050
There's a Nikki Tru on line one.

383
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,280
: Tell her to hold.

384
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,120
Well, I just want you to know

385
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,950
that our doors are always open.

386
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,720
All right, take care, Walter.

387
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,590
Nikki.

388
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,130
Hey.

389
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
I got the job.

390
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,370
Good.

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,730
So as a thank you,

392
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,970
I was thinking you should let me take you to lunch.

393
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,200
You know, I don't normally do lunch till late.

394
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,970
Well, that's okay, 'cause I'm still in bed,

395
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,570
but I could get in the shower and be to you in about an hour.

396
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,640
You know, I got

397
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,240
a lot of work to do, Nikki.

398
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,850
But you are gonna eat lunch, right?

399
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,750
So I'll be there at 2:00.

400
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,880
Okay?

401
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,950
Okay.

402
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,960
Good.

403
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,460
Bye.

404
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,930
- Excuse me, miss, there's no smoking.

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,930
Okay, I'm putting it out.

406
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,900
I live on the West Side with Teddy.

407
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,570
He has a place here and in D.C.,

408
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,580
although most of my stuff is in D.C.

409
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,980
So how'd you meet Teddy from D.C.?

410
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,010
He's a club promoter.

411
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,070
I met him out.

412
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,080
You know how it goes.

413
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,120
Yeah.

414
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,850
So do I know your wife?

415
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,820
I don't think so.

416
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,590
Is she white?

417
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,490
No.

418
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,120
Why-why would you ask that?

419
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Don't get offended.

420
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,430
Remember that girl you brought to Andre's party?

421
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,590
- It was one girl at one party.

422
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,140
L-I go out with one white girl,

423
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,470
all of a sudden, I'm Prince?

424
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,270
No, it was just a question.

425
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,330
I didn't mean anything by it.

426
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,110
So do you and your black wife still fuck?

427
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,210
And what's it to you?

428
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,840
Mmm, just curious.

429
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,910
Most of the people I know who are still married

430
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,110
say that after a while, they don't fuck.

431
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,710
So do you love Teddy?

432
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,230
You didn't answer my question.

433
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,460
'Cause it's none of your fucking business.

434
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,550
I'll take that as a no.

435
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,840
So, Mr. Married Man,

436
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,060
how did you meet this black wife of yours?

437
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,370
You don't want to know.

438
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,870
No, I do.

439
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,970
Sort of.

440
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,200
I was...

441
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,540
coming from a meeting, I was walking by the park,

442
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,810
and she was there with her class,

443
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,940
this beautiful woman with these kids.

444
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,780
I don't know- there was just something

445
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,550
really calm about her.

446
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,820
And I was like, "I got to meet her."

447
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,950
- Wow.

448
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,590
: I guess I was wrong.

449
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,720
You do love your wife.

450
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,030
I've thought about it.

451
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,970
Doing the whole wife thing, having kids.

452
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm getting a little old for the club scene.

453
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,080
I don't even know how you do it.

454
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,670
Hanging out late,

455
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,840
- eating cheeseburgers at 4:00 in the morning. - God...

456
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,570
Come on.

457
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,550
You used to love this shit.

458
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,380
You just let yourself get old.

459
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,940
I just let myself get bored.

460
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,250
This was fun.

461
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,060
We should do this again.

462
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,720
Yeah. Maybe.

463
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,390
Okay.

464
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,310
- Saturday is the one day

465
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,210
I like to sit in my house and relax.

466
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,810
Unfortunately, it's also the same day

467
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,940
that Brenda likes to go into Manhattan and shop.

468
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,150
Brenda didn't like living in the city,

469
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,820
but she sure liked buying her clothes there.

470
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,150
Honey, why don't you get these?

471
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,160
I like them.

472
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,260
Oh, yeah.

473
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,730
Okay, well, let's find your size

474
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,990
so that you can wear them.

475
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,470
Ah, come on, we drove all the way to the city.

476
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,330
You could've got those at the Panty Depot.

477
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,100
Oh, come on. No, I like these.

478
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,840
- And they're comfortable, and they're cute. - Richard?

479
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,570
Richard.

480
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,270
I thought you lived in Westchester.

481
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,180
- What are you doing here? - Hey.

482
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,740
Nikki, Brenda.

483
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,150
Brenda, Nikki.

484
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,690
- Hi. - Hi.

485
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,550
Nikki's an old friend.

486
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,920
Uh, what's it been, like, seven, eight years?

487
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,290
At least.

488
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,420
Uh, Nikki used to date Nelson, remember?

489
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,430
Yes. Yes!

490
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,660
: Right.

491
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,720
And who is this handsome guy?

492
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,790
Oh, well, that's my Brian.

493
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,800
And that's Kelly.

494
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,900
- Hi.

495
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,940
She's gorgeous.

496
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,000
Of course, like her mom.

497
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,060
Thank you.

498
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,040
Say, "thank you," Kelly.

499
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,670
- Thank you.

500
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,300
These are great.

501
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,400
Where did you get these?

502
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,640
Is this the Heavenly Collection?

503
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,980
No, they're from the Latifah Collection.

504
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,250
: Okay.

505
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,580
Stop.

506
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,420
Um, actually, I don't know what they are.

507
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,480
But I got them downstairs.

508
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,720
Well, I should go pay for these.

509
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,950
Um, it was really nice to meet you.

510
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,220
Yes.

511
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,890
And it was great seeing you, Richard.

512
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,300
Oh, great to see you.

513
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,430
Guys.

514
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,200
- Bye-bye.

515
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,270
So she's the one that, uh,

516
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,440
Nelson tried to kill himself over?

517
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,840
Yeah, he-he was going through a lot back then.

518
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,640
Huh.

519
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,580
Yeah, guess he was.

520
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,660
I'm gonna take these back.

521
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,520
- Okay, that was a lie.

522
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,290
But big deal.

523
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,760
I mean, nothing happened.

524
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,730
Nikki's a friend.

525
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,170
An old friend.

526
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,730
I mean, I've known Nikki longer than I've known Brenda.

527
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,670
She used to date Nelson.

528
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,140
We had a lot of fun together.

529
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,800
I mean, sh-she makes me laugh.

530
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,510
Th-There's nothing wrong with that, right?

531
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,740
Nikki's an old friend, a good friend.

532
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,720
A friend I can't tell my wife about.

533
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,720
Morning, Richard.

534
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,620
- Nikki called. - Five minutes ago.

535
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,590
She said she'll be by at 6:00.

536
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,630
Is there something wrong?

537
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,630
No.

538
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,760
- Nothing. - Nothing at all.

539
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,120
Wall sconces?

540
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,640
Well, they're not expensive

541
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
and we can get an electrician to put them in.

542
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,570
What do you think of art deco?

543
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,230
Art deco's fine.

544
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,740
- Hey.

545
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,970
Okay, if we go with art deco,

546
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,270
we might have to reupholster the couch.

547
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,180
I thought we were talking about wall sconces.

548
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,550
Well, they have to match, honey.

549
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,450
If they don't match, then I got to change the rug.

550
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,080
- If I have to change the rug... - I guess you're right.

551
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,780
Uh, honey, could we talk about this later?

552
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,150
Yes. Look, I have to go- it's parent-teacher night.

553
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,320
Lfixed you a plate, so just heat it up when you get home.

554
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,160
Okay. So I'll-I'll talk to you later.

555
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,230
Wall sconces.

556
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
Sounds fun.

557
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,500
When exactly do you start

558
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,470
getting calls at work about wall sconces?

559
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,800
Right after you get married.

560
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,840
I mean, before you get married, you get calls like...

561
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,740
I can't wait to suck your dick.

562
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,940
Then, after you get married, you get calls like...

563
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,140
I can't wait for you to come home

564
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,350
and see these drapes.

565
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,320
Poor Mr. Married Man.

566
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,380
I hope you don't mind me stopping by like this,

567
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,160
but I bought something for your kids.

568
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,200
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you guys.

569
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,860
Hey, you didn't have to get me anything.

570
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,860
I know.

571
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,800
Thanks.

572
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,800
This stuff's expensive.

573
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,240
Oh, don't worry about it.

574
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,640
I put it on Teddy's credit card.

575
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,800
So now I owe Teddy some money.

576
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,880
So you're the expert- what do you think?

577
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,810
Would I make a good wife?

578
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,480
Nikki, you don't want to be a wife.

579
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,490
Why?

580
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,540
You want a wedding.

581
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,990
You want the show.

582
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,960
Mm-hmm.

583
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,650
What are you looking at?

584
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,720
You have any singles?

585
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,160
Yeah, I should have about seven, eight bucks.

586
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,160
What do you need?

587
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,820
Just give me all of it.

588
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,340
All right, I'm gonna have to break into my stripper stash.

589
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,470
What are you doing?

590
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,440
Feeding the fish.

591
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,640
Come here.

592
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,200
Look.

593
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,080
Okay, who is gonna get it?

594
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,140
Oh, look at this guy.

595
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

596
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,260
Whoo...!

597
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,420
Shh!

598
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,860
It's just a dollar.

599
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,160
It's just a dollar.

600
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,320
It's just a buck.

601
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,060
- This is decadent. - Try it.

602
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,390
All right. All right, here we go.

603
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,870
Whoo!

604
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,920
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

605
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,990
Yeah!

606
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,700
You're going to cause a riot.

607
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,000
Well done!

608
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,430
Yes!

609
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,910
Oh, wow!

610
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,140
Ooh, look at the homeless guy.

611
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,880
Oh, get the mon... Oh, he needs it.

612
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,110
Never gonna get it.

613
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,170
Nope. Going too slow.

614
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,650
Come on, homeless guy. You need that money.

615
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,720
Get it.

616
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,350
- Nope. - Oh!

617
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,420
White man wins again.

618
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,740
- That was fun.

619
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,210
That was too much fun.

620
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,540
You know what?

621
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,810
I better take my wife out to dinner

622
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,910
and get the stench of fun with another woman off of me.

623
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,490
- I don't even want to go that way, ; you can't go down the FDR.

624
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,820
- - Oh, God, no. - It's insane.

625
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,880
- Okay, this is safe.

626
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,760
Dinner with Allan and Jennifer.

627
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,990
Once you get married,

628
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,760
you only hang out with other married people.

629
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,130
Why?

630
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,430
'Cause no single person could stand to be around you.

631
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,470
It wasn't always like this.

632
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,310
We all used to talk about sex, politics, art.

633
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,540
But now, all we ever talk about is our kids.

634
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,170
Of course, I had to miss the end,

635
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,550
because I had a little exploding diaper problem.

636
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,170
And when it's not our kids,

637
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,220
it's always the same conversation.

638
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,910
First, there's the rap conversation.

639
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,980
...hos, hos, hos in different area codes.

640
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,750
I'm kind of wondering, did anybody have a nice mama?

641
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,090
Was it a situation where their mama

642
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,090
smacked them upside their head,

643
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,460
and they said, "Bitch!"

644
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,160
Then there's the conversation about theJews.

645
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,760
They had it just as bad as us.

646
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,930
Black folks need to take care of themselves

647
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,490
just as well as theJews take care of themselves.

648
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,130
Except we can't stick together- that's the problem.

649
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,300
We're too busy buying spinning rims and gold teeth.

650
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,370
You think Steven Spielberg got spinning rims?

651
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,110
And no group of people are too sophisticated to have

652
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,650
a conversation about Michael Jackson.

653
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,870
I blameJoe.

654
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,470
- Please, what grown-ass man

655
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,210
sleeps in a bed with kids?

656
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,380
MichaelJackson just didn't have a childhood.

657
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,050
Hey, man, childhood's only 12, 15 years.

658
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,450
Michael's, like, 50.

659
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,460
How many sliding boards does this nigga need?

660
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,660
You know good and well you would not let that man babysit your kids.

661
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,720
I wouldn't let MichaelJackson watch my kids on TV.

662
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,460
- Amen.

663
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,160
Maybe he thought the little boy was 18.

664
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,670
- You can't confuse the little boy.

665
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,140
Give me a break.

666
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,260
- Just yesterday, little Sharon

667
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,640
came into the room singing "Magic Stick."

668
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,540
I said, "Magic Stick"? Little girl, you're four years old.

669
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,240
What do you know about a magic stick?"

670
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,140
Can I take your drink orders?

671
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,510
- Honey?

672
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,240
Uh, you know what? I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

673
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,580
Honey, can you just get me some water?

674
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,810
- Think I'll take a ginger ale.

675
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,820
- I'll have a Chardonnay.

676
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,450
Okay.

677
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,580
Excuse me, can I talk to you for a second?

678
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,220
Is there a problem, sir?

679
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,730
Yes, there's a problem.

680
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,130
See, I came here for a lovely dinner

681
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,560
with my wife and some friends,

682
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,460
and next thing I know is I got these big tits

683
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,190
asking me if I want a drink.

684
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,460
Do you mean your waitperson?

685
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,730
Listen, man, I'm with my wife.

686
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,270
I don't need this shit.

687
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,740
I don't need some girl, with her big-ass village feeders,

688
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,540
asking me if I need some help.

689
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,810
Is this Hooters?

690
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,810
No, sir.

691
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,210
- Is it Hooters? - No, sir.

692
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,810
I know this ain't Hooters, 'cause-'cause if it is,

693
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,150
you owe me some fucking buffalo wings.

694
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,120
: Sir, what can I do to make this better?

695
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,030
See that guy right there?

696
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,650
Yes, I do.

697
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,360
That's my waiter.

698
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,730
Thank you, sir.

699
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,630
Thank you.

700
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,220
What are you doing here?

701
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,780
You okay?

702
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,330
So he just got up and said, "It's over"?

703
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,730
No, you don't understand.

704
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,670
If we're fucking and I fall asleep, that's fine.

705
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,290
If we're fucking and we both fall asleep,

706
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,000
that's okay, too, but if we're fucking

707
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,870
and you fall asleep, it's-it's fucked up!

708
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,740
He didn't say it's over, but I know it's over.

709
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,540
You-you got to excuse her; she's upset.

710
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,600
The fuck are you looking at?!

711
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,580
Our stop's coming up.

712
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,920
- When Nikki came by to see me in the afternoon,

713
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,830
it wasn't really a big deal.

714
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,330
But when we walked through the office at 9:00 a. M...

715
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,530
Good morning.

716
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,970
...people looked at me like I was crazy.

717
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,270
I mean crazy.

718
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,970
It's like we've been breaking up for months,

719
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
and I'm just finding out about it now.

720
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,170
Well, that's how relationships are.

721
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,150
You add how long you been together,

722
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,680
and then you divide it by two,

723
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,380
and that's how long you been breaking up.

724
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,980
So if you get a divorce after 20 years,

725
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,790
you been breaking up for ten.

726
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,850
That's right.

727
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,360
So can I stay with you for a couple days?

728
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,560
Nikki, my wife...

729
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,200
Oh...

730
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,370
I'm just playing with you.

731
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,550
You should see the look on your face right now.

732
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,040
Okay, I'm not trying to get rid of you, Nikki, but I really...

733
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,250
iPod.

734
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,550
You got some nigga ears.

735
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,180
Nigga what?

736
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,060
Some old-ass nigga ears.

737
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,760
Look at this, Levert, Patti LaBelle, Luther Vandross.

738
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,460
You know, white people make music, too.

739
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,470
I got George Michael.

740
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,560
Doesn't count.

741
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,660
Okay, I'm gonna give you my iPod,

742
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,730
and you are gonna give me yours.

743
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,780
Okay.

744
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,000
When you get a chance,

745
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,040
I want you to listen to that song.

746
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,080
Can I get back to work now?

747
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,710
# Fuck the cracker, that's what I say #

748
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,980
#And fuck these bitches that always want to play #

749
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,310
# I'm the type of nigga that's never gay #

750
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,820
# If you fuck with me, I'll put your head in cake... #

751
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,470
I think he might be off the phone.

752
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,380
That girl is here to see you.

753
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,720
Well, just send her in.

754
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,780
Richard...

755
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,350
...can I ask you something?

756
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,490
Hi.

757
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,000
It can wait.

758
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,330
I don't think your secretaries like me.

759
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,770
Hey, they don't like me, either.

760
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,830
You know, if you keep showing up like this,

761
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,430
we're gonna have to get you a job here.

762
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,670
People are gonna start talking.

763
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,710
Oh, let them talk.

764
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,370
I need you to do me a favor.

765
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,640
Can you come uptown with me to look at a place?

766
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,650
You know, l-I got a lot of work to do.

767
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,020
I got to get out ofTeddy's,

768
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,460
and... he's supposed to be out of town.

769
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,820
I'd like to be out by the time he gets back.

770
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,820
Are you okay?

771
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,090
Can you come with me?

772
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,660
Yeah, yeah.

773
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,360
- Let me just check. - Okay.

774
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,000
Tracy, what's my rest of the day look like?

775
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,200
You and George have a conference call at 3:00.

776
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,500
Damn. George!

777
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,540
Yeah?

778
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,410
You need me for that call at 3:00?

779
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,240
I do. Why?

780
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,540
I got to do something.

781
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,780
I mean, l-I should be back, but if I'm not,

782
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,010
you can handle it, right?

783
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,250
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.

784
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
Hi, I'm George.

785
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,260
- Nikki. - Nice to meet you.

786
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,020
Likewise.

787
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,690
So, I'll see you later?

788
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,590
You tell me.

789
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,030
- You sure this is what you want?

790
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,270
- It's what I can afford.

791
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,170
So, where do you work?

792
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,150
I'm a hostess at a place downtown called The White Bar.

793
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,620
Oh, that's nice.

794
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,080
 Well, here you go.

795
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,180
Washer and dryer on the third floor,

796
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,550
pay phone on the second floor.

797
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,320
Don't knock on my door for change.

798
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,990
Get your own damn quarters.

799
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,660
Um, there was something in the ad about cable.

800
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,890
I got jumper cables, if you need 'em.

801
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,990
Okay.

802
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,470
And don't blame me if the bed's

803
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,970
not big enough for both of you.

804
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,500
This place is really for students.

805
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,060
 Oh, we are not a couple.

806
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,570
Yeah, yeah, l-I'm just a friend.

807
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,730
Oh.

808
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,180
I guess that's a Super Bowl ring, huh?

809
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,770
You a Jet or a Packer?

810
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,610
Uh-huh.

811
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,480
Which one of you friends is paying the rent?

812
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,920
I am.

813
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,280
Sure you are, baby.

814
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,750
I never thought I'd be back in one of these.

815
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,120
This is where everybody ends up.

816
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,960
- A wooden Barton hutch made of pine in Al's backyard.

817
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,590
This is a project an experienced do-it-yourselfer could tackle,

818
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,130
since this shed is pre-cut and ready to assemble.

819
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,110
- - Hi!

820
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,910
- How are you guys? - Very well, thanks.

821
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,950
That doesn't look so hard; we can do that out back.

822
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,810
I'm getting splinters just watching this.

823
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,260
I got to hand it to you- you knocked it out the park.

824
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,820
It looks like EuroTech may come aboard.

825
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,290
Hey, it's not a done deal, and when it gets done,

826
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,130
I couldn't have done it without you.

827
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,460
What do you say we go grab some lunch and celebrate?

828
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,400
L-I'd love to... but I got other plans.

829
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,270
- Hey, guys. You ready?

830
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,570
Can I talk to you for a second?

831
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,870
Yeah, sure.

832
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,310
- Inside.

833
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,640
- Be right back. - Okay.

834
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,240
I'm sorry. I won't keep him long.

835
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,010
No problem.

836
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,660
Okay, what is it?

837
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,560
Are you aware of what you're getting yourself into?

838
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,610
What are you talking about?

839
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,630
Nikki- she's here every day.

840
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,820
George, she's just a friend.

841
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,360
A friend? Come on.

842
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,270
I've had friends before- they don't fucking look like Nikki.

843
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,070
Look, you got a good situation at home, you got two kids...

844
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,830
I'm not fucking her.

845
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,770
No, she's fucking you; you just don't know it.

846
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,540
: I can't believe I'm hearing this shit from you,

847
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,080
of all people.

848
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,380
You cheat on your wife all the time.

849
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,540
Last year, you were fucking Tracy and Mary.

850
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,880
I didn't say shit to you.

851
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,480
That's different.

852
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,920
I don't give a fuck.

853
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,620
I can fuck a girl, go home,

854
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,020
kiss my wife good night and sleep like a baby.

855
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,790
You, on the other hand, got emotions.

856
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,830
You're like Captain Save-A-Ho, all right?

857
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,460
You like to be needed, and that bitch knows it.

858
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,430
Are we done?

859
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,730
I'm not getting in your shit, all right?

860
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,040
I just...

861
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,080
Be careful, okay?

862
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,380
Hey.

863
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,610
What's wrong?

864
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,350
You look upset.

865
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,390
We can't do this anymore.

866
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,720
Do what? What are you talking about?

867
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,760
This whole... lunch in the afternoon thing.

868
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,020
It doesn't look good; we really should stop.

869
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,190
We're not doing anything.

870
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,320
It's not like we're fucking.

871
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,630
It is like we're fucking,

872
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,500
only thing, we're not fucking,

873
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,800
and I feel all the guilt as if I'm fucking you

874
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,240
without any of the pleasure of actually fucking you.

875
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,330
I don't want things to get any more complicated.

876
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,880
I'm not trying to complicate anything.

877
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,240
I like you, Richard.

878
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,010
I don't like a lot of people.

879
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,980
I like you 'cause you're safe.

880
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,320
You don't want anything from me.

881
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,410
Okay?

882
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,320
Okay.

883
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,350
So, you want to get something to eat?

884
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,730
No.

885
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,960
I have something else planned.

886
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,620
Wow.

887
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,820
I've been thinking about coming here.

888
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,960
I knew you'd like it.

889
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,370
You should have one of these.

890
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,730
Wanted one of these since I was a kid.

891
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,770
That I don't know.

892
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,640
What I know is that I'm gonna get me

893
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,070
a little Porsche one day.

894
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,110
You're going down! You're going down!

895
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,270
I'm going down, all right.

896
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,280
- Oh! - Yeah, yeah.

897
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,590
You dirty, dirty...!

898
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,040
What is that?!

899
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,270
Richard!

900
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,340
Richard, Brian's asleep ups...!

901
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,250
What is that?

902
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,650
You-You don't like it?

903
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,660
No, no, I don't.

904
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,750
And you're making the kids deaf.

905
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,120
Ah, come on, it's not that loud.

906
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,220
Yes, it is.

907
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,260
And you know what?

908
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,350
I was in my car the other day, and...

909
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,130
Where did my CDs go?

910
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,190
Wh-Where's my, where's my Peabo Bryson?

911
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,930
Where's my Usher? Where's my Beyonc?

912
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,060
You know, you really got some nigga ears, honey.

913
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,640
Nigga ears?

914
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,200
How many times do I have to ask you

915
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,080
not to talk in front of the kids like that?

916
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,380
You know what?

917
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,540
You just keep doing what you're doing.

918
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,640
'Cause one of these days,

919
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,620
they won't be asking where my daddy is,

920
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,350
they'll be asking, "Where's my nigga?"

921
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,890
Then what are you gonna do?

922
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,860
You know, I tried calling you yesterday,

923
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,120
and no one could find you.

924
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,630
Was probably at lunch.

925
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,030
No, it was almost 4:00.

926
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,200
Aren't you usually back by then?

927
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,970
I mean, I tried calling you on your cell,

928
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,970
I tried texting you, you didn't text me back.

929
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,100
What did you want?

930
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,160
What difference does it make

931
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,210
what I wanted?

932
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,640
That was yesterday.

933
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,910
You have to tell people where you are.

934
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,380
What if something happened to the kids?

935
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,920
What if I got hit by a car?

936
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,610
Ah, come on, why do you always have to take it to,

937
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,480
"What if I got hit by a car?"

938
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,110
L-I went to the deli,

939
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,350
I wanted a chicken salad sandwich.

940
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,580
L-I stood on line.

941
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,250
Uh, when I got to the front of the line,

942
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,490
I realized I didn't have a ticket,

943
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,190
so I had to get back on the line.

944
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,790
That's it.

945
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,860
You make it sound like an alibi.

946
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,490
All you have to do is answer the phone.

947
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,130
I didn't hear it.

948
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,600
All right.

949
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,470
Tomorrow.

950
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,640
Have you thought about what you want to do?

951
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,340
Do you want to see a movie?

952
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,820
Do you want to have brunch with Jennifer and Allan?

953
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,180
Nah, nah, nah, we do that all the time.

954
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,810
Let's try something different.

955
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,550
Different?

956
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,590
Okay.

957
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,710
Honey, let's go look at the new Porsches.

958
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,580
Wh... Why?

959
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,810
No. No, no, no, no.

960
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,540
In here, it says that there's something over there

961
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,640
that you're really gonna like.

962
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,210
Oh, yeah. Come on.

963
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,260
Let's go.

964
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,950
Bye-bye.

965
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,720
Come on, baby.

966
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,110
- Going to the car show and looking at the minivans

967
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,880
was like going to a strip club and looking at the DJ.

968
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,750
- Mr. Cooper,

969
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,620
what sectors have the most

970
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,660
growth potential for our company?

971
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,460
Well, Mr. Yuni, what we're finding now

972
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,590
is that most advertising dollars are migrating online.

973
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,470
Is that you?

974
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,170
It's me.

975
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,640
- I probably should, uh... - Mm-hmm.

976
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,050
- Richard, I have an emergency.

977
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,550
I need to ask you something,

978
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,380
but I'm afraid you're gonna get mad at me.

979
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,280
I have to take this.

980
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,620
Um, if you'll excuse me,

981
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,350
I'll be, I'll be right back.

982
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,530
H-Hey, what's up?

983
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,400
I can't really talk right now; I'm in a meeting.

984
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,590
Okay, really quick.

985
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,070
Just promise you won't get mad at me.

986
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,160
I won't get mad.

987
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,640
You didn't promise.

988
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,800
: Okay, I promise.

989
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,810
Will you come with me to get my stuff out ofTeddy's apartment?

990
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,850
Didn't you hear me tell you I'm in a meeting?

991
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,910
Not today,

992
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,140
tomorrow.

993
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,380
Fine.

994
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,920
Okay? I got to go now.

995
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,010
Have a good meeting.

996
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,850
- Oh, and what were your plans?

997
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,020
Three kids?

998
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,320
- Yeah, could be better.

999
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,200
Small family emergency.

1000
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,290
It's under control.

1001
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,200
- All right, so where's this guy live?

1002
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,070
'Cause I got things to do.

1003
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,610
Shuttle's in, like, 45 minutes.

1004
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,980
Shuttle?

1005
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,540
Wh-What are you talking about, shuttle?

1006
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,710
To D.C.

1007
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,580
Remember I told you, we have a place there,

1008
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,620
and he's out of town, so now I can get my shit.

1009
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,320
I'm not going with you to D.C.

1010
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,050
You promised.

1011
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,460
I didn't promise to go with you to another state.

1012
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,930
It's not a state, it's a district.

1013
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,300
It's, like, a 30-minute flight.

1014
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,700
You must be out of your fucking mind

1015
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,100
if you think I'm getting on a plane to Washington D.C.

1016
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,870
To go to some guy's house to get your shit!

1017
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,480
- Richard?

1018
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,850
Richard, yeah.

1019
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,080
Uh, I have one question for you:

1020
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,210
Where the fuck are you?

1021
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,550
No, no, no, don't worry.

1022
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,680
I'll be there.

1023
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,590
Yeah, something just came up.

1024
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,890
Look, just get here, okay?

1025
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,400
I told you I need you on this one.

1026
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,560
Tell Mary that if Nikki calls,

1027
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,690
I'll call her tomorrow.

1028
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,530
Tell her yourself when you get here.

1029
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,200
You're a good liar.

1030
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,570
Listen, we're getting on the 1:00 shuttle,

1031
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,670
not a moment later, okay?

1032
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,300
'Cause I got a meeting at 3:00.

1033
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,070
Okay.

1034
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,960
- Right here.

1035
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,050
- Here? - Uh-huh.

1036
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,660
What are all these cops doing here?

1037
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,720
Oh, it's kind of a crazy neighborhood.

1038
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,100
Something's always going down.

1039
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,860
- We'll be right back. - Okay.

1040
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,070
So how many cities have you lived in

1041
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,080
- with this Teddy guy? - Hey, police! Open up in there!

1042
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,880
- Uh, here, and New York. - Open up in there!

1043
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,350
In Miami, I lived with his brother.

1044
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,390
That's where I met him.

1045
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,750
Wait a minute, you lived with a guy,

1046
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,220
then you left him for his brother?

1047
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,350
How'd you pull that off?

1048
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,550
I got a hard enough time

1049
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,720
telling my wife I want pancakes.

1050
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,890
We're in.

1051
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,230
All right, now that we're in,

1052
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,800
I want you to get your shit

1053
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,400
and let's get out of here.

1054
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm just gonna grab a few dresses, some shoes,

1055
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,880
and then we'll go.

1056
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,240
Okay.

1057
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,440
Thank you.

1058
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,570
Forget "Thank you,"just hurry up.

1059
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,450
Teddy's doing pretty good.

1060
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,450
Mm-hmm.

1061
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,030
You were on the math team in high school?

1062
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,160
For two years. Why?

1063
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,330
I don't know.

1064
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,000
Just can't imagine you solving a problem.

1065
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,870
My Ferretti sweater.

1066
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,780
I had no idea where this was.

1067
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,320
Richard Cooper's office.

1068
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,480
Hi, Brenda.

1069
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,550
Hey, somebody around here's

1070
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,560
got some nigga ears.

1071
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,390
Excuse me?

1072
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,020
Biz Markie's Greatest Hits.

1073
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,830
That man is a genius.

1074
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,240
The genius that wrote "Pickin' Boogers."

1075
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,500
- "Pickin' Boogers," "The Vapors"

1076
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,510
And of course, my favorite...

1077
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,910
#You #

1078
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,040
#You got what I need #

1079
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,710
- # But you say he's just a friend #

1080
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,950
# But you say he's just a friend #

1081
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,880
# Oh, baby, you #

1082
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,150
#You got what I need. #

1083
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,820
Okay, Teddy, calm down.

1084
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,330
You know you got two strikes.

1085
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,700
There's cops all over the place.

1086
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,500
How the fuck y'all get in here, man?

1087
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,500
Huh?

1088
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,000
Who the fuck are you?

1089
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,340
Huh?

1090
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,340
What, this the new nigga?

1091
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,380
You fucking him now? Huh?

1092
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,240
You the new nigga, man?

1093
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,800
No, no, I'm-I'm not the new nigga.

1094
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,210
I've n-never been the nigga, I'm just a... friend.

1095
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,110
How's it going? Richard Cooper.

1096
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:10,520
Oh!

1097
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:11,820
- Teddy! - Motherfucker!

1098
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,220
Teddy, what the fuck's wrong with you?!

1099
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,350
- You bring this stupid-ass nigga - Stop it!

1100
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,450
- In my fucking crib?! - Teddy!

1101
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,790
- Fuck you! - Somebody help!

1102
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,890
- Take the boot! Take the boot! - Somebody help us!

1103
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:21,930
Take the motherfucking boot!

1104
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,730
Hi, Mr. Landis, it's Tracy.

1105
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,830
You like the taste, huh?! You like the taste?!

1106
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,240
- Everybody freeze! - You like the fucking taste?!

1107
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,530
Crunch it down, motherfucker!

1108
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,600
- Hey! Get him now! - What?!

1109
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,940
He's in a conference meeting.

1110
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,070
- - We good.

1111
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1112
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,240
This motherfucker broke into my crib...

1113
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,280
with this bitch here!

1114
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,050
Thug life! Thug life!

1115
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,880
- Thug life!

1116
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,320
Thug life, nigga! Thug life!

1117
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,760
Wait, wait, wait, we can't do this.

1118
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:49,860
- Oh, yes, we can!

1119
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,990
- Thug fucking life!

1120
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1121
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,500
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1122
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,500
He could've killed us!

1123
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,830
You told me he was out of town!

1124
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,490
- Sorry! - And the damn cops coming here!

1125
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,940
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1126
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,970
I should be in a meeting right now!

1127
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,470
No, no.

1128
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,410
No, no, no!

1129
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,810
Could you hurry up?

1130
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:39,110
I don't care about "Thriller."

1131
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,940
What kind of grown man has kids sleeping in his bed?

1132
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,880
He'll never babysit my kids.

1133
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,750
Look, we don't have all day.

1134
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,250
- I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Yuni.

1135
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,810
I'm-I'm sure Mr. Cooper will be here

1136
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,190
in a moment with the prospectus.

1137
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,690
: Where the fuck is he?

1138
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,090
I'm sure he's got a good explanation.

1139
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,360
Excuse me.

1140
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,330
George, there's a call for you in your office.

1141
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,370
Ah. Excuse me.

1142
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,070
Actually, I like "Thriller."

1143
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,570
Michael's last big one.

1144
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,610
Yeah.

1145
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,340
I knew he was gonna be a star, you know,

1146
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,540
when I saw him on Ed Sullivan.

1147
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,100
- All flights in and out

1148
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,310
of New York LaGuardia have been delayed

1149
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,180
possibly three to four hours.

1150
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,550
Thank you for your patience.

1151
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,590
George...

1152
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,810
I've been trying to cover for you.

1153
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,860
They want to start- where the fuck are you?

1154
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,890
Landis is pissed.

1155
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,860
I'm not going to make it.

1156
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,160
Oh, fuck!

1157
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,030
Fuck!

1158
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,460
Hey, Anita. How you doing?

1159
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,860
George, calm down.

1160
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,830
You can do this. You can handle it.

1161
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,300
- Just calm down. - No...

1162
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,270
Goddamn it,

1163
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,530
Richard!

1164
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,540
You're killing me!

1165
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,400
I hope she's worth it.

1166
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,120
Fuck!

1167
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,430
I'm afraid we either have to get started

1168
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,520
or we have to go.

1169
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,030
We have another appointment.

1170
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,620
Can we get started?

1171
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,760
Of course. Absolutely.

1172
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,530
Okay, um...

1173
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,970
Mr. Yuni, my apologies, uh, but I have been working very closely

1174
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,770
and I'm prepared to walk us through it.

1175
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,430
Um, if you take a look at, uh, page two...

1176
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,770
I'm sorry, page... three.

1177
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,650
Performance chart from 19...

1178
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,630
Hey, baby, you're late.

1179
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,430
What happened?

1180
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,760
 I got in a fight.

1181
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,960
Afight?

1182
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,940
What hap... Why? What happened?

1183
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,630
I was pulling the car out the lot,

1184
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,930
and this guy cut me off,

1185
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,870
and he gets out of his car, then I got out of my car,

1186
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,270
and, next thing I know, we're on the ground,

1187
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,400
- and we're... - No, stop. No, stop.

1188
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,970
That is, that's-that's the dumbest shit in the world.

1189
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,980
I can't believe your...

1190
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,150
You're a grown man! You...

1191
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,550
All right, De La Hoya, you know what?

1192
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,420
You put the dishes away, and I'm gonna go upstairs.

1193
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,890
I'm gonna pretend I'm married to a grown man.

1194
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,290
- ...breaking news, this just in.

1195
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,230
- Today, in national news, a Washington D.C. Man

1196
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,100
named Teddy Smith shot and wounded two police officers.

1197
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,100
He was later apprehended after a violent standoff.

1198
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,140
More news after the break.

1199
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,960
Shit.

1200
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,960
Cooper, you're a good banker.

1201
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,170
You've brought a lot of money to this company.

1202
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,710
Do you think you've brought a lot of money into this company?

1203
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,400
Yeah, I've-I've, I've brought some money in.

1204
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, in all the years you've been here,

1205
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,910
you've brought in close to $20 million.

1206
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,040
That's a lot of money, right?

1207
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,110
Right?

1208
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,420
L-I guess so.

1209
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,220
See this quarter?

1210
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,190
See it?

1211
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,090
Yes, I see it.

1212
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,390
This quarter is you.

1213
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,900
This is $20 million.

1214
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,430
Do you see this table?

1215
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,700
This is Pupkin & Langford.

1216
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,540
This is $800 million.

1217
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,580
This is your value to the company.

1218
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,910
You're on probation.

1219
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,850
Any more problems, you're fired.

1220
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,040
Are we clear?

1221
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,780
Yes, sir.

1222
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,450
You know, Cooper,

1223
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,080
you can lose a lot of money chasing women,

1224
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,360
but you'll never lose women chasing money.

1225
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,760
#

1226
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,310
- I got lucky.

1227
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,210
I still had myjob, I still had my family.

1228
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,410
All I had to do was one thing.

1229
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,880
Nikki is on line one.

1230
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,480
Tell her I'm not here.

1231
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,390
Sure.

1232
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,820
Sorry, he's not in right now.

1233
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,800
Nikki called twice.

1234
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,810
What should I tell her if she calls again?

1235
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,400
Just tell her I'm not here.

1236
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,880
- Way overboard.

1237
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,780
I'm not offended, I just don't...

1238
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,650
Well, you know what? You have to...

1239
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,240
Richard Cooper's office.

1240
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,350
I'm not here.

1241
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,690
He's not in the office right now.

1242
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,780
Can I take a message?

1243
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,830
Well, can you let him know that I called?

1244
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,130
Tell her I'm dead.

1245
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,600
- Okay. - Really dead.

1246
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,630
Will do, Nikki.

1247
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,630
Really dead.

1248
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,600
Yes.

1249
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,440
- The Killers?

1250
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,950
I always thought you were more of a Wu-Tang guy.

1251
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,210
Nelson?

1252
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,310
Get outta here!

1253
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,780
Long time, no see.

1254
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,180
Yeah.

1255
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,240
Same to you, Mr. Wall Street.

1256
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,260
Are you still working down at Pupkin & Langford?

1257
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,790
Yeah, l-I think I'm still there.

1258
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,090
We'll see how long that lasts.

1259
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,590
- Hmm. - So, what are you up to?

1260
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,530
Oh. Shit, nothing much.

1261
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,430
Doing a little work for the Legal Defense Fund.

1262
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,590
It's going okay.

1263
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,000
Figured I'd come in here and pick up a few CDs.

1264
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,560
Pretty soon, the only place you'll be able

1265
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,200
to buy 'em is at Starbucks.

1266
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,710
I know, and they don't sell any rap at Starbucks.

1267
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,400
I guess you want some rap, you got to go to a liquor store.

1268
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,410
Yeah, let me get a pint ofJack and thatJa Rule.

1269
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,350
Hey, guess who I saw two weeks ago- Nikki.

1270
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,910
She said she bumped into you or something, right?

1271
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she came by the office.

1272
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,050
So, how was that for you?

1273
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,110
I mean, you guys had a pretty bad breakup.

1274
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:36,520
No, no, it was actually kind of cool to see her again.

1275
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,060
I mean, if I'd ran into her

1276
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,600
without my medication, who knows?

1277
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,790
But, uh... we talked for a minute.

1278
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,530
You know, caught up.

1279
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,540
Got to tell you, Rich, man, she still look good.

1280
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,370
I mean, she's... that ... fine!

1281
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,310
She's... man, just the way she's shaped...

1282
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,540
I mean, you see her skin?! Did you... you saw her.

1283
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,670
I mean it ju-ju-just... smooth.

1284
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,650
I looked at her, I kept watching her, next thing I know,

1285
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,050
I'd been looking at her for 20 minutes.

1286
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,750
And I realized I was following her, you know what I mean?

1287
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,120
I mean, it wasn't creepy or nothing, you know.

1288
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,020
I didn't... I don't think she saw me.

1289
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,220
And I'm just gonna, you know, stay away.

1290
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,660
I'm getting my life together.

1291
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,890
Anyway, if you see Nikki, you tell her I said hello.

1292
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,800
Don't... no, don't... don't do that. Don't.

1293
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,390
It's good to see you, Rich.

1294
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,700
Hey, Richard, I have some messages for you.

1295
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,170
Did Nikki call?

1296
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,740
No, she didn't.

1297
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,720
I guess she finally got the hint.

1298
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,120
Hey.

1299
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,320
What are you doing here?

1300
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,300
Can I ask you a question?

1301
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,700
It's personal.

1302
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,260
Go right ahead.

1303
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,100
Why are you still married?

1304
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,800
I mean, you never really seemed like the marrying type, and now

1305
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,140
even though you say you're happy, I don't think you are.

1306
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,640
I'm happy. I mean, wh-when I got with Brenda,

1307
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,940
I decided to settle down.

1308
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,210
I mean, she's a great mother, and I love her.

1309
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,470
See? You don't say it right!

1310
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,070
We're gonna go through this shit again.

1311
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,480
How was I supposed to say it, Nikki?

1312
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,980
You're supposed to say that you love her

1313
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,210
and you can't live without her.

1314
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,580
You just sound indebted.

1315
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,560
You're not in love; you're in loyal.

1316
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,220
Well, at least I'm in something.

1317
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,760
At-at least I have a family.

1318
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:49,950
Wh-What do you have?

1319
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,120
Oh, don't throw that family shit at me.

1320
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,560
You and your wife, you don't talk, you don't fuck.

1321
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,430
If that's what family is, I'll wait.

1322
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,160
For what, Nikki? What are you waiting for?

1323
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,230
For the real thing.

1324
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,140
Love.

1325
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,270
Or at least a sponsor, but I'm not settling.

1326
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,470
You ever think about getting a skill?

1327
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,250
Oh, I got skills.

1328
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,850
 What are you doing here?

1329
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,220
I don't know, we're... we're friends, right?

1330
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,130
Yeah... We're friends.

1331
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,170
Come on, I got to get back to work.

1332
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,170
You should come out with me tonight.

1333
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,600
I'm not going out with you.

1334
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,700
I need you to.

1335
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,040
What for? What's going on?

1336
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,410
Well, there's this guy, he's really into me.

1337
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,600
I'm not sure what I think about him,

1338
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,770
so I want you to come and tell me what you think.

1339
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,180
After D.C., I have no desire

1340
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,680
to meet any more of your boyfriends.

1341
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,050
What, are you jealous?

1342
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,710
No. Okay, who's this guy? What's his name?

1343
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,750
Compassion.

1344
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,150
Compassion?!

1345
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,160
Wh-What? Compassion Fruit?

1346
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,920
Compassion... Luther King.

1347
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,520
Compassionate? Wh-Wh...?

1348
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,720
Compassion.

1349
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,160
Just come, it'll be a blast.

1350
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,600
You know, we'll eat onion rings till 4:00 in the morning.

1351
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,130
It'll be like old times.

1352
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,330
So, what am I gonna tell my wife?

1353
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,600
Um... I don't know.

1354
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,610
Just... start a fight.

1355
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,670
- Chicken?!

1356
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,610
Yes. What is wrong?

1357
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,810
Chicken again?

1358
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,010
We have chicken every day- I'm tired of chicken.

1359
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,380
I thought you liked chicken.

1360
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,220
I like it, but I don't like it every day.

1361
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,280
I mean, I feel like I got feathers coming out my ass.

1362
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,820
All right, this isn't about chicken,

1363
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,950
because I know you like chicken.

1364
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,320
No, no, no, you know what? You know what?

1365
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,450
You know what this is about?

1366
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,660
This is about all the other animals out there

1367
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,630
that are dying to be eaten that we don't eat!

1368
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,130
Now, have you ever heard of lamb chops?

1369
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,670
Have you ever heard of pork chops?

1370
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,330
Can a nigga get a taco?!

1371
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,530
Are you crazy?

1372
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,010
I'm losing my finger-lickin' mind right now,

1373
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,600
eating all this chicken.

1374
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,770
I can't take it anymore.

1375
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,140
Chicken hawks don't eat this much chicken.

1376
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,370
You know what? I'm gone.

1377
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,710
I can't take it! I can't take it!

1378
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,810
Wh-Where you going?

1379
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,380
To get some duck!

1380
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,600
- What the hell is wrong with me?

1381
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,600
How could I talk to Brenda like that?

1382
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,400
L-I'm losing my mind.

1383
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,100
I got to go home. Okay, next stop,

1384
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,500
I'm getting off this train

1385
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,300
and I'm gonna go home to Brenda.

1386
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,900
That's what I'm gonna do. I am going home.

1387
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,380
So, I just got off the phone with Nikki, and, um...

1388
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,780
she's running just a little bit late,

1389
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,410
but she said she is gonna be here.

1390
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,610
Late? How late?

1391
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,150
I'm not really sure, but, uh, she told me

1392
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,710
to take good care of you, and I will.

1393
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,490
So don't worry about it; she'll be here.

1394
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,690
: Excuse me.

1395
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,520
So, sh-she's gonna be here, right?

1396
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,320
She's gonna be here. Don't worry.

1397
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,040
Hi. Um...

1398
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,700
I'll have two vodka martinis.

1399
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,270
- Olive?

1400
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,680
Yeah...

1401
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,410
Chicken?

1402
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,520
Chicken, my ass.

1403
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,300
Excuse me...

1404
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,100
: Have you seen Nikki?!

1405
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,800
No, she hasn't called, but she will.

1406
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,570
Dance! There's a lot of girls here.

1407
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,770
- Can I talk to you...?

1408
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,040
Fuck this!

1409
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,780
Where is it?

1410
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,150
Boring-ass suit.

1411
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,120
: "I just wanted something different..."

1412
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,220
with your green shirt!

1413
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,260
Motherfucker!

1414
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,930
Asian women.

1415
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,770
I thought he was done with that bullshit.

1416
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,970
Did you wear it yet?

1417
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,070
Excuse me?

1418
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,580
The shirt!

1419
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,880
I sold you a shirt like, a month ago.

1420
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,890
Saks?

1421
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,420
We work at the men's section in Saks.

1422
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:14,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember you guys.

1423
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,450
You-You sold me the green shirt.

1424
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,260
Uh, what are you doing here?

1425
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,760
We're just hanging out. We come here every week.

1426
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,700
Wednesday's the best night. What are you doing here?

1427
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,700
Uh, I'm-I'm waiting for someone.

1428
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,400
Okay, well, we're gonna go smoke this.

1429
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,630
You wanna come?

1430
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,970
Uh, I really shouldn't. I shouldn't.

1431
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,570
- Come on!

1432
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,970
It's totally natural. I got it from, like, this doctor I know.

1433
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,610
All right, but just a little bit.

1434
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,340
- Come on. - Come on.

1435
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,850
Well, what kind of chicken did you cook him?

1436
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,150
He was just supposed to go out to get something to eat,

1437
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,480
and that was almost four hours ago.

1438
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,150
Did you go through his pockets?

1439
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,350
Y-Yes, I checked his pockets.

1440
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:51,330
Did you find anything on his computer?

1441
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,800
Just a little Asian porn, but nothing serious.

1442
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:58,060
I'm sure he's somewhere right now, just clearing his head.

1443
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,280
I called him.

1444
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,900
A-And he hasn't answered.

1445
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,420
Richard is a responsible guy.

1446
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,820
I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.

1447
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:23,330
Okay, yeah.

1448
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:24,730
You're probably right.

1449
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,470
Have you heard from Nikki?!

1450
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,170
I just got off the phone with her.

1451
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,680
She told me to tell you she's sorry

1452
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,510
but she's not gonna be able to make it.

1453
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,310
She's going to Miami with some guy named Compassion.

1454
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:48,220
Something about Puffy having a party.

1455
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,420
Where have you been?

1456
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,260
I'm sorry.

1457
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:35,590
Fuck "sorry."

1458
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,290
What kind of"food" did you go out to get

1459
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,930
that takes five goddamn hours?

1460
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,300
Brenda...

1461
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:44,900
Brenda shit! Don't you say my name.

1462
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,740
Are you fucking somebody?

1463
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,680
'Cause I swear to God, if I find out you're fucking somebody...

1464
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,680
It's not that; it's work. I...

1465
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,220
I lost a client, and they put me on probation.

1466
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,150
Now I wanted to tell you, but I didn't want you to get upset.

1467
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,810
Where have you been?

1468
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,520
I was at the sports bar, watching the Knick game.

1469
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,120
The game has been over.

1470
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,250
I know.

1471
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:08,230
Don't you ever do any shit like this to me again.

1472
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,770
Do you hear me?

1473
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:16,730
I don't know what's going on with you, but you fix it.

1474
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,340
I'm sorry.

1475
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:24,540
You should be.

1476
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,620
Hi, this is Nikki.

1477
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,820
I'm not here to take your call, so remember:

1478
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:40,520
Love is God, God is love. Peace.

1479
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:45,690
Nikki? Richard.

1480
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,200
I don't know what happened to you last night,

1481
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,170
and I don't really care.

1482
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,080
I'm married. You're single.

1483
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,940
Don't call me. Don't come by the office.

1484
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,380
Don't e-mail me. Don't fax me.

1485
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:04,320
Just leave me the fuck alone.

1486
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,510
You got it?

1487
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:10,420
Just leave me the fuck alone.

1488
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:12,190
Thank you.

1489
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,690
Good night.

1490
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,360
Good night, Richard.

1491
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,740
Go home, Tracy.

1492
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,170
Good night, Richard.

1493
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,740
- Uh, Cliff, tell Russell I can do the late lunch,

1494
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,400
and then we'll talk about that other thing.

1495
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,410
: Okay.

1496
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,180
Want a ride?

1497
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,220
Yeah, sure.

1498
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,550
Come on.

1499
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,760
- So, what are you gonna do?

1500
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,020
- I don't know.

1501
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:44,190
Brenda's so fucking mad, I'm scared.

1502
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,560
All right, buddy, now is damage control.

1503
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,820
I'll tell you what to do.

1504
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,330
This weekend, you get a babysitter,

1505
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,060
take your wife out to a nice dinner.

1506
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,470
- Okay. - Right?

1507
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,870
See a bullshit chick flick, whatever she wants, and you take

1508
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:59,810
one of these and you fuck your wife like you're a porn star.

1509
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,440
You keep Viagra in the glove compartment?

1510
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:05,410
Yeah, right next to the Altoids.

1511
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,040
I may not look like Brad Pitt, but I can fuck like him.

1512
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,150
Seriously, take this.

1513
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,450
Show Brenda a good time.

1514
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,930
And stay away from Nikki.

1515
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:19,520
You got a good wife.

1516
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,400
What are you doing?

1517
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,230
I got a date with the intern from the third floor.

1518
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,330
Goddamn!

1519
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,770
She's 23.

1520
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,360
Might need to take two.

1521
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,540
And you're happily married?

1522
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,710
17 years.

1523
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,980
Good night.

1524
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,040
All right.

1525
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:49,290
- I'm gonna take George's advice.

1526
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,320
Because even though he cheats on his wife and pops pills,

1527
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,230
unlike our therapist, he's married.

1528
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,430
That was incredible.

1529
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,980
I know. Fantastic.

1530
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,740
Next time, we got to take the kids.

1531
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,480
Absolutely; they'd love it.

1532
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,040
How long you think she's been out?

1533
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,590
: Hours.

1534
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:18,090
You know, sometimes I think they put her to bed.

1535
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,280
Probably. Yeah.

1536
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,050
Look, I'm gonna go check on the kids.

1537
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,030
Nah, nah, nah, nah. I'll check on the kids.

1538
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,820
I'll get rid of Rebecca, then I'll see you upstairs.

1539
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,090
Okay.

1540
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,570
Gotta go.

1541
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,410
Wow, when'd you get back?

1542
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,680
Just got back. Gotta go.

1543
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,650
Oh, the kids were really great today.

1544
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,240
I'm sure they are. Gotta go.

1545
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,840
They all went to bed about 8:30.

1546
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,850
8:30! Gotta go!

1547
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,950
It was really cute.

1548
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,490
They came up with this little song.

1549
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,820
All right. "The Gotta Go Song."

1550
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:57,190
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

1551
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,500
: Daddy loves you.

1552
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,780
Ooh!

1553
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,820
George, we got a problem.

1554
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,460
It better be a problem. It's 3:00 in the morning.

1555
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:10,730
Hey, I took that Viagra pill you gave me,

1556
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,740
took it around 11:00, and I'm still hard.!

1557
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,030
Yeah, so what's the problem?

1558
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,700
I'm still hard, George.

1559
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,240
I've been hard for four hours.

1560
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,610
This thing won't go down!

1561
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,010
Well, did you relieve yourself?

1562
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,410
Did I relieve myself?!

1563
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,170
Yes, I've come, like, three times,

1564
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,910
and I'm still hard, and it's all because of you!

1565
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,640
Who the hell are you talking to?

1566
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,720
Are you talking to some little bitch?!

1567
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:35,090
Are you... are-are you talking to some whore in my house?

1568
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,820
No, no, no, it's George, it's George.

1569
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,020
George?!

1570
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,500
What kind of down-low shit is that?

1571
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,830
Look, George, I gotta go. Uh, it's not what you think.

1572
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,830
Oh...

1573
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,100
I did this all for you.

1574
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,360
Oh, for me?

1575
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,240
I wanted to have great sex with you,

1576
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,000
so I got a Viagra pill from George,

1577
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,510
and I came upstairs,

1578
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,170
and you were sound asleep.

1579
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,040
And I've just been hard for, like, four hours.

1580
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,340
You've been hard for four hours?

1581
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,110
Honey, you gotta help... you gotta, you gotta, you go...

1582
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,950
Don't... Keep that thing away from me.

1583
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:04,590
What are you doing?

1584
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,020
You know what that commercial says.

1585
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:07,890
Well, i-if you've taken a Viagra and you've had an erection

1586
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,820
for longer than four hours, then you call a physician.

1587
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,050
I'm calling Dr. Caruthers.

1588
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,820
It's 3:00 in the morning.

1589
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,450
I know, and he's... and he's not in.

1590
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,500
Okay, so-so what are we gonna do?

1591
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,930
Okay, about how much longer before we get to the hospital?

1592
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,270
About 15 minutes, sir.

1593
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,100
Are you sure you only took one?

1594
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,510
Honey, honey, if you took more than one, just say something.

1595
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,740
L-I just took one, okay? That's it!

1596
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,480
No, this ice isn't working.

1597
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,920
Wh-What do you mean, the ice isn't working?!

1598
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:39,080
How's your eyesight? Is it clear? Is it blurry?

1599
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,420
Uh... it's a little blurry.

1600
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:43,150
It's a little blurry. Wh-What's that mean?

1601
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,750
Could mean nothing, or it could mean you're going blind.

1602
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:49,160
You're suffering from severe priapism. I don't think we have time to wait.

1603
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,220
I'm gonna have to do something about this now.

1604
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,560
- What's going on?!

1605
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,930
I'm going to have to perform a therapeutic aspiration.

1606
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,670
Oh, my God. You-You sure?

1607
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,610
A-A-A th-thera what?!

1608
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,900
Therapeutic aspiration.

1609
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm gonna stick this needle into the side of your penis

1610
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,010
and draw blood directly from the cavernosa.

1611
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,550
Get the fuck out of here!

1612
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,410
- Shh! - I promise you, it won't hurt.

1613
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,850
- You'll just feel a pinch. - Brenda, Brenda!

1614
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,890
Hold him down.

1615
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,080
Oh... no, no!

1616
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,710
No, no!

1617
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:14,780
- Yes! Yes! - No, no, no.

1618
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,950
It's not gonna hurt. Don't worry about it.

1619
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,960
Pull over, pull over.

1620
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,930
No, no!

1621
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,860
: No!

1622
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,400
- After all my drama,

1623
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,270
looking at other women just made me mad.

1624
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,470
Look at her.

1625
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,780
She should do that shit at home.

1626
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,150
Fuckin'skank.

1627
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,440
And look at this one-

1628
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,080
send an e-mail, slut.

1629
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,490
Nobody wants to talk to you.

1630
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,150
And look at this one.

1631
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:53,560
Okay, I'm not mad at her.

1632
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,430
I mean, who could be mad at her?

1633
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,090
But I'm not gonna look.

1634
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:59,900
I'm gonna just keep on going

1635
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:02,200
'cause I am done making stupid mistakes.

1636
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,040
From now on, it's family first.

1637
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:45,340
- All right, we're gonna start with these accounts

1638
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,480
and then work our way to the new ones.

1639
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:50,080
You better order in, 'cause we got a lot of work to do.

1640
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,060
Miss me?

1641
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,820
- If she had called,

1642
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,290
I could have hung up on her, no problem.

1643
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,630
But seeing her in person so close, I was defenseless.

1644
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,230
- I have a fianc now.

1645
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,530
Sean.

1646
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:12,300
Get out of here.

1647
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,340
You're getting married?

1648
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,670
Yeah.

1649
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,010
Nikki Tru is walking down the aisle?

1650
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,050
I'm closing the deal.

1651
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,880
Sean is in real estate.

1652
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:21,980
What happened?

1653
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,990
Uh...

1654
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:25,390
I was at this party.

1655
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,080
I was talking to this guy-

1656
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,650
I don't even remember what we were talking about-

1657
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,420
and... this little

1658
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,190
22-year-old girl walks by.

1659
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,860
And he was like, "Oh, excuse me, I got to..."

1660
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,240
Then it hit me.

1661
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,640
You know, I'm 32 years old.

1662
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,680
I'm the old bitch at the club now.

1663
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,440
Think it was

1664
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,500
the first time in my life I was talking to a man

1665
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,570
who wasn't even thinking about fucking me.

1666
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,850
So, then I met Sean.

1667
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,690
And I said to myself, I got to make this work.

1668
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,520
So we're getting married in June.

1669
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,920
And I want you to meet him.

1670
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,460
Wow.

1671
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:06,660
Let me get this.

1672
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,430
You always get it.

1673
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,800
You sure?

1674
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:12,430
Yeah, I'm sure.

1675
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,170
Ah! Almost got you!

1676
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,770
Daddy's gonna get you.

1677
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,470
- : Hey. - Hey.

1678
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:25,480
How was work?

1679
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:27,280
Pretty good. Uh, remember Nikki?

1680
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,510
She-she came by today.

1681
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,880
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1682
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,180
Yeah, she's getting married to some guy.

1683
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,550
Great.

1684
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,780
Yeah, I hope he has insurance.

1685
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,360
Uh, Rebecca and Brian

1686
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,160
- are waiting for you. - Thank you.

1687
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:41,790
I'm gonna get Kelly.

1688
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,480
- Yeah, I am so glad

1689
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,540
you two are making such progress.

1690
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,350
I wasn't sure we'd make it this far.

1691
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,250
Yeah, I just decided to stop complaining

1692
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,880
about all the things I didn't have

1693
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,520
and start appreciating the things I did.

1694
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,420
That is what I want to hear from both of you:

1695
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:14,260
Getting along and appreciating what you have.

1696
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,860
So, how are things physically?

1697
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,870
Oh, well, um,

1698
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,300
well, well, we're not quite having sex yet.

1699
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,600
Um, but-but, hey, we are getting along,

1700
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,110
and-and it's not all about sex, right?

1701
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:30,610
Yeah, l-I, I'm not complaining.

1702
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,380
Uh, I'm just trying to appreciate

1703
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:35,650
the non-sex that we're having.

1704
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,620
You know, you don't have to have sex

1705
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:39,680
to show somebody you love them.

1706
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,220
I see.

1707
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,130
What you writing?

1708
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,720
Oh, nothing.

1709
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,980
Guys, I am so sorry I'm late.

1710
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,310
Something came up at the office.

1711
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,350
Not a problem.

1712
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,980
Richard, this is Sean.

1713
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,250
Sean, Richard.

1714
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,120
Nikki tells me you work at Pupkin & Langford.

1715
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,550
Do you know Matt Landis?

1716
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:14,650
Yeah, that's my boss.

1717
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,120
Ah! I feel sorry for you.

1718
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:18,520
Well, next time you see him,

1719
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,390
- tell him Sean Waters said hello. - Yeah.

1720
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,760
I wish you would've shown up earlier.

1721
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,060
You know, I have to go and take care of a few things.

1722
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,500
Will you call me when you're done?

1723
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:28,730
- Yes. - Okay.

1724
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,140
- Nobu at 9:00.

1725
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,440
- Mm-hmm. - Don't be late.

1726
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,500
I won't be.

1727
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,840
Richard, next time you're in Malibu, look us up.

1728
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,710
Bring your wife; we'll all go out to dinner.

1729
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,240
Oh, that's a great idea, babe.

1730
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,290
This is what you want?

1731
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,330
You're getting married.

1732
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,420
Do you love him?

1733
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,230
Do I love him?

1734
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,860
In a few years, maybe.

1735
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,230
I'm gonna be like you.

1736
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,890
You know, I'm gonna have a nice house,

1737
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:04,030
a nice husband, couple kids-

1738
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:07,300
a nice, easy, dull, boring life.

1739
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,970
And I will never again have to live

1740
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,910
in a tiny-ass studio apartment.

1741
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,880
Come on. Don't-don't hurt the guy.

1742
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:15,850
What do you care?

1743
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,720
You hurt?

1744
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,550
Don't go there.

1745
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,560
You started it.

1746
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,250
Do I love him?

1747
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,890
You know, we could be really happy together,

1748
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,990
you and me.

1749
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,930
Don't you want to be happy?

1750
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,600
My life's not about

1751
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,500
what... I want.

1752
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:40,370
I hear ice cracking.

1753
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,440
Careful not to drown, Richie.

1754
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,120
So, Sean leaves for L.A. In the morning.

1755
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:53,780
I don't leave till Wednesday.

1756
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,220
So why don't you come by tomorrow

1757
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:57,230
and we can have a proper good-bye?

1758
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,560
Y-You know, Nikki, I'm-I'm not sure.

1759
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:04,360
I will call you with the address,

1760
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,660
and I will see you at 2:00.

1761
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,340
#

1762
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,880
Richard?

1763
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:25,680
Baby, you up?

1764
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,720
Hmm?

1765
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,920
- When I woke up this morning,

1766
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,690
I had no idea what I was going to do.

1767
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,920
You know, some people say life is short

1768
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,400
and that you could get hit by a bus at any moment

1769
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:40,900
and that you have to live each day like it's your last.

1770
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,270
Bullshit.

1771
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,700
Life is long.

1772
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:46,330
You're probably not gonna get hit by a bus,

1773
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:47,810
and you're gonna have to live

1774
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,870
with the choices you make for the next 50 years.

1775
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,750
- You know, their numbers were pretty good last year.

1776
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,410
I always thought that was a good buy.

1777
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,150
But that's just me.

1778
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,710
Sure, we could buy every day.

1779
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:02,220
Uh, Lowenstein at Poco.

1780
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,780
He speaks Japanese, and he's gay.

1781
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,260
I only say that 'cause I took him to Scores last Tuesday,

1782
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:08,920
disaster, all right?

1783
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,560
See what you can do.

1784
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:13,300
Uh, all right, big guy wants us all to concentrate on EuroTech.

1785
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:16,530
And nobody talks to them except me and Richard.

1786
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,570
You got it.

1787
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,580
All right.

1788
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,210
- When two people admit

1789
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,440
that they're attracted to each other,

1790
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,280
they're no longer in control.

1791
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:31,380
The relationship has to play itself out,

1792
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,010
for better or for worse.

1793
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,430
Where's he going?

1794
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,520
Lunch, Tracy.

1795
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,280
Thank you.

1796
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,270
Uh, excuse me...

1797
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:04,980
Uh-huh?

1798
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:09,080
Do you have any condoms?

1799
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,630
Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

1800
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,460
Condoms.

1801
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:14,960
Oh, condoms! Sure.

1802
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,290
What kind you want?

1803
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:18,160
Quiet ones.

1804
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,640
Let me just get the blue.

1805
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,500
Three-pack or 12-pack?

1806
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,130
Three.

1807
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,900
12-pack is cheaper.

1808
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,070
Look... 

1809
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:29,270
Can you just get me some fucking condoms?

1810
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:33,480
I don't have change of a $20.

1811
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,520
Hey, Bob!

1812
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,280
You have change of a $20?

1813
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,980
You got to have change of a $20.

1814
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,680
Bob, the man needs his condoms!

1815
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,050
You know what? Just keep it.

1816
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,060
- Well... - Just keep it.

1817
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,090
Well...

1818
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,550
Nikki?

1819
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,610
- I'm in here.

1820
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,330
You're here.

1821
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,340
I thought you might get scared and not show up.

1822
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,400
Scared?

1823
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,470
Scared of what?

1824
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,810
I don't know.

1825
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,310
Just scared.

1826
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,110
You want to help me with this?

1827
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,170
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1828
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,240
Sure, I'll help you.

1829
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:47,820
Ooh, ooh. Sorry.

1830
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:51,380
It's all right, just...

1831
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:54,450
It's okay. It's okay.

1832
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,120
Okay.

1833
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:02,000
Just got here and you're putting me to work.

1834
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:13,610
I think... I got it.

1835
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:16,610
No.

1836
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,150
Not yet.

1837
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,920
But you will.

1838
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,420
You like my shoes?

1839
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,890
You're wearing shoes?

1840
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,060
Yeah, I like them.

1841
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:32,360
You mind if I keep them on?

1842
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,630
Go right ahead.

1843
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:45,280
What are you doing all the way over there?

1844
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,210
Thought you weren't scared.

1845
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,270
I'm just taking it all in.

1846
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,380
You look real good, Nikki.

1847
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,980
Why don't you take it all in a little closer?

1848
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,620
I'm not gonna bite.

1849
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,760
I'm gonna miss you.

1850
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:12,800
Gonna miss you, too.

1851
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,810
So what are you waiting for?

1852
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,770
Wait, wait, wait.

1853
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:53,820
Take your clothes off.

1854
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,660
What?

1855
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,570
What?

1856
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:21,900
Richard?

1857
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:28,480
What?

1858
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:29,750
No, it's okay.

1859
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,750
Sweetheart, it's okay.

1860
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,980
S... What are you...?

1861
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:32,990
Richard, stop it!

1862
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,680
No, st... What are you doing?!

1863
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,320
Richard! Richard!

1864
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,020
- Life is about choice.

1865
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,960
We're all the sum of our choices.

1866
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:47,400
And most of them are made for us.

1867
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:50,200
You can't choose when you're born.

1868
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,260
You can't choose where you're born.

1869
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:55,070
You can't choose your family.

1870
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,610
You can't even choose who you love.

1871
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,670
But you can choose how you love.

1872
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,770
Richard.

1873
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,870
Are you okay?

1874
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,540
Yeah, yeah, l-I'm fine.

1875
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:31,410
Oh, honey, what are you doing home so early?

1876
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,570
Where are the kids?

1877
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,880
I just dropped them off at my mother's house.

1878
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:36,380
Hey, you're scaring me.

1879
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,940
What... What's going on?

1880
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:41,490
I missed you.

1881
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,250
I miss you, too.

1882
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:45,660
What's happening to us?

1883
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:48,600
I don't know.

1884
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,830
I feel like it's my fault

1885
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,630
that we're not as close as we used to be.

1886
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,690
Ah, it's-it's not your fault. It's my fault.

1887
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:57,470
I'm not doing everything I'm supposed to do.

1888
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:58,910
Is it too late?

1889
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,840
I don't know.

1890
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,340
You know, baby,

1891
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:04,570
I just want to tell you

1892
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:07,950
how sorry I am for being so cold.

1893
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:10,040
It's not like I don't like being married.

1894
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,780
It's just that sometimes it feels like

1895
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:14,410
the walls are closing in on me.

1896
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:15,720
Now, hold on one minute.

1897
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:17,820
Whatever you did, you did to yourself.

1898
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:19,120
'Cause I been running around here,

1899
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,750
trying to make a nice life for us,

1900
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:22,760
taking care of the kids, being Everywoman.

1901
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:23,800
But lately...

1902
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:26,930
#You've been cold as ice #

1903
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,300
# So cold. #

1904
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:29,360
So have you.

1905
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,600
Oh, grow up.

1906
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:31,870
You know it's true.

1907
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,030
Look...

1908
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:36,480
I know none of this is easy, but I miss us.

1909
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,340
I miss what we had.

1910
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:40,910
I miss it to the core, and I just need to know...

1911
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:45,180
# How come we don't fuck anymore? #

1912
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,650
You the one on strike!

1913
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,120
# It's been a mighty long time #

1914
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,660
You out of your fucking mind!

1915
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:52,850
Careful, nigga.

1916
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:53,950
Baby, I still want you.

1917
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:56,060
And I've wanted you for so long.

1918
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:58,160
But every time I touch you...

1919
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:02,970
#You act like I did something wrong #

1920
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,870
- # No, I don't # - Yes, you do!

1921
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,370
I don't want to leave.

1922
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,700
# Neither do I #

1923
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,340
I still want you!

1924
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,570
# I'm gonna cry #

1925
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,010
Where are the kids?!

1926
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,310
I told you, they're gone.

1927
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,650
# In that case, we should be making love #

1928
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,450
#All night long, all night long #

1929
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,490
# Hee... #

1930
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,490
#All #

1931
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,430
- # Night long... #

1932
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,240
- When I told Nikki that my life

1933
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:36,140
wasn't about what I wanted, I lied.

1934
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,900
I'm not that unselfish.

1935
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,030
I know exactly what I want.

1936
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,580
I want a woman that'll not only

1937
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,700
fight with me, but who'll fight for me.

1938
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:45,340
A woman I can go to war with,

1939
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:48,110
who'll drag me and my kids out alive.

1940
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,210
A woman that can see the good in me

1941
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:51,690
when I can't even see it in myself.

1942
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:55,550
You know, Nikki was a great fantasy,

1943
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,750
but in reality...

1944
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:58,950
I think I love my wife.
