357
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,386
Yeah, they've added
this "After The Cut"

358
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,488
part of the show I was on.

359
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,724
Oh yeah, I read about that,

360
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,026
where they follow
around the losers.

361
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,561
Oh well, kinda.

362
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,229
I mean, I guess there
was like this fan outrage

363
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,531
and they were like Kay, Kay,

364
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:31,866
put Kay back on the show.

365
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,303
And so I'm one of the
stars of the show now.

Congrats dude.

367
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,540
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,312
Well I have a kid now.

370
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:49,517
Wow.

371
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:54,055
Well you did it, good for you.

372
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:55,156
Thanks Nan.

373
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,492
Too bad you've turned
into shitty a friend.

374

Did you get any of my messages?

375

I'm sorry, what, when?

376

'Cause I'm curious why you
wouldn't call me just once

379

maybe when I got pregnant
or maybe when John left me

getting me pregnant

pushed the baby out.

right now, Kay?

in the "Pop Star
Now!" season finale?

Will it be Jack or
will it be Bethany?

her humble community.

I mean it washed
out your skin tone

434
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:17,925
and it just made you
look 10 years older

than you actually are.

What happened?

Well she started wearing
a bra at nine years old

441

and she got her first pube 10.

So no, it's not hard to believe

she let her boot pop
out my by accident.

what have we here?

535
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, for three prosthetics

536
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,236
and two liver transplants.

537
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,905
How 'bout that?

538
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:00,709
Unbelievable, doing Lord's work

539
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:04,512
and I'm also very excited
for this year's theme.

540
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:08,482
Just busted about it,
it's Easter Extravaganza.

541
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,719
[Clive] Yes, yes!

542
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,253
Isn't that fantastic?

543
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:16,290
And I'd like to first
announce that the lead role

544
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:21,028
in this production
will be played by

545
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:24,131

playing Jesus Christ.

546
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,466
[everyone claps]

547
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:27,268
Don't let it get to your head.

548
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:31,171
But we also have a very
special guest joining us

549
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,141
and that's our very
own little Kay,

550
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:37,878
but you may know her from
her program, "Pop Star Now!".

551
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,913
Whoo, I love you, Kay.

552
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,818
All right, now before we
pass out the song order,

553
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:47,555
I've asked Kay to
just help us out

554
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,190
by starting us off
with a few pointers,

555
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:52,893
some professional pointers.

556
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:54,729
So if you would.

557
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,564
Well hi, everybody.

558
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:00,801
Well does anyone have
any questions to start?

559
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,936
Did you pull your
boob out on purpose?

560
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,572
Okie dokie, all
right, you know what?

561
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,774
Let's just dive in,

562
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,875
I think is best
with the song order.

563
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:10,110
I'm gonna do that right now.

564
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,080
I worked very carefully on,

565
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:16,250
we have five numbers
total as per usual

566
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:18,753
starting with the
opening number,

567
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:21,989
that's the group
number, I love so much.

568

♪ Easter has Sprung. ♪

569
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:26,093
- Love that song.
- Yay!

570
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:27,995
And then we're
gonna go to, well,

571
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:31,065
I'm gonna come out
and welcome the crowd.

572
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,433
It's a big crowd pleaser

573
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,569
and then we're gonna
have Holly and Mick

574
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:37,806
do their percussion
experimental duet.

575
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,542
Usually I sing a solo there,

576
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,109
but I'm on vocal rest.

577
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,612
So I'm doing a
percussion duet instead.

578
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,648
I play nine instruments.

579
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:50,984
She does and then after that,

580
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,822
we're gonna go to Anna's solo

581
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:57,157
and then we'll move into the
last supper slash crucifixion,

582
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,192
blah, blah, blah,

583
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:00,094
and then we're
gonna end with Kay.

584
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:01,362
So any questions?

585
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:06,100
Terrific, let the
play practice begin.

586
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:12,172
I'm so proud of all of you.

587
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,307
Oh goodness, it was that,

588
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,042
how was the volume
on that, Colin?

589
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,644
[Colin] That was
good, I got you.

590
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,145
Now as far as distance goes,

591
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:20,981
like is that, I know a lot
of times like in theater,

592
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,684
you should be far away, right?

593
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,418
But I think it's
more intimate right,

594
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,886
when you're doing television.

595
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,921
- Well you probably know, Kay.
- Yeah.

596
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:29,323
[Colin] Can get you like this.

597
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,158
- OKay.
- It's not bad.

[Miriam] Where's my glass?

599
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,074
[Holly] Are you gonna
be here the whole time?

600
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,308
[Colin] Maybe.

601
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,247
I'm super happy
you're doing this.

602
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,381
Yeah, sure.

603
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:57,852
When we started
selling tickets

604
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:59,353
and when we announced
that, you know,

605
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,954
you'd be part of the show,

606
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,090
we sold like almost
half of them already.

607
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:04,124
Can you believe it?

608
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:05,225
Pretty amazing.

Not yet.

any resurrection ballads

Well maybe you
could write one.

Oh yeah, right.

615
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:23,812
I was wondering, do
you ever get nervous?

616
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:26,313
I do, I always get nervous.

617
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:29,851
Nothing like being on
TV though, am I right?

618
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,920
Well, I guess on,

619
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,420
I guess when I sang on
the first live episode,

620
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:37,090
I was nervous 'cause I puked,
but like nerves are funny.

621

I mean, what's the
worst that can happen?

622
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,629
Well, they could not like you

623
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:44,498
and maybe vote you off the show.

624
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:45,867

after my mum had to go.
