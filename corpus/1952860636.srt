00:44:04,782 --> 00:44:07,175
to find a family
that's willing to take all four...

679
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,872
Wait a second. This just can't happen.
They need to go to the same...

680

They need to go to the same family.

681
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,846
Mrs. Danville,
you were the one on the phone to me

682
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,583
about the children becoming attached
and how it was too painful

683
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,320
-for you to deal with it...
-Look, I need this to happen the right way,

684
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,157
and I just don't have time for this,
I just don't.

685
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,459
-Sal.
-No, look, Jason,

686
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,364
I have an opportunity to go on tour.
Do you know what that could mean?

687
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,526
Why didn't you tell me?

688
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,762
Cause everything is out of control.

I'd really like them back
the way they used to be, you know?

00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:41,008
-Sally and I need to talk about this.
-I can see that.

-What is this about a tour?
-Klay's got something lined up for me.

-Don't act so excited for me.
-It's not that.

-It's...
-What is it?

It's just...
I told you I met with General Lindford.

00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,417
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
I was a little out of it.

He wants me to fly again.

698

I thought you said
you'd never fly again.

In terms of dollars,
that's true. It's true.

What if there's a remote possibility
that I can actually make it?

710

Have you thought of that,
maybe I can actually make it?

-For everything that I have done?

Yes, sir. I like football.

He drives racecars.

I'm a dad, too,
so I'm pretty happy about that.

854

He took first place 21 times.

I've been lucky, all right.

I had to write a paper in school

about an imaginary character
named Roxy the Midnight Hairdresser.

874
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,028
And in your sleep,
she comes to visit you,

875
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,962
and she lands on your head
and she does a little dance.

876
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,902
When you wake up,
you have a fancy little hairdo.

He'd show me different plants and...

901

He taught me about all kinds of things.

902

For example?

903
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,845
Like the right way
to eat seasonal grasshoppers

904

1057

You know, we were together a lot because
we all helped them out in the villages

1058
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:46,513
and we delivered food and medicine

1059
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:51,390
and Mom and I never had any time together.

1060
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,496

1061

I told her what I really wanted
when I turned 16,

1062
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,905

was just one day,

01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,926
Go ahead, kids. So, Christine...

1180
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:56,961
JORDAN: Are you okay?

1181
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:58,768
KALEB: Are you okay?
JORDAN: What happened?

1182
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,668
There was a message on your phone.

1183
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,674
He found out you're going to
send them all away to another family.

1184
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:08,010
And... Well...

1185
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,981
-Come on, it's okay.
-Just tell us, it's all right.

1186
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,045
He... He thought
you cared more about him than that.

1187
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,520
DOROTHY: Mr. and Mrs. Danville.

1188
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,060
-SALLY: Hi.
-Is Javier all right?

1189
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:21,786
-Yeah, he's going to be fine.
-He's going to be okay.

1190
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:25,458
-Oh. Thank goodness.
-Did you leave us a message?

1191
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,134
Yeah, you didn't get it?

1192
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,770
We found the perfect family.
They'll take all four.

1193
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,363
Transition is set for this weekend.

1194
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,568
No, we didn't get it, but Javier did.

1195
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,348
Oh, I see.

1196
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:46,843
Dorothy, we are happy to tell you
we don't need a transition.

1197
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:51,489
We want to adopt the kids
and make it official.

1198
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,257
DOROTHY: Oh, that's impossible now.
JASON: Why is that impossible?

1199
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,523
Yeah, I mean, you begged us
to take these kids and now we want to.

1200
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,830
-We're ready.
-That was before.

1201
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:02,461
Before what?

1202
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,529
I explained all of this to you
after the first incident.

1203
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,939
I warned you. I was serious, I meant it.

1204
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,568
Look, Javier, he was just upset
and he didn't know...

1205
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,670
DOROTHY:
Mrs. Danville, we cannot allow it.

1206
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,639
-Allow what?
-Yeah, I mean...

1207
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:19,016
We've become a family now.
We love these children.

1208
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,055
We want to make it official.

1209
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,816
That is not the issue.

1210
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:25,883
Family Services cannot take a risk,
and you two are a risk.

1211
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,250
No, we're not.

1212
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,661
JASON: Oh, come on, nobody starts out
being a perfect parent.

1213
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,130
You need practice, you make mistakes,

1214
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,690
and then, you know, sometimes you blow it...

1215
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,133
Yes, and both of you have done all of that.

1216
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:39,332
Now, I can't agree with your proposal,
and if you attempt it,

1217
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,466
I'll have to fight you in a court of law.

1218
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,410
Look, Dorothy, listen.
You know, when we all started with this,

1219
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,917
we were just concerned
about the inconvenience in our lives,

1220
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:54,027
about our careers and our relationship,
but these kids,

1221
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:58,484
they changed everything and just set us
on a completely different path.

1222
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,085
Better path, you know,
beyond our narrow vision.

1223
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,859
Yeah,
we're ready just to give it all away

1224
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,799
instead of taking it for ourselves,
and we mean that.

1225
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,037
All good feelings aside,

1226
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:14,433
there's no evidence that you two can
deal with this enormous responsibility.

1227
01:20:14,528 --> 01:20:15,528
We can.

1228
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:17,607
Now all four children are to be remanded

1229
01:20:17,608 --> 01:20:20,073
into Family Services protective custody

1230
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,207
-pending placement.
-You can't do this.

1231
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,573
Excuse me.

1232
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:25,611
Hello, Jordan.

1233
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,246
My mother and father taught me
to speak my mind.

1234
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,819
Yes, that's a good thing.

1235
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,724
You think you know
the right thing to do, but you don't.

1236
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:38,432
You have no idea how hard
Sally and Jason have tried

1237
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,831
to be good parents.

1238
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,431
It was an obligation at first,
we could tell that.

1239
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,639
But it's different now.

1240
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,402
Javier didn't do what he did
because they were bad parents,

1241
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:54,880
he did it because he was...
He loved them.

1242
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,214
And he was upset because
he thought that they didn't love him.

1243
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,778
But we all know that's not true.

1244
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,553
And we all love them.

1245
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,628
And we won't live with anyone else no
matter what you intend to do in court.

1246
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:14,794
-I appreciate your feelings, honey, but...
-Wait, wait, wait.

1247
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,974
There's a reason Sally was on that list.

1248
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,977
My mother believed in her,

1249
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,809
trusted her with her most sacred possessions.

1250
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:30,879
Out of respect for that,
for my mother and father,

1251
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:34,080
will you please reconsider
and not fight against it?

1252
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:51,161
Can you appreciate how sincerely
our department considers

1253
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,901
the welfare of children, because
nothing else really matters, you know.

1254
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:56,139
-Look, Dorothy, I...
-I listened to Jordan.

1255
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,475
I feel the looks on these faces,
and there's no question.

1256
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,352
The welfare of these children

1257
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:12,015
could never be placed
in more capable or loving hands.

1258
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,118
Your case is closed.

1259
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,928
-Really?
-Oh. Thank you, thank you!

1260
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,023
SALLY: Oh, yay!

1261
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,931
-Come here.
-Oh, my God.

1262
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,403
JAVIER: I'm sorry about the car, man.
JASON: Don't worry about the car, pal.

1263
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,698
SALLY: You okay?

1264
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,644
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1265
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,146
I'm telling you what,
these dancers from China were awesome.

1266
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:45,556
All right, so listen.
I'm seeing a lot of familiar faces.

1267
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,686
You're here every year,
I'm here every year,

1268
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:51,254
we all come for the same reason,
to celebrate the family of man, right?

1269
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,857
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1270
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,334
This festival is definitely
near and dear to my heart,

1271
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:58,167
and I tell you what,
we have a girl that is a late entry,

1272
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,003
but she is definitely someone
I'm sure you're gonna love.

1273
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,176
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1274
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:06,179
for Sally Danville and Plane Truth.

1275
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,306
(ALL CHEERING)

1276
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,358
Thank you so much,
it's so great to be here.

1277
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,692
I just want to thank Randy Jackson,
I want to thank my manager Klay,

1278
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:27,158
but I really just want to thank
my husband Jason.

1279
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:31,602
And this next song, it's brand new
and I wrote it for my family.

1280
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,296
(LAUGHS)

1281
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,808
Wow, my family, so...

1282
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:41,648
Here we go, I hope you like it.

1283
01:26:18,878 --> 01:26:23,128
