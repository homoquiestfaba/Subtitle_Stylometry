I hear most often

446
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:59,655
around my congregation is,

447
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:04,181
"Reverend, how do you
keep the faith?"

448
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:07,489
In these troubled,
turbulent times with chaos

449
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:11,101
and confusion, where our morals
are under assault,

450
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:15,758
our values,
our very code of existence

451
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:18,848
is under threat of extinction.

452
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,416
How does one keep the faith?

453
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,332
Well, it's very simple,
gentlemen,

454
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,117
I grasp them by the hand and

455
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:29,293
I look into the eyes,

456
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,557
and I tell them,

457
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,256
"I read the bible."

458
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,781

to an instruction manual

459
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,001
as a bible.

460
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,917

461

baseball stats.

00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:50,097

463
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,882
Our bible is not complete.

464
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:56,538
Our bible is open-ended.

465
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,758
It's more than a guideline

466
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,804
with rules and regulations
for living.

467
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,024
It's our imagination.

468
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:07,506

of our life.

Very powerful speech, Reverend.

489
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:03,170
Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it,
not too heavy-handed, I hope?

490
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:07,043
Oh, no, no,
spoken like a believer,
a true believer, Reverend.

491
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:09,393
Well, there's words of wisdom
for all of us in the bible,

492
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,047
even the naysayers.

493
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:14,268
So, how is the convention this
year, as informative as ever?

494
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:18,228
Oh, yeah... you know,
every year is a new angle,

495
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:21,405
but this year, I-I think we're
really getting up to speed,

496
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:24,713
and, uh, I'm happy to say that
my men are right on top of it.

497
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,062
We're not quitters.

498
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,411
Well, it's like my father
said to me,

499
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,152
"Arthur, the day you quit
the bible business

500
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:32,547
is the day the good Lord
tells you it's quitting time."

501
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,637

is not making a nuisance
of himself this morning!

Where's your brother?

509
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,523
Well, Herman's been ill.
He retired a few months ago.

510
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:55,918
So he's no longer with
the company, I'm sorry to say.

511
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:58,486
Sorry to hear that.
Bill did not inform me of that.

512
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:01,358

your fellow workers?

686
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,716
You owe them an apology.

687
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,805
Hell, it's a game of golf,
for Christ sakes.

688
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,939
No. It's a game of life.

689
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:35,290
Those guys have been working
their butts off for years.

690
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:38,163
They're the ones that've
been putting the clothes
on Jenny's back

691
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:40,121
and the food on her plate

692
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:44,299
while you were out playing
around on the golf links,
for Christ sakes.

693
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:46,475
Now go and apologize to them.

694
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,088
I wasn't trying to embarrass
you, or them for that matter.

695
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,178
You think you're real smart,
don't you?

696
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:56,006
Hell, I didn't even wanna
come to Vegas, you made me!

697
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,487
That's right,
and you work for me.

698
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:00,315
And you're gonna learn
this is the job,

699
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,058
the same way I did, the same way
everybody in this company does,

700
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,538
from the ground up!

701
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,888
Well, that's just fine.
Let me get the fuck outta here.

702
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,543
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talk-- Come back here!

703
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,153
Okay.

704
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:16,592
Okay, well, yeah, we'll talk
about it when I get back, okay?

705
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,594
Alright, well...

706
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:21,249
Do the best you can.

707
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,294
Yeah.

708
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:26,254
Okay, well...
I love you, too.

709
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,213
You know what
I don't understand?

710
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:32,739
I've been hearing a lot
of grumbling around camp
since we got to Las Vegas.

711
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:35,698
Now, I never told you guys
to bring your picnic baskets

712
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:38,092
and your kazoos, did I?

713
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,964
But if there's anybody unhappy
here, just let me know,

714
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,445
and I'll get you a ticket
on the first Greyhound bus

715
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,012
out of the town.

716
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:49,495
I've been doing some research
into this territory,

717
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,758
and I gotta tell ya, fellas,

718
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,369
the possibilities are endless.

719
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,243
We got trailer homes,

720
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,463
or parks,
whatever you wanna call them.

721
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:03,248
Hundreds of 'em.

722
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,075
Thousands of people.

723
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,468
Good people.

724
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,122
Honest people.

725
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,993
God-fearing folks.

726

727
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:14,824
Yeah, and we've got
what they want.

728
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:17,479
Oh, what,
what makes you think, uh,

729
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:19,264
these people
in the trailer parks

730
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,614
are gonna be able
to afford our products?

731
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:24,704
Trailer parks,
motels in Pomona,

732
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,488
what's the difference?

733
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:30,231
We're fortunate to be talking
about Americans here.

734
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:34,235
Poor people who are too proud
to admit that they're poor.

735
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,325
Listen, we got what they want,
and if they like it,

736
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,022
they're gonna buy.

737
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:43,723
Now, tomorrow, we work.
Tonight, we play poker.

Hey, you didn't get much sleep
last night, huh?

741

[clears throat]
Those flashbacks, they, uh...

742
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,744
They're coming on stronger now.

00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,008
What are you goin' on about?

744
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:12,142
Remember that lump in my...
neck, the back of my neck, uh,

745
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:15,145
it's tellin' you about it,
it's gettin' bigger.

746
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:18,236
It's about the size
of a small golfball now.

747
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,890
A small golfball?

748
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,892
Yeah, and...

749
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:26,069
Every time I start
thinking about it,

750
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,898
I start remembering stuff.

751
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:30,683
You remember what?

752
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:35,078
Stuff, you know,
stuff from my past.

753
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,690
Like Lamar Wood.

754
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:42,999
I-- I remembered three
straight months last night.

755
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,307
Every day,

756
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,309
every incident.

757
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,922
It's like my life is passing
in front of my eyes.

758
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:56,143
Wh-- Wait a minute,
who the hell is Lamar Wood?

759
00:37:56,186 --> 00:38:00,103
Some guy I knew in second grade.
I-I remember his...

760
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:03,933
...his brother, his dog,
his father.

761
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:08,590
I went over to his house
this one day.

762
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:13,987
What, were you guys
goin' steady?

763
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:19,122
No, it's just some guy I knew
in second grade. I was...

764
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,865
...maybe six, seven years old.

765
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:25,694
[stammers]
We had lunch.

766
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:30,177
Uh... We made hamburgers.
We didn't have any buns.

767
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,962
So, we used bread.

768
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,964
And, uh,

769
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,271
then-then he showed me
his dad's room,

770
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,970
and we listened to a ballgame
on the radio.

771
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,799
His dad had a fish tank.

772
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:46,236
And, uh, we fed the fish.

773
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,413
Yeah? What kind of fish?

774
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:51,416
Goldfish.

775
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:52,808
Oh, good.

776
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:56,334
You know, I remember a guy in,
uh, from school.

777
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,945
His name was, uh...

778
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,251
I don't remember his name,
but we called him "Crappy"

779
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,906
'cause he always shit his pants,
you know what I mean?

780
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,126
And he always used to
hold his piss in for, like,

781
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,649
fucking days at a time.

782
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:10,043
He used to punch his bladder
like that all the time.

783
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,740
I don't know why.

784
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,394
Just thought about it.

785
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,178
I wonder what it is.

786
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,746
The lump on your head
or the flashbacks?

787
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,011
Oh, the flashbacks...
the lumps on my neck.

788
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,231
The lump on your neck is cancer.

789
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,364
So, therefore,
you are going to die.

790
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,017
Flashbacks are jus that,

791
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:30,324
flashbacks of your
miserable life.

That's very nice.

793
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,504
I thought you'd like it.
Come on, let's get going.

794
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:38,114
So you think it's cancer?

795
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,160
Oh, always presume
something's cancer.

796
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,205
Anything less than that
is good news.

797
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,772

It's at a very special price.
- You can come in if you want,
instead of standing out there.

803
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:00,876
Okay, well,
thank you very much, ma'am.

By delaying, you're probably
gonna be disappointed.

812
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,338
We only have a limited edition
of this particular bible.

813
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:31,646
Our warehouses are fast
running out of stock.

814
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,869
Now, we're spec-- specializing
in this particular edition
at this time of year

815
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,741
because we know that,
within a year,

816
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:42,788
the value of this bible
will triple.

817
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,007
I'm not kidding you, ma'am,
it will triple.

818
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,270
Now, what do you think ma'am?

819
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:52,275
Would you, would you be
interested in, uh, buying
one of these today?

820
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,278
I-- I don't think so,
not right now.

821
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,543
Would, uh, later on,
say six o'clock be fine
with you, ma'am?

822
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,283
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

823
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,154
No, sir.

824
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,505
Okay, what time would be
more convenient for you?

825
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,289
Well, I have
no income right now,

826
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,423
so it would have to depend
on when I get income.

827
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,816
Oh, I see.

828
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:14,428
And another gook
bites the fuckin' dust.

829
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,864
Yeah, that's nice.

830
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,127
Yeah.

831
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,347
What'd you say the price was?

832
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:25,265
For your business today,

833
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:27,833
this is $500.

Go ahead, put that in your belt.

That's right, sir.

We believe in
a well-armed family,

00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,424

Looks like somebody
had a good day.

Nobody wants to talk,
nobody wants to buy.

847

Hey, Sidney, uh,
did you get those tickets?

Nope, sold out.

to see Neil play Vegas?

856
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,808
Neil never plays Vegas.

857
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:32,027
What if we hang around?
We can get some tickets.

858
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:33,942
Yeah, where's he playing?
At the Ce-- at Caesar's?

859
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:36,858
- Yup.
- Well, yeah,
there's gotta be scalpers.

860
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,599
Hey, Stan, you wanna go with me?

861
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,166
No, I...

862
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:42,951
I'm gonna stay in, I think
I caught some kind of disease

863
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:44,736
in that trailer park today.

864
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:46,476
Aww.

865
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,043
Sidney, what about you?

866
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:51,569
Mm... Yeah...
Yeah, okay, I'll come down.

867
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,223
Why not?
- Good! My kind of man.

868
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:55,877
Hey, Neil'll be proud
you showed up,

869
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:58,097
you know, one Jew to another.
[chuckles]

870
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,882
Hey, you know, all you kikes
should be like Neil.

871
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:04,277
You know, what a guy.
He's a talented guy.

872
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,540
He should be king
of the fucking Jews.

873
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,152
Christ, Phil, you still going on
about that Neil Diamond?

874
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:13,895
The guy sucks!
He died 20 years ago.

875
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,375
What'd you say?

876
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:18,987
You heard what I said.
Neil Diamond's all washed up.

877
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:21,903
Hell, if you wanna talk
singing Jews...

878
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:24,253
talk Billy Joel!

879
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:27,082
Billy'll kick Neil's ass!

880
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,823
Washed up?

881
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:32,871
Billy Joel kicks Neil's ass?

882
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,179
What'd you call him?
- Hey! Christ's sake!

883
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,313
[overlapping shouting]

884
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,756
It was August 24th, 1972
at the Greek!

885
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,758
I was a great person, man!

886
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:53,195
Did you ever listen
to "Sweet Caroline"?

887
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,544
Hey, cut it out!

888
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,808
[overlapping shouting]

889
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:58,723
Hey, hey, cut it out!

890
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,638
Apologize to Neil!

891
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,510
Apologize to Neil, man!

892
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:05,077
Take it easy!
Relax!

893
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,861
- Take it easy!
- Yeah, yeah.

894
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:09,342
Just cool it, man!
Okay?

895
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:11,997
[overlapping chatter]

896
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,563
Calm down.

897
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:14,869
Come on.

898
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,178
He's got this stuff...
you know, about Neil Diamond.

899
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:22,094
Neil got him through some
rough patches in Vietnam.

900
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:24,966
He takes it personal.
- Shit! No kidding!

901
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,056
Hey, Mike, I-I don't know
what happened, I-I'm sorry.

902
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,363
- That's okay, Phil.
- Hey, are you okay?

903
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:32,800
- I'm fine, just cool it.
- I feel so stupid.

904
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:34,846
Leave me alone, I'm fine.

905
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,326
Okay, look, guys, come on.

906
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:40,155
We need some fresh air.
Let's get a breath of fresh air.

907
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,766
Let's all go down to the pool.

908
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:43,158
We'll sit there,
we'll have a drink.

909
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:45,160
We relax. Okay?
- Yeah.

910
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:47,032
Okay, let's come down.
Okay?

911
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:49,121
- We'll go get some tickets?
- Yeah, come on.

912
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,124
[speaking Bosnian]

913
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:38,953
It, uh... looks like
my coat caught something.

914
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:41,173
I'll see you guys up there.

915
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:01,802
Hey, uh, excuse me, uh...

916
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:04,500
You girls, uh, fly for TWA?

917
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:05,719
No.

918
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:07,590
Who do you work for?

919
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:08,766
For Pan Am.

920
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,506
Oh, Pan American.

921
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,421
I used to know a girl
that used to work with Pan Am.

922
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:13,814
Um...

923
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:16,295
Uh, Pamela Roberts.
Do you know her?

924
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:17,339
No.

925
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,646
Uh, well,
she lived in Cincinnati.

926
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:21,300
I was just wonderin'.
- No.

927
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:23,432
So, um, where are you girls
headed to from here?

928
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:24,433
New York.

929
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:25,913
- Oh, New York, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

930
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:27,697
- The Big Apple, huh?
- Uh huh.

931
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:30,091
- Quite a life you girls lead.
- Uh huh.

932
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:31,919
And, uh, what do you do?

933
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:33,921
Oh, me, I'm, uh...

934
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,096
I'm in sales.

935
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,663
Um...

936
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:41,624
Real estate...
It's industrial real estate.

937
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:44,062
Warehouses, shopping malls,
that type of stuff.

938
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:45,803
It's all hush-hush now, though.

939
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:48,806
Well, Mr. American,
you want to buy me big house?

940
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:51,199
- Would I--
- Phil, you coming?

941
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,941
Uh, yeah, yeah, coming.
I gotta run.

942
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,682
- We're going.
- Okay, I'm coming.

943
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:57,466
Coming.
I gotta go.

944
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,469
Hey, maybe I'll see
y'all later.

945
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:03,037
You girls stayin'
at this hotel?
- Mm-hmm.

946
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:06,475
- Well, ta ta.
- Bye bye.

947
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,608
[speaking Bosnian]

948
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:18,618
[whispering]
So what's the story with Stan?

949
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,228
He thinks he's dying.

950
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:23,579
Has he seen a doctor?
Did he get a medical opinion?

951
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:27,409
He says why confirm
what he already knows.

952
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:29,890
Oh, shit.
Should I send him back?

953
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,631
No.
No, he'll be fine.

954
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:35,504
A couple days R and R is
just what the doctor ordered.

955
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,158
Is he sleeping?

956
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:38,246
No.

957
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,813
He lies awake the whole night

958
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,860
trying to piece together
his past.

959
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:44,209
He's what?

960
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,037
He tryin' to remember
his whole life.

961
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,301
Every day, every week,
every month,

962
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:53,131
from his very first memory
at the age of five.

963
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:54,828
That's impossible.

964
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,613
Not if one has a good memory.

965
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,180
Geez...

966
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:04,838
Right now he's
up to his early teens,

967
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,536
but he's starting
to run against some gaps.

968
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,103
It seems that, uh...

969
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:13,064
He thinks that they're
his good memories,

970
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,935
but he can't remember 'em.

971
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,937
It seems the bad parts
really flow.

972
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:18,678
It's really starting
to get to him.

973
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,201
Yeah.

974
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:21,899
I imagine so.

975
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:25,946
Hey, Bill,
I'm sorry about Mikey.

976
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,035
I don't know what happened.

977
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,255
Don't apologize, will ya?

978
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,344
Look, as far as I'm concerned,

979
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:34,868
you shoulda smacked him up
against the side of the head

980
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,957
and knocked some sense into him
for God's sakes.

981
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:38,350
I'm sorry.

982
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,222
So, um, what are you doin'
this Christmas?

983
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:45,748
Uh, we'll probably go
to Patti's mom's in Fresno.

984
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,533
That sounds exciting.

985
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,056
And you?

986
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,668
Oh, the wife wants
to come here to Vegas,

987
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:55,062
you know, with the kids.

988
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:56,281
Here?

989
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:57,891
Vegas?

990
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,024
Oh, Jesus.

991
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,898
Why do you complicate
your life?

992
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,901
I mean if you're gonna
find misery

993
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:12,601
in every miserable aspect
of your miserable existence,

994
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,995
at least rejoice in the misery.

995
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:16,954
Revel in the wretchedness.

996
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:19,608
You wanna know
the secret to life, Stan?

997
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:20,958
Huh?

998
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,873
You wake up in the morning,

999
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,701
you screw your wife,

1000
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:28,835
'cause you're gonna be
too pissed off later.

1001
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:31,620
Go to work, come home,

1002
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,710
watch some television,
and go to bed.

1003
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:38,976
Anything on top of that
is icing on the cake.

1004
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,978
Enjoy the pain.

1005
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,675
That's the secret.

1006
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:46,287
- Enjoy the pain?
- Mm-hmm.

1007
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:49,116
Yeah, between me and you,
Stan...

1008
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,380
...you need to get into
some serious masochism.

1009
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:53,599
Yeah.

1010
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,558
It'll change your life.

1011
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:59,170
There is no happier person
in this world

1012
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,998
than a true masochist.

1013
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,262
- You really think so?
- Mm.

1014
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:06,090
Think so?
I know so!

1015
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,005
You could throw that hot coffee
in my face,

1016
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:10,442
and I'd find a reason
to enjoy it.

1017
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:12,444
Hey, stick the ketchup bottle
up my ass,

1018
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:14,272
and I might even give you
a little dance.

1019
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:17,014
[scoffs]
You're so screwed up.

1020
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:24,021
Hey, check it out.

1021
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:25,457
Eyes at ten o'clock.

1022
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,546
What? Where? What?

1023
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,071
You don't recognize them?

1024
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:32,551
Who?

1025
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,161
The two girls.

1026
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,296
That's Holly Blonde
and Betsey Blue.

1027
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,124
Betsey Blue?

1028
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,474
Yeah, Betsey Blue,
the porn star.

1029
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,520
