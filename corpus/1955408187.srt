1
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,425
Okay, remember what we talked about?

2
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,686
Use the product rule
to find the derivative.

3
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:55,929
I can't do this.

4
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,157
Hey, Corinne, not now.

5
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:00,701
Yeah, you can, Simon.

6
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,569
I've seen your scratch work.

7
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:03,929
Just take your time.

8
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,798
Focus on the equation.

9
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,236
Okay, I can't learn this by tomorrow.

10
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,961
I'm totally fried.

11
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,709
Can't you just give 'em to me?

12
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:17,543
Simon.

13
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,268
Please.

14
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:35,202
Thanks.

15
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,763
You can't tell anyone about this.

16
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:41,133
As soon as the test
is over, destroy it.

17
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:46,447
You're lucky, that was my last one.

18
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:47,273
Don't you need it?

19
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,998
No.

20
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:50,951
Hello?

21
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,753
Laina, this is Dr. Perkash,

22
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:55,948
your mother is asking to be
discharged from the hospital.

23
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,090
What?

24
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:02,344
She's not so much asking as signing
herself out of care against our advice.

25
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:05,891
I'll be right there.

26
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,669
Just please try to stall her.

27
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,730
Okay, guys, time to go.

28
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,608
Hi, there they are.

29
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,553
This is perfect.

30
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,822
Can you take that to the car for mommy?

31
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:30,683
Mom, what are you doing?

32
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:32,552
I am checking out.

33
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:38,866
You know what, sweetheart, I
left your markers in my room.

34
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,594
Wanna go to mommy's room
and go get your markers?

35
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,937
Is mommy coming home?

36
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,662
Yes, I am.

37
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:52,338
Mom, you need to be here,
they can't treat you at home.

38
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,063
I know.

39
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:59,245
Laina, can I have a word?

40
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:03,616
Here, I know it's not all
of it, but I can get more.

41
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,894
Oh, um, no, we're past that.

42
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,297
Her white blood cell count
is not doing her any favors.

43
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:15,302
And this kind of aggressive depletion
doesn't give us a lot of options.

44
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:17,162
But she can't come home, right?

45
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,206
She's not gonna get any better there.

46
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:24,236
I think the best thing any one can do
now is to just keep her comfortable.

47
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,271
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,213
Can you help me carry my suitcase?

49
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,938
Uh huh.

50
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:46,300
Hey, I'm gonna make a run to
the kitchen, want anything?

51
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:47,693
No, I'm good Blake, thanks for asking.

52
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:48,302
You go ahead.

53
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:49,395
All right, thanks man.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
All right.

55
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,310
Oh my.

56
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,782
I honestly think I've done
that to you like 19 times.

57
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,818
Yeah, well, that's the last time..

58
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,426
I didn't mean it like that.

59
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,337
I just, I don't want to talk about it.

60
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:24,363
Ellie, no matter what happens, I'll...

61
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:28,367
I didn't come here
to talk about the test.

62
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,372
Come on, I wanna show you something.

63
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:36,473
Okay.

64
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,354
Sh! It's a secret.

65
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,079
Come on, Ellie.

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,691
Oh my god.

67
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,660
Ellie we shouldn't be doing this.

68
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:47,453
Calm down.

69
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,178
Live a little.

70
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:53,992
Ellie, did you bring your bathing suit?

71
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:56,128
No.

72
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,437
Go on.

73
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,923
What's wrong?

74
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,339
I'm scared, Blake.

75
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,967
Hey, we're in this together.

76
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:39,338
I'll take care of you.

77
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,684
Hey, Blake.

78
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:47,813
You know, I think I do want
something from the kitchen.

79
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,231
I found him at the Bilski's pool.

80
00:05:58,356 --> 00:05:59,956
Bilskis?

81
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:08,834
You want a Pop-Tart?

82
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,636
No thanks.

83
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,913
Some people like to toast these.

84
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,550
But I never have the
patience, you know.

85
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,275
Love 'em.

86
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,735
Did you have fun tonight?

87
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,396
You got anything going on tomorrow?

88
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,273
Oh wait, my god, you have a test.

89
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:41,567
It's test day tomorrow.

90
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,043
I completely forgot myself,

91
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,304
it's so easy to forget
something like that, isn't it?

92
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:46,480
I get it.

93
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,205
Hey, sorry.

94
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,946
Look, there's nothing wrong with having
a little fun every once in a while,

95
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,990
but you gotta pick your moments.

96
00:06:57,115 --> 00:07:01,620
The night before a life altering
test it's not the moment.

97
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,230
Got it.

98
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,464
Solid lecture.

99
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:05,365
Almost done.

100
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,962
Now, I know that you don't really
care what I think about this girl.

101
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,071
Ellie.

102
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,833
Ellie, but she's a distraction.

103
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:19,412
Now you have tomorrow, and next year.

104
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:24,109
And after that you have the whole
rest of your life to be distracted.

105
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,834
Don't eff it up.

106
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,413
You sure you don't want a Pop-Tart?

107
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,138
Good night, Dad.

108
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,583
Hey...come here.

109
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,346
No, no, no.

110
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,216
No!

111
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,926
Move along.

112
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:52,996
Shit!

113
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:20,934
Hey, Lana, right?

114
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,502
Yeah, Laina.

115
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:23,428
- Laina.
- It's cool.

116
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:24,604
Sorry, um.

117
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,099
This is kind of an awkward question.

118
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:31,303
I was hoping that I could
buy one of your study guides?

119
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:34,281
I can't.

120
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,117
What do you mean I can't.

121
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:40,245
I just gave the last one away.

122
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,970
Shit.

123
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,051
Hey Laina, wait up.

124
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:50,430
So, you and Blake Renning, huh?

125
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,098
No, not really.

126
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:53,458
He didn't even know my name.

127
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,302
He didn't know your name?

128
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,762
But we've been in school
with him since first grade

129
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,464
and there's less and
less kids each year.

130
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,274
I know, it's pretty tragic.

131
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,803
Geez, well, it's almost as tragic as
being in love with your best friend

132
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,072
who's in love with the guy that
doesn't even know her name.

133
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,516
But that's just something
I saw in a movie once.

134
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:10,442
Not today, Kellan.

135
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,512
Yeah, you're right, tomorrow's
actually better for me anyway.

136
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,083
No laptops, computer devices.

137
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,193
Hey, what the.

138
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,096
Get back here.

139
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,057
All units converse at the south gate.

140
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,191
We got a runner.

141
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:27,916
Get that kid.

142
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,829
Heading your way, now.

143
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:36,068
Whoa, I've never seen a kid
make it past the guards before.

144
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,344
Kellan.

145
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,304
Are you hacking into
your dad's account again?

146
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,029
Uh, yeah.

147
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,446
Bring him down.

148
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,747
You're surrounded.

149
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:50,156
Move in.

150
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,258
Come up now, on him.

151
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,493
Move in, boys.

152
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,154
So you're going to send the stolen
security footage to the news?

153
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,589
You ever heard of Wendy Banks?

154
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:58,665
No.

155
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,425
Well, she's a very prominent
news reporter in Austin

156
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,703
and I have her direct, personal,
general inquiries email address,

157
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:07,374
so I'm sending her hot
tips all the time.

158
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,009
Does she ever reply?

159
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,302
Whoa, I think I have
more than enough questions

160
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:13,505
to answer today, thank you, very much.

161
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:34,734
You're gonna be okay, okay?

162
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,695
You can do this, yeah?

163
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,253
Commence lock down sequence.

164
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,122
Yes sir.

165
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:14,299
Warning, lock down is now in progress.

166
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,502
30 seconds 'til lock down.

167
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:20,205
Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

168
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,916
Good morning, everyone.

169
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,685
I hope you all had a good night sleep.

170
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,621
I just want you to know

171
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:40,192
that you've all had a great year,
and despite what happens today,

172
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,395
I am proud of each
and every one of you.

173
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:50,477
These questions are tough, but
they are not aimed to trick you.

174
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,804
So, focus, take your time.

175
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,277
And no matter how hard something looks,

176
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,280
there's always a chance.

177
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,282
You'll have two hours
to complete the test.

178
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,658
No talking.

179
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,852
Keep your eyes on your own tablet.

180
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:13,258
This time is an accurate test that
will determine your aptitude.

181
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:16,328
As you know, all grades are final.

182
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:19,231
Pick up your tablets and begin.

183
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:16,888
You have one minute remaining.

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,337
Time's up, tablets down, test is over.

185
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,935
Okay, here are the results.

186
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,178
Donald Green.

187
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,994
Come with me.

188
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,719
Kellie Jeffries.

189
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,532
This way.

190
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,257
Marcus Langley.

191
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,304
Don't touch me.

192
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,464
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

193
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,132
- Hands out.
- Touch me.

194
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:35,567
Lane Vic.

195
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:38,011
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

196
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,004
He's on the move, he's on the move.

197
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,107
Hey, get him, back row.

198
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,409
Give him the door.

199
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,051
Carrie Billich.

200
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,058
Come on, it's time to go.

201
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,594
Please stop, please.

202
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,729
And finally.

203
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,767
Peter Strand.

204
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,540
Ellie Harper.

205
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,211
No, no!

206
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:30,455
Congratulations, you've all passed.

207
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:35,635
You can go to the rec room now.

208
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,162
Governor, Blake's on the phone.

209
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,871
Oh, good.

210
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,733
Blake, I just heard the
good news, congratulations.

211
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:45,904
Dad, they took Ellie, she's
going to the thinning.

212
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:47,629
Oh god.

213
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:49,849
I'm sorry son.

214
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:51,109
We have to do something, Dad.

215
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,353
Just make a phone call, you
can say it was a mistake.

216
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:54,646
You know I can't do that.

217
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,788
Dad.

218
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:57,182
Son, we all have to obey the law.

219
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,559
No matter how painful it is.

220
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:03,730
I can't lose her, Dad, I love her.

221
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,890
I'm sorry, son, my hands are tied.

222
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,996
Stay in the line.

223
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,873
Keep going.

224
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:16,376
Single file.

225
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,101
You, this way.

226
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,016
What are you doing?

227
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:33,393
Get back in line.

228
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,161
Put that down.

229
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:41,000
Run, Ellie!

230
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,725
Go, now!

231
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:46,865
She went down the hall.

232
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,502
Help, help, no, no, no, please, no!

233
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:52,227
No!

234
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:55,607
There's nothing to see.

235
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:56,449
No!

236
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,243
Come on, hurry up, this way.

237
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,968
No, no, no!

238
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,189
Let her go!

239
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,091
Let her go!

240
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:06,751
No, let her go!

241
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,494
Blake!

242
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,489
Ellie! Ellie! Ellie!

243
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,142
Hey Wade, come on in, boy.

244
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:11,557
Mr. Glass?

245
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,585
Do you have a minute?

246
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,203
Corinne, watch your brother.

247
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,784
Hi.

248
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,345
I know you told me to stop,

249
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,648
but I made way too much of
this casserole, so please.

250
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:44,983
Joey, turn it off.

251
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,618
Corinne has to study.

252
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:49,595
I'm sorry, thank you so much.

253
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,656
Listen, do you have someone
to watch Joey tomorrow?

254
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,633
Because I know of a great day care.

255
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,868
The Consores said they'd
watch him, thank you.

256
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:57,362
I know it's Corinne's first test.

257
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,664
We're going to be fine.

258
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:04,235
You know I'm here if you need me.

259
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,706
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

260
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,409
So, as far as tomorrow?

261
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:48,213
I wouldn't worry about a thing.

262
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:25,817
If you're watching this video,
then I am no longer alive.

263
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:32,090
How many sides does a pentagon have?

264
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,299
Five.

265
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:34,358
What causes disease?

266
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:36,335
Bacteria.

267
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,395
How many letters are in the alphabet?

268
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,120
26.

269
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,334
Who loves you?

270
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:46,979
You do.

271
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:48,940
You're going to do great.

272
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:50,408
I love you so much.

273
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,443
I love you, too.

274
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:00,159
Hey, you ready to go?

275
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,884
Uh huh.

276
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:06,699
Name, please?

277
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,126
Corinne Michaels.

278
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,703
Okay, thanks.

279
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,428
Good luck, Corinne.

280
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,834
Name, please?

281
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,717
You have a sit down with
Greet the Press at 1pm

282
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:25,877
directly after the announcement.

283
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:26,919
Great, what about the speech?

284
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,513
We got the revisions this
morning, they're good.

285
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,514
Did Georgina sign off?

286
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,923
Yes, sir.

287
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:34,319
You're car will be ready for you at 11.

288
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,333
Hey, knock knock.

289
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,102
What do you want, I'm running late.

290
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:44,996
Not everything I do
has a grand intention.

291
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:47,098
I just wanted to say hey.

292
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,433
Hey.

293
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,247
Blake.

294
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,809
I wish there was something
I could have done.

295
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:00,211
But none of us are above the law.

296
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,547
Not me, not you, not Ellie.

297
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,957
That's a good line.

298
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:08,353
You should use it in your speech today.

299
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:13,792
Is there anything else
you want to try out?

300
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:34,278
Hey.

301
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:36,489
Hey.

302
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:39,792
I can't believe this is the last one.

303
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,619
I don't know why I'm telling you this
right now but I'm sweating so much

304
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:43,796
that my backpack is just wet.

305
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,364
That's gross.

306
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,624
I know you don't stress
out about this stuff

307
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:51,504
because you're a genius or whatever,
but, you gotta be a little bit relieved.

308
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,506
I mean, think about it,
this is the last time

309
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,199
you have to worry about grades forever.

310
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:56,924
Not exactly.

311
00:23:58,035 --> 00:24:00,479
You know you don't have to
hang out with me, it's okay.

312
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,240
Oh, really, sweet.

313
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,319
Did I get you?

314
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:09,113
No, you do this everyday.

315
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:12,358
Oh, well, do I do this everyday?

316
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:14,560
'Ello, do I look British?

317
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,285
Do I look like a British person?

318
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:19,899
Out of the way, bitches.

319
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:23,862
Wade Freeman, all star
quarterback, represent!

320
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:28,374
How the hell is that guy still here?

321
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:29,441
Maybe he's smart.

322
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:30,601
Is this your phone?

323
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:31,435
Here you go.

324
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,813
Oh, dude, oh here you go, I'm sorry.

325
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,273
Aw man, you're definitely
getting thinned.

326
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,082
Go fetch, bitch.

327
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:38,807
Closeted smart.

328
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:47,652
- Commence lock down sequence,
- Yes sir.

329
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:53,557
Warning, lock down is now in progress.

330
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:56,569
30 seconds until lock down.

331
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:59,464
Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

332
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:05,169
Warning, lock down is now in progress.

333
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,984
Excuse me, Governor Redding?

334
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:13,945
Increased security
demonstrations in Moscow.

335
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,147
Sir, I think you're gonna
want to take a look at this.

336
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:17,872
It's your son.

337
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:31,629
Good morning, class.

338
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:34,006
Good morning, Miss Cole.

339
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,667
Now, before we begin, I'm going to
show you a really special video

340
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:40,038
before you take your first test, okay?

341
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:48,713
This is planet Earth, our home.

342
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,648
See how happy she is?

343
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,186
Well, she wasn't always so happy.

344
00:25:55,311 --> 00:26:00,191
You see, not so long ago, the
Earth wasn't feeling so well.

345
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,728
First, she got too hot.

346
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,732
Then, the oceans started to rise,

347
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,644
leaving less room on the
land for Earth's friends,

348
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,080
and with less land and
more and more people,

349
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:17,742
there was just not enough
room for everybody.

350
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,953
Luckily, boys and girls
from all over the world

351
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:24,382
got together and came up
with some very cool ways

352
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:28,586
to eliminate five percent of
their population annually.

353
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,228
You okay, Miss Cole?

354
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,565
Everything all right?

355
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:45,803
Because if you are not up for it, we
can have someone else come down here.

356
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:48,047
No, I'm fine.

357
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:49,774
Just need a minute.

358
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:04,789
Some places
say goodbye to their oldest.

359
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,400
Others only let mommies
and daddies have one baby.

360
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:13,973
In America, what if only the smartest
boys and girls got to live here?

361
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:17,009
That way, there's enough to go around.

362
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:20,412
And America could be
the best country again.

363
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:21,647
Isn't that neat?

364
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,717
Now, all kids from 1st
grade til 12th grade

365
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:29,047
get to take the 10-241 test to
help planet Earth feel great.

366
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,765
'Kay, now, it's time for everyone
to pick up your tablets, okay?

367
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,662
You have a very exciting test
today, just like we practiced.

368
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:52,111
These questions are hard, but
if you take your time, and focus,

369
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:55,139
remember there's always a chance.

370
00:27:57,174 --> 00:28:00,111
Okay, pick up your tablets and begin.

371
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:03,245
Good luck.

372
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:10,329
If you're watching this video,
then I am no longer alive.

373
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,756
Today, I will be filling
in enough incorrect answers

374
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:15,768
to definitely fail my 10-241 examine.

375
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:18,771
My dad wants to stand by this system.

376
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:23,234
He's gonna have to stand by a system
that put his own son to death.

377
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:29,548
I want him home now.

378
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:31,509
- Sir, we can't...
- I want my son home now!

379
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,878
Testing's already begun, the
school's on complete lock down.

380
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,779
God damnit, god damnit!

381
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,391
Sir, they're ready for you.

382
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,494
Take a walk.

383
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,726
This is Mason King.

384
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:48,352
Yes, Nathan.

385
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:49,987
I don't know this one.

386
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:51,712
Can you help me?

387
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:01,340
Sorry, I can't.

388
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,867
Just do your best, okay?

389
00:30:03,992 --> 00:30:05,878
Okay.

390
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:28,349
Time's up, tablets down, test is over.

391
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:49,947
If I call your name, I want you
to stand up and follow the leader.

392
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:53,985
We're gonna play a song
while we grade the test.

393
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:16,448
Nicole Chung.

394
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:20,701
No, no!

395
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:25,783
Get off me.

396
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,271
Mark Salazar.

397
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:52,910
Come with me.

398
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:58,557
Sarah Foster.

399
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,926
No, no, no!

400
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,454
No, no, please no, don't, no!

401
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,361
Congratulations, the
rest of you passed.

402
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,729
And lastly.

403
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:22,537
Laina Michaels.

404
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,010
What?

405
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:33,507
Come on, it's time to go.

406
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,220
Class dismissed.

407
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,435
Is he safe?

408
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,628
The transfer is complete.

409
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,738
Everything is in order, governor.

410
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,974
Mason, I appreciate your discretion.

411
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,743
As always, I need the word
from you to make it official.

412
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:52,936
Are we approved to
commence the thinning.

413
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:53,771
You are approved.

414
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:55,740
Yes, sir.

415
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,707
Good.

416
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,045
Good, are you ready?

417
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,947
Time to sell the dream.

418
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:32,951
Officer, wait, I'm Kendra
Birch, I'm Laina's teacher.

419
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,120
Laina's the best student I've ever had.

420
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:38,682
I'm finding it very difficult to
believe that she failed the exam.

421
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:41,652
Maybe there was a
problem with her tablet?

422
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,829
Do something, please?

423
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:46,398
Make it right.

424
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:50,068
Chang, there's a
teacher in the west corridor

425
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:51,962
who thinks there's a mistake
with a student's test.

426
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:54,139
Please advise.

427
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:55,499
What's the name of the student?

428
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:57,109
Michaels, Laina Michaels.

429
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,936
Look up, Michaels.

430
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,661
First name, Laina.

431
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:05,476
There's no mistake, proceed, and
don't hold up the line again.

432
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,201
No, I can't.

433
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,823
There's always a chance.

434
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:14,018
Get the hell out of here.

435
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:19,723
Let's go, move out.

436
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:40,652
Hey, congratulations, you made it!

437
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,487
Frank Halloran, EG Electric.

438
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:44,681
Aren't you Governor Redding's son?

439
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:48,219
I'd like to talk to
you about your future.

440
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,487
Hey, Clare!

441
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:00,795
Come on.

442
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,177
Thata boy.

443
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:06,902
Thata boy, Kellan.

444
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,006
When my grandfather
started at Server Global,

445
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:45,484
he only worked with
people he could trust.

446
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:49,646
And I can tell you, today, that he
would trust no one more than my friend

447
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:55,352
and the leader of the great state
of Texas, Governor Dean Redding!

448
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:56,620
Thank you, Georgina.

449
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:58,345
Thank you.

450
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,859
Thank you, thank you.

451
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,828
What a great day in Texas!

452
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:13,545
Being governor of this great
state for the past six years,

453
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,773
we've accomplished some
pretty incredible things.

454
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,283
We balanced the budget.

455
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:20,377
We even had a little bit
of change left to spare.

456
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:30,887
We cracked down on crime by 26%, and
above all, we are number one in education

457
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:33,624
in the entire United States of America.

458
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,302
Move down the line.

459
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,674
Move down the line.

460
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:56,221
Our world is crowded.

461
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:58,690
We had to look facts square in the eye.

462
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:00,892
- You must be really proud.
- And make some hard decisions.

463
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:05,389
We had to collectively decide, what
kind of world do we want to live in?

464
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:10,094
25 years ago, America was in trouble.

465
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:30,014
Prepare for decontamination.

466
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:33,017
Remove all clothing.

467
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:56,715
There are those that say
the thinning is barbaric.

468
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,978
Well, I ask you, is it barbaric
to be leading in innovation?

469
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:12,923
Is it barbaric to be the number one
most informed and educated population

470
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:14,648
in 196 countries?

471
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:19,496
Is it barbaric to be the best?

472
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:28,380
If you don't work, if you don't
support our great society,

473
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:31,241
then you are living off the system.

474
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:32,966
That is a parasite.

475
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,813
And do you know what
we do with parasites?

476
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:38,849
We wash them out.

477
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,124
Today's average student

478
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,368
is yesterday's valedictorian.

479
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:51,495
Tell that to Vermont.

480
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,220
Tell that to Oregon.

481
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:58,710
We introduced competition
in the classroom

482
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:01,371
and the results speak for themselves.

483
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,010
Put these on now.

484
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:12,223
Our great country has many
challenges still ahead.

485
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:13,948
And with your help,

486
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:17,888
we can take the good
things we've done in Texas

487
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:21,525
and lead the rest of America
into an even greater tomorrow.

488
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:31,769
Sir, please, help me.

489
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,938
You know, you
shouldn't be in the hallway.

490
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:51,546
This hour, this minute,

491
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:54,959
this moment.

492
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:11,301
I have looked inside myself

493
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:16,907
and in front of the people
of the great state of Texas.

494
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:29,561
No, no!

495
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:32,255
I came here to declare my candidacy

496
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,692
for president of the
United States of America.

497
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,066
Stay in your seat.

498
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:09,225
Hey, back to the chair.

499
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,869
Remain seated.

500
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:12,262
Sit down!

501
00:42:12,387 --> 00:42:13,997
No!

502
00:42:14,122 --> 00:42:16,241
Get down!

503
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,634
Hey you, sit down!

504
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:19,544
Now!

505
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:21,271
Get them in control!

506
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:40,757
System is down,
commence containment mode.

507
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:43,093
Send Victor Woods directly
to the control room.

508
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:45,328
We need a full patch of
the electrical system.

509
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:48,172
Copy that.

510
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:05,423
Victor Woods,
report to the control room.

511
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:07,617
Everybody stand back, stand back.

512
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:09,627
Uh, Victor Woods, thanks.

513
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:11,254
We've had a minor power outage.

514
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:14,024
Nobody leave this room
until further notice.

515
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:23,374
What are they doing out of the chairs?

516
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:25,769
Some of the restraints shorted
during the power outage.

517
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,737
But we got it under control.

518
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,647
Have you done a head count?

519
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:31,274
Sir, the door's locked.

520
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:34,077
There's no way they could have.

521
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:36,721
This isn't a discussion.

522
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:38,348
When's the power back?

523
00:43:38,473 --> 00:43:40,150
Power's about 30 away.

524
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:43,995
The cameras are gonna
need a separate patch.

525
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,720
Just get it done.

526
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:56,307
Hey!

527
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:58,743
What are you doing down here?

528
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:00,244
It's about time.

529
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,738
I called for you 10 minutes ago.

530
00:44:01,863 --> 00:44:02,739
What?

531
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:03,648
I'm Miss Birch.

532
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:04,616
I teach 10th to 12th grade.

533
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:05,675
Wait, why are you wearing...

534
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,710
I just saw a student
go down that stairwell.

535
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,771
What's the count?

536
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:38,049
There's one unaccounted for.

537
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:39,684
You lost a student.

538
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:41,277
I don't know how she got out.

539
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:42,687
She?

540
00:44:42,812 --> 00:44:46,457
Her name is Laina Michaels.

541
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:48,182
And where is she?

542
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,798
Blake?

543
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:55,299
Lauren?

544
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:57,535
You failed the test?

545
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,704
It's Laina, and no.

546
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:02,340
There's no way I failed that test.

547
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:03,867
What are you doing here?

548
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,543
Didn't you pass?

549
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:07,170
I failed the test on purpose.

550
00:45:07,295 --> 00:45:08,813
You did what?

551
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:12,609
I put my dad between a rock and a
hard place and he moved the rock.

552
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:15,612
Something's not right.

553
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:18,815
Come on, I think I know where to go.

554
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:32,129
Level four breach, level four breach.

555
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,807
Level four breach.

556
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:39,410
- Come on.
- Level four breach.

557
00:45:39,535 --> 00:45:41,204
Level four breach.

558
00:45:42,238 --> 00:45:43,273
Hey, hey, come on.

559
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:44,382
Stay back.

560
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:45,583
Hey, what the hell's going on?

561
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:46,809
Everybody stay where you are.

562
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:49,720
This will all be over soon.

563
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:52,757
Sir, it's past noon.

564
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:55,585
We're still in lock
down until this is done.

565
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,395
No one comes in or out.

566
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,423
Parents are already asking
when they'll see their children.

567
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:03,134
What's the status on
the missing student?

568
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:04,627
All clear on level four.

569
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:09,540
I want every teacher brought
to holding room A immediately.

570
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:11,568
Yes, sir.

571
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,720
Okay.

572
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:24,848
Where do you want to go?

573
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:28,860
We need to find where
they keep the tests.

574
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:29,953
What are you gonna do?

575
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,322
Steal the answers for next year?

576
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,731
Excuse me?

577
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:36,259
You know, for your
little side business.

578
00:46:36,384 --> 00:46:40,463
Where you sell the answers
to desperate kids for money.

579
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:44,734
You don't know what
you're talking about.

580
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:46,511
No, I do.

581
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:49,973
Innocent kids are killed
to meet a bottom line.

582
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,443
And you found a way to profit off them.

583
00:46:55,278 --> 00:47:00,016
Tell me, Laina, what did you
spend the money on first?

584
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:02,193
Was it a car?

585
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:03,987
A nice dress, maybe?

586
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:07,889
My mom.

587
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:14,030
We had to figure out a way
to pay for the treatments.

588
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:19,502
We sold everything we could,
but, it still wasn't enough.

589
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:23,881
I'm not proud of what I did.

590
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:26,910
I just didn't know what else to do.

591
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:31,348
In the end it didn't even matter.

592
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:38,955
You know, it's funny, every day in school
they teach us how to solve problems.

593
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,993
But none of those answers
are on the real world.

594
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:46,296
I'm such a dick.

595
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,639
I'm sorry.

596
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:49,774
It's okay.

597
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:53,270
Thank you for admitting you're a dick.

598
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,981
I'm sorry, too.

599
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:02,879
I just always liked you and I guess
I was kind of jealous of Ellie.

600
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:04,755
You like me?

601
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,549
Liked, past tense.

602
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:11,655
Now, can you help me?

603
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,499
Um, yeah, I can get
us to the control room

604
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:17,794
but with the power out
there's not much we can do.

605
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,519
Right.

606
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,302
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

607
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:32,675
We can follow the network cables,
which will lead to the server room

608
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,318
which runs on reserve power.

609
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:35,678
Yeah, but don't all computers require

610
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,581
- administrator access...
- Access card?

611
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:40,306
Come on.

612
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:44,762
Yeah, we're doing it.

613
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:47,090
I'm great, I'm glad we could
finally get this on the calendar.

614
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,399
As am I.

615
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:51,428
10 seconds, 10 seconds.

616
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,868
Got it, thank you.

617
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:15,952
Key cards and I.D.s

618
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,703
Thank you for joining us, governor.

619
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:28,431
Thank you for having me here,
Vince, it's a pleasure to be here.

620
00:49:28,556 --> 00:49:29,899
Governor, I apologize.

621
00:49:30,024 --> 00:49:32,343
We're getting breaking news right now.

622
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:36,981
There is a story developing at Vista
Point High School, right here in Austin.

623
00:49:37,106 --> 00:49:40,610
We're getting word that the
school is still under lock down.

624
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:43,087
Now, the test should
have ended hours ago.

625
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:44,413
Parents are growing concerned

626
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:48,092
as the school is said to be
holding students indefinitely

627
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:51,587
with no word as to whether or
not their children are safe.

628
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:56,734
Now, governor, what do say
to these concerned voters?

629
00:49:56,859 --> 00:50:02,421
Well, while, I don't have any
immediate details on the incident,

630
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:08,079
I can say that we do have the
best team in the nation on site

631
00:50:08,204 --> 00:50:12,550
and that any problems or confusion
will be resolved shortly.

632
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:16,846
Somebody tell me what the hell
is going on at that school.

633
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:20,750
It's worse than we thought.

634
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,093
Show me.

635
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:23,286
Parents have been
waiting for over two hours

636
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:26,055
with little to no information
on what has happened

637
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,466
to their children at Vista Point High.

638
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:32,570
We don't know if our son passed
the test or failed or anything.

639
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:36,140
This day is hard enough for all
of us and we deserve answers.

640
00:50:36,265 --> 00:50:38,042
This community has been through enough.

641
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:41,779
No parents of students at Vista
Point have been notified as of yet.

642
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:44,207
We'll keep you updated
as this bizarre story.

643
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,976
Get King on the emergency line.

644
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:58,252
Key card and I.D.

645
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,495
This is Mason King.

646
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:58,214
I'm about to have a thousand
royally pissed off parents

647
00:51:58,339 --> 00:52:01,192
talking to news vans in front
of a school with no power.

648
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:03,861
I need you to explain to me how
this is even remotely handled.

649
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:05,187
The cables are nearly patched through.

650
00:52:05,312 --> 00:52:06,730
We'll have power back shortly.

651
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:10,192
As soon as the power is on, the
thinning continues, you understand?

652
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:11,769
The eyes of the nation are on us.

653
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:13,329
We have zero room for failure.

654
00:52:13,454 --> 00:52:15,031
Understood, sir.

655
00:52:15,156 --> 00:52:16,507
We'll find her.

656
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:17,600
We'll find her.

657
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,325
Find who?

658
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:23,839
Blake!

659
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:25,564
Blake!

660
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,957
Blake, breathe.

661
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:34,682
Blake, breathe!

662
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:57,281
So that happened.

663
00:52:57,406 --> 00:52:59,006
Go put these on.

664
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:09,619
So, am I going to have to ask you
or are you going to be a gentleman?

665
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,689
I'll be a gentleman.

666
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:30,106
Do I need to ask you to be a lady?

667
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:31,715
Sorry.

668
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,042
It's all good.

669
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:36,913
I got like a three quick
peeks, so we're even.

670
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:40,724
Okay, are you decent?

671
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:44,020
No, but I am wearing clothes.

672
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:53,696
So I guess we're gonna have to figure out
a way to get back up there, somehow.

673
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,301
You do that, I'm going
to go through here.

674
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:03,314
What the hell is this?

675
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,408
We passed the test, this is bullshit.

676
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,318
I want to go home.

677
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:08,944
No one has told us anything.

678
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:11,322
Are we just supposed to
sit here, indefinitely?

679
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:13,849
Nobody leaves this room
until we get the all clear.

680
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,451
Don't tell me what to do.

681
00:54:15,576 --> 00:54:17,687
Do you have any idea
who my parents are?

682
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:18,596
I'm leaving.

683
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:20,321
Stay back!

684
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:01,829
Shit.

685
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:32,995
We can't go down there.

686
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,464
There's too many of them.

687
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:37,441
We need that card.

688
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,502
I don't think we can get
to the computer without it.

689
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,406
Okay, well, there's
got to be another way.

690
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:47,810
Where are you going?

691
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:03,559
This is the one.

692
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:04,927
All right.

693
00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:06,652
You ready?

694
00:56:58,347 --> 00:56:59,947
Perfect.

695
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:15,239
Blake, hurry.

696
00:57:16,323 --> 00:57:17,923
Go, go, go.

697
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:18,528
Blake?

698
00:59:18,653 --> 00:59:19,755
You take care of that.

699
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,991
I'm going to the thinning.

700
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:36,246
Okay, the major networks
should be here within the hour.

701
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:37,639
I still don't understand
what you'll say.

702
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:38,916
The press are like sharks, Ted.

703
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,342
They smell blood,
they'll come swimming.

704
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:44,546
We just need to give
them some fresh meat.

705
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:50,085
We found him beat up pretty bad.

706
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,554
You got beat up by a girl.

707
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:54,757
No, sir, well, yes sir.

708
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,482
It was two of them.

709
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:01,505
Two girls?

710
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,173
No, it was a male student.

711
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:04,466
They got the jump on me.

712
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:07,136
The other said she was a teacher.

713
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:11,107
What was the teacher's name?

714
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,152
This is ridiculous.

715
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:27,023
Yes, this whole thing is.

716
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:33,503
I don't know about you, but I
could use a drink after this.

717
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:35,228
Me too.

718
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:39,568
You want to join me for one later?

719
01:00:40,702 --> 01:00:42,112
Sure.

720
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:43,714
Good.

721
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,775
I have to warn you,

722
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,545
I get a little handsy when I drink.

723
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:53,716
I can deal with handsy.

724
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,187
So I'll see you after school?

725
01:00:58,312 --> 01:00:59,822
I'll see you then.

726
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,547
'Kay.

727
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:55,776
Shit.

728
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:03,827
Kellan.

729
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:17,164
Come on.

730
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:23,172
Miss Birch, right?

731
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:26,542
Let's continue where we left off.

732
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,267
Key card and I.D.

733
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:40,554
Very well.

734
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:47,194
Key card and I.D.

735
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,811
I must have dropped it.

736
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:56,872
No, I don't think so.

737
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,474
Excuse me, this is a mistake.

738
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,199
Everybody out.

739
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:09,618
I had it two seconds ago.

740
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:12,788
Where is she?

741
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:14,513
Who?

742
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,860
I don't know who you're talking about.

743
01:03:23,123 --> 01:03:24,341
I'm broke.

744
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:26,066
This is the last time
that I'll ask nicely.

745
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:28,727
Where's Laina?

746
01:03:54,296 --> 01:03:55,896
Oh my god, Laina.

747
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:30,826
All the information we have as of now
is this morning, approximately 11:45am,

748
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:36,062
Laina Michaels, a student at Vista
Point High, failed an exam.

749
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:39,634
She then proceeded to
attack several DPC officers,

750
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:43,580
injuring two and tragically
killing two others.

751
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:45,374
Since then, the
students have been moved

752
01:05:45,499 --> 01:05:49,578
to a safe place and are being protected
under the watchful eye of our teachers

753
01:05:49,703 --> 01:05:52,622
until Miss Michaels can be apprehended.

754
01:05:52,747 --> 01:05:54,383
Corinne, do you need a ride home?

755
01:05:54,508 --> 01:05:58,520
I would like
to speak to you as a father.

756
01:05:58,645 --> 01:05:59,429
Come on.

757
01:05:59,554 --> 01:06:01,564
I understand your pain.

758
01:06:01,689 --> 01:06:03,833
My son is in that school as well.

759
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:08,697
And I will do everything in my power to
bring him and everyone else home safe.

760
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:12,034
Blake, if you're watching,

761
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:15,468
I love you son.

762
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,850
This is a trying time for all of us.

763
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:24,587
I ask for your patience and understanding
as we move to resolve this matter

764
01:06:24,712 --> 01:06:26,148
and bring Miss Michaels to justice.

765
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,684
Wendy, you need to see this.

766
01:06:31,653 --> 01:06:33,455
This was taken from
inside the high school.

767
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,892
Yeah, that's definitely a DPC
guard hitting a passing student.

768
01:06:37,017 --> 01:06:38,593
This doesn't add up.

769
01:06:38,718 --> 01:06:40,996
Who's the source on this?

770
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:55,385
This footage was sent to us by a student
source inside Vista Point High.

771
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,110
Kellan?

772
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:20,877
Hello.

773
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:22,637
All units converge to the server room.

774
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:24,362
We have her.

775
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:46,903
Attention.

776
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:51,007
I was just told to move these students
to the recreation hall immediately.

777
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:52,868
I didn't hear that.

778
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:57,747
The students are staying until
Mason King says otherwise.

779
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:02,185
I was just told to take everyone to the
recreation hall without any hold ups.

780
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,578
So, let's get moving.

781
01:08:03,703 --> 01:08:05,303
Undo the restraints.

782
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:11,253
No, we do don't do anything without
direct confirmation from Mason King.

783
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,155
Identify yourself now.

784
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:15,198
Of course.

785
01:08:15,323 --> 01:08:17,125
I'm sorry, let me show
you the confirmation.

786
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,160
He's not a guard!

787
01:08:38,713 --> 01:08:40,223
I have proof.

788
01:08:40,348 --> 01:08:41,750
I passed that test.

789
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:43,952
Congratulations.

790
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:55,264
Take her to the thinning.

791
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,959
Holy shit.

792
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:39,874
Good, get him down.

793
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:41,985
Get his mask.

794
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:49,259
I don't care where you pull the
graphics from, we're going live now.

795
01:09:49,384 --> 01:09:51,294
Wendy, this hasn't been
approved by the network.

796
01:09:51,419 --> 01:09:52,621
Karl, it's called
breaking news for a reason.

797
01:09:52,746 --> 01:09:54,890
We're going with this, now.

798
01:09:57,692 --> 01:09:59,802
Three, two.

799
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:19,948
No, no, not Laina.

800
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:27,389
Less than an hour ago, Governor
Redding announced a situation

801
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:32,260
inside Vista Point High involving a
dangerous failed student, Laina Michaels,

802
01:10:32,385 --> 01:10:37,699
said to be wreaking havoc on campus
leaving behind her a trail of terror.

803
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,746
Just moments ago, we received
official documentation

804
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:56,326
from inside the high school
revealing falsified test scores,

805
01:10:56,451 --> 01:11:02,224
possibly to favor or target specific
students to evade or endure the thinning.

806
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:06,235
Among those wrongfully
accused of failing the exam,

807
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,872
Laina Michaels, received one of
the highest scores in the school.

808
01:11:09,997 --> 01:11:12,342
Blake Redding, son of
governor Dean Redding

809
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:17,272
passed the exam, despite having the
lowest score at Vista Point High.

810
01:11:22,076 --> 01:11:23,186
Hi.

811
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:25,221
I thought you said that you had
the situation under control.

812
01:11:25,346 --> 01:11:26,047
Well, the situation's changing.

813
01:11:26,172 --> 01:11:27,223
Yes it has.

814
01:11:27,348 --> 01:11:29,217
I'm starting to think I
backed the wrong horse.

815
01:11:29,342 --> 01:11:32,187
Congressman Sandoval doesn't come
with these kinds of problems.

816
01:11:32,312 --> 01:11:33,096
Georgina.

817
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:34,330
Don't Georgina me.

818
01:11:34,455 --> 01:11:36,966
Fix it or you won't have enough
money to run for city comptroller.

819
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,761
This explosive
development calls everything

820
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:42,731
said today by the governor's
office into question

821
01:11:42,856 --> 01:11:45,834
and reveals a larger scandal at play.

822
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:51,180
This is bad.

823
01:11:51,305 --> 01:11:52,215
This is bad.

824
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,342
You got to shut it down.

825
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,914
Dean, it's over, you
got to let the girl go.

826
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:01,750
You need to shut this down, right now.

827
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,886
Goddammit, Dean, are
you listening to me?

828
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:06,996
It's over.

829
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:08,957
There's no more moves.

830
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:14,437
There's one more move.

831
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,873
No, please.

832
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:18,598
No, no!

833
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:28,510
Sir, everything is in order.

834
01:12:29,911 --> 01:12:33,749
As always, I need the word
from you to make it official.

835
01:12:34,982 --> 01:12:38,386
Are we approved to
commence the thinning?

836
01:12:41,055 --> 01:12:45,193
Sir, are we approved to
commence the thinning?

837
01:12:45,318 --> 01:12:46,918
No.

838
01:12:48,963 --> 01:12:50,799
There's been a change.

839
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,868
We need to revise the list.

840
01:12:53,993 --> 01:12:54,944
Sir?

841
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:57,506
That's an order.

842
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:23,565
All released students are free
to proceed to the recreation hall.

843
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:27,035
Congratulations, you've passed.

844
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:43,583
Round them up.

845
01:13:47,922 --> 01:13:48,890
What's going on?

846
01:13:49,015 --> 01:13:49,891
Let's go.

847
01:13:50,016 --> 01:13:50,800
Blake.

848
01:13:50,925 --> 01:13:51,893
Blake what's happening?

849
01:13:52,018 --> 01:13:52,802
It's okay.

850
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:53,803
No, what's going on?

851
01:13:53,928 --> 01:13:54,596
It's okay, I did this.

852
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,597
Get her out of here.

853
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:56,506
Blake, no!

854
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:57,599
Get her out of here!

855
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,243
Put me down, no!

856
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:01,369
Out of the way.

857
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:03,379
Wade Freeman, time to go.

858
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:04,547
Get off me, bro.

859
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,407
Bro, that's my throwing arm, bro.

860
01:14:06,532 --> 01:14:08,042
Do you know who I am?

861
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:10,478
Wade Freeman, you bitch.

862
01:15:55,016 --> 01:15:55,826
It's all over.

863
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,927
The school-wide lock
down has been lifted

864
01:15:58,052 --> 01:15:59,721
and passing students have been reunited

865
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:05,026
with their loved ones after what has
been a long, trying day, here in Austin.

866
01:16:17,438 --> 01:16:20,742
As always, our hearts go out to the
families of the failing students

867
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:23,419
who scored in the lowest percentile.

868
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:26,748
The head of the DPC, Mason King,
has been taken in for questioning

869
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:29,625
in connection with the
altered test scores.

870
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,429
I am appalled by the alleged
criminal action of Mr. King.

871
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:35,924
As of tomorrow morning, I am
appointing a special committee

872
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,702
to fully investigate what
really happened at Vista Point.

873
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:43,406
If Mr. King is guilty, he will
dearly pay for his unlawful actions.

874
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:45,633
Earlier reports indicating
a scandal involving

875
01:16:45,758 --> 01:16:47,977
Governor Redding
falsifying test information

876
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,505
were discredited when the
presidential hopeful revealed

877
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:54,776
his son Blake was among this
year's failing students.

878
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:57,512
My son, as much as I love him,

879
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:03,693
is no different than any
of your sons or daughters.

880
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:05,520
I'm not a hypocrite.

881
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,031
The laws apply to all of us.

882
01:17:09,156 --> 01:17:12,093
It just doesn't make it any easier.

883
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:16,264
I lost my son today.

884
01:17:19,366 --> 01:17:23,538
But I know in my heart
that he died for a purpose.

885
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:26,641
All of our fallen students have
made the ultimate sacrifice

886
01:17:26,766 --> 01:17:29,677
in the name of ensuring
a better tomorrow

887
01:17:29,802 --> 01:17:33,114
and in keeping America's future bright.

888
01:17:37,685 --> 01:17:42,057
I'd like to take a moment and
thank them for their courage.

889
01:17:57,872 --> 01:17:59,749
Hold it.

890
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:01,474
Okay, they're all clear.
