1
00:00:01,285 --> 00:00:03,663
(static buzzing)

2
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:07,483
- Beyond the trauma of human failure

3
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:10,846
lies the stillness of cosmic wisdom.

4
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:11,679
(static buzzing)

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,896
When people with poor wisdom
tread among sleeping tigers

6
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:16,993
(static buzzing)

7
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:18,916
they shall meet with disaster.

8
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,033
(static buzzing)

9
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:25,186
I have thrown the three coins six times.

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,546
I have read the upper and lower trigrams.

11
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:31,473
(static buzzing)

12
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:34,612
This reading is for
those who come after us.

13
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:35,957
(mysterious whirring)

14
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,207
Who survive us!

15
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,589
(static buzzing)

16
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,476
(static buzzing)

17
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:48,155
(mysterious whirring)

18
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,338
(static buzzing)

19
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:56,338
(static buzzing)
(static whooshing)

20
00:00:57,297 --> 00:01:00,146
(static buzzing)

21
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:03,063
(foreboding music)

22
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,993
(wind howling softly)

23
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,159
(foreboding music)

24
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,009
(adventurous music)

25
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:30,920
(thrilling music)

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,226
(mysterious music)

27
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,283
- [Link] Acting Captain Babylon.

28
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:02,563
- [Babylon] Yes.

29
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:04,803
- [Raven] You have to be ready.

30
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:06,293
- [Babylon] Raven?

31
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,626
- [Oracle] A one-eyed man is able to see.

32
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,256
A lame man is able to tread.

33
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:15,526
But he treads on the tail of the tiger.

34
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,406
The tiger bites the man.

35
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,834
And thus is the reading
of The Book of Changes.

36
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:26,417
(ominous electronic music)

37
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,418
(electricity whirring)

38
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:35,251
(Babylon gasping)

39
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,057
- Maybe it's time to clock out.

40
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,333
- (sighs) We're too close
to the planet, Kondor.

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,596
Need to stay frosty.

42
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:46,371
(buttons beeping)

43
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,466
- Aye, aye.

44
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,343
End of the rainbow dead ahead, Captain.

45
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:55,540
- Just fly it in a straight line, okay?

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,707
(electronics beeping)

47
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,358
(ship whooshing)

48
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,860
- [Kondor] Can you just think about it?

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,710
- (sighs) I guess I'm just an
old-fashioned girl, Kondor.

50
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,549
(sighs) I just think a marriage is

51
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,220
between two men and two women.

52
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,627
- You sound like my grandmas.

53
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,043
- Raven wasn't just a captain,
she was a great first wife.

54
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:26,263
And I don't think we're
ready for another captain

55
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,153
or a new wife.

56
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,845
Besides, you were brought on as a crewman,

57
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:32,212
not a third husband.

58
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:33,823
- Why not both?

59
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,113
- [Link] We are nearing Caliban.

60
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:37,943
Orbit in retrograde.

61
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:41,263
Terraforming is a three of five.

62
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:42,263
- Sounds good, Link.

63
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,556
Oh, what about the robot?

64
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:48,733
- Does that thing even
have a pleasure circuit?

65
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,883
- Depends on what you call pleasure.

66
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:54,733
- Crew member, Kondor, is that a question?

67
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:55,823
- Uh, no.

68
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,527
I'd rather not know.

69
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:00,110
(keys beeping)

70
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,715
(dramatic whooshing)
(energy blasting)

71
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:06,428
(mysterious music)

72
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:08,861
(light blasting)

73
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,528
(alarm blaring)

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,730
(Babylon sighing)
(alarm blaring)

75
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:24,398
(mysterious music)

76
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:29,716
(static buzzing)

77
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:34,716
(alarm blaring)
(man groaning)

78
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,219
- Link, do you have a reading on that?

79
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:42,219
(alarm blaring)
(eerie whirring)

80
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:46,567
What?

81
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,234
(alarm blaring)

82
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:52,733
Was that a passing meteor or something?

83
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,983
- Acting Captain Babylon,

84
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:57,123
it was from the surface of Caliban.

85
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:02,746
(machine buzzing)

86
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:05,219
- Somebody messing with us down there?

87
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,353
- Negative, Crew member Kondor.

88
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:10,950
There are no human lifeforms
registered on Caliban.

89
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,574
It is currently operated
by machine systems.

90
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,903
(machine whirring)

91
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:16,324
- Registered down there
and being down there

92
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,933
are two different things.

93
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:21,293
- Is that a question,
Acting Captain Babylon?

94
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,508
- Pirates?

95
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,433
- I don't know if there
are pirates out this far,

96
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,283
but there are 27 moons out here.

97
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:27,583
Hard to tell what this is.

98
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,762
This is the mining ship
Robert Indiana from the port

99
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:34,123
of Elysium Mons and flying a Martian flag.

100
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:36,093
Calling moon Caliban.

101
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,273
Again, this is the Robert
Indiana under Martian flag.

102
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,327
We have a license to repair
and maintain the mining

103
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:44,386
equipment under authorization
from the Pangaea Supergov.

104
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,403
- [Kidd] Babylon, it's Kidd.

105
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:48,516
I've got bad news.

106
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,465
- I don't need it, but go ahead.

107
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:53,443
- We got power dropping in
the engine since that blast.

108
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,543
What did we get hit with?

109
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:56,376
- Unknown.

110
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,193
All Link could tell us is
what it couldn't have been.

111
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:00,953
- Yeah, droids are funny that way.

112
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,606
What does your gut tell ya, Babs?

113
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,873
- I don't think it was
passing space debris.

114
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,723
It's from the surface.

115
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:08,723
- [Kidd] Roger that.

116
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:12,256
- Did you hit your head?

117
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,886
- [Babylon] I, I don't think so.

118
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:20,984
(explosion blasting)

119
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,497
(dramatic whirring)

120
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:23,638
Are you okay?

121
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:26,363
(objects clattering)

122
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,196
- Do you feel it?

123
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,193
- What?
- Under your ribs.

124
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:33,155
(machines buzzing)

125
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,988
(mysterious electronic music)

126
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:41,708
- We're falling, we're
falling toward Caliban!

127
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,493
Kidd, are you there?

128
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:47,923
- Here, Babs, but the engines are gone.

129
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,713
Get ready to tuck and roll.

130
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,175
- Good advice, Kidd.

131
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:54,425
(electricity whirring)

132
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:00,855
(announcer muttering)

133
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,183
- Have you checked on our husband?

134
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,483
- Oh, no.

135
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,083
He was supposed to be
checking on the mining drones.

136
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:09,633
Chafe, are you there?

137
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:10,928
Chafe?

138
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,813
- I'm good, Babylon.

139
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:14,248
Just took a tumble.

140
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:16,143
- You're about to take another one.

141
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,901
Everyone, hang on.

142
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,600
(mysterious electronic music)

143
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,433
(devices buzzing)

144
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,043
- Collision imminent, collision imminent.

145
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:30,313
Chance of survival of human crew--

146
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:31,543
- Shut up, Link!

147
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,376
- Hang on!

148
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,233
(dramatic music)

149
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,559
(ship crashing)

150
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,559
(metal scratching)
(devices buzzing)

151
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,526

(mysterious vocalizing)

154
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,550
(dramatic music)

155
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,562
(wind howling)

156
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:18,903
(static buzzing)

157
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,453
- [Raven] You have to be ready.

158
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:24,176
You have to be ready.

159
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,223
(electricity blasting)

160
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:29,746
Listen to him, Babylon.

161
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,536
Come back to us.

162
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,666
(electricity blasting)

163
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:44,026
- When people with poor wisdom
tread among sleeping tigers,

164
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,186
they shall meet with disaster.

165
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,049
(electricity blasting)

166
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:52,049
(creature growling)

167
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:58,427
(electricity blasting)

(energy blasting)
(Babylon groaning)

173
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:25,298
- Kondor?

174
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:31,672
(alarm blaring softly)

175
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,697
(keys beeping)

176
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:33,530
Kidd?

177
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:35,736
Kidd, are you there?

178
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:41,826
(keys beeping)
Chafe, is anyone there?

179
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:43,867
Link!

180
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:46,006
- Babs.

181
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,116
We're all going to die, Babs.

182
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:56,112
(eerie whooshing)

183
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,061
(energy blasting)

184
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:57,894
(Babylon screams)

185
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,243
- Hey, hey, whoa, you're all right.

186
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,653
You're all right.

187
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:01,486
Everyone's all right.

188
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,223
- I thought I saw.

189
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:05,423
- We crash landed, but
everyone's all right.

190
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:07,676
Are you all right?

191
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:09,859
- Nevermind that.

192
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:12,013
Link, status update?

193
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,736
- Caliban had its origins
in the Edgeworth Belt.

194
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:19,213
Moved by a gas strike in
the proto-planetary depths.

195
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:23,273
And before terraforming was
composed of methane, ammonium--

196
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:25,583
- Something freaking useful, Link!

197
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:29,363
- Acting Captain Babylon,
we have crash landed.

198
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,706
- Ain't robots great?

199
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:36,523
- There is a nearby
station designated A-119.

200
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,802
It could be the location of the attack

201
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:42,118
or it could be a source for assistance.

202
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,701
(wind howling)

203
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,089
(metal clanging)

204
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:54,653
- I thought this planet had
only been populated by machines?

205
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,416
- [Link] Crew member
Kondor, is that a question?

206
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,249
(devices buzzing)

207
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:05,263
- Everyone okay?
- Oh, husbands!

208
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:08,363
- This is all very sweet,
but I'm trying not to die

209
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:11,488
so if we could figure that out.

210
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,803
- (sighs) Caliban has gotten
to level three terraforming

211
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,713
so plenty of air, but
the scenery ain't great.

212
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,359
- (sighs) Link said there
was a base built here.

213
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,839
I'm assuming it was dropped from orbit

214
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,093
by the last mining mission
but it could be habitable.

215
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:30,163
- So what, we walk to
this base, this A-119?

216
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,653
- What base?

217
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:33,603
I thought the last mission was automated.

218
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:36,883
- Might have been left for
a later mining expedition.

219
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:39,179
- And if that's where the attack from?

220
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:42,557
- (sighs) Kidd, can we fix
the ship with what's here?

221
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:44,763
- (chuckles) Fix?

222
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,143
Maybe, fly back to the
space lanes. (grunts)

223
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,496
- And this base Link detected, is it safe?

224
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,183
- 50-50?

225
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:55,973
- 50-50, I'd say more like 25-75, but hey.

226
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:58,253
I ain't the acting captain, so.

227
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,653
Link?

228
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,753
- Is there a question?

229
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,510
- Man, I've had pocket
calculators more useful than you.

230
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,660
- (sigh) Let's figure
out a plan of action.

231
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,413
(wind howling)

232
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:12,529
- [Kidd] What are you doing?

233
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,913
- [Chafe] I'm starting new
mining drones while we're gone.

234
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:16,761
If we get back with a
hull full of dispersium,

235
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:19,461
we'll all be able to retire
and clone a bunch of kids.

236
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:24,183
- (sighs) I need to
ask you about something

237
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,603
strange that happened.

238
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:26,436
- Go on.

239
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:31,113
- We were hit with something,
some sort of blast,

240
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:34,773
but whatever it was gave
me a hell of a migraine.

241
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,543
- Did you hit your head?

242
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,623
- No, people need to stop asking me that.

243
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:40,453
I don't think so.

244
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,713
But even if I did, that's
not the weird part.

245
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:46,296
I've been having visions.

246
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,753
- Visions of what?

247
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:53,626
- Cloaked figures,
masked figures, and Link.

248
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:58,066
- Link what?

249
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,993
Acting Captain, are
you all right to serve?

250
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:06,043
- Stop calling me that,
Raven was the captain.

251
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,993
- But you are the one who has
to get us through this, Babs.

252
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:12,313
- [Babylon] I'm just
asking, Chief Engineer,

253
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,873
is it possible that we were
hit with a psychic blast?

254
00:14:14,873 --> 00:14:18,223
- That's like saying a
magic wand can fly the ship.

255
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:20,274
There's no psychic ability that we know of

256
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,423
of that magnitude.

257
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:24,246
- No human psychic power.

258
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:29,603
- This mining operation is
automated by robotics, Babs.

259
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,083
Those were the mission specs.

260
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,293
- I guess you've always
trusted the Pangaea Supergov

261
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,426
more than I do.

262
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,403
I don't think we ever
got a straight answer

263
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:40,505
on what made Raven sick
after that last repair run.

264
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,463
- (sighs) The Supergov
doctors said she had a

265
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,723
predetermined genetic inclination.

266
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:48,364
It had nothing to do with
whatever we ran into on Triton.

267
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:50,012
- Genetic inclination is a funny way

268
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:51,953
of saying it wasn't their fault.

269
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:53,612
- You're jumping at shadows.

270
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,546
- Am I?

271
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,603
- So, this dispersium
stuff's the real deal, huh?

272
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:03,818
- Well, if you mean dispersium can be used

273
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,576
as an energy source for
all types of engines, yeah.

274
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,693
- I wouldn't know about that,
I'm just a space jockey.

275
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:11,173
You're the route guy.

276
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,733
All I know is this
chick back at Tycho City

277
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,603
had some crushed up dispersium,

278
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,143
wanted me to snort it with her

279
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:18,787
the night before we shipped out.

280
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:19,623
(device beeping)

281
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:21,883
I mean, isn't the brain
just a wet machine?

282
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,583
I didn't do it, I told her I don't snort

283
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,956
crushed rocks up my nose, baby, but.

284
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:30,163
- I wouldn't know anything about that.

285
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,473
- Hey, you're right,
that's a lot of money.

286
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,283
Seems odd that Pangaea would
pick a small group like us

287
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:36,236
to do the mining.

288
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,146
- It's a long way from home

289
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,102
and there's a lot of bad
stories about this place.

290
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,676
- Bad stories?

291
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:47,693
- (sighs) Listen, we
did a lot of space runs

292
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,367
before you joined up, Kondor.

293
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:53,763
We lost our way from a repair
on Triton and there were a lot

294
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:56,963
of engineers that said we
shouldn't go there either.

295
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,808
- Who told you not to go there?

296
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:01,814
(Chafe sighs)

297
00:16:01,814 --> 00:16:03,364
We're not finished on that one.

298
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:05,616
- Everybody ready?

299
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:07,966
- Do we got a choice?

300
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:11,951
(tense music)

301
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:17,345
(wind howling)

302
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:26,314
(sand crunching)

303
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:39,411
(mysterious music)

304
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,938
- Transforming has proceeded by robotics

305
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:08,243
for 20 Martian years.

306
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,813
Oxygen levels are acceptable.

307
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,583
- It ain't exactly the
pleasure domes of Vegas, is it?

308
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,613
- We're miners, not pioneers.

309
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:19,589
- Well, we don't want to end
up pioneers, let's say that.

310
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,256
(eerie buzzing)

311
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:28,671
- The mining drones are on the move.

312
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,153
By the time we get the parts for the ship,

313
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:33,753
we should be well on our way
for a full load of dispersium.

314
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,101
- Let's do the same.

315
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:37,684
(wind howling)

316
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,187
(sand crunching)

317
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,696
- Wait, hold up a second.

318
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,344
- What is it?

319
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:08,656
- It looks like trails.

320
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,493
- I don't see any tracks.

321
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:12,993
- I don't mean machine tracks.

322
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,802
(wind howling)

323
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:22,276
- Is it an animal?

324
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,401
- Before the terraformers
landed here 20 years ago,

325
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,433
there wasn't any oxygen.

326
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,976
- I'd say it needed oxygen to survive.

327
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,343
Link.

328
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,886
- Is there a question, Crew member Kidd?

329
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:40,673
- Are there any other
bases in that direction?

330
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:44,096
- The only registered base is A-119.

331
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,799
- And it's the direction
we were already going?

332
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,136
- That is affirmative.

333
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,533
- What's your point, Kidd?

334
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,413
I know geography and I
can read surroundings,

335
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:58,533
and no machine made this.

336
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:02,223
- Calm down, I hate to see
Daddies and Mommy fight.

337
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:04,243
- Curiouser and curiouser.

338
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,310
We need to check this out.

339
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,983
- That's what guns are for.

340
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:08,441
- Let's go.

341
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:11,024
(wind howling)

342
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:19,992
(distant, eerie vocalizing)

343
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:29,444
(device beeping)

344
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,725
(mysterious music)

345
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:37,475
(device beeping)

346
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,358
(ground blasting)

347
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:44,358
(creature growling)

348
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,506
(mysterious music)

349
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:50,083
(creature growling)

350
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,166
(mysterious buzzing)

351
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:07,602
(sand crunching)
(wind howling)

352
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:31,097
There's something up there.

353
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:36,097
(sand crunching)
(wind howling)

354
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:51,063
- So, we're not the
first humans on Caliban.

355
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,463
- The mission launched 20 Earth years ago

356
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,486
on the ship Sigrid Unset.

357
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:58,963
The mission was to setup automation

358
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,913
to begin mining dispersium.

359
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:05,823
- I've flown the
spaceways for a long time,

360
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:10,343
moon to moon, and I've never
heard of a Sigrid Unset.

361
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:14,473
- Link, was the Sigrid Unset automated

362
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,983
or was it under human power?

363
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,280
- That information is not available

364
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,886
from the Pangaea Supergov.

365
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,681
- [Kondor] You gonna
answer already or what?

366
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,264
(wind howling)

367
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:31,283
- Link, was this station A-119 intended

368
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:34,765
to be a workstation for human miners?

369
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:36,355
- That information is not available

370
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:37,726
from the Pangaea Supergov.

371
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:41,463
- Are you finally ready
to slag this robot?

372
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:45,043
- So, that's why there weren't
any bids on this place.

373
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:46,598
I mean, I heard rumors in the spaceway

374
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,613
but there are always
rumors in the spaceway.

375
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:51,413
- Funny how much of that comes true.

376
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,773
- [Chafe] I know I've
seen this stuff before.

377
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,102
- So, the Sigrid Unset
didn't drop all the equipment

378
00:21:58,102 --> 00:22:00,373
and drones from orbit.

379
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:03,495
Somebody came down here
and started it all up.

380
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:04,878
- [Chafe] This is why they
used the ruddy old mining

381
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:07,003
drones, all right.

382
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:10,622
- Yeah, but how does
someone die holding one?

383
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:14,463
- Maybe this person had
an accident or an injury.

384
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,873
- No space burial?

385
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,493
I don't know a single space jockey

386
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,551
that someone would leave dirt-side.

387
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:22,943
(alarm blaring)

388
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:23,896
- Well, damn.

389
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,103
- Great, well, I'm guessing
he just killed himself.

390
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,413
Seriously?

391
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,226
- Try turning it off
then turning it back on.

392
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,976
- I hate it when the tech guys say that.

393
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:39,275
(eerie groaning)

394
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,606
- What the hell was that?

395
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:44,085
- Someone took down our ship?

396
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:45,240
- That's weird.

397
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,279
- It's coming from the ground not the sky!

398
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,112
Run!

399
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:49,301
(dramatic music)

400
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,992
(ground blasting)
(creature growling)

401
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:53,825
Run!

402
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:57,681
(Chafe screams)
Chafe, no!

403
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:59,018
(weapon blasting)

404
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:00,481
- Juice that bastard!

405
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:05,481
(weapons blasting)
(creature roaring)

406
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,642
(creature roaring)
(weapons blasting)

407
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,334
- Acting Captain, we gotta go.

408
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,318
(weapons blasting)

409
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:19,866
(creature roaring)

410
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,296
(Link buzzing)

411
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:22,533
- Is Link?
- Wait.

412
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:23,722
- We might need it.

413
00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:26,735
- I am honored, Acting Captain Babylon.

414
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,447
(thrilling music)

415
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:31,364
(creature roaring)

416
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:39,995
(creature roaring)
(creature screeching)

417
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:46,337
(thrilling music)

418
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:54,893
- What was that thing?

419
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,563
- Whatever it was, a snake, a worm,

420
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:59,193
it was the mining
equipment that drew it out.

421
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,487
- How?

422
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:03,483
- (sighs) It must have been
attracted to the sound.

423
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,103
I didn't see any eyes
on that thing, did you?

424
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,933
- I only saw teeth.

425
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,480
- [Kidd] Then it must have been sonar.

426
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,676
- What, you're a zoologist now?

427
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:15,343
- I'm being logical,
Kondor, try it sometime.

428
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,413
- I got this far on instinct, gearhead.

429
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:19,253
- Will both of you shut up?

430
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:23,410
Link, were there any indigenous
creatures on Caliban?

431
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,836
- It was not reported
to the Pangaea Supergov.

432
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,859
- So, the whole crew died before
they got to send a report.

433
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,948
It's been that way since the beginning.

434
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:36,156
- It's looking that way.

435
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:38,835
- And now the government waits 20 years

436
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:40,326
to send another crew.

437
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,043
So, it's all just a bunch
of spaceways rumors.

438
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:47,353
- It doesn't matter, we lost a husband.

439
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,993
It's just the two of
us now, don't you see?

440
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,856
- It doesn't have to be that way.

441
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:56,763
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, easy, easy.

442
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:59,531
We can mourn our husband soon,

443
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,553
but right now we gotta get to that base,

444
00:25:02,553 --> 00:25:05,983
get to ground, and figure
out what that was out here.

445
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:06,816
Link.

446
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:11,123
Are we still on track for A-119?

447
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:12,856
- Negative, Crew member Kidd.

448
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:16,598
- Can we get back on track?

449
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,619
- Affirmative, Crew member Kidd.

450
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,452
(thrilling music)

451
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,831
(wind howling)

452
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:36,208
(static buzzing)

453
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,625
(tense electronic music)

454
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,727
(static buzzing)

455
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:02,560
(energy whirring)

456
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,874
(static buzzing)

457
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,988
(light buzzing)

458
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,613
(static buzzing)

459
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,776
- My husband, my wife.

460
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:20,273
Do not fight the inhabitants.

461
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:22,986
Do not try to leave Caliban.

462
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:26,376
We can all be together once more.

463
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:31,236
We must embrace the world
that we are making together.

464
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:33,080
(static buzzing)

465
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,913
(energy whirring)

466
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,987
(energy whirring)
(energy buzzing)

467
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:44,993
(static buzzing)

468
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:46,816
- This is Oracle,

469
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:50,863
the official holder of The Book of Changes

470
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:53,773
for the Caliban mission.
(static buzzing)

471
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,916
I have thrown three coins six times.

472
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:01,186
I have read the upper and lower trigrams.

473
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:06,375
This reading is for
those who come after us,

474
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,810
who survive us.
(energy whirring)

475
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,585
(wind howling)

476
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:15,168
(uptempo electronic music)

477
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:46,292
(mysterious buzzing)

478
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:50,940
- Where did that come from?

479
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:54,509
It's that damn android!

480
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,230
- Link, status report.

481
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,572
- This unit seems to have sustained damage

482
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:02,480
in the indigenous beam attack.

483
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:06,083
(mysterious buzzing)

484
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,603
- He better shut that switch off

485
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,454
before I nail him down
and do a dinner plate.

486
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:13,353
- Like I said, we might need this android.

487
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:16,003
Link, shut off external sounds.

488
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,785
- [Link] That would include
my vocal parameters,

489
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:20,990
Acting Captain Babylon.
(Link buzzing)

490
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,573
- Finally, some good news!

491
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:26,541
- So, we're still on track to the base.

492
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,189
- Recalculating.

493
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:31,710
- Recalculating, damn, so
this thing broke its GPS.

494
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,543
(ground rumbling)

495
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:37,453
- Damn it!

496
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:42,453
(ground blasting)
(creature roaring)

497
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:47,340
(ground blasting)
(creature growling)

498
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,206
Damn it!

499
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,063
- Burn it fast!

500
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:54,063
(weapons blasting)
(creatures groaning)

501
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,418
(weapons blasting)

502
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:05,818
(weapons blasting)
(flames roaring)

503
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:12,061
(weapons blasting)
(creatures groaning)

504
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:16,913
- Think we got it?

505
00:29:16,913 --> 00:29:18,693
- It's ass wasn't totally on fire

506
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:20,493
so I don't think we got it.

507
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:22,633
We better use our inside voices.

508
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,540
- Do you have a new lock on A-119?

509
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:29,633
- Are you really gonna trust his ass?

510
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,680
- It's the only way.

511
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,566
(eerie vocalizing)

512
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:44,479
(sand crunching)
(wind howling)

513
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,900
(device buzzing)

514
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:01,085
(wind howling)
(sand crunching)

515
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,069
(device buzzing)

516
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:20,166
- Fine, so if this damn
thing's finally broken,

517
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,773
dibs on using its head as a salad bowl.

518
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,038
(thrilling music)

519
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,653
- Link, turn your voice back on.

520
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:31,206
Status report, quietly.

521
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:34,173
(electricity whirring)

522
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:37,296
- We have arrived at location A-119.

523
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:40,927
- Damn it, so this thing
is broken, we're screwed.

524
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,393
I mean, what, it's just gone?

525
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:46,766
- If it was a module dropped from a ship

526
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:49,471
it could have gotten moved somewhere.

527
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:51,456
- Was that a question?

528
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,623
- Damn it, Link, yes,
consider that a question.

529
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:58,246
- A-119 was not dropped from
the atmosphere, it was built.

530
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:03,583
- Okay, so if it was built
by humans or even bots

531
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,836
there had to be a foundation somewhere.

532
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,126
- Damn!

533
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,626
(tense music)

534
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,173
- There's a hatch over
there, help me move it.

535
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,733
- Uh, could be anything down there.

536
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,523
- Probably more skeletons.

537
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:22,516
- It ain't the dead I'm worried about.

538
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:29,755
(wind howling)
(sand crunching)

539
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:32,636
(ominous music)

540
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:41,321
(energy buzzing)
(door clatters)

541
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:43,988
(ominous music)

542
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:07,202
(footsteps pattering)

543
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,312
(creature roaring)

544
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:24,479
(footsteps pattering)

545
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,577
(ominous music)

546
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,760
(latch clatters)
(door creaks)

547
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,078
- Relax.

548
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:55,745
(door creaking)

549
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:02,657
(Kidd chuckles)
(door creaks)

550
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:05,907
(electricity whirring)

551
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,597
(mysterious music)

552
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,163
- Just more junk.

553
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:30,850
- Wait, I feel like there
might be some answers

554
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,563
here somewhere.

555
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:33,664
- If you can make
something out of this crap,

556
00:33:33,664 --> 00:33:35,573
you're a better engineer than I am.

557
00:33:35,573 --> 00:33:37,788
- That's not saying much.

558
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:41,371
(bright, mysterious music)

559
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:12,359
Come on, sweetheart.

560
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:15,776
(computer keys clicking)

561
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:20,706
(bright, mysterious music)

562
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:25,217
(computer keys clicking)

563
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:28,050
(buttons beeping)

564
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:32,900
- This is Oracle,

565
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:36,863
the official holder of The Book of Changes

566
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:38,336
for the Caliban mission.

567
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:46,850
I have thrown the three coins six times.

568
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,823
(static buzzing)

569
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:50,466
I have read the upper and lower trigrams.

570
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,876
This reading is for
those who come after us,

571
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,196
who survive us.

572
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,363
- Who survive us?

573
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:04,087
I wonder if the Oracle thought
it'd be 20 years later.

574
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:05,616
- The ship had an oracle?

575
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:09,483
- (sighs) 20 years ago, bigger
crews often had a member

576
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,213
who could read the I Ching.

577
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:13,193
The old captain swore by it.

578
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,169
- I mean I knew it happened,

579
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:17,784
I just never crewed a ship with an oracle.

580
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,193
- All right, you two figure this out.

581
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:21,139
I'm an old space jockey.

582
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:24,039
I don't like being down here
with nobody watching my segs.

583
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,385
I don't want to be down in a hole

584
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,076
with nobody watching the only way in.

585
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,216
- You do that then.

586
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:37,145
(mysterious music)

587
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:41,353
When I served on the Leonardo
Padoro we had an oracle.

588
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:43,060
- I didn't know that ship had an oracle.

589
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,653
What was that like?

590
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:47,253
- She was never wrong, if
that's what you're asking.

591
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:55,316
- Hidden dragon, dragon
appearing in a field.

592
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,675
Dragons fight in the meadow.

593
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:01,076
Their blood is black and yellow.

594
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:07,593
Horse and wagon parked, bloody tears flow.

595
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:11,866
Wading in the mud brings about
the arrival of the enemy.

596
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:14,436
Wading in blood.

597
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,226
Get out of the pits!

598
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,558
(mysterious music)

599
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,935
(mysterious vocalizing)

600
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:41,416
(mysterious music)

601
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,087
(energy whooshing)
(static buzzing)

602
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:51,670
(wind howling)

603
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:07,811
(mysterious music)

604
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,335
Get out of the pits!

605
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,232
Get out of the pits!

606
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,920
(wind howling)

607
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:30,557
(device beeping)

608
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:37,063
- After we get home, I'm
taking a milk run to Venus.

609
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,246
Screw this shit.

610
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,342
(ominous music)

611
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:47,663
Those oracles will mess with your mind.

612
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:50,400
I don't dick around
with that I Ching shit.

613
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,317
(eerie vocalizing)

614
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,600
Now, that's more like it.

615
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,513
It's one thing to shoot
a giant worm with teeth.

616
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:03,166
It's another to shoot a guy
in a mask with a bathrobe.

617
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:06,813
(eerie buzzing)

618
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,585
All right, buddy, I gave you a chance.

619
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,519
Not much of one, but.

620
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:13,352
(weapon blasting)

621
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:18,184
(eerie vocalizing)

622
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:22,842
(energy whirring)

623
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:31,475
(mysterious electronic music)

624
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:39,219
(eerie buzzing)

625
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:44,256
(mysterious electronic music)

626
00:38:46,515 --> 00:38:49,182
(eerie buzzing)

627
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:56,208
(mysterious electronic music)

628
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,048
- The one-eyed man is able to see.

629
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:35,673
A lame man is able to tread,

630
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,963
but he treads on the tail of the tiger.

631
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:42,059
The tiger bites the man,

632
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,574
and thus is the reading
of The Book of Changes.

633
00:39:45,574 --> 00:39:48,324
(static buzzing)

634
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:51,336
- Well?

635
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:54,106
- Keep both eyes open for a start.

636
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,452
- Nothin'.

637
00:40:00,072 --> 00:40:02,655
(Link buzzing)

638
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,034
(tense music)

639
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:10,654
(eerie vocalizing)

640
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:13,321
(eerie buzzing)

641
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:18,463
(eerie, mysterious music)

642
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,583
Hey, there's something up here.

643
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,319
Let's check it out.

644
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,819
(eerie, mysterious music)

645
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,636
(footsteps pattering)

646
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:35,933
Jackpot.

647
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,614
- Looks like 20 year old junk.

648
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:39,533
- Oh, I wouldn't call it 20 year old junk,

649
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:40,853
but it's 20 year old something.

650
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:42,543
- But will it work?

651
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,526
- It's worth a try.

652
00:40:44,604 --> 00:40:46,206
- Well, it's all we got, Kidd.

653
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:47,943
- Then I guess it has to work.

654
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:52,340
(static buzzing)

655
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,732
- The one-eyed man is able to see.

656
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:58,516
A lame man is able to tread,

657
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:02,963
but he treads on the tail of the tiger.

658
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:05,796
The tiger bites the man.

659
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,893
And thus is the reading
of The Book of Changes.

660
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:10,733
(static buzzing)

661
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:15,486
- My husband, my wife,
don't fight the inhabitants.

662
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:19,033
Don't try to leave Caliban.

663
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,405
We can all be together once more.

664
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:24,155
(static buzzing)

665
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,281
(mysterious music)

666
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:31,114
- Keep.

667
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:32,904
Chuck.

668
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,303
Keep.

669
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:36,823
Chuck.

670
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:40,685
Ooh, this little buddy is our ticket

671
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:42,843
back to the spaceways.

672
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:47,866
- Good, I was hoping this
wasn't a one-way trip.

673
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,760
(device beeping)
(device buzzing)

674
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:03,550
(ground blasting)
(creature roaring)

675
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,045
(thrilling music)

676
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:06,083
- It can't be.

677
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,904
- Turn it off, Kidd.

678
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:10,737
(ground rumbling)

679
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:15,639
(thrilling music)

680
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,472
- Run!

681
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:18,771
(wall exploding)

682
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:19,724
Run!

683
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:22,742
- No! (screams)

684
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:25,742
(creature growling)

685
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:30,591
(thrilling music)

686
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:32,923
Let's go, Link!

687
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:34,943
- Activating Protocol Nine.

688
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:36,433
- Link!

689
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,831
- Activating Protocol Nine.

690
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:42,063
Protocol Nine activated.
(creature growling)

691
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:44,896
(energy whirring)

692
00:42:59,065 --> 00:43:02,321
(energy whirring)

693
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:05,796
(energy whirring)
(energy buzzing)

694
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,464
- It's gone.

695
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:09,837
- [Link] Protocol Nine activated.

696
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,353
- Link?

697
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:12,186
- No.

698
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:14,844
(thrilling music)

699
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:20,128
(eerie vocalizing)

700
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:23,336
Babylon.

701
00:43:24,387 --> 00:43:26,963
(Babylon panting)

702
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:28,436
Babs, it's me.

703
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,726
Babs, it's Kidd.

704
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:40,699
- Kidd?

705
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:41,532
How?

706
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:46,103
- Before we left Mars, I
uploaded a copy of my brainwaves

707
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:48,602
into a personality circuit in Link.

708
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:52,037
Then I slaved that circuit
into my biorhythm monitor

709
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,406
so it would only kick in if I died.

710
00:43:56,763 --> 00:43:58,786
So, I'm dead, right, Babs?

711
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:02,863
- (sighs) Yes, you're dead.

712
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:07,303
- I did the upload before we left Mars

713
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:10,291
so I don't know what's
happened since then.

714
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,973
Are we on Caliban?

715
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:16,746
- (sighs) We're in the base
built by the first mission.

716
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:19,728
- And the rest of the crew?

717
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:22,488
- Kondor's watching the
backdoor to this place.

718
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:27,488
Chafe was killed by the same
creatures that killed you.

719
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:29,433
- Creatures?

720
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,926
- Some kind of giant worm.

721
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:35,293
- Seems like a crappy way
to die on a space mission.

722
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:38,896
- Well, these worms have
teeth, if that helps.

723
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:40,926
- I guess it does.

724
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:44,076
So, we lost Chafe and Raven this year?

725
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:49,642
Four have become two, maybe
a little less than two.

726
00:44:51,328 --> 00:44:54,088
- (sighs) Let's not think
like that right now.

727
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:56,493
You're here in some way.

728
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,016
You're still Kidd in some way.

729
00:44:58,923 --> 00:45:02,078
- You're right, of course you're right.

730
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:05,223
- (sighs) Right now we need
to get back to the ship.

731
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:06,693
- Well, the good thing is that I'm also

732
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:08,763
connected to our ship.

733
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:11,273
It needs repairs.

734
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:15,374
But I can see the schematics
so clearly even from here.

735
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:17,876
I think I can fix it.

736
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:20,263
- That's good 'cause the
parts you were needing

737
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:22,933
from here went down that creature's mouth.

738
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:26,763
- Along with me, the flesh me.

739
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:28,006
- Kidd.

740
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:31,573
- No, you're right,
this is actually better.

741
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:34,833
The mathematics of the universe
are so clear to me now.

742
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,523
I should have downloaded my personality

743
00:45:36,523 --> 00:45:38,280
into an android long ago.

744
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:42,669
(Babylon sighs)

745
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,132
(wind howling)

746
00:45:46,132 --> 00:45:49,049
(eerie vocalizing)

747
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,067
(tense music)

748
00:46:06,383 --> 00:46:08,873
You said Kondor was
watching this entrance?

749
00:46:08,873 --> 00:46:09,913
- Yeah.

750
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:12,193
Maybe he headed back to the ship.

751
00:46:12,193 --> 00:46:13,843
- Why would he go without us?

752
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:16,827
- I don't know, we'll just
ask him when we find him.

753
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:19,327
(tense music)

754
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,443
- That isn't a good sign, Babs.

755
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:27,295
He wouldn't have dropped that on purpose.

756
00:46:27,295 --> 00:46:29,943
- Then we need to catch up
to him, sooner than later.

757
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,091
Let's go, Kidd.

758
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,674
(quirky music)

759
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:41,013
- [Kidd] I'm in touch, with the ship.

760
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:46,013
We're not far away, she's
eager to be reunited with us.

761
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:49,225
- [Babylon] Don't forget
who you're married to.

762
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:52,142
(eerie vocalizing)

763
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:57,225
(tense music)

764
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:06,486
(eerie vocalizing)

765
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,283
I'm Captain Babylon from
mining shop Robert Indiana,

766
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,771
flying a Martian flag.

767
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,629
We mean no harm.

768
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:18,212
(wind howling)

769
00:47:19,863 --> 00:47:23,046
We ran into some creatures
and lost two crew members.

770
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:27,165
We are just trying to
get back to our ship.

771
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:29,806
We didn't know there were
other inhabitants here.

772
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,578
Were your people here
when the first ship came,

773
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:37,366
the Sigrid Unset?

774
00:47:40,093 --> 00:47:42,506
Did you know the crew
from the Sigrid Unset?

775
00:47:43,553 --> 00:47:46,043
Did you know the Oracle from that ship?

776
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:48,013
Do you know what happened to the crew?

777
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:49,950
Are any of them still alive?

778
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,353
We are here in peace!

779
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:54,863
We just want to get back to our ship.

780
00:47:54,863 --> 00:47:56,626
This is a peaceful mission.

781
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,863
- If we don't get out of
here, it won't be, come on.

782
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:07,971
(eerie vocalizing)

783
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,637
(energy buzzing)

784
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,770
(tense music)

785
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,286
(energy whirring)

786
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,869
(wind howling)

787
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:28,561
We gotta go back down below.

788
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:29,586
- It's a dead end.

789
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:36,056
- We're dead if we stay up here, Babs.

790
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,326
It's the only way, we gotta try.

791
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:43,762
(tense music)

792
00:48:43,762 --> 00:48:46,429
(door creaking)

793
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:49,326
They quit following us.

794
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,233
- Whatever they are.

795
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:52,903
We can't stay down here forever.

796
00:48:52,903 --> 00:48:55,713
- I know that, Babs, but
we need to figure out

797
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:58,963
who and what those beings are first.

798
00:48:58,963 --> 00:49:00,333
Maybe there are some more files

799
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,383
on that data station we
came across back there.

800
00:49:03,383 --> 00:49:05,773
In this form, I might
be able to dig deeper

801
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:07,124
than I could before.

802
00:49:07,124 --> 00:49:08,674
- (sighs) Let's give it a shot.

803
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:13,826
- [Raven] Babylon, Kidd.

804
00:49:16,168 --> 00:49:17,436
Babylon.

805
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:19,358
Kidd.

806
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:24,056
My wife, my husband.

807
00:49:25,143 --> 00:49:27,143
- [Kidd] That sounds like.

808
00:49:27,143 --> 00:49:28,143
- Raven?

809
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:29,943
- [Raven] You have to stop fighting.

810
00:49:31,683 --> 00:49:33,043
- No.

811
00:49:33,043 --> 00:49:35,166
- [Raven] I'm waiting for you.

812
00:49:36,503 --> 00:49:41,503
- That's Raven, but that doesn't compute.

813
00:49:41,873 --> 00:49:44,923
- [Raven] Caliban is waiting for you.

814
00:49:44,923 --> 00:49:48,253
- No, Raven would never
tell us to stop fighting.

815
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:49,546
- Does not compute.

816
00:49:51,716 --> 00:49:53,133
Does not compute.

817
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:59,039
(eerie vocalizing)

818
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:14,403
(device beeping)

819
00:50:22,763 --> 00:50:24,373
- Hold it together,
Kidd, I still need you.

820
00:50:24,373 --> 00:50:25,696
- I will.

821
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:32,838
(mysterious music)

822
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,949
(static buzzing)

823
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,563
- Anything?

824
00:50:47,563 --> 00:50:51,106
- This base is only sleeping.

825
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:55,866
- Beyond the trauma of human failure,

826
00:50:56,793 --> 00:51:00,432
lies the stillness of cosmic wisdom.

827
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:04,486
When people with poor wisdom
tread among sleeping tigers,

828
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,666
they shall meet with disaster.

829
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:10,926
- Can you change the
channel on that thing?

830
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,553
(device beeping)
(static buzzing)

831
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:15,646
- My husband, my wife.

832
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:17,486
- Raven?

833
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,213
Raven?

834
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:22,845
- Don't fight the inhabitants.

835
00:51:22,845 --> 00:51:25,236
Don't try to leave Caliban.

836
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,266
We can all be together again.

837
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:32,760
- Kidd, that can't be Raven.

838
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,853
- My logic circuits are not registering.

839
00:51:35,853 --> 00:51:38,243
- But it just can't be.

840
00:51:38,243 --> 00:51:40,763
- We must all embrace the world

841
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:43,678
that we are making together.
- Raven.

842
00:51:43,678 --> 00:51:44,511
Raven.

843
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:47,962
(electricity crackling)

844
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:48,900
- Kidd!

845
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,834
(loud buzzing)

846
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:54,409
What now?
(electricity crackling)

847
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:55,242
Kidd!

848
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:58,295
Kidd, no!
(loud buzzing)

849
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:00,257
(loud buzzing)

850
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:02,362
Kidd, I can't lose you a second time.

851
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:03,667
You're all that's left.

852
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,148
- I...

853
00:52:05,148 --> 00:52:07,798
I can feel the circuits fading.

854
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:08,631
- No.

855
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:13,515
- But it doesn't hurt, Babs.

856
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:16,060
- It's, it's hurting me!

857
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,701
- Babylon, let me tell you something.

858
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:23,643
I downloaded my consciousness into Link,

859
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,371
but I also downloaded my consciousness

860
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:27,276
into a probe on the ship.

861
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:31,933
It launched when my first body died.

862
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:33,316
It's beyond Pluto now.

863
00:52:34,553 --> 00:52:36,136
Beyond Hydra now.

864
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,153
It's beyond Styx now.

865
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:40,876
- Kidd, stay with me!

866
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:45,212
- I am beyond any place any
human mind has ever seen.

867
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:48,246
Babs, there are other human beings

868
00:52:48,246 --> 00:52:50,746
out here beyond human knowledge.

869
00:52:52,363 --> 00:52:53,513
I'm going to know them.

870
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:59,381
(distorted) One day
you may know them, too.

871
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:03,096
(Kidd buzzing)

872
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:06,333
(Babylon sighs)

873
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,173
(loud whirring)

874
00:53:08,173 --> 00:53:10,756
One day you may know them, too.

875
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,694
(device beeping)

876
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,450
But I also downloaded my consciousness

877
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,561
into a probe on the ship.

878
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:31,624
It launched when my first body died.

879
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:34,959
(eerie vocalizing)

880
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:37,610
(mysterious music)

881
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,193
(wind howling)

882
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:46,881
(static buzzing)

883
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:53,190
(mysterious whirring)

884
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:58,093
(dramatic thudding)

885
00:53:58,093 --> 00:54:00,743
- I don't know how to kill
you or if you can even die,

886
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:02,576
but I have to try, don't I?

887
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:04,306
I don't have anything else left.

888
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:07,288
You're not just the inhabitants

889
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:09,613
of this half-formed planet.

890
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:13,096
You are, you are the
original crew, aren't you?

891
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:20,273
The worms are the native species.

892
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:22,173
You don't have anything to do with it!

893
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,806
What happened to you?

894
00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:36,328
(static buzzing)

895
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:43,749
What did they do to you, Kondor?

896
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:48,726
What did they do to your brain?

897
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:52,006
- They did nothing.

898
00:54:54,003 --> 00:54:55,641
- No!

899
00:54:55,641 --> 00:55:00,466
- The minerals we're mining, the dust.

900
00:55:01,823 --> 00:55:05,546
It's in the air, it gets in your brain.

901
00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:12,166
It works on your brain, we're evolving.

902
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:19,362
And it's beautiful.

903
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:24,136
- It's, it's not you anymore, Kondor!

904
00:55:25,473 --> 00:55:28,173
It's not human, it's alien!

905
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:30,757
It's not evolution at all.

906
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:35,757
- It's better, I'm better than human now,

907
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:37,426
and you will be, too.

908
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,263
- No.

909
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:41,946
- You will join us.

910
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:47,386
When the next mission
comes, whenever it comes,

911
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:53,226
we will welcome them, too.

912
00:55:54,823 --> 00:55:57,736
- No, there won't be anymore missions!

913
00:56:00,043 --> 00:56:01,593
- There will be a next mission,

914
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:05,036
even if it is in 20 years.

915
00:56:07,149 --> 00:56:09,016
The minerals here are too valuable.

916
00:56:10,513 --> 00:56:13,703
- When the government knows
what these minerals can do...

917
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,736
- They already know.

918
00:56:17,147 --> 00:56:20,213
There will be another
mission and another mission.

919
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:26,551
And we will grow stronger.

920
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:27,384
- No!

921
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:31,466
Goodbye.

922
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:34,706
- This is not goodbye.

923
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:39,398
(weapon blasting)

924
00:56:39,398 --> 00:56:42,623
(light whirring)

925
00:56:42,623 --> 00:56:46,331
You were a good pilot, Kondor,
despite the rest of it!

926
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:49,248
(eerie vocalizing)

927
00:56:51,305 --> 00:56:54,055
(static buzzing)

928
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:59,325
(eerie vocalizing)

929
00:57:00,703 --> 00:57:02,530
- [Raven] Listen to him, Babylon.

930
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:05,666
Come back to us!

931
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:09,786
My husband, my wife.

932
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:13,316
Do not fight the inhabitants.

933
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:16,796
Do not try to leave Caliban.

934
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,856
We can all be together once more.

935
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:25,876
We must embrace the world
that we are making together.

936
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:30,146
You have to be ready.

937
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:34,623
You have to stop fighting.

938
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:36,496
I'm waiting for you.

939
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:42,200
Caliban is waiting for you.
(eerie vocalizing)

940
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:46,128
(ominous music)

941
00:57:49,744 --> 00:57:51,744
- The simulation's over.

942
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:54,597
- What?

943
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,177
- The simulation's over.

944
00:57:57,177 --> 00:58:00,283
- What, what are you saying?

945
00:58:00,283 --> 00:58:02,193
- [Raven] Listen to him, Babylon!

946
00:58:02,193 --> 00:58:04,866
Come back to us!

947
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:09,133
Do not fight the inhabitants.

948
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:11,616
Do not try to leave Caliban.

949
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:15,431
We can all be together once more.

950
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:16,492
(Babylon panting)

951
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,325
- No!

952
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:18,943
- [Raven] We must
embrace the world that we

953
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:20,795
are making together.

954
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:23,628
(thrilling music)

955
00:58:24,778 --> 00:58:29,778
(weapon blasting)
(dramatic whooshing)

956
00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:35,131
(explosions blasting)

957
00:58:42,403 --> 00:58:47,403
(eerie whirring)
(wind howling)

958
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:53,266
- Run!

959
00:58:55,207 --> 00:58:56,040
Run!

960
00:59:01,966 --> 00:59:05,898
- This is the mining ship Robert Indiana

961
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:10,898
from the port of Elysium Mons
and flying the Martian flag.

962
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:16,583
Calling on Caliban.

963
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:21,000
Again, this is the Robert
Indiana under Martian flag,

964
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:25,114
calling the moon Caliban.

965
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:30,811
We have a license to repair
and maintain the mining

966
00:59:30,811 --> 00:59:35,811
equipment under authorization
from the Pangaea Supergov.

967
00:59:38,764 --> 00:59:40,309
(static buzzing)

968
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:41,142
No!

969
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:46,409
(mysterious music)

970
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:49,586
Kidd?

971
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:53,596
- Acting Captain Babylon.

972
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:56,273
- I...

973
00:59:56,273 --> 00:59:59,480
I'm on Mars?

974
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,562
(devices buzzing)

975
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:07,562
(device beeping)
(wind howling)

976
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:13,283
- We are in the training
center at Olympus Mons.

977
01:00:13,283 --> 01:00:17,103
You have been in deep REM VR.

978
01:00:17,103 --> 01:00:19,936
Your orientation to reality
should return momentarily.

979
01:00:22,514 --> 01:00:25,380
- We were supposed to go to Caliban.

980
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,523
- The Pangaea Supergov required your crew

981
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:31,373
to simulate the mission
first for viability.

982
01:00:31,373 --> 01:00:35,196
Result, the simulation of
the mining mission to Caliban

983
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:36,470
is over.

984
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,396
The mission will be a failure.

985
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:41,833
- A failure.

986
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:44,986
- You have returned to reality,
Acting Captain Babylon.

987
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:48,406
Are you in operating status?

988
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,114
- I'm okay.

989
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:54,053
Good thing we ran that simulation.

990
01:00:54,053 --> 01:00:56,546
But there were a lot of
weird glitches in there.

991
01:00:57,483 --> 01:00:59,753
- Acting Captain Babylon,

992
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:02,455
those with strong emotions, a strong will,

993
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:06,133
can sometimes overwhelm the simulation.

994
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:09,996
It is clear from your simulation
that you and your husbands

995
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:13,303
are not ready to return to space flight

996
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:17,006
since the death of your first
wife and captain, Raven.

997
01:01:18,696 --> 01:01:20,345
- No, that's not all of it.

998
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:22,932
There were those weird people on Caliban.

999
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:24,820
What was that about?

1000
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,846
- An extrapolation of scenarios.

1001
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:33,103
- So, there was an original
human crew sent to Caliban,

1002
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:34,655
like in the simulation.

1003
01:01:34,655 --> 01:01:37,103
(devices beeping)

1004
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:38,686
- It can be extrapolated.

1005
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:41,928
- And what happened to them?

1006
01:01:41,928 --> 01:01:44,093
(devices beeping)

1007
01:01:44,093 --> 01:01:46,603
- That cannot be extrapolated from data

1008
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:48,286
supplied by the Pangaea Supergov.

1009
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:52,606
- (sighs) Well, that sounds familiar.

1010
01:01:55,063 --> 01:01:56,313
Where are Kidd and Chafe?

1011
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,566
- Just finishing their own simulations.

1012
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:02,663
- I need to see them.

1013
01:02:02,663 --> 01:02:03,503
We...

1014
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:06,423
We need time together.

1015
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,786
- Acting Captain Babylon, a
reminder that the simulation

1016
01:02:09,786 --> 01:02:12,963
will fade from your mind in a short time.

1017
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,334
The scenario you experienced

1018
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:17,713
in the simulation was
just that, a simulation.

1019
01:02:19,287 --> 01:02:23,102
- That's good, there's
a lot I want to forget.

1020
01:02:23,102 --> 01:02:26,036
But maybe a few things good to remember.

1021
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:31,028
(device droning)

1022
01:02:31,028 --> 01:02:32,236
Husbands!

1023
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,233
- How did you guys do?

1024
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:41,483
In my simulation, the
engines kept conking out

1025
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:43,407
and we never even made it to the planet.

1026
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:46,153
- In my simulation, the
mining drones hadn't gotten

1027
01:02:46,153 --> 01:02:48,503
far enough into the
terraforming to sustain us.

1028
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,756
- How about you, Babs?

1029
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:57,970
- The planet was hostile,
we didn't make it.

1030
01:02:59,703 --> 01:03:01,003
- Wow.

1031
01:03:01,003 --> 01:03:03,326
So, I guess we all had a total party kill.

1032
01:03:04,923 --> 01:03:05,823
- I survived mine.

1033
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:11,543
- Well, it's a good thing
the Supergov gave us these

1034
01:03:11,543 --> 01:03:14,183
simulations before they
gave us the contract.

1035
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:16,306
Saved everybody a lotta time.

1036
01:03:17,513 --> 01:03:18,673
- Yeah.

1037
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:20,843
Guess we weren't ready for Caliban.

1038
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:22,003
- I'll tell you what, we'll keep looking

1039
01:03:22,003 --> 01:03:25,123
for another repair contract,
maybe the other direction,

1040
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:26,483
towards Sol. (chuckles)

1041
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:28,653
I wouldn't mind being warm for a change.

1042
01:03:28,653 --> 01:03:30,013
- Sure.

1043
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:32,610
But where's Kondor?

1044
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:37,506
- Who's Kondor?

1045
01:03:39,548 --> 01:03:40,836
- Nevermind.

1046
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:45,526
- Seems like your simulation
was a little rough.

1047
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,943
- Mine just had some weird stuff in it.

1048
01:03:48,943 --> 01:03:50,016
Raven was there.

1049
01:03:52,209 --> 01:03:53,136
- Raven?

1050
01:03:58,473 --> 01:04:00,643
- Yeah, hey, don't worry about it.

1051
01:04:00,643 --> 01:04:03,193
The important thing is
that we're all together.

1052
01:04:03,193 --> 01:04:04,433
- What else would we be?

1053
01:04:04,433 --> 01:04:07,696
After Raven, now more than ever.

1054
01:04:07,696 --> 01:04:09,446
- Now more than ever.

1055
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:13,896
Thank you, Link.

1056
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,020
(eerie vocalizing)

1057
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,876
(light whooshing)

1058
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:21,922
(eerie electronic music)

1059
01:04:21,922 --> 01:04:24,638
(light whooshing)

1060
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:28,055
(eerie electronic music)

1061
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:38,801
(light whooshing)

1062
01:04:39,703 --> 01:04:42,536
Link, is this real?

1063
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:46,266
- Is that a question?

1064
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:49,853
- No.

1065
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,183
- Acting Captain Babylon,

1066
01:04:53,183 --> 01:04:55,936
are you returned to operating status?

1067
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,243
(mysterious music)

1068
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:02,436
- [Raven] My husband, my wife.

1069
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:06,853
Don't fight the inhabitants.

1070
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:08,756
Don't try to leave Caliban.

1071
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:13,127
We can all be together once more.

1072
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:15,960
(devices beeping)

1073
01:05:17,296 --> 01:05:19,879
(wind howling)

1074
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:27,343
(mysterious music)

1075
01:05:43,395 --> 01:05:45,978
(wind howling)

1076
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:02,742
(eerie vocalizing)

1077
01:06:03,637 --> 01:06:04,697
(static buzzing)

1078
01:06:04,697 --> 01:06:08,447
(energetic electronic music)

1079
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,893
(energetic vocal music)

1080
01:07:26,858 --> 01:07:30,608
(energetic electronic music)

1081
01:10:04,228 --> 01:10:05,700
(static buzzing)
