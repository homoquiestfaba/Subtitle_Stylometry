Is this our new Airbnb.

00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,442
No.

00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,945
Madison, this is our new home.

I'm not lying, baby.

00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,754
Are you serious?

45
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,456
I love this.

00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,593
Yes.

48
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,230
This is the best surprise.

49
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,231
Oh, I love you.

00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,467
I knew you would be surprised.

51
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,035

52
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,270

00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,108
at our new house, all right?

55
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,112
Babe, I knew you had
something up your sleeve like-

56
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,480
I told you.

57
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,614
This is beautiful.

58
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,615
Do you love it?

59
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,117
I love it.

60
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,351
I love it.

61
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,320
You know what I think we should do?

62
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,688
Right now.
What?

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,957
We should toast to our brand new home.

64
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,392
We should toast.

65
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,661
Ooh, champagne.

66
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,030
Nah, that's a little wine, baby.

67
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,031
Oh, okay.

68
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,333
You know I like to do things different.

69
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,335
I love it.

70
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,338
Let's do this toast.

71
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,339
Thank you.

72
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,277
To a perfect woman, to a perfect evening

73
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,516
and to our perfect brand new house, baby.

74
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,483
Love you.

75
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,020
Mm.

76
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,524
I love you, too.
Ooh, this is good.

77
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,494
I really love this space.

78
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,197
I can really feel my
interior design touches

79
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,066
on this open concept.

80
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,333
Yeah, I know.

81
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,001
I mean, look at this fireplace.

82
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,704
It's on both sides of the room.

83
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,939
It's beautiful.

84
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,475
Oh, my God.

85
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,145
It couldn't get any better than-

86
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,782
Babe, what are you doing?

87
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh, my God, Preston.

88
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,754
What are you doing?

89
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,190
Madison Givens.

90
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,560
You're my world, baby.

91
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,096
I wanna be with you forever.

92
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,798
I love you with all my heart.

93
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,470
So it's my job to ask
you will you marry me?

94
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,607
Oh, babe, get up, get up, I love you.

95
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,608
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,380
So, whoa, is that a yes?

97
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,851
Not yet.

98
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,121
What do you mean?

99
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,457
I made a promise to my dad

100
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,359
that I would never get married

101
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,194
unless he approved of the guy.

102
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,229
But I don't understand,

103
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,631
I thought you would say yes.

104
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,634
It's not that I don't want to.

105
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,635
It's just that I made a promise

106
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,872
and I have to keep that promise.

107
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,342
But, Madison, I've never met your dad.

108
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,843
Your family lives in D.C.

109
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,513
How am I supposed to get to know him?

110
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,847
We can go there for Thanksgiving

111
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,315
and spend a week there.

112
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:21,119
I'm sure you could win
him over in a week, right?

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,521
Yeah, but remember we were supposed

114
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,257
to go visit my parents
for Thanksgiving week.

115
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,958
They had the week planned for us.

116
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,094
Like what am I supposed to tell my parents?

117
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,862
Just tell them the truth.

118
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,364
You have to meet my family because

119
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,133
we wanna get married.

120
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,239
You know what?

121
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,942
I'll do anything to marry you.

122
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,444
Thanks, babe.

123
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,279
Let's go to D.C.

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,548
Oh, they're gonna love you.

125
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,185
They are going to love you,
trust me, I can't wait.

126
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,786
Let's go break this house in.

127
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,787
Yeah.

128
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,324
Let's go break it in.

129
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,463
I love big booty hos.

130
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,537
I love big booty hos.

131
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,306
Kim got a big old butt.

132
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,574
What the fuck?

133
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,043
What the hell you stabbed me for.

134
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,044
Get out of the room.

135
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,278
Get your shit out.

136
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,114
Damn, I thought he was at work.

137
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,115
Go.

138
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,350
Not there.

139
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,551
Get your shit.

140
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,188
Under the bed, I can't...

141
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,394
What the hell y'all doing?

142
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,595
Y'all talking to somebody in here?

143
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,029
No, baby.

144
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,866
You see what we doing.

145
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,170
I thought you was supposed
to be at work anyway.

146
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,605
The club got raided.

147
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,673
Feds came in and shut that joint down.

148
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,275
What?

149
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,945
Well, since you're already here,

150
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,349
do you want some of this?

151
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,151
Hell, yeah.

152
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,688
Come on, baby, come give me some of that.

153
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,965

00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,302
He's a great guy, you'll see.

00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,137
Man, you got some gas money?

250
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,740

251
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,975
I'm a professional driver.

252
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,279
Oh, yeah, let me see here.

253
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,082

00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,926
Man, I'm an executive chauffeur.

257
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,961
This little hundred dollars ain't shit.

258
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,733
I usually charge 300
for something like this.

259
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,836

Giving you an extra two.

That's a whole 300, that should cover it.

266
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,616
This might work, that
may be two cheeks slappin'.

267
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,752
Alonzo, let's go, we're cold and tired

268
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,287

All right, come on, let's go.

All right, I gotta make

274

00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,440
Babe, it's not a problem.

00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,108
Just let your brother handle his business.

277
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,643
We're good now.

278
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,647
Fine, one stop and it

Okay, that's no problem.

Nerd ass nigga.

Oh, my God.

412
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,666
Honey, is that you?

413
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,934

420
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,219
Don't say shit.

421
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,687
You know what?

422
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,291
See, this just don't make no goddamn sense.

423
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,861
Can y'all remember the last time

424
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,462
the family got together?

425
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,965
Can you say hot mess?

426
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,199
Hot mess.

427
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Okay.

428
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,738
Cuckoo for cocoa puffs child.

429
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,908
Oh, that's probably
Leroy and Pork Chop now.

430
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,978
Hoo, time to get started.

431
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,556

432
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,557
Pork Chop.

433
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,559
I'm so glad you made it.

434
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,462
Thanksgiving wouldn't
be the same without you.

435
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,032
Goddamn, this house big as shit.

436
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,401
We damn sure don't need no hotel Pork Chop.

437
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,069

444
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,715
I'm about to get on Plenty 'O Fish.

445
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,984
Uh-huh, leave your catch outside.

446
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,819
How was your trip?

447
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,054
It was all right, you
know, you drive once,

448
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,290
you drive twice, you drive.

449
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,158
Oh, what the hell?

450
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,159
What the fuck?

451
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,661
Get this motherfucker off of me.

452
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,729
Roy, get him.

453
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,232
Hey, make him get off my brother.

454
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,901
Get off my brother, get

455
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,871
Get this motherfucker.

456
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,839
Roy, go up out the truck.

457
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,208
I'm about to put a cap

458
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,377
Crazy bastard.

459
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,478
Shit.

460
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,348
Ol' wildebeest looking motherfucker.

00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,684
I'll shoot him myself.

462
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,519
I think it's her.

463
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,853
My baby is here.

464
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,265
Oh, man, it's just your stink breath ass?

465
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,733
I thought you was somebody important.

466
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,968
I knew it smelled like a pig threw up

467
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,169
in this motherfucker.

468
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,672
Uncle Leroy, what, I am somebody.

469
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,010
Oh, y'all thought it was the
little princess, Madison?

470
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,714
Well, I hate to disappoint y'all.

00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,149
Anyways, baby, how are you?

472
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,885

474
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,622
And how come you ain't never throw me

475
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,623

476
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,157
Girl, you live down the street

477
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,927
and you've never been outside the DMV.

478
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,395
Whatever, Ma.

479
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,765
Where is she anyway,
I gotta go to work tomorrow.

480
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,469
Miranda, you haven't seen
your sister in four years.

481
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,171
You can wait a little while
longer, miss antsy pants.

482
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,172
Ma.

483
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,407
Ah, ah.

Okay, all right, all right, fine.

485
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,945
I'll wait, but I'm not waiting all night.

486
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,847
Get on my nerves.

487
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,782
Go girl.

488
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,917

Who the hell is this nigga?

508
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,752
Daddy, this is my boyfriend, Preston.

509
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,988
He's gonna be with us for the week.

510
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,824
Your boyfriend, huh?

511
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,693
What the hell you doing
here with my daughter?

512
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,428
I'm here to spend Thanksgiving week

513
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,764
with you and your family, sir.

514
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,499
Did she tell you I was crazy as hell?

515
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,767
Oh, no, sir, she didn't.

516
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,302
Daddy, stop.

517
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,369
My daddy wouldn't hurt anyone.

518
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,572
He's just joking, babe.

519
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,840
She done went down to Florida

520
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,374
and came back with Peewee Sherman.

521
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,477
Whoa, exactly, what the
hell is Smeegle doing here?

522
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,681
Is precious trying to find the ring.

523
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,384
It's just my uncle.

524
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,689
How you doing, nice to meet you.

525
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,457
My man, Von.

526
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,392
What's going on, Pops?

527
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,160
All right, how you doing, son?

528
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,994
I'm good.

529
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,194
All right.

530
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,462
Bet you came to see your girl, huh?

531
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,630
What girl?

532
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,234
No, don't worry about it, no.

533
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:28,407
Uh, uh, uh, whoa.

534
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,374
Who the fuck is

535
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,842
this little mini nigga clearing his throat?

536
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,378
Von, this his my boyfriend, Preston.

537
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,646
Preston.

538
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,914
What?

539
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,015
How the hell is he your boyfriend

540
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,383
when I'm your fiance?

541
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,584
Von.
No.

542
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,386
We are not going to do this right now.

543
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,622
I broke that off four years ago, okay.

544
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,392
Yeah, okay, but I'm your first.

545
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,728
She can never get rid of her first,

546
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,398
especially not for no baby Smurf ass nigga.

547
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,234
This family's disrespectful, I see.

548
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,235
I'm sorry.

549
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,970
Excuse me, anyway.

550
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,173
Daddy, where is our room?

551
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,874
Our room?
Yes.

552
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,176
Baby, your room is downstairs.

553
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,378
Your little boyfriend
can sleep in the garage.

554
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,613
Garage?
Wow.

555
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,450
Anyway, babe, can you take
our bags downstairs, please.

556
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,452
Yes, I will.

557
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,620
Whoa.

558
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,324
Get his ass, Rufus, get his ass.

559
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,693
Hey, you went to the Smurf convention

560
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,228
and found a Smurf?

561
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,729
Where the hell you get this dude from?

562
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,765
You gonna pick him over Von.

563
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,434
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la

564
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,137
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la

565
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,272

566
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,174
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la

567
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,542
Uncle Rufus, eat Smurf.

568
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,646
Maurice, you gotta do
something about this.

569
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,686
Everybody, I just wanted to say

570
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,788
that it is so good to have

571
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,492
the whole family here for Thanksgiving.

572
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,261
We are truly blessed.

573
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,600
I always prayed for a large home filled

574
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,036
with the love of family.

575
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,472
Now can y'all do me a favor

576
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:12,444
and be on your best
behavior this week, okay?

577
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,481
Y'all see how she
looking at me like that?

578
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,718
I don't even appreciate it.

579
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,919
Anyway.

580
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,389
Hey, Amaya, oh, my gosh,
you are getting so big.

581
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,892
Hey, big cuz, yeah,
it's been a long time.

582
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:28,893
Mm.

583
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,395
Girl, what you looking for?

584
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,396
Your man.

585
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,598
I'm done.

586
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,401
Why are you so bad?

587
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,836
Why are you so ugly?

588
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,006
Oh, Pork Chop.

589
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,574
You don't be disrespecting me up in here.

590
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,109
I wish you would, I wish you would.

591
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,079
Amaya Jackson, uh-uh, you
apologize right this minute.

592
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,815
I'm sorry you're so ugly.

593
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,284
Oh, now.

594
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,287
Amaya, you take your
butt downstairs right now.

595
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,222
Damn demon child.

596
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,359
India Foulri, you about to get this belt.

597
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,128
Girl, I am so glad to see you.

598
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,664
It has been way too long.

599
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,232
Why are you here?

600
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,101
You haven't been here
in four or five years.

601
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,604
Well, I wanted everyone to meet Preston

602
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,839
and I missed everyone, too.

603
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,675
Where's David? Is he coming?

604
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,276
Girl, please, you know
damn well David left me

605
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,678
a few years ago.

606
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,246
Oh, wait, that's right, you don't know,

607
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,281
'cause you was off in Florida living

608
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,917
in your little fairy tale world.

609
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,285
No, I don't know because

610
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,887
you never tell me anything.

611
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,689
Pick up the damn phone.

612
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,425
Miranda, why are you so bitter?

613
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,026
I have never done anything to you.

614
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,828
Please, I'm not kissing your ass

615
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,463
like everybody else in this house.

616
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,165
You still my little sister.

617
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,399
You still the same little girl

618
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,270
that used to piss the bed every night.

619
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,205
You know what?

620
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,973
I came here excited to see you

621
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,975
and you still got that stick up your ass.

622
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,276
And you better watch his ass

623
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,610
before somebody steal him.

624
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,446
What?

625
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,779
You heard me.

626
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,215
Whatever, Miranda.
Whatever then.

627
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,051
Oh, man, look at us.

628
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,587
The three amigos together again.

629
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,155
Boy, get off of me Alonzo,

630
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,290
we ain't close like that.

631
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,291
Whoa.

632
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,560
Please.

633
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,495
You over here because the
little princess is here.

634
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,429
What the hell is wrong with you?

635
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,064
I see why.

636
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,767
Girl, I been dodging that breath.

637
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,202
Girl, your breath smell
like Grandma's house

638
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,737
after she been cooking chitlins

639
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,438
and she ain't scrape all the doo-doo out,

640
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,774
'cause she says she thinks it spicy.

641
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,743
On my nerves.

642
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,744
Oh!

643
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,912
I'm a be sick!

644
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,418
Babe, I really don't think

645
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,520
I should ask your dad now.

646
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,322
I just don't think he likes me.

647
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,990
No, babe, he's just like that

648
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,659
when he first meets people.

649
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,661
But did you see how he shook my hand?

650
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,563
He almost broke it.

651
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,699
I'm still in pain.

652
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,969
Well, once he gets
to know the man I know,

653
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,272
he's not gonna be able to say no.

654
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,509
You think so?
I know so.

655
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,281
Let me take these glasses off.

656
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,519
Let's have some fun.

657
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,824
♪ Don't need to be all up in

658
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,060
♪ Show me all you

659
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,262
♪ Show me you're true

660
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:22,466
♪ I wanna love

661
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,202
♪ Show me all you

662
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,804
If you don't get your goddamn hands

663
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,705
off my baby girl,

664
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,474
I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker.

665
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,475
Daddy, no.

666
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,610
Please don't shoot me, please.

667
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,412
I told your ass you're
sleeping in the garage.

668
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,347
Now, nigga, get your shit.

669
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,282
Please don't kill me.

670
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,149
Daddy, he didn't do anything.

671
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,185
Please put the gun down.

672
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,187
Preston, can you go upstairs

673
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,089
so I can talk to daddy please.

674
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,690
Please.

675
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,691
Oh.

676
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:55,933
Really, Daddy?

677
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,801
Where you find this man?

678
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,138
Daddy, can you please
give him a fair chance.

679
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,139
Look.

680
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,843
Since it's you, I'll try,

681
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,645
but why don't you give Von another chance?

682
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,215
That boy loves you.

683
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,251
I just don't know, something
wrong with this new guy.

684
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,019
Daddy, once you get to know him,

685
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,255
I know you're going to love him.

686
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,524
Trust me, okay?

687
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,126
Okay.

688
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,227
I'll try.

689
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,895
Thank you.

690
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,064
And I can't believe you
pulled a gun out on him.

691
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,266
Are you crazy?
Hell, yeah.

692
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,136
I only want the best for my baby girl.

693
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,972
Okay, Daddy, I
understand, but you gotta be

694
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,241
a little more nice.

695
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,143
Uh, uh, uh, only the best

696
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,879
and I'll go crazy if I have to.

697
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,381
I know you will.

698
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,985
I don't know what to do with you.

699
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,659
You come with me.

700
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,496
Sure, sir.

701
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,306
This is where you're gonna sleep.

702
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,041
Why does it look like this?

703
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,778
Well, usually that's my
brother-in-law, Rufus' doggie bed.

704
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,613
By the way, you're responsible

705
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,650
for walking him while you're here.

706
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,586
Mr. Givens, why does he think he's a dog?

707
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,622
About 20 years ago, Rufus went crazy.

708
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,857
He was cheating on his lady.

709
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,792
She was into all this voodoo shit,

710
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,427
but she put a root on him

711
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:34,131
and ever since them he's
been acting like a dog.

712
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,534
Oh, wow, that's crazy, man.

713
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,471
Look, my daughter tells
me you're a good man.

714
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,940
Yeah.

715
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,743
So I apologize for
everything I did earlier.

716
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,979
You know, Mr. Givens, that really means

717
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,815
a lot coming from you, man, thank you.

718
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,083
Don't worry about it.

719
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,419
Just get some rest and we got a long day

720
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,788
ahead of us tomorrow.

721
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,089
Yeah.

722
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,925
By the way, keep your goddamn hands

723
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,328
off my baby girl.

724
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,630
Yes, sir.

725
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,399
You have a good night, sir.

726
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,002
I will.

727
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,507
Oh, this isn't gonna work.

728
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,244
This isn't gonna work.

729
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,913
Just do what I have to do.

730
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,414
Get my wife

731
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,017
and get up outta here.

732
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,018
Shit.

733
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,075
Wake up.

734
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,812
Wake up, man.

735
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,382
What?

736
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,654
Be quiet before you wake Uncle Rufus up.

737
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,422
What the hell are you waking me up for?

738
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,490
You need to get dressed.

739
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,159
We gotta make a run.

740
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,627
This can't wait till in the morning,

741
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,229
I got jet lag.

742
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,133
Look, you wanna get in
good with my father, right?

743
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,035
Yeah, Lonze, I wanna
get in good with him.

744
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,403
Call me Lonze again and I'm a throw you

745
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,305
in the alley somewhere.

746
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,306
What?

747
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,307
Hurry up and get dressed

748
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,542
and make this run with me.

749
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,910
And hurry up.

750
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,246
We wastin' time.

751
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,650
Bring your nerd ass on.

752
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,791
Get your blind ass up and come on.

753
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,362
Don't wear them weak ass dress shoes again.

754
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:28,905
My nigga, my nigga.

755
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:29,841
Yo, what up?

756
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,007
What's happening nigga?

757
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,008
Ready to put this work in?

758
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,009
What's up little bitch?

759
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,245
Wait a minute, what's going on?

760
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,114
What is this guy doing here?

761
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,083
Like I said, we gotta make a run.

762
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,485
Yeah, but you said this was gonna get me

763
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,388
in on your dad's good side.

764
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,822
Be patient little man.

765
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,992
You a little uptight nigga, ain't you?

766
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,127
For Pete's sake, I wish you guys

767
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,429
would stop calling me a nigger.

768
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,632
It's not funny.

769
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,601
This Bama said for Pete's sake.

770
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,770
This nigga said nigger.

771
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,738
Man, we ain't in Mississippi.

772
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,707
We said nigga.

773
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,144
N-I-G-G-A, nigga.

774
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,645
What's wrong with this man.

775
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,781
Yo, I can tell my sister
ain't getting satisfied.

776
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,549
I can look at the look on her face.

777
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,018
That's a huge lie.

778
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,053
I'm satisfying your sister.

779
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,488
That's why you don't see her going back

780
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,656
to this chump.

781
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:23,593
Let me stop this motherfucker real quick.

782
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,729
You better not be fuckin' my sister.

783
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,797
I'm a take all the snacks

784
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,964

785
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,466
Slap his ass.

786
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,868
Just stop, you having

787
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,704
I, I, I, no, sir, I'm

788
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:35,739

789
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,674
Man, I ain't ask you about

790
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,944
no goddamn college courses and shit.

791
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,179
Do my dumb ass look like

792
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,847
I'm about to enroll in school?

793
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,116
I said is you fuckin' her?

794
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,084
No, no, I'm not, no.

795
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,519
Please.

796
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,754
This guy.

797
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,689
Let me find out you fuckin' her.

798
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,624
That's your ass little nigga.

799
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,167
Y'all wait.

800
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,069
You know what time it is.

801
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,304
Where are we?

802
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,774
Man, look, listen,
look, Trevor or Bradley

803
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,510
or whatever your name is,

804
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,345
I need you to go inside

805
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,115
and meet with this chick
to get this package.

806
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,517
You gotta enter in from the back.

807
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,187
Hoo, you gotta go in the back.

808
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,389
Huh!

809
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,790
He might like that.

810
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,059
I've gone in the back door before.

811
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,661
But, why can't you?

812
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,364
I don't go into places
where I'm not invited.

813
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,733
Man, I told you he wasn't black.

814
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:40,737
Man, you gonna get your ass in there.

815
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,507
Okay, okay, okay, man.

816
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,209
I'll go, but hopefully nothing screwy

817
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,345
is going on in there.

818
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,480
Get your dumb ass out the car,

819
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,583
marble head motherfucker.

820
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,752
You guys are crazy.

821
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,753
We know.

822
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,060
Oh, that nigga stupid.

823
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,396
I can't believe he fell for that shit.

824
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,131
Oh, just wait, when I'm finished

825
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,001
with this man, he gonna
be a nigga for real.

826
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,202
My sister ain't gonna want shit

827
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,771
to do with his ass.

828
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:19,576
Hey, honey, what you drinking?

829
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:24,414
I'll have me a glass of ice water please.

830
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,649
Look, if you gonna be in my bar,

831
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,285
you got to order a real drink.

832
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,786
Oh, well, in that case I'll have me

833
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,889

834
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,091
You want some Hennessy in that?

835
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,359
Some what?

836
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,994
Fuckin' lightweight.

837
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,029
What's up girl?

838
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,030
Hey.
You fine.

839
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,431
Thank you, usual?

840
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,533
Absolutely.

841
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,338
Hey, my main man.

842
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:49,807
I'm Preston.

843
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,818
So, uh, who invited you to the shindig?

844
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,824
Oh.

845
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,429
Nigga, why the fuck are we hiding?

846
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,265
Man, you see that big ass
vanilla gorilla over there?

847
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:19,603
That fuckin' redneck caught
me fuckin' both his girls.

848
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,305
You want a straw with
your Shirley Temple?

849
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,041
Yes, please, I would love it.

850
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,476
Yeah.

851
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,477
Ooh.

852
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,881
Nigga, goddamn.

853
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,950
You on your own man.

854
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,352
Whoa, what you doing, man?

855
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,353
You gonna go and leave me?

856
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,321
What the hell?

857
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,855
We bros, come on now.

858
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,626
He right over there with Preston.

859
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,494
Oh, man, nigga, you
might as well start digging

860
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,496
your grave, man.

861
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:50,667
Hey, handsome, you wanna buy me a drink?

862
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,135
Who you talking to, me?

863
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,972
Of course you, who else
would I be talking to?

864
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,307
All right.

865
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,642
I don't think I can buy you a drink.

866
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,343
My fiance wouldn't appreciate that.

867
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,145
Really.

868
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:01,979
Yeah.

869
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,179
That's too bad.

870
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,115
I was hoping you would buy me a drink

871
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,049
and take me to the bathroom.

872
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,850
Whoa, wait a minute, stop.

873
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,084
Are you sure?

874
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,120
Don't you do this to me, stop that.

875
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,457
No, no, stop, get off of me, lady, stop.

876
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,495
Damn, fat bastard in the fuckin' way.

877
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,697
Man, Von, you gotta go get that shit.

878
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,132
Nigga, why the fuck I gotta go get it?

879
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,333
That's your mans.

880
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,268
What's you mean.

881
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,102
Bruh, eat me or something.

882
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,405
That nigga see me, I'm dead.

883
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,673
I'll tell you what.

884
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,276
You go get it, I'll cause a distraction.

885
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,544
I ain't gonna forget that shit either.

886
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,379
That's fucked up, bruh.

887
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,213
All right, man.

888
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:38,081
It just might work.

889
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,482
All right.

890
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,018
Yeah, girl, I do security for the stars.

891
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,453
I be getting paid.

892
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,355
Oh, really?

893
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,824
So you wouldn't mind
buying me a drink then.

894
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,926
Nah, girl, I got you.

895
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,063
After that, let's hit up the bathroom.

896
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,299
Sounds good to me.

897
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,436
All right, shit.

898
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,871
Hey, bartender, give me some more

899
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,276
of that Rodney Cool shit, keep it coming.

900
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,044
Hey, you fat motherfucker,

00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,714

902
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,615

903
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,850
You heard me,

904
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,288
you big goofy pale Q-tip
looking motherfucker.

905
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,364
Man, I told you to give his ass the bag.

906
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,698
I'm not trying to get dicked down

907
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,133
from some fat motherfucker.

908
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,568
His black ass don't even like women.

909
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,336
I basically threw the pussy at him

910
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,772
and he act like he's scared.

911
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,273
Man, I gave you one damn job

912
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,909
and you couldn't get that shit right?

913
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,579
Wait till I tell my daddy.

914
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,148
Listen you Puerto Rican motherfucker.

915
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,351

00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,422

Oh, shit, man you still

00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,161

932
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,439
Damn, motherfucker.

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,341

Get the fuck off me, get the fuck off.

937
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,493
Damn.

938
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,162
It ain't over.

939
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,730
Yeah, I got your bag.

940
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,866
I bet you're gonna need this shit.

941
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,868
Fuck.

00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,511
Get the fuck off me man.

943
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,049
Remind me why I'm carrying
this motherfucker again.

944
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,785
Drunk off one goddamn
daiquiri, mother fuck.

945
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:32,857
Should have let the gay
nigga take him home, man.

946
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,093
Get the fuck off the bed.

947
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,337
Move this, fuck, fuck, come on nigga.

948
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,172
Get your ass to bed.

949
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,541
It stink in here.

950
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,916
Good morning, Ma.

951
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,951
Good morning, baby.

952
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,686
You need a hand?

953
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,788
Sure, I'll wash, you dry.

954
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:06,956
Okay, at least you gave me

955
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,058
the easy job.

956
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,296
So, what's on your mind?

957
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:17,500
Ma, is Daddy involved
in anything illegal?

958
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,701
No.

959
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,736
Your dad?

960
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,804
Absolutely not.

961
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,706
How can you afford this house?

962
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,210
This house is huge and you know we grew up

963
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,881
in that little three-bedroom
apartment so...

964
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,050
Look.

965
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,754
Your father has worked
for this all of his life.

966
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,556
This is the product of his hard work.

967
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,792
He wanted a place everyone could come to

968
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,528
and enjoy themselves.

969
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,097
Okay, I guess so.

970
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,567
But, Preston wants to marry me.

971
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:52,970
What?

972
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,270
Yes.

973
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,239
Oh, baby, when are you getting married?

974
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,808
I didn't exactly say yes to him.

975
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,109
Why not?

976
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,345
He seems like such a nice young man.

977
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,147
Because I made a promise to Daddy

978
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,715
that if I was to ever get married

979
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,650
that he would have to approve of the man.

980
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:11,988
Oh, Lord, you know how your
father is with those things.

981
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,724
So when is Preston planning to ask him?

982
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,025
I don't know, Ma.

983
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,461
Preston just trying to
win points with Daddy.

984
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,729
I think he's gonna ask him sometime

985
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,731
during Thanksgiving dinner.

986
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,768
Mm, well, we'll see how that works out.

987
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,472
Oh, Ma, you know you do
have a dishwasher, right?

988
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:32,642
And I know I wash dishes
better than the dishwasher.

989
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,777
Okay, Ma, I'm going get dressed.

990
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,778
All right, baby.

991
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,955
Hey, wake up boy.

992
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,658
We have a busy day ahead of us.

993
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,660
Oh, hey, beautiful.

994
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,894
How are you?

995
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,498
I'm good, but what the
hell happened to you?

996
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,968
You look like you been in a train wreck.

997
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,371
I just, my head is killing me.

998
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,740
I think I need an ibuprofen.

999
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,609
Oh, damn, you stink, too.

1000
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,779
What the hell you been doing?

1001
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,650
All right there young
fellow, rise and shine.

1002
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,953
I'm including you on our annual
Thanksgiving hunting trip.

1003
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,421
Hunting?

1004
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,591
Daddy, Preston doesn't believe
in the killing of animals.

1005
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,760
Don't believe in killing animals?

1006
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,095
How the hell this nigga eat then?

1007
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,997
Preston's a vegan.

1008
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,500
No, it's cool, it's cool.

1009
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,869
I don't mind going hunting.

1010
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,137
You don't?

1011
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,938
No, it'll be fun.

1012
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:36,973
Okay.

1013
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,107
Plus it'll give me a chance

1014
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,344
to bond more with your dad.

1015
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,614
Boy, what the hell happened to you?

1016
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,216
You look like shit.

1017
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,720
He smell like shit, too, but no, Daddy,

1018
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,522
he just had a hard time sleeping last night

1019
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,291
in there, that's all.

1020
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,494
All right, go wash
your ass and get dressed.

1021
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,531
Yeah, bye stinky.

1022
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,692
You did what?

1023
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,660
I didn't tell you to take him

1024
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,028
on a damn money pickup.

1025
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,131
Look, I needed an extra body.

1026
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,233
I could have pulled
that shit off by myself.

1027
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:41,204
Just give me my money and
get the hell outta my face.

1028
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,673
Yeah, about the money.

1029
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,909
This albino silver back
named Desmond got it.

1030
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,414
How the hell a silver back
named Desmond got my money?

1031
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,083
Preston fucked the whole thing up.

1032
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,153
You got 48 hours to give me my money.

1033
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,490
And I want every dime of it.

1034
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,726
How I'm supposed to get it in 48 hours?

1035
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,561
Motherfucker, I don't
care how you get it.

1036
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,430
Get the hell outta my face before I knock

1037
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,265
you into next week.

1038
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,267
But Dad, it was Preston.

1039
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,468
What?

1040
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,703
What's wrong?

1041
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,239
Madison, what in the
world is your dad into?

1042
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,074
My dad has a custodial business, why?

1043
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,108
What's going on?

1044
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,643
What custodian do you know

1045
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,044
that can afford a house like this?

1046
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,146
What are you trying to say?

1047
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,780
He doesn't do custodial work anymore.

1048
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,517
He owns the business.

1049
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,886
Madison, I'm sorry to break
to down to you like this,

1050
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,389
but I think your dad's a drug dealer.

1051
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,626
Wait, my dad, a drug dealer?

1052
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,627
No.

1053
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,496
I know you don't wanna believe me,

1054
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,264
but I'm dead serious.

1055
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,867
I overheard your dad and your
brother discussing a bad deal.

1056
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,769
Plus the way your brother was acting

1057
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,238
at the bar last night, it's crazy.

1058
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,908
The bar? What bar?

1059
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:52,776
What bar?

1060
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,110
Oh, here y'all are.

1061
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:54,945
Hey, Daddy.

1062
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:56,145
Let's go big man.

1063
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,114
Those rabbits not gonna shot themselves.

1064
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,550
Yes, sir, I'm ready to bust a cap

1065
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,454
right up their asses.

1066
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,925
I think I'm finally starting

1067
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,526
to get through to your dad.

1068
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,961
Yay!

1069
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,063
Good luck, babe, have fun hunting.

1070
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:14,898
I love you.

1071
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:15,898
I love you.

1072
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,140
All right, y'all it's time

1073
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:24,307
to get in these woods.

1074
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,441
I know we ain't taking this Nate Robinson

1075
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,643
chicken nugget looking motherfucker.

1076
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,078
Uncle Leroy.

1077
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,381
Wow, I see everyone's going, huh?

1078
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,651
How is he going and
Rufus thinks he's a dog?

1079
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:36,986
How the hell you go hunting

1080
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:37,987
without a good hunting dog?

1081
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,789
Yeah.

1082
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,891
We gotta be in the woods in two hours.

1083
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,261
Wait a minute, you're going, too.

1084
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,763
Hell, no, I got business to tend to.

1085
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,600
Business.
Business?

1086
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,270
Come on let's go, she
about to cheat on you anyway.

1087
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,805
What are you talking about.

1088
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,674
Man, get your ass on.

1089
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,340
That shit is crazy.

1090
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,642
Right?

1091
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,312
Oh, my God, I miss being home.

1092
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,515
Miss Madison might be
getting married soon.

1093
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,686
Oh, Ma, that was for your ears only.

1094
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,821
Oh, I'm happy for you.

1095
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,024
Just tell us, how good is he in bed?

1096
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,293
Ooh, girl, is he packing?

1097
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,029
Ooh, girl, everybody is packing compared

1098
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,897
to your husband, Aiesha, everyone.

1099
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,333
You leave my husband
out of this, Miranda,

1100
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,568
when your no dick getting bitter ass.

1101
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,871
What, girl, you the one that's backed up.

1102
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,506
You the one that got sex toys

1103
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,475
and dildoes all packed up in your purse.

1104
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,743
Remember that time you told me

1105
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:08,978
about your husband and how he bought

1106
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,248
that extension for his little dick?

1107
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,749
Remember that guy that told everybody

1108
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,487
on social media about your
genital warts, Vernon?

1109
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,389
Keep talking shit and your ass

00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,424
is gonna get fucked up.

1111
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,259
All you do is talk shit, Miranda.

1112
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,827
I guess you can't help but talk shit

1113
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,663
with breath like that.

1114
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,901
Girl, my breath don't stink.

1115
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,837
Smell my breath, smell it.

1116
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,840
Your breath smells
like Uncle Rufus' shit.

1117
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,041
My breath smell like-

1118
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,509
Your breath smell like Uncle Rufus' shit.

1119
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,578
Stop y'all.

1120
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,214
You know what, Miranda.

1121
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,883
You and your sister need
to run some errands for me.

1122
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:48,719
I don't wanna go with her,

1123
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,653
I wanna beat her ass.

1124
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,653
Where's Alonzo?

1125
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,788
Come on.

1126
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,890
Look, Miranda, I'm not gonna tolerate

1127
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,759
this mess in my house.

1128
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,429
Go with your sister and
clear your damn head.

1129
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,664
I'll fuck yo ass up later.

1130
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,999
You better not be here
when I get back bitch.

1131
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,669
Get out.

1132
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,641
Hey, man, what the hell's wrong with you?

1133
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,810
Oh, man, I gotta drop a load.

1134
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,046
I've been holding it a little bit.

1135
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,281
I think I sharted a little bit.

1136
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,816
You take your ass over
there behind that tree.

1137
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,551
Nobody tryna to be smelling your funky ass

1138
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,987
all the way home.

1139
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,224
Damn.

1140
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,726
Ol' crop dusting ass, smell like shit.

1141
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,928
You always got Mama trippin'.

1142
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,130
Whatever.

1143
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,065
You need to stop talking so much shit.

1144
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,165
Put your daggone seatbelt on.

1145
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,166
God.

1146
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,603
Oh, hell, no, he can't come.

1147
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,971
Oh, yes, he... Get out.

1148
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:42,972
Get out, Von.

1149
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,240
What you talking about?

1150
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,242
This is my car and I say who comes and goes

1151
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,977
and he can definitely come.

1152
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,145
Yeah.

1153
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,080
Damn, at least somebody appreciates me.

1154
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,650
I appreciate the hell out of you, baby.

1155
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,651
Oh, shit.

1156
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,155
Ooh.

1157
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,924
Shit.

1158
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,192
Oh.

1159
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,128
Damn, I told her about

1160
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,129
Oh!

1161
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,666
All right, yeah, you see that.

1162
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,769
Man, I just blasted the
shit out these rabbits.

1163
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,939
Wow, man, a human hunting dog, go figure.

1164
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,407
That's right.

1165
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,544
That's my secret weapon
right there, ain't you boy?

1166
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,545
Wow.

1167
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,148
Hey, man, you think I could do it?

1168
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,917
Man, I don't know.

1169
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,351
You don't look like no hunter.

1170
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,855
Man, come on, man,
just give me once chance.

1171
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,925
Man, all right, you got one shot.

1172
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,960
You better not miss either.

1173
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:38,961
Here, nerd.

1174
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,497
See what you got.

1175
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,132
Come on Rufus, you know what time it is.

1176
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,400
That a boy, Rufus.

1177
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,336
You're gonna go find Preston some rabbits.

1178
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,705
Come on, Rufus, let's go.

1179
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,576
Come on, Rufus, I know you can dig.

1180
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,986
I think he got something
for real this time.

1181
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,988
Hey, I think he got another one.

1182
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:06,989
Oh.

1183
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:08,924
Wait a minute.

1184
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,429
That a boy, Rufus.

1185
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,831
Why does Preston have a gun?

1186
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,300
Wait, ain't Mo back that.

00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,635

1193
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,209
That's Mo you stupid son of a bitch.

1194
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,211

00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,147
Ah!

Got me in my ass.

1198
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,118
Mr. Givens, I'm so sorry.

1199
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,520
I thought you were the rabbit.

1200
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,355
Man, do I look like a rabbit?

1201
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,892
I'm sorry man, get up.

1202
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,728
Motherfucker, you shot my brother

1203
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,430

1204
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,233
Goddamn, Mo, he blew a hole in your ass.

1205
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,569
I'm sorry, man,
I thought he was a rabbit.

1206
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,570
Fuck you.

1207
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,105
Hey Mo!
Hey!

1208
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,940

00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,008
Damn.

1210
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,176
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

1211
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,745
How the hell you shoot my daddy?

1212
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,013
You supposed to be shooting rabbits.

1213
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,247
Give me this gun you blind motherfucker.

1214
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,715
Man, I told you it was an accident.

1215
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,751
Maybe for the time you
was disabled Stevie Wonder.

1216
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:09,752
Ah!

1217
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,087

1218
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,556
Aw, man, please, man, I'm sorry, man,

00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,924
I'm sorry, man, please don't.

00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,926
Man, bend that little motherfucker over.

Toot it up.

00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,980
Hi, uh, may I help you?

1223
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,148
Good evening.

1224
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,649
We are Preston Mitchell's parents.

1225
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,718
Is this the Givens residence?

1226
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,786
Yes.

1227
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,355
Where is Preston?

1228
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,325
He went with the men hunting.

1229
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,793
They'll be back soon.

1230
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:51,794
Hunting?

1231
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,130
Since when does my son hunt?

1232
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:58,268
Please, come in, it's cold out there.

1233
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,407
How lovely.

1234
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,623
Hey, you got anymore of that drink.

1235
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,157
Yeah, why?

00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,392
Yo, come back here with me.

1237
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,662
Oh, you ain't got to tell me twice.

1238
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,098
I'm coming, baby.

1239
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:36,740
Here you go.

1240
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:40,643

00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,611
Oh, really.

00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,413
He don't know the real Madison.

1243
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,681
Oh, but...

Watch how she be.

1247
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,918
She is so sick of you though, honey.

1248
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,788
She is too good for this brown nigga.

1249
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,123
Yeah, I know.

1250
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,492

1252
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,695
I don't know though, baby.

1253
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,897
I mean, she is my sister.

1254
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,532
Yeah.

1255
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,202
Just can you do it for your man?

1256
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,406
Sure I can.

1257
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:11,841
Want some gum or something?

1258
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,876
Mm, no I don't need any.

1259
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,244
I insist.

1260
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,180
I mean if you insist.

1261
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,283
Oh, thank you.

1262
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:23,118
Babe, can you drive home?

1263
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,188
Yeah, I got you.
Okay.

00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,757
Rushing. Okay.

1265
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,560
You really think I can't drink this?

1266
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,696
No, we don't, that's
why we say drink more.

1267
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,963
I can drink this.
Well, then do it.

1268
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,800
Take it to the head.

1269
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,870
She can't do it, told you.

1270
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,106
I did drink it, Miranda.

1271
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,307
You had a little baby sip.

1272
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,742
Do not let your sister disrespect you

1273
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,177
like this, aight?

1274
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,311
Take it to the head, man.

1275
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,814
I took it to the head.

1276
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,483
She tryna dig you.

1277
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,885
That would never happen.

1278
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,054
Okay.
Ever.

1279
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,624
That ship has sailed and you know it.

1280
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,359
Okay, we gonna find out.

1281
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,329
We sure are not gonna find out.

1282
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,766
Please do come in.

1283
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,670
Hannah, you are so sweet

1284
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,473
and I love what you've done with your home.

1285
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,108
Oh, thank you, Rene, I can't wait

1286
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,778
for my husband to meet you both.

1287
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,582
Anyway, how was your trip here?

1288
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,150
Oh, it was lovely.

1289
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,720
The weather was just magnificent.

1290
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,489
Excuse me?

1291
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,824
When are they expected to be back?

1292
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,426
Oh, dear.

1293
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,495
They should be back.

1294
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,929
You know what?

1295
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,731
They should have been back by now.

1296
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,233
Maybe that's them.

1297
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,535
Excuse me.

1298
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,406
Dear, they have such a lovely home.

1299
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,510
Value city.
Oh, dear.

1300
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,048
Oh, hi, Jenny.

1301
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,483
What brings you by?

1302
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,951
I was actually looking for Mr. Givens.

1303
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,720
I have some documents for him to sign.

1304
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,755
He has not been answering his phone.

1305
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,423
Oh, he's out hunting with the fellows.

1306
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,825
They should be back soon.

1307
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,194
Why don't you come in and wait for them.

1308
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,462
Make yourself at home.

1309
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,365
Okay, thanks, Mrs. G.

1310
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,137
Stan, Rene.

1311
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,473
This is Jenny, my husband
Maurice's accountant

1312
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,275
and a family friend.

1313
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,177
Hi, nice to meet you.

1314
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,646
Oh, you are gorgeous.
Thank you.

1315

1334
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:11,587
Delightful.

1335
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,490
Yes, she is delightful.

1336
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,493
Mm, I miss you, baby.

1337
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,198
Shit.

1338
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,002
How come you don't
never come and visit me?

1339
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,904
Girl, you told me go to hell.

1340
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,072
You told me you hated me.

1341
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,774
Nu-uh, I love you, baby.

1342
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:35,111
Dammit, I'm like all hard.

1343
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,514
Remember, remember, remember that time

1344
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:40,850
we made a movie.

1345
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,520
Hell, yeah, I still got it, too.

1346
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:47,789
I wanna.

1347
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,225
I wanna make another movie.

1348
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,060
Ew.

1349
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,094
Dammit, so close.

1350
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:52,929
Oh, yeah.

1351
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:53,763
What?

1352
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,264
Ooh, woo!

1353
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,899
Man.

1354
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,635
Your sister back there man, fuck.

1355
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,871
That's some good shit, mm.

1356
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,307
You know what, babe.

1357
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,042
Let's do it right now.

1358
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,076
Let's not.

1359
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,846
Right now in the back seat.

1360
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:11,847
I'm gonna get your-

1361
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,215
Come on.

1362
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,549
Man, your sister back there.

1363
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,385
Uh-huh.

1364
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,219
We gotta wait.

1365
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,053
Yeah, I'm back here.

1366
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,820
Nuh-uh, fuck you, ho

1367
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,222
and your cobweb lined pussy.

1368
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,990
This is my motherfuckin' car.

1369
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,192
Y'all ain't fuckin' back here.

1370
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:27,529
Her breath is dick deterrent.

1371
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,830
That's fucked up.

1372
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:31,768
That's right, I said it, blocker.

1373
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,337
Pull this damn car over.

1374
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,505
Pull the car over.

1375
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,106
That's why you don't got no dick now.

1376
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,107
I don't know,

1377
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,108
I ain't pulling this car over,

1378
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,243
it's cold as shit outside, girl.

1379
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,711
Von, make her ass walk home.

1380
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:43,745
Oh shit, what?

1381
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,881
I ain't walking nowhere.

1382
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,550
I'm walking right into him.

1383
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,553
Goddamn right you are.

1384
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,490
Oh, boy, just you wait, ooh,

1385
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,128
I got something special for you.

1386
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,700
Don't be a hater, Miranda.

1387
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:09,871
If you huh, could use a
mint, you could get a man.

1388
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,540
That's fucked up.

1389
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,541
Shut up.

1390
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,045
And don't mind her.

1391
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,948
She don't get out much.

1392
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,050
What you tryna do, girl.

1393
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,152
Oh, don't you worry,

1394
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,854
you gonna wait and see.

1395
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,856
Pop up with that vest on, girl,

1396
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,726
furry as a motherfucker.

1397
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,363
Scratch you all up.

1398
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,364
Scratch me up.

1399
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,199
Ooh.

1400
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,034
I'm still back here.

1401
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:40,369
And?

1402
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,371
What's that supposed to mean?

1403
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,905
You got somewhere to go?

1404
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:47,310
You got a date?

1405
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,178
No.

1406
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,715
We know the answer to that one, don't we.

1407
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:57,553
Man, Peewee Sherman just shot my brother.

1408
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,994
I told you I'm sorry.

1409
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,363
Who the hell raised this
asshole in the first place?

1410
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,832
Hold on, Mo, it's gonna be all right.

1411
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,833
Shh, shh.

1412
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,240
Girl, you wear your hot-

1413
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,742
See, look at you.

1414
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:23,345
Get in the damn house.

1415
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,449
Don't goddamn rush things, shut up.

1416
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,488
This fool dyin' man,
what's wrong with you.

1417
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:34,656
Can't see shit.

1418
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,025
Oh, my God, Maurice, what happened?

1419
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,493
Are you okay?

1420
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,862
This nigga done shot daddy
right up his ass cheek.

1421
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:41,798
Preston!

1422
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:42,998
What on earth is going on?

1423
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,434
Mom and Dad, what are
you guys doing here?

1424
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,769
Who are these misfits
you're associating with?

1425
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,304
What the hell is a mick rit?

1426
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,539
And this whore?

1427
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,809
Stanley, apologize to these people.

1428
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,210
These people.

1429
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,713
Aw, hell no, go to the car and get my shit.

1430
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:01,550
I don't know who the fuck
Kamala, Oprah, Obama thinks

1431
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,018
he's talking to.

1432
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,120
No, sir, you will not
speak to my wife like that.

1433
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,822
Do not let this suit fool you.

1434
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,356
I will whoop your ass.

1435
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:13,195
Aw, shit, I got three to
one on this black cracker.

1436
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,030
No!

1437
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:15,263
Stanley.

1438
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,566
These hands do more than sign contracts.

1439
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,434
Leroy, that goes for you, too.

1440
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,803
Shit, it's cool, 'cause
it ain't gonna be no fight.

1441
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,505
It's about to be one-sided
than a motherfucker.

1442
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,707
I'm a whoop bougie Daisy-Bell ass.

1443
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,075
Oh, say lesser.

1444
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,344
Well, bring your ass, nigga, let's go.

1445
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,512
Dad, no, no, no.

1446
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,833
No, I'll do more, I'll do more.

1447
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,819
Grab my coat.

1448
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,989
Y'all just gonna leave me
laying here on the floor.

1449
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,491
Hannah!

1450
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:43,658
Hannah!

1451
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:46,162
Bruh, beat this nigga's ass.

1452
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,663
Stanley, let's go.

1453
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:49,499
No.

1454
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,366
I'm ready to leave.

1455
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,200
Why?

1456
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,234
Fine, I'm leaving.

1457
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,202
I'm going... Mom, no.

1458
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,170
No, I'm tired of it.

1459
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,506
Oh, my God, what is going on?

1460
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,474
Dad, please, no.

1461
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:00,942
You can't do this.

1462
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,378
Nobody, I mean nobody's
associates with me like this.

1463
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,847
Dad, it's your death wish.

1464
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:09,084
You lose, and you walking home.

1465
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,485
Shit, I ain't losing shit

1466
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,755
to a motherfucker with
a Steve Harvey mustache.

1467
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,224
Fake ass Marvin Hagler.

1468
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,592
All right, all right,

1469
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,228
we got these two in here tryna fight.

1470
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,564
Let's get it on.

1471
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,700
Whoever lose get to corner
my ass to the ground.

1472
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:29,038
Both of y'all get your
asses over here, let's go.

1473
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,977
Oh, shit.

1474
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:46,988
Long time.

1475
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:47,990
Ooh, baby.

1476
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,359
You the best.

1477
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,063
Come on, take me.

1478
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,133
Girl, you ain't got to
tell me twice, goddamn it.

1479
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,936
Girl, I'm a tear your ass up in here, girl.

1480
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,905
I'm about to beat the pants off that thing.

1481
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,140
You better beat it up.

1482
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,676
Every night once we get married, boo.

1483
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,710
That's right, girl.

1484
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:09,512
Let me warm up right quick.

1485
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,946
Okay.

1486
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,281
Girl, I'm about to
beat your pussy up, girl,

1487
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:17,220
beat the pussy, beat the
pussy, beat the pussy.

1488
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:24,527
I'm about to give you that
strong, strong ass iron, girl.

1489
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,462
Baby.

1490
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:29,731
Baby.

1491
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:32,734
Man, fuck.

1492
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,771
I was this close.

1493
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,676
Come on awake, girl, come on, wake up.

1494
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:45,147
My dick all heavy, shit.

1495
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:53,922
Oh, shit!

1496
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,861
Let's go Leroy, he's down, he's down.

1497
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,697
Oh, somebody call an ambulance.

1498
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:05,268
Somebody call an ambulance, oh!

1499
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,256
Dad, wake up.

1500
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,525
I told you not to come down here to fight.

1501
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,094
This is ridiculous.

1502
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,099
Hey, Miranda, have you seen Madison?

1503
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,568
I thought you two were together.

1504
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,737
Oh, she was with me.

1505
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:44,172
Here and that Von have been spending

1506
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:45,674
a lot of time together.

1507
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,009
I don't know, Preston.

1508
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,511
Oh, okay.

1509
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:50,512
Thanks.

1510
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,076
Oh, honey, I am so sorry you had

1511
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,445
to find out this way.

1512
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,782
My sister really is an inconsiderate ho.

1513
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,052
Hey, any more of these
uppity mofos up in here

1514
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,288
that sacked Daddy in the ass going hunting.

1515
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,622
Rufus, get off him.

1516
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,857
Fuck that.

1517
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:36,792
I ain't staying in the same house

1518
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,960
as this old uppity ass nigga.

1519
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:39,795
Tell him, Mo.

1520
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,029
Listen here.

1521
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,698
I am just as black as any man here.

1522
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,800
I cannot help, get back from me, man.

1523
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,736
I cannot help that I can actually read

1524
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,473
above a third grade level, Mr. Pork Chop.

1525
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:54,209
Motherfucker, read these.

1526
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,710
There's plenty of room for everyone

1527
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:58,847
and I don't wanna hear
nothing else about it.

1528
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,715
Let him say something else to me.

1529
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,450
You think Leroy whooped you,

1530
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,586
I'm about to beat that motherfuckin' ass.

1531
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,020
Stop!

1532
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:07,255
Enough!

1533
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:11,192
This is my house and I
say who comes and goes.

1534
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,727
That goes for you too, Jenny.

1535
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,062
You're staying.

1536
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,330
It's late.

1537
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,899
No one's going anywhere,
there's plenty of room.

1538
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,069
Wait a minute, she's staying here?

1539
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,337
Huh.

1540
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,706
Chop gonna stay put exactly where he is.

1541
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,241
Damn!

1542
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,209
Thank you, Ma.

1543
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,311
You the best.

1544
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,081

1547
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:43,225

01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:53,903

01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,719

Oh, I'm comin', Jenny.

1565
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,439
I made a special trip for you, baby.

1566
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,676
Lord, look at them mule muffins.

1567
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,277
Goddamn, girl.

1568
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,213
I knew my brother was hittin' that.

1569
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,380
It's not what you think?

1570
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,883
I was just checking on Mr. G.

1571
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,052
Like hell you were.

1572
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,854
Look, girl, you better give me something

1573
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,123
before I go on and tell my sister

1574
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:30,960
about what's going on.

1575
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:34,897
Look, I'll give you one dance.

1576
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,031
Shit.

1577
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,401
You can nothing but a word.

1578
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,971
Come on over here and
make it do what it do.

1579
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:43,972
Ooh, wee!

1580
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,375
Yeah.

1581
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:49,844
Oh!

1582
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,346
Get up in there.

1583
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,514
Slow down, girl.

1584
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,949
Oh, shit.

1585
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,184
Ah!

1586
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,185
Ah!

1587
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,220
Ah!

1588
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,595
Jesus.

1589
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:10,565
All right.

1590
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,640
Beta-Luther, Meta-Luther, who was better?

1591
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,485
Well, what the hell is going on here?

1592
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,420
Oh, it's not what you think.

1593
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,855
I was just checking on Mr. Pork Chop,

1594
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:35,757
he doesn't seem to feel well.

1595
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:38,459
Listen, maybe you can give me

1596
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,730
a little bit of that
attention if you don't mind.

1597
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,733
You know that I'm still-

1598
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,738
You fuck me again, legs.

1599
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,175
What's up, girl?

1600
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,711
That ass fat as shit.

1601
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:59,782
I'm trying a horse bit in that thing.

1602
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,385
Oh, man, I been tryna

You ever let him in?

1606
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,062
Uh-uh.

1607
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,198
Well, let me tell you something.

1608
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,534
That nigga use a fake ass dick.

He bought this shit
called a penis extender.

1610
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:26,642
I heard my mother telling
my aunt about that shit.

1611
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,312
Boy, you about to get fucked up.

1612
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,548
Daddy, you fuckin' Jenny.

1613
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,516
Wait till I tell Mom.

1614
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,953
Nah, I'm not having
sex with that young girl.

1615
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,755
Well, she give me head sometime,

1616
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,790

1617
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,759
You a dirty old man, Daddy.

1618
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,394
You got that fine girl licking

1619
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,563

1620
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,766
Well, you better not tell
your mother about none of it.

1621
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,067
Hell, no.

1622

1624
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,676
You better focus on giving me my money.

1625
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,277
If you don't get my money by tomorrow,

1626
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:05,480
it's gonna be hell to pay.

1627
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,249
Shit, get in the bed.

1628
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,191
Hey.

1629
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:21,028
This could be between me and you, baby.

1630
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,432
My wife doesn't need to know.

1631
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,270
I don't want her to, anything.

1632
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,176
It's our first scene.

1633
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,177
Come here.

1634
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,246
Fuck, come here, girl.

1635
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,214
Wait a minute.

1636
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,716
What the hell?

1637
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:42,850

1645
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,431
Listen, I was merely trying

1646
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,132
to check on the young lady

1647
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,201
and make sure that she was okay, no sex.

1648
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,969
You old nasty nigga.

1649
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,371
Youse a goddamn liar, that's bullshit.

01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,206
And I'm a tell your wife you in here trying

Look.

1653
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,945
What are you doing
hitting my son like that?

1654
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,213
He deserved it.

1655
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,948
He's a freak, that's
what he is, a pervert.

1656
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,118
Coming up and touching on our asses.

1657
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,723
What in the world is going on in here?

1658
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,793
Hey, Ma, I can explain everything.

1659
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,829
Yeah, I wanna hear this.

1660
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,299
You see, uh, what happened was, uh,

1661
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,369
that girl Jenny, she said she saw a mouse.

1662
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,571
A mouse?

1663
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:38,206
A rodent, yes, a rodent.

1664
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,374
So, so, and big ass teeth.

1665
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,610
I, I got Daddy-

1666
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,078
Yeah, I came to help.

And Mr. Mitchell-

1668
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,950
Yes, he enlisted my services, yes.

1669
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,953
To help me find that big ass teeth mouse.

1670
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,921
Well, look, I got a house full of people.

1671
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,057
I need you to call the
exterminator first thing

01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,725

1673
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,261
Oh, okay, no problem, baby.

1674
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,762
Looks like you're feeling better.

1675
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,265
Come on, let's go to bed.

1676
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,068

1684
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,250
from hitting that shit either, Daddy.

1685
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:23,517
I don't owe you nothing.

1686
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:24,552
Get outta my face.

1687
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,454
A thousand dollars, my man?

1688
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:27,788
Mere chump change.

1689
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:30,258
I bid you both ado and goodnight.

1690
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,492
What?

1691
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:34,863
If he snitch, bury his ass in the backyard.

1692
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,033
Preston.

1693
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,301
Morning, baby.

1694
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:43,237
Von, ooh, what is you doing in my bed?

1695
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:46,007
Come on, girl, you
don't remember last night?

1696
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,241
We back together again.

1697
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:48,809
I don't remember anything last night.

1698
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:52,046
Hell, man, look, girl,
stop being so modest, man.

1699
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,181
All that freaky shit you did to me.

1700
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,816
Girl, my toes still hurt from curling

1701
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,084
them shit so much.

1702
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,520
Ugh, no, get up and get out.

1703
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,489
I don't care, whatever happened last night

1704
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,190
was a mistake.

1705
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,759
Get out now.

1706
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,027
Okay, all right.

1707
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,395
Get your shit, get your little Jordans.

1708
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,763
All right, let's see how Preston feel

1709
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:09,764
when I tell him.

1710
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:10,998
Uh-uh, you can't tell him.

1711
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,200
No, please, do not tell him.

1712
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,735
I could never hurt him like that.

1713
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,071
Okay, I'll tell you what.

1714
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:21,009
Break up with him or I'm
a tell him everything.

1715
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,779
Fine.

1716
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,813
I'll call it off,

1717
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,050
but you can never tell him.

1718
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,218
Look.

1719
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,788
Get out.

1720
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:42,757
What the hell you laughing at?

1721
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,892
What? I am happy.

1722
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:47,028
Everybody's here, we got
the whole family here, okay.

1723
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,764
It's almost Thanksgiving,
I'm in a good mood.

1724
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:52,033
You know damn well,
doo-doo butt breath lying

1725
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,367
like damn shit.

1726
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,036
You know damn well you can't stand us.

1727
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:58,140
Please, I am in the holiday spirit.

1728
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:00,808
My ass.

1729
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,644
Good morning, Leroy.

1730
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,249
Patti LaBelle, Dionne Warwick,

1731
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,084
Laura from "Family Matters."

1732
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,619
Don't none of y'all get your damn eyelashes

1733
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,021
in my food, okay.

1734
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,490
Where the hell them Mitchells at?

1735
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:17,925
Oh, I see they ain't want nothing

1736
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,927
after that ass whippin' last night, huh?

1737
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,195
Hey, so Uncle Leroy,

1738
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,630
so what's up with that Thanksgiving day

1739
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,131
football game this year?

1740
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,200
Hey, man, shut up, you
ain't even on my team, man.

1741
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,135
What?

1742
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:28,602
Everybody know I always whip

1743
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:29,271

lookin' motherfucker's

1744
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:30,805
team every year.

1745
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:33,174
It ain't gonna be nothing but
holiday tradition up in here.

1746
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:34,909
I'm a hit him with the walk.

1747
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,910
This guy.

1748
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,280
Leroy, you know Maurice
is in no condition

1749
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,448
to play this game.

1750
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,783
He just got shot yesterday.

1751
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:43,718
Hold up.

1752
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,453
I didn't say I wasn't playing.

1753
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,155
Come tomorrow, my team
is gonna beat your ass.

1754
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,558
Maurice, you need to go to the doctor

1755
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,726
and get your butt cheeks checked.

1756
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:54,495
Oh, I'm all right, Hannah.

1757
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:56,730
But I got something for his cheatin' ass.

1758
01:18:56,731 --> 01:18:57,899
Yeah, Daddy.

1759
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:00,735
What's up, bruh?

1760
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,036
Old bootleg Carlton Banks looking.

1761
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,270
What's wrong with you, bruh?

1762
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,339
Somebody steal your bow tie or something.

1763
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,642
I bet he know where
the end of the rainbow is

1764
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,679
and damn pot of gold.

1765
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,482
Don't you be touching me.

1766
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,650
Get the hell off of me, man.

1767
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:18,319
♪ Magically delicious

1768
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,055
I'm sick of you guys.

1769
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,057
Hey, wait!

1770
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,093
Goddamn it.

1771
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,396
You forgot your hat and my fuckin' wish.

1772
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:31,333
Hey, leave him alone.

1773
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,236
Babe, wait.

1774
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,707
Madison, how could you
cheat on me with Von?

1775
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,609
How do you know?

1776
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,676
Who told you?

1777
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,178
Your sister told me

1778
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:45,513
and it was confirmed once I seen both

1779
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:48,249
of you all laid up in the bed together.

1780
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,650
I'm sorry, babe.

1781
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,485
I swear, I don't remember what happened.

1782
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,220
The last thing I know is driving

1783
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:54,722
on the way home and that's it.

1784
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,924
And you think I'm
supposed to believe that?

1785
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:57,992
Well, I don't.

1786
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,426
But you know what?

1787
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:02,029
I don't even care, 'cause
we can call it even.

1788
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,798
Your sister, she showed me
a great time last night.

1789
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:06,634
You slept with Miranda?

1790
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,635
Really, Preston?

1791
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,370
I can't believe you.

1792
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:10,972
Well, believe it.

1793
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,509
I'm done with you.

1794
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:31,259
I can't believe my
sister would do this to me.

1795
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,002
Look, everything needs
to seem normal around here.

1796
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,138
I don't want your mother finding out.

1797
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,106
I need you to get my money.

1798
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,441
If we don't get that money back,

1799
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:50,177
it's gonna be hell to pay.

1800
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,647
I can't do that shit myself.

1801
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:55,716
It's Preston's fault.

1802
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:57,952
Make his ass do it.

1803
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,621
Okay, you get him and Von,

1804
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:03,757
but don't back here till you got my money.

1805
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,160
All right, Dad.

1806
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,497
Hello?

1807
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:11,966

Hey, wait a damn minute.

2017
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:35,909
That way he can't come after us again.

Yo, bitch, I saw you fuck

2039
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,037
How her mouth taste?

2040
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,706
Fuckin' whore, she fuckin'

2041
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,142

Get the fuck off me, nigga.

2044
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:46,580
There go the police, motherfucker.

2045
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,116
You about to get your
fuckin' ass locked up.

2046
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:50,517
Oh, shit.

2047
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,618
A 40, I'll try to get the three,

2048
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,353
a bunch of females.

2049
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:54,956
Roger.

2050
01:29:56,391 --> 01:30:00,193
This is the police, get your hands up.

2051
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,795
Black lives matter, motherfucker.

2052
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:03,830
Take it all back to
the sound of my voice.

2053
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,065
I don't fucked you up.

2054
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,533
I told you I was gonna
beat your ass, bitch.

2055
01:30:06,534 --> 01:30:09,636
70140 Rogers, 7851 a family dispute.

2056
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:11,472
4972 West 21st Street.

2057
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:19,781
Tell me again, how am I missing $150,000?

2058
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,015
Explain that shit.

2059
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,950
We took that sell-out Preston

2060
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,185
and he took all the money

2061
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,421
and spent it on gambling
and hos at the casino

2062
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,790
and I mean he was spending
it on bad bitches, too.

2063
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,892
Man, they make Jenny
look like Whoopi Goldberg

2064
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,360
with doo-doo flats.

2065
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:35,829
Yeah, yeah, Dad, but I
seen him with the flats.

2066
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:36,830
Yes.

2067
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:41,768
Broke finger and all that shit.

2068
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,803
Don't you touch me.

2069
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:43,938
And then...

2070
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,679
This is unbelievable Preston.

2071
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,881
I can't believe this.

2072
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:56,416
Preston, have I not taught you anything.

2073
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:58,251
Do you not know who we are these days?

2074
01:30:58,252 --> 01:30:59,453
Me and your mother.

2075
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,955
You ain't no ordinary Negro, Preston.

2076
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:02,890
I'm tired of this.

2077
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:03,891
Oh, baby, are you okay?

2078
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:04,792
What was he thinking?

2079
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:05,760
I have no clue.

2080
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:06,960
Yeah.

2081
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,629
Baby, I have a terrible hangover.

2082
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,332
I'll make you some tea and soup, okay.

2083
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,634
Yeah, I'm never drinking again.

2084
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,969
Please do not, son.

2085
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,337
You know how you get with a little bit

2086
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:18,738
of alcohol in your system.

2087
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,074
Why would you get pissy drunk like this?

2088
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,810
Mom and Dad, could you please excuse me?

2089
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:25,645
I need a word with Madison.

2090
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,081
Fine, let's go, honey.

2091
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,851
Please.
I'm sorry.

2092
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:32,719
Babe.

2093
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:36,857
Listen, baby, I don't care what happened.

2094
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:39,793
I realized I can't live without you.

2095
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,628
I can't live without you, either.

2096
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:43,663
The motherfucker stopped
pointing the gun and shit,

2097
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:46,567
start pistol whipping me like this.

2098
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:49,870
Is that why you look like shit?

2099
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:51,338
I gave you the task of handling

2100
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,206
this transaction Alonzo.

2101
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,242
But this Joe wants his money.

2102
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:57,143
We all gonna be dead.

2103
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:59,412
Damn, Daddy, don't you
got some money stashed away?

2104
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:01,348
I mean, how you let this shit happen?

2105
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,383
I don't have enough
funds to liquidate it.

2106
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:07,187
By the time I get it,
it's gonna be too late.

2107
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,588
What you gonna tell Ma?

2108
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,056
I ain't gonna tell her shit

2109
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,458
and you better not either.

2110
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,628
I'll figure something out.

2111
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:18,865
Please forgive me for everything I did.

2112
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,901
Please forgive me for my behavior.

2113
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:21,902
I do.

2114
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,505
Yeah, but there's only one more thing.

2115
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:27,841
What's that, baby?

2116
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:29,743
I got to talk to your dad.

2117
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:30,877
Yeah.

2118
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:31,878
I love you.

2119
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:32,980
I love you.

2120
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:35,483
Let's go.

2121
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:36,483
Okay.

2122
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,192
I'm gonna whoop your motherfuckin-

2123
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:49,396
Get off me, let me go, let me go.

2124
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,965
Good God, you will not touch one hair

2125
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,833
upon my son's head.

2126
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:56,236
Your son owes me $150,000.

2127
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,671
I want my shit now.

2128
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,806
How the hell he owe you Daddy?

2129
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:01,241
Stay out of it baby girl.

2130
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,410
Stay away from that
lyin', cheatin' bastard.

2131
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:04,811
Cheatin'.

2132
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,913
He owes me $150,000.

2133
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,782
He spent it on them hos and gambling.

2134
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:10,283
No, wait, wait, wait, a minute,

2135
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,185
what are you talking about, sir?

2136
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,321
You stole my money.

2137
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:15,555
Alonzo, get my shit.

2138
01:33:15,556 --> 01:33:16,723
Aw shit!

2139
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:19,859
Wait, wait, wait, dammit, wait!

2140
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,761
This doesn't make any sense.

2141
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,430
Preston doesn't need to steal.

2142
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:24,631
Yeah.

2143
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:25,566
That nigga ain't need to cheat neither,

2144
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:26,233
but he did that shit, too.

2145
01:33:26,234 --> 01:33:27,467
Come on.

2146
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:29,002
Preston wouldn't cheat on Madison.

2147
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:29,904
I would never Oh, really?

2148
01:33:29,905 --> 01:33:30,905
What?

2149
01:33:30,906 --> 01:33:33,139
Okay, I bet you 10,000 he did.

2150
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,008
And I got proof.

2151
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,977
Look, my son, I will take that bet, sir.

2152
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:38,178
You'll take that bet, sir?

2153
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,846
All right, well, let's have a look then.

2154
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:41,015
Let's see, mm.

2155
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,517
What is he talking about.

2156
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:45,618
Let's see the proof.

2157
01:33:45,619 --> 01:33:46,753
Let's see the proof Von.

2158
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:47,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2159
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:48,756
That's you, goddamn it Jerry Springer.

2160
01:33:48,757 --> 01:33:50,458
You fuckin' Miranda.

2161
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,260
Ease up, ease up, Daddy.

2162
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:55,595
It's just Miranda's ass.

2163
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:57,564
Everybody done hit that, here.

2164
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,766
Aw, shit.
Oh, my God.

2165
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:01,234
Wait a minute.

2166
01:34:01,235 --> 01:34:04,437
You and your family get
the fuck out my house.

2167
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:06,206
Pack your shit up.

2168
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:08,541
Listen, I don't have to put up

2169
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:10,844
with this anymore, I'm out.

2170
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:11,878
Come on, Preston,

2171
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,146
let's go pack your things.

2172
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,614
We can see where we're not welcome.

2173
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:16,516
You'll not be seeing us again.

2174
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:17,984
You uncivilized fucking children.

2175
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,219
Daddy, what you doing?

2176
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:22,022
It's ridiculous, I'm leaving, too.

2177
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:23,590
If he wanted to make a wish come true

2178
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,825
he'd have gave us
continue to knock him out.

2179
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:26,660
Come on, y'all, let's
get ready for this game.

2180
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,495
Stop, Von.

2181
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:28,628
Let me see your phone.

2182
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:29,829
Dang.

2183
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,297
How the hell we gonna play this game

2184
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:32,832
we got these monster Bamas
looking for you, Dad?

2185
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,300
Look, it's Thanksgiving.

2186
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:37,738
They ain't doing nothing on Thanksgiving.

2187
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:42,876
Hey, baby.

2188
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,677
I'm gonna pack my bag, too.

2189
01:34:44,678 --> 01:34:46,479
No, you stay here.

2190
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,647
I don't want you to have any more tension

2191
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:48,882
with your family.

2192
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:51,618
Baby, I don't care about any of that.

2193
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:52,553
I just want you.

2194
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:53,487
Get the hell off of me.

2195
01:34:53,488 --> 01:34:55,288
Look, it's for the best.

2196
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,290
We need some space, Madison.

2197
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,324
Preston.

2198
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:00,694
Madison, I said it's over.

2199
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,762
I shamed both of our families,

2200
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:03,997
can't you see that.

2201
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,198
Just let me go.

2202
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,834
Whatever, I am gonna clear my head

2203
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,771
and I suggest that you do the same.

2204
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,609
I'm not doing anything.

2205
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:25,919
Daddy!

2206
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,920
No!

2207
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,692
Boy, if you playing quarterback,

2208
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:33,893
let me tell you right now.

2209
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:35,028
I'm be like Deon Sanders.

2210
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:37,431
I'm talking about prime time.

2211
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:42,936
Leroy, you ready to get your ass whooped?

2212
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:44,838
Man, shut up Dirk Fisher.

2213
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,306
Got your son over here dressed like

2214
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:47,907
and African bottle of Sunny Delight.

2215
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,142
Let's do this shit.

2216
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,977
Oh, shit, let's do that.

2217
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:52,779
We about to whoop on Lamont Sanford.

2218
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,848
Junkyard ass.

2219
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:56,716
Negro, please, I'm 'bout to put

2220
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,219
your ass to sleep.

2221
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,421
Plain and simple.

2222
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:02,356
Baby girl.

2223
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:03,324
Daddy, please!

2224
01:36:03,325 --> 01:36:04,491
Hey, what's wrong.

2225
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:05,992
These men said they're gonna kill me

2226
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:08,428
unless you pay them their money.

2227
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:11,931
Mr. Givens, you did not keep your word.

2228
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:14,367
You told me I would have my money.

2229
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:17,537
Now I'm gonna show you how I keep my word.

2230
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,072
If I don't get my money,

2231
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,073
I'm gonna make sure I send

2232
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:22,175
your daughter back in pieces.

2233
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,577
Bring the money to Iverson Mall in an hour.

2234
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:26,413
No police or she dies.

2235
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,983
Daddy, please.

2236
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:31,484
Madison!

2237
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:34,254
Maurice, what are they talking about?

2238
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:37,190
Why do these people have our daughter?

2239
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:38,892
I'll tell you why?

2240
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:40,393
Huh.

2241
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:42,829
It comes from all of his drug dealing.

2242
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,097
How else do you think he's able

2243
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:47,433
to afford this big old fancy house.

2244
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:48,434
What?

2245
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:49,869
Drug dealing?

2246
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:53,706
Maurice, what in the
hell is he talking about?

2247
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:55,742
So this is all your fault?

2248
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:57,710
What else haven't you told me?

2249
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,646
No, it's his fault.

2250
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:01,414
He gambled all our money away.

2251
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:03,283
That's bullshit.

2252
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:06,620
Your son and Von lost all of your money.

2253
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:11,524
None of this is important right now.

2254
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:14,260
We all have to work together
to get Madison back.

2255
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:18,998
Let's just put our
differences aside and think.

2256
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:21,734
Where are they holding her, Maurice?

2257
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:23,203
Well, I know where they're holding her,

2258
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:25,038
but the problem is how am I gonna get

2259
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,473
$150,000 in cash.

2260
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:28,441
Hold up.

2261
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,443
Yeah.

2262
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:32,145
You have the money?

2263
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,514
Chop got 20 on him.

2264
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:36,082
Ain't got time for your jokes right now.

2265
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,350
Listen, everyone focus.

2266
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,886
How much money do we have, honestly?

2267
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:42,355
Well, I got a little
over $150,000 in the bag

2268
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:43,857
plus some jewelry.

2269
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,761
Here, take these.

2270
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:51,331
None of this material stuff is important.

2271
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:53,032
I just want my baby back.

2272
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:55,602
I want her back, too.

2273
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:58,005
Would you calm down.

2274
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,974
Let me see.

2275
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:01,975
Oh, okay.

2276
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:05,512
Put something in it, dweeb.

2277
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:07,680
Dad, I love her.

2278
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,416
Alonzo, can you go downtown

2279
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:13,786
and see if you can get all this finished.

2280
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:17,257
Yes, sir, I got you, Daddy, okay.

2281
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:18,424
Need her back now.

2282
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:21,028
We're gonna get her back son.

2283
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:47,020
Mr. Givens.

2284
01:38:47,021 --> 01:38:49,857
I hope you're not wasting my time.

2285
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:54,193
I'm sorry.

2286
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:57,698
But the bag feels quick light.

2287
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:01,167
No, the code word is
Megan Good can get the wood,

2288
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:03,237
yes, it is me, Mr. Disco.

2289
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:06,939
I have my broker here on the line.

2290
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,143
He's ready to wire you $135,000.

2291
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:11,312
Do you accept?

2292
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:25,225
Nobody is there.

2293
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:29,329
Is she worth this son?

2294
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:32,265
Yes, she's worth every
cotton pickin' cent.

2295
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:35,102
Okay, give me my baby girl back.

2296
01:39:36,203 --> 01:39:39,372
As soon as the money hits my account.

2297
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:41,441
My money is good everywhere, son.

2298
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:42,443
Excuse me.

2299
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,112
You're lucky you have rich friends.

2300
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:49,649
You really fucked up this time, though.

2301
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,885
I'm through with your ass after this.

2302
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:55,788
Grab the girl.
Where is she?

2303
01:39:55,789 --> 01:39:58,359
Baby, sweetie, you all right.

2304
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:02,161
Get off of me.

2305
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:03,162
Yes.

2306
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:05,298
Baby, girl, did he hurt you?

2307
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:06,466
Did they hurt you?

2308
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,201
They're no gentlemen that I know of.

2309
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:09,302
Are you all right.

2310
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:11,137
Get her out of here, let's go.

2311
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:12,772
Thank God.

2312
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:14,340
You enjoy that money.

2313
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:15,408
Okay.

2314
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:17,510
So ridiculous, fuck.

2315
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:19,446
They didn't touch me.

2316
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:22,850
Made me pay $135,000.

2317
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:47,507
Amaya.

2318
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:48,608
Amaya!

2319
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:49,842
What?

2320
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:50,877
Can you get me some hot sauce

2321
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:51,878
out of the cabinet, please?

2322
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,179
I'm not your maid.

2323
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,081
Amaya, I am getting really tired

2324
01:40:55,082 --> 01:40:56,516
of your smart mouth.

2325
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:57,917
Would you rather me have a dumb mouth

2326
01:40:57,918 --> 01:40:59,185
like cousin Alonzo.

2327
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:01,587
Oh, Lord, please don't
let me kill this girl.

2328
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,822
You better not touch me

2329
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:04,056
or I'm gonna call CPS.

2330
01:41:04,057 --> 01:41:05,191
You wouldn't.

2331
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:06,192
Watch me.

2332
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:10,998
Either you beat her
or I'm gonna beat you.

2333
01:41:12,966 --> 01:41:15,568
No, stop, I'm sorry.

2334
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,271
That's right, whoo!

2335
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:24,177
Whoo!

2336
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:25,611
About damn time.

2337
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:27,814
Girl with the belt like this.

2338
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:30,183
Bad ass little girl.

2339
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:31,184
Shit.

2340
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:34,487
What's up, girl?

2341
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:37,490
Hey, um, you coming over later tonight.

2342
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:40,092
And what the fuck am
I coming over there for.

2343
01:41:40,093 --> 01:41:41,994
Well, you said that
if I did what you asked

2344
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:45,097
that, you know, we would be together.

2345
01:41:45,098 --> 01:41:48,234
Girl, I was just fuckin' with you man.

2346
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:50,470
Nobody want your stink ass.

2347
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:53,239
Oh, man, go brush your damn teeth.

2348
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,240
Damn, man.

2349
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:04,618
Smart ass.

2350
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,153
No shame, son.

2351
01:42:07,154 --> 01:42:08,421
She gonna do it again.

2352
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:09,356
Keep beating that ass.

2353
01:42:09,357 --> 01:42:11,023
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2354
01:42:11,024 --> 01:42:13,260
Yeah, she feeling it now.

2355
01:42:14,428 --> 01:42:16,295
Girl got a nice swing, don't she?

2356
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:18,998
Mom, please, I'm sorry.

2357
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:19,999
I love you.

2358
01:42:30,544 --> 01:42:32,044
Excuse me everybody, I would like

2359
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:33,380
to make a toast.

2360
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:36,316
You mean halitosis.

2361
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:41,087
Anyway, this toast is for

2362
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:43,857
the most self-centered, arrogant,

2363
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:47,493
son of a bitch that I know.

2364
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:50,898
This toast is for that conniving ass Von.

2365
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:55,568
I would also like to say
that Madison didn't sleep

2366
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:58,972
with Von and I didn't sleep with Preston.

2367
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:03,209
It was all just a lie created by Von

2368
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,211
to break you two up.

2369
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:07,881
Don't do this shit, no, shut up.

2370
01:43:09,783 --> 01:43:13,252
Madison, Preston, I would like to apologize

2371
01:43:13,253 --> 01:43:16,022
for my part in all of this.

2372
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:17,924
Please forgive me.

2373
01:43:17,925 --> 01:43:20,960
Oh, um, and Daddy, Alonzo and Von here,

2374
01:43:20,961 --> 01:43:23,062
they lied about all that
money that came up missing.

2375
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:24,830
What the hell?

2376
01:43:24,831 --> 01:43:25,998
Why you gonna say my name.

2377
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:27,500
Oh, you lie like shit.

2378
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:29,101
That's why your breath smell
like rotten eggs and shit.

2379
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:29,937
I knew it.

2380
01:43:29,938 --> 01:43:31,337
Bullshit.

2381
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:32,673
You are trash.

2382
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:37,811
Yeah, uh, can I get
everybody's attention please.

2383
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:44,483
So I've been wanting to
say this for a while,

2384
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:47,653
but I just was waiting for the right time

2385
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:49,722
and I feel now since we
have the whole family here

2386
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:52,258
that this is the right time.

2387
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:56,195
So Mr. Givens, I wanted to let you know

2388
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:59,298
and your family that I love
your daughter, Madison,

2389
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:02,735
more than words could ever express, right?

2390
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:06,807
And I want to spend the
rest of my life with her.

2391
01:44:09,142 --> 01:44:11,911
Would you be so kind and let me have

2392
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:14,681
your daughter's hand in marriage?

2393
01:44:16,116 --> 01:44:17,750
Marry my baby girl?
Yes.

2394
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:18,919
Oh, hell no.

2395
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:22,822
Ain't nobody good enough for my baby.

2396
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:25,992
I don't care how much
you paid them earlier.

2397
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:28,061
Maurice, how could you?

2398
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:31,598
He ain't good enough for her.

2399
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:34,033
Oh!

2400
01:44:34,034 --> 01:44:35,468
If you're gonna act like this,

2401
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:36,969
get outta my house.

2402
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:39,572
I'm not gonna let you ruin
these young people's future.

2403
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:42,976
Get your drug dealing ass outta my house.

2404
01:44:45,212 --> 01:44:47,813
All right, Preston, I'm happy.

2405
01:44:47,814 --> 01:44:48,914
Speak up!

2406
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:51,050
All right, Preston.

2407
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:53,586
I'd be happy if you'd be my son-in-law.

2408
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:55,054
Now that's better.

2409
01:44:55,055 --> 01:44:57,690
And by the way, you're
sleeping on the doggie bed

2410
01:44:57,691 --> 01:45:00,760
and you better pay him every time back.

2411
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,261
Now, Preston, dear, isn't there something

2412
01:45:02,262 --> 01:45:03,664
you wanted to do?

2413
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:06,500
Madison Givens, I...

2414
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:10,437
I want to know...

2415
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:14,006
This ring.

2416
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:18,512
Make me, Preston Mitchell,

2417
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,847
the happiest man in the world

2418
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:23,783
by marrying me and being my wife.

2419
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:26,286
Yes, yes, yes, Preston, yes.

2420
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:29,221
Hallelujah!

2421
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:30,222
Hallelujah!

2422
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:38,298
Hallelujah, hallelujah!

2423
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:45,504
Yeah.

2424
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,040
See that rock.

2425
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,375
You see that rock.

2426
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:52,112
So look, so family, just briefly,

2427
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,847
I have to take care of some business,

2428
01:45:54,848 --> 01:45:56,782
may I step away for a second?

2429
01:45:56,783 --> 01:45:58,217
Don't be too long.

2430
01:45:58,218 --> 01:45:59,251
Mrs. Mitchell.

2431
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:00,586
Yes.
Yeah.

2432
01:46:00,587 --> 01:46:02,389
Oh, my God.

2433
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:08,461
Come on, you can do it, you can do it.

2434
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:11,064
A chip off the old block.

2435
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:16,436
Married man now.

2436
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:18,671
Oh, Von.

2437
01:46:22,008 --> 01:46:23,008
Congrats bitch, I mean.

2438
01:46:23,009 --> 01:46:24,009
Whoa.

2439
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:25,811
Bro.

2440
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:29,216
I'm happy for you, man.

2441
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:34,654
Know what, Von, thank you, man.

2442
01:46:41,962 --> 01:46:44,530
Hey, dad, hey, guess what?

2443
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:46,866
I'm about to beat the
brakes off that thing.

2444
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:49,135
Oh, no you not, aw!

2445
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:50,703
Hey, Ma!

2446
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:51,904
Guess what?

2447
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:53,625
Oh, boy, just get the hell outta my face.

2448
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,175
And that's what I thought, too.

2449
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:58,410
Don't forget that shit either.

2450
01:46:58,411 --> 01:46:59,545
Once you strip it up, wreck that boss

2451
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,648
like heaven ass, whoo hoo!

2452
01:47:04,117 --> 01:47:06,520
Ham hocks, were are you girl?

2453
01:47:10,123 --> 01:47:11,123
Damn.

2454
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:16,462
What took you so long?

2455
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:18,030
I had to take my pills again,

2456
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:21,201
you know, get this baloney pony ready.

2457
01:47:25,572 --> 01:47:26,972
Yeah, yeah.

2458
01:47:26,973 --> 01:47:28,440
I'm the type of motherfucker
to give up anything.

2459
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:30,876
Well, you about to have
the time of your life.

2460
01:47:30,877 --> 01:47:31,711
You ready?

2461
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:32,546
Yes.

2462
01:47:32,547 --> 01:47:33,980
I'm ready.

2463
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:35,981
What the fuck is that?

2464
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:37,950
Oh, shit, that's a!

01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:40,554

2493
01:49:57,324 --> 01:49:58,724
Been whippin' y'all ass every year.

2494
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:00,993
Look, I told you I got
something special for your ass.

2495
01:50:00,994 --> 01:50:02,027
Man, you ain't got shit

2496
01:50:02,028 --> 01:50:03,429
but another ass whippin' coming.

2497
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,397
I got my secret weapon.

2498
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:06,398
What?

2499
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:11,471
Hey, Boo-Boo.

2500
01:50:13,473 --> 01:50:15,008
Boo-Boo?

2501
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:24,683
Oh, shit, huh.

2502
01:50:24,684 --> 01:50:26,920
I'm about to play the game.

2503
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:30,924
Let's really rock and roll.

2504
01:50:56,783 --> 01:50:58,183
Hey, can you even catch?

2505
01:50:58,184 --> 01:50:59,718
Yeah, I could catch.

2506
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:01,221
Well, catch this mitten.

2507
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:03,656
Fire breath, hut.

2508
01:51:20,573 --> 01:51:22,441
I'm running past your holy ass.

2509
01:51:22,442 --> 01:51:24,309
You don't want none of this, Unc?

2510
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:25,145
Yo, yo, yo, get, get, get, go.

Touchdown!

2512

You ready.

2513
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:44,897
Are you ready?

2514
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:46,218
Yo, ready, hey, give me the ball.

2515
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,569
Encyclopedia page 44,
42, a second opinion.

2516
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:52,205
Fuckin' nerd.
Go!

2517
01:51:53,807 --> 01:51:55,074
