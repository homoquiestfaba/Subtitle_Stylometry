1
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,799
Our God is marching on

2
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,839
Glory, glory, hallelujah

3
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,599
Glory, glory, hallelujah

4
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,799
Glory, glory, hallelujah

5
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,039
His truth is marching on

6
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,319
In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea

7
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,239
With a glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me

8
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,239
As He died to make men holy,
let us die to make men free

9
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,559
While God is marching on

10
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,599
Glory, glory, hallelujah

11
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,439
Glory, glory, hallelujah

12
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,759
Glory, glory, hallelujah

13
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,239
His truth is marching on

14
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,760
Please be seated.

15
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,639
Chuck always said to me,
"Wilbur...

16
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,919
you talk too much".

17
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,519
So he'd be pleased
that his beloved daughter, Marie,

18
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,360
is going to say a few words.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,159
I know that daddy
would be very pleased to see

20
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,279
so many veterans here today.

21
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,559
Especially members of
the 401st Bomber Group.

22
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,720
I guess he would want to talk

23
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,319
I guess he would want me
to talk about his life...

24
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,639
...and about the most
important thing in his life,

25
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,159
his love for my mother.

26
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,559
He was a brave man
in wartime in his lifetime,

27
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,040
and in the long illness
that led to his death.

28
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,039
But his was an unspoken bravery.

29
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,079
His heroism was as quiet
and as constant as he was.

30
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,960
Many loved him.

31
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,039
You don't smoke.

32
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,000
I thought I'd take it up again.

33
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,439
You should be in there, you know.

34
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,639
I know what she's gonna say.

35
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,439
I just can't sit there and
listen to all of that.

36
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,360
I understand.

37
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,040
Only you would understand.

38
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,159
I'm really sorry.

39
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,319
No need to.

40
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,079
It was his time to go.

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,239
No, I mean about being late.

42
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,440
I mean I'm sorry about that too,
I mean, about him...

43
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,599
It's all gassed up, dad.

44
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,999
It's ready to go.

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,080
Good.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,239
Sure you want this?

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,760
He would.

48
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,399
You won't remember daddy
for what he said.

49
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,079
As you know, he didn't say much.

50
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,319
He never spoke to me
about the past,

51
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,039
about the war and
about his medals.

52
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,839
Not even once.

53
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,399
He felt that a man should be
judged for his work...

54
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,319
...and for the way
that he led his life.

55
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,919
Marie will be upset that you
missed her eulogy.

56
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,640
I don't think Marie cares
either way if I'm there.

57
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,239
Your husband was a fine man.

58
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,320
Yeah.

59
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,919
You'll miss him very much.

60
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
No.

61
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,319
Well, I know you loved him, so

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,199
He never believed that, Peter.

63
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,000
All the years I wore this ring
we never talked much about love.

64
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,599
Would you like me to
take you back inside?

65
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,240
No.

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,240
They'll roll him out
when they're through.

67
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,640
At least he has a grave.

68
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
Hello.

69
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,400
Hello.

70
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,719
Bloody hell!

71
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,399
What the devil do you mean,
creeping up on me like that?

72
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,799
What you digging for?

73
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,559
Who the hell are you?

74
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm Jimmy.

75
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,719
Eleanor Reilly's wee lad?

76
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,079
I know you.

77
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,959
She's my granny.

78
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,720
My mum went away
she is back any time now.

79
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,079
Does your granny know
you're up here?

80
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,959
Don't know.

81
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,319
Well, you go home

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,679
Tell her Mr Quinlan said you're
not to come up here again.

83
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,999
This is a dangerous place,
do you not know that?

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,359
The Army is here all the time.

85
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,519
If it's not them,
it's the Republicans,

86
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,079
the bloody IRA.

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,399
So what are you doing here then?

88
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,439
None of your bloody business!

89
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,159
You're digging something.

90
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,879
I dig here sometimes
for my granny.

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,520
I can keep a secret, you know.

92
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,360
You tell me one secret
you've ever kept.

93
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,999
My granny keeps photographs.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,599
In her dressing-table.

95
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
You what?

96
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,479
From the war Americans.

97
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,239
And that's your secret, is it?

98
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,800
Yes.

99
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,679
Well, it's not any more,
you halfwit!

100
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,679
You just told me.

101
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,159
But you asked.

102
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,799
Do you want to spend your whole
life being a complete eejit?

103
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,040
No wonder your mammy buggered off.

104
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,680
Oh, shit!

105
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Jimmy.

106
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,079
Come on, back up here.

107
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,519
Give me a hand

108
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,920
Come on

109
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,879
And listen don't you
tell your granny.

110
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,879
Promise... Cross my heart.

111
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,520
Yes.

112
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,799
What is it?

113
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
Treasure.

114
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,999
The past, boy.

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
The past.

116
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,319
That's a Harvard.

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,400
Here he comes.

118
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,560
That's Jack.

119
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,359
Is that your crazy father?

120
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,719
It's a tradition, Marie.

121
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,639
God, you're as stupid as he is.

122
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,199
Flies beautiful, doesn't it?

123
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,879
He could have killed us.

124
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,319
He's not allowed to fly that low.

125
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,799
Don't make a fuss, Marie.

126
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,759
It's exactly what your daddy
would have wanted.

127
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,439
Oh, really?

128
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,279
Is he doing it for daddy,
or is he doing it to impress you?

129
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,119
You don't know
what you're talking about.

130
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,679
Is he coming around again?

131
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,799
Oh, I certainly hope so.

132
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,320
You should take this.

133
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,079
There's a family trapped.

134
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,560
That's it.

135
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,920
One down, on the right.

136
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,759
Michael Quinlan,
where in God's name have you been?!

137
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,039
Get in that shelter right away!

138
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,439
Everybody outside, come on. Run!

139
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,920
Run!

140
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,720
No messing about, come on!

141
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Eleanor.

142
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,759
Didn't expect to find you here.

143
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,919
Well, where did you
expect to find me?

144
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,119
Not usually with us.

145
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,559
In the Georgian Hotel with one of
your gentleman friends.

146
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,359
I do more for the war effort
than you, Mrs Doyle.

147
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
Making your woolly underwear
for the troops.

148
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,560
And you taking it off fast
as they can put it on.

149
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,079
Michael,
we missed you at evening Mass.

150
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,399
You'd have got here
in time for a seat.

151
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Michael.

152
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,359
You're a big lad now.

153
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,119
Will you be joining the Army,
fighting for King and country?

154
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,559
No, I'm gonna
be a fireman like my Da.

155
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,599
You can sit here, Michael.

156
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,519
Can I sit there?

157
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,960
No.

158
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,360
No.

159
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,439
We can't possibly mix
both congregations, Michael.

160
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm forced to agree
with him there, Michael.

161
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Cathal?

162
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,999
Sweet Jesus, is that you?

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,479
You're taking a chance,
aren't you?

164
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,559
Cathal, you'll
get yourself caught.

165
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,999
They've put
a reward out for you.

166
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,119
I don't care.

167
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,880
Here.

168
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,439
These are for you.

169
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
Look, I had to see you.

170
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,320
Eggs!

171
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,119
Dear God in heaven!

172
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,399
He has connections
over the border.

173
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,559
I thought you were away fighting
for the other side, Cathal Thomas.

174
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,199
He's right.

175
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,719
It's a dangerous place for you.

176
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,359
Is he fighting for the Germans?

177
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,640
IRA.

178
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,839
You should join us.

179
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,839
Don't you dare.

180
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,839
Thousands of good Catholic Irishmen
serving in the British Army,

181
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,639
fighting against Fascism

182
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,239
My son's one of them.

183
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,279
And you... you're a damned traitor.

184
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,760
Cathal.

185
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,480
I say, hello,
are you all right in there?

186
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,920
Hello?

187
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,199
You all right in there?

188
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,439
Cathal, no.

189
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,920
Don't!

190
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,439
We'll not say anything.

191
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,839
If he's a policeman,
I'll kill him!

192
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,599
He's a Brit.

193
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,039
He's Army, not police, Cathal.

194
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,919
He won't know you.

195
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,559
Hold the door.

196
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,839
Come on, Mr Cobb!

197
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,480
Hurry up!

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,400
Come on!

199
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,160
Hello?

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,640
The door is stuck.

201
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,400
Don't.

202
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,920
Don't say a word.

203
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,240
Evening.

204
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,399
Good evening, Officer.

205
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,479
Everyone all right?

206
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,400
Fine.

207
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,319
We're fine.

208
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,239
Do you think they've gone for
the night, sir?

209
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,159
I think so, but there may be
some unexploded stuff.

210
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,879
So best stay down here
till the all-clear

211
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,159
Could you pass the word.

212
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,039
We need an ambulance
in Market Street.

213
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,679
Four casualties.

214
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,760
I like your helmet.

215
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,119
What on earth is this?

216
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,440
Where did you get it?

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,479
Bloody thing is loaded!

218
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,559
Who gave this to you?

219
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,559
You little idiot, Quinlan.

220
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,959
What are you doing with that?

221
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,159
Belonged to his old Da.

222
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,559
From the last war.

223
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Souvenir.

224
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,599
He'll scalp your arse, so he will.

225
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,479
I've got to confiscate this.

226
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,279
No need to tell the police,
though.

227
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,719
Sure, he's only a wee lad.

228
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,240
No.

229
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
No need.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,159
Are the police up there now?

231
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,359
The local boys?

232
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,039
Afraid not.

233
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,199
Just my chaps from the barracks.

234
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,519
I'll come up and give you a hand.

235
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,440
Thanks.

236
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,440
Oh, Jesus.

237
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,079
Get the hell out of here, Cathal.

238
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,439
We should have given you up.

239
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,640
You could have, but you didn't.

240
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
None of you did.

241
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,399
Is this what we're looking for,
Mr Quinlan?

242
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,159
Just a piece of iron?

243
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,560
Aluminium.

244
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,439
From the fuselage.

245
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,399
Or the wings, maybe.

246
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,239
Biggest piece I ever found - B-17.

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,559
You know what that is?

248
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,160
Sure.

249
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,479
It's a rock group.

250
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,920
A band.

251
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,679
It's not a bloody band.

252
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,679
It's an airplane, you eejit.

253
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh, right.

254
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,119
Crashed here.

255
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,719
50 years ago.

256
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
Ten people killed.

257
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,479
Blown to bits.

258
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,679
They've all forgotten,
but I remember.

259
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,399
You remember it crashing?

260
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,639
I heard it.

261
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,759
I lived down the bottom,
Murray Street.

262
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,800
Still do.

263
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,359
What do you do this for,
Mr Quinlan?

264
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,599
What are you looking for?

265
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,479
Why should I be
looking for anything?

266
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,839
Why do you dig all this up then?

267
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,999
Just shut up and
give me a hand here.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,520
See if we can lift it.

269
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,239
Hey, Ethel Ann, come on.

270
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,159
But... okay.

271
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,280
Wilbur?

272
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
Oh, no.

273
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,559
Okay, chocks in and checked.

274
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,600
Come on out, sirs.

275
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,679
That was the most incredible
thing I've ever done!

276
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,399
Hello, fellas!

277
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,639
That was fantastic.

278
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,759
Jack, those B-17s are
just the greatest!

279
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,919
It's a piece of cake to fly, too.

280
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,799
Pilot showed us how.

281
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,240
Oh, sure.

282
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,439
You wanna take us up now then,
Chuck?

283
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:25,960
You know.

284
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,479
I feel like I could though,
you know.

285
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,599
You look swell, Ethel Ann.

286
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,679
Yeah, okay, come on.

287
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,319
Who wants a soda?

288
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,199
Let's go to Joe's.

289
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,279
But I thought you all had classes?

290
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,959
So, we skip one.

291
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,519
You'll get in trouble.

292
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,799
We're all gonna get in trouble,
there's a war coming!

293
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,599
Yes, trouble!

294
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,960
Big trouble!

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,199
So, it's supposed to be
the final approach...

296
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,199
...and we're thinking
something's wrong...

297
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,359
We're flying at the runway at,
God, 200 knots!

298
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,319
And the instructor says,

299
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,159
"Well, buddy... " well

300
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,159
...how about putting down
the flaps?".

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,639
And the pilot goes,
"Oh, shoot!".

302
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,080
And wham!

303
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,519
Puts down the flaps,

304
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,079
but he pulls back the stick
at the same time.

305
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,159
That airplane must have been
standing straight on its tail.

306
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,879
No, wait,
I saw you guys coming in.

307
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,440
You were like that was me.

308
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,719
Anybody want another soda?

309
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,279
No, thank you.

310
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,920
No, thanks, Jack.

311
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,799
I wish I'd been up there with
you I really wanna fly.

312
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,719
I don't think the Air Force
would like that.

313
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,440
You got any cash?

314
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,639
There's plenty of girl pilots.

315
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,959
Amelia Earhart.

316
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,840
Yeah.

317
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,039
But not in a B-17.

318
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,479
Not with a bunch of hairy
apes like us.

319
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,079
So what about pilot school?

320
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,919
Still going?

321
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,839
I don't know.

322
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,639
The other guys are okay,
but I got problems with math.

323
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,879
They won't stop me
from going up there.

324
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,799
Bombardier, gunner.

325
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,119
I don't care.

326
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,999
Nor do I,
so long as you're happy.

327
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm happy.

328
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,480
I've never been so happy.

329
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,599
Seems the whole town is
in love with that girl.

330
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,959
Never thought she'd choose
the country boy.

331
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,799
Country boy?

332
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,839
I trust him with my life.

333
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,919
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

334
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,319
Young love, huh?

335
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,600
Come on.

336
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,119
One hamburger and three fries.

337
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,720
Chuck

338
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,839
Come on, lover boy.

339
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
Come on, guys.

340
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,520
Marie.

341
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,160
Marie?

342
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,359
I guess you upset her.

343
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,640
Not hard to do.

344
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,879
Stupid tune.

345
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,239
Oh, come on,
they were great tunes.

346
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,999
I need a drink.

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,399
Steady, you've had a few already.

348
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Why not?

349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,999
I can have anything I want now.

350
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,640
Yeah.

351
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,199
What do you want, Ethel?

352
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
Go inside.

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,759
Well, at least let me
get the door for you.

354
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,439
I can get the door, thank you.

355
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,959
I've lived here long enough.

356
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
Well, just as you please.

357
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,319
This house.

358
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,360
Yeah.

359
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,079
Does seem kind of strange,
doesn't it?

360
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,759
Coming back to the house that he
built without him in it.

361
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,120
Yes.

362
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
Sure.

363
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,639
Jack, thank you for
the air raid and all.

364
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,919
My pleasure, girl.

365
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,519
Scared me half to death.

366
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,759
You ought to lose your licence.

367
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,359
Yeah, that's what the Sheriff said.

368
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,279
But I told him it was
an old tradition.

369
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,079
Class of June '42.

370
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,479
Go home, Jack.

371
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,279
What do you mean, now?

372
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,360
Yes, now.

373
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,639
Come on, dad.

374
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,920
Okay.

375
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,119
You won't forget
to do something for me,

376
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,279
will you, Ethel?

377
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,879
What's that?

378
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,320
Grieve.

379
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,599
Your father's picture
at the Air Academy.

380
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,199
Put it back, please.

381
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,360
Sorry.

382
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,079
You never talk about those times.

383
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,279
Neither did dad.

384
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,880
No.

385
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,599
Did you know a lot of these boys?

386
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,079
Yes, they were
a great bunch of guys.

387
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,599
We had some good times.

388
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,999
Could you tell me about it?

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
Could you tell me about them?

390
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,159
What you want to know
is whether I did it

391
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,759
with one of them and which one.

392
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,200
No.

393
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,639
Well, why not?

394
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,319
It's notjust a picture,
they were flesh and blood.

395
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,599
Okay, just forget it.

396
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,279
Have you been with Pete yet?

397
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,800
What?

398
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,999
Jack's boy, Pete.

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,359
Have you been with him yet?

400
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,439
Mom, what has gotten into you?

401
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,519
How much have you been drinking?

402
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,879
Time you got something
for yourself, Marie.

403
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,359
Life is passing you by.

404
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,719
Peter is a nice guy.

405
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm just not ready.

406
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,759
But you must never,
ever let a man build you a house.

407
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,240
No.

408
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,959
As long as you stay there,
he'll stay with you.

409
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,800
You may try to hide him
but he'll be there, inside it.

410
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,919
Why don't you try it with Peter?

411
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,519
Would you stop talking about sex?

412
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,879
You shouldn't be thinking about
that right now.

413
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,320
Really?

414
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,599
Well, what the hell else
should I be thinking about?

415
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,159
Daddy! We just buried him!

416
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Yes.

417
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Right.

418
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,040
I guess this means I won't be
getting any any more, huh?

419
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,519
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

420
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
Me, too.

421
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,280
Your father was a fine man.

422
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,359
I guess I should be
grateful to him.

423
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
Grateful?

424
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,599
The boys at the Academy I didn't.

425
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,400
I mean, it wasn't like that.

426
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,759
I was faithful.

427
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,159
I was always always,
always, always faithful.

428
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,520
So, how do you say three
I's in Spanish?

429
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,760
I, ya, ya.

430
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,719
It's so big.

431
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,919
He had his cousins
helping him over the winter.

432
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,719
But they're back at the farm now,
so we're helping him finish it.

433
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,840
That's it.

434
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,799
Good morning.

435
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,240
Morning.

436
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,319
Teddy around?

437
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,199
Back at the house.

438
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,640
Thank you.

439
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,359
It's beautiful.

440
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,199
He's sure been working hard.

441
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
Hey!

442
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,159
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

443
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,159
I fell asleep upstairs.

444
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,399
You've framed out
the upstairs already?

445
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,519
Sure have, I there's
so much more to do though.

446
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,399
Could you guys help me
bring up the latest delivery?

447
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,359
That pile up by the road?

448
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,280
Yeah.

449
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,320
Sure

450
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,439
Yeah, we can do that for you.

451
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,439
Come on, Chuck.

452
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,159
Jack, these are my best clothes.

453
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,440
Come on.

454
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,079
How come you've told me
so little about this place?

455
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,799
It's no secret.

456
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,639
Where did you
get the money for it?

457
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,039
My dad left
me this piece of land.

458
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,799
A little cash.

459
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,719
I worked in a sawmill last summer,
and they they paid me in lumber.

460
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,360
I wanna look upstairs.

461
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,559
I thought you told me you were
away getting an education?

462
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,079
That was it, I guess.

463
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,479
I read books, too.

464
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,999
Place is solid.

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,159
Building up to a standard,

466
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,119
not down to a price,
is what the lumber guy said.

467
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,759
Oh, I'll bet he did.

468
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,520
Hey, buzzard.

469
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,159
He's around here all the time
Keeps me company.

470
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,839
You've almost moved in.

471
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah.

472
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,719
I may be running out of time.

473
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,319
What do you mean?

474
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,159
The war I guess.

475
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,039
So it's gonna come, then?

476
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,200
That's why we all
joined the Air Academy.

477
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,999
Why are you doing all this?

478
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,399
Your folks wouldn't
like me one bit.

479
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,199
But when I do ask them,
I've gotta have something I can show.

480
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,079
Something I can give you.

481
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
You're building this house for me?

482
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,999
If I get into the Air Force

483
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,999
become a Sergeant maybe, then

484
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,959
that'd be something.

485
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,199
And then I could ask your folks.

486
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,040
I'd be some kind of gentleman.

487
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,839
You are a gentleman, Teddy.

488
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,199
I sure don't smell like one just now.

489
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
Let me try.

490
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,360
Excuse me?

491
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,159
Let me smell you.

492
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,079
Are you kidding?

493
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,480
No.

494
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,439
I wanna remember you.

495
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Just as you are now.

496
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,800
Don't move.

497
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,439
I wanna remember
this moment all my life.

498
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,839
Teddy, Ethel Ann?

499
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,160
No.

500
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,120
Teddy?

501
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,040
Come on, Chuck... Let's go.

502
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,840
You're so beautiful.

503
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,319
Sometimes I can still smell it.

504
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,040
What?

505
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,919
Aviation fuel.

506
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,599
That was 50 years ago.

507
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,999
And you said it burnt.

508
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,079
Some soaked into the ground,
maybe.

509
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,119
I can't smell it,
but, look, I found this.

510
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,040
What is it?

511
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,519
Granny says
I shouldn't mix with you.

512
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,439
You promised me
you wouldn't tell her.

513
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,239
She says you're worse
than a Protestant.

514
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,479
What's worse than a Protestant?

515
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,239
An atheist.

516
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,799
Mr Quinlan, what we're doing,
is it illegal?

517
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
Probably.

518
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,599
Only there's a man over there.

519
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,879
Do we stop digging?

520
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,919
Turn away, don't look at him.

521
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,279
He'll not bother us.

522
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,479
You took your time, Cathal.

523
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,519
Mr Thomas to you

524
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,799
There was no need
for you to be here.

525
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,639
Just an observer.

526
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,959
Do they think I can't
run my own operation?

527
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,439
Why did they change the target?

528
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,959
Wouldn't want to
lose support community.

529
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,879
And we have interests in that area.

530
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,839
You mean you're
selling drugs there.

531
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,039
Beautiful view

532
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,679
Who is the old man?

533
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,319
He's digging up an airplane.

534
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,519
It crashed here.

535
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,439
And you let him do it?

536
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,079
I know him.

537
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,999
Digging on Black Mountain
is a bad idea.

538
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,799
Never know what you'll find.

539
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,719
What I gave you, what is it?

540
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,039
It's very good.

541
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,239
A switch... Radio, maybe.

542
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,080
Intercom.

543
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,079
I'll get it home,
do some research.

544
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,839
I found that, you know

545
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,400
By rights it's mine.

546
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,919
Shankhill Road.

547
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,040
Yes.

548
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,119
You're an atheist then?

549
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,039
You don't believe in God and

550
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,479
the Blessed Virgin Mary
and all that stuff?

551
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,440
No.

552
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,560
Why not?

553
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,919
30 years of being
a fireman in Belfast.

554
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,119
Clearing up after that lot.

555
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,279
Will there be a second one?

556
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,839
There's always a second one.

557
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,639
That's the one does the damage.

558
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,199
They wait until the Army get there,
or the police.

559
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,519
Or the bloody firemen.

560
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,680
There.

561
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,279
It's ready.

562
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,719
Last time a man used this switch
was 50 years ago.

563
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,519
And that man was killed.

564
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,959
Right here, in this very spot.

565
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,399
Here, you found it, you do it.

566
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,559
No, thanks.

567
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Why not?

568
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,319
Don't want to.

569
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,120
All right

570
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
I will.

571
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,560
Jesus.

572
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,359
What the hell was that?!

573
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,079
It's too bloody soon!

574
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,079
It was supposed to be
set for 20 minutes.

575
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,839
Maybe just as well.

576
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,199
High Command thinks that bombs
may be a little old-fashioned.

577
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,039
"Counter-productive at this stage
of the struggle. "

578
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,959
Counter-bollocks!

579
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,639
It's a war we're fighting here

580
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,999
Yes that we are.

581
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,759
And maybe you're
losing it for us, Cathal.

582
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,320
Have you thought of that?

583
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,279
We have suffered a serious
setback in Hawaii.

584
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,319
Many American soldiers and sailors
have been killed by enemy action.

585
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,839
American ships have been sunk,

586
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,639
American airplanes
have been destroyed.

587
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,519
The lives of our soldiers and
sailors depend upon the manner

588
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,639
in which each and every one of us

589
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,119
fulfills his obligation to
our country.

590
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,999
Gunnery School?

591
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Yeah.

592
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,039
Well, when do you go?

593
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,520
Next week.

594
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,199
Chuck is training as a pilot.

595
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,279
Jack is gonna be a navigator,
and they need gunners, so that's me.

596
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,160
I have to go.

597
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,799
So it's over, then?

598
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,160
All this.

599
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,520
Oh, no.

600
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,279
I'm gonna send postcards home
every day.

601
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,159
My folks think I'm walking out
with Chuck.

602
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,839
Good old reliable Chuck.

603
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,279
If they only knew it was you.

604
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,959
Well, I'm not gonna send them
to your folks' house, Ethel Ann.

605
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,199
I'm gonna send them here I mean,
when any of us guys get leave

606
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,719
we're gonna come back here,
we're gonna finish the house.

607
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,279
I can put a telephone in.

608
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,119
What are those places in college,

609
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,479
where everybody stays
like brothers?

610
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,959
Fraternity.

611
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,439
Okay, well, this will be
our fraternity house.

612
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,239
Chuck can get away
from his parents

613
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,319
and Jack can get away from
all of his girlfriends

614
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,759
and we can be together.

615
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,999
I mean, this is your home.

616
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,480
It can't be my home without you.

617
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,080
When I'm through Gunnery School,
they'll give me some leave.

618
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,919
You could marry me.

619
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,519
We could do it secret,
but when I'm back for good,

620
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,399
we'll do it proper,
we'll invite everybody.

621
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,599
Is that all right?

622
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,760
Ethel Ann, say it's all right.

623
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,640
It's gold.

624
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,039
I love you.

625
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,080
I guess I'm just not used to
feeling so much.

626
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,759
I will always love you, Teddy.

627
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,919
I'll be yours till the day I die,
I swear it.

628
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,839
There won't be room for anyone
else in my heart but you.

629
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,039
No-one else, not ever.

630
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,599
Till I'm laid in my grave.

631
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,320
I love you.

632
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,679
Mom, are you all right?

633
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,639
What are you doing in my room?

634
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,039
This is not your room.

635
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,599
What do you mean?

636
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,479
I'm moving back into this room.

637
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,720
But you and daddy were always
in the other room, you

638
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,559
Okay, if you want my room,
that's fine.

639
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,239
I understand.

640
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,039
Mom, why don't you come to
the grave with me today?

641
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,199
It's a beautiful grave.

642
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,319
We can just be there together
with him.

643
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,840
Who?

644
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,839
Dad, of course.

645
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,799
Your father, he was a fine man.

646
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,039
He saved my life, actually.

647
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,399
You know, picked me up
put me back together.

648
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,039
Always treated me right.

649
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,519
He was a fine man,
he was a good husband.

650
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,799
Is that what you want?

651
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,959
No, what I want is for you to
start grieving like everyone else.

652
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,439
Grieving I was 21 years old.

653
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,599
My life was over.

654
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,439
You don't know what grieving is.

655
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:37,960
21?

656
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,239
What do you mean?

657
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,879
It's none of your business.

658
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,519
That was before you married daddy.

659
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,719
Before I was born.

660
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,839
What happened?

661
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,239
I am going to
move in here tonight.

662
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,239
This is my house,

663
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,520
and if you don't like it,
you can leave.

664
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,000
So leave.

665
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,880
Hi.

666
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,040
Hi.

667
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,399
Have a seat.

668
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,559
Can I get you something?

669
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,319
No, thanks.

670
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,199
Peter, would you mind
giving us a minute?

671
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,760
Sure.

672
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,400
Thanks.

673
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,800
Sorry.

674
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,479
When I was a kid,
this was the Soda Fountain.

675
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,879
Your Ma used to come here
all the time.

676
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,439
She loved those disgusting
root beer floats.

677
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,839
Her life was over at 21

678
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,879
That's what she said.

679
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,559
I'm trying to understand, Jack.

680
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,959
What happened to her?

681
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,960
The war happened,
for Christ's sake.

682
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,439
And the kids she knew,
some of them didn't make it back.

683
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,679
Yeah, but you did, and dad did.

684
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,599
Yeah, that's right.

685
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,519
He was shot up in a B-17,
she nursed him back to health

686
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,599
she put him back together.

687
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,399
No, she said that he
put her back together.

688
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,319
Well, they helped each other.

689
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,439
All right,
so they helped each other.

690
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,159
But what happened?

691
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,319
She said her life was over, Jack.

692
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
Hi, Jack.

693
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,080
Oh, hi.

694
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,679
Look let me give you
a piece of advice.

695
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,399
If I were you,

696
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,399
I wouldn'tjust come in here
and start digging around.

697
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,759
The past has gone.

698
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,519
Digging around?

699
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,599
What am I supposed to do?

700
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,519
Pretend that nothing is wrong?

701
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,599
You don't understand what
it's like at home without dad.

702
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,359
I knew Chuck for 50 years.

703
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,839
For 40 of them, he sat right
there where you are now.

704
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,719
Don't tell me I don't understand.

705
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,159
And if your

706
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:54,040
Ma doesn't want to talk to you
that's none of my business, is it?

707
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,880
So get the hell out of here.

708
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,960
And that's just
what she told me to do.

709
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,559
Hey, you okay?

710
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,960
I'm sorry.

711
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,039
What did you say to her?

712
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,520
Too much.

713
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,440
Not enough.

714
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,119
Hi, granny.

715
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,159
You know, I made you your tea.

716
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,919
And it's gone stone-cold,
and I had to give it to the cat.

717
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,519
No, not more of
that filthy stuff!

718
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,999
Please, don't do that.

719
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,759
Oh, no, Jimmy.

720
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,679
At least use your own blade.

721
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,079
Don't be using my good knife.

722
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,399
In fact, I wish you wouldn't
go up that mountain at all,

723
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,239
do you know that?

724
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,639
Because things go on there

725
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,599
that you shouldn't be
poking your wee nose into.

726
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,239
What things?

727
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,439
Just things, son.

728
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,519
And I wish you wouldn't mess
around with that Quinlan fella.

729
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,359
He said he knew you
when you were young.

730
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,359
Never, never, never!

731
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,399
He's a born liar, that fellow.

732
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,639
Always was.

733
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,679
So you did know him, then?

734
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,239
If you spent more time
looking for ajob...

735
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,519
Don't be stupid, granny.

736
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,239
Don't you call me stupid!

737
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,759
I've worked all my life.

738
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,559
There are no jobs.

739
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,239
Then go to London,
find your mother.

740
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,439
And that pimp she ran away with.

741
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,479
And clean that up after you,
will you?

742
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,559
And don't use the sink again.

743
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,719
This is not a hotel.

744
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,479
This is me who has to keep
this place clean, young man.

745
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm not spending my life
cleaning after you

746
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,680
Ethel.

747
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,639
Ethel and Teddy.

748
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,760
Ethel and Teddy.

749
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,920
Teddy?

750
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,839
Looking sharp.

751
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,280
You ready?

752
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:41,880
I'm ready.

753
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,759
Want a beer?

754
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,999
We got it all worked out.

755
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,520
Great.

756
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,759
Jack stole the key.

757
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,879
I borrowed it.

758
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,039
This place looks great.

759
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,399
Nice job setting it up.

760
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,759
Yeah, I thought I'd bring
her straight back here, you know?

761
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,399
Carry her across the threshold.

762
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,000
Sure.

763
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,239
Be out of your way.

764
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,720
Oh, no.

765
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,239
Me and Ethel Ann,
we don't want that.

766
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,639
I mean this is the last time

767
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,439
we're gonna have to spend together
before we leave.

768
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,999
And you're both officers, right?

769
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,559
So I'm not gonna be able to
talk to you after this.

770
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,199
Yeah, you will.

771
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,839
We got plans.

772
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,639
We're gonna fly together
in the same plane.

773
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,159
There's no there's no
chance of that.

774
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,239
Yes, there is.

775
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,679
I've been dating this girl down
in Personnel Administrations.

776
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,599
I can pull some strings.

777
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,839
Yep, we can fly together.

778
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,680
No?

779
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,839
What do you mean, no?

780
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,479
I've been working on
this girl for weeks.

781
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,759
Well, I mean,
what if we didn't come back?

782
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,239
All three of us in one B-17.

783
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,559
Jesus Christ, Teddy.

784
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,760
No.

785
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:37,880
Okay?

786
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,280
We are not all flying
in one plane.

787
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,319
If I don't make it through this
I gotta know

788
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,239
that there's somebody
to look after Ethel Ann.

789
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,999
To take my place.

790
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,919
There's no-one could do that,
Teddy.

791
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,879
Oh, really?

792
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,479
So I'm the only person
in this room

793
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,360
that's in love with Ethel Ann?

794
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,200
What are you talking about?

795
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,119
No, I mean,
I think she's a great girl.

796
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,759
She's wonderful.

797
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,400
But, no!

798
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,519
You're not in love with her?

799
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,879
No, I'm not!

800
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,280
All right.

801
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,320
But Chuck is.

802
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,039
God, Teddy, I...

803
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
It's okay, buddy.

804
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,720
It's okay.

805
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,079
She's yours, Teddy.

806
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,359
I never I would never,
ever, I swear.

807
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,399
She doesn't know, she never will.

808
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,359
Chuck... shut up.

809
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,160
It's just practical.

810
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,040
I need to know that there'll be
someone to look after her.

811
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,719
What about Jack?

812
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,280
Jack?

813
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:53,960
Whoa, no.

814
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,239
Guys, I'm not that kind of guy.

815
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,359
He's already got girls
in every state.

816
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,039
I drink, I smoke, I belch.

817
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,999
And he can't dance.

818
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,559
I can't dance.

819
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,519
You're the dancer.

820
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,119
You're the guy.

821
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,559
This isn't even gonna happen.

822
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,239
You're gonna come back,
you're gonna have seventeen kids.

823
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,679
You're gonna gonna
find a nice girl from Idaho.

824
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,799
She'll be a potato.

825
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,960
In a sack.

826
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,559
So it's all right then
if I can fix it

827
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,639
for you and I to fly together?

828
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,679
Jack, that would be great.

829
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,519
Teddy, I never

830
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,000
I know.

831
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,560
I know.

832
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,959
I know that, Chuck.

833
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,039
But if something happens to me,
you gotta care for Ethel Ann.

834
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,279
Promise me.

835
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,840
I promise.

836
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,359
Jack, you promise to help?

837
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,319
Sure I promise.

838
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,719
You guys believe in God?

839
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,880
Yes.

840
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,519
I don't know.

841
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,200
No, me neither.

842
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,000
Let's say a prayer.

843
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,039
Dear God...

844
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,959
tomorrow we're leaving for combat.

845
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,039
And today I'm getting married.

846
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,160
Both of which are pretty dangerous.

847
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,400
Oh, hi.

848
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,120
Jack.

849
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,239
Maybe you were expecting Pete.

850
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,400
No.

851
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,919
I guess you haven't seen
each other for a while, huh?

852
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,679
Jeez, that music is loud!

853
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,479
Yeah, it is.

854
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,719
She's not going out any more,
not even to dad's grave.

855
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,439
She's drinking,
she's cutting everyone off.

856
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,639
Well, you are, too.

857
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,119
Pete misses you, you know.

858
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,879
For God's sakes, Jack,
I like Peter,

859
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,959
but now is not the time.

860
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,119
Okay... Sure.

861
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,679
Front bedroom.

862
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,839
She won't sleep in her
and daddy's room any more.

863
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,480
She's moved into mine.

864
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,639
The front room?

865
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,599
She's moved back in there?

866
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,519
What do you mean, back?

867
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,279
That was always my room.

868
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,839
They were always in the other one.

869
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,560
Jack?

870
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,720
Look

871
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,159
Answer the phone, Marie,
and give her these, please.

872
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,799
I'll come back some other time.

873
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,560
Jack?

874
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,480
Jack

875
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,120
Hello?

876
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,159
Is that America?

877
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,639
Is this ajoke?

878
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,880
No, wait.

879
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,879
It's all right, I got through.

880
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,639
So maybe you'll finish
before midnight!

881
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,519
Could I speak to Mrs Gordon,
please?

882
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,679
You've got the wrong number.

883
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,559
No, I mean, sorry, I mean

884
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,399
Mrs Roberts.

885
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,959
Mrs Ethel Roberts.

886
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,039
That was my mother's name
before she was married.

887
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,159
Who is this?

888
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,879
My name is Jimmy.

889
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,479
Could I speak to her?

890
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,119
About what?

891
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:08,359
I'm calling from Belfast and
I don't have a lot of money.

892
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,159
All right, just a minute.

893
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,000
Pennsylvania 6-5000

894
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,320
Mom?

895
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,480
Yes.

896
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,320
There's a phone call for you.

897
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,679
Will you pick up the phone?

898
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,119
No, thanks, sweetheart.

899
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,880
Mom?

900
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,279
No, thank you.

901
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,080
It's a man, says he's from Belfast.

902
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,560
Mom?

903
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,719
Pennsylvania 6-5000

904
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,599
She doesn't wanna answer,
you'll have to leave a message.

905
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,360
Hello?

906
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,880
Hello?

907
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,839
Can you hear me?

908
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,159
Now, just a minute, please.

909
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,040
Mom?

910
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,800
Hello?

911
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,959
Did you pick up?

912
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,280
Hello?

913
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,800
Hello?

914
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,440
Hello?

915
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,240
Hello?

916
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,039
Who is this, please?

917
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,839
My name is Jimmy Reilly.

918
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,119
I'm calling from Belfast.

919
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,599
Could I speak to Ethel.

920
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,999
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
what her name is now.

921
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,400
Marie?

922
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,119
Marie, you can hang up now,
please.

923
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,520
Okay.

924
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,159
They told me she
wouldn't have the same address,

925
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,719
not after 50 years
but I thought I'd try anyway.

926
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,639
Are you there?

927
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,039
What do you want?

928
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,119
I have something
belonging to you.

929
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,359
Well, I think it belongs to you.

930
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,559
It's a ring.

931
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,279
A gold ring.

932
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,319
It's got names on the inside.

933
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,000
A ring?

934
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,880
Yeah

935
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,559
It says 'Ethel and Teddy'.

936
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,640
Hello?

937
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,479
Can you hear me?

938
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,279
Oh, bugger!

939
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,959
Wait a minute

940
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,039
wait wait there.

941
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,759
Please, do you have any money?

942
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,799
I do, and I've a mind to use it

943
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,079
if you would get
the frig out of there!

944
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,560
Oh God.

945
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,119
Look, listen to me,
I'll call you back.

946
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,520
Okay?

947
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,880
Hello?

948
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,560
I'll call you back.

949
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,160
Bugger.

950
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,759
Sorry, America.

951
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,479
Long distance.

952
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,199
You could have walked there
in that time!

953
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,560
I wish he would.

954
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,599
Mr Quinlan?

955
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,080
It's me.

956
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,680
Mr Quinlan?

957
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,079
Bloody hell!

958
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,879
It's 6.30 in the morning!

959
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,799
Please, I need a phone.

960
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,039
It's really urgent.

961
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,119
I found something.

962
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,639
Well, it wasn't your brains,
was it?

963
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,279
Go to hell!

964
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,119
I found a ring!

965
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,279
On the mountain.

966
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,199
A gold ring.

967
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,919
It belonged to one of the crew.

968
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,279
It's got names on it.

969
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,919
I went to the library
and they told me

970
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,639
to call
the Veterans Administration

971
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,959
only I had to keep calling,
and it cost a packet.

972
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,119
And when my granny found out,
she went apeshit.

973
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,319
So, I had to use the phone box
and call America,

974
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,239
but I ran out of money,
and that was last night,

975
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,599
and I have to call her back!

976
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,120
Who?

977
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,600
Ethel.

978
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,799
The name on the ring

979
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,519
You wanna see it?

980
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,319
No, I don't.

981
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,919
I don't want it.

982
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,560
Get out.

983
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,360
Get out!

984
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,439
Mr Quinlan.

985
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,399
Are you all right?

986
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,479
So, you found it.

987
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,999
You stupid bugger!

988
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,839
Doesn't mean a damn thing to you,
but you found it!

989
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,119
And then what do you do?

990
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,999
After 50 years, you just call her
up out of the blue!

991
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,719
"Oh, guess what I've got!"

992
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,519
Well, I thought she'd be pleased.

993
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,279
Only, I was halfway through,
and I ran out of money.

994
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,719
What do you want me
to do about that?

995
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,920
Well, I just wanted to
use your phone.

996
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,480
Get inside

997
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,040
Come on.

998
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,599
I don't believe it!

999
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,359
This is incredible.

1000
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,319
All this stuff.

1001
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,439
Don't touch it.

1002
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,919
This is fantastic!

1003
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,879
Phone is there.

1004
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,120
Go on.

1005
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,680
And be quick.

1006
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,040
Three six nine two?

1007
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,319
Yes, who is it?

1008
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,040
Gander?

1009
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,439
Do you know anyone in Gander?

1010
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,999
Yeah, it's an airbase.

1011
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,400
Teddy!

1012
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,759
Yes, I'll pay!

1013
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,760
Teddy?

1014
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,759
See you Jack.

1015
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,119
Ethel Ann?
No, it's not Teddy, it's Jack.

1016
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,040
Sorry.

1017
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,120
Jack, hi!

1018
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,559
How are you?

1019
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,919
Oh, it's so good to
hear from you.

1020
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,199
Where the heck is Gander?

1021
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,599
Newfoundland.

1022
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,079
Well, what's it like up there?

1023
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,080
Raining.

1024
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,599
Are you on your own?

1025
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,159
No, Chuck got back a week ago.

1026
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,959
He hurt himself,
but he's okay now.

1027
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,319
Hey, you should see me
in my nurse's uniform.

1028
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,359
I'm training to be a nurse.

1029
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,199
Chuck says I look great.

1030
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,919
I bet you do.

1031
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,799
It's so good to hear from you.

1032
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,519
Have you spoken to Teddy?

1033
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,559
Is he okay?

1034
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,199
The last I saw him, he was good,
but I broke my ankle.

1035
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,800
Yeah.

1036
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,479
I was dancing.

1037
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,679
So, I'm coming home on leave.

1038
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,279
Jack, you're crazy!

1039
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,079
He broke his ankle in a dance.

1040
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,279
Hey, can I talk to Chuck?

1041
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah.

1042
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,879
He wants to talk to you.

1043
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,559
But then I wanna talk to
you again, okay?

1044
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,320
Here.

1045
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,360
Thanks.
