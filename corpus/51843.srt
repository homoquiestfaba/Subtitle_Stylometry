1
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,229
After a generation of struggle

2
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,147
changed the face of our nation,

3
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,275
African Americans
entered the '70s

4
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,151
with new found hope.

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,903
- I am...
- I am...

6
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,947
- somebody!
- "somebody!"

7
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,365
Vibrant leaders emerged

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,243
and black culture reached
its high point,

9
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,703
influencing all facets
of American life.

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,538
 Say it louder... 

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,582
 "I'm black and I'm proud" 

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,458
Let me hear you--
 Say it louder... 

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,128
But progress slowed
in the decades that followed.

14
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,714
Black culture began to lose
its distinctive flavor.

15
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,718
And as the millennium
drew to a close,

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,511
disaster struck.

17
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,016
These seemingly random events
were in fact orchestrated

18
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,810
by The Man,
a villain obsessed

19
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,813
with turning back the clock
on race relations.

20
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,773
Just when it seemed
the funky spirit

21
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,609
of the '70s
would be lost forever,

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,237
a new hero emerged.
His name, Undercover Brother.

23
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,200
 "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"
"tear the roof off the mothersucka" 

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
 "Tear the roof off the sucka" 

25
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,913
 "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"
"tear the roof off the mothersucka" 

26
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,873
 "Tear the roof off the sucka" 

27
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,250
 "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"
"tear the roof off the mothersucka" 

28
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,461
 "Tear the roof off the sucka" 

29
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,422
 "Tear the roof off, we're gonna"
"tear the roof off the mothersucka" 

30
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,673
 "Tear the roof off this sucka" 

31
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,635
 You've got a real type
of thang going down 

32
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,303
 Getting down 

33
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,973
 There's a whole lot
of rhythm going round 

34
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,602
 Whoa! We want the funk 

35
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,356
 Give up the funk
Ah, we need the funk... 

36
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,400
Give it to me.
Need it, got to have it.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,486
-  We need the funk 
- We need the funk.

38
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,780
-  "Gotta have the funk" 
- Say!

39
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,157
 La-la-la-ya-ya 

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,161
 Do-do-do-do-do... 

41
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,389
 "Turn this mother out..." 

42
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,643
It ain't no thang.

43
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,437
Yeah.

44
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,277
A bird gonna shit
on my windshield?!

45
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,945
Not on my Cadillac!

46
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,990
I'm gonna chop your
feathers off
and put you in Chinatown!

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,492
They gonna make
Peking Pigeon out of you!

48
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,286
Damn!

49
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,288
Unbeknownst
to Undercover Brother,

50
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,040
there was a secret organization
dedicated to truth,

51
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,251
justice,
and the Afro-American way.

52
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,713
They had never crossed paths
until now.

53
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,816
Headquarters, come in.

54
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,402
Good work, Sistah Girl.

55
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,989
Data from the mainframe
ready to commence.

56
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,992
- She's transmitting!
Are we up and ready?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,203
And I've hacked into
the bank security system.

58
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,873
You've got soul.

59
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,125
- We're in.
- "Aha!"

60
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,296
The computer!
Another idea stolen from the black man.

61
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,590
Did you all know that
George Washington Carver

62
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,926
made the first computer
out of a peanut?

63
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,344
- Hmm?
- A peanut?

64
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,638
- A peanut!
- Shut up and get back to work!

65
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,765
I've spent six months
setting up this operation

66
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,517
and I want
to see everything--

67
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,686
off-shore accounts,
dummy corporations, money laundering.

68
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,105
If we can cut off his funds,

69
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,441
we may finally be able
to stop The Man.

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,451
Waited a long time for this.

71
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,163
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

72
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,916
- What the--
- "Dissed."

73
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,294
- Ah, solid.
- "Hey!"

74
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,046
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

75
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,767
Whoa!
- Headquarters...

76
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,228
- is there another
agent on this case?
- Hell, no!

77
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,855
Damn it, who is that guy?

78
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,983
I'll cross-reference the bank's
security camera with our database.

79
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,158
Come on, Uncle Ben!

80
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,786
Whoa!

81
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,959
Oh, shit!

82
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,211
It's Macy Gray
with pork-chop sideburns!

83
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,676
Who's bad?

84
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,101
Ohh! Right up
the pooper!

85
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,945
- Right on, sweet sistah.

86
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,408
Damn it, who is he?!

87
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,453
- Sistah Girl, abort mission!

88
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,542
Damn it.
Who was that guy?

89
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,427
 "Hey, Undercover" 

90
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,262
-  "Undercover Brother" 
- Solid.

91
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,101
 "Here's the plan--"
"he's got to fight the man" 

92
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,979
 "And he's looking fine"
"when he goes head to head" 

93
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,483
-  "Dig those funky threads" 
-  "Wears his daddy's black"
"medallion" 

94
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,109
 "And it stands for pride" 

95
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,196
 "Truth and justice"
"be your guide" 

96
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,241
-  "He's bad" 
-  "AII he does is good" 

97
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,284
 "He's the Robin Hood"
"of the 'hood" 

98
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,454
 "Hey-hey, Undercover" 

99
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,791
- "Solid."
-  "Undercover Brother" 

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,751
 Dressed to kill
in the Coupe Deville 

101
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,378
 "Oh, hey!" 

102
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,839
-  "Undercover" 
- "Too funky for myself."

103
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,634
-  "Undercover Brother" 
-  "Undercover Brother." 

104
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,135
Yeah.

105
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,873
Mr. Feather, The Man wants to see you.

106
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,666
Fabulous.

107
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,964
And now, the Channel 8 News
with Wendy Marshall

108
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,340
and Chuck Marlboro.

109
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,428
There's growing speculation
that former defense secretary and war
hero,

110
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,014
General Warren Boutwell,
will run for President.

111
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,516
He is considered
the first African-American

112
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,143
with a legitimate chance
of winning.

113
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,146
Wendy?
Yeah, he is a strong
candidate, Chuck.

114
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,023
He's so well-spoken.
I've noticed that.

115
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,234
General Boutwell seems to have
a lot of support all across the nation.

116
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,445
Yes, and not just
in the urban areas.

117
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,199
In fact, the decorated
four-star general and Vietnam vet

118
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,034
is regarded
as one of the country's

119
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,869
most well-respected
public figures.

120
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,204
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,247
A staunch advocate
for civil rights,

122
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,417
Boutwell has never backed down
from controversial issues.

123
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,712
Indeed, if ever
there was a straighter
arrow
than Warren Boutwell,

124
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,547
we'd be hard-pressed
to find him.

125
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,758
Well, if he does declare
his candidacy,

126
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,052
this certainly will be
an exciting race.

127
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,055
Race? I'm not
touching that one.

128
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,391
First, our children hip-hop
all over the suburbs.

129
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,519
Now Boutwell
might be President?!

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,689
They are taking over
every aspect of our culture!

131
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,150
- Don't you agree,
Mr. Feather?
- Word.

132
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,238
- For sheezy, my neezy.
- What did you say?

133
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,949
I said... for sure.

134
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,909
Yes, indeedy.

135
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,953
I have a cold.

136
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,248
I want the White House
to stay white.

137
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,624
Eliminate him!

138
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,752
But, sir,
if we kill him,

139
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,421
we'll only be
making him a hero.

140
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,425
Do you have a better idea?

141
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,928
Our friends
at Multinational lnc.

142
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,596
have been developing
a new drug

143
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,224
with some very
interesting
side effects.

144
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,563
I think we may have found
the perfect guinea pig.

145
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,369
The so called Afro Bandit
struck Multinational Bank.

146
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,580
However, it appears
no money was stolen.

147
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,708
Authorities questioned
singer Macy Gray,

148
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,961
but she was released
for lack of evidence.

149
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,130
Well, would anybody
like to explain exactly

150
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,923
what the hell happened
at the bank?!

151
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,259
His name
is Undercover Brother.

152
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,015
Apparently, he was erasing
mortgage records

153
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,642
so that low-income families
wouldn't lose their homes.

154
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:01,768
Great.

155
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,730
A "Soul Train" reject
with a Robin Hood complex.

156
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,316
- Now I've heard everything.
- Hey, hey, hey, now.

157
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,151
At least he got
the job done.

158
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,613
- That's the kind
of man we need around here.
- The keyword being "man"?

159
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,406
Hold on.
I didn't say that, you did.

160
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,158
Man-man.

161
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,327
The General's
press conference is starting!

162
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,995
We interrupt this broadcast to take you live

163
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,539
to a press conference
by General Warren Boutwell,

164
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,999
in which he is expected
to announce

165
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,169
that he is a candidate
for presidency of the United States.

166
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,047
I wonder if he'll run
as a Democrat or an lndependent.

167
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,675
- Never know.
Might be a Republican.
- Oh, please.

168
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,511
What kind
of self-respecting
black man

169
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,012
would run
as a Republican?

170
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,181
Name one thing
the Republican party

171
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,058
has done
for black people. One!

172
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,060
Well, they were
the party of Lincoln.

173
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,853
They stood against
the tyranny of oppression

174
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,522
by leading the call
for the Civil War,

175
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,233
and forced passage
of the Emancipation Proclamation,

176
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,526
which freed the slaves.

177
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,154
All right,
name two things lately.

178
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,156
Damn it, lt doesn't matter
what party!

179
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,742
This could be the first step
on the road to putting

180
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,036
an African-American
in the White House.

181
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,997
It's a great day
for black people of all races.

182
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,711
"Good morning."
- Think about it!

183
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,048
I've thought long and hard about how
I can best serve my country

184
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,842
now that I'm no longer in uniform.

185
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,010
Well, today...

186
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,179
I am proud to announce

187
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,056
that I will be...

188
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:25,644
opening a chain
of fried chicken restaurants.

189
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,940
General Boutwell!

190
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,026
Yes, sir.

191
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,904
So, you're passing up a chance
to be President

192
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,364
to open a chicken joint?

193
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,409
A man like me doesn't have
any business in politics.

194
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,911
They say you should
always do what you know.

195
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,038
And what I know
is good fried chicken.

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,999
- Ohh...
"Yes, ma'am."

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,127
Don't you think your supporters
in the African-American community

198
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,921
will be particularly disappointed?

199
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,048
Not after they taste
the General's fried chicken.

200
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,719
Surrender, Colonel,
here comes the General.

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,138
- "Will there be side dishes?"
- Sweet potatoes...

202
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,432
- black-eyed peas,

203
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,602
- "mashed potatoes, macaroni..."
- Mmm.

204
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,188
cornbread,
and the General's special...

205
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,940
hot sauce!

206
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,234
That's all for today.

207
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,361
Thank you very much.
Nice to see you all.

208
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,739
General, what about desert?

209
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,037
You know,
he does have a point
about that Colonel.

210
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,580
I never trusted
the Colonel!

211
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,499
Slaves cooked that chicken!
Ain't no white man know

212
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,710
about no 16 herbs
and spices and giblets!

213
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,921
Smart Brother,
if you so damn smart,

214
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,965
- "why don't you explain"
what just happened?

215
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,134
If I wanted to hear something stupid,

216
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,430
- I'd ask this skinny black ass!
- In your face!

217
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,390
Skinny black-- Hey!

218
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,685
We got to find out exactly what happened
to the General, and fast!

219
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,646
I'll get right on it.
Whoa, hold on.

220
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,649
Not that fast. We need
some new blood on this case.

221
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,985
What? Who? You can't just hire
some fool off the streets.

222
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,030
Watch me.
Get me Undercover Brother!

223
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,950
- Ooh, too funky for myself.

224
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,992
You were the only man
outside the palace.

225
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,828
- "I was outside."
- Jimmy!

226
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,122
-But I wasn't the only one.
- "Jim Kelly!"

227
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,751
- It is not possible.
- Watch out for the hand!
Watch out for the hand!

228
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,547
Gets you every time!
Spinning back-kick!

229
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,811
I think I'll lay down

230
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,188
and get me a little bit
of sleep.

231
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,862
Don't touch the hair!

232
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,660
Okay, Bruce Leroy,
turn around.

233
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,537
Slowly.

234
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,042
If you gonna shoot me,

235
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,627
shoot me.

236
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,304
Thank you, Jesus.

237
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,099
Hmm.

238
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,478
Dig it.

239
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,148
You that Sistah Girl
from the bank, huh?

240
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,068
I guess you like
what you saw earlier.

241
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,280
Look, baby,
let's stop fooling
around.

242
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,073
Your body's slammin',
let's get to jammin'.

243
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,617
Excuse me?

244
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,953
Oh, nothing relaxes a brother
after a hard day of going
undercover

245
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,830
Iike a little piece of the cookie.

246
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,001
Goddamn.
My cookie would
break you in half.

247
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:40,672
Maybe, but that would be
some long division.

248
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,509
Long.

249
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,970
You hit me pretty good,
but I wasn't ready.

250
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,682
Now, any time you think
you want to get feisty
or throw down--

251
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,980
So, Sistah Girl,

252
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,483
if you're not here
for Undercover Lover,

253
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,610
you must be here
for Undercover Brother.

254
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,946
What, pray tell,
can I do for you today?

255
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,783
Okay, we're here. Now be cool.

256
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,118
- "This place is top secret."
"Solid."

257
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,955
Man, you know you ain't right.

258
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,332
Whoo-oo!

259
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,251
I'm gonna need
my custom shears

260
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,627
for this masterpiece.

261
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,505
Careful. Puncture him
and the hot air's liable to kill you.

262
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,340
"Take a seat."
- "Don't mind if I do."

263
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,135
- We're gonna hook you right up.
- Holy funkadelic!

264
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,137
This is some kind

265
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,473
of secret organization
you have here.

266
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,851
Look at all this hi-tech
spy equipment.

267
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,938
You got clippers,
you got T.C.B. activator.

268
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,983
I mean, your only competition
must be the K.G.B.

269
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,652
- Or the F.B.I.

270
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,831
Who the hell are you, woman?
You're the Grim Reaper!

271
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,332
I don't want to go to hell!

272
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,293
I ain't never did
nothing but good!

273
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,670
I swear to God
I ain't done nothing wrong!

274
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,264
Oh, come on.

275
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,809
The flashing light and fan
make the drop seem worse than it is.

276
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,150
I knew that.
Mm-hmm.

277
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,946
Entering secure area.

278
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,948
Stand here.

279
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,992
Right here?

280
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,390
Blackness confirmed. You got soul.

281
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,226
What I'm about to show you

282
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,269
few people have ever seen before.

283
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,650
Would Agent Jefferson please pick up
the black courtesy phone?

284
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,739
Agents report
to the ready room.

285
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,783
Agents report
to the ready room.

286
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,745
Welcome
to the Brotherhood.

287
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,622
Solid.

288
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,584
Yes, I know.

289
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,671
I really don't want to talk about this
over the telephone.

290
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,048
Perhaps we could meet
at a secret location?

291
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,717
Okay. No, that sounds great.

292
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,220
All right. Revolution.
Take care.

293
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,222
"The revolution will not be televised. "

294
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,767
- This is Undercover Brother.
- Hey, how you doing?

295
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,103
Good morning!

296
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,939
Good morning?
Get on the desk!

297
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,275
You brought
a spy around me?!

298
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,694
Spy in the building!

299
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,571
- Don't touch the 'fro.
- Back up off!

300
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,575
- Back up off "me!"
- Let me tell you something
about the word "good."

301
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,619
Good is an ancient
Anglo-Saxon word.

302
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,998
Go-od, meaning
the absence of color,

303
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,916
i.e.--
"It's all good,"

304
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,586
which it is,
or "Good Will Hunting,"

305
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,921
meaning,
"I'm hunting niggas!"

306
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,091
So if you say "good morning" to me,
you're saying,

307
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,469
"I'm gonna kill your black ass
first thing in the morning!"

308
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,097
- "Is that that damn Undercover Brother?!"
- You in trouble.

309
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,099
- Where the hell have you been?!
- Hey.

310
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,226
This is a job, not some kind
of damn summer camp!

311
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,103
And I'm tired of you
disrespecting me!

312
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,773
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire your sorry ass!

313
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,776
Because I don't work for you?

314
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,445
Shut up!

315
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,448
Save your smart comments
for the chunky brother in the smock!

316
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,491
Now get in my office!

317
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,471
Congratulations, Mr. Feather.

318
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,306
Thank you, Mister...

319
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,225
The Man.

320
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:05,395
As you can see,
the General is totally under our control.

321
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:09,900
Yes, our little experiment was a success.

322
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:14,905
In fact, I've decided to use the General
to launch "Operation Whitewash."

323
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,408
Fabulous. I'll inform Multinational
to step up production.

324
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,745
The only thing standing
in our way is the Brotherhood.

325
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,249
And they won't be a problem,
will they, Feather?

326
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,376
No, sir.

327
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,627
Good.

328
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,298
Uh, will they, Feather?

329
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,181
- "New one from Britney--"

330
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,484
 "Oh-oh" 

331
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,242
 "Ooo-mmm" 

332
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,583
 "Let's get it crunk upon,"
"have fun upon" 

333
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,418
 "Up in this dancery" 

334
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,254
 "We got ya open, now ya floatin'" 

335
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,423
 "So you gots to dance for me" 

336
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,758
 "Come on, everybody, get on up" 

337
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,303
 "'Cause you know we got"
"to get it crunk" 

338
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,014
- What am I doing?!

339
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,735
And that's why we believe
there's got to be

340
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,614
some connection between
the General's announcement and The Man.

341
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,366
Come on, y'all.
Y'all telling me there's really "a" Man?

342
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,661
What do you think,
Undercover Brother?

343
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,288
If that is your real name.

344
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,582
You think things
just happen by accident?

345
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,668
No! Sometimes people,

346
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,671
mostly white people,
make things happen.

347
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,298
That's where we come in

348
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,677
and our never ending struggle
against The Man,

349
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,805
a.k.a. Whitey,
a.k.a. Mr. Charlie,

350
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,767
a.k.a. Honky McGee.

351
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,769
So, the conspiracies we've believed

352
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,271
for all these years are really true?

353
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,273
The N.B.A. really instituted

354
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,568
the three-point shot
to give white boys a chance?

355
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,861
Absolutely.

356
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,489
So the entertainment industry
really "is" out to get Spike Lee.

357
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,991
- Is that right?
- Come on, man!

358
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,952
Even Cher got an Oscar.

359
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,495
Cher-rr!

360
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,414
And O.J. really
didn't do it?

361
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,420
Let's just move on,
shall we?

362
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,007
Holy moly, looks like
the Source Awards in here.

363
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,009
Ow!
It does now.

364
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,053
- Hurting.
- Who's that?

365
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,055
Oh, this is Lance, our intern.

366
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,682
Lance, this is
Undercover Brother.

367
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,225
What's happening?

368
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,603
Whas-ssup?!

369
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,357
Okay, how did
the white boy get a job

370
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,109
here at the Brotherhood?

371
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,945
Shit. What can I tell you?
Affirmative action.

372
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,572
What? Here we go.

373
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,115
Oh, boy.
Open up the window.

374
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,367
It's getting all racial
up in this piece.

375
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,288
Look here,
Undercover Brother,

376
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,914
now that
you're working for us,

377
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,208
you're gonna need to memorize
our rules and regulations.

378
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,128
Trim the hair, and for God's sake,
get rid of the clothes.

379
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,422
Slow your roll, Chief.
You know, I respect

380
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,549
what y'all are doing here
at the Brotherhood,

381
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,219
but I'm a firm believer
in everybody should do their own
thang.

382
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,764
 What a boy wants,
what a boy needs 

383
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,558
 Whatever... 

384
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,187
 Free... 

385
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,566
Okay, he should never
do his own thang.

386
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,696
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

387
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,161
I said, "You'd better open
the bank and give me my money."

388
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,537
Yeah?
"It's my money.

389
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,372
I don't care whose bank it is!"
Right.

390
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,000
I know whose money is
in it.
I'm keeping it real.

391
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,503
- That's all I'm saying.
- Hi, Conspiracy Brother.

392
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,254
"Hi"?
What you mean, "Hi"?

393
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,340
Like, "Hi, y'all
want to be white?"

394
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,009
High, like the white man
wants to keep us? Huh?

395
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,429
You don't smell
no weed on me, did you?

396
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,473
Hey, brother, can I get a list

397
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,475
of the words
that trigger these fits?

398
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,101
Man, you really need
to relax.

399
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,770
- Go see a movie.
- A movie?

400
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,522
A movie.
Come on, man!

401
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,774
So I can fall in love
with some cute black man

402
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,443
that teaches white people everything
they know about the shrimp industry

403
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,320
before they kill him
30 minutes into the movie?

404
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,490
"Hey, why don't you walk down
that tunnel, black man?

405
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,700
Hey, black man,
turn on the generator.

406
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,286
This dinosaur is out there.
Hey, black man, look out.

407
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,622
- He's got a gun!"

408
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,415
Oh! I'm hit!

409
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,417
But my vest caught it, bitch!

410
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,044
Yes, I'm alive!

411
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,714
I told you to keep your finger
off the trigger of that thing!

412
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,132
I'm cool, everybody.

413
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,801
- Undercover Brother, please.
- "Go on back to work."

414
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:47,553
- Sorry about all that.
- "I shit on myself!"

415
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,137
I have a couple
of things for you.

416
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:53,058
Here are your shoes.
I took the liberty of making
a few modifications.

417
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,518
Whoo!

418
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,145
And now, am I correct
in assuming that the
Cadillac

419
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,481
that was double-parked
in the parking lot belongs to you?

420
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,276
Smart Brother,
that is not just a Caddy.

421
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,278
That is a Cadillac
Coupe DeVille.

422
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:07,155
Y'all don't give a shit about me!
I need a sponge bath.

423
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,784
That's an orange soda dispenser.

424
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:13,537
And a crossover amp
and subwoofer for your eight-track.

425
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,582
Ah, man. Smart Brother,
you's a bad mother--

426
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,168
- Shut your mouth!

427
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,961
Enjoy, huh?

428
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,337
All right.

429
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,465
Big car, big hair, big necklace.

430
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,218
Someone is clearly
overcompensating.

431
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,847
First of all, you forgot about
my big, black, fuzzy balls.

432
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,771
And secondly,
this is not a necklace,

433
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,857
it's a medallion
given to me by my father

434
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,651
so I never forget who I am
or what I stand for.

435
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,528
I don't need no gold.
Don't need no jewels.

436
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,573
- The medallion
keeps me cool. You dig?

437
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,159
"Sistah Girl,"
Undercover Brother, come in.

438
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,331
What it is, Chief?

439
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,458
We've just discovered
that the General is playing golf

440
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,335
with some of Multinational's
head honchos.

441
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,671
Now, you get yo ass down there
and see what you can find out!

442
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,381
And by the way,
Undercover Screw Up,

443
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,051
don't let me catch your black ass
in the news again.

444
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,136
You hear me?!
I want you to blend in!

445
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,597
Chiefie, baby,
I'm a master of disguises.

446
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,225
I can blend in like a good weave.

447
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,441
- "Say, where's that caddy?"
- "I don't know."

448
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,151
Oh, there he is.

449
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,988
Uh... um--

450
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,740
Jah mon, rasta.

451
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,793
- "Nice shot."

452
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,095
Sistah Girl,
the camera's up.

453
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,103
Would anyone like
some fried chicken?

454
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,439
- Mm-mmm.

455
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,614
Mr. Feather.

456
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,324
Undercover Brother?

457
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,326
We're definitely
on the right track.

458
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,121
That's the number one
flunkey of The Man.

459
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,665
I'm gonna report to the Chief,
find out what he wants to do.

460
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,168
That cat'll be long gone
by that time.

461
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,044
This thing's
going down now, baby.

462
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,255
This is strictly
an observational mission.

463
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,007
We are not authorized
to take action.

464
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,133
Well, observe this.

465
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,178
Action is what
Undercover Brother's all about.

466
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,308
Hmm. Rasta man.

467
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:53,655
Oh, the mind control
formula is complete.

468
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,326
- "Who's there?"
- "Kung!"

469
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,328
Kung who?

470
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,208
Kung fool!

471
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,558
Ow, my wrist.

472
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,063
Help! Thief!
There's a thief here!

473
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,815
- What the hell is your problem?
- Give me back my things!

474
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:31,652
Thief!
Hey, give me that back!

475
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,653
Hey!

476
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,449
Hold it!

477
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,993
Holy Motown.

478
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,087
- Come on.
- You don't want
to mess with me, man!

479
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,014
I had 'em, baby.
Yeah, I saw.

480
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,766
Come on, let's go!

481
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,854
Come on!

482
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,400
Stop where you are!
This is security!

483
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,944
- Do not move!
- Quick! This way!

484
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,571
Aw, hell, they moved.

485
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,286
Do it.
Code 37.

486
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,880
Oh-oh!

487
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,592
- Is he crazy?
- Okay, slow down!

488
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,638
- "Slow, slow, slow."

489
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,974
Hey, slow down
over there, people!

490
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,978
Hold the wheel, baby.

491
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,983
- No! No!
- Oh, no!

492
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,319
Oh, jeez!
Too fast!

493
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,154
Losing control!

494
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,809
- There's got to be
another way out of here.
- "Hold it!"

495
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,204
Thanks for the lift.

496
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,501
A spectral analysis
has ironically
confirmed

497
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,962
traces of poultry
on Mr. Feather.

498
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,880
This proves that
The Man must be behind

499
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:59,007
Multinational lnc.'s deal
with the General.

500
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,718
I don't get it.
What does The Man
got to do with fried chicken?

501
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,471
Is that his big plan,
to get black people to eat junk food?

502
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,849
Open your eyes,
Undercover Brother!

503
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,394
This has to do with
discrediting the General.

504
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,396
That is
the white man's
tactic.

505
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,398
He don't want
no black President.

506
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,858
You've seen it
all through history.

507
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,818
They never give
black men credit.

508
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,821
Jesus Christ...
black man.

509
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:24,700
Babe Ruth...
black man.

510
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,369
Madonna!

511
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,330
Sleeps with black men.

512
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,541
Think about it.

513
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,710
So the General
sold out to The Man.

514
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,545
I don't think
it's that simple.

515
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,631
When you're dealing
with The Man, it never is.

516
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:45,012
Our only choice here
is to infiltrate Multinational lnc.

517
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,639
Then we can find out
what happened to the General.

518
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,350
It'll be a very
dangerous assignment.

519
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,520
It'll be your most
vigorous training yet.

520
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,230
You're gonna have to think and act

521
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,691
just like a tight-butt white man
with a 401K plan

522
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,359
and a country club membership.

523
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,320
So pay attention.

524
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,659
Here...

525
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,995
have a bite of this...

526
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,246
sandwich.

527
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:13,123
How did you
know
I was hungry?

528
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,000
I ain't eat nothing
this morning.

529
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,216
- You trying to kill me?
- If you're going to pass
in white America,

530
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,302
you are going to have
to learn to like mayonnaise!

531
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:26,553
No!
Listen...

532
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:29,640
if you're ever forced
to eat this mayonnaise,

533
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,351
simply press the button
on this side of the watch.

534
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,020
It delivers a rather liberal
spritzing of hot sauce.

535
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:38,357
One blast should be enough
to make Caucasian food edible.

536
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,942
Well, it works on grits.

537
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,613
Now, since time
is of the essence,

538
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:46,657
I developed a device
that allows you

539
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,742
to absorb the whole
of white culture

540
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,703
in mere seconds
using subliminal imagery.

541
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,121
I call it...

542
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,083
Caucasiavision.

543
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,919
Hey, I feel like George Clinton.

544
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,588
 We want the funk. 

545
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,132
- Turn it on.

546
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,428
 Here we go one more time 

547
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,722
 "Everybody's feeling fine" 

548
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,267
-  "Here we go now" 
-  "Yes, yes, here we go" 

549
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,727
-  "'N Sync has got to flow..." 
- No!

550
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,730
 "Get to the beat,"
"we've got everything you need..." 

551
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:20,148
Make it stop!
Make it stop!

552
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,733
 "Yes, here we go..." 

553
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,487
Don't you
give up on me!

554
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,824
I see white people.
It's too much!

555
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,158
Too much!
Caucasian overload!

556
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,828
Caucasian overload.
Breathe.

557
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,496
Caucasian overload!
Breathe.

558
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,000
Breathe. Breathe.

559
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,838
That's too much white
for one brother to take.

560
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,214
You did good.

561
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,425
We need to make sure
the process worked,

562
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:50,679
so I called in an expert
on white culture.

563
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,527
"In season three
of 'Friends,'

564
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:12,242
what object of Julia's
did Ross see on his bedside table

565
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,286
the night
he kissed Rachel?"

566
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,504
Her saline solution.

567
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,091
He's ready.

568
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,521
Hi, there.

569
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:43,857
How are you doing?

570
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,694
What do you say there?

571
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,280
Howdy.
May I help you?

572
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,823
I sincerely hope so.

573
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,825
Today's my first day
at Multinational.

574
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:56,161
Oh, my.
Jackson.

575
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:57,663
Anton Jackson.

576
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:59,915
And no, not one
of the Jackson Five.

577
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,587
Here we go.
You're in suite 54.
Tobacco division.

578
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,923
We need some fresh,

579
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:11,093
hip strategies to expand
our market share.

580
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,637
As it turns out,
I have just the product.

581
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,432
Here's one
of your cigarettes.

582
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:18,767
Take a good look at
it.

583
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,603
It's pale, small,
a little on the limp side.

584
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,980
It's basically inadequate.

585
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,190
It can't possibly give much
pleasure to the user.

586
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,776
- It sure can't.
- I mean, ask yourselves,

587
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,028
how many black people
are gonna want to smoke this?

588
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,281
- Not the one I know.
- "You have to effectively position"

589
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,324
your product
within the black consumer.

590
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,119
May I present to you
The Fatty?

591
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:41,206
Hmm? It's got that
hand-rolled look and feel

592
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,625
that's so popular
with today's black youth.

593
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,629
It's big. It's full
of long-lasting pleasure

594
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,048
- to be enjoyed again...

595
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,388
I could use a smoke.

596
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,807
Yeah? Good.

597
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:05,105
It's time to say goodbye
to Anton Jackson...

598
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,112
and say what it is
to Undercover Brother.

599
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,241
Whee-hee!

600
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,160
Now, that's
a long way down.

601
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,858
Hey!

602
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,429
Come in, Brotherhood.
Are you digging me?

603
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,056
Undercover Brother.

604
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,392
I'll transmit some
computer files about the General.

605
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,477
- See what you can do with it.
Right on."

606
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,487
The chief wants you to stay undercover
until we decode this information.

607
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,489
- I can dig it.
- But be careful.

608
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,658
If they're onto you,
they might set up a trap.

609
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,285
I know this
is the wrong time,

610
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,120
but I wanted to let
you know,

611
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:45,080
I'm thinking about you, girl.

612
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,457
I'm bouncin'.
Shakin' a spot.

613
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,751
- Gone.
- Bye.

614
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,920
Bye.

615
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,549
Mr. Elias,
there's been a breach!

616
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,926
That afro!

617
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,053
I'd recognize it
anywhere.

618
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,431
The Brotherhood
is making their move.

619
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,391
Just as I expected.

620
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,562
It's time to release
our secret weapon.

621
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:11,231
I call it...

622
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:14,443
Black Man's kryptonite.

623
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,612
 "I want to be bad" 

624
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,239
 "Make that look so good" 

625
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,950
 "I've got things on my mind" 

626
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,953
 "I never thought I would" 

627
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,456
 "I want to be bad" 

628
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,958
 "You make me feel so good" 

629
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,128
- "I'm losing all my cool..." 
- How's it going there?

630
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,880
What the hell?

631
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:37,508
Oh, dear.

632
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:40,469
Oh, what am I gonna do?

633
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:42,471
My gosh.

634
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,808
Look at this mess.
Oh, dear.

635
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,812
I'm so sorry.
Let me help you.

636
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,439
Jeez, that's sweet of you.

637
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,483
If I mess up my boss' report,

638
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,985
he's gonna have a conniption
with a capital K.

639
00:37:57,027 --> 00:38:00,906
- Oh.
- Penelope Snow.

640
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,742
Anton Jackson.

641
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,744
I'm so sorry. Here.

642
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,789
Thanks, Anton.
You're so sweet.

643
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:12,417
And cute, too.
In a Theo Huxtable kind of way.

644
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,587
Are you new here?

645
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,006
Yeah, it's my first day.
Mine too.

646
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,925
- Really?
- Yeah, I just moved here

647
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,927
bringing nothing by my hopes
and my dreams.

648
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,972
But sometimes the big city
can be so...

649
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,933
...big.

650
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:31,520
A girl needs friends, Anton.

651
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,814
Would you like to be my friend?

652
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,198
 "We all know" 

653
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,370
 "That people are the same"
"wherever you go" 

654
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,540
 There is good and bad 

655
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,542
 "In everyone..." 

656
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:54,710
Hey.

657
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:57,921
 When we learn
to live 

658
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,549
 We learn to
give
each other 

659
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:03,760
 What we need
to survive 

660
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:06,638
 Together alive 

661
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,768
 Ebony and ivory 

662
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:17,274
 Live together
in perfect harmony 

663
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:22,779
 Side by side
on my piano keyboard 

664
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,198
 Oh, Lord 

665
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,702
 Why don't we? 

666
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,746
- Yeah!

667
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:37,669
Yeah!

668
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,301
 Ivory 

669
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,429
 Ebony 
 Oh-oh 

670
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,057
 Ivory 

671
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,392
 Ebony. 

672
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,436
I didn't know you had such
a beautiful voice.

673
00:39:55,646 --> 00:40:00,108
You know, you and I
have tons in common.

674
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,945
I know what it feels like
to be discriminated against.

675
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:06,448
I mean, just because a girl
has a healthy sexual appetite,

676
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,408
doesn't mean
she can't do her job.

677
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,078
- Uh-huh.
- They look at you

678
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,956
and all they see
is a threatening black man.

679
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,876
And they look at me,
and all they see

680
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:20,462
are my full breasts
and my narrow waist

681
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,256
that tapers
to my pert backside.

682
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,633
It's just not fair.
Huh-uh.

683
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,010
- Here you go, folks.
- Yum.

684
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,599
- And here's the extra
mayonnaise you ordered.
- Yum, yum.

685
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,477
- "Enjoy."
- This is the best stuff.

686
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,731
Have you eaten
here before, Anton?

687
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,733
No, I haven't.
It's my first time.

688
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,610
Oh, take a bite
of my sandwich.

689
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,447
Come on, Anton.

690
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:50,617
Just one little bite.

691
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,004
Scrumptious.

692
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,551
Oh, Anton,

693
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,721
I can't wait to see you
in these corduroys.

694
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,806
You're gonna
make me blush.

695
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:15,350
And you might not see it!

696
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,853
May I help you, sir?

697
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,648
Hello, fellow person of color.

698
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,400
How's it going today?

699
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,905
- What's going down?
- What are you doing
with that girl?

700
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:29,489
- What girl?
- That girl!

701
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:31,325
- Oh, the white woman.
- Mm-hmm.

702
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:32,993
I'm undercover.

703
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,913
When you go undercover, you have
to do things you wouldn't normally do.

704
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,789
No matter how difficult,
how dangerous,

705
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:39,708
how good it might have felt.

706
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,711
Like having sex with white girls?

707
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,005
Damn it, woman,
would you just back off?!

708
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:49,009
Attention angry black man in khakis.

709
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,054
Golly, I must have tripped
or something.

710
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,515
Hi, Ton-ja.

711
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:56,850
Listen...

712
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:00,187
I was wondering,
do you have any dickies?

713
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:01,772
'Cause I couldn't
find them.

714
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:03,482
Really?
Mm-hmm.

715
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:06,443
Perhaps we're all "sold out."

716
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:08,445
Aw, that's too bad.

717
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,030
Come on, Anton.

718
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,741
I saw a mock turtleneck
at Eddie Bauer

719
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,410
that's perfect for you.

720
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:18,080
Thanks for all your help.
Bye-bye, Ton-ja.

721
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,831
Bye-bye.

722
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,093
And action!

723
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,345
I want you...

724
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:37,182
to buy my new
fried chicken, that is.

725
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,811
Sure enough.

726
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,646
I used to work
for the Pentagon,

727
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:44,815
now I help you to get
your chicken on.

728
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,650
And for a limited time only,

729
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:48,652
order an eight-piece
Nappy Meal,

730
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:52,489
and get a 32-ounce
malt liquor absolutely free.

731
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:55,158
-  You be buyin' 
-  "Yeah, yeah" 

732
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,578
-  We be frying 
- Woo-woo!

733
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,246
 "General's chicken" 

734
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:01,290
 "The best chicken"
"in the 'hood" 

735
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,958
 Yeah, yeah 

736
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,794
-  Legs, breasts and thighs 
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:08,380
 "Sweet potato pies" 

738
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:11,592
-  "General's Fried Chicken" 
"Lord have mercy."

739
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,468
 "General's Fried Chicken" 

740
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,138
 "It's butt kickin'" 

741
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,639
 "General's Fried" 

742
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,308
 "You know it tastes so good" 

743
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:23,145
Introducing the Nappy Meal from G.F.C.

744
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,647
This chicken is the bomb.

745
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,986
At the General's,
we do chicken right-on!

746
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,448
Will you look at that?

747
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,492
The General's lost
his damn mind.

748
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,661
He's making a fool
out of himself over this crap.

749
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,830
 "General's Fried Chicken" 

750
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,790
 "It's butt kickin'" 

751
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,626
 Hey, hey 

752
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,171
What?
It's catchy.

753
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:51,006
Reminds me
of the Fresh Prince.

754
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,633
I like him.
He raps happy.

755
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:56,178
Excuse me, sir.
This is a restricted-- good
God!

756
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,764
- Heya, Chiefster. Lance.
- Nice pants.

757
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,266
- Undercover Brother?
- Undercover Brother?

758
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:05,145
- What happened to you?
- He had sex with a white girl,
that's what!

759
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:07,439
Was it everything
I dreamed of?
It was good.

760
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,149
She had pink nipples?
Big ones.

761
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,360
- Yeah, big ones.
- Yeah.

762
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,904
"Her carpet"
matched her drapes?
Excuse me?

763
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:20,369
- No, man.
You can't be doing that.
- What were you doing?

764
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,830
- White girl or no white girl,
where the hell have you been?
- Not there,

765
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:26,625
'cause that's where people who swear go.
Thank you very much.

766
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,961
You sound like
a 14-year-old white chick.

767
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,922
I don't think so, Sister Girl.

768
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:35,008
It's Sistah Girl, "dude."

769
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,219
Maybe on Planet Ebonics.
But where I come from,

770
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,596
we like to pronounce
our E's and our R's,

771
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:41,390
thank you very much.

772
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:43,976
E's and R's?

773
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:46,186
Ebonics, huh?
I be thinking

774
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:49,565
that somebody in this room
is selling out.

775
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,441
I say we kill him.
Shut the door, nigga.

776
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,610
Shh, it's gonna be
all right, baby. Don't look!

777
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,904
I'm sorry, dawg,
but you need--
Hey, buddy,

778
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:59,491
if I hadn't read that article in "Vanity Fair"
on anger management,

779
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:02,494
I'd put away this guava-
mango-broccoli smoothie

780
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:05,038
- and put my foot
in your patootie.
- Patootie?

781
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,999
Now maybe you guys
don't like the new me,

782
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,001
but I don't give a gosh darn.

783
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,294
For all I care,

784
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,254
you can all get
the beejeebies out of here.

785
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:14,590
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must be going.

786
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,133
"Frasier" is on.

787
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:18,343
"Frasier"?

788
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:24,057
Beejeebies?

789
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,059
He said he would stick his foot

790
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,854
up my so-called "patootie."
Damn it.

791
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,522
I knew this could happen.

792
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:33,817
You can only keep
an agent undercover for so long

793
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:35,277
before he loses his identity.

794
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:39,323
Hell, no man can resist
low interest loans

795
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:41,491
and non-fat lattes forever.

796
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,118
And white women.

797
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,912
So wait,
let me get this straight.

798
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,455
Whenever a black guy does well,

799
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:49,124
starts wearing Dockers,
buys a few Celine Dion records,

800
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,751
and sleeps with a white chick,

801
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,127
you automatically
say he's sold out?

802
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:53,462
That's enough!

803
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:56,840
Always trying to shut
the white man down.

804
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,051
That's right!
That's right!

805
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:02,095
- Oh, that ain't right.
"What's the word?"

806
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:04,932
I was able to decode
the data from Multinational lnc.

807
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,558
The General is under
the influence

808
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,228
of a psycho-
hallucinogenic drug.

809
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,563
It's a mind control drug, sir.
Very powerful.

810
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,398
Very easy to use.

811
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:16,276
Good Lord.

812
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,364
With something like that,
The Man could control every
black person in America.

813
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:23,951
Theoretically, yes, but it would take years
to administer the doses individually.

814
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,869
To be efficient,
you'd need to develop

815
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,871
a huge distribution system.

816
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,168
The chicken!

817
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,423
I hate to say it,

818
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,635
if Undercover Brother
don't get his shit together,

819
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:44,137
this may be one battle
we might lose to The Man.

820
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:50,227
Smart Brother,
am I gonna die?

821
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,479
 "Dumps like a truck--"
"truck, truck" 

822
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:54,481
 "AII night long" 

823
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:59,278
 "Let me see that thong" 

824
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,239
Honey?
Yeah?

825
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:05,200
Is this Michael Bolton's
version of that "thong song?"

826
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:07,119
No, but I want that one.

827
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,789
I hear he got all the funk
that Sisqo missed.

828
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,291
Do you like this?

829
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,459
You know, usually I'm not
into the heavy stuff,

830
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,628
but this is kinda catchy.

831
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,338
It is, isn't it?
Yeah.

832
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:23,385
- I made us some sandwiches.
- Extra mayo for me, please.

833
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:33,312
Freeze, sucka!

834
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,314
Put down
the mayonnaise...

835
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,690
slowly.

836
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,442
It's that colored girl,
Ton-ja.

837
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:47,784
Now, Buffy the Black Man Slayer,
step away from the brotha.

838
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,745
- Bye, brother.
- Come on.

839
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,747
- Bye.
- "Move it."

840
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,249
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

841
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,586
Why? So you can tell me
what a sellout I am again?

842
00:47:57,628 --> 00:47:59,630
Oh, I don't judge people
by how they dress,

843
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,715
or what music
they listen to.

844
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:04,760
But I remember a brother
who wasn't afraid to be himself,

845
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,638
who taught me to follow
my own funky path,

846
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,973
stand up for
what I think is right.

847
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,935
Remember this?

848
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:17,814
Ignore her, Anton.

849
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:21,193
I'm all the single white female
you'll ever need.

850
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,613
I want to. Really, I do.

851
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,491
All day, but I can't.

852
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,538
I must be true to myself.

853
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,040
Look at that white girl.
Are you crazy?

854
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:37,292
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

855
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,753
Corduroys
are so comfortable.

856
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:42,339
Got to get funky.

857
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,509
 Hey, macarena,
all right! 

858
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:59,690
I can't throw this away.

859
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:01,650
'Cause like this medallion...

860
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:04,653
this brother's here to stay.

861
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:08,824
What's up, Sistah Girl?
Look at you!

862
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:11,243
What took you so long?

863
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:14,288
- You don't think
the heels are too much?
- No, it's funktabulous.

864
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,123
- 'Cause I was gonna go--
- "Hold it right there..."

865
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:18,625
Undercover Brother.
Drop it!

866
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:22,546
- This woman just can't get--
- I meant the gun.

867
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:37,311
That's White She-Devil,

868
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,521
The Man's secret weapon.

869
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:41,231
Sorry.

870
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:46,612
It's time to...

871
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,572
platform out of here.

872
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:57,998
Damn duck shoes.

873
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,167
Looks like
we're in hot water.

874
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:03,253
Or hot sauce.

875
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:09,718
Come on!
Come on.

876
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,094
Come on.
It's not fair.

877
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,930
'N Sync!

878
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,431
Backstreet Boys!

879
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,850
And Boyz Il Men!
We really sing!

880
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,144
Elton John!
Billie Jean King!

881
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,188
 "Look at her" 

882
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:23,398
 "She's a bad mama jama" 

883
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:27,861
 "Just as fine as she can be" 

884
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,698
 "She's a bad mama jama..." 

885
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,618
Come on, White She-Devil.
I been waiting.

886
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,078
Come on, baby.
Come on!

887
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:42,125
 "Her body measurements are perfect"
"in every dimension" 

888
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,921
 "She's got a figure"
"that's gonna bring attention" 

889
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:48,340
 "She's poetry in motion" 

890
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,259
 "A beautiful sight to see" 

891
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,887
 "I get so excited"
"viewing her anatomy" 

892
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:57,724
 "She's built--"
"oh, she's dynamic..." 

893
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:00,269
- No, you didn't.
- "Yes, I did."

894
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,440
Bitch!

895
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,484
You know how much
this shit cost?

896
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:09,319
How much did this shit cost,
you disco queen?!

897
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:11,822
- All of this!
- How dare you!

898
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:18,328
Hey!

899
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,581
Touch it. Now looky here.

900
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,381
Whew! Whew, baby!

901
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,633
Toast to the booty!
Booty toast.

902
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:34,928
Oh, yeah!

903
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,307
Wait! Look at that.

904
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:40,767
 "...She's mighty mighty,"
"just letting it all hang out" 

905
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:44,271
 "She's a brickhouse" 

906
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,608
 "The lady's stacked,"
"and that's a fact" 

907
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:49,818
-  "Ain't holding nothing back" 

908
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,238
 "Ow, she's a brickhouse..." 

909
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,990
The water's cold.
Water cold!

910
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,034
 "Now we're together,"
"everybody knows" 

911
00:51:57,576 --> 00:51:58,493
 "This is how the story goes..." 

912
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:01,830
Nothin' like safe sex,
you know what I'm saying?

913
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:05,876
Look at that.
Look at that there.

914
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:06,877
Bitch!

915
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:17,221
You enjoy yourself?

916
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,661
Would you stop
fooling around?

917
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,831
Got to get my cool back!

918
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,640
Can you play something funky
for a brother to drive to?

919
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,065
Drive!
Drive this thing!

920
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:12,025
Baby, it was made
in the '70s.

921
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,277
This ain't no Ferrari.

922
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:22,244
 "Jungle boogie" 

923
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,413
 "Jungle boogie" 

924
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:26,582
 "Jungle boogie" 

925
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:27,833
 "Jungle boogie..." 

926
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,586
Damn.
Look out, baby.

927
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:48,645
 "Jungle boogie" 
 "Get up with the get down" 

928
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,606
 "Jungle boogie" 

929
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:53,775
-  "Jungle boogie" 
-  "Oh yeah" 

930
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,069
 "Jungle boogie..." 

931
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,456
You should have run
her narrow ass over.

932
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,094
So, this has all been
some kind of jive game

933
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:23,055
- to get me out of the way?
- "That's right."

934
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,098
I was sent to destroy you

935
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,059
and everything
the Brotherhood stands for.

936
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:40,447
Damn it.

937
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:44,743
Falling in love with you
wasn't part of the plan.

938
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,330
Mmm.

939
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,378
Oh, Undercover Brother,

940
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:57,130
you're too much man for me.

941
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:58,674
Baby...

942
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:02,219
sometimes I'm too much man
for my own damn self.

943
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:09,476
Mr. Feather,
your status report, please.

944
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:12,563
All the pieces
of Operation Whitewash
are in place.

945
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,898
Good. It's time
to extend the reach

946
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,359
to black leaders
in sports, the arts,

947
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,194
entertainment and business.

948
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:21,697
Soon all aspects of society

949
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,866
will once again be dominated
by The Man.

950
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:26,243
It's time to strike
the final blow

951
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,911
against the Brotherhood.

952
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,330
So, when I return to the lair,

953
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:33,542
Undercover Brother
better be dead.

954
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:35,836
- Are we clear?
- "Very good, sir."

955
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:37,379
With Undercover
Brother dead,

956
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,256
the Brotherhood
had best step correct,

957
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:42,050
or their next move
will be their last.

958
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,386
Goodbye.

959
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:50,267
Can I ask you something?

960
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:52,311
Did I just say,

961
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:54,438
"They had best
step correct"?

962
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,398
Yes, sir. You did.

963
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:58,859
You see what's happening?

964
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,944
You see how we're
being corrupted by their

965
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,030
hip-and-now fashion,
and their cool slang

966
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,199
you can't help but use.
"Don't be dissing me!"

967
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,909
- No!
- "It's all that!"

968
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,204
You go, girl!
What's the dillio?

969
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,581
Who let the dogs out?
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

970
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:14,249
Whatcha talk about,
Willis?

971
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,126
- You know
what I'm saying?!
- Uh...

972
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:17,961
Little by little we're blending

973
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,755
and merging until one day

974
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:21,882
we're all going to be
one united people

975
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:24,676
Iiving and working
and dancing together,

976
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:28,347
Iike the news or "AIly McBeal,"
or the people that work
at Saturn!

977
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:31,099
And we've got to stop it
before it's too late!

978
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:35,812
You heard The Man.
As of now,

979
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:40,609
Operation Whitewash
goes global.

980
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:50,744
Jay-Z is doing Lawrence Welk's
Greatest Hits?!

981
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:53,956
John Singleton to remake
"Driving Miss Daisy"?!

982
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:57,960
Terry McMillan?
"How Stella Got Her
White Man Back"?

983
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,795
Double damn it!

984
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:02,464
Black people all over
the world are losing their damn minds.

985
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,966
And look--

986
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:07,594
they've all been exposed
to the General's fried chicken.

987
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:09,304
Smart Brother, how's it coming
with this antidote?

988
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:12,641
I found one.
But it only works on
one person at a time.

989
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:14,810
We have to stop
this thing at the source.

990
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,813
Undercover Brother,
you're back!

991
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:24,820
Hi.

992
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:27,698
Hell's wrong with you bringing
a white girl in my house?

993
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:29,491
She's working
with us now, Chief.

994
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:32,160
With my extensive
and intimate knowledge

995
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:33,704
of The Man's organization,

996
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,831
I can help you stop his evil plan.

997
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:37,457
Okay.

998
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,169
Smart Brother,
take White She-Devil to the lab

999
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,837
and find out exactly
what she knows.

1000
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:45,048
You know, you're cute in
a Theo Huxtable kind of way.

1001
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,509
Really? Usually
I get Al Roker.

1002
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,179
"Here's what's happening
in your neck of the woods."

1003
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,764
Chief,
various brother agents,

1004
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:55,559
I owe all of you
a huge apology.

1005
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:58,103
I just watched this show...

1006
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:00,147
"Roots"?
Maybe you've heard of it?

1007
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:04,193
It taught me such
a profound lesson about bigotry.

1008
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:07,112
I have sat on the sidelines
of race relations long enough.

1009
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:10,949
I want to march down
that field of oppression

1010
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,452
and kick that ball of bigotry

1011
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:15,454
right over the goalpost

1012
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,497
of intolerance.

1013
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,339
Son, you talk
a lot of shit.
Yes, I do.

1014
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,342
But you down.

1015
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,844
What?
Are you kidding?

1016
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:33,013
You're going to let the white boy
join just like that?

1017
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:35,224
I was in secret agent school
for three years!

1018
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,518
Three years.
I paid for them classes myself.

1019
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,187
- You made me.
"Chief. Chief."

1020
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:42,064
I performed a full range
spectral analysis

1021
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:43,941
on Miss White She-Devil's
brain waves.

1022
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:46,360
Then, I unlocked
her subconscious

1023
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,695
using a special form
of hypnosis.

1024
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:50,572
Then, I gently brushed
her hair.

1025
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:53,575
Then, I reached
deep within

1026
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:56,662
her tight little pockets
and I found a list

1027
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:58,372
of The Man's targets.

1028
00:58:58,413 --> 00:58:59,456
Good Lord.

1029
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:00,916
They're going after
James Brown

1030
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,793
tomorrow night
at the Grammys.

1031
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:05,587
We need to stop him.
Find the General and give him the antidote.

1032
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,090
That's right.
It's goin' to the streets. Hey, y'all!

1033
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:10,092
It's revolution
up in this bitch!

1034
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,427
Set the alarm
to def-con five!

1035
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,388
It's on, baby. It's on.

1036
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,598
- "Good work, White She-Devil."
- Thanks.

1037
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:20,269
Oh, you in too.
What the fuck?! Chief!

1038
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,646
I never see that bitch
in my secret agent classes!

1039
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:24,606
I'm still paying
the loans off, man!

1040
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,108
I sleep
on a pissy mattress.

1041
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,776
I ain't got
good food to eat!

1042
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:29,945
I borrow money
for my weed!

1043
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:32,781
I quit.
That's it.

1044
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:35,784
Y'all don't got
Conspiracy Brother Jones
to kick around anymore!

1045
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:38,120
Give me a pillow case!
I'm joining the Klan.

1046
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,623
Brother, we all love
your solo enthusiasm,

1047
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,792
but this is about
working together.

1048
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,003
Now, I've been a solo star
shooting the shots

1049
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:48,130
that I thought
would win the game.

1050
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,882
But in workin' with y'all,

1051
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:51,925
I've come to realize

1052
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:54,428
that only a team wins
a championship.

1053
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:57,931
Teamwork! That's right.

1054
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,267
That's right.
I'm sorry, everybody.

1055
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:02,102
Teamwork!
Now, let's go!

1056
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,979
Hustle, hustle!
Come on, white girl!

1057
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:16,617
Best of luck tonight.

1058
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,285
Have a great time.

1059
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:20,787
We know The Man plans
to make his move tonight.

1060
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,456
Now, Lance,
we're counting on you.

1061
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:24,625
Don't get distracted,
be focused.

1062
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,336
Stick close to the target
at all times.

1063
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:29,171
Roger. Will do.

1064
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:36,845
Boo.
Ah.

1065
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:44,645
Ladies and gentlemen, James Brown.

1066
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,194
- How you doing?
- "James Brown."

1067
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,530
- "I want to see my fans."
- No, it's okay.

1068
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:56,240
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

1069
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,116
Perimeter search.
I'm on it.

1070
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:01,245
What is that boy doing?

1071
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:05,874
- "What's going on here?"
- Hey, Jimmy.

1072
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,918
What?

1073
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,212
Now, "I" feel good.

1074
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,214
- God, man!

1075
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:13,966
Lance. Lance!

1076
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,970
The hardest working man
in show business.

1077
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:21,807
Go get him.

1078
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,520
Thank you, James Brown.

1079
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:28,772
No! Hey!
I just got promoted!

1080
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:40,742
Hello, Mr. James Brown.

1081
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:43,912
Hello-ooo, Mr. James Brown.

1082
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,792
Ah!

1083
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,335
Good God!

1084
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:54,464
You will soon be administered
a drug that will make you...

1085
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:00,429
The signal's stopped.

1086
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,182
It's James Brown touchdown!

1087
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:05,225
- That's James Brown?
- That's mustard.

1088
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:08,604
I can't believe
I let him get away.
I am so stupid.

1089
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:10,606
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

1090
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:12,733
You got to stop
beating yourself up.

1091
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:15,110
We got to work together
as a team, okay?

1092
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:17,029
Yeah, man.
Let the team do it.

1093
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:21,116
I'm playin' with him.

1094
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,243
Stop playin'.
Hey!

1095
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,454
Damn.

1096
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:27,289
Hey, dawg. Hey.

1097
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,790
You need to lighten up.

1098
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,043
You know what I'm sayin'?

1099
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,378
Just be careful with this.
If you smoke too much,

1100
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,631
it's going to have you
all paranoid and shit.

1101
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:37,925
It takes time to build up
a tolerance like mine--

1102
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,718
What? Did you hear that?
Shh. Shh.

1103
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,803
Hey, y'all,
did you hear something?

1104
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:44,264
Shh, quiet!
There it goes again.

1105
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,440
Incoming vehicle!

1106
01:02:53,482 --> 01:02:56,151
- Don't you move!
- Hold it!

1107
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:58,028
Don't you move!

1108
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:02,616
- Identify yourself!
- I'm with lsland Fortress
Cleaning Service, sir.

1109
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:04,701
Oh, okay.
Thank you.

1110
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,246
- You so sweet.
- "Just the janitors."

1111
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:08,789
Let 'em through!

1112
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,811
Lance. Lance!

1113
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:34,773
So, Mr. Godfather of Soul--

1114
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,821
--Iife as you've known it
will soon cease to exist.

1115
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:44,700
Sorry.

1116
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:47,494
Any final requests?

1117
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,582
Say it loud.

1118
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
Say it loud!

1119
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,213
What's he doing?

1120
01:03:59,548 --> 01:04:01,008
Say it loud!

1121
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,433
- Say it loud!

1122
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,024
Say it loud!

1123
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:20,944
- Say it loud!
- I'm black and I'm proud!

1124
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:27,201
Hey, man, I want to get up
and do my thing now.

1125
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,413
 So good 

1126
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:32,915
 So good 

1127
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:35,459
 I got you... 

1128
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:37,794
- Oh.

1129
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,880
Hey!

1130
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:42,591
I feel good.

1131
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:46,553
- It's time for the big payback.

1132
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:51,350
Very clever,
Mr. Undercover Brother.

1133
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:54,478
- Whoa.
"Can you dig it?"

1134
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:58,607
Everything we'll need
to take it to The Man.

1135
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:01,026
Hey, this isn't Taco Bell.

1136
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,570
Can you find out
where the General is?

1137
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:05,405
Just give me 10 minutes.

1138
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:07,574
"Oh, shit!"

1139
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:08,992
You've got one.

1140
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:11,578
Intruders.

1141
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,248
The Brotherhood has breached
the communications room!

1142
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:17,042
Everything's a party over here
with you people, isn't it?

1143
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:20,128
That's not all.
The Man is on his way here.

1144
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,964
What? Now?

1145
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,967
His helicopter will be here
in five minutes.

1146
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:28,428
Mr. Elias,
would you kindly take care

1147
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:31,098
of the nuisance
in the communication room?

1148
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,267
Yes, sir.
Come on, let's go!

1149
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,018
Yes, sir.
Right away.

1150
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,604
- What have you done
with the General?
- General?

1151
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:39,481
Could you come
in here, please?

1152
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:44,736
General, if it's not
too much of a bother,

1153
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:46,905
would you mind terribly,
killing this man?

1154
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,325
Thank you.

1155
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,624
So I can always have something
to remember you by.

1156
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,418
Come on, hurry up.

1157
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,379
I wouldn't move
if I were you.

1158
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:04,715
Damn!
Oh, shit.

1159
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:06,341
Get off of me.
Sorry.

1160
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:08,635
Excellent work,
White She-Devil.

1161
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:10,929
Come here, baby.

1162
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,851
Damn, that girl
gets around.

1163
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:24,484
How can you do this to me?

1164
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:26,570
Once you've
had Undercover Brother,

1165
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:28,447
there is no other.

1166
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:33,118
No, it's once you go black,
you don't go back.

1167
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,039
It's the honky patrol.

1168
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,541
Let me do this.

1169
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,043
Ah, look who got
the gun now.

1170
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:42,711
- Yeah. What's up?!
- Hi.

1171
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:43,837
- Shut up!
- What?

1172
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,215
I said shut up, whitey!
I got the power.

1173
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:50,928
Keep working.

1174
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:52,971
This is a girl thing.

1175
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:04,441
- Breakdance.
- Break, what?

1176
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:07,361
I said, breakdance.
Come on.

1177
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:08,946
Take it!

1178
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:11,448
That's right.
That's good.

1179
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,242
Come on.
Kid 'n Play.

1180
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:14,993
- Kid and who?
- Come on.

1181
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:19,498
That's right.
Getting funky.

1182
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:24,127
Oh, yeah.

1183
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:26,046
I like black people.

1184
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:31,718
Oh, fight.

1185
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,096
Watch yourself.
Show 'em what you're working with.

1186
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,348
Oh!

1187
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:40,143
White She-Devil,
represent!

1188
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,105
Oh!

1189
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,651
Yeah.
- I got him.

1190
01:07:47,693 --> 01:07:49,820
I got him!
Vector four, section seven.

1191
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:54,032
Come on, General,
you got to give me that gun.

1192
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:57,619
Nonsense!
General, kill him!

1193
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,800
Undercover Brother,
are you okay?

1194
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:13,802
Everything's cool
now that you're here.

1195
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:18,140
Y'all gonna make me lose
my mind up in here!

1196
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:22,644
See what I've been
dealing with?

1197
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:24,146
Yeah.

1198
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:26,815
Situation complete.
We'll see you soon, Chief.

1199
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,362
Atomic core, eh?

1200
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:36,658
Let's see what this so-called
button does.

1201
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:39,578
Attention,

1202
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,955
atomic core set to overload.

1203
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:44,541
My bad.

1204
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,502
Here, General,
take the antidote.

1205
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,838
- Oh, what happened to me?

1206
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,677
Damn!

1207
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,388
You guys get
the General out of here.
I'm going after The Man.

1208
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,433
Let's get while
the getting's good.

1209
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:02,976
There'll be another day
to fight The Man.

1210
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:05,020
We can't give The Man
another damn day!

1211
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:08,273
But Sistah Girl's right.
We got to get the hell out of here, man.

1212
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:10,192
We're gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

1213
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,736
- Dig it! Dig it hard!
- Daddy!

1214
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:15,364
There's times for falling apart,
and there's times for getting funky.

1215
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:17,616
This is one
of those funky times!

1216
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:19,910
So, what's it going to be?!

1217
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:22,704
Are you ready to play
some funky music, white boy?

1218
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:31,296
Solid.

1219
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:33,006
Lay down the boogie.

1220
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,969
It's time to take it
to The Man.

1221
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,888
I guess this means you
and I are like brothers now, huh?

1222
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,807
I feel black.

1223
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:44,142
Man, you look white!

1224
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:46,562
Ow.
Don't touch me!

1225
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,063
Come on, General.
Let's go.

1226
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:49,815
Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

1227
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:51,775
- Come on!
- Go. Come on, nigga.

1228
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:56,572
Atomic core overload in five minutes.

1229
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,907
Please exit
in an orderly fashion.

1230
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,492
Stop him!

1231
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:20,179
Earth, wind and fire!

1232
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:22,973
Shaquille O'Neal!

1233
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:26,852
- Sisqo!
- No-ooo!

1234
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:38,447
I just bought those.

1235
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,032
Sorry about that.

1236
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,796
It's all over, man!

1237
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:00,594
You want some drama?

1238
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,471
Then bring it.

1239
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:06,767
Lance, protect the General
at all costs.

1240
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:10,354
Atomic core overload
in three minutes.

1241
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:14,816
Let me talk to them.
I'm white.

1242
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:20,030
We don't want
any trouble.

1243
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:21,823
What are you going
to do about it?

1244
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,825
Sissy.

1245
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:27,663
I am not

1246
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,706
a sissy!

1247
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,265
Come on!

1248
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,528
Oh.
Ugh!

1249
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:01,363
Lance.

1250
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:05,075
He shouldn't
have called me a sissy.

1251
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:09,621
Not bad, whitey.

1252
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:12,666
But if it was me, I would have ripped
his spine out of his ass!

1253
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:16,128
Let's go! We got less than a minute
before this place blows!

1254
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:41,945
 "They told him don't you ever"
"come around here" 

1255
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:44,573
 "Don't wanna see your face,"
"you better disappear" 

1256
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:48,035
 "The fire's in their eyes"
"and their words are really clear" 

1257
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:51,246
 "So beat it, just beat it" 

1258
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:55,125
 "You better run,"
"you better do what you can" 

1259
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:59,087
 "Don't wanna see no blood,"
"don't be a macho man" 

1260
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:02,049
 "You wanna be tough,"
"better do what you can" 

1261
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,427
 "So beat it,"
"but you wanna be bad" 

1262
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:08,222
 "Just beat it, beat it" 

1263
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:09,598
 "Beat it, beat it" 

1264
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:12,851
 "No one wants to be defeated" 

1265
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:16,438
 "Showin' how funky"
"and strong is your fight" 

1266
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,566
 "It doesn't matter"
"who's wrong or right" 

1267
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:20,943
 "Just beat it" 

1268
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:22,945
 "Just beat it" 

1269
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,780
 "Just beat it" 

1270
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,782
 "Just beat it" 

1271
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:33,455
 "You have to show them"
"that you're really not scared" 

1272
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:35,082
 "You're playin' with your life," 

1273
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:36,875
 "This ain't no truth or dare" 

1274
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,794
 "They'll kick you,"
"then they beat you" 

1275
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,379
 "Then they'll tell you it's fair" 

1276
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,924
 "So beat it,"
"but you wanna be bad" 

1277
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,968
 "Just beat it" 

1278
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,469
 "Beat it..." 

1279
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:50,097
- General, sir,
are you all right?
- Yes.

1280
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:52,975
There he is!
Undercover Brother!

1281
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:54,935
He's only got
a few seconds!

1282
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:10,784
- Oops.

1283
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,885
You mess with the 'fro,
you got to go.

1284
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,896
I believe
this belongs to me.

1285
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,748
So long,
Undercover Brother.

1286
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,917
He's failed me.

1287
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:44,086
Leave him.

1288
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:47,130
Hey! Don't be dissing me!

1289
01:15:56,723 --> 01:16:00,102
Hey! Let me in!

1290
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:06,567
Let me up!

1291
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:21,415
That Feather
went out like a sucka.

1292
01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:23,417
Punk ass bitch
played himself.

1293
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,711
Let's bounce, dawg.

1294
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:54,823
No! He doesn't have
his parachute!

1295
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:17,638
- Yeah.

1296
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,389
Come on over here. Hug me.

1297
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:24,186
 "What you knowin'" 

1298
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:26,522
 "To be real" 

1299
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:31,818
 "What you thinkin'" 

1300
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,987
 "I think I love you, baby..." 

1301
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:36,406
Undercover Brother,
you the baddest.

1302
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,951
Didn't I blow
your mind this time?

1303
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:40,369
Didn't I?

1304
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:43,038
Didn't you cause about
a bazillion dollars worth
of damage?

1305
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,957
And I sure as hell ain't
covering for you!

1306
01:17:44,998 --> 01:17:46,667
I don't give a damn
how sexy you look

1307
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,085
floating down
in your little pants!

1308
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:50,379
And as for the rest
of you...

1309
01:17:53,632 --> 01:17:55,759
I just want to say

1310
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:58,762
how very proud I am
of all of you.

1311
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:03,600
Undercover Brother,
the world is safe once again

1312
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:05,018
thanks to you.

1313
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,562
No thanks to me, Chief.

1314
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:09,398
I couldn't have done it
without Sistah Girl.

1315
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,233
You know what they say,

1316
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,360
"Behind every great
black man--"

1317
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:16,029
Is the police.

1318
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,073
-"Uh, no, no."
- A bunch of slow white athletes?

1319
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,199
- "No."
- A cute butt?

1320
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:21,743
- Probable cause?
- "No!"

1321
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:24,371
A strong black woman.

1322
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:26,248
- "Strong black woman."
- That's right.

1323
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:27,708
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

1324
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:29,710
It would've been cool
to have a Latino,

1325
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:31,336
a Native American,
Asian,

1326
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,797
even a Jewish guy
in the mix.

1327
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:36,133
The point is,
by working together as one,

1328
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:37,801
we got the job done.

1329
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:41,513
No doubt, that's what
the Brotherhood is all about.

1330
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,016
Solid.

1331
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,019
Oh!

1332
01:18:47,186 --> 01:18:49,813
Look out, y'all,
fallin' rocks!

1333
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,898
Shotgun!

1334
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:53,358
Having stopped Operation Whitewash,

1335
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:57,613
the Brotherhood distributed
an antidote to the mind control drug

1336
01:18:57,654 --> 01:18:59,239
to black people nationwide.

1337
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:01,116
And though The Man escaped,

1338
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,327
the Brotherhood had found their hero.

1339
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:05,287
Thanks to Undercover Brother,

1340
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:08,498
the world was once again
a funky place.

1341
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,960
 "We want the funk,"
"give up the funk" 

1342
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:14,588
-  "Everybody say" 
-  "We need the funk" 

1343
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,549
 "We got to have that funk" 

1344
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:19,885
 "A is for apples and J is for jack" 

1345
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,803
 "P is for punk"
"that's right as smack" 

1346
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:24,681
 "On track with this phat rap"
that I put down for you

1347
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,142
 "AII around the world"
"is the big dog pound for you" 

1348
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,353
 "In bump we thrust and trust" 

1349
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:31,230
 "Man, you can't funk with us" 

1350
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:33,440
 "Cold as a motha',"
"all the women love him" 

1351
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:36,109
 "'Cause they just want a piece"
"of the Undercover Brother" 

1352
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:38,487
 "They'll take him home tonight"
"'cause he's so dynamite" 

1353
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:40,989
 "Sort of like dolomite,"
"is that right? Show you right" 

1354
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:42,991
 "I got a little something"
"for groupies" 

1355
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:45,494
 "Snoopy Doopy"
"and Uncle Boosty" 

1356
01:19:45,536 --> 01:19:47,329
 "Turn me loose" 

1357
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:49,831
 "I'm just funkin'"
"with my nephew Snoop" 

1358
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:52,251
 "Where did you get"
"your funk, bro'?" 

1359
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,752
 "Let's get ready to shoop" 

1360
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:56,588
-  "I got to do it" 
-  "Undercover Brother" 

1361
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,091
 "The one you will discover" 

1362
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:01,593
 "You can't worry"
"what people tell you" 

1363
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:03,846
 "Yeah, baby" 

1364
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:05,430
 "We want the funk" 

1365
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,850
 "Get up off the funk." 

1366
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,330
 "Work and work" 

1367
01:20:30,372 --> 01:20:32,958
 "Well, those cars"
"never seem to stop comin'" 

1368
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,501
 "Work and work" 

1369
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:37,129
 "Keep those rags"
"and machines hummin'" 

1370
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:39,173
 "Get them washed"
"right away" 

1371
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:43,343
-  "At the car wash" 
-  "Talkin' about the car wash" 

1372
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:45,137
 "Car wash, yeah" 

1373
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,389
 "Sing it with feelin', y'all" 

1374
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:49,474
 "Cash wash, yeah" 

1375
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,602
 "Ooh-oh-oh" 

1376
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,437
 "At the car wash" 

1377
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:57,274
 "Car wash, yeah" 

1378
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:00,903
 "Car wash"

 "Car wash, yeah." 

1380
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:11,121
 "Whatever happened" 

1381
01:21:11,163 --> 01:21:12,664
 "To the brotherman?" 

1382
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:14,625
 "Livin' on the streets" 

1383
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,585
 "Sometimes I wonder" 

1384
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:20,005
 "What he's doing,"
"'cause it could have been me" 

1385
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:25,928
 "Praises to the make-up"
"off the times we used to know" 

1386
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:28,096
 "And thinkin' 'bout"
"the good days" 

1387
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,933
 "Set his mind to let them go" 

1388
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,060
 "Trouble runnin' 'round" 

1389
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:36,438
 "And life ain't what it used to be" 

1390
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,358
 "Now God"
"has blessed America" 

1391
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,401
 "And some to you and me" 

1392
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:44,655
 "Whatever happened"
"to the brotherman?" 

1393
01:21:44,696 --> 01:21:46,657
 "Livin' on the streets" 

1394

 "Sometimes I wonder"
"what he's doin'" 

1395
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:52,120
 "'Cause it could"
"have been me" 

1396
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:57,543
 "Whatever happened"
"to the wonderful fantasy?" 

1397
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:00,796
 "When mother used to watch us"
"with a smilin' face" 

1398
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:03,131
 "Smilin' face" 

1399
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,011
 "Oh, we're standing" 

1400
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:10,305
 "In the wrong direction" 

1401
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:14,184
 "And we need"
"a little affection, yeah" 

1402
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:18,397
 "And if you dig this song" 

1403
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:20,023
 "Better let me know" 

1404
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,818
-  "Please let me know" 
-  "Don't let me go" 

1405
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,653
 "Don't let me go"

 "Sometimes I wonder"
"what he's doin'" 

1409
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:34,913
 "'Cause it could"
"have been me" 

1410
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:40,169
 "Whatever happened"

1411
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:42,296
 "When mother used to watch us"

1412
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:46,091

01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:49,052
 "We complaining 'cause we livin'"
"in the greatest nation" 

1414

 "We should be thankful,"
"Iivin' large" 

1415
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:52,431
 "Bringing celebration" 

1416
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:56,351
 "America, now where's"
"your appreciation?" 

1417
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:59,396
 "Whatever happened"
"to the brotherman?" 

1418
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:01,315
 "Livin' on the streets" 

1419
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:04,693
 "Sometimes I wonder"

1420
01:23:04,735 --> 01:23:07,529
 "'Cause it could"

1421
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:12,117
 "Whatever happened"
"to the wonderful fantasy?" 

1422
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:15,204
 "When mother used to watch us"
"with a smilin' face..." 

1423
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:24,087
 "AII... night... Iong" 

1424
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:34,264
 "AII... night... Iong." 

1425
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:38,769
Damn, who is that?

1426
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:41,230
Hold that thought
and that feelin', baby.

1427
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:43,524
Just let it percolate.
I'll be right back.

1428
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:46,276
- "Hurry up, baby."

1429
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,242
Hi.

1430
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:56,703
Uh, White She-Devil,
what you doing here?

1431
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,122
Remember? You told me
to come over.

1432
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,667
And me and you
and Sistah Girl

1433
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,126
could make Oreos.

1434
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,169
Shh.

1435
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:05,629
Sweet and black
on both sides

1436
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:09,091
with a dreamy white filling
in the middle.

1437
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,426
Then I realized--
you can't make Oreos.

1438
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:13,554
So, I bought some.

1439
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:19,059
Some people got jungle fever.
She got the flu.

1440
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,728
- You know.
- U.B.!

1441
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:27,276
 "AII... night... Iong" 

1442
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:31,655
 "I can't wait"
"to love you, baby" 

1443
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:37,244
 "AII... night... Iong." 

1444
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:41,957
 "Rapp Payback" 

1445
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,793
 "Oh..." 

1446
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:50,340
 "Hit me" 

1447
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:55,554
 "Rapp payback" 

1448
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:57,681
 "Little Jerry" 

1449
01:24:57,723 --> 01:25:01,226
 "I know you've heard"
"the master jiggy out" 

1450
01:25:02,311 --> 01:25:05,272
 "I know you've heard"
"the master jiggy out" 

1451
01:25:06,732 --> 01:25:08,817
 "Dance, oh yes" 

1452
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:11,486
 "Although you got it" 

1453
01:25:11,528 --> 01:25:13,071
 "Out there..." 

1454
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:23,290
 "Payback, I'm mad" 

1455
01:25:24,374 --> 01:25:26,835
 "Lay down" 

1456
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:28,962
 "I'm mad" 

1457
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:31,340
-  "Payback, ain't it?" 
-  "Payback" 

1458
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:33,342
 "Man, good God,"
"wait a minute" 

1459
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:37,804
 "Hey, I..." 

1460
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:43,852
 "Saved ya" 

1461
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:47,689
 "Take me back" 

1462
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:49,525
 "We going back" 

1463
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:51,860
 "Payback" 

1464
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:53,237
 "Payback." 

1465
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:58,450
Solid.
