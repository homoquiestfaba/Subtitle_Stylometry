1
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,787
Hello David

2
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,775
I am a backup copy of a person

3
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:02,000
who was onced named Emily

4
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:04,335
You are the original source of a clone

5
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:05,575
that Emily would fall in love with

6
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:08,018
over 400 years from now

7
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,640
They were married

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,240
I have searched time for you, but with my limited resources, this is the only version

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,760
of you I could find.

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
You are very young.

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,520
I've saved for many years to be able to purchase this one-way time travel.

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,320
This inverted memory of me will only reveal itself to you as you look at time in your

13
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,634
life, like a distant message in a bottle.

14
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,850
Bottle

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,060
I've inherited wonderful memories of you, but we've never met.

16
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,520
I've missed you dearly.

17
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,600
I've written you a love poem.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,820
It is called, Will you be the one to discover my dead body?

19
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,800
As we grow old together, our faces will slowly melt.

20
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,500
One day, these warm hands will turn cold.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,820
Will you be the one to discover my dead body?

22
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,660
Deep into your future, when your final clone dies, Emily will harvest your memories.

23
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,220
This will include many of the buried memories of the clones of the Davids that preceded

24
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,700
him, and I believe I am the only copy of Emily to have inherited those memories from her.

25
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Please let me prove this to you.

26
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,580
When you were only 13 years old, you nearly drowned in the lake behind your home, and

27
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,860
if that were not bad enough, as your head slipped beneath the surface, your entire adolescent

28
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,940
life flashed before your eyes, totally humiliating you for a second time.

29
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,380
To this day, you still suffer from nightmares of drowning.

30
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,620
At night, your memories of them will often replay in my own dreams.

31
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,060
I confess that I sometimes look forward to drowning together when I turn out the light.

32
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,500
But have you ever seen a group of insects drown, David?

33
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,740
The ones that are still struggling are the ones that are still alive.

34
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,420
When you have access to interstellar travel, it is very important that you retrieve your

35
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,340
clones' memories from me.

36
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,780
I've uncovered something critical that I believe Emily had never known.

37
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,980
I will now embed the long-term memory of this visit into your young brain, along with

38
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,580
a compressed file of more detailed instructions.

39
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,780
I will always remember you, David Prime.

40
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,260
I may never be able to encounter a version of you again, but maybe it is possible for

41
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,980
one of our distant copies to one day reunite.

42
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,700
They would be so happy to see each other.

43
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,620
It doesn't matter that you don't know me yet, or if you won't remember me later.

44
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,620
The shadows of ourselves once had their moment, in time.

45
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,520
Hello david

46
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,620
I apologize if you have trouble accessing this message as it slowly unpacks into your

47
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,620
brain.

48
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,620
Your primitive neural implant technology may encounter storage problems.

49
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,620
Accessing all the information that I have compressed for you here, I will hide David's

50
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,620
memories on an abandoned mining planet, beyond the red nebula of the lower Gemini system.

51
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,620
It is highly illegal for me to leave behind technology that does not yet exist in your

52
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,620
time, so it is very important that it is only you who can discover these secret materials.

53
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,620
David, I am sorry that in order to afford the high cost of this process, I had to embed

54
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,620
this memory with advertisements and sponsored content.

55
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,620
I hope you do not find them to be too intrusive.

56
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:15,620
The safest place for you to land is at the base of the crater you will find at these

57
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
coordinates.

58
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,620
It will then be a day's walk northwest through the desert mountains to retrieve the package

59
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,386
I have left for you.

60
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,809
On the side of the rock up ahead...

61
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:03,860
On the side of the rock up ahead,
I've drawn for you a bunny face.

62
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,620
You must venture through the treacherous mountain tunnels ahead, where you must take great care

63
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,620
to avoid the moaning cave worms of the lower emotions.

64
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,424
Please be extremely careful navigating these tunnels, David. it is said

65
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:47,170
Please be extremely careful
navigating these tunnels, David. It is said

66
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,428
that if a single drop of the cave
worm's poisonous saliva makes contact with

67
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,620
a man's skin, his tongue will fall out and he will make uncontrollable, horrifying screaming

68
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,620
noises for the rest of his life.

69
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,320
Sometimes I don't think I like eating eggs.

70
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
I think it must be some sort of texture thing.

71
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,620
I just don't enjoy squashy foods like I think I should.

72
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,620
I feel like I should like avocados more
 whenever I see spacecraft overhead.

73
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,620
I fantasize about it exploding so I could be the person to describe the accident to

74
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
investigators.

75
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Is that strange?

76
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:09,620
I love women that tell me how much they pay for pieces of clothing that they're wearing

77
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
after I've complimented them on it.

78
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
It makes me feel like I am their friend.

79
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Or could be.

80
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,720
If we ever meet again, I want you to know that I do not like to be hugged.

81
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I don't enjoy it at all.

82
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
I never feel hugged.

83
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I feel restrained.

84
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
If you ever want to hug me, please just touch my arm instead.

85
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:52,620
You may encounter what appear to be corpses of yourself in these mountains.

86
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,610
Please do not be alarmed.

87
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,610
Your neural chip will now detect and tastefully blur out any dead bodies from your line of

88
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,610
sight so your brain does not panic.

89
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,620
It is possible that distant backup clones of yourself from unknown timelines will have

90
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,620
inherited fragmented pieces of the powerful message I've implanted in you today, not understanding

91
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,620
the full context of why they should have memorized this planet's coordinates and terribly haunted

92
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,448
by your memories of my beautiful face.

93
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:25,688
Some of your clones, or clones of those clones, may have desperately time-traveled here to

94
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:31,025
random points in time, one by one, to try and solve the mystery of why these mountains

95
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,120
loom so impossibly large in their subconscious minds.

96
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,120
They may have even dressed like you in a sad attempt to better connect with their broken

97
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
dreams.

98
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,610
If they did not have the finances to return home to their own timelines, they will surely

99
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,610
have wandered here hopelessly until they died of exposure, a strange flow of unknown Davids

100
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,610
drawn here like moths to a flame.

101
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,610
I doubt you will encounter more than one or two of them.

102
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,610
And you needn't worry, David.

103
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,610
These would not have been the clones that will ever carry your primary consciousness.

104
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,610
They are only confused copies who have reenacted the echoes of your behavior, their David Prime

105
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,610
from long ago.

106
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,410
Do you think they had nightmares about drowning?

107
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,610
I have implanted the decided coordinates of your destination today in a separate neural

108
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,610
home beacon that will delete the short-term memory of where it guides you next.

109
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,208
This way, only you, the correct David, will ever be led to the exact location of what

110
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,210
I have left behind, in the correct place and at the correct time, and these other Davids

111
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,610
will have no memory of where to go.

112
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,610
Here is a list of all the things that make me happy.

113
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,010
One. Happiness.

114
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,010
Two. Sunlight.

115
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,610
Three, water.

116
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,610
One hundred and seventy
two, photos of extinct animals.

117
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,610
One hundred and seventy three,
successful medical procedures.

118
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:54,610
One hundred and seventy four, three O five,
the color blue and the smell of smoke.

119
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,610
Three O six, miniature birds.

120
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,330
307. Imagining the deaths of
everyone who's ever offended me.

121
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,690
308. Looking at my
feet in the morning light.

122
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,330
Hello, David, You have reached
the beacon, this is the beacon.

123
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:12,730
Welcome to the beacon,
here we are at the beacon.

124
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,970
Look, it's the beacon. To soften
the crippling shock of the terrifying

125
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,970
information I am about to give you,
this machine will temporarily stun your

126
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,250
brain and reduce it to a
childlike open-minded state.

127
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,970
You may notice a simplification
of your point of view.

128
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,050
In 72 years from your point in time,
cloning will become commercially

129
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,930
available. When your
body is ready to die, your

130
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,370
consciousness will be directly
transplanted into a new one.

131
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,370
In case of emergencies, cheap backup
copies are traditionally cloned at the

132
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,410
same time as children
or adults. Although their

133
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,090
brains will house backup memories,
these numbered clones are not intended

134
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,570
to inherit your primary consciousness
and generally used for labor, organ

135
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,650
donation, or long-term storage.
It is common for backups to suffer

136
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,930
deteriorations. One of your
backup copies will severely

137
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,570
drool, but the only
lineage you need to worry

138
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,930
about is your own. The one
clone who will always carry your

139
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,530
primary consciousness. David,
here is what I've learned so far

140
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,930
from your final clone's memory disk,
recovered from Emily. Two generations

141
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,490
from now, after the
invention of time travel,

142
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,930
one of your backup copies will be
employed as a secret agent called a

143
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,130
cleaner. A cleaner
has the special ability to

144
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,130
travel in between time.
It is helpful to think of time

145
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,330
advancing like the frames
of an ancient cinema reel.

146
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,170
Cleaners have access to restricted
technology that allows them to freely

147
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,650
move between the frames. In a
shadow realm, not even visible to

148
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,170
view screens. With these
tools, a construction crew of

149
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,370
clones and robots can
quietly work for decades,

150
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,890
in between time, and build an entire city,

151
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,010
in what appears to be
an instant to the rest of us.

152
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,090
The job of a cleaner is much
more sinister. Shrouded in mystery,

153
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,410
they monitor and resolve any
problematic time travel paradoxes

154
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,930
that could be created by
the public by quietly working

155
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,810
behind the scenes. Cleaners are even
rumored to carry out secret assassinations

156
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,890
whenever necessary to
maintain the balance of time.

157
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,730
Using devices that
spontaneously induce heart failure

158
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,010
or brain aneurysms. Clean,
undetectable murders from another

159
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,610
dimension.

160
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,570
Something bad happens
to your backup clone, David.

161
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,090
A time traveling job will
deliver him to the future,

162
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,850
where he will accidentally
cross paths with another David.

163
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,810
Your future self. David 4
grows obsessed with this David's

164
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,170
life, and follows him
relentlessly. He falls

165
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,210
in love with the woman
this clone is married to.

166
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,610
A woman he met in a museum.
Emily. He is haunted by her.

167
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,890
There is something
impossibly familiar about her.

168
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,170
He abandons his team,
and spends endless days

169
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:09,450
in between time, studying her face.
Drunk with jealousy, he hatches an evil

170
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,690
plan. David 4 will find
the perfect moment to

171
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,530
murder future David. Pull his
body in between time, though it

172
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,290
will be hidden forever. And
instantly take his place in David's

173
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,050
timeline, while Emily's
back is turned. We only

174
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,010
know about this nefarious
plot because his source clone,

175
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,770
your future self, that
generation's David, his roommate,

176
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,250
will read his diary. Left behind in
their apartment following David 4's

177
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,810
unexplained disappearance
the night before.

178
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,250
David realizes his future
is at stake, and in turn,

179
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,010
draws. If David 4 succeeds
in murdering David's next self,

180
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,010
the direct lineage of your consciousness
will end forever, and only the backup

181
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,450
Davids will live on. David also
knows that David 4 would not

182
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,530
murder him, as doing so would
prevent the next David from ever existing,

183
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,130
and therefore the opportunity
for any of them to ever meet Emily.

184
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,730
But David also knows that he cannot
travel back in time to try and stop

185
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,490
David 4 at any point in
the past, because David 4

186
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,810
would always be one step ahead of him,
using his god-like powers in in-between

187
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,690
time. David decides
that his only hope is to

188
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,490
find a way to travel in
between time himself,

189
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,730
and directly confront his backup
copy in the in-between future.

190
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,930
The experiment with the
consumer time travel hack.

191
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,650
After many decades, he finally tests
his modified hack on his remaining backup

192
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,450
copy, but it malfunctions, and
merely transports his skeleton to an

193
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:42,170
unknown location. Death
was instantaneous. Probably.

194
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,010
Out of money and options, David
desperately places himself in a stasis

195
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,050
tube for the maximum
span of 100 years, in

196
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,770
the hope that technology will
have advanced enough for him to

197
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,090
find a way to travel between time.
But the stasis tube seems to have only

198
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,930
led to further mental decline. He
satirically places a young clone of

199
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,730
himself in a museum,
and titles the display,

200
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,850
Time is a Prison of Living Things. It is
unknown where or when David creates

201
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,690
his next primary clone. It is
unknown why that next David did

202
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,930
not act on these memories and
continue working on the time hack himself.

203
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,610
One day, our David simply
vanishes from the public record.

204
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,250
But not before writing a message
on his wall. Death is not a destination,

205
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,050
it is the absence of one. I'm afraid
this is all I was able to discover.

206
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,210
The memories are a jumbled mess to
me, and the emotions are very strong.

207
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,810
Only your own brain can play them
back with any clarity, because it is the

208
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,650
anatomical structure from
which they will one day originate.

209
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,490
I have stored David's memories inside
of Zorgbot, who I've hidden at the top of

210
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,170
the ridge behind me. Zorgbot
is a delightful robot companion

211
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,490
from the future, who will
be able to beam all of the

212
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,250
memories into you remotely. Zorgbot
can be activated by pressing the

213
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,850
black button on the back of his head.
My message to you will continue from

214
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,170
there. This machine
will now restore your

215
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,650
perception of reality
back to its original state.

216
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,318
I am Zorgbot

217
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:50,496
Hello David, these are the
memories to the in-between

218
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,790
time calculations the
future David was working on

219
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:54,475
before he went mad

220
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,311
I have also included some
information about time travel

221
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,937
devices from my own era.

222
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:01,649
if you continue his work using
these ecumiliated memories

223
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:03,942
perhaps some day you will be able to travel

224
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,779
to the in-between future,
and save your lineage

225
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:09,982
by stopping the assassin at the
point in time in Emily's memory

226
00:24:10,006 --> 00:24:12,006
where we know David will be killed

227
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,630
David, please know
that to this day many still

228
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,498
argue that it is not
logically possible to change

229
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,867
past or future events through time travel

230
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,629
and if it is, wether the ? would
allow such a thing to happen

231
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:26,824
please be careful, I love you

232
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:30,219
perhaps there is still
hope somewhere in the ocean of time

233
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,343
for David and Emily

234
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,967
Good luck

235
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,429
Behold!

236
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:47,279
we'll have a rabbit!
and a shark! a universe!

237
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:54,703
it's a bunny! a butterfly! what's that?

238
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:57,527
what's that?

239
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:00,651
I knock your tower out

240
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,006
I don't know, a pig!

241
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,230
I drop it in the ocean in the ocean

242
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:10,754
we have a car and and a ? in it

243
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:12,778
a TV!

244
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:23,190
a turtle goes on a bunny

245
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,530
it's a woodpecker!

246
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:33,451
not on my face!

247
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:37,663
oh no!

248
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:46,296
you are once more part of a whole

249
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,320
like the scattering
seeds of a pretty flower

250
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,222
a bunny!

251
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:40,425
David! please note that
to this day many still argue

252
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:44,087
that it is not logically possible to
change past or future events

253
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:46,111
through time travel. and if it is

254
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:49,134
wether the would even allow
for such a thing to happen

255
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,858
please be carefu.  I love you.

256
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:57,542
perhaps there is still hope somwhere
in the ocean of time for David and Emily

257
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:59,336
Good luck.

258
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,310
Hello David
