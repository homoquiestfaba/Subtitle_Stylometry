00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,360
Don't let anyone see.

3
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,918
Let's do this, motherfucker.

4
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:09,788
Come on.

5
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,881
Oh, my God.

6
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,385
This kid looks like he
suffers from Goblets.

7
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,519
You can't say that.

8
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,187
He was in a fire, you know.

9
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,857
- Was he?
- Yes. He was in a...

10
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,258
Well, the fire made him look really funny.

11
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:54,398
This kid looks actually
spot on like a bagel.

12
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,233
What are you talking about?

13
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,635
This kid looks like an ice sculpture.

14
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,004
She always reminded me of a backpack.

15
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:03,506
Always.

16
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,510
Jasmine Stamford. Would you?

17
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,143
I think so.

18
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,911
She would snap your dick off.

19
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:09,915
What about her?

20
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,481
Probably.

21
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,350
She's blonde though, I don't really...

22
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:14,750
You don't like blondes?

23
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,519
Since when have you not liked blondes?

24
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,087
I don't know.

25
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,822
I don't know what I want anymore.

26
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:20,957
Oh, wait a minute.

27
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,293
I think we all agree that
Ms. Barron is hot as shit.

28
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:25,594
Oh, Ms. Barron!

29
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,296
She is fucking ridiculous.

30
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,932
So fucking sexy.

31
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,067
She should not be allowed to be a teacher.

32
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,301
What about her?

33
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,937
Mm.

34
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,608
Allison Bannister.

35
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:39,009
Obviously. Obviously.

36
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,310
Anytime, anywhere.

37
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,411
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

38
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:44,880
Son, I'd do that shit for the
talent show, if that's what it took.

39
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:46,015
That is disgusting.

40
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:47,651
On stage, in front of everyone.

41
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,722
Fuck yes! What, you wouldn't?

42
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,589
- At the talent show?
- Yeah, whatever.

43
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:55,158
No. I mean...

44
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,860
Obviously... Okay.

45
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:57,827
Allison is very cute.

46
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,163
We know that, yeah? And she's very cool.

47
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,099
But, like, we know her.
You can't be saying this...

48
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,670
I don't know.

49
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,404
I like her.

50
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,406
Yeah, I like her too.

51
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,908
Yeah. Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

52
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,209
We actually know her.

53
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,678
I actually hang out with her sometimes.

54
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,312
It's just weird to be talking about her.

55
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:17,582
Hang out with her?

56
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,252
Yeah, like, in...

57
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:24,154
Like group stuff, you know, in school.

58
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,525
Like in history class or something.

59
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,328
You got any drinks?

60
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,898
Yeah, like, caffeine-free Coke.

61
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,433
Well, then...

62
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,269
Man, I hate the fucking winter.

63
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,339
It's such a goddamn schlep to do anything.

64
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,440
"Schlep"? What are you, a grandpa?

65
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,543
The cold, it's debilitating.

66
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,478
It's awful. It hurts my face.

67
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,046
I don't know. Christmas rules.

68
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,416
Anyway, it gets really
pretty when it snows.

69
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,517
- "It gets really pretty"?
- Yeah, it does.

70
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,319
All right, Mom. We're going out for a bit.

71
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,021
I'll make sure to be home for dinner.

72
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,188
I love you. Bye.

73
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,092
Bye.

74
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:02,894
Huh?

75
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:08,264
You know when you're
in your maximum velocity

76
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,199
and the gears just don't work anymore?

77
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,904
No, I have no maximum velocity.

78
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,977
My power is untethered and ever-growing.

79
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,351
Do aliens even have feelings?

80
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:30,986
Dude, I don't care if they have feelings.

81
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,522
The Silver Surfer is the
loneliest dude in the galaxy.

82
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:34,990
I don't... I mean...

83
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,827
The Punisher's pretty haunted, dude.

84
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,329
Look, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

85
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,897
Don't even start me in
with that Punisher shit.

86
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,500
Shit. Is that Daryl?

87
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:46,135
Leave him alone.

88
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:47,404
What's up, cock fighters?

89
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,807
What, you wanna go?

90
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,543
Huh?

91
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,945
- Hi.
- I'm Josh.

92
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,413
You don't go to our school, do you?

93
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,382
No. Callaway Middle. Yeah.

94
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,686
Go Cougars.

95
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,855
Oh, you're... You're
Carol's little brother?

96
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,957
- Yeah, I'm Charlie.
- Oh, right. Carol Barth.

97
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,224
I know who Carol is.

98
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,892
Everybody knows who Tig is.

99
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:10,926
Come on, man.

100
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:11,928
Tig Bitty Bart.

101
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,529
- You love it. You love it.
- Oh, my God. Stop.

102
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:15,067
You smell like a cat box.

103
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,937
These are fucking chopped onions.

104
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,039
What are you getting?

105
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:21,807
Nice.

106
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:27,610
Ew. Melon soda? Sounds gross.

107
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,346
They wouldn't make it if it was gross.

108
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,579
They make gross stuff all the time.

109
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:31,882
Pickles are gross.

110
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,753
- Pickles are not gross.
- I like pickles.

111
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:38,255
Hey, what do you... What
do you make of that thing?

112
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,759
Oh, that's been there forever.

113
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:44,163
Dried squid? Holy shit!

114
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,563
It's pretty gross.

115
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,964
Somebody eats it.

116
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,332
Nobody eats this shit.

117
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,236
Let's get it.

118
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,605
- Yes!
- Thank you.

119
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,072
Oh, shit!

120
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,373
Squid.

121
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,507
Squid. Squid.

122
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,976
- I wanna see you eat it.
- Squid.

123
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,146
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

124
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,981
Squid. Come on.

125
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,483
Squid. Squid. Squid.
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

126
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:09,084
Oh, God.

127
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:11,990
Great.

128
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,259
Give me some of that shit.

129
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,827
- Try this.
- You guys are whacked.

130
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,130
Seriously? Oh, my God, that's...

131
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,531
Don't do it. Don't do... Oh!

132
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:22,865
Oh, my God!

133
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,836
It's horrible, isn't it?

134
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:27,637
It's not terrible.

135
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,372
It's not Skittles either, is it?

136
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,977
No, it's not Skittles.

137
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,612
Skittles is fucking delicious.

138
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,082
Fuck this fucking shit.

139
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,616
Oh, fuck!

140
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,621
It's nasty. Oh, my God!

141
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,757
Guys, lately I've been
thinking a lot about hands.

142
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,693
What the fuck you thinking about hands?

143
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,927
If I got one or both hands cut off,

144
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:54,797
what kind of prosthetic hands I would wear.

145
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,766
If I lost a hand, I'd
definitely get a hook.

146
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,535
Yeah, fucking hook.

147
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,603
Like from <i>Peter Pan?</i> Seriously?

148
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,737
But why stop there?

149
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,805
There's so many different types of hands.

150
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,175
You could have a hot hand

151
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,009
that just cooks steaks.

152
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,911
A fucking hot hand is not a fucking thing.

153
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:11,580
You could fucking have lighter hands.

154
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:13,718
Fucking set shit on fire.

155
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:16,752
Why is this bridge even closed?

156
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:17,887
Yeah, what the fuck?

157
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,289
You guys didn't hear? Somebody died.

158
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,323
No one died.

159
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,092
- Somebody died?
- Yes.

160
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,462
Don't fucking cry, Charlie.
Everybody fucking dies.

161
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,196
I'm not gonna die.

162
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,565
I'm fucking immortal. Like Highlander.

163
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,134
Hey, wait up, you motherfuckers.

164
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:36,805
Tomorrow marks the end of my
week-long fast from masturbating.

165
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:38,608
Why the fuck would you
ever do that to yourself?

166
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,977
Because if you wait like a week,

167
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,113
it feels really good
when you go back to it.

168
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,517
Guys, yesterday my parents fucking
rented that movie <i>True Lies.</i>

169
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,588
And after they went to sleep, I fucking
watched that scene where she stripped

170
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,989
over and over and over and over and over.

171
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:56,693
I must have jerked off
two and a half times.

172
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,294
- Is that a record?
- We don't wanna hear this.

173
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,229
I tried for three, but my dick got sore.

174
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,998
So I went to the freezer to get some ice,

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
but there was none in the tray.

176
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,100
So I got a fucking steak instead.

177
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:07,103
Ugh. You put it back in the freezer?

178
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,171
Fuck no. I cooked that shit up,

179
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,206
scarfed it and passed out on the couch.

180
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,776
Dude, that's fucking disgusting.

181
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,044
You fucking idiots.

182
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,646
Of course I fucking put it back.

183
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:17,881
You know, that doesn't make it better.

184
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,315
Someone's gonna eat that.

185
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,816
Oh, my God. This is not the
point of the fucking story.

186
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,017
What is the point of the story?

187
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,552
- I'm getting to it.
- He's getting to it.

188
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,223
The point it, bitch be hot.

189
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,590
Like Charlie's sister.

190
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,526
Shut the fuck up.

191
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,661
Or Zach's mom.

192
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,698
Yes. Sorry, Zach.

193
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,819
You think if you jump from
up here on a boat down there,

194
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,887
you could break through
the deck and sink it?

195
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,725
Like in a cartoon or something?

196
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:01,690
I doubt it.

197
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:04,160
My uncle did it one time
on the Fourth of July.

198
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,161
No, he didn't.

199
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,262
Yeah, he did.

200
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,796
He won a thousand bucks,
but broke his fucking leg,

201
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:08,864
'cause he slipped on a fish.

202
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:10,199
Guess that evens out then.

203
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:10,934
Fuck, yeah.

204
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,838
Slickest shit I ever saw.

205
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,804
I could do it.

206
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,439
Are you special forces?

207
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,674
No, but my uncle was.

208
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,475
So fuck you.

209
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,233
I guess I just, like, feel
bad for Daryl, you know.

210
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,536
We used to hang out a lot in third grade.

211
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,338
And it's not his fault
that his dad's fucking poor.

212
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,174
Still, it doesn't make him not a douchebag.

213
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,242
He's not a douchebag, Josh.

214
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,145
Look, he can be a little much sometimes,

215
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:32,047
but it's not like he
ever means anybody harm.

216
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,052
Still hang out with him like in school?

217
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:36,855
We have health together.

218
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,893
He's always trying to hit on Cindy Maples.

219
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,294
Cindy Maples is the one
that went to the hospital

220
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,595
because she had a frozen
hot dog in her vagina?

221
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:47,729
Yeah, yeah. That's her.

222
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:48,730
Cool.

223
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:50,166
Give me that bong, Amber.

224
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:50,967
Shit.

225
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,104
Josh, we have to go.

226
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,239
Hey, hey, hey.

227
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,007
- Hey. Hey!
- Josh, don't stop.

228
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,446
- Just keep going.
- What?

229
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,246
You seen my cunt?

230
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:04,012
Forget it.

231
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,148
- What?
- Have you seen my cunt?

232
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,650
Josh...

233
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,252
Dana, his girlfriend.

234
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,920
We haven't seen anybody's cunt.

235
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,754
We're actually kind of in a rush.

236
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:14,489
Josh, right?

237
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:16,559
- Yeah.
- How's Danny doing?

238
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,460
He get that basic training?

239
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:19,831
They break him in yet?

240
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,696
What?

241
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,699
Tell him I wanna hang out with
him when he's back in town.

242
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,571
I bet he's great at sucking dick now.

243
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,107
Josh's brother joined the Navy.

244
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,742
It's the Marines.

245
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:33,810
What?

246
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,210
It's the fucking Marines!

247
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,981
- What's that?
- Fuck you!

248
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:40,983
What did you say?

249
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:42,288
Careful, his pussy's out.

250
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,753
Fucking Marines.

251
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,689
Damn right it is.

252
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,757
You boys wanna join the fucking Marines?

253
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,129
I'm recruiting tonight.

254
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,829
Fuck those fucking fuckers!

255
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,265
Fuck John Whitcomb too.

256
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,066
What kind of asshole
puts Kool-Aid in his hair?

257
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,902
People like that are fucking worthless.

258
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,704
John is okay.

259
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,273
He used to be until he started
hanging out with these pieces of shit.

260
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,242
All right, Josh. We're over it.

261
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:07,776
- Doesn't matter now.
- Yeah, whatever.

262
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,215
Man, come on. Let's go this way.

263
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:11,814
Come on.

264
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,018
That's her house.

265
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,218
Who, Allison?

266
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,618
Uh-huh.

267
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,820
How do you know where she lives?

268
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:22,227
We would take the same bus
before they changed the route.

269
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:24,929
She's cool, right?

270
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,229
She is very cool.

271
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:28,998
You could leave her a note if you wanted.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,136
"Dear, Allison. I had this
idea for the talent show."

273
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,042
Ever told you of that
time with the glue bottle?

274
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,941
No.

275
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,642
It was like...

276
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,911
You know, it was like last year.

277
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm doing art and you know when like...

278
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,282
In the glue bottles, when
the glue dries over on the top

279
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,185
- and you can't open it?
- Uh-huh.

280
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,787
So she was trying to open this glue bottle,

281
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,824
she couldn't get it. I don't know, she
was just struggling for some reason.

282
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:57,493
And I just couldn't stop staring at her.

283
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:00,296
And then all of a sudden,
the whole thing just ruptured.

284
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:04,199
Just went... Shit, there's
white glue all over her hands.

285
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:07,538
And she just looked
and whispered, "Whoops."

286
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,644
It was the most erotic moment of my life.

287
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,581
You know, 'cause the glue is like sperm.

288
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,214
Oh.

289
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,782
So the bottle is sort of like the penis!

290
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,050
Dude, come on. What the fuck?

291
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,252
Nobody is here. Nobody is here, Josh.

292
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,787
- The car's not in the drive.
- There's other people.

293
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:26,989
There's nobody around here.

294
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:28,326
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

295
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,936
Oh.

296
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,643
- Hey.
- You got me.

297
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,111
- Oh, hey, Josh.
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

298
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,411
Are you staying for dinner?

299
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,280
No, ma'am. I'm just here
to pick up my things.

300
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,118
Great. 'Cause I didn't make enough.

301
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,818
My, um, parents have been

302
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,487
wanting me home earlier lately,

303
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,656
because my mom gets
depressed if I'm not there.

304
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,925
- Aw!
- He's full of shit.

305
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,495
- Now...
- It's all crap.

306
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,132
- All right.
- Bye.

307
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,435
- See you, man.
- Yeah.

308
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,037
What are you making?

309
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,674
Cubed steak.

310
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,307
What's that?

311
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,580
It's a steak in cubed form.

312
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,350
Oh, you, sir...

313
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,753
had a telephone call.

314
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:29,285
Okay?

315
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,953
Why are you acting so weird?

316
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,688
It was a girl.

317
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,260
Allison something. The
number is by the phone.

318
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,094
Oh, um...

319
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,499
I'm just gonna be in my
room for a second, actually.

320
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,067
We eat in ten minutes.

321
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:50,305
- <i>What?</i>
- Hey, is Allison there?

322
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:51,373
<i>No.</i>

323
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,778
<i>Who is that? Give it to me.</i>

324
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,079
<i>Who is this?</i>

325
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,113
Uh, hey, this is Zach.

326
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,715
<i>Hi, Zach. Sorry, my brother...</i>

327
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,517
No, it's cool.

328
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,123
So, wait. You called me?

329
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:06,389
<i>Yeah, um, sorry.</i>

330
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:09,926
<i>I still had your number from that
thing we did in Mrs. Moore's class,</i>

331
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,160
<i>uh, with the planets.</i>

332
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,428
With the... Yeah.

333
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,463
<i>Yeah. You know, with the song.</i>

334
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:19,835
<i>♪ Dead on a plant Where the
nuts are Mostly carbon-dioxide ♪</i>

335
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,543
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, I totally remember that.

336
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,778
<i>Yeah, cool.</i>

337
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:29,681
Cool.

338
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:32,381
<i>So, the reason I'm calling,</i>

339
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,049
<i>I'm having a birthday party thing.</i>

340
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,651
<i>I mean, it's really
more of a hangout.</i>

341
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,386
<i>Like, you don't have to bring
presents or anything like that.</i>

342
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,623
<i>But it's gonna be at Meghan's house,</i>

343
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,859
<i>and we're just gonna hang
out, watch some movies...</i>

344
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:47,430
<i>Uh, I was wondering if you
and Josh wanted to come.</i>

345
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:51,066
<i>You still hang out with
Josh Templeton, right?</i>

346
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,567
Yeah, he just left here.

347
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,636
<i>Oh, God. You guys...</i>

348
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,605
<i>Allison, get off the fucking phone!</i>

349
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:04,682
Boy!

350
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,405
Allison.

351
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:29,939
Hey, I scored your test today.

352
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,707
- You got a 96.
- What!

353
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,476
- Oh, that's great.
- That's amazing.

354
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:38,748
I know you were nervous but
your grade had one problem...

355
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,161
Yo.

356
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,633
Hey, what's up?

357
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,603
- Dude, use your locker.
- No.

358
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:01,206
That map shit you were asking for.

359
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,472
Oh, shit! I totally forg...

360
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,107
What's up, fuckers?

361
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:07,309
Hey, Daryl.

362
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,679
Hey, are you guys hanging out after school?

363
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,180
Yeah, probably.

364
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,048
Can I write "Loser" on your backpack?

365
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,182
What?

366
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:20,922
What the fuck?

367
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:24,195
Watch it, you piece of shit.

368
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,931
Bagel Bites are the best food.

369
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,801
I don't like them. They
burn the roof of my mouth.

370
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,969
Because you're doing it wrong.

371
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:37,206
Charlie's mom always keeps
the fridge stacked with these.

372
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,407
I like Charlie.

373
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,942
'Cause he's smart, his sister has big tits,

374
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:43,679
and he always has fucking snacks.

375
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,783
Where is Charlie?

376
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,116
Probably sucking a dick.

377
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,385
He said he wanted to hang out later.

378
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,321
Daryl, don't sit on the counter.

379
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,892
This fucking guy.

380
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,761
Where are your folks, Josh?

381
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,894
Well, they both work, and then

382
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:03,399
my brother usually has like
practice or lessons or something.

383
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:06,401
So no one's here until
like 5:00 or 6:00 usually.

384
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:09,104
His brother's like a total prodigy.

385
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:11,440
I thought you had an older brother.

386
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,545
Yeah, I do. Danny's in the Marines.

387
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,344
His shit's still here?

388
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,046
Shit? What do you mean "his shit"?

389
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,617
Josh, you know, his shit.

390
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,183
Oh.

391
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:23,855
This place seems fucking haunted.

392
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,689
This used to be a rec room.

393
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,691
Danny started sleeping here
after he got his job at Harveys.

394
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:30,726
Take your shoes off.

395
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,464
You gotta be kidding me, dude.

396
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:34,900
Welcome, welcome.

397
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,033
Holy shit.

398
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,100
I love this room.

399
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,403
This place is fucking incredible!

400
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,972
Look at all of them.

401
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:44,976
Holy fuck.

402
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:48,110
It's a fucking water bed.

403
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,879
You're fucking kidding me!

404
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,483
Holy shit.

405
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,452
Look at that fucking ass.

406
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,420
Is that his fucking girlfriend?

407
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,721
Look at all these fucking asses.

408
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:01,359
Holy fucking shit!

409
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,595
Holy fuck.

410
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,365
Holy fuck.

411
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:09,500
Dude, dude...

412
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,734
This is fucking weed.

413
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,836
- Can I have some?
- No, you can't have some.

414
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,006
Dude, I'll buy it off you.

415
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:19,307
This is 100 bucks worth, more maybe.

416
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,976
You should really sell this.

417
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,311
I have no idea.

418
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,180
Does pot go bad?

419
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,613
I don't think so.

420
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:28,049
Then he'll probably be looking
for it when he gets back.

421
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:29,785
I mean, it might. I don't know.

422
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,520
Dude, like a pinch. Let me get one pinch.

423
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,989
- Why?
- I've never done it before.

424
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,795
- Have you?
- No.

425
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,861
- You?
- Yeah.

426
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,228
In Colorado this one time.

427
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,764
Was it awesome?

428
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,798
I don't know. Just the
lights get really bright,

429
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
- and then your head...
- He won't know.

430
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:46,736
Not enough for him to know.

431
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,371
How long has he been gone anyway?

432
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,939
A year. I mean...

433
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,774
He has eight years of
active duty, but Christmas...

434
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:54,543
He can't even smoke weed
while he's a fucking Marine.

435
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:56,478
This isn't Vietnam or whatever.

436
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
They'll kick his ass out.

437
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,180
Please.

438
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:00,685
Please, please?

439
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:03,151
I'll think about it.

440
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:04,620
You'll think about it?

441
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,358
- That's what I said.
- Guys...

442
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,691
We should get a watermelon or something,

443
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:12,694
'cause these fucking
nunchucks are pretty badass.

444
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:14,229
Let me fucking see.

445
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:16,231
- Come get 'em.
- No, I don't feel like getting up.

446
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,732
- You're a bum
- Fuck you.

447
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:18,736
Hey, guys.

448
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,374
He's got something cooler than those.

449
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,113
How sharp is it?

450
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:33,315
Well...

451
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:35,284
It's not bamboo grade, so...

452
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,585
It's not a real, real sword, but,

453
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:39,624
it's better than just a display thing.

454
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,894
We used to fucking crush
milk cartons with this.

455
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,368
So, can we, like, do that?

456
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,903
This is so rad!

457
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,506
Yes!

458
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:03,515
Oh, here she comes. Motherfucker!

459
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,557
That's so sick.

460
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,125
Dude, do you wanna go?

461
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:19,694
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let Charlie go.

462
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,699
- Come on, let me go.
- Sure.

463
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,536
Here, use this.

464
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:26,138
Mm. Pretty sick.

465
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,106
Come on.

466
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:33,275
Come on.

467
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:34,576
Oh, fuck.

468
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:37,680
Here. Put it up on this
shit, like a tee-ball.

469
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,748
I'm not good at baseball.

470
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,484
Keep your eyes on it.

471
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,186
Take a deep breath.

472
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,421
Jesus!

473
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:49,491
The trick is you should make the
blade seem as light as possible

474
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:50,558
in your hands.

475
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,026
You all right over there?

476
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:53,461
What? Yeah.

477
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:55,698
- What's happening?
- It's nothing. Just don't worry about it.

478
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,833
What's he doing?

479
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:58,804
Daryl.

480
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:01,970
- Daryl, is that weed?
- Josh.

481
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,974
Daryl, did you take that bag
of weed from my brother's room?

482
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,241
I swear to God!

483
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,510
- Dude, it's a fucking cigarette, man.
- Let me see it.

484
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:10,679
- Daryl!
- Let me see that shit.

485
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,715
- Daryl!
- Come and get it, motherfucker.

486
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,882
Give it to me, I'm serious.

487
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,683
- You want it, come and get it.
- I'm not kidding, Daryl.

488
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:17,719
Don't fucking blow smoke in my face.

489
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,455
- Daryl, come on...
- What?

490
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,593
If you took the bag,
you should give it back.

491
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,629
You guys are fucking lame.

492
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:27,763
Lame!

493
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,265
It's all right. Calm down, Daryl.

494
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,802
- Daryl!
- Josh.

495
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,568
Daryl, come on.

496
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,803
Daryl, come on.

497
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:37,139
What the fuck, dude. Don't...

498
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:38,908
Don't do that.

499
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,077
Fuck you guys.

500
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,682
What the fuck?

501
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:46,114
- Asshole!
- Dude, he's...

502
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:47,549
Just give him a minute.

503
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:50,052
How'd you like it if I came to
your house and took all your shit?

504
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,319
Can you relax?

505
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:54,256
Oh, you don't have anything.
You live in a fucking duplex.

506
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,391
- Josh, can you stop?
- Motherfucker.

507
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,528
Just relax.

508
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,526
What?

509
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,461
Zach, thanks for inviting me out today.

510
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:02,297
Too bad your boyfriend's on the rag.

511
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,999
When you get home, make sure
to slap him around a little bit.

512
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:07,402
- Both of you just shut up.
- Keep him in fucking line.

513
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:09,171
This is stupid, all right?

514
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,709
Daryl, give me the bag.

515
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,016
Fuck!

516
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,785
Guess we should call it a day.

517
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,189
Here's your stuff, man.

518
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:26,188
Hey...

519
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,659
Dude, relax.

520
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:29,294
Relax.

521
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,799
- Daryl.
- Daryl.

522
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:39,103
Daryl!

523
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:41,336
Stop! Stop!

524
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:43,005
Guys, what the fuck are you doing?

525
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,709
- What are you doing?
- Please, this is... Stop!

526
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,811
Guys, this is just... You're
being idiots right now.

527
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,813
- Okay? Can you just...
- Guys, please stop.

528
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,514
Stop!

529
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,185
Guys, this is not a good idea.

530
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,026
Josh...

531
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:06,194
- Josh!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

532
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:08,529
- Josh, what did you...
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

533
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:09,731
Oh, my God!

534
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,499
What did you do? What are you doing?

535
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,438
I don't know. I don't know.

536
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,641
I don't know. Take it out.

537
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,808
All right. I'm gonna take it out.

538
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,344
What did you do! What did you fucking do!

539
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:24,348
What did you do!

540
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:27,615
Josh, what the fuck did you do!

541
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,086
Okay, I'm gonna pull it out.

542
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,757
No, no, no. Don't take it out!

543
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,961
You're supposed to leave it in.

544
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:42,701
Daryl.

545
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,133
What the fuck!

546
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,387
Daryl!

547
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,192
Oh, shit!

548
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:10,862
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

549
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,831
Daryl!

550
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,738
Daryl!

551
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:22,841
Daryl!

552
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:26,944
Daryl!

553
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,682
Is he...

554
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:36,354
I don't know. I don't know.

555
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,688
Zach, can you please...

556
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,489
It was an accident. Please believe me.

557
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:43,292
I know, I know.

558
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,427
I need you to calm down, okay?

559
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:46,562
I need you to calm down.

560
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,865
Zach...

561
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,235
Oh, no.

562
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,735
Daryl.

563
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,072
Daryl, are you awake?

564
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:56,407
Daryl.

565
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,948
Is he dead?

566
00:28:11,454 --> 00:28:12,389
I can't...

567
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:14,725
I can't touch you.

568
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:28,405
He's dead. We're fucked.

569
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:32,507
You stupid fuck.

570
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,382
I'm sorry.

571
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:41,752
I'm sorry!

572
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:44,719
Zach, what do we do?

573
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:47,055
I don't know... I don't know...

574
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:48,358
Zach!

575
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:50,894
Fuck!

576
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,266
Fuck.

577
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:57,868
We have to go.

578
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,469
We have to go, right now.

579
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:02,973
What are you doing?

580
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:07,375
- We gotta leave.
- What are you doing?

581
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,677
I'm covering him up.

582
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,344
It's something, right? We just gotta,

583
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:11,446
we gotta cover him up.

584
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:12,680
- Should we get help?
- No, Josh.

585
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:13,849
No one's gonna help us, all right?

586
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,387
We need to bury the body, okay?

587
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:19,790
I'm sorry, Zach.

588
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,861
Guys...

589
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:33,872
I think we should hide this too.

590
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:02,232
And his bike?

591
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,369
I'll take care of that.

592
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:26,291
Are you sure?

593
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,058
Yeah.

594
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:30,228
Just have to hide it.

595
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,265
It's getting dark.

596
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:37,902
I don't think we should both get back late.

597
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:44,274
You need to clean yourself
up before you go home.

598
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,352
Thank you.

599
00:31:33,356 --> 00:31:34,591
Oh, shit.

600
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:39,324
Oh.

601
00:32:39,722 --> 00:32:41,058
Hi.

602
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,923
Sorry, uh...

603
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:46,294
I just stopped by. Your mom
said you'd be home soon, so...

604
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,298
She went downstairs to get some Cokes.

605
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,102
God, it looks...

606
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:54,404
I was on my bike.

607
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:56,407
Are you okay?

608
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,450
Hi.

609
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:07,915
Hey.

610
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,152
Looks rough.

611
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:13,921
We have caffeine-free
Coke, if that's okay.

612
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:15,326
There he is.

613
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:17,225
You're bleeding.

614
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,563
I fell off my bike.

615
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,028
It's okay.

616
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,733
Oh, it looks nasty.

617
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:26,367
You should clean it.

618
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,568
I will.

619
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,740
Okay.

620
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,375
I'm gonna...

621
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:35,278
I'll be in my room for a second.

622
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:38,115
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

623
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,018
You can go down.

624
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,420
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

625
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:46,324
It's, uh...

626
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:48,757
- on the left.
- Okay.

627
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,661
- At the end.
- Thank you.

628
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,363
Sure.

629
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,374
I was just walking and I passed by.

630
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,208
I guess I should have called first,

631
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,175
but I didn't realize I'd
be so close to your house

632
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,845
until I saw it, and then I said,

633
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,412
"Oh, that's Zach's house.

634
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:14,552
Maybe I should stop by and scream
'penis' at the top of my lungs."

635
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,590
She's right. You should...
You should clean it.

636
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:24,258
Yeah, I'm going to.

637
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,197
You know, for now I'm just gonna do this.

638
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,474
Do you want me to go?

639
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:03,534
You okay?

640
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,637
Yeah, I just really hurt my hand.

641
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:34,731
Allison...

642
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,666
Yeah?

643
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,376
I'm sorry.

644
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:20,844
Don't apologize.

645
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:30,387
I like your room.

646
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,224
It's cool.

647
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,856
Yeah?

648
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:35,760
Yeah.

649
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:42,597
Uh... See you.

650
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,335
Bye.

651
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:50,875
Short visit then?

652
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,876
Mm-hmm.

653
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:58,348
Yeah, she has to go home.

654
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,217
She's very cute.

655
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,288
Yeah, I think so too.

656
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,596
I'm gonna go to bed.

657
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,762
It's early.

658
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,900
Yeah. I'm tired.

659
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,002
I'll probably read.

660
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,537
- Did you eat anything?
- I'm fine, Mom.

661
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,608
Okay.

662
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,744
I love you.

663
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:31,349
I love you too.

664
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:39,856
Hey, I'm cleaning those cuts.

665
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:43,427
Let's take a look.

666
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:46,260
Ow, Mom.

667
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:47,632
- That hurts?
- Yes.

668
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,566
Can you... I'm sorry.

669
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,037
- That, too?
- Yes. Please...

670
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:55,338
Well, shit.

671
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,409
I'll go get my keys.

672
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:49,393
All right. Stephanie
is here. Larry is here.

673
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,726
Scott definitely here.

674
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,030
Greg has a new haircut. Good.

675
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,563
Richard, back there.

676
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:58,465
- Emily is here.
- Here.

677
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:00,735
Zach attack is here,

678
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:06,043
but Josh Templeton is
not. Okay. That's absent.

679
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,878
Good stuff.

680
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,498
Charlie!

681
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,300
Hey, Charlie. Taking the short bus today?

682
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:34,769
Yeah, man. Short bus is
for retards like Adam.

683
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,503
Yo, man. That's super insensitive.

684
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:38,576
- Hey, we gotta talk.
- No, we don't.

685
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,543
Yeah, we do.

686
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,447
Excuse me.

687
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:46,549
I'll be right back.

688
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:49,883
Who's that dickhead?

689
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,721
I don't know. Some fuckin' dick.

690
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:54,655
Chill for a second, all right? Calm down.

691
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,826
No, just shut the fuck up
for a second, all right?

692
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,827
What?

693
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,564
Look, Josh is not coming to school.

694
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:03,067
Okay. So go talk to him.

695
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,666
Well, I am. I'm going to.

696
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:07,501
I'm just saying that we should
probably get our story straight...

697
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:09,103
There is no story, Zach.

698
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,338
Yeah, well, if somebody asks.

699
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,940
I don't remember.

700
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,807
I don't remember what I did last Tuesday.

701
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:15,709
So why would I remember
what I did this Tuesday?

702
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:17,412
Probably I went home after school,

703
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,447
stayed there alone until
my parents got home.

704
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:20,851
It's what I do most weekdays.

705
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,686
Okay, that's good.

706
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:28,389
Okay, so why did you come running
over here to the middle school

707
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,894
to talk to an eighth
grader you barely know?

708
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,928
Zach.

709
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:33,663
If anyone asks,

710
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,865
we're not friends.

711
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,885
Josh?

712
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:59,222
Josh?

713
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:03,594
Yo, Josh!

714
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:18,475
Zach?

715
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:20,478
Can I come in?

716
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:22,543
Uh, yeah.

717
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:23,913
Of course.

718
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:27,885
- Hey.
- Hey.

719
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:31,889
- How's your...
- Oh, it's good. It's better.

720
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,060
Do you remember Daryl Harper?

721
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:39,663
You two used to play together.

722
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:47,070
Yeah. But, I mean, that
was like a long time ago.

723
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:49,804
Why?

724
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,940
I had a call from his mom earlier.

725
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,541
Guess he never came home last night.

726
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:56,012
He hasn't been home yet at all.

727
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,581
Did you see him at school today?

728
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,985
I mean, I didn't see him.

729
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:07,188
But I wasn't looking for him, so...

730
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,123
I have no idea.

731
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,027
Do you remember the last
time you did see him?

732
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,099
Nope.

733
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:16,766
No.

734
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,305
His mother said something about
him going at Josh's yesterday.

735
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:26,507
Uh, no.

736
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,342
He didn't?

737
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:29,913
- At Josh's house?
- Yeah.

738
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:31,849
No.

739
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,581
No, he wasn't there.

740
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,050
- He wasn't?
- No, I was at Josh's all day.

741
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:37,588
He wasn't there. It was just us.

742
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,559
Okay.

743
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:44,894
I'll tell her.

744
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:50,900
You came home a little bit late last night.

745
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:56,139
Yeah, I guess.

746
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:58,842
Don't do that anymore.

747
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:01,976
I'm sure Daryl will turn up,

748
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:05,713
but if something happened
or some... I don't know.

749
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:08,885
Just stay close to the house
for the next few days, okay?

750
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:12,756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

751
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:47,224
<i>Tell me how... What time did you...</i>

752
00:43:55,431 --> 00:44:01,101
<i>Every one of us must fight the
struggle within our own spirit.</i>

753
00:44:01,103 --> 00:44:04,972
<i>We have to decide whether
we will define our lives</i>

754
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,376
<i>primarily based on who
we are or who we are not,</i>

755
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:14,018
<i>based on what we are for
or what we are against.</i>

756
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,993
All right. I'm awake.

757
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:29,032
All right, Mom.

758
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,068
What time is it?

759
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,454
Mom, what time is it?

760
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:54,958
Mom, what time is it?

761
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,963
Mom, what time is it?

762
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:10,407
Mom?

763
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:15,945
Mom?

764
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:49,078
Daryl?

765
00:45:51,347 --> 00:45:53,083
What are you doing here?

766
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:57,887
How did you get here, man?

767
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,983
Daryl.

768
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,425
Oh, God!

769
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:39,163
Mom!

770
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:41,463
Mom!

771
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:44,999
- What is it? What's wrong? You okay?
- My stomach...

772
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,733
- Your stomach?
- It hurts. Yeah.

773
00:46:46,735 --> 00:46:49,105
Okay, don't move. I'll be right back.

774
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:54,411
That's it. Breathe.

775
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:56,880
Count to eight.

776
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,117
There you go.

777
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,085
Better?

778
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,927
A little better.

779
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,793
You haven't eaten anything, Zach.

780
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:15,364
That's probably what's wrong.

781
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,939
I took some NyQuil.

782
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:23,373
NyQuil?

783
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:26,240
Could have been that.

784
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:28,378
Why were you taking
NyQuil? You have a cold?

785
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,146
I just can't get to sleep.

786
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:35,416
Okay. Well, no more of that, all right?

787
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,351
You can't just be taking
that stuff willy-nilly,

788
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,019
especially on an empty stomach.

789
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:03,443
Oh, my God.

790
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:05,045
Did you hear about that missing boy?

791
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:06,680
- Who?
- Daryl fucking Harper.

792
00:48:06,682 --> 00:48:08,282
Oh, my gosh.

793
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,383
- Did you hear about that missing kid?
- No shit.

794
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:11,184
Was that the guy in science class?

795
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:12,619
- Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding me?

796
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:14,387
- Oh, fuck. Daryl Harper.
- Daryl...

797
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:15,923
That guy was a piece of shit.

798
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:17,691
Daryl Harper had a filthy mouth.

799
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,463
- Probably ran away from home.
- Good riddance.

800
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:23,496
They haven't found him.

801
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:24,498
No way.

802
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,434
Oh, my gosh.

803
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,537
He's missing, man.

804
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:30,237
- Who cares?
- Are the cops involved?

805
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:31,972
Everyone hated that dude anyway.

806
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:33,641
He's gone. He disappeared.

807
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:36,679
The scrotum, which is
a soft external sac...

808
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:40,113
Class, settle down.

809
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:41,882
Next, we have the vas deferens.

810
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:45,686
The narrow tubes that carry sperm
from the testis to the seminal...

811
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,222
<i>Attention, all students.</i>

812
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:50,624
<i>This is your principal,
Dave Faith, speaking.</i>

813
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:53,327
<i>I'm sure some of you are
aware of rumors regarding</i>

814
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:55,729
<i>a missing student, Daryl Harper.</i>

815
00:48:55,731 --> 00:49:00,300
<i>I want to emphasize at this point
that they are only that, rumors.</i>

816
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:03,507
<i>We as a school will be
cooperating with the police.</i>

817
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:06,307
<i>Anyone who has any information</i>

818
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:08,342
<i>regarding Daryl and his whereabouts,</i>

819
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:09,943
<i>or even remember seeing Daryl,</i>

820
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:12,912
on the day of the 14th is
encouraged to report to my office.

821
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,682
<i>We're not looking to
get anyone in trouble,</i>

822
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:19,320
<i>only to find Daryl and return
him safely to his family.</i>

823
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,588
<i>I know we have the
holidays coming up,</i>

824
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,124
<i>but I want everyone
to be safe and careful</i>

825
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:26,594
<i>for the next few days
while we figure this out</i>

826
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,095
<i>and put this all behind us.</i>

827
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:31,599
<i>This is Principal Dave
Faith signing off.</i>

828
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,135
<i>Have a good rest of the day.</i>

829
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:39,173
- Hi, there, Zach.
- Hey, Ms. Templeton.

830
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:42,043
- Is Josh home?
- He is.

831
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,344
I've just been worried about him

832
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:44,711
since he hasn't been in school.

833
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:46,516
He hasn't been feeling well.

834
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,617
Uh, could I come in maybe and see him?

835
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:52,655
I'll ask and see if he's up for it.

836
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:55,092
That'd be great. Thank you.

837
00:49:56,492 --> 00:49:57,661
Shoes off.

838
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,364
Honey.

839
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:04,033
Josh.

840
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:06,737
Zach stopped by.

841
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:14,510
Give him a minute.

842
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:18,447
Thank you.

843
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:31,061
Josh?

844
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,030
It's Zach.

845
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,732
I know.

846
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,137
Can I come in?

847
00:50:42,538 --> 00:50:45,074
- Josh, can I come in?
- Yeah. I said okay.

848
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:54,117
Hey, man.

849
00:50:55,818 --> 00:50:57,187
I haven't seen you.

850
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,653
Yeah, Mom let me stay home.

851
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:01,191
I said I didn't feel well.

852
00:51:02,057 --> 00:51:04,224
Okay, well, I...

853
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:07,061
I don't think we should be
like acting weird or anything

854
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,398
though, right?

855
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,365
- Okay, Zach.
- Well, I'm just saying...

856
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,568
I don't think it's a good
time to be drawing attention...

857
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,539
I said okay.

858
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,742
Yeah, I'm sorry.

859
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:35,392
How are you?

860
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:40,830
Yeah.

861
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:42,766
Me too.

862
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,572
I'm not getting any sleep.

863
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:55,175
You know, my heart,

864
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:57,813
it'll just start beating
sometimes real quick.

865
00:51:58,713 --> 00:51:59,748
Speed up.

866
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:02,818
All of a sudden, just...

867
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:16,600
I feel like we should go back.

868
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,233
- Why?
- I don't know, but I...

869
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,605
To check on him, you know, to see.

870
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:25,838
I keep having these dreams

871
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,141
and I'm thinking that...

872
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,409
I don't know. I just don't think it's right

873
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:31,177
to leave Daryl out there
all alone, you know.

874
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:32,579
We got to do something with the body.

875
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:34,782
Or at least let somebody
know that he's there.

876
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,383
Be cure...

877
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:38,455
I don't know. I just
keep thinking of his mom.

878
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:41,421
You know, what's she thinking.

879
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:42,789
She's probably waiting
for him to come home.

880
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,594
Don't go back there. Scene of the crime.

881
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:51,467
Yeah.

882
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:55,568
Do you still have his stuff?

883
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,137
What?

884
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:59,005
The bag? Do you still have the bag...

885
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,708
Yeah, yeah. It's here.

886
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,742
Like, that's good.

887
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:05,447
Just, I guess... Would you
just keep that hidden here?

888
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:11,421
Yeah. It's here until I
decide to burn it or whatever.

889
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:14,954
Will you not do that?

890
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:16,123
And can you...

891
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,057
Josh, it's kind of important that you,

892
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,195
you not do something without
talking to me about it first, okay?

893
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,332
I mean...

894
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,202
If that's okay.

895
00:53:27,902 --> 00:53:28,971
Whatever.

896
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:36,213
What game is this?

897
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:44,721
Josh, what game is that?

898
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:54,597
It was a fucking accident!

899
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,633
Okay? It happened. A fucking accident.

900
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:00,503
Just...

901
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:11,681
What, are you trying to
break your other hand now?

902
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,824
Yeah, it's...

903
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:31,800
Allison Bannister is having
that party this weekend.

904
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,534
We should probably go.

905
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:35,605
Maybe.

906
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,278
I haven't gotten that
much sleep either, so...

907
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:45,949
I probably should...

908
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:52,388
That'll be good for you.

909
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:05,398
And if anybody asks, we didn't see Charlie

910
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,935
or Daryl that day, okay?

911
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:09,605
If anybody asks,

912
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,675
we're already fucked.

913
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:48,730
Zach.

914
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,067
- Zach? Hey.
- Mm.

915
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:53,166
Hey.

916
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:54,434
Try to stay with us.

917
00:57:54,436 --> 00:57:56,135
Okay?

918
00:57:56,137 --> 00:57:58,137
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

919
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:00,840
All right, everybody.
Let's turn back to page 62.

920
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,978
On top of the page. Why don't you
read the first couple of paragraphs?

921
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,347
Ms. Barron, can I go to the bathroom?

922
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:08,648
I'm not feeling so good.

923
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,751
Yeah, go ahead. Grab the pass, please.

924
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,286
Um, then we'll discuss as a class.

925
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:13,387
Boner.

926
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,757
Thank you. That's enough.

927
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,135
What? You planning on looking at my dick?

928
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:39,979
I hate reading.

929
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:41,748
I'm sure that they'll
try to give us a curfew

930
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,383
if Daryl Doofus doesn't show up soon.

931
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:46,186
That would blow.

932
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:47,887
Little biatch is ruining it for everybody.

933
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:49,088
Don't be a dick, Paul.

934
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,425
I'm just telling it how it is.

935
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,193
I don't need your fucking help, lady!

936
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:55,561
Okay, that's it. To the office.

937
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:56,697
That's nuts.

938
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,965
Oh, snap, you guys.

939
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,666
I just saw the craziest
thing in Spanish class.

940
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,200
You guys know Josh Templeton?

941
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:02,536
What did he do?

942
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:04,907
He called Mrs. Campos the "C" word.

943
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,007
I swear to God!

944
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:08,575
He came in with all attitude this morning.

945
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:10,744
Like totally ignoring her
when she called on him.

946
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:13,981
So she goes, "I don't
recall you being deaf, Josh."

947
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:17,316
And he was all, "I don't recall
you being such a dumb cunt."

948
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:20,052
What did she say?

949
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:21,487
She sent him right to the office.

950
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:23,192
- Just now?
- Yeah, like ten minutes ago.

951
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:40,240
Can I help you?

952
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:43,776
Um, my mom said to wait here.

953
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:45,545
She was gonna call me at lunch.

954
00:59:45,547 --> 00:59:47,817
So, uh... All right. Thank you.

955
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,807
Zach.

956
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,275
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Meghan.

957
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:51,545
I'm guessing this is Allison's party, yeah?

958
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,750
Yeah, this is my house though.

959
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:55,981
Great.

960
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:59,586
She said it was just gonna be
a few people watching movies.

961
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:00,954
Yeah, I know. That was the plan.

962
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:03,322
And then my grandpa got
sick, so my parents...

963
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:04,356
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

964
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:05,825
No, it's awesome.

965
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:07,262
Party on the upgrade.

966
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:09,931
Yeah, great.

967
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,168
I should probably go say
happy birthday to Allison.

968
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:17,439
Totally. Hey.

969
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:24,110
- You're doing it wrong.
- How am I doing it wrong?

970
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:26,014
This is the only way we do it.

971
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:30,550
Hey.

972
01:01:30,552 --> 01:01:32,219
Hey.

973
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:33,753
Happy birthday.

974
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:35,257
- You came.
- Of course.

975
01:01:38,092 --> 01:01:39,695
Zach. Yo.

976
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:42,195
Hey, man.

977
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:44,166
Actually, Allison. I have, um...

978
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,599
a present for you.

979
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:47,833
- What?
- If I can find it.

980
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:49,034
You didn't have to do that.

981
01:01:49,036 --> 01:01:50,138
Yeah, no one else did.

982
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:52,809
It's okay. Give it to me anyways.

983
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,045
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

984
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,414
Okay.

985
01:02:01,682 --> 01:02:03,119
What!

986
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:05,452
This is so cool.

987
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:06,856
Thank you.

988
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:12,525
Oh, my God. Okay.

989
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:14,528
I know how to do this, I think.

990
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,132
Let me see if Meghan has papers.

991
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:18,067
Sorry.

992
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:22,504
Weed? Cool.

993
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:24,406
Mm.

994
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:29,244
Josh, can I ask you something?

995
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:30,947
Yeah.

996
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,983
What's up, man?

997
01:02:37,985 --> 01:02:39,422
You didn't tell me you were coming.

998
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,091
You told me to come.

999
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,395
So, were you in school on Friday?

1000
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:48,931
Um, yeah.

1001
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:53,032
Yeah, I know.

1002
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:53,967
Hmm?

1003
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:55,702
What's up with the weed?

1004
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:57,137
What?

1005
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:59,673
Isn't your brother gonna notice
that that stuff's missing?

1006
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:00,910
Got it.

1007
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:02,541
Come on, guys.

1008
01:03:02,543 --> 01:03:03,812
Come on, man.

1009
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:07,246
Okay, it's a page from the Bible,

1010
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:08,481
but it's not an important one.

1011
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:10,483
It's like from the
introduction or something.

1012
01:03:10,485 --> 01:03:11,584
The point is, it will work.

1013
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:13,619
I've seen my brother do
it like a million times.

1014
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,387
Smells so good.

1015
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:17,224
Where'd you get this shit from, Josh?

1016
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,325
For real.

1017
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,429
Um, I know a guy.

1018
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:22,465
Can you hook me up?

1019
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:25,001
Uh, yeah.

1020
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,102
Talk to me tomorrow.

1021
01:03:27,568 --> 01:03:29,001
Cool.

1022
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:30,604
We have enough for two.

1023
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,037
But Allison gets to go twice first,

1024
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,240
because she's the birthday girl.

1025
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,740
Fuck that. It's puff, puff, pass.

1026
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:36,045
Shut up, John.

1027
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:40,148
Pass that shit.

1028
01:03:44,485 --> 01:03:47,222
I'm gonna go, actually.

1029
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:49,623
Really?

1030
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,458
Yeah. I just wanted to stop by.

1031
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,827
Cool. Bye.

1032
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,862
Have a good birthday.

1033
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:57,233
I'll see you, Josh.

1034
01:03:57,498 --> 01:03:58,433
Cool.

1035
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:01,036
Excuse me.

1036
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:11,614
Zach.

1037
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:15,317
Are you okay?

1038
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,421
Yeah. I'm not really a party person,

1039
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,990
but I wanted to say happy birthday, so...

1040
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,063
There's just a lot going on right now.

1041
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:31,601
Mm. Seems that way.

1042
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:38,373
They ran out of blue, huh?

1043
01:04:40,675 --> 01:04:42,075
"They ran out of blue"? What?

1044
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:45,581
- Your cast, it's pink.
- Oh, oh. Duh. Yeah.

1045
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,883
It's nice. It suits you.

1046
01:04:50,885 --> 01:04:52,288
Sensitive boy.

1047
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:56,055
Well, if you got a lot going on,

1048
01:04:56,057 --> 01:05:00,592
why don't you come back
inside and hang out?

1049
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:02,998
Smoke. You know. Relax a little.

1050
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,068
I don't really do that.

1051
01:05:07,768 --> 01:05:09,437
Smoke, you know...

1052
01:05:11,706 --> 01:05:12,938
And honestly, neither does Josh.

1053
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,176
I think he just did that
to fucking impress you.

1054
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,514
Which is lame, you know.

1055
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:23,816
I'm sorry, Allison...

1056
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:25,251
Oh, fuck!

1057
01:05:25,253 --> 01:05:27,354
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1058
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:28,787
It's all right.

1059
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:35,130
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1060
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:37,699
You got a bump on your head.

1061
01:05:57,619 --> 01:05:58,988
Why don't you kiss me?

1062
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,094
I can't. I'm sorry.

1063
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:10,329
I'm so sorry, Allison.

1064
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:11,433
It's okay.

1065
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:20,308
I've just gotta go.

1066
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:21,509
Okay.

1067
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:24,413
I hope you have a great birthday.

1068
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,582
Thank you.

1069
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:09,789
Psst. Hey.

1070
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,824
What's up?

1071
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,758
Yo, dude. You hear that shit?

1072
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,026
What shit?

1073
01:07:14,028 --> 01:07:16,628
That guy, he's dead.

1074
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:18,130
They found him dead.

1075
01:07:18,132 --> 01:07:19,532
Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

1076
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:22,869
- It's John Whitcomb.
- Wait. John Whitcomb is dead?

1077
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:24,470
<i>Dude with with blue hair.</i>

1078
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:26,171
When? When the fuck did this happen?

1079
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:27,273
They found him yesterday.

1080
01:07:27,275 --> 01:07:28,677
He fell off the bridge.

1081
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:31,978
- Fuck!
- I know.

1082
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,384
I had algebra with him.
Small fucking world.

1083
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:38,617
Yeah, it seems to be.

1084
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:41,387
I was supposed to buy some
weed from him today too.

1085
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:43,358
He said he was going to
hook up from some other dude.

1086
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:46,128
I'm not getting my weed.

1087
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:48,760
Hey...

1088
01:07:48,762 --> 01:07:50,065
You got some weed?

1089
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,369
Yo, you got some weed?

1090
01:07:55,402 --> 01:07:57,806
Hey, you got some weed?

1091
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:09,085
I walked in on him once

1092
01:08:09,951 --> 01:08:11,751
in the bathroom.

1093
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:14,423
In the bus bathroom on that trip to
the Flight Museum. Do you remember that?

1094
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:18,160
No, I didn't go.

1095
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:19,795
Oh.

1096
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:22,327
Well...

1097
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:23,963
He didn't lock the door for some reason,

1098
01:08:23,965 --> 01:08:26,098
and I saw everything.

1099
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,569
Full Whitcomb.

1100
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:30,673
Mm.

1101
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:36,644
You're friends with Tig, right?

1102
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:39,144
Who?

1103
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:40,582
Carol Barth.

1104
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:43,183
Yeah, sort of.

1105
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:45,518
Do you have her number?

1106
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,456
Somewhere at home. I'd have to look it up.

1107
01:08:48,055 --> 01:08:49,858
Here. Got a marker?

1108
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,827
Yeah.

1109
01:08:56,997 --> 01:08:58,867
We're gonna take that...

1110
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:10,880
Trade.

1111
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:15,113
So, what's this?

1112
01:09:15,115 --> 01:09:16,915
It's my new number.

1113
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,651
My own line.

1114
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:20,285
Mom and Dad's birthday present.

1115
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:22,390
So I don't have to deal
with my brother anymore.

1116
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,526
Call tonight and I'll dig hers up for you.

1117
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:28,364
If you tell me why you want it.

1118
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:33,501
Did you just buy those?

1119
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,135
Is that okay?

1120
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:39,207
You know, I don't wanna
scare you off again.

1121
01:09:40,507 --> 01:09:42,944
I'm messing with you, dummy.

1122
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,449
Okay. Come on.

1123
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:50,519
Walk me home.

1124
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,219
I broke my arm once.

1125
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:57,956
Is it hard to ride, you
know, with your pink cast?

1126
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,192
No, not really.

1127
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:00,696
Braking's hard.

1128
01:10:02,096 --> 01:10:03,932
My mom used to have a Schwinn bike.

1129
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:06,598
This is my mom's bike.

1130
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,000
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:09,470
Oh, no way.

1132
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:10,940
That's cute.

1133
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:15,678
You really don't think it's weird?

1134
01:10:16,744 --> 01:10:17,813
What?

1135
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:21,283
That John...

1136
01:10:22,216 --> 01:10:24,150
He fell.

1137
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:26,218
People fuck around on
the bridge all the time.

1138
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,986
It just makes sense
that someone would fall.

1139
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:29,522
Yeah, but...

1140
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:30,960
What if he didn't fall?

1141
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:36,798
Oh, my God.

1142
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,935
You think he jumped?

1143
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:45,271
I don't know.

1144
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:46,571
Maybe. It means you're right.

1145
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:48,741
It's not weird I guess, right?

1146
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:50,643
Why do you care so much?

1147
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:53,349
God. Wow, I sound like such a dick.

1148
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:55,548
Don't I?

1149
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,483
Why do you care so much a
kid in our class is dead?

1150
01:10:58,485 --> 01:11:01,153
And that kid Daryl's still missing.

1151
01:11:01,155 --> 01:11:04,456
I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep
bringing it up either. It's just...

1152
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,694
I don't really feel like I have
anyone to talk to right now.

1153
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:08,964
It's my fault, isn't it?

1154
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:13,768
Um, what?

1155
01:11:16,136 --> 01:11:18,071
You and Josh?

1156
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,440
I mean, I could tell you two were...

1157
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,844
Well, he's got a thing for me.

1158
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,516
I like you, Zach.

1159
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:30,451
A lot sometimes.

1160
01:11:37,024 --> 01:11:38,426
Well, this is me.

1161
01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:41,429
You already knew that.

1162
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,636
Do you wanna come inside?

1163
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,426
Hey, Mom.

1164
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:20,536
Mom, are you home?

1165
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:33,412
<i>Hey, honey. I'm gonna
be home a little late,</i>

1166
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:36,516
<i>so eat whatever you feel
like and don't go anywhere.</i>

1167
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,049
<i>I'll be home as soon as I can.</i>

1168
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:39,420
<i>Love you.</i>

1169
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,622
<i>Bye.</i>

1170
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,536
Oh, shit.

1171
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,850
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, it's Zach.</i>

1172
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:18,519
<i>So, could I have that number?</i>

1173
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,120
What number?

1174
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,025
<i>Charlie... uh, Carol
Barth. Her number.</i>

1175
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:26,392
Uh, yeah.

1176
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:28,130
Okay, just one second.

1177
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:30,396
Asshole.

1178
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:34,670
Fuck. Fuck.

1179
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:38,236
Barth residence.

1180
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:39,474
Charlie, it's Zach.

1181
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:42,040
How did you get my number?

1182
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,011
Don't worry about that
now, all right? Just listen.

1183
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:46,747
I think it's Josh.

1184
01:14:47,748 --> 01:14:49,749
You think what's Josh?

1185
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,150
I think he killed John Whitcomb.

1186
01:14:51,152 --> 01:14:52,617
<i>What the hell, Zach?</i>

1187
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:54,286
<i>No, I need to talk to somebody who
knows and you're the only one who does.</i>

1188
01:14:54,288 --> 01:14:55,754
<i>So just like fucking let me
work this out, all right?</i>

1189
01:14:55,756 --> 01:14:57,357
- What?
- Okay.

1190
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,825
So fuckin' Daryl gags at a bit of fuckin'
Josh's weed, and he loses his shit.

1191
01:14:59,827 --> 01:15:02,594
<i>But then the other night, all of a
sudden, Josh just like gives it all away</i>

1192
01:15:02,596 --> 01:15:04,095
<i>to some girl as a gift.</i>

1193
01:15:04,097 --> 01:15:06,201
<i>But then he says he's gonna
sell some to John Whitcomb.</i>

1194
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:09,902
- So?
- So, like a fucking week ago,

1195
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:12,037
<i>Josh is talking about how much
he fucking hates John Whitcomb,</i>

1196
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:13,705
<i>and all of a sudden he's
gonna sell him weed?</i>

1197
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:15,974
<i>And then all of a sudden
John Whitcomb turns up dead</i>

1198
01:15:15,976 --> 01:15:18,311
at the exact same fucking spot
where we were all hanging out?

1199
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,013
<i>I mean, it's just a little too
fucking coincidental, don't you think?</i>

1200
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:23,281
All right, so he's
acting weird. So are you.

1201
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:24,317
So am I, probably.

1202
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,718
I know. But I couldn't
stop thinking about it.

1203
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,519
So I decided to go out where Daryl is,

1204
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:28,620
<i>and it's fucking different.</i>

1205
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:30,022
Wait, wait, wait...

1206
01:15:30,024 --> 01:15:32,357
You're saying you went back out there?

1207
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:35,760
- What the...
- The sword is gone.

1208
01:15:35,762 --> 01:15:37,263
Someone took it. I looked, I checked.

1209
01:15:37,265 --> 01:15:38,263
It's not fucking there.

1210
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:40,031
Someone has taken the sword.

1211
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:42,268
Why would you go back up to the woods?

1212
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,202
You know that three people
know about that sword, right?

1213
01:15:44,204 --> 01:15:45,571
You, me, and Josh.

1214
01:15:45,573 --> 01:15:47,639
<i>And I don't think he
went out there alone.</i>

1215
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:49,508
- No.
- No.

1216
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,977
I think Josh did. I think he went there,

1217
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,678
<i>he took the sword, he
fucked with Daryl's body,</i>

1218
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,414
<i>and then he went and pushed John
Whitcomb off the fucking bridge.</i>

1219
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,383
And now I have no idea where he is,

1220
01:15:57,385 --> 01:16:00,052
<i>'cause he won't answer any
of my fucking phone calls.</i>

1221
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:01,553
It's so fucked up.

1222
01:16:01,555 --> 01:16:03,089
<i>I know, man.</i>

1223
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,657
Why would you add all this extra
nonsense onto the situation?

1224
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:07,393
Isn't it bad enough as it is?

1225
01:16:07,395 --> 01:16:10,196
<i>You are not listening, Charlie.</i>

1226
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:11,397
Daryl is dead.

1227
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:12,732
Charlie, Charlie. Listen, all right?

1228
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,232
<i>Josh, or fucking somebody else,</i>

1229
01:16:14,234 --> 01:16:16,268
they went up there, and
if they found Daryl alive,

1230
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,570
they fucking finished him off.

1231
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:19,205
And if they didn't and they found him dead,

1232
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,240
well, then they were just fucking
hacking at his dead fucking body.

1233
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:22,607
What, so it was Josh?

1234
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:24,011
He's your friend, isn't he?

1235
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:26,544
Of course he is.

1236
01:16:26,546 --> 01:16:28,546
Then why go out of your way

1237
01:16:28,548 --> 01:16:29,815
to put this on him?

1238
01:16:29,817 --> 01:16:31,616
Is this not concerning? I mean,
where is the fucking sword?

1239
01:16:31,618 --> 01:16:32,718
- Do you have it?
- No.

1240
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,952
Did you take it?

1241
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:35,521
How do we know you didn't take it?

1242
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:37,289
How do we know if it's even gone?

1243
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,724
You wanna take me back
out there and show me?

1244
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:41,227
Lure me back out there?

1245
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,827
<i>No thank you.</i>

1246
01:16:42,829 --> 01:16:44,162
Charlie, you need to listen.

1247
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:46,667
<i>No, I don't. You need
to listen to yourself.</i>

1248
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:48,970
You're fucking losing it, dude.

1249
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,306
Don't call me again.

1250
01:17:04,652 --> 01:17:06,054
Ah, shit!

1251
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:09,690
<i>I didn't want you to see this, Mama.</i>

1252
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,235
Look who I found.

1253
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:22,637
Yo.

1254
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:25,640
Hey.

1255
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:28,175
I got chicken.

1256
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,478
I already ate. You told me to eat whatever.

1257
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,016
- Oh, I did?
- Yeah.

1258
01:17:36,317 --> 01:17:39,684
Oh. Well, then we'll reheat.

1259
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:40,820
Josh, you want some chicken?

1260
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,356
I'm fine. I shouldn't stay long.

1261
01:17:45,726 --> 01:17:47,863
- Do you wanna...
- Yeah.

1262
01:17:49,997 --> 01:17:52,363
We're gonna be outside for a sec.

1263
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:53,969
- Don't go far.
- I won't.

1264
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,012
So what are you doing here?

1265
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,316
I don't know, dude. Just hanging out.

1266
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:18,060
I'm sorry I ditched you at Allison's.

1267
01:18:20,494 --> 01:18:23,331
Yeah, she was pretty bummed.

1268
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,370
What? What are you doing?
Are you like afraid of me now?

1269
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,809
No, I'm not afraid of
you. There's just some...

1270
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,517
Josh, I went off to the woods again.

1271
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,718
- What?
- Yeah, and I saw that someone took the sword.

1272
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,919
Did you talk to Charlie?

1273
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:49,455
Obviously I fucking talked to Charlie.

1274
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:50,656
Okay, why are you yelling at me?

1275
01:18:50,658 --> 01:18:51,891
I'm not... I wasn't yelling at you.

1276
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:52,958
- Yes, you were.
- I wasn't yelling.

1277
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,396
Look... Okay, Josh, this is...

1278
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,830
Look, we need to be talking.

1279
01:18:58,832 --> 01:18:59,999
Like really talking.

1280
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,634
Not like you showing
up at my house sometimes

1281
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,406
and bumping into each other
at a fucking party, like...

1282
01:19:05,405 --> 01:19:06,805
We're friends.

1283
01:19:06,807 --> 01:19:08,206
And I need my friend back, you know.

1284
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:09,674
Because we're in this shit together.

1285
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:10,843
Whose number is that?

1286
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:13,144
Josh, I'm willing to draw a line.

1287
01:19:13,146 --> 01:19:15,113
Really. I'm willing to
fucking put everything,

1288
01:19:15,115 --> 01:19:16,281
like what happened with Daryl,

1289
01:19:16,283 --> 01:19:18,017
and what maybe happened
with John Whitcomb...

1290
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,285
What are you talking about what
happened with John Whitcomb?

1291
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:22,423
Lower your voice. My
mom is inside, all right?

1292
01:19:23,256 --> 01:19:24,857
Look, I... We...

1293
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:27,863
We can forget about all that stuff and...

1294
01:19:28,662 --> 01:19:30,329
Look, I know how you feel.

1295
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:33,965
No, you fucking don't
know how I feel, okay?

1296
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:35,701
All you fucking do is say a bunch of shit

1297
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:38,774
that you think sounds nice,
because you're scared all the time.

1298
01:19:40,574 --> 01:19:41,842
Well, you're wrong.

1299
01:19:42,976 --> 01:19:45,046
And you're wrong about me too.

1300
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,532
He left?

1301
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:09,268
Wish you would have told
me. I could have driven him.

1302
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,139
No, he can take care of himself.

1303
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:17,311
They found that Whitcomb boy.

1304
01:20:19,512 --> 01:20:21,917
Daryl's still missing. It's just too much.

1305
01:20:24,118 --> 01:20:26,121
I keep thinking if I was their mother...

1306
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:30,225
Come here.

1307
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,559
- Mom.
- Come here.

1308
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:36,230
Fucking hug me.

1309
01:20:36,596 --> 01:20:37,898
Jesus.

1310
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:48,943
I love you, sweetie.

1311
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,012
I love you.

1312
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:57,452
<i>Don't hurt me, please!</i>

1313
01:21:45,265 --> 01:21:46,268
Hello!

1314
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:06,588
Josh?

1315
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:21,101
Josh?

1316
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:33,315
Fuck.

1317
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,388
Where did he put it?

1318
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:42,023
Where is it?

1319
01:23:03,077 --> 01:23:04,980
Oh, you can't trick me.

1320
01:23:21,828 --> 01:23:22,997
Oh, shit.

1321
01:23:45,886 --> 01:23:47,422
- Hey.
- Hey, Josh.

1322
01:23:48,122 --> 01:23:49,687
- Allison.
- Hey.

1323
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:50,724
How's it going?

1324
01:23:51,891 --> 01:23:53,424
Fine.

1325
01:23:53,426 --> 01:23:55,093
What's with the beach towel?

1326
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:56,430
It's a surprise.

1327
01:23:57,664 --> 01:23:59,634
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

1328
01:24:01,868 --> 01:24:03,337
You should come in.

1329
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:06,140
I'd love to.

1330
01:24:11,311 --> 01:24:13,478
- What?
- Is Allison here?

1331
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,713
Who wants to know?

1332
01:24:14,715 --> 01:24:16,882
I do.

1333
01:24:16,884 --> 01:24:19,050
- A mess...
- Yeah. I know. Please don't do that right now.

1334
01:24:19,052 --> 01:24:20,318
Right, so she's not here?

1335
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,053
- Nah.
- So where is she?

1336
01:24:22,055 --> 01:24:24,089
She left with the bitch
from down the street.

1337
01:24:24,091 --> 01:24:25,260
What bitch?

1338
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:27,092
Meghan whatever.

1339
01:24:27,094 --> 01:24:29,061
Okay. And where are they?

1340
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:30,629
Her house, I guess.

1341
01:24:30,631 --> 01:24:31,699
Was there a guy with them?

1342
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,831
Fuck off.

1343
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:35,836
No, please. You don't
understand. Right now you can't...

1344
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:07,534
Excuse me.

1345
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:14,342
Uh, you got a little something.

1346
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,448
So?

1347
01:25:20,914 --> 01:25:22,246
So, so.

1348
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:24,152
So, you went to that guy.

1349
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:26,186
How much and how much?

1350
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:31,259
This much and it's on the house.

1351
01:25:32,725 --> 01:25:34,461
No fucking way.

1352
01:25:36,029 --> 01:25:37,929
Your guy is awesome.

1353
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:39,533
Fuck that. I am the guy.

1354
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:46,341
You rule.

1355
01:25:47,106 --> 01:25:48,542
Thank you.

1356
01:25:49,976 --> 01:25:52,110
Zach isn't coming, is he?

1357
01:25:52,112 --> 01:25:54,649
Uh, no. He can't make it, unfortunately.

1358
01:25:55,949 --> 01:25:59,220
So what? More for us. Come on.

1359
01:26:06,226 --> 01:26:08,296
- Alrighty.
- Alrighty.

1360
01:26:08,962 --> 01:26:10,861
Ladies first.

1361
01:26:10,863 --> 01:26:12,166
Thank you.

1362
01:26:31,685 --> 01:26:32,887
Shit.

1363
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:46,764
Meghan, your mom's Chardonnay is shit.

1364
01:26:46,766 --> 01:26:49,233
Yeah, she's cheap for being so rich.

1365
01:26:49,235 --> 01:26:50,738
Where did she get it from?

1366
01:26:51,438 --> 01:26:52,704
Yeah.

1367
01:26:52,706 --> 01:26:54,208
The gas station.

1368
01:26:56,109 --> 01:26:57,476
Josh, don't.

1369
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,644
Sorry.

1370
01:26:59,646 --> 01:27:01,216
Yeah, it's rude.

1371
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,452
Sorry.

1372
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:08,419
Josh.

1373
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:09,888
- I'm good.
- You sure?

1374
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,656
Mm-hmm.

1375
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,089
I thought we were hanging out.

1376
01:27:12,091 --> 01:27:13,360
We are.

1377
01:27:17,363 --> 01:27:19,333
So, Josh, what's the surprise this time?

1378
01:27:22,502 --> 01:27:24,505
What the fuck is that?

1379
01:27:25,104 --> 01:27:26,204
It's a fucking sword.

1380
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:27,772
That's the surprise?

1381
01:27:27,774 --> 01:27:29,141
That's the surprise.

1382
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,808
Can I see it?

1383
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:31,643
You're looking at it.

1384
01:27:31,645 --> 01:27:33,615
No. Like, can I play with it?

1385
01:27:41,755 --> 01:27:43,690
This is fucking awesome.

1386
01:27:44,123 --> 01:27:45,693
Ooh! Okay.

1387
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:51,566
Meghan, you look like Zelda.

1388
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:55,701
Zelda's the princess.

1389
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,269
Oh. Sorry.

1390
01:27:58,271 --> 01:28:00,541
Whatever, man. It's all the same anyway.

1391
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:04,511
That's not true. It's not all the same.

1392
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,045
Mm.

1393
01:28:08,047 --> 01:28:09,416
The sun feels good.

1394
01:28:10,317 --> 01:28:11,551
Let me see.

1395
01:28:11,952 --> 01:28:12,954
No.

1396
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:26,366
You like that?

1397
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,703
It's fucking rad.

1398
01:28:38,444 --> 01:28:39,713
All right. My turn.

1399
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,025
Josh.

1400
01:30:34,828 --> 01:30:37,432
Josh, you fucking fuck! Open the door!

1401
01:30:39,432 --> 01:30:40,701
Josh!

1402
01:30:46,873 --> 01:30:48,639
Help! Help!

1403
01:30:48,641 --> 01:30:51,445
He's killing them! Help!

1404
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:09,831
Josh!

1405
01:32:15,328 --> 01:32:16,628
I'm gonna go get help, all right?

1406
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,696
I'm gonna be right back.

1407
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,300
Just keep breathing, all right?

1408
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:09,984
Oh, shit!

1409
01:33:17,524 --> 01:33:18,589
Josh!

1410
01:33:46,019 --> 01:33:48,218
Josh, what the fuck are you doing?

1411
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:49,389
Is she dead?

1412
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,860
Fuck you, man. What...

1413
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:01,299
Yo, what's happening? We're friends.

1414
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:02,837
Remember? We're...

1415
01:34:04,671 --> 01:34:07,108
You're my... You're my best friend.

1416
01:34:09,609 --> 01:34:11,145
Please...

1417
01:34:12,045 --> 01:34:13,279
I love you.

1418
01:34:15,114 --> 01:34:16,149
Fuck.

1419
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:34,491
Fuck! Get off him! Get off him!

1420
01:35:34,493 --> 01:35:35,962
Move it! Stop it!

1421
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:38,298
Stop!

1422
01:35:41,801 --> 01:35:43,269
Stay back... Get him...

1423
01:36:18,137 --> 01:36:20,207
Zach, look at me. Look at me.

1424
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:23,508
One, two...

1425
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:25,076
Okay? What's hurting you?

1426
01:36:25,078 --> 01:36:26,547
Here. It's hurting here.

1427
01:36:28,681 --> 01:36:30,050
Can you hold that, please?

1428
01:36:34,753 --> 01:36:37,388
Are they gonna be okay?

1429
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:39,022
Let me grab a pad for you.

1430
01:36:39,024 --> 01:36:40,525
Are they gonna be okay?

1431
01:36:40,527 --> 01:36:41,659
Keep looking at me, okay?

1432
01:36:41,661 --> 01:36:42,896
Don't look away.

1433
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:47,432
Can you take a deep breath?

1434
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:48,969
Take a real nice one, okay?

1435
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,102
