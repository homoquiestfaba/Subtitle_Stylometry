[cell phone buzzing]

3
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,707
Stop calling me
every 15 minutes.

4
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,710
If you gave me updates,
I wouldn't have to.

5
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,128
<i>There's nothing to update.</i>

6
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:30,216
I'm on my third bag of pork rinds,
still freezing my ass off up here,

7
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,093
and Cusamano still
hasn't made the arrest.

8
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,595
He told me five minutes,
six minutes ago.

9
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,556
<i>Well, maybe he stopped
to tie his shoe.</i>

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,892
Yeah, maybe.

11
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:43,479
Or maybe he's trying to
sabotage my entire operation.

12
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,482
Either way, if he doesn't show, I need
you to bring in Laura Lake tonight.

13
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,235
Zero, this is not my mission.

14
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,862
<i>If the colonel knew I was
interfering this much...</i>

15
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,365
I wouldn't ask if it
wasn't important, B.

16
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,284
Laura Lake needs
to go down tonight.

17
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,202
<i>We deal with protocol later.</i>

18
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,704
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

19
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:03,124
<i>- Please.</i>
- Let's just hope he shows, huh?

20
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,542
Let's hope so.

21
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,503
All right, keep me
posted. I gotta go.

22
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,921
Let's go. Gear up!

23
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,007
[tense music playing]

24
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:58,971
- What's up?
- No time to explain. Just follow me.

25
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:02,516
- Okay, let me go to my locker...
- There's no time. Let's go.

26
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,686
Simon, good. You know.

27
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,063
Know what?

28
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,273
- Her camera, it's...
- Yeah, yeah.

29
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,526
I got it. Thanks,
Manny. I got it.

30
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,611
Okay.

31
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,871
[tense music continues]

32
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,842
- What is going on?
- Sorry, no time to explain.

33
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,012
My number's in the pocket. Call
me when you're somewhere safe.

34
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,015
- Just run.
- I can't...

35
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,351
Don't look back. Go, go.

36
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,908
[Brandon] That's the friendliest
arrest I've ever seen.

37
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,165
Okay, Zero's not paranoid.

38
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,167
That looks shady as hell.

39
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,337
Okay, that was an
update from the boss.

40
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,297
Feds are 30 minutes out.
We need to move now.

41
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,842
We've all been preparing
for this. Time to get ugly.

42
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,885
Gildie, you got the easy
job. Head to the roof.

43
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,345
- Want me to go with him?
- Gildie?

44
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,139
Need your big brother
to hold your hand?

45
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,723
- Think I'll manage.
- [Dax] Good.

46
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,643
- Hey, where were you?
- I had an issue with one of the cameras.

47
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,062
Why are you fixing cameras?
Break everything down.

48
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,815
- I know...
- I don't care! Okay? Stop fixing shit.

49
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,568
Wipe the drives. Make
us disappear. You two...

50
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,195
We're running low on time. We
need all the hands we can get.

51
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,613
Don't hurt yourselves.

52
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,744
[tense music playing]

53
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,135
Nerds.

54
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,345
Tell us when.

55
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,349
Now.

56
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,035
[women screaming]

57
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,970
ETA?

58
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,973
Twenty-seven minutes.
Rescue Squad is 15 behind.

59
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,061

62
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,397
Easy job.

63
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,638
[Dax] We're missing someone.

64
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,725
She snuck through a vent.
Gildie got her. I checked.

65
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,227
Nerds, where are we?

66
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,606
We're good.

67
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,149
<i>Okay, let's move out.</i>

68
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,328
[line dialing]

69
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,121
[Brandon] Come on.

70
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,416
Come on.

71
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,668
Oh, now you don't answer?

72
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,694
[explosion]

73
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,658
[dramatic music playing]

74
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,961
Someone tipped them off.

75
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,504
Place is empty.

76
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,970
Look at them.

77
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,306
It's not fucking empty.

78
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,059
Anything?

79
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,185
[cell phone buzzing]

80
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,270
Goddamn.

81
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:26,358
Hey. If you tell me Cusamano still
hasn't shown up, I'm gonna lose it.

82
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:30,028
Well, he showed up, but
he didn't make the arrest.

83
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,158
He shook her hand, put her in a
car, and sent her on her way, so...

84
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,535
I arrested him.

85
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,425
[rock music playing]

86
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,457
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

87
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:13,549
Harvey Cusamano is the Deputy Chief
of the United States Border Patrol.

88
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,511
You don't just arrest
him on a hunch.

89
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,471
- It was more than a hunch.
- Shut up.

90
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,889
And, by the way,

91
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,976
CIA officers don't
actually make arrests.

92
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,145
- Just so you know.
- It was a citizen's arrest.

93
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,981
Shut up.

94
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,734
You know how many phone
calls I made this morning

95
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,196
because you think you're James
Bond after two months on the job?

96
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,447
Three months, sir.

97
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,033
And everyone knows that
James Bond was MI6.

98
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,786
- Shut up?
- Please.

99
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,800
Brandon, you convinced me to
bring you into the company,

100
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,135
so you could settle down.

101
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,345
I'm trying to retire.

102
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,182
I'm only sticking around to
watch you get your feet wet.

103
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,601
Your feet wet.

104
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,352
Not to go swimming in shit.

105
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,230
Listen to me.

106
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,065
You've led an exciting life.

107
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,486
But this is the
land of red tape.

108
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,865
The name Laura Lake
mean anything to you?

109
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,534
In Virginia? Beautiful
this time of year.

110
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,244
What? No.

111
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,166
Laura Lake is the CEO of Sigma
Oasis Innovations here in London.

112
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,710
Publicly, anyway.

113
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,672
In her spare time, she runs a
sex-trafficking ring in the U.S.

114
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,759
She smuggles women
across the border

115
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,720
in the back of shipping
containers full of computer parts.

116
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,513
And they had her.

117
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,642
Zero was running
operations stateside.

118
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,061
And Cusamano was in
charge over here.

119
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,440
One thing they couldn't figure out
was, how was she clearing the docks?

120
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,902
Getting these containers past
Immigration and Coast Guard?

121
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,986
Zero...

122
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,074
Zero asked me to keep
an eye on Cusamano.

123
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:06,161
I don't know if he thought
he was dirty or negligent,

124
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,871
but he didn't trust him.

125
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,456
And he was right.

126
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,043
Sneaking these women
in is a lot easier

127
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,170
if you have a border patrol
chief in your pocket.

128
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,421
[knocking on door]

129
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,589
Come in.

130
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,592
[ominous music playing]

131
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:21,676
Oh.

132
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,555
Did I make it just in time to
see you hand over your badge?

133
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,349
[Stone] I'm handling
this, thank you.

134
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,268
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

135
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,623
[Cusamano] It was a
poorly timed joke.

136
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:38,110
He pulls the cuffs a bit too
tight, but, uh, other than that,

137
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,861
no real inconvenience.

138
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,406
Like I said, we apologize.

139
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,742
And I promise,
action will be taken.

140
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,037
Honestly, no action
necessary on my behalf.

141
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,417
Your pal Zero and
I don't get along,

142
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,711
but I don't believe in
guilt by association.

143
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,380
So let's clear the
slate. Start fresh.

144
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,717
You were spying on me.

145
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,761
Water under the bridge.

146
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,681
Now tell me what
you think you saw.

147
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,809
What led to my
ill-advised arrest?

148
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,937
I saw Laura Lake getting away.

149
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,482
Didn't look like you
were trying to stop her.

150
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,027
The opposite, in fact.

151
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,196
But...

152
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,950
after having a night
to sleep on it,

153
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,076
I realize...

154
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,873
I was too far away and my
vantage point was obscured,

155
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,542
so I don't really
know what I saw.

156
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,547
She didn't get away.

157
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,425
Well, not for long.

158
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,680
Apparently, she knew her time was
up, knew I was closing in on her.

159
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,725
So she decided to end
things on her own terms.

160
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,728
We found her early this
morning in her bathtub.

161
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,315
Pills. Tragic.

162
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,360
Gabriel, I'll send you the full
report when I'm back at my desk.

163
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,990
It's not the way we
wanted it to go down.

164
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,077
I know Zero's upset.
He needed her alive.

165
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,496
She's the key to our case.

166
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,541
But, nevertheless, there are
protocols. Your involvement was...

167
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,671
Perhaps you'll understand
a more youthful parlance.

168
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,258
- Stay in your lane, Sergeant Beckett.
- [Stone] Okay.

169
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,720
He will. Thanks for dropping by.

170
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,142
- I'll send that report.
- You do that.

171
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,611
Unfortunately, I'm
gonna need your badge.

172
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,698
- He's full of shit, sir.
- I'm sure he is.

173
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,578
It's the land of red tape, son.

174
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,714
No, you're not even
trying. Not even trying.

175
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,343
- I didn't even get set.
- Put your hands up. We playing here?

176
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,929
- You flinched.
- You moved. I didn't flinch.

177
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,266
- You flinched. Give me your hand.
- Hey, hey, cut it out.

178
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,810
Jesus. Hey, Rosie. Um...

179
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,730
Do me a favor, okay?
Uh, count to ten.

180
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm serious. Count
to ten. Come on.

181
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,905
No? It's tough, I get it.

182
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,073
I get it. Gildie?

183
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:31,992
Wanna give it a shot?

184
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,287
No? No? Simon?

185
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,542
Come on, guys, anyone wanna take a stab
at counting from one to fucking ten?

186
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,085
Nobody?

187
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,963
I mean, that explains it.

188
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,633
That explains why we only
killed nine fucking girls!

189
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,887
Now Mary Jane is at
the police station.

190
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,847
There's a fed on the
way to pick her up.

191
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,851
So you two dip shits are gonna go
clean this up. And do me a favor.

192
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,021
Grab a calculator, get some
flashcards, a fucking abacus.

193
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,732
Just learn how to
count on the way there.

194
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,067
And, Gildie, don't
be a pussy, okay?

195
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,362
You flinched. Give your
brother a free one. Come on.

196
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,115
Ah!

197
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,909
[Dax] It's the spirit
of the game, Gildie!

198
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,994
[upbeat music playing]

199
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,737
This is it.

200
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,952
What's the matter? Don't see
any tall buildings to perch on?

201
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,036
No, I don't.

202
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,415
Why don't you go in with your knives
and take care of it? That'll go well.

203
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,376
I can fit a knife in my pocket.

204
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,128
Rooftop's a little tricky
to carry around with you.

205
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,590
Yeah? Well, luckily, I don't need
to be 6 inches from my target.

206
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,843
We passed a parking garage by
city hall. Let's head there.

207
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,661
Zeke Rosenberg,
Homeland Security.

208
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,746
Hi, my friends call me Zero.

209
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,417
Man, I am so happy
to find you alive.

210
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,929
Sure hope the soccer mom in
this minivan doesn't show up.

211
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,599
That's why you're here. Keep a
lookout and give me a heads-up.

212
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,769
Yeah, or we could be in that
empty corner over there.

213
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:05,979
I already told you,

214
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,274
I don't have a shot from
there, so just watch my back.

215
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,362
Okay, now, it
doesn't matter how,

216
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:19,034
but if any of these guys look
familiar at all, you tell me, okay?

217
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,589
Him.

218
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,843
- Him? You've seen this guy?
- Mm-hm.

219
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,016
Okay, now, uh, this
guy who let you go,

220
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,436
this Simon character, do you
have any way of contacting him?

221
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,730
Uh, I have his number. Um...

222
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,773
It's right...

223
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,529
Can we get the clothes that
she came in with, please?

224
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,739
Weren't any.

225
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,749
- Did you knit that beanie?
- What?

226
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,291
No.

227
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,169
You and Mom don't knit anymore?

228
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:15,048
No, we don't knit anymore, not since
that one time when I was like 8.

229
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,301
You were really good at it.
Sick of you being so defensive.

230
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,680
- It was more like 13.
- Can you shut up, so I can concentrate?

231
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,141
Concentrate? She's
a sitting duck.

232
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,186
If it's so goddamn easy,
why don't you do it?

233
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,438
Calm down. I didn't say
it'd be easy for me.

234
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,002
- I figured it'd be easy for you, since...
- [car alarm chirps]

235
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,659
[ominous music playing]

236
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,499
Excuse me. Can I get
your badge number again?

237
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,334
It's not coming
up in the system.

238
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,461
One second. What do you mean?

239
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,506
Am I good?

240
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,760
I'll tell you if you are not good.
Focus on your part, let me do mine.

241
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,889
I'm sorry, sir. I can't
let you leave with her.

242
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,808
Are you kidding me?

243
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,769
He erased me from
the fucking system?

244
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:11,979
I'm sorry.

245
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,400
It's not your fault.
Not your fault.

246
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,321
Sorry, Mary Jane.

247
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,578
- [grunts]
- [screams]

248
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,496
Shit.

249
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,165
What?

250
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,836
- What? Did you miss?
- Rosie, shut up. I need to concentrate.

251
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,087
They found you.

252
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,423
I gotta get you the
hell out of here. Now.

253
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,675
It's okay. It's okay.

254
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,179
You can trust me.
I tell you what.

255
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,598
Here, here, here. You drive.

256
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,142
You get me out of here, okay?

257
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,936
Whatever. But we gotta go. Now.

258
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,147
I'm one of the good guys.

259
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,152
- What happened? You missed her?
- Shut up. I think that's them.

260
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,946
That's them.

261
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,952
Get down! Shots fired.

262
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,758
Fuck!

263
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,683
Fuck!

264
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,497
[groans]

265
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,122
Ugh.

266
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,501
That's not just coffee.

267
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,752
[chuckles]

268
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,964
I thought we could use a little
something to take the edge off.

269
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,216
You headed back to the States?

270
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,511
[Brandon] No reason
to stay here.

271
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,890
Waiting around for Cusamano
to try and take me out.

272
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,226
That's a little
dramatic, Brandon.

273
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,897
Even if he is dirty, he
ain't worried about you.

274
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,233
He's too damn cocky for that.

275
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,777
So you do believe me.

276
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,364
- Doesn't matter what I believe.
- Of course it does.

277
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,782
You can take him down.

278
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,451
He'll slip up.
Let me follow him.

279
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,619
You're suspended.

280
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,248
Then you do it. I'll just be
there keeping you company.

281
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,126
- There's not a law against that.
- Actually, there is.

282
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:42,171
Then you go alone, or send someone
else, but don't just ignore this, sir.

283
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,133
Why are you pretending
I didn't see what I saw?

284
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,427
Because I don't care.

285
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,931
You think this is
a first for me?

286
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,436
I've seen more corruption
than I care to keep track of.

287
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,396
Guys getting off red-handed.

288
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,815
Eyewitness testimonies.

289
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,110
And they walk. No, check that.

290
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,029
They get promoted.

291
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,076
Cusamano's probably dirty...

292
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,371
and responsible for
deplorable things.

293
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,628
But I'm too old and too
tired to care, Brandon.

294
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:26,090
I'm tired of watching assholes
get off on another technicality.

295
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,302
I was like you.

296
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:31,846
Not as good a shot.

297
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,682
But I wanted to put on a cape

298
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,185
and put that big
S on my chest too.

299
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,315
Come talk to me in 40 years.

300
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,908
Well, I guess I'll see
you when I'm reinstated.

301
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,660
Hell, no. I'll be long gone.

302
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,372
I'll be hunting or skiing.

303
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:01,542
Or I'll be at the movies, big tub
of artificially buttered popcorn.

304
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,671
Sounds nice.

305
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,341
Enjoy your retirement, sir.

306
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,582
Whoa, whoa.

307
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,004
Oh, I got a bad feeling
about those long faces.

308
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,008
It wasn't Gildie's fault.

309
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,218
- There were...
- Fuck!

310
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,596
Do you have any...? No.

311
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:01,227
Do you have any clue the fucking
phone call I have to make now?

312
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:02,979
Do you?

313
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,189
Because of you two
fucking ass wipes?

314
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,399
Watch it, Dax.

315
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,109
We did everything we could.

316
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:09,944
Don't tell...

317
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,572
Don't tell me to watch it.

318
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,656
Don't fucking...

319
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,828
Fuck!

320
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,122
What's going on?

321
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,792
I'm guessing the brothers
weren't successful.

322
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:25,876
Fuck!

323
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:27,794
Fuck!

324
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,296
Fuck!

325
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,132
Guessing you're right.

326
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,220
Seem pretty happy about that.

327
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,389
No, it...

328
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:41,558
No, I...

329
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,155
Is she expecting us?

330
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,115
No, no. God, no.

331
00:26:56,199 --> 00:27:00,745
This is an "ask for forgiveness,
not permission" situation.

332
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:04,915
Why here?

333
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,168
'Cause no one will find us here.

334
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,172
Can lay low for two seconds,
figure out what our next move is.

335
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,553
- Is this gonna be awkward?
- Mm-hm.

336
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,847
How long have you been divorced?

337
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,682
Three years. Ancient history.

338
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,267
Sidney.

339
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:30,024
Zero, is that you?

340
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,444
Get over here, you sneaky
son of a bitch. Come on.

341
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,570
Ha, ha!

342
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,156
- Hey.
- Hey, Sidney Gorfein.

343
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,450
- Mary Jane.
- Glad to meet you, Mary Jane.

344
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:43,329
Anybody who's friends with this crazy
SOB is welcome in our home any time.

345
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,414
- You son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

346
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,250
- Let me look at you.
- Okay.

347
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,835
- This guy.
- Yeah.

348
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,213
- Always with the coolest goddamn jackets.
- Can we go inside?

349
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,297
Yeah, come on.

350
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,343
Hey!

351
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,637
Well, I was right.

352
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,055
It was Zero.

353
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,432
And a friend.

354
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,600
Hi.

355
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,104
What the hell are you
doing here, Ezekiel?

356
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,398
And who the hell is she?

357
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,401
Okay, so there are people
that are looking for her

358
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,610
that want her dead.

359
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,322
So you thought you'd just
pop over for Shabbat?

360
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,618
Well, we just need a place
to lay low for a bit, Shelly.

361
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,537
My apartment's the first
place they'll look.

362
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,248
And I can't trust law
enforcement at present.

363
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,126
Please.

364
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,729
- Can you help us out?
- [Sidney speaks indistinctly]

365
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,714
You're lucky I
made extra tonight.

366
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,759
We can accommodate you
and your new... friend.

367
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,177
[knocking on door]

368
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,596
And one more?

369
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,435
Hi, I'm Brandon.

370
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,020
I'm a friend of Zero's.

371
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,397
Oh, well, hey. Come on in.

372
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,857
Let me guess.

373
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,444
Homeland too, huh?

374
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:00,698
Duking it out with this SOB,
saving lives, cracking heads?

375
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:02,992
[Brandon] Uh...

376
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,075
No.

377
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,120
He's CIA.

378
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,458
Thank you, Zero. Not at
all classified information.

379
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:12,834
And, uh...

380
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:17,506
Actually, I was... I was
let go recently, so, uh...

381
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,132
Oh.

382
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:20,842
Yeah.

383
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,846
You'll find something.

384
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,145
So be honest.

385
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:33,981
Who's the better shot?

386
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,442
- Between me and Brandon?
- [Sidney] Uh-huh.

387
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,045
Sidney, you're eating with one
of the best snipers in the world.

388
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,490
I couldn't win a stuffed animal
at a carnival rifle game.

389
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:47,286
In his defense, neither can I.
Those things are definitely rigged.

390
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,456
You hear that, honey?

391
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,126
Best sniper in the world,
right here at our table.

392
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,837
Well, I'm not the best
sniper in the world.

393
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,217
And you're not so good, huh?

394
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,845
I have other skills, Sidney.

395
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,432
But, no, I'm not a great shot.

396
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:12,394
That's, uh...

397
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:14,772
It's disappointing.

398
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,950
[clears throat] Anyway, Zero,
can I talk to you for a second?

399
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,410
- Privately?
- Yeah.

400
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:32,957
Just...

401
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,917
Hey, super cool vest.

402
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,877
[Brandon] Thanks.

403
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:48,472
We can't stay here much longer,
regardless of how much Sidney wants us to.

404
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,683
All our resources
are compromised.

405
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,436
I'm suspended. Cusamano
erased you from the system.

406
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,147
All our government
resources are compromised.

407
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,190
What are you suggesting?

408
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,568
We go see our old friend.

409
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,779
So you do know where she is.

410
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,449
I thought we were friends.

411
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,660
[indistinct chatter]

412
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,746
[upbeat rock music playing]

413
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,599
Thanks, LD.

414
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,167
You go that way,
we'll go this way.

415
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,669
Ask around, but be smart. She
is not looking to be found.

416
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,964
We'll call each other if we get any
info. Let's keep digging until we do.

417
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:04,882
Sounds like a plan.

418
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,384
Wouldn't it be more efficient
to split three ways?

419
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,762
Yes, but you're already being
hunted by a gang of thugs

420
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,055
and a crooked federal agent.

421
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,890
I'd hate to add her to the list.

422
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,725
I've seen her kill
a lot of people.

423
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,479
Lovely. Can't wait to meet her.

424
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,564
[speaking indistinctly]

425
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,733
[upbeat rock music
playing over speakers]

426
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,623
[door chimes jingle]

427
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,683
Have you ever seen
this woman around here?

428
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,234
Hey, sorry to interrupt. Have you
ever seen this woman around here?

429
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,860
No?

430
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,783
Uh, have either of
you two ever seen...?

431
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,622
- Excuse me, man. Have you seen...?
- Follow me.

432
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,252
[pensive music playing]

433
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,056
So how do you know the
woman in the photo?

434
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Shut up.

435
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,853
You two friends or something?

436
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:41,936
Shut up.

437
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,615
- Why you in such a rush?
- Shut up.

438
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,581
Hey, who are you?
Where are we going?

439
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,333
Down there. We never met.

440
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,437
Hello?

441
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:34,865
Hello?

442
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,951
[tense music playing]

443
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,709
Nice to see you too.
Wait, I'm not here to...

444
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,093
Listen to me. I'm...

445
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,313
Just hold on.

446
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,525
I'm not trying to...

447
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,804
What is your problem?

448
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,160
- You done?
- [Zero] Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey.

449
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,954
Hey, hey, we're
all friends here.

450
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:08,083
[speaking in Japanese] Calm
down. We're all friends.

451
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,752
[in English] We need your help.

452
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,296
Help?

453
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,550
If you would've let me finish...

454
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,020
So this is Lady Death
off the grid, is it?

455
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,779
What do you want?
Thirty seconds.

456
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,114
There's a crooked federal
agent helping a sex trafficker

457
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,033
smuggle women into the country.

458
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,452
But he's watching
our every move, so...

459
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,454
We need you.

460
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,666
- No.
- What? That was like 11 seconds.

461
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,918
Don't make us beg you.

462
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,295
[Mary Jane] They told
me they found my family.

463
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,841
Spent my life in one
foster home after another,

464
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,551
thinking my parents were dead...

465
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:04,848
then one day these people find me and
say they're alive, living in the U.S.

466
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,684
They were nice.

467
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:11,855
Told me they'd take me to see them.
Told me they were excited to see me.

468
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,068
Told me I had a little brother.

469
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,070
Then the reality.

470
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,075
I spent seven days in a
pitch-black shipping container

471
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,702
with no food or water
and nine other girls.

472
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,416
I still wake up every night in a panic,
thinking I'm stuck in that metal cage.

473
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,128
From there, it just got worse.
Just full-blown sex slavery.

474
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,048
We're not allowed to leave,
not allowed to have phones,

475
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:41,844
or friends, or, like, lives
outside the compound in any way.

476
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,850
We were prisoners, stripping
on camera for fucking Bitcoin.

477
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,935
[pensive music playing]

478
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,855
They killed everyone but me.

479
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,691
I only escaped because one guy
had something like a heart.

480
00:37:56,692 --> 00:38:00,654
Now they want me dead because I can
identify every last one of them.

481
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,615
Including the guy that
double-crossed him.

482
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,705
They need your help, so that these animals
can't do it to another group of girls.

483
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,541
But me, I just...

484
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:17,880
I just wanna stay alive.

485
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:25,887
Okay.

486
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,349
- What's the plan?
- Oh, thank you.

487
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:31,018
Okay, okay. Um...

488
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,479
This guy who let you go...

489
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,147
- Simon.
- Simon.

490
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,607
How sweet on you is he?

491
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:40,277
He's a good guy.
Do whatever I ask.

492
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,196
Beautiful. We need
to bring him in.

493
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,698
He's getting ready to turn.
We need you to finish the job.

494
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,784
Get him to tell us everything: when
the next shipment of girls comes in,

495
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,037
where the new base of
operations is located,

496
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,371
the whole nine yards.

497
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:52,789
You still got that number?

498
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:55,709
Here.

499
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,670
We can't trust our phones,
even with encryption.

500
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,381
[Zero] Shit, you're right.

501
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,009
I know a guy.

502
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,596
Oh, this asshole?

503
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,517
- You know this guy?
- He set the trap for me earlier today.

504
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,268
Sorry about that.

505
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,230
Come on in.

506
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,068
[upbeat rock music playing]

507
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,040
We need your help.

508
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,543
Zeke Rosenberg. Call me Zero.

509
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,379
Intelligence Pete. Call me that.

511
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:47,052
Zero. Lady Death. Am I the only one
that uses their real goddamn name?

512

[Mary Jane scoffs]

513
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:53,934
I was a cam-girl.

514
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,520
Mary Jane is not my real name.

515
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,857
Brandon. Just
plain, old Brandon.

516
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,986
Nice to meet you.
What do you guys need?

517
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,154
Good work, Manny.

518
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,283
You can access all the
feeds right from a phone?

519
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,535
This is great.

520
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,745
- Dax will be pleased.
- Really?

521
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,292
I don't want to overstep anything.
I know you do things differently.

522
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,669
Well, this is better
than how I do it.

523
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,880
- Besides, you'll be running the show soon.
- Yeah.

524
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:25,757
Should do it your way.

525
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:32,055
Except for this
rat's nest of cables.

526
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,056
[chuckles]

527
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,058
How do you live like this?

528
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,602
- I do not know.
- Yeah.

529
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,895
That's it. I'm going
to get zip ties.

530
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,696

[Mary Jane] <i>Simon? Hello?</i>

532
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,003
<i>- Hello?</i>
- [Simon] Okay! I found them.

[ominous music playing]

534
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,382
We got some organizing to do.

535
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,216
Okay.

536
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,512
- Here.
- Hello?

537
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,558
- Lost him.
- All right, keep trying.

538
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,270
How we doing over here?

539
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,191
Boom, got it.

540
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:27,444
All right, Intelligence
Pete, earning that nickname.

541
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,654
You are good.

542
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:33,033
It's at a pretty low clearance level
but, hey, higher than you currently have.

543
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,117
Can you enhance?

544
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:35,702
Um...

545
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,412
That's not really a thing.

546
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,082
Why would he show you a
lower resolution on purpose?

547
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,459
Looks dead to me.

548
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,544
I assure you, she is not.

549
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:46,879
That's her?

550
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:52,469
That's the mousy, little nobody
that stuffed me in a metal box?

551
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,460
If she's not really dead, can
you please make that happen?

552
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:00,893
Yes.

553
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,857

00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,219
Oh, don't mind me.

557
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,388
Go ahead, get it.

558
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:39,808
Oh, it's a blocked number.
Probably just a solicitor.

559
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,392
Hate those.

560
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,354
Oh, don't run it yet. I'm gonna
make myself something to eat.

561
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,524
Sure. I'm just gonna
get back to work.

562
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,608
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

563
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,319
[glass shatters]

564
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,237
Oh, man.

565
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,534
- Hey hand me that broom, would you?
- Yeah, you got it.

566
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,829
- I could get it...
- No, it's my mess. I'll clean it up.

567
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,166
- You sure? I can grab a dustpan.
- I got it. I got it.

568
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:07,169
- I'm just gonna get back to work here.
- Yeah.

569
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,671
Actually, Simon...

570
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,592
I think some glass got
under the stove here.

571
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:16,011
Can I see the flashlight
on your phone?

572
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:20,015
I left mine outside.
It'll just take a second.

573
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,227
Thanks.

574
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,522
Where is the, uh...?

575
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,608
- It's just...
- No, no. I got it.

576
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:31,943
Those are your text messages.

577
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:35,363
Did you do an update on this
recently? I can't seem to...

578
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:38,784
I see your missed calls. That
blocked number is blowing you up.

579
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,160
But I can't...

580
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,077
Ah.

581
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,537
There it is.

582
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,581
[ominous music playing]

583
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,627
Oh, yeah, that is...

584
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,670
That is a lot of glass.

585
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,881
That's gonna take a while.

586
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,883
- [cell phone buzzing]
- Oh, hey, Simon.

587
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:56,634
Guess who.

588
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,429
That blocked number
again. You wanna get it?

589
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,056
No.

590
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,685
- It's just a solicitor.
- [Dax] Solicitor, right, yeah.

591
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,020
Relentless assholes.

592
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,982
But what if it's not? I mean,
what if that's an emergency?

593
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:15,320
They keep calling and you don't answer.
I mean, wouldn't you feel awful?

594
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,824
I really think you
should answer it.

595
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:19,908
[buzzing continues]

596
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,661
On speaker.

597
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:32,587
Hello?

598
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,924
<i>Simon? Oh, my God. You
answered. It's me, MJ.</i>

599
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,051
Hey, are you safe?

600
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,345
<i>Not until you get
here. Come to me.</i>

601
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:42,471
I will.

602
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:45,225
I can't talk right now. Um...

603
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,813
Text me the address where
you are. I'll leave tonight.

604
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,107
<i>Yes, please. I can't
wait to see you.</i>

605
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,776
Me too. I gotta go.

606
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,124
You can be there before breakfast
if you leave right away.

607
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,878
[Dax] Well,
congratulations, Simon.

608
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:15,881
You've managed to keep yourself
alive just a little longer.

609
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,843
Okay, we are going
on a field trip.

610
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,597
I don't want this to be an ambush, so
we're gonna do this from a distance.

611
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,891
Rosie, you stay here,
hold down the fort.

612
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,893
Raleigh, Gildie,
you're coming with me.

613
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:30,770
I am giving you a chance to
redeem yourself on this, okay?

614
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:34,107
You fuck this up again, your brother
will be Googling "funeral home."

615
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,360
- Easy on the threats there, Dax.
- You think I mean me?

616
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,572
Do I look like I'm in
charge? I answer to somebody.

617
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,783
That somebody just ordered the
execution of ten innocent women.

618
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:47,954
So, believe me, she will not think
twice about filleting you two dip shits.

619
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,043
Don't fuck up.

620
00:45:58,757 --> 00:45:59,758
Now what?

621
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,843
We wait.

622
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,891
Don't suppose you have
any beer in that fridge?

623
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,726
[Pete] Mm, no.

624
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,936
Orange pop.

625
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,812
Both Sunkist and Fanta.

626
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:15,982
I only drink Sunkist, but I
keep Fanta on hand for guests.

627
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,692
Not everyone likes Sunkist.

628
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,080
I'll have a Fanta.

629
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:34,917
Fanta.

630
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:38,421
Sunkist.

631
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,049
Fanta.

632
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,679
That's really
gonna clean me out.

633
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,639
Okay, I'll be back.

634
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,265
I can help.

635
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,480
[clicks tongue] So...

636
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,733
the elephant in the room.

637
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,320
You were supposed to be
shipped back to Japan.

638
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:05,240
- How'd you escape?
- Dude.

639
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,533
What?

640
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:07,701
It's okay.

641
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,161
I'll tell.

642
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,247
[whimsical music playing]

643
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,086
Like puzzles, I take it?

644
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:20,797
- What?
- Puzzles.

645
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,174
Oh, yeah.

646
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:26,928
I actually have a podcast,

647
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:29,973
and I'm developing an app
derived from the podcast.

648
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,476
<i>PEP Talk,</i> it's called.

649
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,686
<i>PEP Talk.</i>

650
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:38,565
Thanks. Yeah, PEP. Puzzle
Exchange Program me.

651
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,943
The podcast is
devoted to puzzling.

652
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:43,528
That is, jigsaw puzzling.

653
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:47,115
It's for jigsaw enthusiasts to
discuss all matters of puzzling.

654
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,284
Strategies, statistics,
and all the rest.

655
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,038
The app would be a way for
puzzlers to connect, chat,

656
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,790
and ultimately exchange
puzzles, per the name.

657
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,545
You log times, pictures.
Just all good fun, really.

658
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,628
Wow!

659
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:05,633
That is literally the greatest
story I've ever heard. [laughs]

660
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,105
Evening, sir. I was told
to bring this to you.

661
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,900
- Who's it from?
- The office of Harvey Cusamano.

662
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,442
Thank you.

663
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,040
Goddamn it.

664

[pensive music playing]

665
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:15,869
Hm...

666
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:18,414
What's in Utica, New York?

found dead in her home this morning.</i>

<i>Was the activist and philanthropist
secretly a sex-trafficking kingpin?</i>

669
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,812
<i>More on this bizarre
turn after this.</i>

670
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,171
[in Japanese] Thank you.

671
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,674
For your help, and
your hospitality.

672
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,635
We're in your debt.

673
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,690
[in Japanese] When
I was a little girl,

674
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,736
my parents died
in a car accident.

675
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,199
After spending two
years in an orphanage,

676
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,243
I was finally adopted...

677
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:43,832
only to discover that my new parents
weren't interested in raising a child.

678
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,463
They were grooming an assassin.

679
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:54,052
I was only ten years old.

680
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,351
They broke me and made
me their lethal servant.

681
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,546
[in English] I may
be in your debt,

682
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,567
but I'm not doing this for you.

683
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,114
[ominous music playing]

684
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,442
Hello, Harvey.

685
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,904
- You're probably wondering why...
- Ah.

686
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,572
First...

687
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,616
a toast.

688
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,451
To what?

689
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,539
Bad weather.

690
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,258
You must be used
to the rain by now.

691
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,177
You've been stationed in London
for quite some time, yes?

692
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,471
Hm, it's been a minute.

693
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,808
Been a few weeks for you though.

694
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,853
Now that you put yourself
on the Laura Lake case.

695
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:27,937
Almost three.

696
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,482
But I've spent a lot of
time in this city otherwise.

697
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,235
- You have? Why?
- Work, pleasure.

698
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,820
Truth is, I love it here.

699
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,281
I don't think I'm
going back this time.

700
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:39,449
Is that right?

701
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,035
You should see the
adorable house I'm in.

702
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:43,244
Countryside, quiet.

703
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:46,831
I don't lock my doors. I don't
even keep a gun in the house.

704
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:53,087
Okay, I keep a baseball
bat by the bed.

705
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,424
Guess I haven't completely shed
my American paranoia just yet.

706
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,385
You have something
to be paranoid about?

707
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,807
- It was a joke, colonel.
- Oh.

708
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,060
Maybe you're the one
causing the paranoia.

709
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,521
- This wine is fantastic.
- That's nice.

710
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,858
What can you tell me
about Utica, New York?

711
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:16,819
Home of the Utica
Comets. You a hockey fan?

712
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,703
- I am not.
- So that's not why you're asking.

713
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,698
No. Care to guess again?

714
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:24,035
Is it the two envelopes in
Laura Lake's evidence photos?

715
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,798
- Precisely.
- Yeah, that makes more sense.

716
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,831
- What can you tell me?
- She was sending someone in Utica mail.

717
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,417
- You know those photos pretty well.
- It's my case.

718
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:35,046
Better question is, why do
you know those photos so well?

719
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,256
- You have an answer?
- You question their validity.

720
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,425
- Bingo.
- You think Laura Lake faked her death?

721
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:42,220
- I think someone faked her death.
- Who would that be?

722
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,228
I'm retiring soon.

723
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,815
That'll get you
thinking about things.

724
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,612
You're not exactly a green banana
either. You ever think about your legacy?

725
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,114
Can't say that I have.

726
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:02,407
I'm not surprised.

727
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:05,034
Rosenberg. Zero.

728
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:08,162
Asked Brandon to spy on you.

729
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:12,166
That's the kind of respect and
loyalty you inspire in subordinates.

730
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,045
Zero had Beckett spy on me because he
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

731
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:17,839
and asked too many questions.

732
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:21,843
I'll tell you the
same thing [ told him.

733
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,762
Look the other way.

734
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,723
We all know how this ends.

735
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:33,771
So let's save everyone a lot of time
and energy, and just look the other way.

736
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,154
The first year I
was in the Corps,

737
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,615
I saw something I
wasn't supposed to see.

738
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:49,996
I was red-hot,
angry, idealistic.

739
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:57,086
And when I reported it, my CO...

740
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,256
said just that:

741
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,591
"Look the other way."

742
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:03,509
I like him.

743
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,180
For the last 38 years,

744
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:08,848
I have.

745
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,767
More times than
I'm proud to admit.

746
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:14,562
But these kids,

747
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,356
Brandon, Zero,

748
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,066
they give me hope.

749
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,611
They're not gonna
look the other way.

750
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,032
They're not gonna stop until
they nail your ass to the floor.

751
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:37,043
[pensive rock music playing]

752
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:43,883
I'll be interested
to see how that goes.

753
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,933
Better yet, I might stick around
long enough to do it myself.

754
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:56,145
The nice thing about retirement, Harvey,
is I don't have to look the other way.

755
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:57,730
I've got nothing to lose.

756
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:14,663
B.

757
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:17,624
B.

758
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,003
- B.
- [groans]

759
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:22,672
What?

760
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,841
Sorry I got you suspended.

761
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:31,973
Zero, there's no place I'd
rather be than right here.

762
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:38,396
Now, will you shut the fuck
up, so I can get some sleep?

763
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,213
You asked me to go
there and do it.

764
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:07,091
To watch him. I didn't
expect you to arrest the guy.

765
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,011
But I appreciate that, you know.

766
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:11,995
[Brandon] What
would you have done?

767
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,475
[groans] Morning.

768
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:19,604
LD just dropped a
bombshell on us.

769
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:21,355
She doesn't have any coffee.

770
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:22,897
It's tea.

771
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:27,111
You're in luck. Simon wants to meet
at the coffee shop down the street.

772
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,698
No. We can't risk having
you out in the open.

773
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,241
He's probably not alone.

774
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:34,035
Even if he stopped
working for those guys,

775
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:35,911
there's a good chance
they followed him here.

776
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,165
He's probably expecting
the same thing from me.

777
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,789
They know I took off with
you at the police station.

778
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,045
He'll assume I'm
walking him into a trap.

779
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,588
I need him to trust me.

780
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:47,757
She's right.

781
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,507
[grunts]

782
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:53,721
Okay, when does he want to meet?

783
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,849
Twenty minutes. Well, 19 now.

784
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,808
Okay.

785
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:03,147
[Dax] How's the sight line?

786
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,482
Looking good.

787
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:07,860
Simon, we're waiting on you.

788
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:09,445
- [cell phone buzzes]
- Oh!

789
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,113
I just got it.

790
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:13,324
She confirmed, 9 sharp.

791
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:16,035
I told her to get
a table outside.

792
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:18,578
Perfect.

793
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:22,291
Your job's done here,
Simon. Nice work.

794
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,750
[silenced gunshot]

795
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,213
Okay, here's the plan.

796
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,757
<i>Raleigh will be our
man on the ground.</i>

797
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,635
<i>The fed she's running with won't
recognize him, but Mary Jane will,</i>

798
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,428
<i>so, Raleigh, stay hidden.</i>

799
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,098
<i>The fed will be with her. We
can pretty much guarantee it.</i>

800
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,101
<i>So, Gildie, find him.
Take him out first.</i>

801
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,185
- [gunshot]
- [screams]

802
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,348
<i>Raleigh is there in case she tries to
run, but if Gildie does his job right...</i>

803
00:58:44,397 --> 00:58:45,397
[gunshot]

804
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,733
<i>Raleigh leaves without
ever being there.</i>

805
00:58:47,817 --> 00:58:49,819
[suspenseful rock music playing]

806
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,697
- Sound good?
- Yup.

807
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:54,406
Good.

808
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,576
Raleigh, go get some coffee.

809
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,207
Okay.

810
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,293
Here's the plan.

811
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,587
<i>LD will be our
woman on the ground.</i>

812
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,257
<i>No one knows who she is, so
she can watch you up close.</i>

813
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,801
<i>Let's hope Simon comes
alone and without a fight.</i>

814
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,469
<i>Brandon will be up
here with a rifle</i>

815
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,513
<i>and a perfect vantage
point of the coffee shop.</i>

816
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:21,308
<i>So if things go sideways,
you've got an ex-yakuza assassin</i>

817
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,728
<i>and the world's best
sniper watching your back.</i>

818
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,814
- All good?
- Where will you be?

819
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,399
Up here spotting Brandon.

820
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:32,236
If Simon shows up with company, Cusamano
will have his men looking for me.

821
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,322
That's why it's your job to
make sure Simon comes up here.

822
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,699
We'll take it from there.

823
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,830
Yuki, we're hoping
she won't need that.

824
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,045
Never mind.

825
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,131
[up-tempo rock music playing]

826
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,161
Anything?

827
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,248
Raleigh's in position.
Still no Mary Jane.

828
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,545
[suspenseful music playing]

829
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,273
[Zero] Simon's late.

830
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,489
You recognize that Terminator
reading <i>War and Peace</i> down there?

831
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,909
[Zero] No. Let's
keep an eye on him.

832
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,662
He doesn't look like
your average Tolstoy fan.

833
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,872
That's not very
open-minded of you.

834
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:13,629
Come on. Where is
this little prick?

835
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:17,800
Still no fed?

836
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:20,261
- [Gildie] Not yet.
- Give it another minute.

837
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,931
I want to take him out first. If
she does anything fishy, you shoot.

[suspenseful music continues]

839
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,360
I think LD has the same bad
feeling about this guy as we do.

840
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:19,820
She is not hiding it well.

841
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:24,116
He hasn't turned a
single page of that book.

842
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,577
Either he's a really
slow reader...

843
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,746
Or your politically
incorrect generalization

844
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,664
about Tolstoy fans is accurate.

Get her!

You fucking moron! I thought
you were our ace sniper.

854
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:30,349
Un-fucking-believable. I'll
take care of it myself.

855
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,518
You might as well throw
yourself off this roof.

856
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:34,937
You're toast, my friend! Toast!

857
