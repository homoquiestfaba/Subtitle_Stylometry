1
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,345
You see what I'm saying?

2
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,980
Yeah, it's pretty good.

3
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,315
Pretty good?

4
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,716
It's kind of slow.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,419
What's slow?
The flow's slow?

6
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,621
No, the beat...

7
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,390
Is slow.

8
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,592
It's minimal.
There's a difference.

9
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,260
It's not overpowering the rhyme.

10
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,229
All right,
it's supporting the rhyme.

11
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,566
That's what a good beat
is all about.

12
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,834
Well, I guess.

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,769
You feel me?

14
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,804
It's got no hook.

15
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,540
Get out of here with that no-hook shit.
This ain't pop.

16
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,642
It's music right here, boy.

17
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,644
It's boring.
Bor...

18
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,613
Go to your room.
You grounded.

19
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,681
For what?

20
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,282
Because you like terrible music.

21
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,550
You can't ground me for that.

22
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,586
I can't? So you
make the rules now?

23
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,087
Is that what I'm hearing?

24
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,557
Stop making them noises
with your mouth.

25
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,625
What is that?

26
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,127
Oh, ok, you know what?

27
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,697
I can't hear it, because
this sick-ass beat!

28
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,466
Unh! Whoo!

29
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,535
Tell me you can't dance to that.

30
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,370
<i>You</i> definitely
can't dance to this.

31
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,607
Double grounded. Keep
talking, and see what's up.

32
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,413
Seriously, go to your room.

33
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,202
All right, you're ungrounded.

34
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,336
Let's go out.

35
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,575
I think she put the wrong
flavor in my ice cream.

36
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,077
But do you like it?

37
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,746
Yeah.
So you win.

38
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,282
You got a whole new
flavor to like.

39
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,519
But if I go back
and I want it again,

40
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,689
the problem is I don't know
what the name of the flavor is.

41
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,158
Well, what did you
order this time?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,693
Vanilla.

43
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,196
Ok, so just say vanilla.

44
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,687
Come on. Tell me more
than just<i> "nichts."</i>

45
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,788
Ok...

46
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,128
This...

47
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,730
Is a special activity program

48
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,167
for teenagers
at the youth center.

49
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,036
They have football.

50
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,270
American football?

51
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,406
No. Soccer.

52
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,174
They have...

53
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,409
And you want me to go here?

54
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:13,078
You can learn German with me,

55
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,283
but you need to practice your
German with people your own age.

56
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,484
Why?

57
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,486
Because I said so.

58
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,056
Because you can make friends.

59
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,325
I don't need friends.

60
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,760
Everybody needs friends, Morris.

61
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,398
If you don't like it,
you can blame me.

62
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
I don't like it.

63
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,274
<i>Ja.</i>

64
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,050
Hey!

65
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,620
Nah, I'm good.

66
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,755
Ah, American.

67
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,496
Hey.

68
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,164
Kobe Bryant?

69
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,747
No.

70
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,557
Yeah.

71
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,893
Morris.

72
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:29,894
Morris. I'm Katrin.

73
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,364
How old are you?

74
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,267
15. How old are you?

75
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,570
15.

76
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,639
I don't think this is true.

77
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,475
14.

78
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,510
So where are you going,

79
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,612
14-year-old Morris
from America?

80
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,913
Oh, um...

81
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,882
Um...

82
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,917
I was going to see this castle.

83
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,419
Oh, really?

84
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,487
Yeah.

85
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,257
Why is that?

86
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,993
Because I go this way
to my house,

87
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,995
so we cannot walk together.

88
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,130
Oh.

89
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,032
So I'll see you another time.

90
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,434
Ok.

91
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,350
This, I believe.

92
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,335
Want me to do you next?

93
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,503
Hell, no.

94
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,905
You messed my hairline
up last time.

95
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:58,042
So you don't want to walk around
looking fly for these German girls?

96
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,015
Oh, I can't talk to you
about girls now?

97
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,517
Ain't no girls to talk about.

98
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,519
First you get
the hi-top fade.

99
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,053
Then you get the girl.

100
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,523
It's the first rule
of the game, son.

101
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,861
When I was out here playing

102
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,464
and, uh, y'all
were in the states,

103
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,933
your mom did not
trust German girls.

104
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,268
She could trust me,

105
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,204
but she could not trust
them German girls, man.

106
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,007
She always thought
they'd be after me. Heh.

107
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,308
Were they?
Hell, no.

108
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,378
Not even one.

109
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,582
Oh, you know what?

110
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,651
Stop for a second.

111
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,254
Here.

112
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,956
What's this?

113
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,025
That was in the box
your grandma sent.

114
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,928
Just a hot rapper from the Bronx

115
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,197
around '93 free styling.

116
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,431
Who?
Me.

117
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,468
That's funny?

118
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,470
My own blood laughing at me.

119
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,206
I should take it back.

120
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,473
You used to rap?

121
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,210
Man, don't sleep
on your old man, son.

122
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,946
I had sick flow
with this freestyle shit.

123
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,314
Probably still do.

124
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,382
How am I supposed to play this?

125
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,952
Gotta get you a boom box.

126
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,954
Walk around the square
bumping that,

127
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,889
blow these Germans' minds.

128
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,326
They still sell those?

129
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,328
I have no idea.

130
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,231
Maybe I'll find one in a museum.

131
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,118
Hey, uh, I like...

132
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,953
You see that boy?

133
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,029
<i>Ja.</i>

134
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,447
Ok.

135
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,203
Yo, Kobe Bryant!

136
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,042
No food here, Kobe,
so good-bye.

137
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:30,014
Hey. You know, there is
a party under the bridge.

138
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,349
A body?

139
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,583
A party.

140
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,218
Oh, a party.

141
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,486
You want to come?

142
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,255
Tonight?
Tomorrow.

143
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,291
I think you should come.

144
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,363
Are you gonna be there?

145
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,597
<i>Ja.</i>

146
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,867
Ok.

147
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,702
Cool. Give me your phone.

148
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,947
Ok.

149
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,049
"Inviting"?

150
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:16,454
Inviting? Like in
what sentence?

151
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:20,992
Like, "thank you
for inviting me."

152
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,333
Are you invited to something?

153
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,501
Maybe.

154
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,505
I get invited to things
all the time.

155
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,109
How come you don't invite me?

156
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,411
Because you're old.

157
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,246
I'm old?

158
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,916
How old do you think I am?

159
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,418
Mm, I don't know. 40?

160
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,154
40?
38.

161
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,391
Is this how you talk
to all the ladies?

162
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,194
37.

163
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,929
You are a genius, Morris,

164
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,464
but you're not very charming.

165
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,868
Man, forget charming.

166
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,603
I'm gangsta.

167
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,205
'Cause all the gangsters

168
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,341
drink hot chocolate
with one marshmallow?

169
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,511
One marshmallow
is a gangster move.

170
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,146
Ok.

171
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,420
Teach me how to be charming.

172
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,890
I can teach you
how to say, "charming."

173
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,992
Do you have a boyfriend?
Why?

174
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,862
You want to take an old
lady like me out on a date?

175
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,897
No.

176
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,898
Good,

177
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,967
'cause I have one, yes.

178
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,268
What's his name?

179
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,370
Lukas.

180
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,339
Is he cool?

181
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,141
He's really cool, yeah.

182
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,210
He's in New York, though.

183
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,079
Where in New York?

184
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,580
The west village.

185
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,382
Man, fuck the west village.

186
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,285
Language, please.

187
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,289
I miss him. Heh.

188
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,526
He's, uh,
learning English there,

189
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,196
like you're
learning German here.

190
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,464
Cool.

191
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,531
So...

192
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,987
Ehh.

193
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,191
Morris gentry.

194
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,169
Uh...

195
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,033
<i>Hallo.</i>

196
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,101
<i>Hallo.</i>

197
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,238
<i>Uberraschen?</i>

198
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,175
Surprise.

199
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,652
<i>Hallo!</i>

200
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,919
Mo.

201
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,654
You know what time it is?

202
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,389
No.

203
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,958
You have your phone?

204
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,959
Yeah.

205
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,494
So you have a clock.

206
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,495
It's 12:30 A.M.

207
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,563
Where you been?

208
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,433
Nowhere.

209
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,973
Morris, where have you been?

210
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:12,109
I went to a party.

211
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,278
You told me to make new friends.

212
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,981
Yeah, make some friends,
but let me know.

213
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,016
Leave me a note.

214
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,484
I'm sorry.

215
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,585
"Pop, going to a party."

216
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,988
Boom. Easy.
Five seconds.

217
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,191
That way, I don't have
to wait up all night

218
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,959
thinking about what kind of shit

219
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,061
could be happening
to you out there.

220
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,396
This ain't Richmond no more.

221
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,497
You get that, right?

222
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,266
Yeah, I get it,
every fucking day!

223
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:36,333
Hey!

224
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,436
All right, chill with that.

225
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,571
I'll chill, too.

226
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,375
Is that all?

227
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,579
You pee your pants?

228
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,603
Hey!

229
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,108
Hey!

230
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,345
Hey.

231
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,280
You're mad at me?

232
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,883
Come on.
It was for fun.

233
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,385
You were supposed
to shoot me back.

234
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,654
You know, I give you the gun,

235
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,590
and so you shoot me back.

236
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,192
It's like a water fight.

237
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,628
They don't have this in America?

238
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,129
They do.

239
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,967
Ok, so you don't
need to be mad at me.

240
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,503
Look, you and your friends
just like to fuck with me.

241
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,105
I get it.

242
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,407
Just a bunch
of German dickheads.

243
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,309
I'm not gonna sweat it.

244
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,413
"German dickheads."

245
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,083
I like this.

246
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,584
So we are friends?

247
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,621
We are not friends.

248
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,390
Yes, I will show you
that we are friends.

249
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,625
How?

250
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,626
I don't know.

251
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,094
What do you want?

252
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,599
Do you have a boom box?

253
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,334
I don't know what this is.

254
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:22,006
Something to play...

255
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,040
This?

256
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,508
Ah, yes.

257
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,643
Come in.

258
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,613
Sit down.

259
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,480
That's my dad.

260
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:07,584
No. Your dad
is a rapper?

261
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,954
No, not now,

262
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,724
but I guess he used to for fun.

263
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,031
Nah. Those are
not his rhymes.

264
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,900
That's biggie.

265
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,535
He's just...

266
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,104
He's just rapping
somebody else's shit.

267
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,584
Can you rap?

268
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,653
Can I rap?

269
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:45,656
Come on.
Quit sleeping on me.

270
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:48,225
I got sick flow, freestyle shit.

271
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,260
Know what I'm saying?

272
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,895
Not at all.

273
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,630
I'll show you sometime.

274
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,899
I don't really listen to rap.

275
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,501
Who do you listen to?

276
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:00,237
Like techno and electro swing.

277
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,041
I like to dance, you know?

278
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,980
I hear black people
are good dancers.

279
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,148
Is this true?

280
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,986
Well, I don't really dance.

281
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,222
You don't dance,

282
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,224
and you don't play basketball?

283
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,959
So none of the sayings are true.

284
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,166
Do you have a big dick?

285
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,934
What?

286
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,137
Is your dick big?

287
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,608
I don't know.

288
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,376
Like this?

289
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,410
Katrin!

290
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,485
<i>Hallo.</i>

291
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,640
I should go.
Don't worry about her.

292
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,675
No. I really should go.

293
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,932
Ahh!

294
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,239
What you doing up
early on a Saturday?

295
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,607
Just woke up.

296
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,908
I feel that.

297
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,910
What you want to do today?

298
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,178
It is beautiful outside.

299
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm going to the youth center.

300
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,514
What? For what?

301
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,350
Hang out with my friends.

302
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:30,020
Aw, friends?
Look at you.

303
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,556
Boy, you're making 'em
faster than I am.

304
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,225
Hanging out with friends.

305
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,426
Going to parties.

306
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,128
Slinging that
big ol' dick around.

307
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,364
I see how it is.

308
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,132
Why you gotta talk
about my dick, dad?

309
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,167
'Cause if that thing
gets any bigger,

310
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,370
I'm gonna start charging it rent.
That's why.

311
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,438
For real, though, what time
you going over there?

312
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,374
You wanna see a movie
or something first?

313
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,409
I'm going right after
I finish this.

314
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,244
Well, shit, man.
What am I supposed to do?

315
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,546
You wanna drive me?

316
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,088
Morris.

317
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,061
Well, one of the younger
kids found something

318
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,496
in the back woods
and brought it to me.

319
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,167
Marijuana.

320
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,469
So?

321
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,637
Is it yours?

322
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,339
No.

323
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,375
Did you give it to any
of the other kids?

324
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,711
Man, why don't you ask
the other kids?

325
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,513
Ok.

326
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,283
Asshole.

327
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,340
Hey.
Hey.

328
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,476
Yo, big Mac!

329
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,383
You have a talent?

330
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,021
He can rap,

331
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,156
freestyle shit.

332
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,624
Rapper?

333
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,601
Ok.

334
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,375
I'm not doing that talent show.

335
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,443
Why?

336
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,911
I don't want to.

337
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,180
Are you scared?
Nah.

338
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:14,084
I just don't have anything
to prove to these people.

339
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:16,086
German dickheads.

340
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,025
I would like to see you rap.

341
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,400
This'll be a good one.

342
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,943
<i>Weg.</i>

343
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,478
Are we done?

344
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,882
Why? You have
more important things to do?

345
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:21,485
I gotta practice.

346
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,158
No. There's
a talent show tomorrow.

347
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,360
And you're in it?

348
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,394
Doing what?

349
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,163
Hit it.

350
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,134
Stop.

351
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,641
Yeah.

352
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:46,877
Let's go.

353
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:49,279
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,881
Come on.

355
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,048
Yeah.

356
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,492
I can't do it right now.

357
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,397
It's ok.

358
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,004
Hey, don't forget to ask
your dad to sign these off.

359
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,272
Ok.

360
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,474
Thank you.

361
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,126
Uh-oh.

362
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,610
Ooh-ee!

363
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,178
See? I'm nimble with it.

364
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,314
Uh-huh.

365
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,648
Come on. What you got?

366
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,450
Man...

367
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,019
That ain't nothing.

368
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,622
Huh?

369
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:06,890
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

370
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,625
Mm.

371
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:09,993
Yeah!
Well, congratulations.

372
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,027
Uh-huh.

373
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,069
Yeah. Um, it's not over
till the fat lady sings, ok?

374
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,238
And let me just show you.

375
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,174
Not only am I nimble,
I am quick.

376
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,013
I'll get it.

377
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,381
Rematch.

378
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,150
Your dancing messed it up.

379
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,056
Hi, Morris.

380
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,057
Hello, Inka.

381
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,193
Uh, is your dad here?

382
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,995
Yeah. Um...

383
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,396
I gave him the forms.

384
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,530
That's ok. Um,

385
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:50,500
I need to talk about
something else.

386
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,501
Excuse me.

387
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,069
Hey.
Hi.

388
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,604
Hi.
Is something wrong?

389
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:59,976
I was wondering if we
could talk for a second?

390
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,984
Uh, go hang in your room, mo.

391
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,920
Good-bye.

392
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,303
<i>Ja.</i>

393
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,313
Oh.

394
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,517
<i>Ja.</i>

395
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,154
<i>Und, um...</i>

396
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,038
You read through his book?

397
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:09,512
He was telling me about a rap he
was gonna do at a talent show,

398
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,548
so I read it.

399
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,116
I'm sorry.

400
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,518
It's a... it's a part
of the curriculum

401
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,988
to bond with the student
and to...

402
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,890
Look out for warning signs

403
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:21,958
warning signs?

404
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,493
Warning signs about what?

405
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,196
Many things, like, uh,

406
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,965
misogyny and...
Or violence or...

407
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,334
Does mo seem violent to you?

408
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,338
No, but this should...

409
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,107
How 'bout this?

410
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:40,276
You worry about Mo's
German, and that's it.

411
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,912
I'll worry about
Mo's everything else.

412
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:44,647
Ok.
Ok?

413
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:45,648
How's his German?

414
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,183
Its good.
Good.

415
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,187
I'm gonna go then.
Thank you.

416
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,489
Wait a sec.

417
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,965
If you want me to keep signing
these so you can graduate...

418
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,236
I suggest...

419
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,037
You mind your own business.

420
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,340
Ok.

421
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,120
What'd she want?

422
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:27,390
"Fucking all the bitches
two at a time.

423
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,127
All you can take
for just 10.99."

424
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,397
How does that hook go?

425
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,000
Do it for me.

426
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,268
Why?

427
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,602
'Cause I said so.

428
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,142
Fucking all the bitches
two at a time.

429
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,311
All you can take
for just 10.99.

430
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,513
Mom's on the pipe,
and pop's on death row,

431
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,549
so who gives a shit if
I fuck all these hos?

432
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,218
You ever fuck bitches
two at a time?

433
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,420
I'm asking.

434
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:00,557
Have you ever fucked
bitches two at a time?

435
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,658
No.

436
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,059
What?
No.

437
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,530
Why are you mad?
You curse all the time.

438
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:10,567
I ain't mad at you for writing them
rhymes because they're explicit.

439
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,070
I'm mad at you for writing those
rhymes because they're bullshit.

440
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,272
That's the best you got?

441
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,141
I was just playing around.

442
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,643
Let snoop Dogg rap about
fucking bitches two at a time,

443
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,213
'cause he's done that shit, ok?

444
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:26,983
You need to be rap about what's really
goin' on with you. You feel me?

445
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,586
So I should rap about
getting yelled at by you?

446
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,254
Nobody want to hear that shit!

447
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,389
Oh, you think you know
what people want to hear?

448
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:37,894
Just like you think you know what
it's like to fuck two women at once?

449
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:40,396
You don't know shit.
And until you know shit,

450
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,399
you need to rap about
how you don't know shit,

451
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,601
because that is garbage.

452
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,302
At least my shit is original.

453
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,470
What you mean?

454
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,506
I listened to your tape.

455
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,974
That's the real bullshit.

456
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,509
You heard the tape?
Yeah,

457
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:54,477
and it's just you
rapping biggie's rhymes.

458
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,179
What?
Why do I wanna hear

459
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,480
a tape of you rapping "juicy"?

460
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,315
'Cause that's
a hot fucking song.

461
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,351
And I probably killed
my own shit on side two.

462
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,553
Hey, we are not done!

463
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,392
Why do I have to hear about you

464
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:12,362
being in a talent show
from some lady at my door?

465
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,297
This isn't even
for the talent show,

466
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,132
and it's not even finished yet.

467
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,234
Well, finish it
by writing some rhymes

468
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,236
from your brain
and not your dick.

469
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:23,106
You're 13 fucking years old!

470
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,114
Yo, Mc big Mac.

471
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,395
Ok.

472
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,184
Whoo!

473
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,468
All right, let me
get some claps, y'all.

474
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,452
All right, no claps. Ok.

475
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,238
I'm gonna kill you, Bastian!

476
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,640
Hey!

477
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:10,213
Thank you.
You're finished!

478
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,251
Hey! Hey!

479
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,989
Let me go!

480
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,290
Let me go!

481
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,528
What does that mean?

482
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,564
Speak English!

483
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,134
Hey!

484
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:33,169
I like your freestyle.

485
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,104
Thanks.

486
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:38,641
Mr. gangster, you want
to get out of here?

487
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:43,880
You're not doing a talent?

488
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,516
My talent is leaving.

489
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,621
Ok.

490
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:54,057
Ok.

491
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,261
Hell, nah.

492
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,166
Why do you live in Germany?

493
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:04,300
My dad works here.

494
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,169
He works for the soccer team.

495
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,104
He's a player?

496
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:10,873
No. He used to be a player,

497
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,575
but he's on the coaching staff.

498
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,410
Really?

499
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:18,014
But the team around here is
not very good, you know?

500
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:21,484
Well, I still think it pays
better than in America.

501
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,086
I don't know.

502
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,689
He played here,
so I guess he works here.

503
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,398
Was your mom mad
about me being over?

504
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,167
Probably.

505
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:41,037
I don't care.
My mom is a bitch.

506
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,979
Your mom's nice?

507
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:54,050
Yeah, she's nice.

508
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:55,251
Lucky.

509
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,553
Hey, wanna hear an impression?

510
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,423
What is an impression?

511
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,425
You know who Jay-Z is?

512
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,594
He is married to Beyoncé.

513
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,499
Yeah, it's ya boy.

514
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,601
Jay to the Izzo in the house.

515
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,136
Hova!

516
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,971
And this is like Jay-Z?

517
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,339
You don't know
what he sounds like?

518
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:18,007
Not really.

519
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,108
Damn.

520
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,644
That was
a badass impression, too.

521
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,246
You need to learn
some Jay-Z.

522
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,948
Here.
Give me earbuds.

523
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,052
No, for you.

524
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,354
Oh.

525
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,361
I like this.

526
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,632
Yeah?

527
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:28,044
Who was that guy you
left with the other day?

528
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:29,545
What?

529
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:30,980
The other day.

530
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:33,015
You left with someone on a bike.

531
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,016
Ah, per.

532
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,385
He's in university.

533
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:39,388
He asked me to a party
tomorrow night.

534
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,723
You want to go?

535
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,126
It will be fun.

536
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,028
My friend Nadine brings ecstasy.

537
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,666
You know?
We could all do it.

538
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:52,969
I don't know.

539
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,307
This is my stop.
Good-bye.

540
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,464
<i>Ja?</i>

541
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,678
<i>Ja.</i>

542
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,085
Mo!

543
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,592
Mo, you in here?

544
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:18,127
Got something for you.

545
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,262
Peace offering.

546
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:21,497
Mo, pull your...

547
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,532
Put your pants on.
I'm coming in, man.

548
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,136
Huh.

549
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,304
I wish you were here.

550
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,472
Shit's starting to get real.

551
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,668
<i>Hallo?</i>

552
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,174
Curt... ahem. Carlos.

553
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,376
Carlos? Mm.

554
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,451
America?

555
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:57,319
Do you want me to speak English?

556
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,055
No, no, no. I want
you to speak German.

557
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,323
Ok.

558
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,699
Um...

559
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,202
I'm not sure.

560
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:32,488
Uh, no, not really.

561
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,729
Ok.

562
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,167
I think I'm gonna bounce.

563
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:19,134
Bounce?

564
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,135
Leave.

565
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,904
Why?

566
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,939
I'm not feeling great.

567
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,074
I'm not ready to leave.

568
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:29,244
Well, I am.
I got a headache.

569
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,113
Let's dance.

570
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,115
Nah. Nah.
I don't want to. No.

571
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,183
Come on.

572
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,719
I don't dance.

573
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,622
No. No.

574
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,460
All right. All right.
Yes.

575
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,508
A few classmates were there.

576
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,276
It was good.

577
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,211
Cool.

578
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:45,047
The best part
of the party, though,

579
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,883
was when these two kids started dancing.
They were good.

580
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,952
They were, like, in the
middle of the room.

581
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:52,487
They were dancing like
no one was watching,

582
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,289
like this.

583
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:00,929
Have you ever seen anybody
dance like this, Morris?

584
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,265
Are you gonna fucking
snitch on me again?

585
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,633
What did I say?

586
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:05,701
Language.

587
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,377
Here.

588
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:25,253
I'm not gonna
snitch on you again.

589
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:28,323
Ok? I understand it's
none of my business.

590
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,195
But I wanna tell you something.

591
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:34,663
You are young.

592
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:36,999
Believe it or not,
you are young,

593
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:39,167
and there's no rush to be old.

594
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,369
Trust me.

595
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:43,071
Nobody dances like you
at these parties.

596
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:46,575
You know?
They all dance boring.

597
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:49,344
Now don't rush to be boring.

598
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,946
Be young.

599
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:53,348
Be you.

600
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,250
Ok.

601
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:57,919
You make a very cute couple.

602
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:59,221
We're not a couple.

603
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:02,324
'Cause you're single
and unattached?

604
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,192
I'm not a player.
I just crush a lot.

605
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,028
What?

606
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,997
Nothing.

607
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,367
Doctor, they're chasing us.

608
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:14,202
Hmm.

609
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:15,370
Hey.

610
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:16,938
Hey.

611
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:20,175
What you watching?

612
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,376
TV.

613
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,080
How was the movie last night?

614
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,616
Fine.

615
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:31,053
I was thinking maybe we
could go to one together.

616
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,722
I don't know if they, uh...

617
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:43,432
Hey. I don't know what's
going on with you, man,

618
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:45,600
but, um, we need to talk.

619
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:48,036
I know you got banned
from the youth center.

620
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,038
Why you out here
causing trouble?

621
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
I didn't do anything!

622
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,643
Those people were out for me!

623
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:57,012
I believe that could be true.

624
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,253
So believe it.

625
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:06,588
All right.

626
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,990
You're saying it
to my face, so I believe it.

627
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:12,027
But just know it won't take
much for some people out here

628
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,361
to give you some serious shit.

629
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:14,596
You understand what I'm saying?

630
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,531
So don't be out here
looking for it.

631
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,467
I'm not looking for it.

632
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,037
I gotta go out of town,
to Berlin.

633
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,306
I'll be gone overnight.

634
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,074
I know I told you
I wouldn't be traveling

635
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,343
until the season started,
but I have to go. I'm sorry.

636
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:31,213
But you been acting like a real
big man around here lately,

637
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:33,448
so I'm gonna treat you
like a big man, ok?

638
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,084
You think you can handle
being here by yourself?

639
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,121
Here by myself all day.

640
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,255
I'm serious.

641
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,390
I trust you.

642
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:44,192
Ok.

643
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,261
My man.

644
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,470
Psst!

645
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,377
Katrin.

646
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,445
Oh.

647
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,284
Hey.

648
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,319
Were you texting me?

649
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,121
Uh, no. Per.

650
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,957
Oh, because I lost
my phone at the party.

651
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,126
No. Per's Djing
in Frankfurt tonight.

652
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,194
Per's a DJ?

653
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,395
Yes.

654
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:22,063
What's his DJ name?

655
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,065
Per.

656
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,367
Well...

657
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:28,870
I was gonna see if you
wanted to chill tonight.

658
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:31,439
Uh, no. I have to go.

659
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:35,210
It's a big show,
opening for a U.K. Band.

660
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:39,214
But, uh, you can come
as well if you want.

661
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:41,082
Nah.

662
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:42,083
It's not far.

663
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,485
They play the show tonight,

664
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,053
and we come back tomorrow.

665
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:47,589
Nah. I can't just
leave town like that.

666
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,324
You will get in trouble?

667
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:53,395
No, it's just I don't
have a phone or any money.

668
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:56,331
Ah, I understand.

669
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,466
You are boring.

670
01:03:58,468 --> 01:03:59,901
Well, if I'm boring,

671
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:01,570
why do you even want me to come?

672
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:04,039
You are also funny.

673
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,240
Hey!

674
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,250
What did he say?

675
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:18,520
He said, "I play the
flute, and I'm stupid."

676
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:57,626
So I hear you're
wanted by the cops?

677
01:04:57,628 --> 01:04:59,427
Nah.

678
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:03,365
He's a gangster,
gangster rapper.

679
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,267
Oh, you rap?

680
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,568
No.
Yes.

681
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,104
No. Not for real.

682
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,244
I still need to see you rap.

683
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,060
What was that?

684
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:33,328
A surprise.

685
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,462
Ah, no. Mm-mmm.

686
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,431
Last time you had
a surprise for me,

687
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,199
I ended up with a wet dick.

688
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,173
Chuck Morris, it's me.

689
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:46,875
Tried the cell first,
but you didn't answer.

690
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,209
Hope everything is cool.

691
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:50,078
I'm bored in my hotel room,
and all they got

692
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,613
on the TV is
"fatal attraction," dubbed.

693
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,315
You probably don't even
know what that is.

694
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:54,916
You better not, actually.

695
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:58,586
Anyway, give me a call
so I don't worry. Peace!

696
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,476
What does that mean?

697
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,045
In five minutes,
you will go out and rap,

698
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:58,446
freestyle shit.

699
01:06:58,448 --> 01:06:59,481
What?!

700
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:00,648
Surprise.

701
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,417
Hell, nah!
I'm not going out there.

702
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:05,720
Why? You can finish
from the talent show.

703
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,623
Fuck that.
What?

704
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,031
Feel dizzy as shit.

705
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:21,069
I want to see you rap.

706
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,438
M to the motherfucking g.

707
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:03,278
All right, I'll do it.

708
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,046
Yes! I think
you go now!

709
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,147
Now?

710
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:47,182
Give it up! Give it up
for my man Morris!

711
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:49,951
Yeah!

712
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,089
My god!
Did you see that shit?

713
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:56,891
It was so great!

714
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,526
<i>So...</i>

715
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,317
Come here.

716
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:34,656
Oh, Morris.

717
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,061
You will be ok sleeping in
the other room with Franz?

718
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,065
Good night,
Mr. gangster.

719
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,000
Close the door, yeah?

720
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,574
Ooh.<i> Ja.</i>

721
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:00,882
Katrin.

722
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,350
Morris?

723
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:03,418
Hey.

724
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,920
Don't touch me!

725
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,532
Per!

726
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,061
I'm sorry.

727
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,597
He was nice to you.

728
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,893
So did they say if
they were coming back?

729
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,195
Mm, I don't know.

730
01:14:27,197 --> 01:14:29,464
I woke up, and they were gone.

731
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,265
You were in my bathtub.

732
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,605
So they might have
gone back to Heidelberg?

733
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:40,141
Heidelberg?

734
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,275
No, definitely not.

735
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:45,546
Um, they maybe
went to Stuttgart.

736
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,281
That's where they play tonight.

737
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,549
Stuttgart?

738
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:50,618
Yeah. You didn't get
the tour schedule?

739
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:57,091
What was your job
at the tour, anyway?

740
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,392
Just hanging.

741
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,598
Rock-'n'-roll.

742
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,018
Inka Meinart.

743
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,019
It's Morris.

744
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,220
Morris?

745
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,556
Your number came up unlisted.

746
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:04,091
Yeah.
I'm at a pay phone.

747
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:05,459
I'm in Frankfurt.

748
01:16:05,461 --> 01:16:07,295
In... you're in Frankfurt?

749
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:09,597
Look, I'm sorry to ask this,

750
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,433
but can you pick me up?

751
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:16,537
What happened? Are you ok?

752
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:18,272
Everything is straight, but, um,

753
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:21,409
I just got stranded here, and...

754
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:23,444
I just need a ride.

755
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:27,415
Ok. Uh, do you want me
to call your dad?

756
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,216
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

757
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:31,953
Um, I already called him.

758
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,154
He's in Berlin.

759
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,189
He asked me to call you.

760
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,124
Everything is cool.

761
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:38,893
I just need a ride.

762
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:43,197
Um, well, it's gonna take me
a while to get there.

763
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,201
So, just where are you?

764
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,737
I'm at...

765
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,873
Dornbusch.

766
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:53,941
All right. Stay there.

767
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,009
Ok.

768
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,546
Thanks.

769
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,100
Where's your cell phone?

770
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,671
It was stolen.

771
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,941
You get roughed up?

772
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:12,319
Last time I was
in Frankfurt was 2001.

773
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:15,056
You know, your mom
was studying in Munich,

774
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:18,592
and I was still in the Bronx,
but I flew out to visit her.

775
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,161
Cost me a fortune,

776
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:23,097
and I had never been
out the country before.

777
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:24,532
I didn't know any German.

778
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:26,534
I didn't know shit.

779
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:29,603
I didn't even know your
mom for three months,

780
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:31,272
so it was like...

781
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:34,442
It was a crazy thing to do.

782
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:36,610
But I wanted to surprise her.

783
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:39,213
You know, real baller move.

784
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,215
But when I got to the airport...

785
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:45,953
Heh... I couldn't
understand anything,

786
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:49,090
where to go, what the
signs said, nothing.

787
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:52,126
So this British couple
that was on my flight

788
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:54,662
told me how to get
to the university,

789
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:56,664
and they bought my bus pass.

790
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,400
I didn't even
ask them to do that.

791
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,402
But I get to the university,

792
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:04,371
and I find out
that she and her class

793
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,108
had all gone to Frankfurt
for the weekend.

794
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:10,144
Frankfurt? Where the
hell is Frankfurt?

795
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:15,416
Again, this nice couple
I met at the university

796
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,052
told me how to get to Frankfurt.

797
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:19,887
They said they
were going that way,

798
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:22,623
and they offered me a ride.

799
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,358
I didn't really trust 'em.

800
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,360
I didn't really trust
any Germans,

801
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,095
but they were straight up,

802
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,097
you know, took me to Frankfurt

803
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:33,334
and became two of my closest
friends to this day.

804
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:34,435
Britt and Saul.

805
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,504
You met 'em when you were six.

806
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:38,572
You probably don't remember.

807
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:43,577
Anyway, I wandered around
the streets of Frankfurt

808
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:46,914
for four full hours.

809
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:50,217
I mean, I'm dipping into
restaurants and bars,

810
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,585
hostels looking for her.

811
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:53,988
I finally saw her.

812
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:59,093
She was standing on the
corner, hailing a cab,

813
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:01,996
3:00 in the morning.

814
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:05,199
She stuck out
almost as much as I did,

815
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:09,537
but she was also the flyest
girl in that entire country,

816
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:11,572
I mean, knock you
on your knees fine.

817
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:12,640
You know what I'm saying?

818
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:18,345
Her mouth dropped
when she saw me.

819
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:21,048
Her jaw... daah...
To the ground, man.

820
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,651
I walked up to her.

821
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:25,286
I'll never forget this.

822
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:28,122
First thing she said
when she saw me,

823
01:20:28,124 --> 01:20:30,224
you know what she said?

824
01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:32,159
She said,

825
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:34,895
"please tell me
you not here for me."

826
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:36,964
And then she jumped on me.

827
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:38,966
She... she grabbed me.
She hugged me.

828
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:42,036
It was like a scene
from a movie, you know?

829
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:44,905
That's the end of a chick
flick right there.

830
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:47,107
We stayed the whole
weekend in Frankfurt,

831
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:50,177
and I never took my
flight back to New York.

832
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:57,184
Love will make you
do some stupid shit, mo,

833
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,954
and I'm not trying to keep you
from experiencing that shit.

834
01:20:59,956 --> 01:21:02,189
I'm not trying to keep you
from experiencing anything.

835
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,492
My job is to raise you
right, and it's hard, man,

836
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:08,929
especially if you not gonna
be on my team, you know?

837
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:12,299
I know I put you in the
fire by bringing us here,

838
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,569
and you might be still
mad at me about that,

839
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:19,006
but I make the best
decisions I can for you.

840
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:20,507
Period.

841
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:24,178
I was in Berlin interviewing
for a job with their team

842
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,579
to get us out of here.

843
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:27,081
I didn't want to tell you,

844
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,283
because who knows
if I'll get it or not.

845
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:31,051
But I'm trying, you know,

846
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,520
'cause it's hard
out here for me, too.

847
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:36,190
You gotta remember
we in the same boat.

848
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:38,259
So get on my team, man.

849
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,364
Tell me what's going on,

850
01:21:43,366 --> 01:21:45,432
and I'll be there for you.

851
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:51,005
We the only two
brothers in Heidelberg.

852
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,440
We gotta stick together.
Know what I'm saying?

853
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:58,178
How'd you know it was a girl?

854
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,515
It's always a girl, mo.

855
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,956
I do hate it here.

856
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,227
My man.

857
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:15,262
I know.

858
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,630
But check it.

859
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:19,466
I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

860
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:23,170
but one day, when you lighting
the hip-hop world on fire,

861
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:26,073
it'll be 'cause you have
a unique perspective.

862
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:29,310
And when you collecting
all your source awards,

863
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:31,078
you'll thank me.

864
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,346
Source awards?
Mm-hmm.

865
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:34,581
Is that as far as I get
in your dreams?

866
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,150
All right. All right.
You right.

867
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:37,618
Can I get a Grammy or something?

868
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,353
Nobel prize!
How 'bout that?

869
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:41,355
Thank me in that speech.

870
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,192
So I'm not in trouble?

871
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:46,393
Hah!

872
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:50,097
Oh, no, you grounded
like a motherfucker.

873
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:05,546
Mmm!

874
01:23:05,548 --> 01:23:07,514
That is delicious!

875
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:08,949
Right.

876
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:10,084
Marvelous!

877
01:23:10,086 --> 01:23:11,919
Someone's in a good mood today.

878
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:14,488
Yep.
Not grounded anymore.

879
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,590
Oh. You a free man?

880
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,058
What are you gonna do?

881
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,094
Whatever I want.

882
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:22,496
So you're not angry
at me anymore?

883
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:25,532
Nah.

884
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,101
Sweet.

885
01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:28,369
Don't trust you, though.

886
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:30,104
No?

887
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,307
Don't trust no German women.

888
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:34,942
I ain't German.

889
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:36,043
What?

890
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:37,277
I'm not German.

891
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,513
Do you even speak German?

892
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:45,619
Well, I guess then it's
a good time to tell you

893
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:48,022
I'm not gonna be
your tutor anymore.

894
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:49,056
Why?

895
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:50,958
Because I'm graduating.

896
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,228
So we... we can't pay you
or anything?

897
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,964
I don't know German
well enough to stop.

898
01:23:56,966 --> 01:23:58,665
Well, you can pay someone else,

899
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:04,471
but not me, 'cause I'm
moving to New York.

900
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:06,573
For your boyfriend?

901
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:08,375
And for me.

902
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,147
Damn.

903
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:16,150
Language, mister.

904
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:17,384
"Damn" isn't language.

905
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,453
You gonna miss me?

906
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:20,654
No, not a bit.

907
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:21,722
Little bit?

908
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,393
All right.

909
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,585
Dear Mr. gangster,

910
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,088
I am writing you
from Dusseldorf.

911
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,490
Per played a show here
last night,

912
01:24:56,492 --> 01:25:00,294
and we have a few more days
before we go to Hannover.

913
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:02,930
I'm very sorry
we left you in Frankfurt,

914
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:05,432
but I think this was
the best thing to do.

915
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,434
So maybe I'm not sorry.

916
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,170
But I'm sorry
I did not say good-bye,

917
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:13,640
because I'm not sure if I'll
becoming back to Heidelberg.

918
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:17,244
You made me see how everyone
there is just dickheads.

919
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:20,047
Per is talking
about moving to Berlin

920
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:23,183
and wants me to move in
with him. Isn't that great?

921
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:26,053
Anyway, I wish
you could write me back,

922
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:28,021
but I don't have an address,

923
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:31,425
so just think of me
sometimes, ok?

924
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:35,496
Oh, P.S.
I listened to some Jay-Z.

925
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:38,031
Pimps and ladies
brushing shoulders.

926
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:39,666
Cool song.

927
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:42,469
And your impression
was really good.

928
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:46,240
I'm happy I've met you,
Morris from America.

929
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:48,609
Enjoy the picture.

930
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:51,044
Love, Katrin.

931
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:02,556
That bunny-ear-giving
motherfucker.
