1
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,526
Poor Jacobson.

2
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:49,693
He took his stapler?
How pitiful is that?

3
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:52,932
Still, you got to hand it to him...
he wen! for it.

4
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,439
That was his big mistake.

5
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:56,441
Always stay in
the middle of the pack.

6
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,773
It's the frontrunners
who fall off the cliff.

7
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:02,007
At least Jacobson made it
up on the seventh floor.

8
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,583
It smells like cabbage on this floor.

9
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:06,687
That's the smell of dead dreams.

10
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:08,550
I go to the clubs at night
and people are like,

11
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,680
"Hey, who's wearing the coleslaw?"

12
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:15,018
Do you know how hard it is to get laid
when you smell like coleslaw?

13
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:18,031
NO! hard, but Still.

14
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:21,361
He had a pretty sweet office,
I wonder who's gonna get it?

15
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:23,800
You wonder who's gonna get his office?

16
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,532
Jesus, Josh, why don't
you show a little class?

17
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:28,039
The guy just got fired.

18
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,943
- I'm gonna get that office.
- You'd better, Tim.

19
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:39,048
You need that job. With that car
you're driving and that apartment?

20
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:40,052
You're overextended.

21
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,720
These opportunities
don't come along all the time.

22
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:46,316
Right now, the window's open
and if you hesitate, bam!

23
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,056
You're gonna be my assistant.
Assistant to an assistant.

24
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:53,560
You can't go lower.
It's a shitty job, Tim.

25
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:55,602
Do you think Julie's
gonna marry you then?

26
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:58,966
Don't mess this up.

27
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:04,401
- Good pep talk.
- All right. Go, team!

28
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:28,091
The whole reason we bought
the plant was to shut the factory,

29
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:30,597
shed the workforce
and sell the equipment.

30
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,934
But now, it's all contaminated
with low-level radiation.

31
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,001
- Nobody wants to touch it.
- Americans are so uptight

32
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,314
- about radiation.
- They are.

33
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:43,948
But the Russians are a little less
particular about this sort of thing.

34
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:46,108
I like it. Get two bids.
Drive up the price.

35
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:49,150
- OK, that makes sense.
- On a different note, you'll notice

36
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:52,953
that our colleague, Doug Jacobson,
has been relieved of his duties.

37
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:58,155
Mr. Jacobson led us right to the edge,
playing around in the currency markets.

38
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,028
As a consequence, tomorrow morning,

39
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:03,137
I want ten ideas to make up
for his mistakes.

40
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,975
- What are you doing?
- I have an idea.

41
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,735
An analyst...

42
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:16,749
- ...has an idea. OK, then.
- Nice knowing you, buddy.

43
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:19,717
Sixth floor, stepping up, Nice!

44
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:24,987
It's all right. it's dead.

45
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:29,086
It's manufactured by Mueller Armaments,
from Zurich, Switzerland.

46
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:32,160
It's a company that made
a fortune during World War I.

47
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,161
Now they're sitting on
a bunch of bombs

48
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,166
that even the worst armies
in the world don't want.

49
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,096
All right, so we
cannibalize the company...

50
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:39,831
,,,who's gonna buy the pieces?

51
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:42,533
Oh, no, we're not gonna
strip this one down.

52
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:50,547
Novelty lamps. Great idea.

53
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:53,620
We could literally make
hundreds of dollars. Hundreds.

54
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:58,419
- Who cares about lamps?
- Marlin Mueller does.

55
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,523
When Martin isn't busy running his
family’s business into the ground,

56
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,690
he's either yachting
or buying art for his castle.

57
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:10,235
The business is going under,
but his personal fortune is vast.

58
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,066
Nearly half a billion.

59
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:17,041
I heard he was in town, so I sent
a prototype over to his hotel.

60
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:22,374
He loved the lamps.
He wants to sit down.

61
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,714
The lamps are really just a way
to get our foot in the door.

62
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,048
We're gonna lose money on them.

63
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:30,590
But we'll make millions
managing his personal portfolio.

64
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:34,593
Mueller keeps his business.
We've got a brand-new client.

65
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:39,257
- Everybody wins.
- Everybody wins. That's a new one.

66
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:41,163
- Caldwell, you want to take the lead?
- Absolutely.

67
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,491
I'll ride shotgun.

68
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,434
Actually, I was hoping
I could take the lead.

69
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,072
Let me think... no.

70
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,080
You should've quit
while you were ahead, buddy.

71
00:08:01,677 --> 00:08:04,681
You know what they say...
tallest tree gets chopped down first.

72
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:07,852
- Well, that went well.
- Mr. Conrad?

73
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,289
Have you got a second?

74
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,270
Come in!

75
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:25,536
You can just set
your bombs by the door.

76
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:31,714
You put on quite a show
in there. Sit down,

77
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,292
Oh, that looks good on him, right?

78
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:43,563
Yep. Better than it did on Jacobson.
You're gonna need a nicer watch.

79
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:45,962
Nicer watch, nicer suit.

80
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,625
Hey, to the ballsiest guy
on the sixth floor.

81
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,635
Not gonna be on
the sixth floor for long.

82
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,805
Does that mean
this is my new office?

83
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:58,207
Not yet. No, I want to
get to know you a little better.

84
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:01,208
I host a dinner once a month.

85
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:04,245
- Next one's on Saturday.
- Great, OK.

86
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:07,247
And it's top secret.
You can't tell anyone.

87
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:10,323
What are we talking about here? Orgy?

88
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,757
Is it a human sacrifice of some kind?

89
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:16,691
We're... collectors.

90
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,098
I'll let the guys fill you in.

91
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:25,361
Some people collect
vintage automobiles.

92
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:29,340
Some people collect fine wines.
Fender collects people.

93
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,837
- People?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,948
Each of us Ends a remarkable person
and invites them to dinner at Fender's.

95
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:37,381
We call it the Dinner for Winners.

96
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,679
Here's the guy that I invited last year.

97
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,688
There you go. Look at that.

98
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:46,883
The guy designed that suit.
Real-life Iron Man.

99
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:52,365
- He took first prize.
- He's an idiot.

100
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,065
You got it.

101
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,064
You invite idiots to dinner
and make fun of them?

102
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:03,141
That's,,. messed up.

103
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:05,267
- I know, right?
- It's completely messed up.

104
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:08,639
Al the end of the night, Fender picks
the best one, gives him a trophy

105
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,876
and we release him out
in the wild, none the wiser.

106
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:14,420
Yeah. No harm, no foul.
Hey, you're gonna do great.

107
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:17,217
Just have a little subtlety
when you pick your guy.

108
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:18,758
Fender's a connoisseur.

109
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,384
Yeah. Hey, and no mimes.
It's a cliché.

110
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,219
Jacobson brought a mime.

111
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,799
Exactly. And you don't see
his shit here, anymore, do you?

112
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,155
- Hey-
- Hey!

113
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,282
Congratulations.

114
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:54,951
So how did it go?
What happened today?

115
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,257
Oh, I'll tell you later.
Look at this crowd!

116
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:00,696
I know, it's amazing.
We actually sold every painting.

117
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:02,928
That's incredible! Oh, my God!

118
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:06,972
Except that I did another one
of my name-fiasco thingies,

119
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:08,939
Oh, God, What happened?

120
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:11,510
The director of
San Francisco MoMA is here.

121
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:14,376
His name is Steve Doche.

122
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:18,212
And I thought that it
was pronounced "Douche."

123
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,446
God. It's like the Ron Fuchs
episode all over again.

124
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,523
Well, it actually kind of
loosened things up, and...

125
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:29,153
...and he's giving Kieran a solo show,
and he wants me to curate it.

126
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:31,128
Oh, my God!

127
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,463
You know, that is so like you!
You call a guy a douche

128
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:36,298
and get your first
museum show out of it.

129
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,802
You're amazing.
I love you so much.

130
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,738
You're stunning and you're smart and
you're just awful with pronunciation.

131
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:45,675
- Hey!
- I'm not Fuching around here.

132
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:48,012
Marry me.

133
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:52,247
I love you.

134
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:55,014
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

135
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,490
But remember when
you asked me before,

136
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:03,422
and I said this is a big step, and maybe
we should just wait a little bit?

137
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:04,929
Yeah?

138
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:08,831
- That was two days ago.
- I know. I know.

139
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:11,200
I just need a little bit of time.

140
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:13,329
All right. I'll ask you in two hours.

141
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,270
Let's go.

142
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,404
Wow, it's packed.

143
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,378
So, where's the artiste?

144
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,507
I always try and create
some tension in my work.

145
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:27,520
Once a reviewer said
of a certain piece of mine,

146
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,351
may said, "i mink mars disgusting."

147
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:32,515
I said, "Good! I want it
to disgust you."

148
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:36,458
Sometimes I'll be working on a piece
and I'll think, "No, this is bullshit."

149
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:41,461
So I will literally rub bull excrement
on the piece as a meta... metaphor.

150
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,862
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

151
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:46,028
Julie.

152
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,779
Kieran, you remember Tim?

153
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,407
- The stockbroker.
- No. No.

154
00:12:56,538 --> 00:13:01,146
I work for a private equity firm
that specializes in distressed assets.

155
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:05,987
- So kind of a stockbroker.
- Almost nothing like a stockbroker.

156
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,152
Do you mind if I just
call you stockbroker?

157
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:11,231
It's the way I remember people.
You're stockbroker Tim.

158
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:15,064
Hey, so what do you think?

159
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,571
Really... tremendous work.

160
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:21,640
They're so big.
And you're in all of them.

161
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:23,936
Come with me, Tim.

162
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,137
Enjoy.

163
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:29,076
I have a little ranch... I say little.

164
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:30,980
It's absolutely massive
if you actually measure,

165
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:35,612
outside of town, where I go to
disappear, get away from this bullshit.

166
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:38,918
One of my zebras was in labor.
It was a messy business.

167
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:41,994
The foal was in breech.
At about the 22nd hour,

168
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:43,425
I just said, "Stuff it."

169
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:47,658
And I just thrust my hand in,
turned the little guy around.

170
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,268
Do you have any idea what it's like

171
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:54,932
to be up to your elbow...
in a zebra's vagina?

172
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:59,102
And feel life? New life, fresh life.

173
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:04,609
- No, I don't.
- You should try it, Tim. It's magical.

174
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,044
Yeah, I'm OK.

175
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:09,679
She let me keep the afterbirth
to create this piece.

176
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:13,954
Oh, wow, that's disgusting.
I don't think I get it, Kieran.

177
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:17,553
Poppycock. You've been
stockbroking too long, Tim.

178
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,894
What does it make you think of?

179
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:26,238
I guess it kind of makes me...

180
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,406
...think of your penis.

181
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:30,839
Then you get it.

182
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:34,513
Julie gets it.

183
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,212
Hi, I need you to talk to a buyer.
This way.

184
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:41,910
See you in a bit.

185
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:49,821
Do you know what its like to have
your entire head inside its anus?

186
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:52,689
Julie? Poppycock.

187
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:58,271
OK, so you're just completely
immune to his animal magnetism?

188
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:01,500
He looks good in a pair
of hooves. What can I say?

189
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,411
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened today?

190
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,109
I think I might've
gotten that promotion.

191
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:10,342
Really? Oh, my God, that's amazing.

192
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,179
- Well...
- When? When do you start?

193
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,048
All right, well, it's not
official yet. It's not official.

194
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:17,180
- There's this dinner.
- Good. When is it?

195
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,260
- it's Saturday.
- OK. We can do that.

196
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:23,420
No, it's not really
a girlfriend type thing.

197
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:25,293
It's really the guys from the office.

198
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:28,630
- And we have to bring a person.
- What do you mean, "a person?"

199
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:33,706
A person with a skill
or a talent of some kind.

200
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,566
Are you talking about strippers,
here? 'Cause I'm not...

201
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,700
No, no. Nothing like that. No.

202
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:43,744
We have to bring an idiot
to dinner to make fun of them.

203
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,388
- OK, that is messed up.
- I know,

204
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,222
- I know.
- So you told them you're not going.

205
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,725
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.

206
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:59,732
Tell Fender I can't make the dinner.
Tell him my back thing is acting up,

207
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,731
and I have to stay
in bed for a few days.

208
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:04,401
Why don't I just tell him
you're having your period?

209
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,733
Um, I can't stay
on this floor anymore.

210
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:09,736
These people are pathetic!

211
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:11,738
Happy birthday, Carol.

212
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,637
Why can? you just suck it up,

213
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:17,416
make fun of some idiots and stop
thinking about yourself for once?

214
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,575
Susana, I know this
is painful for you,

215
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,586
but sometimes in life
you have to do the right thing.

216
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:25,919
Just lie. l!'s not that hard.
I'm texting a lie right now!

217
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:33,699
Jesus Christ!

218
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:37,262
Are you OK?

219
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah, I'm OK.

220
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,669
- Is that a Porsche?
- Yeah.

221
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,543
I have been hit by a Datsun before.

222
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,012
- Never a Porsche.
- Oh, man...

223
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:52,710
- Barry Speck.
- Tim Conrad.

224
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:56,379
Are you sure you're OK?
I didn't see you. What were you doing?

225
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,789
Well, I saw this little guy in
the street, I was trying to save him.

226
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:04,053
- I think it's dead.
- Yes, that's why he couldn't run away.

227
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:05,665
A couple more seconds,
you would've squished him.

228
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:07,164
Nice pelt, though.

229
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,361
Ready?

230
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,533
I hope those aren't for your lawyer.

231
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:16,674
No. I would rather
not have lawyers get involved.

232
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,838
All right, I get it.
You said you were fine, but...

233
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,416
What would it take
to keep the lawyers out?

234
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:28,313
Five.

235
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,254
Five dollars.

236
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,182
I don't... What do you mean?

237
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:37,490
- Ten dollars.
- Seriously, what? Come on.

238
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:39,030
How much do you want?

239
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,762
- Hundred dollars.
- I don't want anything.

240
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:46,168
- Five hundred dollars.
- I don'!... It's OK.

241
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,172
- All right...
- As long as you're OK, then...

242
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:52,208
Ten thousand!

243
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,345
OK, I'll take ten thousand dollars.

244
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,512
I don't have ten thousand dollars.

245
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:07,418
You know what? Don't worry about it.

246
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:12,627
- Really?
- Yeah. As long as you're OK.

247
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,859
- You're a good person.
- No... It's all right.

248
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:17,699
- Get out of the road!
- You are. You're a good person.

249
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,361
- Thank you.
- No, you really are.

250
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:22,135
- You're a really nice person.
- All right, well, as long as you're OK,

251
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:23,436
- that's OK.
- Thanks. Thank you.

252
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:26,478
Yeah. You take care.

253
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:29,542
I won't forget this.

254
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:33,152
- You dropped your...
- Oh, yeah. That's my latest series.

255
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:37,280
I know. Mouseterpieces. Get it?

256
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:41,157
- That's the Mona Lisa.
- That's the Mouse-a-Lisa.

257
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,658
- Mouse-a-Lisa...
- There they are.

258
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:50,065
Found her on the 405. From here down,
she was a mess, but the head, perfect.

259
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:53,803
Oh, that's Cubism,
Not as easy as it looks.

260
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,408
Well, it doesn't look easy.

261
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:59,139
I like her. I love the tail.

262
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,981
- Check that out. You like them?
- I'm speechless.

263
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,078
So is he.

264
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:10,417
'Cause he's screaming.

265
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:14,517
I was just stopping by the store today
to get some pelt wax and spine wire.

266
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,687
Wanted to ill the guys in
on what I've been up to,

267
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:20,857
Hey, you know what? I have some
in the flesh. Want to see 'em?

268
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:23,970
Where did they...?
Come here! Come here!

269
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:28,973
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't look!

270
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:33,438
- OK... All right...
- Can I look?

271
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:35,446
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

272
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:38,478
Go ahead.

273
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:44,783
Incredible.

274
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,295
Does that guy look sort of familiar?

275
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:52,997
I'll give you a hint.
He wrote the Bible.

276
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:55,630
- ls it Jesus?
- Yes!

277
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:57,965
- You know your stuff!
- Amazing.

278
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:01,797
Yeah. Well, it's a hobby.
I like to think that...

279
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:04,571
...I'm sort of giving them
a second chance, you know?

280
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,308
In the words of John Lennon, "You
may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not."

281
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,521
- "The only one."
- The only what?

282
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:18,352
No, that's the lyric. "You may say I'm
a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."

283
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,489
OK, Tim.

284
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,999
You know, Barry, this was
a very strange way to meet,

285
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:28,665
but I think everything
happens for a reason.

286
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:29,994
Did you make that up?

287
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:31,831
Yeah.

288
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:36,899
"Everything happens
for a reason." I like that.

289
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:40,702
Thanks. Anyway, tomorrow night,
I'm having dinner with some friends.

290
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:44,841
Are you? That's incredible.
Congratulations.

291
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,420
I was wondering,
would you like to join us?

292
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:49,447
- You shitting me?
- No.

293
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,253
Say that your girlfriend
thinks meat is murder,

294
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,361
and she convinces
you to become a vegetarian.

295
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,523
Then one day, you're grilling up
a veggie burger, and all of a sudden,

296
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:03,467
a chicken comes up, plucks itself,
covers itself in barbecue sauce

297
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:05,037
and flings itself on the grill.

298
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,964
That's God sending a message, right?

299
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,741
Yeah, that chicken wants to die.

300
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:13,711
No. God wants us
to move to the seventh floor.

301
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,941
And He sent His only son to tell me.

302
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:20,385
Come with me, my children,
to the seventh floor,

303
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:28,717
Tim! I'd like you to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Mueller

304
00:21:29,818 --> 00:21:32,059
Of course! What a pleasure
it is to meet you.

305
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:34,594
Mr. Conrad!
You sent the lamp to my hotel.

306
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:36,498
- That's... yeah!
- I wished to meet you in person.

307
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,004
Yes, Tim was really helpful when
we came up with the idea for the lamps.

308
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,074
And we'd been discussing
personal investment as well.

309
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:45,139
That's a conversation I'm very much
looking forward to getting back to.

310
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,247
- Well, I'm glad we could do this.
- Yeah.

311
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:52,944
Congratulations on your
new Matisse. It's beautiful.

312
00:21:54,676 --> 00:21:58,089
My wife is a true collector.
It was quite a bidding war.

313
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:01,019
Well, to the victor go the spoils.

314
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,920
You know my family crest.

315
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:06,031
Our motto continues to inspire.

316
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:10,097
- Ad Victorem Spolias.
- Fantastic.

317
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:14,132
- Well, shall we?
- Yeah.

318
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,008
Join us.

319
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:26,482
So you follow the art world,
Mr. Conrad?

320
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:30,715
I try to. My girlfriend runs
The Cronin Gallery downtown.

321
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:34,123
I would love to meet her.
We must have brunch tomorrow.

322
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:37,555
They can speak about beauty.
We can speak about business.

323
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:39,560
Sounds perfect.

324
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:42,134
I'll have my assistant
make the arrangements.

325
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:54,037
OK, what the hell just happened?
This guys supposed to be my client.

326
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,979
- You're still just an analyst...
- No, no, this is better.

327
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:59,052
I didn't know it was
going to be a double date.

328
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:02,321
Tim's the only one here who
isn't divorced or dating a hooker.

329
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:09,523
This guy wants to invest $100 million.
Don't mess it up. We need this.

330
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:14,324
Well, the sixth floor steps up.

331
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,525
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

332
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:20,834
Hey, rooting for you, buddy, Good luck.

333
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:26,172
- My girlfriend's not a hooker.
- She tried to give me a BJ.

334
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:28,905
If she didn't ask for money,
then she's not a hooker, is she?

335
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:32,678
She asked me for money.
It wasn't that expensive, either.

336
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:35,788
I still had a ton of singles left over
from your sister's birthday party.

337
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:38,118
Hey, is Cinnamon a family name?

338
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,428
- Hey, honey.
- Hey!

339
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:50,024
Glad you're still here. Look,
don't make plans tomorrow morning.

340
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,536
Why?

341
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:56,535
How'd you like to have brunch
with a fascinating Swiss couple?

342
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:58,700
- OK.
- She's an art collector

343
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:00,244
and he's got a lot of money.

344
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:03,872
- I need you. This is huge.
- it's huge?

345
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:06,719
- Really huge.
- What's this?

346
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:13,056
What is this?

347
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:17,221
That's a...

348
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:19,793
It's a mouse dressed like Jesus.

349
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:23,463
This guy that I ran into today,
he makes them.

350
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:27,061
He's amazing.
He's some kind of artisan.

351
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:30,632
Really? Are you doing that dinner?

352
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,233
No.

353
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,742
- Hey, come on.
- No, not when you're lying to me.

354
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:41,680
- Julie, Fender invited me.
- So?

355
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,848
Fender, as in Fender Financial?

356
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,586
The you I know
would have just said no.

357
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,525
The me that you know did say no.

358
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:53,030
But the me that you don't know
had to say yes.

359
00:24:53,154 --> 00:24:55,259
- The you I don't know?
- Yes.

360
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,695
Look, there's you
and the me that you know.

361
00:24:57,826 --> 00:25:00,534
And we love each other
and we have a wonderful life.

362
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,608
But then there's the me
that you don't know.

363
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:06,211
And the me that you don't know
has to do things sometimes so that you

364
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:09,037
and the me that you know
can live in this nice apartment,

365
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,878
and eat at nice restaurants
and go to Cabo for Christmas.

366
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:13,884
- He takes care of us.
- You know what?

367
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:16,114
There should not be
any you I don't know.

368
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:18,282
But there is.
You might not like him.

369
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,951
I don't like him.
I hate him! But we need him.

370
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,962
- You know? It's like the CIA.
- The CIA?

371
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,157
The CIA does some pretty funky,
nasty stuff in the shadows,

372
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:28,961
but I, for one, am glad they're there.

373
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,196
The CIA doesn't invite people to dinner

374
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:35,365
- to make fun of them.
- No. The CIA kills people.

375
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,376
And I'm getting raked over the coals
because of a little dinner.

376
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,911
Can I just ask you something?

377
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:43,744
Is there any you I don't know
who isn't completely full of shit?

378
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:47,012
I'd love to talk to him right now.

379
00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:49,913
Julie, come on. Julie!

380
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:55,326
Julie! Julie, where are you going?

381
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,187
I... I have to go meet Kieran
and talk about San Francisco.

382
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,198
Julie, please come out of the elevator.
All right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:03,165
I'll call him,
I'll tell him the dinner's off.

384
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:06,102
- I want to believe you.
- You can believe me.

385
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:07,831
I'll never see that guy in my life.

386
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:10,102
- Yeah.
- I promise.

387
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,673
Oh, my,,, Let's talk later.

388
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:14,836
- In a few hours.
- What?

389
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:15,937
I think we need to cool off.

390
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,381
- Gosh, I hate when that happens.
- We'll talk in a bit, OK?

391
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:20,884
- Just give ourselves a moment...
- I gotta go to work.

392
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:22,784
I feel like I'm in The Shining.

393
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,218
You are welcome.

394
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,263
Oh, God. My back, my back, my back.

395
00:26:32,387 --> 00:26:34,196
Is it your back?

396
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:35,961
What the hell are you doing here?

397
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:37,365
Well, I went to the address you gave me.

398
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:41,029
Nobody was there.
Are we having this dinner or not?

399
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:44,973
OK, just... slow.

400
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,605
Au right.

401
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:54,317
- What are you doing?
- I'm applying heat.

402
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,717
Barry, please stop doing that.

403
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:03,218
- I'm gonna ix your back.
- Barry, stop!

404
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:04,319
I am a trained taxidermist.

405
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:07,895
- And I am alive.
- You are tight.

406
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:10,630
- Oh, God!
- OK...

407
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:12,304
Look at that face!

408
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:14,834
- Stop it!
- OK, all right.

409
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:19,970
- I hope this doesn't mess up dinner.
- We're not having dinner tonight.

410
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,911
- it's tomorrow,
- I don'! think so, Tim.

411
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,609
Barry, I made the plans.
I know when it is.

412
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:30,249
- I'm pretty sure it's tonight.
- it's not tonight.

413
00:27:30,345 --> 00:27:33,758
OK. All right.
I guess one of us got confused.

414
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:40,964
Great. She left her phone here.

415
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:44,466
You know what they say,
everything happens for a reason.

416
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:46,663
YOU Said That.

417
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:49,304
You know what, Barry?

418
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,707
I am really, really looking forward
to our dinner tomorrow night.

419
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:56,976
But, right now,
I'd appreciate it if you just left.

420
00:27:57,105 --> 00:28:01,281
And the reason is...'?

421
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:02,887
Because I got
in a right with my girlfriend,

422
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:07,050
and because I'd like to be here
alone when she comes back, OK?

423
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:11,830
- What if she doesn't come back?
- She's coming back.

424
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:17,999
Hey, we are gonna
get through this together.

425
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:21,073
I think I know someone
who might make you feel better.

426
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:28,409
Remember this guy
from the street? This is you.

427
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,744
Barry, that was a dead mouse
in the road

428
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,978
a couple of hours ago.
Please get it away from my face.

429
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:37,385
It's like looking in a mirror, isn't it?
You feel better?

430
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,822
- it's amazing.
- Are you cheered up?

431
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:43,485
Barry, I have a back brace
in my bedroom.

432
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,495
If you could just help me
get off this couch...

433
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:47,822
Sure.

434
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:50,266
I wan! to do this
very slowly and carefully.

435
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,327
On the count of...

436
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:53,494
Three!

437
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,909
- All you.
- All right.

438
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,918
Now, I... If I could just...

439
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:13,582
You can do it. You got it!

440
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,855
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Tim!

441
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:19,431
- You got this! I'll help!
- No, no, no! I have it.

442
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:21,700
- All right.
- I'm good.

443
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,801
Tim, you look good!

444
00:30:33,027 --> 00:30:34,097
What are you doing?

445
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:38,342
- What are you doing?
- Computer,

446
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,212
Oh, my God!
You gave her my address?!

447
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:47,548
- She's very concerned about you.
- Barry, this woman is a nightmare.

448
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,481
She's been stalking me
for three years!

449
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:53,114
I slept with her one night,
biggest mistake of my life.

450
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:56,626
- It was before I even met Julie.
- Why did you do that?

451
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,624
Because it was New Years
and I was drunk

452
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,324
and she was wearing
these fishnet stockings.

453
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:02,628
You want me to
tell her not to come?

454
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,633
Go. Go.

455
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:09,968
Come to dinner tomorrow
and that's it. Let's go. Move!

456
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:12,168
Come on! Go, go!

457
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:17,480
- Oh, my God, what have you done?
- I'm gonna make it up to you.

458
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:50,077
OK! OK!

459
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:53,782
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little miss panty bottom.

460
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:57,018
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I am a friend of Tim's.

461
00:31:57,178 --> 00:31:59,590
- Yeah, I don't know you.
- Oh, you don't?

462
00:31:59,914 --> 00:32:01,359
So you know everything about Tim?

463
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:05,089
You are the world's greatest
expert on all things Tim?

464
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,396
Did Tim invite you
to a dinner tomorrow night?

465
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,628
According to him,
it is tomorrow night, yes.

466
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:14,069
Right. You want my advice?

467
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,206
- Don't go.
- OK, may I give you some advice, too?

468
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,246
Do not wear fishnets on New Year's Eve.

469
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:25,647
It's too cold. When the wind blows,
you gotta go with the hose.

470
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:29,050
- You know what? I really need to...
- Now, Darla, Darla, come on,,,

471
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:31,384
- Darla?
- Yes. He told me all about you.

472
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:34,392
Really? What did Tim tell you about me?

473
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:37,556
Told me about the sex.

474
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,890
The Sex?

475
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:44,665
The dirty, dirty sex. But he lives
with a woman named Julie,

476
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,794
and if she comes home
and Ends you, that, that...

477
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:48,771
You can imagine how she would feel.

478
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,740
Yeah, I imagine
she'd be pretty pissed off.

479
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,636
I gotta nip this in the bud.

480
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:57,142
- You gotta move along.
- You tell your friend, Tim, he can...

481
00:32:57,271 --> 00:32:59,012
You tell him he can kiss my ass.

482
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:01,247
Don't have to. We have a picture.

483
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:09,024
Problem solved. l intercepted
your stalker in the hallway.

484
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,154
Darla showed up?
And you got her to leave?

485
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:15,665
Oh, I don't think you're
ever gonna see her again.

486
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:23,532
- Who is that?
- Kieran Vollard. He's an artist.

487
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:27,271
Very attractive man. He can it
a whole octopus in his mouth.

488
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:29,541
Sort of an animal magnetism
about him.

489
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,172
That's what Julie says.

490
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:35,643
"For Julie.
Thanks for everything. Kieran."

491
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:40,056
- Everything?
- Yeah, she curated his show.

492
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:42,786
Bet that's not all she curated.

493
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:45,324
I don't know what that means, Barry.

494
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:48,024
Well, I don't know
what curated means.

495
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:49,156
Where is she?

496
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:53,302
Working.

497
00:33:54,228 --> 00:33:56,174
Probably with Kieran.

498
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:59,335
Where? In his bed?

499
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:02,812
I seriously doubt
they're working in his bed.

500
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:05,510
Well, if they're not working,
why are they in his bed?

501
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:09,420
Tim, you need to call Kieran's house
and see if she's there.

502
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:10,716
I'm not doing that.

503
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,381
It's the only way you're
gonna know for sure.

504
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:14,151
- I'm not calling.
- I'm telling you...

505
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:17,821
No, I'm not gonna call Kieran
and say I don't know where Julie is.

506
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,396
- Do it. Do it.
- No. No.

507
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,521
All right, I will.

508
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:23,101
What reason could you possibly
have for calling him?

509
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:25,704
I want to make
a movie about his life.

510
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:28,670
I want to make a documentary.
I gain his confidence,

511
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:31,503
and then he starts feeling more
relaxed about talking to me.

512
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,509
He's really opening up to me.

513
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,841
We're talking about his
sex life and then...

514
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:39,578
...Julie's name pops up
and we've got it on tape!

515
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:41,618
- Yeah.
- He's been curated!

516
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:44,713
Well, that sounds like
a bullet-proof plan.

517
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:46,847
What's his number?

518
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:50,427
-One-1-1...1-1...
- Hold on.

519
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:52,186
OK. Go.

520
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,855
- One-1 -1
- Got that.

521
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,633
One-1

522
00:34:55,756 --> 00:34:57,463
- One-1.
- OK.

523
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:06,276
He must've changed his number.
I'm just getting a weird sound.

524
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:08,478
Oh, well. We tried.

525
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:12,273
There he is. Kieran Vollard. I got him.

526
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,209
Don'!! Don't!

527
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:17,818
- I'm serious. Don't call him.
- it's ringing...

528
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:19,322
Hang up the phone.

529
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:20,926
Hang up the phone!

530
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:22,755
I'm gonna do an accent.

531
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:24,885
Don't do an accent.
Hang up the phone.

532
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:28,625
- Hello?
- Hello! How are you?

533
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:30,599
This is Nigel!

534
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:33,433
I'm a documentary filmmaker

535
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:35,939
-from London, England.
- Hang up!

536
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:38,839
May I speak to Kieran Vollard, please?

537
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:41,572
- This is Kieran.
- Kieran.

538
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:45,310
I want to make a documentary
about your life.

539
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:50,153
Start the water i'll be right in.
Yeah, I could do an Interview.

540
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:54,191
Smashing! Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams!

541
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:56,522
I will have my man-servant
Contact you with the details.

542
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:58,597
That sounded like Julie's laugh.

543
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:01,757
She might've been there!

544
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:04,427
- I'm going over there.
- No, Tim!

545
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:07,599
You can't drive in this condition.

546
00:36:08,996 --> 00:36:11,476
Clutch! Oh, God, use the clu...

547
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,943
You can't just shift.
You need to use the clutch, Barry.

548
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:15,440
Oh, God.

549
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:21,681
OK, hold on. I'll get it.

550
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:27,948
No, no, no, no...

551
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:29,458
- OK.
- I got it.

552
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,161
She's gotta be in there.

553
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:42,003
Just need to get her attention.

554
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,140
Those were my car keys, weren't they?

555
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:02,684
Oh, God.

556
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:09,824
Here we go. Let's do this thing.

557
00:37:09,924 --> 00:37:13,736
Barry! Barry, just...
Just get the keys and come back!

558
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:16,174
Barry!

559
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:22,514
I am inside the apartment.

560
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:25,777
I know. I want you out of the apartment.
Get the keys and let's get out of here!

561
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:28,614
Oh, Tim, I wish you could
see this place! It's amazing!

562
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,620
I thought you had
a great apartment.. This...

563
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:34,784
This, my friend... Oh, my God!

564
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:40,063
He's friends with Morgan Freeman.

565
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,696
Please get the hell out of there.

566
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:48,097
He's coming!

567
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:31,145
- Cat got the Tim mouse!
- Forget about the mouse! Come on!

568
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:33,914
Get the keys and get out of there!

569
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,246
Forget the mouse!

570
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:49,931
Thank you. Hey! He's OK!

571
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:52,265
Hide! Hide!

572
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:09,512
Kieran, I'm ready.

573
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:14,651
Barry!

574
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:16,454
Barry!

575
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:21,388
Julie's here.

576
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:27,904
Oh, yes..

577
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:30,664
Sounds like they're having intercourse.

578
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:33,404
That's it. Oh, fantastic.

579
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:40,813
I'm having trouble describing
what I'm looking at.

580
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:43,216
Fly, fly...

581
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:48,850
Yes! Primordial...

582
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:58,192
Hello.

583
00:39:59,426 --> 00:40:00,427
Who are you?

584
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:01,996
I'm...

585
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:05,168
Monique, Christina, this is Tim.

586
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:07,103
He's a stockbroker,
or something like that.

587
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:10,904
- Tim, can I help you?
- No, no, no. Sorry, I...

588
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:12,176
I'm Nigel Nigel!

589
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:16,010
- I'm here doing a documentary!
- You can stop that now, Barry.

590
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:20,852
My name's not Barry! So, what
have you done with Julie?

591
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:23,757
Tim... has Julie left you?

592
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:29,089
Oh, Tim. I was always very
attracted to Julie and I still am.

593
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,031
You must be broken.
She's a wonderful creature.

594
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:33,193
Stop...

595
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,203
I have to say, though, Tim,
I'm not surprised.

596
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,531
- Really?
- There's not a lot of monogamy

597
00:40:37,698 --> 00:40:41,703
in the animal kingdom. Not many
animals mate for life. Penguins do.

598
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:44,214
I've spent a lot of time with penguins,
and they're really cool.

599
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:47,784
And maybe you're a penguin, Tim,
but Julie's not a penguin.

600
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:52,050
She's a lioness. Don't try
to mate a lioness with a penguin.

601
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:57,252
Ever. Have you ever seen
a mammal and a bird mate?

602
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:59,159
I've never even heard of that.

603
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:02,756
Is that right?
You gonna try and tame her?

604
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:08,101
- 'Cause I don't think you're her type.
- Maybe. But I have something.

605
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,230
Something that women respond to.

606
00:41:10,564 --> 00:41:13,738
That's true. Julie and I
have been saying that.

607
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:17,906
- Tim doesn't get it.
- He's right. Listen to your friend.

608
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,952
Am I gonna make love with
Christina and Monique tonight?

609
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:24,249
Yeah! Hell, yes! Guilty.
You caught me out. Yeah.

610
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:26,584
But only because
it's part of my process.

611
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,250
Your "process"?

612
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:30,152
There are two things in this world:

613
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:36,127
Wonderful, visceral, sexy sex...

614
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,667
...and death.

615
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,967
Horrible, boring death.

616
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:47,268
Now, I'm gonna go off and have some
sex with these girls before I die.

617
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:48,711
Go ahead.

618
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:51,043
If you guys wanna join, that's cool.

619
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:53,276
But don't look at me in the eye.
It puts me off.

620
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:56,150
- What?
- OK, you're not into it. That's cool.

621
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:59,553
Good to see ya, Tim,
Thanks for visiting. Great to meet you.

622
00:42:03,617 --> 00:42:05,460
I wanna grow a beard.

623
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:10,032
I know you're set on a
documentary, but hear me out...

624
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:14,333
Charlize Theron plays Julie.
Kieran plays himself.

625
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:16,634
I don't know.
It is something to think about.

626
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:18,140
Three, two, one...

627
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:22,976
Oh, my God.

628
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,313
Oh, my God!
How did you do that?

629
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:31,152
A human back and a rodent back
are eerily similar.

630
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,317
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

631
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:35,416
Now, go.

632
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,492
- What about dinner?
- It's tomorrow, Barry. Tomorrow.

633
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,900
That's interesting.

634
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:47,028
You say you're over Darla and yet you
have a picture of her in your apartment.

635
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:48,765
How does Julie feel about that?

636
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:53,545
That is Julie.

637
00:42:57,438 --> 00:43:00,282
Barry, is that the woman
you talked to in the hallway?

638
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,921
Well...

639
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,415
Well...

640
00:43:08,182 --> 00:43:10,184
She has the same face.

641
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,528
I'll get the door.

642
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:17,791
Where's Tim?

643
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:24,706
- Oh, God.
- Well, well.

644
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:29,971
You blew it with Julie.
Just like you blew it with me.

645
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:34,712
Poor little Timmy.
You missed your chance.

646
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,048
And you'll never have me again.

647
00:43:37,144 --> 00:43:40,387
- Let's go.
- You're hurting me.

648
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:43,951
- I'm not," Stop it.
- Please, stop hurting me.

649
00:43:44,084 --> 00:43:47,930
- I'm not even touching you.
- Why do we keep doing this?

650
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:51,930
You know, some day,
I'm really gonna leave you.

651
00:43:57,998 --> 00:44:00,308
All right, go, go!
Get out of my house, right now!

652
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:04,443
You're very cruel, Tim.

653
00:44:05,072 --> 00:44:07,916
- Hello.
- Who's your friend?

654
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:09,611
Barry, his name's Barry.

655
00:44:11,178 --> 00:44:13,454
Wanna watch while I screw
Barry's brains out?

656
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,255
- I can honestly say no to that one.
- Oh, really?

657
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:20,163
So, do you guys wanna get pizza?

658
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:25,096
Wanna lick cheese
off my naked body?

659
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:26,829
I'm sure Tim has plates.

660
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,262
Hello?

661
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:30,774
Hey, who's Darla?
I just met your friend earlier

662
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,309
He told me some pretty
interesting things

663
00:44:32,432 --> 00:44:34,469
- about this woman.
- What did he saw

664
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:38,447
- Oh, I don't know. He spoke about...
- Oh, wow, you're like a friendly dog.

665
00:44:38,772 --> 00:44:40,877
- ...talked about sex...
- What?

666
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:42,351
What exactly did he say?

667
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:44,387
Can you just tell me?
Are you cheating on me?

668
00:44:44,711 --> 00:44:46,782
It's not a difficult
question to answer!

669
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,521
- Hello? Are you cheating on me?
- She put it in her pants.

670
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:52,790
Tim! I don't know why it's
so hard for you to answer..

671
00:44:52,953 --> 00:44:54,899
Julie! You're crazy to think
that I'm cheating on you!

672
00:44:55,022 --> 00:44:58,003
That's insane!
Where are you? Where are you?

673
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,696
- Julie!
- I think I hung up.

674
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:02,696
You have no right!

675
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:05,908
No right? Barry, we're gonna be a while.

676
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,478
- You're a crazy person.
- All right, I'll be here.

677
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:11,476
Hey, Tim? Tim?

678
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:13,978
- Tim?
- Oh, God...

679
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:17,020
Tim? Timmy Tim?

680
00:45:17,144 --> 00:45:19,556
What do you say?
Should we drive him crazy?

681
00:45:20,147 --> 00:45:21,820
OK!

682
00:45:21,915 --> 00:45:25,089
I'm a naughty little schoolgirl!

683
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:26,994
You look a little old
to be a schoolgirl.

684
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:29,192
I need to be punished.

685
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:31,530
Hey, Naomi, how you doing? It's Tim.

686
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:33,763
I'm wondering if
you've heard from Julie.

687
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:36,204
Don't you wanna be my schoolteacher?

688
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,401
I'm really not qualified.
I work for the IRS.

689
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:40,443
- No, no, no...
- Not tonight.

690
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:43,270
- No, all the time. I work...
- OK, OK.

691
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:47,874
You work for the IRS,
and I have been very...

692
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:51,387
- ...very bad.
- Have you heard from Julie?

693
00:45:51,511 --> 00:45:53,115
- I haven't paid my taxes...
- No?

694
00:45:53,247 --> 00:45:56,524
...and I need to be spanked! Now!

695
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,523
Well, that's really
not the way it works.

696
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:01,259
You probably just have to pay
the difference, plus interest.

697
00:46:01,388 --> 00:46:03,026
OK, I...

698
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:05,433
- I need you to spank me real hard.
- I'm looking for Julie.

699
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:08,205
Spank me hard, Barry!

700
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:10,366
- Barry!
- No, no. That's the TV.

701
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,876
Oh, yeah! Oh, Barry!

702
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:18,573
Yeah! Oh, Barry!

703
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:26,081
Oh, Barry!

704
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:29,456
If she gets in touch with you, please
tell her to call me. It's an emergency.

705
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:32,491
You're like some
crazy animal all over...

706
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:35,561
- I wanna be a penguin!
- I like to eat penguins.

707
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:37,493
Hope you don't catch me.
Penguins are very slow.

708
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:39,394
Except I'm Turbo Penguin!

709
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:43,440
Come here... I'm gonna catch you...

710
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:46,937
Did you hurt your knee?

711
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:50,640
Barry, that's funny,
You are a bad little penguin.

712
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:53,640
Don't get me!

713
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:56,480
Come here!

714
00:47:05,652 --> 00:47:09,327
- You're gonna die.
- No, I'm not.

715
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,761
Oh, God.

716
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,440
God!

717
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:36,850
Barry?

718
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:41,232
Tim? Call me! OK?

719
00:47:41,355 --> 00:47:44,632
This was so much fun! I love you!

720
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:48,295
Foreever! And ever...

721
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,917
Barry! Barry.

722
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:07,488
Works every time.

723
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:11,390
If you are attacked,
you should always play dead.

724
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:13,555
People don't want to punch
something that's dead.

725
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:15,264
- it's instinctual.
- She's gone?

726
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:17,335
Yes, she is.

727
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:20,165
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, we had a little bit of a ruckus.

728
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,001
Oh, my God!

729
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:24,436
- That your phone?
- Julie's.

730
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:31,705
Kieran.

731
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:36,385
Hey listen, when you get up there,
let the horse into the pasture.

732
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,581
She loves to run around in the grass.

733
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:40,749
Grab a bottle of wine,
make yourself a fire,

734
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:43,521
stay as long as you want.
This is gonna be good for you.

735
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:46,962
- She's going to his ranch.
- Oh, my God.

736
00:48:48,422 --> 00:48:50,026
- That's code.
- What?

737
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:53,366
It's code, Tim.
You should watch Law & Order:

738
00:48:54,394 --> 00:48:59,537
Horse is heroin. Grass is marijuana.

739
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:02,976
The horse likes to
run around on the grass.

740
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:05,743
The heroin likes to
run around on the marijuana.

741
00:49:06,873 --> 00:49:10,082
Wine. Alcohol.

742
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,951
Like beer. Or wine.

743
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,724
Oh, man, they are planning
one hell of a party.

744
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:17,793
It's gonna be wild up there.

745
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:22,264
I think that you need to get out of
my house in the next... 30 seconds,

746
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,630
before I beat you to death
with the chair that you're sitting in.

747
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,768
- What?
- You have to go. I want you to go.

748
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:32,335
- Who's gonna help you with Julie?
- Who's gonna help me with Julie?

749
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:34,104
You didn't really
just say that, did you?

750
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:36,145
Because of you,
Julie thinks I'm having an affair

751
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:37,646
and she's on her way to Kieran's ranch!

752
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:40,081
Whatever you do,
don't help me with Julie!

753
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,516
We should go there and we should
explain the whole mix-up.

754
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:45,782
I don't know where it is. It's unlisted!
He goes there to disappear!

755
00:49:45,912 --> 00:49:50,190
Please, please, I'm begging you!
Go, leave, go!

756
00:49:50,317 --> 00:49:51,352
I'm sorry.

757
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,656
I'm sorry, Tim.

758
00:49:59,926 --> 00:50:03,271
Wait. Tim, Tim!

759
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,606
I work at the Canoga Processing Center.

760
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:11,772
It's only the second-largest [RS
processing center on the west coast.

761
00:50:11,938 --> 00:50:13,713
And you're telling me
this now because...?

762
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,289
If Kieran has a ranch, we can
ind the address from his tax return.

763
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:23,123
And if he's up there sleeping
with Julie, that's not business-related.

764
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:24,559
He can't deduct that.

765
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:31,167
- You can get me his tax returns?
- No. But I know somebody who can.

766
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:35,405
- There it is, The mother ship.
- It looks deserted.

767
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:38,635
No, no, no. He's in there.
My boss never sleeps.

768
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:41,074
Be careful around this guy.

769
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:43,807
- He can tell what you're thinking.
- What are you talking about?

770
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:47,408
Don't look him in the eye.
Don't think any embarrassing thoughts.

771
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,249
Just keep your mind blank.

772
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:58,328
Therman? I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Tim Conrad.

773
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:00,393
Hi.

774
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:05,762
I could use some help and Barry says
you're just the man for the job.

775
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:07,761
Have 3 Seat.

776
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:11,442
I did an audit on a
Steven Conrad two years ago.

777
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:12,600
Any relation?

778
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:16,180
- Where does he live?
- Bayside State Prison.

779
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:17,838
He's doing seven years.

780
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:21,852
Are you hiding something, Mr, Conrad?

781
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:26,351
- What is it that you do for a living?
- Don't ask. He makes money.

782
00:51:26,513 --> 00:51:28,618
Nobody knows
where it comes from, though.

783
00:51:28,748 --> 00:51:30,625
Shall we take a look
at his return, Barry?

784
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:36,193
Guys, I think we're
getting a little off track here.

785
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:38,394
- Look, I'm in a little bit of a rush.
- That's him.

786
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:42,936
Guys, I don't have much time, so...

787
00:51:45,298 --> 00:51:47,039
Mr. Conrad...

788
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:52,712
Men lie to me a thousand times a day.

789
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,781
And my job is to
End the truth. Right, Barry?

790
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,553
I've studied the human mind.

791
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:06,892
I've learned how to read it and,
ultimately, control it.

792
00:52:06,987 --> 00:52:08,898
This is fascinating,
I can't wait to read it.

793
00:52:08,989 --> 00:52:11,128
It's $14.99 on my website,

794
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:13,737
- OK.
- Plus shipping and handling.

795
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:15,395
Even if I buy it here?

796
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:19,568
It's shipped from somewhere else,
isn't it? And I've been handling it.

797
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:23,439
Could you just tell Therman
why we're here?

798
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,746
We are looking for an address
of a nondeductible vacation property.

799
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:31,114
You are looking for
someone or something.

800
00:52:33,146 --> 00:52:37,458
That's exactly right.
Tim is looking for his girlfriend.

801
00:52:37,584 --> 00:52:41,191
She ran off with an artist.
They are probably sleeping together.

802
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:43,267
- Oh, God...
- Your girlfriend has left you.

803
00:52:43,423 --> 00:52:46,870
- Tim, he can see right through you.
- Well, you also just told him that.

804
00:52:47,193 --> 00:52:49,503
Are you still skeptical, Mr, Conrad?

805
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,206
Watch this. Barry...

806
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:55,869
What is he doing?

807
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:01,276
He's making me do something.
What is he making me do?

808
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:02,682
You're not doing anything, Barry.

809
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:04,880
That's right, Barry.
You're not doing anything.

810
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:08,283
I'm not doing anything.

811
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:13,558
- I'm paralyzed, Oh, God.
- God can't hear you, Barry.

812
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:15,633
- Tim?
- Tim can't hear you, Barry.

813
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:19,966
- No, actually, I can hear him.
- My body's a prison.

814
00:53:21,394 --> 00:53:26,309
This is so painful,
I can't move, Tim.

815
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:30,671
Tim, help me. Help me, Tim.

816
00:53:30,804 --> 00:53:33,307
All right, you know what, Barry?
Just move. You can do it. Just move.

817
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:38,812
I release you.

818
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:46,724
OK, I will never take movement
for granted, ever again.

819
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:50,934
Well, I was wrong. Apparently,
his brain really is your puppet.

820
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:52,861
I need an address.

821
00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:56,872
- Can you help me, please?
- Perhaps. For a price.

822
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:57,997
How much?

823
00:53:58,164 --> 00:54:02,704
I just need to hear Barry say,
"You can eat my pudding."

824
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:05,280
No.

825
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:09,009
Barry, I can make you say it.

826
00:54:09,342 --> 00:54:14,621
But with your own free will, say,
"You can eat my pudding."

827
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:16,591
I'm not gonna say it.

828
00:54:17,217 --> 00:54:19,026
Barry, I'm gonna eat it, anyway!

829
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,033
But I want you to say,
"You can eat my pudding!"

830
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:28,036
Barry, I will give you a thousand
dollars if you say it, right now.

831
00:54:28,361 --> 00:54:32,138
A thousand dollars?
Barry, your friend is a high roller.

832
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:36,370
- You are hiding something.
- Wait a minute. No, wait...

833
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,543
Can we just stick to the issue at hand?

834
00:54:40,373 --> 00:54:44,048
You almost had me. But you cannot
declare offshore investment losses

835
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:48,416
against future capital gains.
Any child knows that.

836
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:52,553
I'll have to ask
my accountant about that.

837
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:12,610
Mr. Conrad...

838
00:55:13,273 --> 00:55:15,685
,,,you, my friend... are being audited.

839
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,755
NO, HO, HO.

840
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:19,857
Call the 800 number.

841
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:22,593
I release you.

842
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,800
Hey, Tim?

843
00:55:30,432 --> 00:55:33,538
I guess you just have to remember
what te wise man once said...

844
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,246
"Everything happens for a reason."

845
00:55:38,774 --> 00:55:41,050
- You know who said that?
- Shut up, Barry.

846
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,554
- You did. You're the wise man.
- Don't talk.

847
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:46,592
Don't say a word.
Don't move your lips.

848
00:55:50,218 --> 00:55:55,167
Oh, my God. It's Martha.
it's my ex-wife.

849
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:03,999
There's my magic man.

850
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:17,787
- Look at you. OK,
- Get in the car, Pudding.

851
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:30,597
I used to call her Pudding.

852
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:35,772
Look, why don't we just each
go home, we'll get some sleep,

853
00:56:35,864 --> 00:56:37,002
and I'll see you tomorrow at the dinner.

854
00:56:37,332 --> 00:56:38,868
OK.

855
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,043
I think I left my bus pass
at your apartment.

856
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:46,118
- I'll drive you home.
- OK.

857
00:56:48,043 --> 00:56:50,284
I left my keys at your apartment, too.

858
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,986
That's OK. You know what?
I'll just sleep here. I have a cubicle.

859
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:56,959
- I can pull two chairs together.
- it's all right.

860
00:56:57,118 --> 00:56:59,530
- Get in the car.
- I can fashion them into a bed.

861
00:56:59,654 --> 00:57:02,191
They... Well, they son of
roll apart in the middle, so...

862
00:57:02,324 --> 00:57:03,962
- Barry, Barry...
- ...you sag,

863
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,071
- You can stay with me.
- Don't worry about me.

864
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:08,572
- I insist.
- Really?

865
00:57:08,697 --> 00:57:11,143
- Yeah.
- I won't cramp your style?

866
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:14,077
- it's already cramped.
- OK.

867
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:28,491
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna propose to her?

868
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,652
I have, a few times.

869
00:57:30,819 --> 00:57:33,163
- Why do you keep carrying this around?
- In case she changes her mind.

870
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:35,695
- Please don't go through my pockets.
- OK.

871
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,196
Hey, Tim?

872
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:44,168
The first night alone
is always the hardest.

873
00:57:44,499 --> 00:57:47,105
I can sleep in there
with you if you want.

874
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:49,007
No, thank you.

875
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,172
Hey, just don't think about
the fact that you can't sleep.

876
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:54,680
Because then you're sunk. Then you
just start thinking, "Whats going on?"

877
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:57,756
Your mind starts reeling.
"Where's Julie?

878
00:57:57,879 --> 00:58:00,689
Oh, she's with Kieran.
Is he a better lover than I am?

879
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:03,625
Yes, he is." Don't think about that.

880
00:58:03,752 --> 00:58:05,595
Get those thoughts out of your head.

881
00:58:06,922 --> 00:58:11,598
- Why are you putting on aftershave?
- Force of habit.

882
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:14,639
When I was married, I used to
stay up late working on my mice,

883
00:58:14,763 --> 00:58:16,902
and Martha hated
the smell of formaldehyde.

884
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:23,306
You can smell them both, Barry.
Two layers of bad smell,

885
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,379
That's exactly what Martha used to say.

886
00:58:29,077 --> 00:58:30,317
Good night.

887
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,297
Tim?

888
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:47,637
- Tim?
- What, Barry?

889
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:49,571
I can't sleep.
I'm too excited about dinner.

890
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:51,735
- Oh, God!
- What are you gonna wear?

891
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,244
Should I rent a tux?
Or is that too formal?

892
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:55,246
Here's the thing:

893
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,414
It's always better to be overdressed
than underdressed, right?

894
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:08,322
Thanks, Tim! That's great!

895
00:59:09,317 --> 00:59:13,356
Oh, he ate it! He's eating paper!

896
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:15,526
NO...

897
01:00:20,822 --> 01:00:24,929
I'll be back in a few hours.
Don't play with the stove.

898
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,734
Don't do anything with electricity.

899
01:00:28,997 --> 01:00:30,601
Do you understand?

900
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:32,871
Sometimes I think
you think I'm an idiot.

901
01:00:33,001 --> 01:00:35,277
Just stay in the chair. Promise me.

902
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:39,351
I will. I will stay in the chair.
Why is this brunch so important?

903
01:00:39,674 --> 01:00:41,620
Because the future
of my career depends on it.

904
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:43,723
It's a very important potential client.

905
01:00:43,845 --> 01:00:45,688
- I can help.
- You want to help me?

906
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:47,793
- Stay in the chair.
- OK.

907
01:00:48,516 --> 01:00:51,087
I'll pick you up for dinner. All right?

908
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:55,226
- You gonna stay in that chair?
- Yes.

909
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:56,562
That's it.

910
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,901
Hello?

911
01:01:07,035 --> 01:01:09,208
You got everything
you need for brunch?

912
01:01:10,138 --> 01:01:14,644
OK, you got me working Saturday,
so I'm billing you overtime for this.

913
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:17,757
You're going to
Madison Restaurant, 10am.

914
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:21,884
Don't be late, They're Swiss.
And make sure Julie's there.

915
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:25,156
- They're dying to meet her.
- OK, Julie'll be there.

916
01:01:26,654 --> 01:01:27,758
Tim?

917
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:29,459
Tim!

918
01:01:30,959 --> 01:01:32,404
Tim?

919
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:48,613
Tim? Tim! Tim!

920
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:51,184
Hi, Tim? We switched phones.

921
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:54,987
I need to talk to you.
Julie has to go to that brunch! OK.

922
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:04,436
Hi, Tim, me again. I just
realized you can't get my messages.

923
01:02:04,759 --> 01:02:09,538
My password is P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D. OK.

924
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,506
Oh, God!

925
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:16,607
You can't get that message,
either! Why am I...'?!

926
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:25,123
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

927
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:28,349
We feared that some
disaster had befallen you.

928
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:31,459
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- And where is...?

929
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:35,795
Julie sends her regrets.
She dropped a box on her foot

930
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:40,066
- and broke a distal phalange.
- Please wish her a swift recovery.

931
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:43,005
I had hoped for another woman
to lend some poetry.

932
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:44,804
I understood from my husband

933
01:02:44,966 --> 01:02:47,810
I would not have to suffer
another business conversation.

934
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:50,347
What was it Baudelaire said?

935
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:52,917
"Misunderstanding makes
the world go 'round."

936
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,385
I see we will
have poetry after all.

937
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,753
It is rare to find an American
businessman with a sense of culture.

938
01:03:10,425 --> 01:03:14,396
Tim! It's me again! Barry!
Disregard all previous messages!

939
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:18,506
I figured it out!
Help is on the way! Bye!

940
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:23,382
Obviously, many of the
strategies are complex.

941
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:27,418
- I imagine you have several questions.
- I am a simple man, Mr. Conrad.

942
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:31,513
My father left me with very little,
except for all of his money.

943
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:34,853
The world is full of people
who want to separate me from it.

944
01:03:35,016 --> 01:03:38,520
Why should I trust you
with $100 million?

945
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:40,529
A very fair question.

946
01:03:41,522 --> 01:03:44,867
Now, you're obviously
very civilized people.

947
01:03:45,026 --> 01:03:48,439
But, unfortunately, the world
of finance is a brutal place.

948
01:03:48,763 --> 01:03:53,041
The good hunters win.
The bad hunters lose.

949
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:55,442
I am a very good hunter.

950
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,546
You are refreshingly honest,
Mr. Conrad.

951
01:03:58,706 --> 01:04:02,119
I try to be. I hope we can
do business together.

952
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:04,646
A call for you, sir.

953
01:04:07,882 --> 01:04:10,089
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me. Hello?

954
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:11,458
I got your back, Wm.
Can you hear me?

955
01:04:11,786 --> 01:04:12,958
- Hello?
- Hello!

956
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:14,293
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

957
01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:15,833
Hello. Hello.

958
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:22,341
Hello. My name is Tim's brother,
Barry, and this is Julie.

959
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:25,103
Tim, look. I brought Julie.

960
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:29,181
Hi, my love.
Oh, I have missed you so.

961
01:04:30,738 --> 01:04:31,739
YOU...

962
01:04:32,907 --> 01:04:35,945
You know... Your phalange.
You shouldn't be here.

963
01:04:36,077 --> 01:04:39,251
Nonsense,
She is the picture of health.

964
01:04:39,347 --> 01:04:42,021
Please. Sit. Sit, sit.

965
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:47,189
Thank you.

966
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:52,334
- Birgit Mueller.
- Such a pleasure.

967
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,963
- Martin Mueller, delighted.
- Such a pleasure.

968
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:57,975
And I am Barry. Delightful.

969
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:03,614
I am so pleased you could join us.
I always say you do not know a man

970
01:05:03,938 --> 01:05:06,544
until you meet his partner in love.

971
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:10,451
I couldn't agree more. I would love
to go over some of these main points.

972
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:14,457
- Where are you from?!
- We are from Switzerland.

973
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:16,529
You know what?
We're gonna focus on business.

974
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:20,292
Switzerland! I love Switzerland.
It is one of my favorite countries.

975
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:23,629
I love your army knives
with the toothpicks,

976
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:28,907
And your cheese. Does the cheese
come out of the cow with the holes?

977
01:05:30,732 --> 01:05:34,236
Our countries are not enemies.
They are friends.

978
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:37,578
- We are friends,
- You have been to Switzerland?

979
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:40,481
No, bull have a friend
who drives a Volvo.

980
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:42,746
And I speak a little of your language.

981
01:05:48,216 --> 01:05:50,822
That's my brother. Always joking.

982
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,331
It's a jokey joke, ja?

983
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:04,666
You know, we should continue
this conversation back in my office.

984
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:07,574
But I have not received my salmon.

985
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,375
Or my green salad.

986
01:06:15,076 --> 01:06:16,384
So...

987
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:20,687
...do you and Julie have
wedding bells in your future?

988
01:06:20,848 --> 01:06:24,887
That's kind of a sore topic. He keeps
asking her, but she keeps saying no.

989
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,628
- Ask me again.
- No, it's not the right time.

990
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:34,565
If a woman asks you to propose,
it is the right time.

991
01:06:35,296 --> 01:06:36,366
Really, I can't.

992
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:38,772
- Why not?
- Do it. Do it!

993
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,743
- I don't have a ring.
- Yeah, you do.

994
01:06:40,868 --> 01:06:43,576
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do, it's in your pocket.

995
01:06:43,704 --> 01:06:47,117
- Come on, You know you have it...
- Barry...

996
01:06:47,241 --> 01:06:51,417
- Told ya.
- You are a hunter, Mr. Conrad.

997
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:53,617
There is nothing more
honorable than for a man

998
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:55,928
to join himself to his lady love.

999
01:06:56,717 --> 01:07:01,063
Join yourself to her.
In the name of love.

1000
01:07:01,155 --> 01:07:03,658
Join yourself in the name of love.

1001
01:07:05,259 --> 01:07:08,968
You must kneel, Mr. Conrad.
She is a princess.

1002
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:11,242
Thank you.

1003
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:22,677
Something's happening!

1004
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:26,148
- Julie,,,
- Call me Darla.

1005
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,784
- Oh, I don't want to call you Darla.
- Julie's just a nickname.

1006
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:33,455
- I want it to be real.
- Look into her eyes.

1007
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:35,193
Look, look.

1008
01:07:36,924 --> 01:07:41,202
There is your home.
There is your future.

1009
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:43,798
I love you, Tim.

1010
01:07:44,999 --> 01:07:46,706
Do it, do it, do it!

1011
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,780
Do it!

1012
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,713
- Julie.
- Darla.

1013
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:54,713
Darla. Will you marry me?

1014
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:57,454
Yes. Yes!

1015
01:07:58,646 --> 01:08:00,057
LOOK at that. We did it.

1016
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:13,733
- Julie.
- I thought this was Julie.

1017
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:16,398
- Nope. I'm Julie.
- They are both Julie.

1018
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:18,135
Julie and Julie.

1019
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,303
Susana thought you were
gonna lose your promotion

1020
01:08:20,468 --> 01:08:21,811
if I didn't show up today.

1021
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:25,578
Look at you. You had
a replacement all lined up.

1022
01:08:25,706 --> 01:08:27,515
-Yeah.
- No, no, no.

1023
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:30,179
- This is a huge misunderstanding.
- Let me explain.

1024
01:08:30,311 --> 01:08:34,191
This is Darla. She's a naughty
schoolgirl who cheats on her taxes.

1025
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:36,056
I didn't know whether
you were gonna come today,

1026
01:08:36,183 --> 01:08:38,720
so I brought Darla to keep
things running smoothly.

1027
01:08:39,053 --> 01:08:41,158
Very important potential client.

1028
01:08:41,322 --> 01:08:43,063
That clears that up.
Yeah. Thank you.

1029
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:47,696
Darling, you're embarrassing
yourself. it's over.

1030
01:08:47,828 --> 01:08:50,775
She's really quite a catch, Tim.
Congratulations.

1031
01:08:51,098 --> 01:08:53,578
- No! Julie...
- Nice to have met you.

1032
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:56,375
- He's very crafty.
-Julie! Julie!

1033
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:59,383
I'm so sorry, I hope we can
continue this at a later date,

1034
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:01,851
- but, actually, I love her.
- Wait, Tim?

1035
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:04,884
- Julie!
- Tim?

1036
01:09:05,746 --> 01:09:07,851
Julie! Julie, look...

1037
01:09:08,182 --> 01:09:10,890
Wait, wait, I know that looked awkward,
but you've gotta trust me.

1038
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:13,862
- Trust you?
- Yes. I trust you.

1039
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:16,868
I know you spent the night at Kieran's
ranch. I know nothing happened.

1040
01:09:17,191 --> 01:09:18,636
Right?

1041
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:20,796
I didn't go to Kieran's ranch
last night.

1042
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:23,374
- I'm going now.
- No! Don't go! Don't go!

1043
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:26,808
Tim, I have to go. It's my job. We're
going to San Francisco this weekend

1044
01:09:27,134 --> 01:09:30,308
to set up for the show. He wants me
to be part of his artistic process.

1045
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:34,443
His artistic process...
That means sex, Julie.

1046
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:36,782
He told me last nigh!
when I broke into his house!

1047
01:09:38,045 --> 01:09:39,547
You broke into his house?

1048
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:45,325
My God. I guess there really
is a you I don't know.

1049
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:49,491
It's too bad. I was so
in love with the other one.

1050
01:09:57,965 --> 01:09:59,501
- Hop in.
- MOVE.

1051
01:09:59,634 --> 01:10:00,772
OK.

1052
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:08,917
Tim, Tim...

1053
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:29,505
May dead!

1054
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:35,941
I don't think you're
a very nice person, Tim.

1055
01:10:36,037 --> 01:10:40,281
Just stay out of my life.
And I'm keeping the ring.

1056
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,887
I think that was really good for her.

1057
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,462
See? It works.

1058
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:09,371
I can't help but think
this is partially my fault.

1059
01:11:09,503 --> 01:11:13,508
Really? Well, it is your fault.
it's 100 percent your fault!

1060
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,156
I'm sorry.

1061
01:11:27,154 --> 01:11:31,000
Hello, Therman. YOU win.

1062
01:11:31,325 --> 01:11:33,362
You can eat my pudding.

1063
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:37,835
Thirty-one Lighthill Drive.
OK, Therman.

1064
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:50,686
I don't even know who he is anymore.
it's like I'm having a bad dream.

1065
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:54,952
I mean, am I crazy?
Am I completely delusional, here?

1066
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:57,518
I don't even know
what's going on anymore.

1067
01:12:00,354 --> 01:12:01,958
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be
unloading this.

1068
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,592
I want to photograph you right now.

1069
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:10,539
I don't think it's the
best time right now, really.

1070
01:12:11,565 --> 01:12:14,978
It is exactly the best time.
I've never seen you like this.

1071
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:19,107
You're so raw, so wonderfully
visible. So beautiful.

1072
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:22,053
This is weird, Kieran.
I don't think we should...

1073
01:12:22,376 --> 01:12:26,620
Not doing this would be weird.
Keep talking. Tell me about Tim.

1074
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:29,284
I don't know. I mean, I just...

1075
01:12:31,585 --> 01:12:34,429
I just always thought that
there was this decent...

1076
01:12:34,555 --> 01:12:37,399
...basic person underneath it all.

1077
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:40,301
You'd think that you would know
someone after two years.

1078
01:12:40,427 --> 01:12:43,738
But, no. That's bad.

1079
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:49,080
He's such a smooth talker.
So convincing.

1080
01:12:49,403 --> 01:12:51,849
I don't even know if anything
he's ever said to me is true.

1081
01:12:51,972 --> 01:12:55,419
- These pictures are gonna be amazing.
- Kieran, you've lost your mind!

1082
01:12:55,509 --> 01:12:57,921
- This is crazy! No!
- Don't light it, It's art.

1083
01:12:58,078 --> 01:12:59,580
I don't want to take pictures.
Can we just stop it?

1084
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:02,953
What are you doing here?

1085
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:05,085
Julie, there's something
I need to tell you.

1086
01:13:05,186 --> 01:13:07,928
- Kieran has gonorrhea.
- No, I don't.

1087
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:09,931
- You might.
- I don't.

1088
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,967
- Well, she does, She has gonorrhea.
- What?

1089
01:13:12,092 --> 01:13:13,765
- Don't sleep with her.
- She doesn't.

1090
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:15,498
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1091
01:13:15,629 --> 01:13:17,609
Because you can get it
from riding the bus.

1092
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,676
- No, you can't.
- Yes, you can, Tim.

1093
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,801
That's how my wife got it.

1094
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:23,506
Barry, no one here has gonorrhea.

1095
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:26,651
I do.

1096
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:30,884
I have gonorrhea.

1097
01:13:33,547 --> 01:13:37,120
I got gonorrhea from my wife,
who got it from a bus seat.

1098
01:13:37,218 --> 01:13:39,198
And no one should sleep with me.

1099
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:45,701
OK.

1100
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:48,534
Could I speak with Julie alone, please?

1101
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:57,175
Tim, you have to tell her
what's in your heart,

1102
01:13:57,304 --> 01:13:59,181
- you have to be honest with her.
- Yeah.

1103
01:13:59,306 --> 01:14:01,479
That's what I did with Martha,
and that did not work.

1104
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:03,815
But I think this'll work for you.

1105
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:07,381
- OK.
- Thank you. All right.

1106
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,536
Have you ever just spent Eve months

1107
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,765
living with a herd of goats,
as one of them?

1108
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,000
- No?
- No.

1109
01:14:24,164 --> 01:14:25,575
That surprises me.

1110
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,846
The thing about a goat is, it never
denies itself what it's hungry for.

1111
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:35,715
A goat will eat anything.
A goat could probably eat a bike.

1112
01:14:38,078 --> 01:14:41,525
A goal could eat itself,
if it was driven to it.

1113
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:46,895
I'm just a goat...

1114
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:50,298
,,,who's halfway through eating itself.

1115
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:59,578
Just to be clear, what exactly
are we talking about?

1116
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:02,544
Everything.

1117
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:08,209
I had no idea. It happened one night
three years ago, before we ever met.

1118
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:10,146
I haven't seen her since.

1119
01:15:10,477 --> 01:15:13,151
So she just popped back up
into your life, like that?

1120
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,222
She tried to get in touch with me
and Barry intercepted the message.

1121
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:21,795
- So it's all Barry's fault?
- Barry is... He's a sweet guy,

1122
01:15:21,922 --> 01:15:27,065
but he is a tornado of destruction.
The only friends he has are dead mice,

1123
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:30,233
and that's 'cause they're the
only ones that can't get away from him.

1124
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:36,674
You know what else mice can't do?

1125
01:15:36,804 --> 01:15:38,750
They can't lie.

1126
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:43,117
Barry. Barry!

1127
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,922
I'm gonna go to San Francisco tonight.

1128
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:50,154
And... I'll come by
to pack around eight.

1129
01:15:50,484 --> 01:15:53,522
I think it's better if you're not there.

1130
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:23,960
I never really knew
what Martha thought of me

1131
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:27,123
until I heard her
talking behind my back.

1132
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,961
You were lying to me the whole time.
You didn't like me.

1133
01:16:35,496 --> 01:16:39,967
"How do I get ahead in business?
How do I get ahead? Oh, I know...

1134
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:44,348
I'll ind a great taxidermist
and I'll hit him with my car.

1135
01:16:44,705 --> 01:16:47,982
And then I'll invite him
to dinner. That'll do it."

1136
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:53,415
Well, somebody forgot to tell you
there is no "me" in "mean."

1137
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:59,696
Well, there is a bit of a happy ending.

1138
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,733
'Cause the mean guy
finally got what he deserved.

1139
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:11,842
World's smallest violin,
and it's playing just for you.

1140
01:17:15,602 --> 01:17:18,549
- Sorry.
- What?

1141
01:17:19,773 --> 01:17:23,186
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, OK. Whatever.

1142
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,981
- Hello?
- Tim!

1143
01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:33,379
I heard you had an
interesting brunch this morning.

1144
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:35,311
Sir, I can explain.

1145
01:19:35,475 --> 01:19:39,082
You might want to explain it
to Mn Mueller

1146
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:43,818
You should have told me
Barry was your fool.

1147
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:46,396
We have the
same game in Switzerland

1148
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,495
Dinner for Unterschlagen.

1149
01:19:48,655 --> 01:19:50,396
I am very much looking forward

1150
01:19:50,724 --> 01:19:53,204
to seeing the two of you
this evening, Mn Conrad

1151
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:57,341
Where are you?
Dinners about to start.

1152
01:19:58,665 --> 01:19:59,837
There's been a complication.

1153
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,947
Tim, for Christ sake,
we're running on fumes.

1154
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,516
If we don't make this deal tonight,
there is no Fender Financial.

1155
01:20:05,839 --> 01:20:08,945
So, hurry up,
We gotta land Mueller tonight.

1156
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:20,356
My guys a lock. You know what
I'm saying? Mueller's gonna love him.

1157
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:21,455
Now, he might be a little late.

1158
01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:23,790
- He's on his way, but...
- Tim!

1159
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:27,031
Sir, I've run into
a little bit of a problem.

1160
01:20:27,194 --> 01:20:29,800
Never mind that. You know,
ever since I invited you to this thing,

1161
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:32,467
Caldwell's been
telling me I made a mistake.

1162
01:20:32,599 --> 01:20:34,135
He says you're not cut out for it.

1163
01:20:34,268 --> 01:20:37,147
- Really?
- Caldwell is full of shit.

1164
01:20:37,271 --> 01:20:42,220
Mueller told me your guy was good.
I had no idea he was this good.

1165
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:44,549
Well, I try to look at the bright side.

1166
01:20:44,878 --> 01:20:47,222
You could say I'm an
eternal optometrist,

1167
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:49,622
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

1168
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,559
Unless you don't have
any water or sugar.

1169
01:20:51,718 --> 01:20:53,425
And then, then you just eat the lemons.

1170
01:20:53,553 --> 01:20:57,057
And the rind will give you diarrhea.
So, mama mia, papa pia,

1171
01:20:57,157 --> 01:20:59,660
baby got the diarr... Hey, Tim!

1172
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:03,965
Mr. Conrad! You have
been missing all the fun.

1173
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:06,574
Barry... you're here.

1174
01:21:06,733 --> 01:21:10,909
Yes, and I have been telling Sir
Lancelot that you deserve a promotion.

1175
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:13,574
And he's been making
a pretty persuasive case, Tim.

1176
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:17,013
Tim, I'd like to
introduce my friend, Lewis,

1177
01:21:17,144 --> 01:21:20,091
- and his wife, Diane.
- Your wife?

1178
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,420
For now.

1179
01:21:22,816 --> 01:21:28,129
- Honey, please.
- Honey, please. You're so pathetic!

1180
01:21:28,255 --> 01:21:31,702
My God, it's raining men.
I don't know who's more gorgeous.

1181
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:34,438
Well, beauty's only skin deep.

1182
01:21:34,594 --> 01:21:37,200
Unless there's something wrong
with your bone structure. And then...

1183
01:21:37,331 --> 01:21:40,471
...you could have flawless skin
and still be very ugly.

1184
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,275
Because your bones are just... gross.

1185
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:46,510
Lewis, Diane, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

1186
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,618
I think you're drunk.

1187
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,182
Not drunk enough to do you.

1188
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:54,217
Tim, when you said this was
a dinner for extraordinary people,

1189
01:21:54,348 --> 01:21:55,986
I had no idea. Look at that.

1190
01:21:56,116 --> 01:21:59,620
Are you hungry?
He hasn't eaten a lot today.

1191
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,624
Come on.

1192
01:22:03,957 --> 01:22:04,958
Yes?

1193
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:08,299
OK... her. You know what she does?

1194
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:10,466
She communicates with dead pets.

1195
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:14,635
Lorenzo's mother wants to talk to him.

1196
01:22:14,968 --> 01:22:17,312
Right? Nice?

1197
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:21,886
OK, that guy? Right there?
2002 National Beard Champion.

1198
01:22:22,008 --> 01:22:24,215
I'm telling you,
these people are amazing.

1199
01:22:24,344 --> 01:22:27,416
- I am so not in their league.
- Barry, what are you...

1200
01:22:27,547 --> 01:22:31,689
- Why are you here?
- Because that's what friends do.

1201
01:22:31,818 --> 01:22:35,163
I know, I know.
You chose some words carelessly.

1202
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:37,599
I know you are in a dark place,
but I also know

1203
01:22:37,924 --> 01:22:41,337
that you need to show your boss
that you are friends with a winner.

1204
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:43,168
In my book, you're a winner, too.

1205
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:48,571
Ladies and gentlemen! Dinner is served.

1206
01:22:54,274 --> 01:22:57,619
The eyes are but two of the Eve senses.

1207
01:22:57,944 --> 01:23:02,359
Remove them and the others
become incredibly sensitive.

1208
01:23:02,516 --> 01:23:04,462
But some people still ask:

1209
01:23:04,584 --> 01:23:08,726
How can a blind man compete
at the Olympic Games as fencer?

1210
01:23:08,855 --> 01:23:10,198
I will show you how.

1211
01:23:14,294 --> 01:23:16,706
Absolutely tremendous!

1212
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:19,374
- All right!
- Are you enjoying this?

1213
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:24,074
Yes. Such a pleasure to laugh
at the misfortune of others.

1214
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:26,584
Are they cute when they're small,

1215
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:29,050
or are they pretty much
horrible the whole time?

1216
01:23:30,444 --> 01:23:34,392
- Are you looking down my dress?
- No.

1217
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:37,087
- Why not?
- I don't know.

1218
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:39,390
- Tim, were you?
- No.

1219
01:23:39,486 --> 01:23:42,228
- Please don't embarrass me.
- I'm not doing... Oh, God.

1220
01:23:45,225 --> 01:23:47,466
- Here you go, sir.
- Here you are, ma'am. Bon appetit.

1221
01:23:56,002 --> 01:23:59,176
I am receiving a message
from the other side!

1222
01:24:02,943 --> 01:24:06,413
I'm trapped.
Where are they taking me?

1223
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:10,756
- She's talking to the lobster.
- The water, it...

1224
01:24:11,418 --> 01:24:12,692
...boils!

1225
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:29,538
Thai might win. Thai might win.

1226
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:39,619
Fuck it. I don't care.

1227
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:45,356
So, Tim... I understand your guest
has an interesting hobby.

1228
01:24:46,152 --> 01:24:49,133
I guess I'm up. Wish me luck.

1229
01:24:54,294 --> 01:24:57,332
This is something that I call
the Tower of Dreamers.

1230
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:12,315
A thousand years ago, the only
people on Earth were monkeys.

1231
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:16,588
And they said,
"We'll never walk erectus.

1232
01:25:16,716 --> 01:25:20,323
We'll never use tools.
We'll never talk."

1233
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:25,493
And then one monkey said: "Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm talking right now."

1234
01:25:25,592 --> 01:25:28,835
That monkey... was a dreamer.

1235
01:25:29,162 --> 01:25:31,335
- Mice dressed as monkeys.
- Yes-

1236
01:25:31,498 --> 01:25:33,842
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

1237
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,014
Fast-forward 500 years.

1238
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:45,687
The Wright Brothers decide
to make themselves a 'Hying machine.

1239
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:51,195
"You fools! You idiots! What's
your problem?" everyone shouted.

1240
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:55,231
"That will never work because
plywood weighs more than air!"

1241
01:25:55,355 --> 01:25:57,801
To which the Wright Brothers
responded:

1242
01:25:58,558 --> 01:26:00,094
"No, it doesn't."

1243
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:03,773
The Wright Brothers were dreamers.

1244
01:26:06,733 --> 01:26:11,443
The Earl of Sandwich
and Sir Francis Bacon.

1245
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:17,146
Had it not been for them, the BLT
would merely be lettuce and tomato.

1246
01:26:20,213 --> 01:26:23,126
They were dreamers.
And sandwich makers.

1247
01:26:24,884 --> 01:26:26,124
It's not over yet.

1248
01:26:27,721 --> 01:26:30,167
Vincent van Gogh.

1249
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:34,238
Everyone told him,
"You only have one ear.

1250
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:36,897
You cannot be a great artist."

1251
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:41,178
And you know what he said?
"l can't hear you."

1252
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:43,247
Vincent van Gogh was a dreamer.

1253
01:26:45,438 --> 01:26:46,746
- I love to paint.
- Really?

1254
01:26:46,906 --> 01:26:48,852
- I love to paint.
- Are you any good?

1255
01:26:49,175 --> 01:26:51,781
- I don't know.
- Of course not.

1256
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:57,456
Louis Pasteur turned
cheese into medicine.

1257
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:09,933
Benjamin Franklin.

1258
01:27:10,263 --> 01:27:13,836
People said,
"You can't fly a kite in a rainstorm."

1259
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:19,617
And Ben Franklin said, "Yes, you can,
if you have an electric kite."

1260
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:26,354
Little detail with the kite.
That's good, ja?

1261
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:29,824
A man who broke more bones...

1262
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,823
...than any man in history:

1263
01:27:35,722 --> 01:27:36,826
Eve! Knievel.

1264
01:27:43,496 --> 01:27:44,736
It's fantastic.

1265
01:27:44,864 --> 01:27:46,901
Well played, rookie. Well played.

1266
01:27:47,233 --> 01:27:51,511
And who might this
handsome young lad be?

1267
01:27:52,405 --> 01:27:53,713
Tim Conrad.

1268
01:27:55,141 --> 01:27:59,590
He believes that someday he
will marry the girl of his dreams,

1269
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:02,990
even though every time
he asks, she says no.

1270
01:28:03,316 --> 01:28:06,820
And even though, as we speak,
she is probably having sex

1271
01:28:06,986 --> 01:28:12,834
with a handsome artist.
Tim Conrad... is a dreamer.

1272
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,275
So dare to dream.
Dream your wildest dreams.

1273
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:26,907
You can climb the highest mountain.

1274
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:31,916
You can drown in a teacup,
if you ind a big enough teacup.

1275
01:28:32,045 --> 01:28:35,458
And if somebody tells you
that you can't do something,

1276
01:28:35,582 --> 01:28:38,859
you say, "Yes, I can.

1277
01:28:39,018 --> 01:28:41,965
'Cause I'm doing it right now!"

1278
01:28:46,526 --> 01:28:48,369
Bravo!

1279
01:28:48,461 --> 01:28:49,872
Bravo, Sir!

1280
01:28:55,135 --> 01:28:57,741
You must come to Switzerland.
You'll be the toast of Zurich!

1281
01:28:58,571 --> 01:29:01,074
I can't understand your accent!

1282
01:29:03,777 --> 01:29:08,920
- Caldwell. This guy's taking it.
- The night is young.

1283
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:14,589
Gentlemen, ladies, I'd like to
introduce you to Mr. Therman Murch,

1284
01:29:14,721 --> 01:29:18,567
IRS auditor and master
of mind control.

1285
01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:20,228
Therman?

1286
01:29:25,899 --> 01:29:27,401
Sorry for my tardiness.

1287
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:30,070
Mr. Murch came by
the office last night.

1288
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:31,911
Shame to hear about that audit, Tim.

1289
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:34,278
Anything I can do to help,
I'm here for you.

1290
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:37,120
Barry, what are you doing here?

1291
01:29:38,244 --> 01:29:39,018
I dunno.

1292
01:29:39,345 --> 01:29:43,350
- You two know each other?
- Yes. We work together.

1293
01:29:44,617 --> 01:29:46,654
I'm gonna have to get
the address of that office.

1294
01:29:47,253 --> 01:29:50,757
So Therman was telling me about some
of his techniques for mind control,

1295
01:29:50,857 --> 01:29:53,303
and I gotta say,
I was pretty blown away.

1296
01:29:55,094 --> 01:29:59,941
Yes. The brain has pressure points,
just like any other muscle.

1297
01:30:00,033 --> 01:30:01,774
Apply those pressure points,

1298
01:30:01,935 --> 01:30:06,042
and the brain will
obey your every command.

1299
01:30:06,372 --> 01:30:08,477
Allow me to demonstrate.

1300
01:30:09,509 --> 01:30:10,715
Barry!

1301
01:30:13,112 --> 01:30:14,352
Barry.

1302
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:18,353
Look into my eyes, Barry.

1303
01:30:19,953 --> 01:30:21,193
Barry!

1304
01:30:23,122 --> 01:30:25,227
Where is your wife, Barry?

1305
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,670
Tell us. Where is she?
Come on, Barry, tell us.

1306
01:30:31,798 --> 01:30:37,248
- Your house?
- Yes.

1307
01:30:43,309 --> 01:30:48,884
Let me just get this straight, Barry.
Your wife left you for him?

1308
01:30:51,084 --> 01:30:54,065
She has extraordinary taste in men.

1309
01:30:57,423 --> 01:31:02,372
And, tell us, Barry...
why did your wife leave you?

1310
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:11,175
- Spit it out of your mouth.
- No.

1311
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:12,944
- Say it!
- No.

1312
01:31:13,706 --> 01:31:15,014
Say it, boy!

1313
01:31:18,511 --> 01:31:20,354
I lost her clitoris.

1314
01:31:22,682 --> 01:31:27,529
- That's right.
- You lost her clitoris?

1315
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,531
She got mad because I couldn't End it.

1316
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:33,034
- Well, you know.
- I said, "it's probably in your purse,"

1317
01:31:33,126 --> 01:31:35,197
because nine times out of ten
when she loses something,

1318
01:31:35,528 --> 01:31:36,871
that's where they end up.

1319
01:31:36,963 --> 01:31:39,204
Barry, do you even
know what that is?

1320
01:31:39,532 --> 01:31:41,808
I don't know what half
the stuff in her purse is.

1321
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:45,473
Well, don't worry, Barry. I found it.

1322
01:31:45,605 --> 01:31:46,811
It was in her purse.

1323
01:31:48,207 --> 01:31:49,914
It was in her naughty purse.

1324
01:31:50,043 --> 01:31:54,116
Well, I mean, thank God
somebody found it, right?

1325
01:31:56,049 --> 01:31:59,929
I thought I found it under the couch.

1326
01:32:00,053 --> 01:32:02,761
Turns out it was just an
old piece of chewing gum.

1327
01:32:19,105 --> 01:32:20,413
I release you!

1328
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:26,920
Ladies and gentlemen, mind control.

1329
01:32:27,013 --> 01:32:28,856
Bravo.

1330
01:32:28,982 --> 01:32:32,486
Bravo! Bravo!

1331
01:32:36,589 --> 01:32:37,659
That was sweet.

1332
01:32:41,027 --> 01:32:45,100
Barry, you're better than him.
Martha may not see it, but I do.

1333
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:48,873
Thanks. Thank you, Tim.
You're a good friend.

1334
01:32:49,769 --> 01:32:51,840
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

1335
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:57,182
I'm not. Barry, this... Man, this...

1336
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:59,620
This dinner isn't what you think it is.

1337
01:33:01,447 --> 01:33:02,892
What?

1338
01:33:03,016 --> 01:33:05,155
We invited you all here
to make fun of you.

1339
01:33:07,553 --> 01:33:10,898
So you invite a bunch of
incredibly talented people to dinner

1340
01:33:11,024 --> 01:33:15,996
- and you make fun of them?
- No. it's a dinner for idiots.

1341
01:33:17,697 --> 01:33:20,041
Well, you'd better go ind some idiots.

1342
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:21,974
We do.

1343
01:33:23,302 --> 01:33:28,149
I'm sorry. I...
Really, I'm so sorry.

1344
01:33:29,976 --> 01:33:34,322
If it's any consolation,
Therman will probably win first prize.

1345
01:33:38,518 --> 01:33:39,997
He'll have that, too.

1346
01:33:40,086 --> 01:33:43,329
And he'll be able to lord it
over me for the rest of my life.

1347
01:33:43,656 --> 01:33:46,660
Barry, Erst prize
is the biggest idiot.

1348
01:33:46,826 --> 01:33:51,707
I know. That guy beats me
at everything. He just...

1349
01:33:51,831 --> 01:33:56,007
I don't know, what's the use?
He has mind control, I don't.

1350
01:33:59,338 --> 01:34:01,113
Barry, look at me.

1351
01:34:03,609 --> 01:34:06,351
Therman has mind control, but you...

1352
01:34:07,447 --> 01:34:12,692
- ...you have brain control.
- Brain control? What,,,?

1353
01:34:12,785 --> 01:34:15,026
- You didn't know you had brain control?
- No.

1354
01:34:15,121 --> 01:34:16,794
I knew it the second that I met you.

1355
01:34:16,923 --> 01:34:19,369
You crawled in my brain,
and you stayed there.

1356
01:34:19,459 --> 01:34:21,029
- I did?
- You did.

1357
01:34:21,127 --> 01:34:23,437
And I can't get rid of you,
no matter how hard I try.

1358
01:34:23,563 --> 01:34:28,137
You burrowed your way into my brain,
through my ear, like an earwig!

1359
01:34:28,267 --> 01:34:31,043
- I didn't mean to.
- it's like you set up camp,

1360
01:34:31,204 --> 01:34:34,310
- and I can't get you out of my head!
- I'm an earwig?

1361
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,421
Ifs like teeth and spikes and...

1362
01:34:37,543 --> 01:34:42,390
...all your... spilling out millions
of earwig eggs all in my brain!

1363
01:34:42,548 --> 01:34:44,994
- I can't do anything about it!
- Oh, my God!

1364
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:47,098
Brain control beats mind control
any day of the week!

1365
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,723
Because the brain
tells the mind what to do!

1366
01:34:50,289 --> 01:34:54,101
You can beat this guy.
You can beat this guy, Barry.

1367
01:34:54,894 --> 01:34:58,398
Barry, you can beat Therman.

1368
01:34:58,498 --> 01:35:00,307
"You may say I'm a dreamer..."

1369
01:35:02,235 --> 01:35:04,977
"But I'm not the only one..."

1370
01:35:12,778 --> 01:35:15,088
I'm going to go lay eggs in his brain.

1371
01:35:19,418 --> 01:35:23,457
- Back for more, Barry?
- Yes! I am, Therman.

1372
01:35:23,589 --> 01:35:27,503
Only this time, I brought
my secret weapon... my brain.

1373
01:35:30,096 --> 01:35:34,101
- What are you talking about?
- He's talking about brain control.

1374
01:35:37,603 --> 01:35:41,380
Brain control? There ain't
no such thing as brain control.

1375
01:35:41,507 --> 01:35:45,284
There is mind control.
Brain control is ridiculous.

1376
01:35:45,378 --> 01:35:46,857
That's ridiculous.

1377
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:49,526
Yes, it's ridiculous.

1378
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:52,220
- That's ridiculous.
- Barry.

1379
01:35:52,351 --> 01:35:53,352
Barry.

1380
01:35:54,687 --> 01:36:00,228
- Barry.
- Barry.

1381
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:03,306
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

1382
01:36:03,462 --> 01:36:07,000
- It works.
- How are you doing that?

1383
01:36:07,133 --> 01:36:09,841
I am making you say
everything that I say.

1384
01:36:09,969 --> 01:36:11,346
Yeah, but I'm saying it first.

1385
01:36:12,004 --> 01:36:13,312
- Are you?
- Yes!

1386
01:36:13,406 --> 01:36:14,407
Really?

1387
01:36:15,808 --> 01:36:18,345
I am very, very powerful.

1388
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,020
Oh, my gosh.

1389
01:36:39,865 --> 01:36:41,276
- Oh, thank you,
- You're welcome.

1390
01:36:44,837 --> 01:36:45,838
Oh, no!

1391
01:36:58,851 --> 01:37:01,024
Best dinner ever.

1392
01:37:01,187 --> 01:37:03,531
You have no secrets from me.

1393
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:07,193
Oh, contrary. You have
no secrets from me, Therman.

1394
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:11,866
I know that, after sex, you like
to curl up in the fecal position.

1395
01:37:13,532 --> 01:37:16,376
You cry like a little baby.

1396
01:37:16,535 --> 01:37:19,072
- Martha told you.
- No, she did not.

1397
01:37:19,205 --> 01:37:24,052
I know that you take a magic marker
and you draw a face on your penis.

1398
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:26,588
Is that against the law?
I don't think so.

1399
01:37:26,712 --> 01:37:30,489
And you put a little hat on it,
and you call it Sammy.

1400
01:37:30,616 --> 01:37:32,562
Nobody is supposed to know that.

1401
01:37:32,885 --> 01:37:35,923
- And you sing to it.
- You keep your mouth shut!

1402
01:37:41,927 --> 01:37:44,430
That's... That's not 100 percent true.

1403
01:37:44,563 --> 01:37:49,444
I know everything!
I have laid eggs inside of your brain.

1404
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,514
Get them out of my head!

1405
01:37:51,837 --> 01:37:55,410
You are no longer in control
of me! I control you!

1406
01:37:55,574 --> 01:38:00,580
And you are under my power.
I know everything, Therman.

1407
01:38:01,814 --> 01:38:02,815
And I release you.

1408
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:11,301
Barry! Barry!

1409
01:38:12,091 --> 01:38:13,161
Yeah!

1410
01:38:14,093 --> 01:38:16,596
I hope that you have
all kept your receipts,

1411
01:38:16,696 --> 01:38:19,176
because you will all be audited.

1412
01:38:22,868 --> 01:38:26,315
He slept with Martha at my house!

1413
01:38:26,439 --> 01:38:29,818
I was under the bed
the whole time. What an idiot!

1414
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:34,614
Right? I know!

1415
01:38:34,947 --> 01:38:37,484
We have a little tradition,
here, at this dinner.

1416
01:38:37,616 --> 01:38:42,031
We give an award to the evening's
most extraordinary person.

1417
01:38:42,154 --> 01:38:46,569
Tonight's winner is the most
extraordinary person I have ever met.

1418
01:38:46,892 --> 01:38:48,530
Our winner:

1419
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:49,867
Barry!

1420
01:38:51,297 --> 01:38:52,799
Yeah!

1421
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:00,075
- We did it!
- Congratulations.

1422
01:39:00,206 --> 01:39:01,207
Thank you.

1423
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:04,480
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Conrad.

1424
01:39:04,577 --> 01:39:08,650
Tim, Tim, you did it.
Your guy is amazing.

1425
01:39:08,748 --> 01:39:10,022
Mueller loves him.

1426
01:39:10,983 --> 01:39:12,656
He is amazing.

1427
01:39:12,818 --> 01:39:14,729
- I thought you did such a great job.
- You're the winner?

1428
01:39:14,854 --> 01:39:16,424
- I am, yeah!
- Whatever.

1429
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:20,427
And he deserves a hell
of a lot better than this.

1430
01:39:20,559 --> 01:39:24,200
- They all do.
- What do you mean, exactly?

1431
01:39:25,197 --> 01:39:29,339
Any one of you would throw me
under the bus for a bigger bonus.

1432
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:33,279
And Barry would throw himself
in front of a car to save a mouse...

1433
01:39:33,406 --> 01:39:35,044
...even though it was already dead.

1434
01:39:36,342 --> 01:39:39,221
I have been trying
to play on your team.

1435
01:39:39,345 --> 01:39:42,622
Barry doesn't deserve that trophy. I do.

1436
01:39:42,948 --> 01:39:45,929
Hold on a second.
Tim, I won this trophy fair and square.

1437
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:47,530
Barry, you don't want that trophy.

1438
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:50,100
- I've never won a trophy before.
-Yeah, I know, but...

1439
01:39:50,222 --> 01:39:51,724
- You know what? Keep the trophy.
- OK.

1440
01:39:51,857 --> 01:39:53,427
I'm sorry, What's going on here?

1441
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:57,200
Well, these people invited us here
to make fun of us.

1442
01:39:57,296 --> 01:40:00,209
This is a contest for the biggest idiot.

1443
01:40:00,366 --> 01:40:01,868
Which I nailed!

1444
01:40:03,035 --> 01:40:04,708
Wait, wait, wait...

1445
01:40:04,804 --> 01:40:07,045
-You told him?
-I did.

1446
01:40:07,206 --> 01:40:10,085
It seems this contest was fixed.

1447
01:40:10,209 --> 01:40:12,621
I thought you conducted
yourselves honorably.

1448
01:40:12,745 --> 01:40:15,055
No, we do. We do.

1449
01:40:15,147 --> 01:40:18,617
We do. Tim had a very
bright future here,

1450
01:40:18,951 --> 01:40:22,398
but for some reason, he's chosen
to throw his lot in with the losers.

1451
01:40:22,555 --> 01:40:25,502
Excuse me? I think I must
not have heard correctly.

1452
01:40:25,624 --> 01:40:28,264
- Did he call us losers?
- He did.

1453
01:40:28,961 --> 01:40:32,670
You insult my honor at great risk.
I will be leaving.

1454
01:40:32,798 --> 01:40:35,745
Count yourself lucky
I have spared your life.

1455
01:40:35,901 --> 01:40:37,244
Yeah!

1456
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:43,743
- Marco!
- Oh, God.

1457
01:40:44,076 --> 01:40:47,614
So it is a tight you want, is it?
Well, you shall have your fight.

1458
01:40:47,746 --> 01:40:49,248
But on my terms.

1459
01:40:55,087 --> 01:40:59,263
In a world of complete darkness,
the sighted are blind...

1460
01:40:59,358 --> 01:41:01,838
...but the blind can see.

1461
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,831
Oh, God.

1462
01:41:06,932 --> 01:41:10,209
Welcome... to my world.

1463
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,383
I am invisible. Where am I?

1464
01:41:14,507 --> 01:41:17,511
- He's good.
- I am a shadow...

1465
01:41:17,643 --> 01:41:18,644
...with a big knife!

1466
01:41:20,679 --> 01:41:23,523
- Simmer down!
- I can smell your fear!

1467
01:41:24,717 --> 01:41:26,219
I think he's gonna kill someone.

1468
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,392
Over here!

1469
01:41:29,522 --> 01:41:31,399
Hey, no! Not the boys!

1470
01:41:31,524 --> 01:41:33,299
This has become a fiasco!

1471
01:41:33,392 --> 01:41:35,497
Wait a second... the Swedish guy
who thinks he's a German!

1472
01:41:35,628 --> 01:41:37,801
He's an idiot, too! Mueller!

1473
01:41:38,797 --> 01:41:40,470
This is what you've
been up to all along!

1474
01:41:40,566 --> 01:41:41,567
NO! NO!

1475
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:43,202
- You brought me hereto make fun!
- No...

1476
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:45,838
I can assure you.
I am no Unterschlagen!

1477
01:41:50,809 --> 01:41:52,811
No, no! Lorenzo, no!

1478
01:41:53,145 --> 01:41:55,386
- Somebody, grab the bird!
- I got it...

1479
01:41:57,917 --> 01:41:59,692
No, no, no!

1480
01:41:59,818 --> 01:42:02,560
It is my wife's favorite finger!
Please get it back now!

1481
01:42:02,688 --> 01:42:05,498
Williams, get the bird!
Somebody kill the bird!

1482
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:07,070
- They're going to kill my bird!
- It's not his time!

1483
01:42:07,192 --> 01:42:09,331
- It's over there!
- Don't hurt him!

1484
01:42:09,428 --> 01:42:11,601
- Get the bird!
- Parry right, thrust left!

1485
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:13,835
You want the bird?
You have to kill me first!

1486
01:42:14,166 --> 01:42:16,339
Fight like a blind man!
Kick him in the business center!

1487
01:42:16,502 --> 01:42:17,674
Right here.

1488
01:42:22,007 --> 01:42:23,680
- There's a Ere!
- Oh, come on!

1489
01:42:23,776 --> 01:42:25,346
Grab the vulture!

1490
01:42:26,345 --> 01:42:29,121
Somebody, just let the bird out!
Please! Just let him out!

1491
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:32,457
- Wait, I have an idea.
- Let Lorenzo out!

1492
01:42:32,585 --> 01:42:35,589
You, stop! Don't move
or I'm gonna kill you.

1493
01:42:36,522 --> 01:42:37,523
Allow me.

1494
01:42:42,928 --> 01:42:44,032
There it is!

1495
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:48,974
Nice!

1496
01:42:52,471 --> 01:42:53,472
Wanna?

1497
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,642
Great dinner!
Let's go get Julie!

1498
01:42:57,876 --> 01:42:59,412
Mein linger!

1499
01:43:02,982 --> 01:43:05,121
Don't you die on me!

1500
01:43:10,255 --> 01:43:13,759
- Juilie! Julie?
- Julie?

1501
01:43:13,892 --> 01:43:15,894
Julie?

1502
01:43:16,562 --> 01:43:17,939
Tim.

1503
01:43:27,306 --> 01:43:29,582
There's a way to read that
that’s actually positive.

1504
01:43:29,742 --> 01:43:32,746
How? How is that positive, Barry?

1505
01:43:34,313 --> 01:43:36,190
"Tim, have a ni..."

1506
01:43:36,315 --> 01:43:37,919
"Hey, Tim, ha..."

1507
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,923
"Have a nice life."

1508
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:47,366
- This is my fault, isn't it?
- It's not. it's my fault.

1509
01:43:47,493 --> 01:43:51,839
I'm the reason this happened. Not you.

1510
01:43:51,964 --> 01:43:55,343
I messed up.
Want to hear something pathetic?

1511
01:43:56,602 --> 01:43:58,206
God, yeah.

1512
01:43:58,337 --> 01:44:00,544
You know why I wanted that promotion?

1513
01:44:00,673 --> 01:44:03,279
So that Julie would think
that I was good enough for her.

1514
01:44:03,976 --> 01:44:08,015
So stupid. I couldn't
believe that someone so amazing

1515
01:44:08,147 --> 01:44:10,491
would want anything to do
with me. I tried to impress her...

1516
01:44:10,616 --> 01:44:13,563
...with stuff she doesn't
care about, I don't care about.

1517
01:44:14,853 --> 01:44:17,800
You know what I care about? Her.

1518
01:44:18,957 --> 01:44:20,493
And what else?

1519
01:44:20,626 --> 01:44:24,301
Waking up next to her every day,
seeing her every day.

1520
01:44:24,463 --> 01:44:25,908
And more things?

1521
01:44:26,231 --> 01:44:30,907
She's the greatest thing in my life,
and I blew it. God, I'm an idiot.

1522
01:44:34,473 --> 01:44:35,645
What are you doing?

1523
01:44:43,816 --> 01:44:45,523
Did you know I was listening?

1524
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:48,860
- No.
- I did. I did.

1525
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,329
I... I thought you'd gone.

1526
01:44:55,728 --> 01:44:58,106
I left my phone.

1527
01:44:59,498 --> 01:45:03,571
- Julie... I'm...
- Julie?

1528
01:45:06,171 --> 01:45:08,515
We should hurry if we're
gonna catch that plane.

1529
01:45:10,576 --> 01:45:14,217
- Kieran...
- Julie, I will handle this.

1530
01:45:16,849 --> 01:45:20,296
Kieran... since the dawn
of ancient times,

1531
01:45:20,419 --> 01:45:23,764
men and women have striven
to End the perfect mate.

1532
01:45:23,889 --> 01:45:26,563
And, once in a while,
a couple will meet

1533
01:45:26,692 --> 01:45:29,468
and spark a passion
that is so powerful,

1534
01:45:29,595 --> 01:45:33,543
a thousand armies
could not pull them apart.

1535
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:35,872
That is what you have with Julie.

1536
01:45:36,702 --> 01:45:38,477
But Tim got there first.

1537
01:45:38,604 --> 01:45:40,982
And if Julie leaves, ii will kill him.

1538
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:44,887
People can die of broken hearts.

1539
01:45:45,043 --> 01:45:47,546
I know. It almost happened to me.

1540
01:45:48,313 --> 01:45:53,786
And because of that...
you may see Julie no more.

1541
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:57,760
You may talk to Julie no more.

1542
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:03,067
You may look upon
Julie's face... no more.

1543
01:46:03,162 --> 01:46:05,938
OK, but we work together, so...

1544
01:46:06,064 --> 01:46:08,510
What part of "no more"
do you not understand?

1545
01:46:08,634 --> 01:46:09,942
We had a talk, Kieran and I,

1546
01:46:10,068 --> 01:46:12,912
and he understands
it's purely professional.

1547
01:46:13,071 --> 01:46:17,315
- There is professional no more.
- He's right, Julie.

1548
01:46:18,744 --> 01:46:23,853
If we start this tire...
we'll burn this world to ashes.

1549
01:46:23,982 --> 01:46:28,021
- What are you talking about?
- If you start this Ere...

1550
01:46:30,255 --> 01:46:33,259
- Burn it to ashes.
- ...burn this world to ashes.

1551
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:38,799
- There goes my museum show.
- Welcome to my world.

1552
01:46:38,931 --> 01:46:42,435
- Yeah.
- Julie...

1553
01:46:42,534 --> 01:46:46,311
...I love you. I don't care
if we get married. I'll stop asking.

1554
01:46:48,106 --> 01:46:49,642
Don't stop asking.

1555
01:47:04,456 --> 01:47:08,836
- You are a wise man, my friend.
- As are you.

1556
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:20,974
Au revoir Julie.
Au revoir Tim.

1557
01:47:21,139 --> 01:47:22,880
Au revoir Kieran.

1558
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:28,516
Be kind to your birds and your goats!

1559
01:47:42,995 --> 01:47:45,168
We're gonna be so happy together!

1560
01:47:53,272 --> 01:47:56,515
I guess things
really do happen for a reason.

1561
01:47:56,675 --> 01:47:59,178
Tim lost his job, but the
two of us remain best friends.

1562
01:47:59,511 --> 01:48:03,687
And once a month, I invite him
to a gathering I hast.

1563
01:48:03,782 --> 01:48:07,127
It's called The Breakfast of Champions.

1564
01:48:08,887 --> 01:48:10,867
Kieran and I became friends.

1565
01:48:11,023 --> 01:48:12,627
He asked me to collaborate with him,

1566
01:48:12,758 --> 01:48:15,068
and we showed our work
ah' over the world...

1567
01:48:15,193 --> 01:48:17,639
...including South Africa.

1568
01:48:17,763 --> 01:48:19,800
And guess who came to see us?

1569
01:48:19,932 --> 01:48:21,536
Morgan Freeman.

1570
01:48:24,903 --> 01:48:28,214
Tim went on to help Martin Mueller
convert his munitions factory

1571
01:48:28,307 --> 01:48:30,719
into the Martin Mueller
Museum of Modem Art...

1572
01:48:30,876 --> 01:48:31,946
...or

1573
01:48:35,213 --> 01:48:38,319
Kieran and I collaborated
on a sculpture for the opening.

1574
01:48:44,089 --> 01:48:47,901
I met up with Darla again.
Boy, does she like role playing.

1575
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:51,667
She had me play detective,
and she left all of these clues.

1576
01:48:51,797 --> 01:48:53,003
And you know what?

1577
01:48:53,899 --> 01:48:55,503
I found it.

1578
01:48:58,904 --> 01:49:00,781
Therman wrote a new book.

1579
01:49:00,906 --> 01:49:03,512
And it is very popular in some circles.

1580
01:49:05,077 --> 01:49:09,321
I guess it's true what they say...
"A mind is a terrible thing. "

1581
01:49:13,618 --> 01:49:18,089
Oh, yeah, as for Tim and Julie...
Well, Julie finally said yes.

1582
01:49:18,256 --> 01:49:20,600
They went to Paris for the honeymoon.

1583
01:49:20,692 --> 01:49:24,765
I waited around to surprise them,
but it never felt like the right time.

1584
01:49:26,198 --> 01:49:28,269
Anyway, i can tell you this:

1585
01:49:28,834 --> 01:49:31,178
They both got curated..

1586
01:49:31,303 --> 01:49:32,611
...several times.

1587
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,173
Oh, yeah... Fenders company
went out of business.

1588
01:53:25,337 --> 01:53:29,046
Forbes Magazine named him
Wall Streets biggest loser!

1589
01:53:29,174 --> 01:53:31,381
Way to go, Fender!
