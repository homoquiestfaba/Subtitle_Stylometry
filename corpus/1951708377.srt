1
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:29,867
This story my story is a confession.

2
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,840
Lucky for you, they're the hottest of all stories.

3
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,550
Ask any priest.

4
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:37,507
He might tell you to watch and learn from my sins.

5
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:41,027
Or maybe you'd rather sit back and wait for the dirty parts.

6
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:42,879
Be my guest.

7
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:47,685
I'm not Catholic, but I've met enough priests

8
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,452
to know one thing about confessions:

9
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,686
they're always anonymous.

10
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:56,389
So in the spirit of anonymity, call me X

11
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:07,802
All this drama started about a year ago.

12
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,114
I'm on my way to work. Not looking for anything.

13
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,443
Honestly, you don't know me yet.

14
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,363
To the average transit rider it appears

15
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:34,665
I'm cruising a random hottie.

16
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:36,866
But this is no random hottie.

17
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,793
He was in my Abnormal Psych class back at U. W.

18
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,777
Thing is, I hadn't found him remotely arousing in school.

19
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:45,387
But now Blondie looked different.

20
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:47,657
Actually, he looked the same,

21
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,367
I just looked at him differently.

22
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:52,277
I was feeling something I hadn't felt since seventh grade.

23
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:57,714
Forgive me Father, I felt lustful.

24
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,793
Don't worry, this doesn't end with me in his beefy arms--

25
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,962
although I do spend a few choice moments in them.

26
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,935
This isn't really about him at all.

27
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,339
It's about me.

28
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:14,467
And

29
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:16,135
And I'm late for work.

30
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:18,305
If you're smart you've guessed I'm a hustler.

31
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,281
If you haven't, here are two clues:

32
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,476
I'm gay and they made a movie about me.

33
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,182
Try to keep up.

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,897
I'm not your typical picture-in-the-back-of-the

35
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,184
fag-rag hustler.

36
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:30,122
I work by referral only.

37
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,750
And I charge a lot.

38
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,761
Supposedly I'm worth it.

39
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,662
I keep my client list to a trim twelve regulars

40
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,257
who have the resources to accommodate my lifestyle.

41
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,030
I think of them as my disciples.

42
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,365
There's The Judge

43
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:43,405
Mr. Jowls

44
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:44,166
Chaps

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,002
Daddy's Boy

46
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:45,904
Gin Martini

47
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:46,805
The Accoun tant

48
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,740
Father of Six. . .

49
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,708
The Mummy. . .

50
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:49,676
Screamer. . .

51
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:50,473
Bruce Lee. . .

52
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,342
Breath Mints. . .

53
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:52,881
and Barely Breathing.

54
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,316
Unfortunately for me, Barely Breathing

55
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,446
stopped breathing last week.

56
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,185
It wasn't even natural causes like you'd think.

57
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,492
So, lucky for Gregory, that leaves an opening.

58
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,516
He's supposed to be some old recluse.

59
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,548
A geezer.

60
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:15,968
That'll be his name.

61
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,266
Geezer.

62
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,654
The old gays depress me sometimes.

63
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,268
Not because l'm getting old myself,

64
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,040
but because of the shit they had to go through

65
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,604
to get where they are.

66
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:28,547
Which is often nowhere.

67
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:31,884
You must be X.

68
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:35,042
Of course at the time he used my real name.

69
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,256
Well, my real hustler name.

70
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,725
Anyway this is just for the movie.

71
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,126
To protect the innocent.

72
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,687
Thanks for saving me from an afternoon

73
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,180
of Judge Judy.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,571
Great view.

75
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,269
When the University bought the building, only a few

76
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,692
of the original tenants stayed .

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,838
The smart ones .

78
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:00,818
The rich ones .

79
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,650
I think I like this one.

80
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:06,120
My sense of humor and kind a hot.

81
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,582
For seventy-nine.

82
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,347
I graduated from here.

83
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:14,823
Ah, I've often wondered what became of our illustrious alumni

84
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,511
I'm not sure I'm typical .

85
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,232
I suspect not.

86
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,203
I wasn't sure what you'd want.

87
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,435
Water's all I need .

88
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,838
Only accept drinks that are factory sealed.

89
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,408
Tell me about your life.

90
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,109
I want to know the course our romance will take.

91
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:41,996
Romance?

92
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,777
He objects to the term romance

93
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,088
Probably doesn't kiss .

94
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,819
Very Klute.

95
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:51,795
Surely a lad of your experience--

96
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,732
what are you, thirty?

97
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,202
Twenty-five.

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,435
Well, surely you realize no real sex is possible

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,686
without some degree of romance.

100
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,094
We'll see.

101
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,539
A man who knows the price of everything

102
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,103
and the value of nothing

103
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,745
Thank you, Oscar Wilde.

104
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:14,353
Bet that surprised you too, cute and smart.

105
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:17,328
But he's a whore, there must be something wrong with him

106
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:18,315
Eat me.

107
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,813
Do you enjoy chocolate?

108
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:26,742
These range from fifty to ninety percent purity.

109
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:31,903
The ninety is too intense for words .

110
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:36,779
You've never been in love?

111
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,071
Unless you count my cousin when I was twelve.

112
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,250
That counts.

113
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:44,097
I still remember when I first told a man I loved him .

114
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,710
I can imagine.

115
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:52,389
Look, it's cool chatting, but it's in your

116
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:55,589
best interest to let me know what you'd like to do .

117
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:58,155
A visit usually takes an hour.

118
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,107
An hour?

119
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,071
Hardly worth showering .

120
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:26,625
Patience, my boy.

121
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,963
Our time will come.

122
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:37,162
But not until you desire me as much as I desire you .

123
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,404
Never had a check bounce, never been stiffed.

124
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,712
Normally I don't take the let's just talk clients.

125
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,305
They're the ones who get clingy.

126
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:51,185
Who act like they own you and get all Jeffrey Dahmer.

127
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,287
I prefer to fuck their brains out,

128
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,040
take my money and split.

129
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:57,748
But there was something interesting about Gregory,

130
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,589
besides the size of his check.

131
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:02,297
As much cash as I bring in,

132
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,355
I still have two roommates because--

133
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:08,835
Who's that?

134
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,192
Joey? !

135
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:19,106
Andrew?

136
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:20,976
That was yours?!

137
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,194
Andrew.

138
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,431
That's who this is really about.

139
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,944
I'm not normally into black guys,

140
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,786
but Andrew's hotter than the seventh plane of hell.

141
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:33,294
I could tell he wanted me a little

142
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,694
But we'd lived together a year now,

143
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:38,678
and nothing more than an occasional flirt passed between us.

144
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:44,046
Okay maybe he didn't want me but --

145
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:46,490
I'm obsessing over my roommate.

146
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:49,069
But Andrew's like, boyfriend material.

147
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,135
Not for me of course, but for somebody.

148
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,500
Who was he?

149
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,088
What's that?

150
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:57,583
It's Jill

151
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,511
She's

152
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,116
Jill was his evil ex-fiancee.

153
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,192
I only thought she was evil because she'd done him

154
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,259
and I
I hadn't.

155
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,823
Was the bitch dead?

156
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:08,847
Is she dead?

157
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:10,861
Jesus ! No !

158
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:13,722
She's getting married .

159
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,576
You should a seen your face.

160
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:23,368
I was just being aghast out of respect.

161
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,938
So what happened with the smoked ham back there?

162
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:30,663
Nothing

163
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,384
Right

164
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,760
Seriously, I got the letter and kind a got out ta the mood .

165
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,400
You were in the mood?

166
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,927
We met on the bus, he offered .

167
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:41,730
He's totally hot. Why not?

168
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,122
In the year he lived here, Andrew only hooked up with one guy

169
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:47,530
and they just jacked off so it did n't really count.

170
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:50,316
Because you're not a slut.

171
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,105
I thought that was one of Joey's .

172
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,868
Maybe I was horny.

173
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,075
Why should it matter to you?

174
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,458
I hate you.

175
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:02,141
I guess I gave you more credit than you deserved .

176
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,050
Oh, that's priceless coming from you

177
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,171
And thereinlies my problem folks.

178
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,256
A hustler with morals.

179
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,586
A whore who is not a slut.

180
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:15,409
Outside of work, I haven't had sex, mutual masturbation

181
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:16,988
or otherwise since I was twelve.

182
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,248
And that was only once.

183
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,698
Sometimes I consider myself a virgin, since I was

184
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,348
a minor when it happened.

185
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:25,436
In school I knew three Mormon girls who swore any

186
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,498
activity on the planet that didn't involve breaking

187
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,771
their hymens left them virgins.

188
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,874
Why haven't I had sex?

189
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,073
I'm saving myself for someone I love.

190
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,031
Okay.

191
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:38,915
Let's play the X-is-a-prostitute game.

192
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,477
Nothing I say means anything because

193
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm just a prostitute.

194
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,352
I don't need a hooker calling me a slut.

195
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,021
If you guys don't fuck soon, I'm going to slit my wrists !

196
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,640
And Joey makes the family complete.

197
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,595
We met a year ago when my accountant suggested

198
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,501
I get roommates to keep the IRS off my back.

199
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,836
Joey was the first to respond.

200
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:00,598
17, no job, homeless.

201
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,434
But he had a GED, so he wasn't a total loser.

202
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,944
He comes in and asks to live ren't-free.

203
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,038
I agreed.

204
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,674
Shit, I'm only human.

205
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,684
He's hit on me every day since.

206
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:15,245
My speech impediment is because of my extra long tongue.

207
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,922
But he is so not right for me

208
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,552
in so many ways.

209
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:23,393
I mean first off until last week he was a minor.

210
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:25,142
You're worse than all of my parents,

211
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:26,219
but not as old .

212
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,295
Okay guys, check this out!

213
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,769
Out to my room !

214
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,104
See the guy outside the cafe?

215
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,873
He's way cute up close.

216
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,676
It's Scooter.

217
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:40,741
The Scooter?

218
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:41,488
Yeah

219
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:43,117
He just started there.

220
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,319
Who's Scooter?

221
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:45,269
My back-up plan .

222
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,747
The boy Joey ruined

223
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,315
The only guy who's ever loved me.

224
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,722
Like truly

225
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,881
Joey was too chicken to actually break up with him

226
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,227
So I cheated on him to get him to break up with me.

227
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,491
He kept forgiving me so I just stopped calling him .

228
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:57,384
That's cruel .

229
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,125
Whatever, I'm your back-up plan .

230
00:10:59,201 --> 00:10:59,957
Admit it.

231
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:01,789
I don't have a back-up plan .

232
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,786
Every one has a back-up plan .

233
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:04,813
Who's yours?

234
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:07,636
I guess it was Jill

235
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,399
Baby let me loosen those weary old bones

236
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:14,196
I'm sure his bones are plenty loose already.

237
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,443
What were you guys moaning about?

238
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,381
Nothing

239
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:19,113
X got pissy with me because I brought a guy home.

240
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:21,559
You brought a guy home?

241
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,707
Like a trick?

242
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,723
Why is it so shocking that I could have a trick?

243
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:28,092
It's not that it's congratulations !

244
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:29,960
You're a stage two fag !

245
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:31,067
What?

246
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:32,727
You were stage one for like a year.

247
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:35,031
You first come out and think you're not gonna be slutty

248
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:37,678
so you can find this perfect boyfriend who's also not slutty.

249
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:39,764
That's when I met Scooter.

250
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:40,830
Eighth grade.

251
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,542
He's not kidding

252
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,746
But now, you're stage two .

253
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:44,946
Have fun .

254
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,277
See a hot guy, screw around .

255
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:48,646
I don't know if I'd go that far

256
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,449
but maybe I'm transitioning .

257
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,619
So what's the next stage?

258
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,836
It's like

259
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:58,682
thirty.Old age.

260
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:02,689
Don't worry. Some of us dig older men .

261
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:08,944
So,now that I'm getting into my sexually adventurous stage.

262
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:11,897
We'll have to stock up on shampoo for the crabs .

263
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,914
Don't be such a dick pump .

264
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,339
Maybe I don't like seeing my friends

265
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,775
throw away their morals .

266
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,473
I've always been slutty and you don't hold it against me.

267
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,794
That's because I have different standards for you .

268
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:35,863
You are an asshole.

269
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,173
So you've met my nuclear reactor family.

270
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,929
Three hot studs, horny for each other,

271
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,435
living in one apartment.

272
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,475
Like a bad porno only without the sex.

273
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,347
If you're waiting for my sensitive fag hag,

274
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,703
don't hold your breath.

275
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:59,284
Lucy's too much of a like to hag for anyone,

276
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:00,480
fag or otherwise.

277
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,352
I never say much to her, but she has a knack

278
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:07,019
for reading my mind.

279
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,539
She's pretty much the only woman in my life.

280
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:11,725
It's not a sexism thing, the only thing I have

281
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,098
against women is that men aren't more like them.

282
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,261
How'd it go with Gregory?

283
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,008
I knew this would work out.

284
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:24,044
I'm so glad you needed a new john .

285
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,672
Ever since she figured out what I do, it's been like

286
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:29,717
a spy game she's been dying to get involved with.

287
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:31,885
You know, he never leaves that place.

288
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,979
He's ordered lunch delivered from us for like six years

289
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,713
What's he into?

290
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,287
I knew it.

291
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,331
Total bore.

292
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:45,593
I bet he just sits and talks

293
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,296
Probably doesn't even want to fuck.

294
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:50,428
Just gets his jollies by imagining being you .

295
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,167
A busybody, but she's always right on.

296
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,766
Remember I've probably said like fifteen sentences

297
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:57,209
to her since we met.

298
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:00,094
Fuckin'customers

299
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:01,888
Can't wait to hear more, babe.

300
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:28,741
There is one other woman in my life.

301
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,404
I'm not really religious but this particular virgin

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,971
has a somewhat cunty expression like

303
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:37,143
she's demanding a child support check from God.

304
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,743
She inspires me.

305
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,845
I spotted her cruising me at a book store and

306
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,890
convinced the assistant manager to sell her to me

307
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,550
for two hundred bucks.

308
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,603
What was the artist feeling as he painted her face?

309
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,743
Daring to know the mother of God.

310
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:55,372
I look at her and my soul slips into her left nipple.

311
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,528
Virgin becomes whore. God becomes slave.

312
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,643
Fantasies never make sense.

313
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:03,877
I understand what it is to be a gay man.

314
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,603
That's his third trick this week.

315
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:30,829
But who's counting?

316
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,748
God, I feel like Joey.

317
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:36,901
Exposed and rejected.

318
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:52,254
My hand is never confused over how it feels about me.

319
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,642
I feel omnipotent that I can give myself such pleasure.

320
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,024
When I cum I throw my head back hard.

321
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,669
Two seconds later I feel content.

322
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:04,828
Then wasted.

323
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:05,870
Then morose.

324
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:12,573
The orgasm is a trap but masturbation is bliss.

325
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,725
I even masturbate after a trick.

326
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,974
It's an eraser.

327
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:24,214
As you may have gathered I'm a touch antisocial.

328
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:30,635
Boy Kultur is the only gay club I've been to more than once.

329
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,078
They let me in free because Joey used to fuck the doorman

330
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:52,553
It's not a scary leather den tweaker cave or guppy aquarium

331
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,987
but all those types sort of fit in.

332
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:59,287
Anything goes at Boy Kultur, which is rare

333
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,125
in our Neapolitan gay community where every flavor

334
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:03,821
is separate but equal.

335
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,396
So what do I do at Boy Kultur?

336
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:14,767
Sit mostly.

337
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,308
Thinking sometimes, but mostly sitting.

338
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:22,611
I always claim the stool next door so no one

339
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:24,948
gets the crazy idea I'm available

340
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,591
I like watching the playful dance

341
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,390
of the cruise and pick up.

342
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:36,555
A mating ritual more elaborate than anything

343
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,232
on the Discovery Channel.

344
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:42,262
Why do guys pass themselves around so freely?

345
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:45,363
I mean, I have a lot of sex but only if I'm being paid.

346
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,340
I get something in return.

347
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,741
You may think that's the lowest of low,

348
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:52,678
but isn't it better than spreading for any smooth operator

349
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:55,174
for a Bud Light and cab fare?

350
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,478
Maybe it comes down to pleasure.

351
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:58,917
But do they get that much pleasure

352
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,318
from all these hook-ups ?

353
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,879
There's so much energy put into cruising,

354
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:04,924
socialization

355
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,491
fashion

356
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:07,926
months at the gym

357
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:09,987
Myoplex shakes.

358
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,090
finally you get laid

359
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,438
and never hear from the fucker again.

360
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,902
Then you invest all your energy and money back into

361
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,742
grooming working out, making yourself perfect again

362
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,405
for the next lay

363
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,077
If gay guys stopped spending so much time hooking up,

364
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:33,677
we'd have fucking da Vincis everywhere.

365
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,280
Mind if I sit here?

366
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,685
Shit.

367
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,188
Fight or flight?

368
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,649
Boy, you look lost in thought.

369
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,963
No, I'm just trying to have a moment here.

370
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,263
I'm not looking for anything sleazy.

371
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:48,746
Unless you are.

372
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,309
What exactly do you think makes you so hot?

373
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:58,778
What do you have that a million guys just like you don't?

374
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:00,979
So what makes you so hot?

375
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,983
I don't know, why don't you tell me?

376
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,411
Game-playing asshole.

377
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,791
What, you were expecting a heart of gold?

378
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,591
Forgive me Father, I was selfish.

379
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:44,421
I couldn't decide whether to hop in

380
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:47,080
or flush all the toilets and start the dishwasher,

381
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,436
so I just stood there.

382
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,867
He's got presence.

383
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:55,936
He reads number one best sellers wears clothes out of hampers,

384
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,158
makes any one feel at ease.

385
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:00,771
He's everything I'm not.

386
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:04,334
And I find that incredibly sexy.

387
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,404
That anonymous fuck couldn't possibly see what I do.

388
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:17,525
How long have you been standing there?

389
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,324
How long have you been jerking off to Andrew?

390
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,693
I was not jerking off

391
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,822
Nice boner

392
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,430
I'm still pissed at you

393
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,401
I wouldn't even be talking to you if I wasn't feeling so

394
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:33,339
benevolent after getting reamed by the biggest dick

395
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,342
I've ever seen

396
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,089
That anonymous fuck was yours?

397
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:37,075
Oh yeah

398
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,446
Who a make that the second biggest I've ever seen

399
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:49,451
Made you look

400
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:54,789
By our fifth date, I was convinced Geezer was the

401
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:57,957
real thing and made him my twelfth disciple.

402
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:01,037
So Joey's versing Andrew on the art of being a slut.

403
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,202
It's sad to watch

404
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,364
So is he your type?

405
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,441
Andrew?

406
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:11,109
I do n't have types .

407
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:12,271
I have clients .

408
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:14,673
How noble.

409
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,121
Who's this ?

410
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,552
Are we changing subjects?

411
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:21,737
Do you mind?

412
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,406
Seems like an admission of guilt.

413
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,836
Guilty of what?

414
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,761
Emotion?

415
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,538
That's a portrait of my first lover.

416
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:35,171
My only lover.

417
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,923
We were together fifty years .

418
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,895
Fifty years?

419
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,685
His name is Renaldo .

420
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,950
He's dead now.

421
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,544
You both look so young .

422
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:46,041
We were.

423
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:49,514
He was the son of the building custodian.

424
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:52,348
He was poor and sinewy.

425
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,878
I was rich and spoiled even then,the little prince.

426
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:58,145
How D.H.Lawrence

427
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,064
The first time I saw him, I knew he'd be with me

428
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:07,830
for the rest of my life.

429
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:11,036
Or his, as it turned out.

430
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:12,663
How could you tell?

431
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,167
We had a chemistry.

432
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:16,404
But there was something else.

433
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:20,373
Something peculiar because--

434
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:22,075
He was everything you weren't.

435
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,756
Which was the cause, I believe of our sexual heat.

436
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,783
I remember the day we first fucked .

437
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:33,693
Jesus

438
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:40,505
The waves on the Sound were louder than thunder

439
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,647
I was a teenager.

440
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,276
We'd just moved here from Brussels.

441
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:48,954
I was supposed to be in my quarters, but I'd slipped out

442
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,770
to watch Renaldo work from there.

443
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:56,300
As I waited to catch a glimpse of him,

444
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:59,377
I was distracted by the growing storm.

445
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:03,017
Suddenly a weight came crashing down.

446
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,190
It was Renaldo .

447
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:08,006
And?

448
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,703
He said What are you doing here?

449
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:14,771
My defenses told me to say  None of your business

450
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:20,436
But I took a chance and said Waiting for you

451
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:24,035
That's when he took me.

452
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,237
Took you?

453
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:28,279
He fucked you right there on the stairwell?

454
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:29,516
In like, 1918?

455
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:31,761
Well the year is off.

456
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:32,774
A little.

457
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,827
You're a whore, men have the best sex

458
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:42,348
of their life with you.

459
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:46,662
But make no mistake, the only worthwhile sex

460
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:50,876
is when both parties are doing it to please themselves first.

461
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:53,832
I had no idea what was physically possible

462
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:57,844
between two boys until we kissed

463
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:03,351
Then what?

464
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:06,298
Well, let's save that for next time.

465
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,630
Waiting for you

466
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,568
The words haunted me

467
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:32,665
Another date?

468
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:34,786
Another trick?

469
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:36,579
Actually, no .

470
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,668
Jill's wedding is next weekend

471
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,046
Will you come with me?

472
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:05,369
People might think

473
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,704
I dated her because I was in love with her brother Matthew.

474
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:14,316
He was gorgeous and funny and so protective.

475
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:15,879
And cocky.

476
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,685
And self-centered .

477
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,154
Probably why you loved him .

478
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,743
We were together for three years .

479
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,933
Except for the gay thing, I really loved her.

480
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,263
I left her to find my soul mate.

481
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,878
And you don't want to show up empty-handed

482
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:41,259
Partly that.

483
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:50,366
And partly to have a trial run with you .

484
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:53,756
That was the fastest erection I ever got

485
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,264
A top. Thank God.

486
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:04,402
Trial run?

487
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,665
Yeah. A weekend together.

488
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:09,275
Go to Portland get this thing out of our system .

489
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:10,776
Two seconds ago you're talking about looking for

490
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,244
your soulmate and now it's about this thing

491
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:13,916
you want to get out of your system?

492
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:16,154
I just meant get to know each other.

493
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,878
You do not know me?

494
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,419
You've lived with me for a year!

495
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:22,784
X, nobody knows you .

496
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:23,884
Ouch.

497
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,349
Let me be the first.

498
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:28,157
I don't want to be one of your hookups

499
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,390
Not in front of the Beaver.

500
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,828
I am so in love!

501
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,633
Interrupting something?

502
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:36,997
Please.

503
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,699
Who's your latest victim?

504
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,111
I like to think of them as host bodies .

505
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,637
for my heart.

506
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:46,106
So you're swearing off other men?

507
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,082
I'm in love. Not insane.

508
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:50,056
He wants an open relationship .

509
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,179
It's perfect.

510
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,911
And you discussed this on your first date?

511
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:56,351
Our first date's tonight.

512
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:00,094
I'm at the bus stop and this beautiful guy comes up to me

513
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:01,625
and says ''smile.''

514
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,139
I looked at him .

515
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:05,225
And I did .

516
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,566
That's the worst come on line ever.

517
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,728
It pisses me off when guys say that.

518
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,397
I'll be perfectly fine.

519
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:14,024
Then some asshole says smile.

520
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:16,309
Like I'm in a bad mood, and if I am I owe it to him

521
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:18,937
to cover it up and make his world a brighter place.

522
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,708
You're sensitive for an ice queen .

523
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,516
You know what line pisses me off?

524
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:25,651
I'm not normally into black guys but

525
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,301
They need to be shot.

526
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:29,423
It's like on this must be my lucky night.

527
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,082
You're feeling abnormal

528
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,421
and I'm black.

529
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,083
I like any come on line.

530
00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:38,458
They're compliments .

531
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,626
How can you have too many compliments?

532
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,195
Leave it here it's that Stella Stevens prostitute movie.

533
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,674
I loved prostitute movies.

534
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,539
Liz Taylor in Butterfield 8.

535
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,635
Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

536
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,148
Marlene Dietrich in every movie she made.

537
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:56,075
As a kid I thought prostitutes were

538
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,125
the most beautiful creatures alive.

539
00:27:58,352 --> 00:28:00,445
They were wise-cracking, extravagant,

540
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:02,044
and you always learned from them.

541
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:03,715
I felt destined to join the ranks of all the

542
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,645
Hollywood actresses who'd ever played a prostitute.

543
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,692
I asked my mother if I could be a prostitute

544
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,025
when I grew up.

545
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:11,997
She simply said

546
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,033
No

547
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:17,678
X, who was your first date?

548
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,038
What does that have do to with anything?

549
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:23,740
This is an ambush?

550
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,608
Andrew and I don't know anything about you,

551
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,948
so let's start with something big .

552
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:33,486
Well, let's just say that some dentists open wide

553
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:35,022
for their patients .

554
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:37,944
Your dentist had sex with you?

555
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,317
Hot.

556
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:40,248
And paid me.

557
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:41,489
How old were you?

558
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,396
My last two years of high school

559
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:44,556
It happened more than once?

560
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:45,513
Almost weekly.

561
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:46,524
Was he cute?

562
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,098
Not particularly.

563
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,227
That's molestation .

564
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,429
He should be put away.

565
00:28:50,504 --> 00:28:51,994
They should erect a statue of him .

566
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:52,958
It paid for college.

567
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:54,021
But you were like a minor.

568
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:55,080
He took advantage of you .

569
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,244
Who's barely 18 and already blown half the Seahawks?

570
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:01,042
I'm attracted to them, it's consensual .

571
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,844
I was attracted to the money.

572
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:07,086
I don't have issues with hustling if someone chooses it,

573
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,713
I just have a problem with people pushing kids into it.

574
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:14,092
Are you considering choosing it?

575
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,162
Hell no .

576
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:17,293
I'm living rent free.

577
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:20,528
Young man you need to get a job or go to school

578
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,899
Forgive me Father, I was too lazy to do more

579
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,597
than pretend everything would be alright.

580
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:28,000
The next day was a big happy family day.

581
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:29,826
The last one for a while.

582
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,911
park We strolled through Volunteer park.

583
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,844
Cruised hotties on Broadway.

584
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:37,372
Then went home and mutually masturbated.

585
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:39,753
You wish.

586
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,726
Check that one out.

587
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,494
I have to have him .

588
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:49,494
You're kidding

589
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,217
I want my Ding

590
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,664
I want my Dong .

591
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:56,032
I give'me three weeks .

592
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:59,366
Once more with sarcasm you sounded a little too jealous

593
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:01,821
I'm go in an take both of them .

594
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:03,560
Anyone wanna dance?

595
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,680
Watch Blowy Joey in action?

596
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:07,044
C'mon, X.

597
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,206
Come shake your money-maker.

598
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:10,750
I'm not covered for shaken money-maker syndrome. Sorry.

599
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,217
Laters, Taters

600
00:30:16,957 --> 00:30:18,636
Sorry if I freaked you out last night.

601
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,567
I'm not that freakable.

602
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:25,881
Still, come to the wedding .

603
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,433
As a favor to a friend .

604
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:30,035
I thought you weren't out to anyone back there.

605
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:31,576
That's what the trip's for.

606
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:34,224
I do not think I can do it alone.

607
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,208
You talk to your mother every week.

608
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:37,281
It'll be fine.

609
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,743
No, it's different.

610
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,545
A middle-class black family from Oregon?

611
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:42,843
It's always different.

612
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,078
For every family.

613
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,344
What'd your family do?

614
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,819
They never noticed when I left home, so I certainly

615
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,379
didn't call to tell them who I was fucking .

616
00:30:50,972 --> 00:30:52,120
I thought you hadn't fucked anyone

617
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:53,055
since you were twelve.

618
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:55,495
You know what I mean .

619
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,531
I wish I did .

620
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:01,793
I'll go .

621
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,038
As a friend .

622
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,232
They're totally taking me to a bathroom stall

623
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,237
Andrew?

624
00:31:11,312 --> 00:31:13,473
Will you stand guard?

625
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:18,042
You owe me big .

626
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:19,880
Thank you B.R.B !

627
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,191
You might find it domestic, but there's

628
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,705
a certain sense of power that a garden gives you

629
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,229
It's almost godlike.

630
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,304
Got shit?

631
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,173
Buttloads .

632
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:42,366
I just put Junior to bed .

633
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:45,112
He's growing so fast.

634
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,034
Well, I didn't check that.

635
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:02,894
Are you in love with me?

636
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:05,310
Absolutely not.

637
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,945
Why did I say that?

638
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,194
Oh god whatever you do do not jump off this building.

639
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:15,504
I thought I was in love with you .

640
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:17,524
For the longest time.

641
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:20,304
Until I realized we couldn't be together.

642
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:23,911
Why, you want an open relationship too?

643
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:25,656
Actually, yeah . Partly that.

644
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:27,276
You've been spending too much time

645
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,015
in the land of Blowy Joey.

646
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:31,614
Okay, you'd give up hooking for a relationship?

647
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,393
Don't call it that.

648
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:38,350
You'd give up your career for monogamy?

649
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:40,862
That's not cheating. That's just business .

650
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:43,647
Don't even pretend you don't know how fucked up that sounds .

651
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:46,372
To the logical person it makes sense.

652
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:49,167
Would you ever consider quitting?

653
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:53,307
I make a lot of fucking money.

654
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,147
I can't do anything else.

655
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,151
I do not want to do anything else, I'm good at it.

656
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:02,078
I got nothing but love for you baby,

657
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:04,429
but you're twenty-five.

658
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:07,891
And that's already over the hill for a lot of logical people.

659
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:10,760
And working at a videostore has a promising future?

660
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:12,020
It's legal .

661
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:16,531
So, if I were dating you, I could sleep with my same

662
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:19,300
twelve clients, as long as I didn't get paid?

663
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,471
If it made you happy.

664
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:23,652
Getting paid makes me happy.

665
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,561
It hurts me.

666
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:28,931
You fucking anything with a clever screen name hurts me.

667
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,397
It's like anyone can fulfill you .

668
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:32,835
What would make me special?

669
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:36,129
But if I charged them, you'd be okay with that?

670
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,051
What makes me special?

671
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,820
There's nothing special about you

672
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:44,288
I'm Kidding .

673
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,380
That's your problem .

674
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:50,872
You're too funny for your own good

675
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,371
You know why I do not always listen to you?

676
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:57,360
Because sometimes I do not feel like laughing

677
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:58,305
No .

678
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:02,145
The real problem is, I used to live with a decent,

679
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:06,915
attractive guy who sometimes I imagined dating one day.

680
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:12,050
But that guy has become a very ugly faggot who will

681
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:15,823
suck off anything with a cock and probably die

682
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:19,889
long before achieving his dream of becoming manager of Videomania.

683
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:24,028
Forgive me Father, I was wrathful.

684
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:28,898
Okay, you win .

685
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:35,509
Always do .

686
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:49,522
Is that a cross word?

687
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:52,930
Yeah

688
00:34:56,604 --> 00:34:57,935
Sometimes you amaze me.

689
00:35:00,507 --> 00:35:03,406
Andrew says to say he's not talking to you .

690
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,978
Well, tell Andrew

691
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,447
Make it good, 'cause you each get one message.

692
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:10,483
I do not wanna be asking people to

693
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:12,280
pass the lube to each other.

694
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:15,617
Just tell him I said ''okay.''

695
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:19,492
''Okay.'' Clever, could go either way.

696
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:22,485
X?

697
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:26,909
I'm not so amazing .

698
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:28,565
Huh ?

699
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:32,072
There's a really cute guy at the laundromat who always

700
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,022
does the cross word while he's waiting .

701
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:36,474
So I do it ahead of time.

702
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:39,478
Then if he looks stuck, I can help him and act like

703
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:41,241
I just thought up the answer.

704
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:44,317
You still amaze me.

705
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,112
I'm eighteen and I've do not have a job or a boyfriend .

706
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,587
How can I ever be rich and famous if I don't

707
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:51,284
even do anything?

708
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,561
Why is it that gays always feel forty at eighteen ?

709
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:56,628
That's what college is for.

710
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,894
X?

711
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:03,197
Yes?

712
00:36:07,474 --> 00:36:09,066
You amaze me too .

713
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:32,789
I'm a monster.

714
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:37,467
So, was the dentist your first?

715
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,306
And there's a story.

716
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,001
About a friend .

717
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:51,231
Not about you .

718
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:57,317
Okay, this story's about cousins .

719
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:58,585
Teenagers .

720
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,555
Barely.

721
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:03,637
Do they have names?

722
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,164
Let's call the older one Andy,and the younger one

723
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:10,795
John?

724
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:13,938
John .

725
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:15,189
Let's call them that.

726
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:24,968
Andy was a jock and the center of attention.

727
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,809
He entertained the family with tales

728
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,470
of making first string.

729
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:31,852
John was pudgy and awkward, and the only string

730
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:34,587
he cared about was the one holding up Andy's sweats.

731
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,070
Oh dear.

732
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,891
One Sunday, pick any one, they're alone

733
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,073
in the basement TV room.

734
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:43,969
Andy blurts out I got a girlfriend.

735
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:45,921
This chick from school, Jennifer.

736
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:49,706
John hates her name. It's silly and common .

737
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,018
It's no Andy

738
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:53,003
''What's she look like?'' John asks.

739
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,055
''A whole lot better'n you. ''

740
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:59,116
It's just a joke, but it kills something in John,

741
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:02,961
who says sure took you long enough to start dating girls.

742
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,390
Andy twists John's arm .

743
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:07,393
''What are you trying to say?

744
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:09,861
I told you I finally have a girlfriend

745
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,125
because you're my best friend

746
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,282
And John?

747
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:14,971
Some tears.

748
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,333
Andy apologizes.

749
00:38:16,403 --> 00:38:19,177
He says, I'm just kidding.

750
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:21,716
I'll always like you better than her

751
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:22,736
And then ?

752
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:26,273
Let's save that for the next visit.

753
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,906
U h-u h . I'm not falling for that old ruse.

754
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:30,841
Next visit begins now.

755
00:38:35,556 --> 00:38:39,754
Andy brushes his head against John's cheek.

756
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:41,334
Touches his lips .

757
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:46,164
Like the horny virgins they are, it all happens .

758
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,697
Mmm .

759
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:50,211
Horny love-struck virgins .

760
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:51,287
How was it?

761
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,101
Unbelievable.

762
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,666
I remember every single thing we did in those

763
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:58,438
thirty-seven minutes.

764
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:03,575
It was the first and only time I've ever been taken .

765
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,379
It won't be the last.

766
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:07,171
I certainly hope not.

767
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:12,151
Anyway when it's over, Andy panics .

768
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,699
He tells John it's wrong, it can't ever happen again.

769
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,261
He runs away.

770
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,243
John's devastated .

771
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,614
What does he do?

772
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:21,954
He walks home.

773
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,719
Twelve miles.

774
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:26,042
When Andy calls, John won't answer.

775
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,664
They never really talk again .

776
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:32,627
Poor Andy.

777
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,295
Poor Andy?

778
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,856
I suppose you think Renaldo and I were happy from the start,

779
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,679
but it's just not true.

780
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:45,228
After our first encounter, he was unavailable for weeks .

781
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,849
Where'd he go?

782
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:50,514
I never knew, but when he returned, I confronted him

783
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,161
I said, you're avoiding me.

784
00:39:54,264 --> 00:39:57,567
You're afraid of feeling towards me the way

785
00:39:57,638 --> 00:40:00,162
a man feels towards a lover.

786
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:01,805
And?

787
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,692
That night he held me so close.

788
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:07,461
I knew he loved me.

789
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:11,817
So maybe Andy

790
00:40:13,153 --> 00:40:14,518
Perhaps .

791
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:18,429
I hadn't thought about Andy for years .

792
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:22,052
And Andrew, the similarity of their names

793
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,625
is not lost on me.

794
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,628
The next few days were awkward around the house.

795
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:29,165
Andrew was ignoring me.

796
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,264
And Joey

797
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:36,234
I hate you both !

798
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:43,482
Andrew, I'm sorry.

799
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:50,085
So I poured myself in to my work.

800
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,688
Twelve steps to a happier me.

801
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,522
You look handsome.

802
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:03,301
Going out?

803
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,713
I haven't left this apartment for eight years .

804
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:10,876
I'm just trying to vary the scenery.

805
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:15,678
What makes you available to night?

806
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,412
I guess I'm avoiding home.

807
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:25,334
Why haven't you left your apartment?

808
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,997
I haven't left since Renaldo died?

809
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,208
Oh, what's this?

810
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:53,211
I'm ready, Gregory.

811
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:01,117
I desire you as much as you desire me.

812
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,066
You don't desire me.

813
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:17,336
You're just confused and lonely and horny.

814
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,138
I guess you're right.

815
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:27,778
Any news on this wedding?

816
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:31,029
Why does he want me to go?

817
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:33,506
What does he want from me?

818
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:35,095
Yes.

819
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,603
Excellent questions.

820
00:42:37,914 --> 00:42:42,109
A road trip seems a perfect opportunity to explore them .

821
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:52,277
I should be going, it's late.

822
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,052
Aren't you forgetting something?

823
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,422
Thanks .

824
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:21,936
Damn, Hottie Central, hi !

825
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:23,007
Call us !

826
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:26,709
Oh my god !

827
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:29,681
I can stick around .

828
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:30,773
Likewise.

829
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,902
Okay, I'm out.

830
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:36,283
Nice to meet you .

831
00:43:36,356 --> 00:43:37,584
Night, Joey.

832
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,695
I'm sorry, X.

833
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:45,253
I'm really sorry.

834
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:46,594
It's a free country.

835
00:43:57,711 --> 00:43:59,076
I didn't mean to hurt you .

836
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,206
Who said I was hurt?

837
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:20,553
I'm so totally in love with you .

838
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:28,364
I know you think I'm a loser and a slut and stupid

839
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:29,352
Joey

840
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,471
I thought if I could be with Andrew I could

841
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:32,603
at least be on your radar.

842
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,123
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:41,286
I don't think any less of you .

844
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,321
Because you never thought any of me in the first place.

845
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,660
This self-pity routine is seriously

846
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:05,102
Joey, since I met you there hasn't been a day

847
00:45:05,178 --> 00:45:06,702
I didn't fight to stop myself

848
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,873
from ripping off your clothes .

849
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:10,890
Liar.

850
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:14,985
I can think of a hundred reasons it would be

851
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:16,509
wonderful to be with you .

852
00:45:21,027 --> 00:45:22,624
But I know it wouldn't work.

853
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:24,854
Who cares why it wouldn't work.

854
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,694
Because we'd find out why.

855
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,567
And we'd lose everything we have.

856
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:31,943
It's not so bad .

857
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:34,747
Losing everything .

858
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:36,920
What would you know about that?

859
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,251
Well, my whole fucking house burned down once.

860
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:41,912
Really?

861
00:45:41,982 --> 00:45:44,014
I lost everything .

862
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:49,385
My dog Mindy, who just learned to sit.

863
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:52,772
My diary.

864
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:55,754
You kept one?

865
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:02,719
From first grade on . I wrote in it every day.

866
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:06,843
All about figuring out how I was gay.

867
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:09,297
Poetry.

868
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,751
Drawings .

869
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:15,738
Every experience I had in the world .

870
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:18,417
Poof.

871
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:21,855
I'm sorry.

872
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:24,553
Be sure to write good stuff about me.

873
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:27,604
I don't keep one anymore.

874
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:32,095
Since then I decided to live for right now.

875
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:36,769
Come on, Joey.

876
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:38,368
You're so cute.

877
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,768
Joey, please.

878
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:42,587
Joey.

879
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:44,197
Joey?

880
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:47,336
Oh shit.

881
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:48,836
Joey, can you hear me?

882
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:50,644
Joey, listen to me.

883
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:51,843
I love you .

884
00:46:51,918 --> 00:46:53,072
Joey?

885
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,717
Fuck.

886
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:56,290
Andrew!

887
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:56,844
Andrew!

888
00:46:56,923 --> 00:46:57,981
It's Joey!

889
00:46:58,058 --> 00:46:58,922
Joey listen to me.

890
00:46:58,992 --> 00:46:59,981
Everything's going to be alright.

891
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,118
Shit, what happened?

892
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:03,810
What drugs did you guys do?

893
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,962
He drank the rest of that? !

894
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:05,929
The rest of what?

895
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:06,727
G H B .

896
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,894
There was like another half a dose in there.

897
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,232
He should be okay, he just fell out.

898
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,104
Allow me to take this moment for a public service announcement.

899
00:47:14,174 --> 00:47:16,404
I actually advocate the legalization of most

900
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:19,502
recreational drugs, particularly marijuana.

901
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:21,527
Especially marijuana.

902
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:24,792
Legalization and education, so like with alcohol,

903
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:28,319
we don't have to rely on urban legend for responsible usage.

904
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:29,719
What the fuck do you mean, fell out?

905
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:30,949
We should call someone.

906
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:33,720
They could put him in jail  G's a tranquilizer.

907
00:47:33,793 --> 00:47:36,057
If you do too much, it will make you fall asleep .

908
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,731
He's okay, he's just sleeping .

909
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:41,350
Who'd you learn this from, your drug dealer?

910
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,570
Trust me, he'll be fine.

911
00:47:47,107 --> 00:47:47,969
Look

912
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,642
I don't care how many drugs or orgies you have,

913
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:56,420
that's your trip .

914
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,862
But if you hurt Joey

915
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:03,025
To be fair, they were partying when I got here.

916
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:06,324
I partook in the sex, not the drugs .

917
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:09,652
Oh, what a relief.

918
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:18,601
I'm sorry.

919
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:24,734
It's okay.

920
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:28,783
I mean about everything .

921
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:30,806
No

922
00:48:33,253 --> 00:48:35,448
I'm sorry.

923
00:48:35,522 --> 00:48:39,322
No one deserves to hear the things I said to you .

924
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:41,675
You were right.

925
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,330
I was wrong .

926
00:48:57,444 --> 00:48:58,476
You're not my father!

927
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:00,479
Yeah, I actually give a shit about you .

928
00:49:00,547 --> 00:49:01,639
You can't ground me!

929
00:49:01,714 --> 00:49:02,703
No one's grounding you .

930
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:04,100
You can do as you please.

931
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:06,742
We just really think Andrew or I should go with you

932
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,515
while you go clubbing for a while That's all

933
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:10,579
It's no big deal, people black out every day.

934
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,852
People overdose and die every day.

935
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:14,484
Do I look like Cyndi Lauper?

936
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:16,088
She's not dead .

937
00:49:16,138 --> 00:49:16,873
Whoever.

938
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,579
I've been taking care of myself for a long time.

939
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:20,830
That's the problem .

940
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,368
Look hon, we just think one of us should

941
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:24,642
be around for you is all .

942
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:26,176
Why, so you can fuck me again?

943
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,736
How about, if I'm good for three months

944
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,501
X has to fuck me.

945
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,399
So uneed fair to me.

946
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:32,232
Hell no !

947
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,446
I'll save up my allowance.

948
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,480
Go to your room !

949
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:35,479
Fuck you !

950
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:39,879
Sounds like a good idea.

951
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:45,724
Since it was our first date, I figured I'd take Andrew

952
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,123
to Portland in style.

953
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:51,773
God damn!

954
00:49:52,131 --> 00:49:53,564
You rented that for a road trip?

955
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:55,396
You don't want'em to think you're a fag

956
00:49:55,468 --> 00:49:56,763
and dating a loser.

957
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,561
I'm so used to being treated by sugar daddies that

958
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:02,005
the whole role reversal was refreshing.

959
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:16,042
Joey'll be alright. Right?

960
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:19,786
He'll be fine, it's us I'm worried about.

961
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,007
Ever been on a road trip?

962
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,339
Eight years ago .

963
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,661
God, I keep forgetting how old you are.

964
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:48,120
I'm like a year older than you .

965
00:50:48,187 --> 00:50:49,415
15 months .

966
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:51,237
And I haven't been gay for a whole decade.

967
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,121
Where'd you go?

968
00:50:53,393 --> 00:50:54,464
Seattle.

969
00:50:54,961 --> 00:50:56,428
Good-bye small town .

970
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:57,747
Hello small city.

971
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:00,716
I'm glad you made the trip .

972
00:51:01,921 --> 00:51:02,954
Both of them .

973
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:08,163
So why are your parents going to your ex-fiancee's wedding?

974
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:14,607
I think there's some hope of a dramatic objection

975
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:16,739
at the last second when I stop the wedding and

976
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,640
confess my love for Jill .

977
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,082
This should be fun .

978
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:22,393
How long were you with Jill?

979
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:25,114
Engaged for a year, dated for three.

980
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,068
She doesn't know I'm gay.

981
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,809
All because you wanted to do her brother?

982
00:51:30,096 --> 00:51:31,563
Don't tell me you have a kid somewhere.

983
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:32,580
No .

984
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,704
Maybe someday though .

985
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,130
How about you?

986
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,013
Joey's plenty.

987
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:40,936
You're really good with him .

988
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:43,335
You too, apparently.

989
00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:48,169
Seriously, you'd make a good father.

990
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,079
The only good fatherly quality about me

991
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,084
is that I know I shouldn't have kids .

992
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:10,971
Make any money?

993
00:52:11,304 --> 00:52:14,330
Nah, but I shoved my business cards in the glory holes .

994
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,106
So am I pretending to be your boyfriend?

995
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,304
Roommate?

996
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:23,300
Fuckbuddy?

997
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:26,501
Let's just play it by ear.

998
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:29,487
Anything else should I know about your family?

999
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:30,967
They're black.

1000
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:33,931
Oh, let's go back to Seattle.

1001
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,683
I've heard about those people.

1002
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,052
You'll probably be the only white guy at this thing .

1003
00:52:39,165 --> 00:52:40,860
I've never been one to fit in .

1004
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:43,401
Have you been anywhere where you were the only white person?

1005
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:46,438
At least I won't be the only fag .

1006
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:55,975
I love club music.

1007
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,641
Everything is so cut and dried.

1008
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,651
You love someone, set them free.

1009
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,414
Love me or let me go.

1010
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:02,920
Prove your love.

1011
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:04,456
My love is your love.

1012
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:06,185
It's love or it's not love.

1013
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:07,556
Love is sex.

1014
00:53:07,627 --> 00:53:08,840
Sex is love.

1015
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:11,288
I defy you to find a club an them that says I love you

1016
00:53:11,364 --> 00:53:13,832
but I'm not really sure what love is all about

1017
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,630
and I still want to have sex with blah-blah-blah

1018
00:53:16,703 --> 00:53:18,830
Those things are harder to rhyme.

1019
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,594
Take your time.

1020
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:24,141
Please.

1021
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:26,761
So what are your folks' names?

1022
00:53:27,346 --> 00:53:28,643
That might be helpful .

1023
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:30,570
Oren and Zelma.

1024
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,072
And there's Cheyenne.

1025
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:33,445
Who?

1026
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:34,816
My sister.

1027
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:35,858
She's twelve.

1028
00:53:36,022 --> 00:53:38,718
Imagine me with corn rows, A-cups

1029
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,693
and a mouth the size of Lake Union .

1030
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:43,287
I usually do .

1031
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,224
Hello baby!

1032
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,894
This is my roommate.

1033
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:56,274
I told your ass he was gay!

1034
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:57,775
And I told you Andrew will talk about it

1035
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:58,952
when he is ready to .

1036
00:53:59,145 --> 00:54:00,407
He looks ready to me.

1037
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,606
Don't mind Cheyenne.

1038
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:03,464
She's been watching to o much Showtime.

1039
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:05,915
How long you been dating my brother?

1040
00:54:05,985 --> 00:54:06,997
Cheyenne!

1041
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:10,433
So how long you boys been roommates?

1042
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:12,159
Just over a year, sir.

1043
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:13,163
A year?

1044
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:14,693
That's a long time.

1045
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:17,355
I'm happy to see you're not alone.

1046
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:24,601
How long have you known?

1047
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,612
Since you were eight.

1048
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,157
But I wasn't sure until you broke up with Jill

1049
00:54:32,178 --> 00:54:34,042
And what line of business you in son?

1050
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,246
I collect etchings .

1051
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:36,886
You mean like, art?

1052
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:38,774
Like presidents .

1053
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:39,807
On dollar bills .

1054
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:41,713
Better not be no drug dealer.

1055
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:42,517
Cheyenne!

1056
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:44,963
Oh, nothing as glamorous as that.

1057
00:54:45,224 --> 00:54:46,521
I play the stock market.

1058
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:48,287
With enough real estate and bonds in my back pocket

1059
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:49,885
for when things go sour.

1060
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,930
A man after my own heart.

1061
00:54:56,102 --> 00:54:57,694
Did we do something that made you think

1062
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,600
you couldn't tell us?

1063
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:01,343
No, Ma.

1064
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:04,343
You did everything right.

1065
00:55:12,952 --> 00:55:14,317
I'm glad you have someone.

1066
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:19,721
And damn, he is fine.

1067
00:55:25,331 --> 00:55:28,642
Damn I forgot to make up the guestroom !

1068
00:55:29,038 --> 00:55:31,488
You don't have a problem sharing Andrew's bed do you?

1069
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:34,103
Not at all Mrs.Thompson

1070
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:35,970
Call me Zelma.

1071
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,690
Well that wasn't so hard

1072
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:42,801
It's like they would've been upset if I wasn't gay.

1073
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:44,384
What's up with that?

1074
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:45,976
I didn't give them credit

1075
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:49,965
I'm glad I could provide you with immoral support.

1076
00:55:55,294 --> 00:55:58,092
This is my ultimate fantasy.

1077
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:01,363
In your childhood bed?

1078
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:02,004
Hell yeah .

1079
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:05,168
With your folks in the house?

1080
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:06,475
Even hotter.

1081
00:56:06,873 --> 00:56:08,568
It feels weird .

1082
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,859
I mean there's like booties and shit hanging on the wall .

1083
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:11,771
Damn !

1084
00:56:12,945 --> 00:56:14,344
It feels like you feel just fine.

1085
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,048
Andrew.

1086
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:25,958
Do you love me?

1087
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:30,219
I don't know.

1088
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:36,490
Never mind .

1089
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:40,405
Forgive me if I don't know if I'm in love with you yet.

1090
00:56:41,707 --> 00:56:43,038
Let's just stop talking about it.

1091
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:44,576
Before I say something funny.

1092
00:56:47,413 --> 00:56:52,510
I mean, don't get offended X, but can you have sex

1093
00:56:52,585 --> 00:56:54,203
without getting paid for it?

1094
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,045
What do you want from me, Andrew?

1095
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:57,783
You can't change me.

1096
00:56:57,857 --> 00:56:59,119
I don't care you're a hooker.

1097
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:00,180
It's not even about that.

1098
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:01,142
What is it about?

1099
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,637
It's about

1100
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,506
It's about taking a chance.

1101
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:09,432
I don't know if we'll fall in love.

1102
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,269
Love isn't a transaction .

1103
00:57:11,337 --> 00:57:13,800
You don't just get what you putin .

1104
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:17,662
You have no idea what you're talking about.

1105
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:20,606
Let's just call it a night.

1106
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,050
If you keep pushing me away sooner or later

1107
00:57:30,122 --> 00:57:31,104
I'm going to give up .

1108
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:34,206
That's why I like hustling.

1109
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,518
I can predict those relationships.

1110
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:39,063
Clients fulfill my need for human contact

1111
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:41,493
and every date has money back guarantee.

1112
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:47,000
Forgive me Father I was too proud to admit he was right.

1113
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:54,636
Who's Gregory?

1114
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:57,781
What?

1115
00:57:59,218 --> 00:58:00,651
You talk in your sleep .

1116
00:58:01,287 --> 00:58:02,269
Liar.

1117
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:06,532
If you'd slept with someone they would've told you .

1118
00:58:07,556 --> 00:58:09,480
You said,Gregory, I'm ready

1119
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:15,832
He's one of my clients

1120
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:20,402
That's disgusting .

1121
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:24,736
This whole thing was a mistake.

1122
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:25,936
You're telling me.

1123
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:30,506
At least you're out to the family now.

1124
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,050
Please tell me you put these here.

1125
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:37,923
God, Mom must've done it.

1126
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,753
That's so embarrassing .

1127
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:42,451
Hate to disappoint her.

1128
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:48,567
But no problem disappointing me.

1129
00:58:52,104 --> 00:58:53,349
So, let's speed this up .

1130
00:58:53,873 --> 00:58:55,495
Tell me you want me to give up .

1131
00:58:57,343 --> 00:58:58,435
Boys ?!

1132
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,652
Breakfast!

1133
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:01,560
Okay.

1134
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,342
Andrew? !

1135
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:40,986
Candace!

1136
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:41,743
How ya been?

1137
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:43,410
Really great!

1138
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,249
It's awesome to see you !

1139
00:59:45,324 --> 00:59:46,222
Where is everybody?

1140
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:46,810
JJ ?

1141
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,313
And Sheila?

1142
00:59:47,363 --> 00:59:50,754
Jill said she couldn't trust nobody after you dogged her.

1143
00:59:52,398 --> 00:59:54,161
Who's he?

1144
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:57,669
Oh, my, um, room partner.

1145
00:59:57,736 --> 00:59:59,135
Room partner?

1146
01:00:00,756 --> 01:00:02,197
Oh !

1147
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:03,206
Hi .

1148
01:00:03,275 --> 01:00:04,264
Andrew!

1149
01:00:04,343 --> 01:00:07,471
Jill is gonna shit when she sees you !

1150
01:00:07,546 --> 01:00:08,646
She means that in a good way.

1151
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,843
And look what ya brought with ya.

1152
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:13,885
This is Jill's mother Mrs Stevens

1153
01:00:13,953 --> 01:00:16,217
Matthew is not gonna be happy.

1154
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,946
Is Matthew? Jill's brother.

1155
01:00:25,364 --> 01:00:29,212
He got dumped last week so he is not in a good mood

1156
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:32,477
So, why did Jill invite me?

1157
01:00:32,705 --> 01:00:34,195
Of all people.

1158
01:00:34,273 --> 01:00:37,299
My theory she wants to rub it in your face

1159
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:40,402
how happy she is marrying a pro football player and all

1160
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:42,071
Pro football player?

1161
01:00:42,148 --> 01:00:45,015
Well you ain't heard of him cause he technically hasn't

1162
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:47,058
played yet or anything .

1163
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,855
But he's on the payroll .

1164
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:50,513
Like an alternate or something .

1165
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,553
Those are not friends of the bride.

1166
01:01:08,607 --> 01:01:09,693
What are you doing?

1167
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:11,509
Accepting who I am .

1168
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:13,568
It feels like you're showing off.

1169
01:01:17,316 --> 01:01:19,641
Andrew, you seen Matthew?

1170
01:01:19,785 --> 01:01:20,877
No .

1171
01:01:21,451 --> 01:01:22,887
Glad I didn't miss that.

1172
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:38,291
I know it's corny, but isn't it romantic?

1173
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:43,561
I don't believe you want me to give up .

1174
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:46,878
Don't spoil it.

1175
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,180
I wonder if we'll ever be able to do this in our lifetime.

1176
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:09,288
I'm glad you came.

1177
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:13,975
I thought you'd be alone.

1178
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:17,261
Well, I'm not.

1179
01:02:17,951 --> 01:02:19,501
I didn't mean it like that.

1180
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:21,085
I'm glad you're with someone.

1181
01:02:21,814 --> 01:02:22,570
It's just--

1182
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:25,551
There's Matthew.

1183
01:02:25,818 --> 01:02:26,601
Oh?

1184
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:28,977
Where?

1185
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,313
Hey Drew!

1186
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:33,742
I missed the shit out of you !

1187
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,793
You're gay?

1188
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:44,028
I thought Jill announced it in the invites .

1189
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:45,035
Ha ha.

1190
01:02:45,104 --> 01:02:46,628
Bitch, you told a lot of fuckin' people.

1191
01:02:46,705 --> 01:02:48,866
Bitch, you tried to mack on my man .

1192
01:02:49,908 --> 01:02:51,205
Well baby, you can take this one.

1193
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:52,036
I'm through with him .

1194
01:02:56,282 --> 01:02:58,250
Jill said you were funny with the sex thing .

1195
01:03:12,965 --> 01:03:15,832
I can put some frosting on a Dorito if you want.

1196
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:18,366
Can you make it half a Dorito?

1197
01:03:19,405 --> 01:03:21,360
Hi. I'm Jill, the bride.

1198
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:23,170
We haven't had a chance to meet.

1199
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:24,736
Congratulations .

1200
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,262
-I'm a Andrew's room-partner.

1201
01:03:27,479 --> 01:03:29,447
I wonder why he didn't mention you .

1202
01:03:30,145 --> 01:03:30,777
I don't know.

1203
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,176
He talks about you all the time.

1204
01:03:32,284 --> 01:03:33,188
Really?

1205
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,620
What does he say?

1206
01:03:34,787 --> 01:03:38,120
Well, just that you were still are

1207
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,680
the love of his life.

1208
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:40,782
Honey.

1209
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,326
I know you're just trying to be nice.

1210
01:03:42,593 --> 01:03:44,888
But I'm over Andrew. Really.

1211
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:48,998
I think it's my brother who needs comforting .

1212
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:59,934
Pleasure meeting you

1213
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,044
Hey, Uncle X.

1214
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:10,265
Oh, hey Cheyenne.

1215
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:13,047
This makes you my uncle, doesn't it?

1216
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:14,989
I think it would be something more like

1217
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,220
your brother-in-law

1218
01:04:25,137 --> 01:04:26,900
Maybe ex-brother-in-law.

1219
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,289
Hey don't mind me.

1220
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:51,840
I give up .

1221
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:54,998
You win again .

1222
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:01,099
I really wanted a different ending .

1223
01:05:03,321 --> 01:05:04,971
As long as we get an ending .

1224
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:18,981
Forgive me Father I was insanely jealous.

1225
01:05:24,663 --> 01:05:25,896
What are you doing?

1226
01:05:27,255 --> 01:05:29,462
Shit. This isn't their rental?

1227
01:05:35,507 --> 01:05:38,101
It wasn't a practical decision to leave Portland without him,

1228
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:40,372
but I couldn't face five hours in a car with him.

1229
01:05:40,846 --> 01:05:42,006
I reserved him a plane ticket

1230
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,513
and left a message on his cell.

1231
01:05:43,582 --> 01:05:45,413
I'm not a total asshole.

1232
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,577
I hate cars.

1233
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:49,780
I miss my bike.

1234
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,056
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

1235
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:11,566
Don't any couples just fall in love and that's that?

1236
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,540
Very few, I suspect.

1237
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:19,112
He said I could keep hustling, but it'd hurt him .

1238
01:06:22,287 --> 01:06:23,987
What's keeping you from quitting?

1239
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:27,088
The truth is

1240
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:30,451
I like it.

1241
01:06:32,998 --> 01:06:34,296
And that's it?

1242
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:36,425
I don't know.

1243
01:06:37,382 --> 01:06:38,636
I think you do.

1244
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:44,280
When a client pays me

1245
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:47,942
it feels like a relief.

1246
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:51,483
Something inside me let's go .

1247
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:53,944
Do you think you could feel the same

1248
01:06:54,019 --> 01:06:59,620
if your were paid in feelings instead of money?

1249
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,513
That's hard to imagine.

1250
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,455
Maybe you should give your imagination

1251
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:04,723
more of a chance.

1252
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,929
What brought you here?

1253
01:07:33,058 --> 01:07:36,585
We're friends now, but don't let that stop you

1254
01:07:36,662 --> 01:07:39,187
from treating me like a complete slut.

1255
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:39,014
If you're smart, you probably guessed

1256
01:08:39,091 --> 01:08:40,991
I found Gregory dead the next morning .

1257
01:08:41,059 --> 01:08:42,424
Every story with a charming old man ends

1258
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,257
in a heart-tugging funeral .

1259
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:48,992
Well I didn't.

1260
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,113
That might've been easier.

1261
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:15,157
Forgive me Father, I consumed more than I required .

1262
01:09:23,335 --> 01:09:24,498
Are you a friend of Gregory's?

1263
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,769
A very good friend .

1264
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:27,662
And you are?

1265
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,366
Also a good friend .

1266
01:09:29,524 --> 01:09:32,069
He gets older, they get younger.

1267
01:09:34,146 --> 01:09:35,312
Renaldo?

1268
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,953
Why yes, he talked about. But, you're dead .

1269
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,218
I don't know what foolishness he's been up to,

1270
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:43,871
but I assure you, I'm quite alive.

1271
01:09:44,717 --> 01:09:45,945
You're his lover?

1272
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,816
Gregory's not gay.

1273
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:49,815
At least he won't admit to it.

1274
01:09:49,928 --> 01:09:52,453
I don't know why he bothers keeping up the charade

1275
01:09:52,531 --> 01:09:54,294
after so many years .

1276
01:09:54,878 --> 01:09:55,892
How do you know him?

1277
01:09:56,783 --> 01:09:57,831
He pays me!

1278
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:02,502
Gregory was one of my first friends,

1279
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,236
a role-model for how I saw myself as an old queer.

1280
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:08,177
That withered old shit spent months fucking with my head

1281
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,976
like a horny Hannibal Lecter with his sepia stories

1282
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:13,175
of prehistoric teen porn.

1283
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:16,148
And I fell for every word, sprung from a self-serving,

1284
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:18,781
self-loathing lie to keep him in his closet.

1285
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:22,449
I fucked him because I wanted him

1286
01:10:22,527 --> 01:10:24,318
and I had shit to show for it.

1287
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:27,191
This is exactly what I hate about the gay scene.

1288
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:28,562
Sex for nothing.

1289
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,780
He sounds like a psychopath .

1290
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:33,603
A goddamned charming psychopath .

1291
01:11:12,878 --> 01:11:15,972
Wait, I'm not quite as pathetic as I should be.

1292
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:19,851
There.

1293
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:21,575
Much more Charlie Brown.

1294
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:34,025
This is what I deserve for thinking maybe

1295
01:11:34,099 --> 01:11:37,000
gay men are capable of loving something other than themselves.

1296
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,711
I'm not even sure I love myself.

1297
01:11:40,405 --> 01:11:42,703
I'd dump me the second something better came along.

1298
01:11:48,146 --> 01:11:49,567
The lesbians have it easy.

1299
01:11:49,748 --> 01:11:51,409
Sure they have all that dyke drama,

1300
01:11:51,483 --> 01:11:53,610
but it's only because they give a shit about each other.

1301
01:11:55,554 --> 01:11:56,384
Fuck this.

1302
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:15,364
You must be Joey.

1303
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:18,866
There's this old guy here who wants to see you .

1304
01:12:20,645 --> 01:12:21,397
What?

1305
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,305
Yeah, and he wants tea.

1306
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,480
Andrew.

1307
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:30,486
You don't know me.

1308
01:12:31,122 --> 01:12:32,244
Correct.

1309
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,018
I'm a friend of X's .

1310
01:12:34,426 --> 01:12:35,518
Gregory Talbot.

1311
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:39,924
The Gregory he, uh, works with?

1312
01:12:39,998 --> 01:12:40,705
I need .

1313
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,921
He spoke of me?

1314
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:45,876
Technically.

1315
01:12:49,608 --> 01:12:50,953
Why don't you put on some tea.

1316
01:12:51,209 --> 01:12:53,221
Please, who has tea?

1317
01:12:55,213 --> 01:12:57,807
Just warm up some water and I'll be fine.

1318
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:08,022
I haven't been out of my rooms since Diana's memorial,

1319
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:09,548
but I thought this was worth it.

1320
01:13:10,161 --> 01:13:12,005
Might I have a few moments of your time?

1321
01:13:12,364 --> 01:13:14,257
I assume it's about X?

1322
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,627
He's very upset.

1323
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,759
And he sent you here of all people?

1324
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:21,701
I assure you, he'd disembowel me

1325
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:23,818
if he were aware of my presence.

1326
01:13:26,645 --> 01:13:28,160
I'm listening .

1327
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:31,777
I told him the story of two young men who declared

1328
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,597
their love for each other.

1329
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:37,079
They lived a long and happy life together.

1330
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,419
How sweet.

1331
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:43,926
One order of freshly microwaved tap water.

1332
01:13:43,995 --> 01:13:45,553
Smells delicious .

1333
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,722
What a lovely shirt.

1334
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:47,811
So energetic.

1335
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:49,062
Thanks !

1336
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:50,532
It was half off.

1337
01:13:50,602 --> 01:13:52,001
A shrewd purchase.

1338
01:13:57,442 --> 01:14:01,640
So do I get to listen or do I have to come up with

1339
01:14:01,713 --> 01:14:03,821
some excuse to give you guys privacy?

1340
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:06,160
''I've got a hot date''has always worked for me.

1341
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:07,045
Fine.

1342
01:14:07,419 --> 01:14:08,990
It was a pleasure warming your water.

1343
01:14:12,424 --> 01:14:14,094
So what happens with your love story?

1344
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:18,092
In reality, they never declared their love

1345
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:23,057
One of them was too afraid .

1346
01:14:25,737 --> 01:14:29,434
He would always pull away at the last moment.

1347
01:14:31,643 --> 01:14:34,134
He had a lot of free time and spent most of it

1348
01:14:34,212 --> 01:14:40,208
replaying how his life would have been had he seized a moment,

1349
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:43,163
any one of a thousand,

1350
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,415
to take his friend's hand .

1351
01:14:48,994 --> 01:14:50,770
Sounds like they were both afraid .

1352
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,623
They went fifty years, a lifetime.

1353
01:14:59,547 --> 01:15:01,263
And being afraid became habit.

1354
01:15:03,074 --> 01:15:04,472
Did he ever figure out what he was afraid of?

1355
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:06,281
Oh, he knew all along .

1356
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:08,113
What was that?

1357
01:15:08,246 --> 01:15:09,770
That he might have to change.

1358
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:15,343
He was afraid of losing the life he might not

1359
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:19,142
be afforded if it were known he was a man who loved men .

1360
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:21,353
His travels, studies .

1361
01:15:21,556 --> 01:15:23,076
His trust fund .

1362
01:15:23,828 --> 01:15:25,345
At least he lived as he pleased .

1363
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:27,142
No . He changed anyway.

1364
01:15:29,134 --> 01:15:30,431
He's a recluse now.

1365
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:35,769
He's lost it all and people talk about him none the less .

1366
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,210
That's a fucked up story.

1367
01:15:40,612 --> 01:15:41,807
How is that supposed to help me?

1368
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,070
I wasn't aware you were in need of help .

1369
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,407
Well how is that supposed to help X?

1370
01:15:46,484 --> 01:15:47,678
I'm moving out anyway.

1371
01:15:47,952 --> 01:15:50,284
Perhaps it was naive to think I could help someone

1372
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:52,380
who sincerely cared for me.

1373
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:55,890
You paid him .

1374
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,818
I paid him for his time.

1375
01:15:58,499 --> 01:16:00,676
The sincerity was his gift.

1376
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:06,228
So why don't you just tell that guy that you love him now?

1377
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:08,696
Sounds easy, doesn't it.

1378
01:16:15,814 --> 01:16:16,746
Yeah .

1379
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,139
You're a pretty decent guy.

1380
01:16:30,595 --> 01:16:33,651
For a closeted queer who would hire a hustler.

1381
01:16:37,035 --> 01:16:38,293
For anybody.

1382
01:17:08,099 --> 01:17:09,430
Hey, don't I know you?

1383
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,445
From school?

1384
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,162
Oh my God

1385
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:17,277
Blondie!

1386
01:17:18,243 --> 01:17:19,107
Huh?

1387
01:17:22,024 --> 01:17:23,903
You wore a Blondie T-shirt.

1388
01:17:35,393 --> 01:17:36,291
It's okay.

1389
01:17:39,397 --> 01:17:40,421
I'm sorry.

1390
01:17:40,932 --> 01:17:42,058
I'm a freak.

1391
01:17:43,001 --> 01:17:44,025
A cute freak.

1392
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:49,138
Thanks .

1393
01:17:50,675 --> 01:17:51,767
Boyfriend trouble?

1394
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:55,644
Something like that.

1395
01:17:58,116 --> 01:17:59,344
If it makes you feel any better, I just

1396
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:02,511
broke up with this guy. I really liked him .

1397
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,651
What happened?

1398
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,954
I knew he wanted to break up but he didn't have the balls to .

1399
01:18:09,027 --> 01:18:13,764
So he treated me like shit, slept around .

1400
01:18:16,267 --> 01:18:18,497
Ignored me until I was forced to dump him

1401
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,516
at his own work.

1402
01:18:22,707 --> 01:18:24,834
This whole thing is going to turn me straight

1403
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,740
Two wrongs don't make a right.

1404
01:18:30,648 --> 01:18:34,084
I publicly dump this guy that doesn't even like me in B & O.

1405
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:36,750
I'm heart-broken and the asshole.

1406
01:18:37,733 --> 01:18:38,861
Scooter?

1407
01:18:39,157 --> 01:18:40,308
You know him?

1408
01:18:41,123 --> 01:18:44,373
No, but I think I have a story that'll make you feel better.

1409
01:18:44,896 --> 01:18:45,885
Okay.

1410
01:18:47,265 --> 01:18:49,392
I know it's sentimental fluff but it really

1411
01:18:49,467 --> 01:18:50,959
happened that way.

1412
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,901
And it's too important to alter or make edgier.

1413
01:18:54,205 --> 01:18:56,571
Hearing that Joey had passed his behavior on

1414
01:18:56,641 --> 01:18:59,109
to Scooter like avenereal disease made me wonder what

1415
01:18:59,177 --> 01:19:02,271
had I just given to Andrew and where would that end?

1416
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,572
So I guess the old guy couldn't change your mind .

1417
01:19:08,686 --> 01:19:10,483
It's not my mind that needs to be changed .

1418
01:19:10,555 --> 01:19:11,920
So what if you guys aren't boyfriends,

1419
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,550
it doesn't mean you have to move out.

1420
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:14,858
You don't understand .

1421
01:19:14,926 --> 01:19:16,395
I totally understand .

1422
01:19:16,561 --> 01:19:17,493
If it's worth anything,

1423
01:19:17,562 --> 01:19:18,930
I didn't go out while you were gone.

1424
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,389
Now what am I supposed to do? Huh?

1425
01:19:22,734 --> 01:19:24,613
Some role model .

1426
01:19:24,736 --> 01:19:26,328
You don't need a role model .

1427
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,436
You need a good friend .

1428
01:19:30,393 --> 01:19:31,338
You have X.

1429
01:19:34,512 --> 01:19:36,241
X sucks without you .

1430
01:19:39,717 --> 01:19:41,651
Joey had passed over Scooter.

1431
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:43,556
Scooter had passed over Blondie.

1432
01:19:43,855 --> 01:19:45,769
A triangle of back-up plans.

1433
01:19:46,057 --> 01:19:48,216
All three were nice, deserving guys.

1434
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:49,935
What the fuck were they waiting for?

1435
01:19:50,595 --> 01:19:52,070
What am I waiting for?

1436
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:57,464
Wait, I need to plan this out.

1437
01:20:05,877 --> 01:20:07,105
What are you doing down here?

1438
01:20:07,545 --> 01:20:09,604
In that single moment, my defenses told me to say

1439
01:20:09,941 --> 01:20:11,500
''None of your business. ''

1440
01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:12,739
End this once and for all.

1441
01:20:12,817 --> 01:20:14,580
Retreat and lick my wounds in private.

1442
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:15,676
Let him move out.

1443
01:20:15,753 --> 01:20:16,900
Screw these questions.

1444
01:20:17,055 --> 01:20:19,250
Maybe date Joey, my back-up plan.

1445
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:20,916
But I took a chance and said

1446
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,084
Waiting for you .

1447
01:20:24,262 --> 01:20:25,422
That's when he took me.

1448
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:29,655
Almost.

1449
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:37,128
I've been thinking about it and I want to be with you .

1450
01:20:38,176 --> 01:20:42,169
But I want to pay you .

1451
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:44,495
You can't afford me.

1452
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:49,285
Which is why I demand a reduced rate, seeing how

1453
01:20:49,354 --> 01:20:53,256
I'd be your lover with extra responsibilities and all

1454
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:00,394
At that instant I decided it didn't matter

1455
01:21:00,465 --> 01:21:02,111
what we did outside this moment.

1456
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,562
As long as we could have moments like this,

1457
01:21:03,634 --> 01:21:05,011
it was worth hanging on.

1458
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,104
My hustling, his open door policy.

1459
01:21:07,171 --> 01:21:08,604
They meant nothing in this moment

1460
01:21:15,313 --> 01:21:17,611
If this felt so right we should go for it

1461
01:21:17,682 --> 01:21:19,412
and see where the pieces fell

1462
01:21:20,118 --> 01:21:22,305
What happens when you meet Mr.Right too soon?

1463
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,572
You grab him .

1464
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:26,690
There's no such thing as too soon

1465
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,687
Note the new furniture.

1466
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:35,544
That means this is some time later.

1467
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,231
Andrew still makes my knees knock and my heart thud,

1468
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:40,660
even when he brings up the old arguments about hustling

1469
01:21:41,172 --> 01:21:42,706
Eventually I'll stop.

1470
01:21:42,974 --> 01:21:44,464
I've got a sizeable nest egg, and the stocks

1471
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:46,782
I told Andrew's dad about were no bullshit.

1472
01:21:46,911 --> 01:21:49,701
Andrew isn't playing around so much anymore either.

1473
01:21:49,847 --> 01:21:52,941
Funny, at this point I don't really care.

1474
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:54,612
I know where his heart lies.

1475
01:21:55,086 --> 01:21:57,680
Gregory is now my friend and no longer a disciple.

1476
01:21:57,755 --> 01:21:59,586
He's discovered chat rooms.

1477
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,057
He still hasn't confessed his love to Renaldo,

1478
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,492
but Joey's hatched a scheme to hook'em up

1479
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:07,135
introducing Renaldo to the internet as well.

1480
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,666
I finally lured Joey in to attending U-Dub.

1481
01:22:11,736 --> 01:22:13,601
I took him to one of their queer functions and when

1482
01:22:13,671 --> 01:22:16,374
he saw the influx of freshmeat he was hooked.

1483
01:22:20,878 --> 01:22:23,108
I found a new turn on too.

1484
01:22:23,181 --> 01:22:24,808
Writing these confessions.

1485
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:27,680
Selling them to magazines for folks like you.

1486
01:22:27,752 --> 01:22:30,258
Once a whore, always a whore.

1487
01:22:31,269 --> 01:22:34,989
Alex, is X here?

1488
01:22:37,929 --> 01:22:39,897
You request the services of X?

1489
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:53,472
Call me X

1490
01:22:59,984 --> 01:23:01,417
Pleasure doing business with you .

1491
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:08,316
Oh, fuck off.

1492
01:23:08,759 --> 01:23:09,785
It turns me on.

1493
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:11,291
If you were ever in love, you and yours

1494
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,421
handsome corny romantic thing too.

1495
01:23:20,638 --> 01:23:22,125
So, that's my confession.

1496
01:23:22,473 --> 01:23:25,931
Forgive me Father I'm guilty of the deadliest sin.

1497
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:27,656
I'm human.

1498
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:30,673
How many Hail Marys is that?

1499
01:23:35,675 --> 01:23:40,675
