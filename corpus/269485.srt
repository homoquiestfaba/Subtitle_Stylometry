1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,022
I

2
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,469
I love my house.

3
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,376
Everybody does.

4
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,677
It was built in 1895

5
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:55,244
and still has most
of the original roof.

6
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,518
The wallpaper in the dining room
is original, too.

7
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,587
So is a lot of the woodwork.

8
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,327
You'd have to be a fool
to change it.

9
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,871
I hope you appreciate detail.

10
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,773
The marble fireplace
is hand-carved.

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,013
The main stairs have
a very gentle rise.

12
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,282
Everyone comments how easy
it is to climb them.

13
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,553
I like to fill it with my friends.

14
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,938
Over the years,
we've become more like a family.

15
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:04,055
It makes me happy to have us
all together in our home.

16
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,826
Mine and Bobby's.

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,676
They don't build houses
like this anymore.

18
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,613
The golden age
of American house building.

19
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,242
Not architecture, mind you,

20
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,115
but house building.

21
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,179
This house
was meant to stand.

22
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,555
Welcome.

23
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,601
Make yourself at home.

24
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,954
# In the summertime,
when the weather is high #

25
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,825
# You can stretch right up
and touch the sky #

26
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,864
# When the weather's fine #

27
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,561
# You got women,
you got women on your mind #

28
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,603
# Have a drink, have a drive #

29
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,129
# Go out and see
what you can find #

30
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,473
# If her daddy's rich,
take her out for a meal #

31
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,274
# If her daddy's poor,
just do what you feel #

32
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:38,647
# Speed along the lake,
do a ton or a ton and 25 #

33
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,813
# When the sun goes down #

34
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,585
# You can make it,
make it good in a lay-by #

35
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,855
# We're not gray people,
we're not dirty, we're not mean #

36
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,419
# We love everybody,
but we do as we please #

37
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,465
# When the weather's fine #

38
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,162
# We go fishing or go sailing
in the sea #

39
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,364
# We're always happy #

40
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,136
# Life's for living,
yeah, that's our philosophy #

41
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,972
# Sing along with us #

42
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,170
# Dee-dee-dee dee-dee #

43
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,611
# Da-da da-da-da #

44
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,204
# Yeah, we're hap-happy #

45
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,079
# Da da da #

46
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,119
# Dee-da-doo
dee-da-doo da-doo da #

47
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,212
# Da-doo da-da-da #

48
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,190
# Da-da-da da-da #

49
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,250
# All right now... #

50
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:36,164
I

51
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,120
Cunt!
Goddamn cunt!

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,281
Cunt!
Goddamn cunt!

53
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,084
Fuck you and your
ultimate driving machine!

54
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,124
Perry.

55
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,522
Well, they are when they
drive like that.

56
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,151
Did you see the way
she just cut right in front of me?

57
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,752
Oh, are you talking to me?

58
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,059
Sorry, I was reading "The life
of Ray Charles." What happened?

59
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,259
Some asshole whore
cunt bitch dyke

60
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,733
with New Jersey
license plates

61
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,793
and Republican candidates
on her bumper

62
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,635
practically took my fender off
at 70 miles an hour.

63
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,165
Sounds like an extremely
cunt-like maneuver, Batman.

64
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,871
I think you're both
disgusting.

65
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,641
If I had any convictions,
I'd ask you to let me out right here.

66
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,444
I was mad.

67
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,280
Words only mean something
if you say them

68
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,286
and you're not mad
and mean them.

69
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,414
I agree, "Nancy Reagan is a cunt"
is an offensive remark.

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,957
I wouldn't go
that far, Bruce.

71
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,391
But "cunt" when she grabs
a cab in front of you

72
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,656
after you've been waiting 20 minutes
on a rainy night

73
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,290
and she just pops out
from Lutesse

74
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,857
is a justifiable
emotional response

75
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,335
to an enormous social injustice.

76
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,602
All I am saying is it's never right
to use words to hurt another person.

77
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,108
How did I hurt her?

78
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,474
She didn't hear me.

79
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,944
She's halfway
to Poughkeepsie by now,

80
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,412
the bitch!

81
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,006
Don't get me started.
I was just calming down.

82
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,779
We hurt ourselves
when we use them.

83
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,910
We're all diminished.

84
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,647
You're right.

85
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,180
I don't agree with you,
but you're right.

86
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,783
Of course I'm right...

87
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,829
you big fairy.

88
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,563
# Wilkommen, bienvenue #

89
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,368
# Welcome #

90
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,901
# Fremde, enchante #

91
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,675
# Stranger #

92
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,084
"Cabaret." Joel Grey.

93
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,178
The Broadhurst Theater.

94
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,985
1,165 performances,

95
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,686
and they don't write musicals
like that anymore.

96
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,465
Oh.

97
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,500
Sorry.

98
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,660
You looked like someone I could
have a little fun with

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,727
on my way to oblivion.

100
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,741
Oh, well.

101
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,369
Wake me when we get
to Glocamorra, will you, hmm?

102
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,676
# Au Cabaret, en Cabaret #

103
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,478
# To Cabaret! #

104
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,916
Do you ever wonder
what Gregory looks like?

105
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,619
Perry.

106
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,821
I know what
he looks like.

107
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,491
No, I mean what he
really looks like.

108
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,899
I know what he
really looks like.

109
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,631
He's handsome.

110
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:57,870
He has wonderful
green eyes that shine.

111
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,105
But you've never
seen green eyes.

112
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,874
You have
no concept of them.

113
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,712
In my mind's eye I do.

114
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,809
What do we look like?

115
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,148
Oh, Perry.

116
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,745
Like bookends.

117
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,351
Is that a compliment?

118
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,929
I think...

119
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,557
you love each other
very much.

120
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:26,469
I think you will stick it out,
whatever.

121
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,476
I think right now
you're holding hands.

122
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:37,847
I think that when Perry has
to take his hand from yours,

123
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,818
Arthur, to steer in traffic,

124
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,913
he puts it back in yours
as soon as he can.

125
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,891
I think this is how
you always drive.

126
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,654
I think...

127
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,425
this is how you
go through life.

128
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,816
Welcome to Shangri-La.

129
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,228
John.
Welcome back, stranger.

130
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,676
Remember, don't, um, mention, um,
his, um, stutter, um.

131
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,542
Now isn't this, um,
better than the, um, city?

132
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,707
What did I tell you?

133
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,772
Traffic was ghastly.

134
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,477
You need, um, a swim.

135
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,521
I need a-- ahem--
a drink.

136
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,682
This is Ramon,
Ramon Fornos.

137
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,523
I know. I saw, um, your company
performing at the, uh, Joyce.

138
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,584
You were terrific.

139
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,754
You saw us?

140
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,627
Yeah. Great, just great.

141
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,793
You, uh, swim
as well as you dance?

142
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,928
I don't do anything
as well as I dance.

143
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,132
Come on.
We'll, uh, both cool off.

144
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,767
John, we'll work this afternoon.

145
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,476
When I first bought this house,
people thought I was crazy.

146
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,387
It's in, um,
the middle of nowhere.

147
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,085
I like, uh,
the middle of nowhere.

148
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,988
How long have you
and John been...?

149
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,124
Uh, three weeks.

150
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,830
Our regular rehearsal
pianist was sick,

151
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,599
so John filled in.

152
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,306
Thanks for letting
him bring me.

153
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,869
Not at all.
I'm glad, uh, John's happy.

154
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,439
I don't, um, do this,
uh, on purpose, uh.

155
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,178
Oh, it's okay, Mr. Mitchell.

156
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,810
It's Gregory, please.

157
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,856
You'll make me feel like an old man
if you keep that up.

158
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,288
Sorry.

159
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,607
Whoo!

160
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,282
Bobby?

161
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:25,266
I

162
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,813
Oh, great, whoo!

163
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,613
That's disgusting.

164
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,884
What is?

165
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,791
What is? What is?
Reading someone's journal.

166
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,987
Did you just get here?

167
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,154
Yes. Where is Gregory?

168
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,027
They're swimming.
You alone?

169
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,896
No. I have Michael J. Fox
in here.

170
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,060
Are you?

171
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,434
No.

172
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,564
"Dancing gets
harder and harder.

173
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,040
I have pains in places
I didn't know I had..."

174
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,976
- Oh, I hate what you're doing.
- "The spirit is willing--"

175
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,070
If I thought for one second
that you read

176
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,343
anything I wrote when we were together,
I would kill you.

177
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,147
I'm puzzled.
What kind of statement about his work

178
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,120
do you think
a choreographer is making

179
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,020
by living with a blind person?

180
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,422
It's not a statement.

181
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,119
It's a relationship!

182
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,388
Remember them?

183
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,895
And at least
they have someone.

184
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,430
Speak for yourself.

185
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,728
All right, so you got lucky
this weekend. Don't rub it in.

186
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,098
What happened
to you and, uh--

187
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,263
Aah!
I got too intense for him.

188
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,669
That's my problem
with people.

189
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,037
I'm too intense
for them.

190
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,303
I need someone
like Dennis Hopper.

191
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,470
A cute, young,
gay Dennis Hopper.

192
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,377
In the meantime,
I am through with love

193
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,108
and all that it meant to me.

194
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,014
Right.

195
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,746
Perry's work for Gregory
is pro bono.

196
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,846
Arts advocacy is very in.

197
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,051
- He does my clinic, too.
- So is AlDS.

198
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,495
Sorry.

199
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,027
All right. That's $5.00.

200
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,066
What?

201
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,965
Anyone that mentions
AlDS this summer,

202
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,027
It's gonna cost 'em.
Cough it up.

203
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,072
Hello, we're back!

204
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,301
Put this away
and come downstairs.

205
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,206
I want to see this new
boyfriend of yours.

206
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,404
Oh, did I mention
he's a dancer?

207
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,281
I hate you.

208
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,715
I really hate you.

209
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,948
You don't know, um,
what you're missing, John!

210
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,615
The lake is, uh, wonderful.

211
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,057
Don't believe him.
It's freezing.

212
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,184
Oh, my.

213
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,252
Hello, hello,
hello, Gregory.

214
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,230
Hey, Buzz, welcome.

215
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,664
Buzz, this is Ramon.

216
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,201
Aah!

217
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,199
Mmm.

218
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,638
I am so sorry.

219
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,677
It's been such a long day for me.
How are you?

220
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,405
Hi, I'm Ramon.

221
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,571
Nice to meet you.

222
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,444
Oh, oh, oh, my.

223
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,952
Ho ho, ooh.

224
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,650
You're home, Bobby.

225
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,125
Well, that isn't bad.
2 1/2 hours door-to-door.

226
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,358
Whose car is that?
Are we expecting company?

227
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,993
Okay, John had nowhere to go,
so Gregory invited him.

228
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,036
John?

229
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,799
John Jeckyll?

230
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,569
No, no, no, no.

231
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,167
Didn't Gregory tell you
that he'd be here?

232
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,475
No, he did not.
Shit. Why would Greg do that to me?

233
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,378
Shh. He, uh, he didn't.

234
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,849
He told me.
I elected not to tell you.

235
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,284
Why?

236
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,752
Oh, why?

237
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,413
Perry has a problem
with John, Bobby.

238
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,321
I don't have
a problem with him.

239
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,758
I can't stand him,
and I wish he was dead.

240
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,089
He said he was
bringing someone.

241
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,129
A new boyfriend?

242
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,458
One of the Menendez
brothers?

243
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,624
Oh, you're really
over the top this afternoon.

244
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,894
Wait till the weekend's over.

245
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,369
Hello.
Where is everybody?

246
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,305
They're here.
Buzz, John, they're here.

247
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,934
Need a hand, Bobby?

248
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,878
I was beginning
to, um, worry. Hi.

249
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,213
Oh, that bus was horrendous.
I should've called for you.

250
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,479
A handshake?
What is this shit? I want a hug.

251
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,680
Where's my, um, angel?

252
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,382
Hey, John.

253
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,981
You both look terrific.

254
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,924
Don't you two put on
weight ever anywhere?

255
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,154
Oh, look who's talking.

256
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,059
Love to see the portrait
in his closet.

257
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,427
No, you wouldn't.

258
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,926
Ramon, Arthur
and, uh, Perry.

259
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,060
He's Arthur.
I'm Perry.

260
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,694
He's nice, I'm not. Hi.

261
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,705
Oh, now,
we're both nice.

262
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,866
Don't you listen to him.

263
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,240
Anyway...

264
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,677
So what are you boys
driving these days?

265
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,305
A Ford Taurus.

266
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,781
What do you care,
you big fruit?

267
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,717
That's a Volvo
740 Turbo, Buzz.

268
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,378
Oh, he's so butch.

269
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,047
Well, that's why
you married me.

270
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,283
- Can you change a tire?
- No.

271
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,450
Neither can l.

272
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,618
Aah! That's from
"Annie Get Your Gun."

273
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,653
"Can you bake a pie?"
"No." "Neither can l."

274
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,530
Ethel Merman was gay,
you know.

275
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,468
So was lrving Berlin.

276
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,528
Irving Berlin.

277
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,769
I don't think English is Ramon's
first language.

278
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,648
I missed you.

279
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,883
Oh, it's so good
to be here.

280
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,482
The city's awful.

281
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,221
You can't breathe.

282
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,990
Have you been working?

283
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,033
I didn't leave, um,
the studio, um, all week.

284
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,465
How'd it go?

285
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,661
Don't ask.

286
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,135
Terrible.

287
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,466
Ohh.

288
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,733
Hi, I'm Ramon.

289
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,037
Oh, I'm sorry.

290
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,738
Uh, Bobby doesn't,
um, see, Ramon.

291
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,247
Oh, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,044
Don't be sorry.
Just come here.

293
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,551
Welcome.

294
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,316
Ramon.
Is that Latino?

295
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,414
Yes.

296
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,187
Mi casa es su casa, huh?

297
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,752
I bet you were wishing I wasn't
going to say that.

298
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,458
We all were, Bobby.
We all were.

299
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:00,813
What room are you in?

300
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,781
What room are you in?

301
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,043
The little horror
under the eaves.

302
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,312
I call it the Patty Hearst
Memorial Closet.

303
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,978
Perry, give me a hand
with this, will you?

304
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,715
I told you not to bring
so much stuff.

305
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,051
Well, it's my hair dryer.

306
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,093
You don't have enough hair
to justify an appliance that size.

307
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,184
Has it ever occurred to you

308
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,388
I stopped listening to you
at least 10 years ago?

309
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,591
I hope you brought,
um, your swimsuits.

310
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,361
Hey, we don't need
swimsuits.

311
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,527
We're all going
skinny dipping after lunch.

312
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,797
What are we,
men or wimps?

313
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,304
You just want to see
everyone's dick.

314
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,737
Oh, I've seen
everyone's dick.

315
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,104
Answer the question.

316
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,166
Sometimes we're men,
and sometimes we're wimps.

317
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,677
And you haven't seen
Ramon's dick.

318
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,337
You are a troublemaker.

319
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,110
I am not a troublemaker.
I'm an imp.

320
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,810
A gay imp.

321
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,701
Gregory always
leaves Bobby alone like that?

322
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,294
That's their ritual.

323
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,034
Whenever he gets here,
he likes to be alone in the garden.

324
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,576
Greg, we need
some towels!

325
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,305
No, we don't. We brought
our own, remember?

326
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,778
Never mind!

327
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,839
Right. We hate his towels.

328
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,080
Try to be nice to John
for a change.

329
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,315
It's only three days.

330
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,721
Tell him not
to start with me.

331
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,954
It's usually
the other way around.

332
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,620
I don't know what
you're talking about.

333
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,958
Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,364
What did you think
of John's new friend?

335
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,527
He's all right, I guess.

336
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,900
Didn't really notice.

337
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,874
That'll be the day.

338
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,911
- Psst, Gregory.
- What?

339
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,811
John is on the phone
to his brother...

340
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,542
in London.

341
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,620
I didn't hear him use a credit card
or reverse the charges.

342
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,955
Um, I'm sure
he'll, um, tell me.

343
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,463
Don't you ever believe the worst
about anyone?

344
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,998
No.

345
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,863
Oh, fuck everything.

346
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:04,458
I

347
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,792
Who's that?

348
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,834
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,336
Ah.

350
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,666
You startled me.

351
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,229
It's Ramon. I'm sorry.

352
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:48,837
Uh, I was just, um,
thanking God for all this.

353
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,745
I didn't mean to interrupt
or anything.

354
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,877
I'm not crazy.
I'm happy.

355
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,080
I understand.

356
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,181
Yes.

357
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,521
I'll leave you alone.

358
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,458
Okay.

359
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,685
Hey, you want to go for a swim?

360
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,359
Want to go for a swim?

361
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,032
Oh-- oh, shit.

362
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,744
What's the matter?

363
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,715
My brother, he wants
to come over.

364
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,378
I didn't know
you had a brother.

365
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,579
Twin brother.
We're like that.

366
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,590
Ah, sounds like me and mine.

367
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,389
He's not well.

368
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,658
He needs me, and, uh...

369
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,495
I don't like him.

370
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:19,003
I, um...

371
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,539
work with quite a few
AlDS organizations.

372
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,471
Thank you.

373
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,978
They can help
him find a doctor.

374
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,173
Thank you.

375
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,648
It never ends.

376
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,687
No.

377
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,051
How does Buzz look to you?

378
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,751
I don't know.
How does he look to you?

379
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,987
I can't tell anymore.

380
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,858
He wouldn't tell me
if things were worse.

381
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,761
I can't look at him
sometimes.

382
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,627
Anyway...

383
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,672
You got that from me,
you know?

384
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,233
Got what?

385
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,404
The...

386
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,142
"anyway."

387
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,117
It's a word in the dictionary,
page 249.

388
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,619
You can't copyright
the English language, ducks.

389
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,985
Hey.

390
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,786
I'm trying.

391
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,191
Fuck you.

392
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,237
I can reach that, Arthur.

393
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,272
I'll get it.

394
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,897
I don't want
to get my shirt wet.

395
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,669
Please stop telling me
how to wash the car.

396
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:38,902
Arthur, you do the-- don't.

397
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,274
- I am serious.
- please.

398
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,336
Don't tell me how
to wash the car!

399
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,315
Oh, fuck. Jeez.

400
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,990
Buzz.

401
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,694
Dinner.

402
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:10,167
I was having a musical
comedy nightmare.

403
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,109
They were going to revive
"West Side Story"

404
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,409
with Robert Goulet and Cher.

405
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,847
We've got to stop them.

406
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,782
- Ooh.
- Come on.

407
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,376
Oh, thank you.

408
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,514
No, Gregory,
it's out of the question.

409
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,717
I'm not gonna do it,
and I'm not gonna let Arthur do it.

410
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,089
His master's voice.

411
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,422
It's for a good cause.

412
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,625
You are not going to find six serious,
respectable gay men,

413
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,793
non-dancers, all,
to put on tutus

414
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,430
and do "Swan Lake" for
another AlDS benefit at Carnegie Hall.

415
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,475
You're not gonna find
one decent gay man.

416
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,874
Speak for
yourself, Perry.

417
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:51,177
Well, you, the love child
of Judy Garland and Liberace.

418
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,682
When is it, Gregory?

419
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,945
Right after Labor Day.

420
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,887
I'm sorry, but men in drag
turn my stomach.

421
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,583
Honey, I wouldn't
put you in drag.

422
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,489
I'd have you in tulle.
Lots and lots of tulle.

423
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,687
You know what
I'm talking about.

424
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,423
Don't yell at him.
It was my idea.

425
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,556
I thought
it might be funny.

426
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,999
You've done enough for AlDS.
We all have.

427
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:17,435
Nobody's done enough,
um, for AlDS.

428
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,806
Never mind, Perry.

429
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,936
I'll ask someone else.

430
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,776
People are sick of benefits.

431
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:31,117
Especially the people
they're being given for.

432
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,193
Dinner was delicious.

433
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:36,361
Those mashed potatoes
are fabulous, Gregory.

434
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,421
Those mashed potatoes
are fabulous, Gregory.

435
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,727
- Oh yeah.
- The mashed potatoes were mine.

436
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,598
# Giving credit
where it's due #

437
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,536
# There is much
I like in you #

438
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,767
But it's also very true

439
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,071
that you're spoiled.

440
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,507
Well, I don't know why
I bother to perfect

441
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,675
a flawless imitation
of Gertrude Lawrence

442
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,514
when none of you cretins
have even heard of her.

443
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,814
We've heard, love.
We don't care.

444
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,286
Who's Gertrude Lawrence?

445
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,345
A British actress.

446
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,618
Julie Andrews made
a rotten film about her.

447
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,250
Isn't Julie Andrews gay?

448
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,887
I don't know.
She never fucked me. Don't interrupt.

449
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,794
Who's Julie Andrews?

450
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,459
I suppose I should have
seen that one coming.

451
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,265
I was born in the wrong decade.
That's my problem.

452
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,102
- Who's got the milk?
- Who's Ethel Merman?

453
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,732
Who's Mary Martin?
Who is anyone?

454
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,970
We're all gonna be dead
and forgotten soon anyway.

455
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,034
Gregory's not.

456
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,479
I know who
Barbra Streisand is.

457
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,947
She'll be very pleased
to hear that.

458
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,612
You admit people like
Gertrude Lawrence don't really matter.

459
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,621
I cannot believe that
a subject of the UK

460
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,350
would even make
a comment like that.

461
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,449
I have United States
citizenship.

462
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,050
When did you take out
US citizenship?

463
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,562
Nine years ago,
October 25.

464
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,495
Barbara Cook's birthday.

465
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,725
Who's Barbara Cook?

466
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,267
No one, nobody.
Forget it.

467
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,667
Die listening
to your Madonna albums.

468
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,571
I long for the day when somebody says,
"Who's Madonna?"

469
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,871
I apologize to the teenagers
at the table.

470
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,005
The state
of the American musical

471
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,606
has me very upset.

472
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,879
It's the state of America
that should have you upset.

473
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,319
It does.

474
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,379
It's a metaphor, you asshole.

475
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,856
Now, just a minute.

476
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,825
I have a picture
of a starving child in Somalia

477
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,327
over my desk at the clinic.

478
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,828
It doesn't justify
you calling me--

479
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,728
Five feet away,
a vulture sits and waits.

480
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,664
Just sits and waits.
He's not even looking at the kid.

481
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,599
He's that certain
where his next meal is coming from.

482
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,897
We've all seen the picture, Buzz.

483
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,232
Not like this kid
is going to get up

484
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,966
and launch into some number
from "Oliver!"

485
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,201
- Or "Porgy and Bess."
- We've all seen the picture.

486
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,102
I haven't.

487
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,244
So what is your point?

488
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,843
My point?

489
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,321
I don't have a point.

490
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,086
Why does everything
have to have a point?

491
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,354
I sit, and I look
at that picture every day,

492
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,861
And I get sick
to my stomach,

493
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,364
and sometimes
I cry a little bit, and so what?

494
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,865
So fucking what?

495
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,334
That kid is probably
dead meat by now anyway.

496
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,997
I think the point is
we're all sitting around here

497
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,801
talking about something,
pretending to care.

498
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,809
- No one's pretending.
- Pretending to care...

499
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,812
because the truth is there's nothing
we can do about it.

500
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,350
That kid is a picture
in a newspaper

501
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,512
who makes us feel bad
for having it so good.

502
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,818
But feed him,
brush him off,

503
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,916
and in 10 years, he's just another
nigger to scare the shit out of us.

504
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,331
Apologies tendered,
but that's how I see it.

505
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,299
Apologies not accepted.

506
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,801
You'd rather I dissembled?

507
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,804
Yes, I would.

508
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,602
I'd rather the man
I shared my life with

509
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,834
and love
with all my heart--

510
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,672
I'd rather he dissembled

511
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,507
than let me see the hate
and bile there.

512
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,513
The hate and bile
aren't for you, love.

513
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,310
Well, that's not
good enough, Perry.

514
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,511
After a while, the hate and bile
are for everyone.

515
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,282
It all comes around.

516
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,791
Anyway...

517
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,362
I hate that word.

518
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,364
You use it to get yourself out
of every tight corner

519
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,525
you've ever found
yourself in.

520
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,837
Shall I load the washer?

521
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,841
Um, just rinse and stack.

522
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,274
Thank you, Arthur.

523
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,776
Need a hand?

524
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,540
No, thank you.

525
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:18,883
As a person of color,
I think you're full of shit.

526
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,511
As a person of color,
I think you're full of shit.

527
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,884
As a gay man, I think--

528
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,983
No one cares what you think
as a gay man, ducks.

529
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,056
I think the problem
begins right here.

530
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,223
The way we relate
to one another as gay men.

531
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,267
This is tired, Ramon.

532
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,268
- Very, very tired.
- I don't think it is.

533
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,463
We don't love one another
'cause we don't love ourselves.

534
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,527
Cliches.
Cliches.

535
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,403
Where's the love
at this table?

536
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,237
I wanna see the love
at this table.

537
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,278
I love Gregory.

538
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,971
I love Bobby.

539
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,108
I love Arthur.

540
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,885
I love Gregory.

541
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,751
I love Bobby.

542
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,981
I love Buzz.

543
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,162
Well, I certainly don't love

544
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,425
anyone at this table
right now.

545
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,132
All right.

546
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,831
Bobby and Gregory
a little bit.

547
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,873
But only because
they're our hosts.

548
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,602
None of you said yourself.

549
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,576
Maybe it goes without saying.

550
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,409
We were waiting for you,
Ramon.

551
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,039
How do you love yourself?

552
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,743
Let us count the ways.

553
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,911
I love myself.

554
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,579
I love myself
when I dance.

555
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,088
That's one.

556
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,818
I love myself when I'm making love
with a really hot man.

557
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,485
Mmm!

558
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,394
I love myself when I'm eating
really good food.

559
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,659
I love myself
when I'm swimming naked.

560
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,961
That's four.

561
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,901
The rest of the time
I just feel okay.

562
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,267
I'm jealous.

563
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,067
We don't reach
such an apotheosis

564
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,301
at the law firm of Caan, Mendelson,
& Cronenberg.

565
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,209
But most of all,
I love myself when I'm dancing well

566
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,678
and no one can touch me.

567
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,181
Yes, this is a gay dance,
huh, chiquita?

568
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,682
Fuck you, John!

569
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,343
That's right, sweetheart,
you tell him.

570
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,386
Fuck you, John!

571
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,353
Americans
use that expression

572
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,014
entirely too often.

573
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,057
Hmmph. Everyone?

574
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,116
Fuck you, John!

575
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,559
In England we think it
nearly as often as you do,

576
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,530
but we don't actually
say it to someone's face.

577
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,861
It would be too rude.

578
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,925
Fuck you!

579
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,367
What do you mean

580
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,304
when you tell
another person, "Fuck you"?

581
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,533
Fuck you,

582
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,872
and don't you ever call me
chiquita again!

583
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,036
This is good.

584
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,544
I think it means
several things--

585
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,173
mixed signals I believe they're called
in therapeutic circles.

586
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,843
I hate you,
get out of my life.

587
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,148
At least, I hate you,
get out of my life for the moment.

588
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,552
I love you,
but you don't love me.

589
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,150
I want to make you feel
small and insignificant,

590
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,386
The way you've made
me feel.

591
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,329
I want to make you feel
every terrible thing my entire life,

592
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,662
right up until this moment,
has made me feel.

593
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,668
I said fuck you!

594
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,365
Well, I say fuck you
right back,

595
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,897
with every last fiber
of my fading British being,

596
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,412
every last ounce
of my tobaccoed English breath.

597
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,174
Fuck you, Ramon.

598
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,010
Fuck all of you.

599
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,515
Well...

600
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,689
I think I've said my peace.

601
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,873
What brought that on?

602
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,876
His brother.

603
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,878
That's no excuse.

604
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,381
Play something, John!

605
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,882
Something gay!

606
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,351
We want gay music
by a gay composer.

607
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,888
There's no such thing
as gay music, Buzz.

608
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,015
Well, maybe there should be.

609
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,184
I am sick to death
of straight people.

610
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,386
Tell the truth.
Aren't you?

611
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,895
There's just too goddamned
many of them.

612
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,398
I was in a bank the other day.
They were everywhere--

613
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,900
writing checks,
making deposits.

614
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,732
Two of them were applying
for a mortgage.

615
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,771
It was disgusting.

616
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,296
They're taking over.

617
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,842
No one wants to talk about it,
but it's true.

618
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,846
I like this.

619
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,508
It's not Jerry Herman,
but it's got a beat.

620
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,390
I don't have a complaint.

621
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,858
Yeah, I know.

622
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,862
Ah.

623
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,795
What the hell is it?

624
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,832
Ow.

625
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,164
Hey, it's not--
it's not funny.

626
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,292
I

627
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,940
I brought you a sweater.

628
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,385
The stars are incredible.

629
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,387
Thick as...

630
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,888
whatever stars
are thick as.

631
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,890
Molasses doesn't sound right.

632
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,325
Thieves?
No. No.

633
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,800
I love you.

634
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,633
I know. Me too.

635
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:12,335
I'm sorry we don't always
understand each other.

636
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,878
I hate it when we're not
in synch.

637
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,315
I hate what I said at the table.

638
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,875
I hated it, too.

639
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,319
I just get so...

640
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,152
frightened sometimes.

641
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,557
So angry.

642
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,864
It's all right, Perry.

643
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,729
We all do.

644
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,666
Don't give up on me.

645
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,137
No.

646
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,387
It's incredible.

647
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,324
I can see Orion's belt

648
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:07,660
and both Dippers.

649
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,030
So many stars.

650
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,037
So many stars.

651
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,570
Say a prayer for Buzz.

652
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,988
Well, children,

653
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,819
this has been
a magical night,

654
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,358
but I must retire

655
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,360
to the second-floor
bedroom...

656
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,827
in the rear...

657
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,864
no lock on the door.

658
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,333
Welcome at all hours.
I take all comers.

659
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,528
Good night, Buzz.

660
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,366
I am going up, too.

661
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,871
Is everything okay?

662
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,340
We're fine.
I'll be up.

663
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,570
Welcome, Ramon.

664
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,743
Good night.

665
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,654
John.

666
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,757
You all right?

667
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,531
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,603
It's this business
with my brother.

669
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,975
It's okay.

670
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,139
I'm glad you're here.

671
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,448
Good night.

672
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,294
You still there?

673
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,062
Yes.

674
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,843
What are you doing?

675
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,379
Nothing.

676
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,490
No.

677
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,526
No. No. No.

678
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,536
Ohh.

679
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,003
Don't. Don't.

680
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,165
Stop. Please.

681
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,523
Go, go, go.

682
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,923
I'll clean it up.
Go ahead.

683
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,077
Hi.

684
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,805
Good night.

685
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,049
What happened?

686
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,956
Oh, be careful.

687
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,494
There might
be broken glass.

688
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,462
Oh, I'm okay.
I'm wearing slippers.

689
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,998
There,
I think I got it all.

690
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,658
Oh, you cut yourself.
Now sit.

691
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,201
- No, I'm fine.
- Sit.

692
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,827
I'm... I'm...
Okay.

693
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,980
Where were you?

694
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,017
I couldn't sleep.

695
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,881
I missed you.

696
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,158
I said...

697
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,023
I missed you.

698
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,527
I heard you.

699
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,961
Shh.

700
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,591
Go back to sleep.

701
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,102
What are you doing?

702
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,040
I, uh...

703
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,949
I guess you should know.

704
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,683
There's a rather obvious stain
on your pajamas.

705
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,654
I didn't know I could
still blush at my age.

706
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,994
Your secret's safe with me.

707
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,001
I, uh...

708
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,004
I had sort
of an accident.

709
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,734
I hope you both did.

710
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,638
You know what we used
to call them

711
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,012
back in Catholic boys'
school?

712
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,983
Nocturnal emissions.

713
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,020
It always--

714
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,850
always made me think
of Chopin.

715
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:42,415
Nocturnal Emission
in C-Sharp Minor.

716
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,758
Come on.

717
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,035
I don't want Greg to know.

718
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,536
I swear to God,

719
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,539
I only came down here
for a glass of milk.

720
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,474
I swear to God
I did, too.

721
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,981
Is he attractive?

722
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,348
I'm not supposed
to notice things like that.

723
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,011
I'm in a relationship.

724
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,489
So am l.

725
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,990
Is he?

726
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,553
I think the word
is hot, Bobby, okay?

727
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,996
Ah, I love these stairs.
They're so easy.

728
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,034
Everyone says that.

729
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:24,156
I

730
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,468
Have you ever...

731
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,441
on Perry?

732
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,015
Uh, yes...

733
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,847
and I don't recommend it.

734
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,990
Did he find out?

735
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,026
Well, no.

736
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,028
I told him.

737
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:56,032
And it's never been the same.

738
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,829
It's, uh-- it's terrific.

739
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,096
It's just not the same.

740
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,338
Don't fuck up.

741
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,016
Oh, you are so...

742
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,156
He's not that hot,
Bobby.

743
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,818
No one is.

744
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,986
I know.

745
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,690
Thanks.
Good night.

746
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,495
Are you all right?

747
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:03,465
Shhhh.

748
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,502
Go to sleep.

749
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,972
I missed you.

750
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,473
Shh.

751
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,305
Shh.

752
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:22,151
Te quiero,
Ramon Fornos.

753
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,584
Te quiero,

754
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,772
4th of July weekend.

755
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,468
Promise of good weather.

756
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,875
After Memorial Day,

757
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,879
we deserve it.

758
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,472
I've been stuck for weeks
on the new piece.

759
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,984
It isn't coming as easily
as I thought it would.

760
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,485
Ready?

761
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,990
Bobby and I have spent most of June
working in the garden.

762
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,490
I'm always amazed

763
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,824
at how quickly things
get overgrown if you don't.

764
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:39,863
Hello.

765
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,488
# La... #

766
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,499
Buzz arrived alone again.

767
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,001
We were hoping
he'd bring someone.

768
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,630
He seems to be doing better
on his new medicine.

769
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:03,609
John Jeckyll is arriving with his
twin brother James...

770
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,621
who came over
from London

771
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,953
to participate in the trial
drug protocol.

772
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,755
A weekend in the country
will do him good.

773
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,457
Perry has
already dubbed them

774
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,930
James the Fair

775
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,126
and John the Foul.

776
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,474
Good morning, everybody.

777
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,974
Smile for the camera.

778
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,978
John asked to bring
Ramon Fornos again.

779
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,981
To say Ramon made an impression
on all of us the last time

780
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,483
would be putting it mildly.

781
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,644
Meet me on the raft.

782
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,654
Was I ever that young?

783
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,451
I don't remember.

784
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,459
Hello there.
Good morning, sunshine.

785
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,961
Perry and Arthur asked

786
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,156
if they could celebrate
their anniversary with us.

787
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,462
Say hi. Say hi, honey.
Come on, you look so pretty.

788
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,764
I warned them
John would be here.

789
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,804
Poor John.

790
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,243
People don't like him.

791
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,483
- Good try.
- Okay.

792
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,348
Whoa.
Good serve, Perry.

793
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,909
Come on, Buzz. Yeah!

794
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,956
It's all right, hon.

795
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,992
Way to go, Buzz.
Good try. Good effort.

796
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,026
Your serve.

797
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,426
You don't catch the ball.

798
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,521
All right.

799
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,225
- Good set.
- Oh, it's ESPN.

800
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,165
Get it off my--

801
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,634
you're supposed
to cover that spot.

802
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,965
It's all right.

803
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,403
Jesus.

804
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,906
Perry, get up.

805
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,568
Come on, now,
let's be good sports.

806
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,975
Perry.

807
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,103
Whoop.

808
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,840
# Go, Perry, go #

809
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,610
# Go, Perry... #

810
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,980
Come on, Buzz!

811
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,109
What? No.

812
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,948
It's all ri--
now, honey, come on.

813
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,283
You have to hit the ball!

814
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,915
- We're gonna take your toys away.
- What?

815
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,356
Why are you
running up like that?

816
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,360
- You-- I'm gonna...
- What?

817
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,690
Let's go. Come on.

818
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,458
That's two serving 12.

819
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,862
Let's go.

820
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,163
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!

821
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,398
You run like a girl, Perry.

822
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,438
Oh!

823
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,473
Ooh! Are you okay?

824
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,632
Uh-huh.

825
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,676
That's it!
Change partners!

826
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,176
You show him, Gregory.

827
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,304
Oh-ho, honey.

828
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,814
Oh ho!
Don't do this!

829
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,316
You're traumatizing me!

830
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,443
Oh, I'm back
in the sixth grade.

831
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,147
Coach Reardon's
gym class.

832
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,620
Nobody wants me
on their side.

833
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,089
It's the exact moment

834
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,955
I became
a raving homosexual.

835
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,756
Oh! Oh! Oh,
it's all so vivid still!

836
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,421
Oh! Oh ho ho!

837
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,794
Here, Buzz.

838
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,426
Make a V with your,
uh, forearms.

839
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,969
Like this.

840
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,470
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

841
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,973
You see how I respond
to basic human kindness?

842
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,975
Oh, why can't you
have a twin brother?

843
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,806
Where are all
the eligible men?

844
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,368
There are no eligible men!

845
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,507
Will you keep
your voice down?

846
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,983
Why? We're in the middle
of nowhere.

847
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,987
Keep my voice down?!

848
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,888
You're a martyr, Arthur,
a genuine martyr.

849
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,983
I hear Ramon's eligible.

850
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,994
Oh, no, no.
I don't date dancers.

851
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,996
It's very simple.
I've made it a rule.

852
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,123
Dancers don't want to date me,
so fuck 'em.

853
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,065
All right, what's the score,
1000 to one?

854
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,830
I'm really getting into this.

855
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,598
Are we playing or what?

856
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,765
Here, Perry. Your serve.

857
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,775
Now getting ready
to serve,

858
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,334
the ever lovely
Dr. Renee Richards.

859
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,145
Out.

860
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:33,530
Tea time.
Tea time.

861
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,896
Tea time.
Tea time.

862
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,457
- Oh, hiya.
- Tea time!

863
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,332
Hey, Buzz, which one
of them is it?

864
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,464
It must be James.
The grass isn't turning brown.

865
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,067
- Just in time, James.
- Mmm.

866
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,011
- Mmm.
- Ooh.

867
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,515
Arthur.

868
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,644
My brother gave me
the most extraordinary book.

869
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,315
"Queer America--
from A to Zed."

870
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,620
Am I in it?

871
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:05,991
It gives the names of all the gay men
and lesbians in this country.

872
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,032
Every one from...

873
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,067
Pocahontas...

874
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:14,467
right up to someone called...
Dan Rather?

875
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,598
# You say "Raw-ther,"
and I say "Ra-ther" #

876
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,767
# Let's call
the whole thing off. #

877
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,107
Oh God,
that ridiculous book.

878
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,409
I bet they've even got
Charlton Heston in there.

879
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,381
I must say,
for a young country,

880
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,509
you've turned out
almost as many poofters

881
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,110
in two and a half centuries
as we have in 20.

882
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,349
Oh, thank you.
We try.

883
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:34,113
I

884
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,195
Hello?

885
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,196
Anyone aboard?

886
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,403
Ramon.

887
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:21,328
I waited for you last night.
I thought you'd come down.

888
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,898
I can't do this.

889
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,443
Meet me
somewhere tonight.

890
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,341
Bobby, come in!

891
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,713
Telephone,
long distance.

892
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,546
They're calling me.

893
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,055
I'll be in the garden after 7:00.

894
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,393
Not the garden.

895
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,122
Boathouse.

896
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,916
What,
John didn't tell you?

897
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,316
- No.
- Ah.

898
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,879
Well, it was when he first came
to this country, short and sweet,

899
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,584
six months, tops.

900
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,957
I'm sorry.
What happened?

901
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,293
Oh, we were both so young.

902
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,390
I was too needy
and he wasn't needy enough.

903
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,670
I don't think John
can love anyone.

904
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,070
Now you tell me.

905
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,507
Perhaps one of us had better

906
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,704
swim out there
and tell Ramon.

907
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,576
I think
you should break it to him.

908
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,308
I don't think I'm his type.

909
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,350
I don't think either of us is.

910
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,111
I enjoy looking though.

911
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,058
Is there a British equivalent
for machismo?

912
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,422
No, none at all.

913
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,155
Maybe Glenda Jackson.

914
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:02,971
Well, this tea
is not doing it for me.

915
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,304
Can I bring you
a real drink down?

916
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,644
An ice cold martini,

917
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,739
very dry with a twist.

918
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,443
Is that gonna be
good for you?

919
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,816
Absolutely terrible.

920
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:38,508
Here.

921
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,601
Here.

922
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,201
All right,
it's right here.

923
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,974
Thanks.
Thank you.

924
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,552
Hello?

925
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,109
What?

926
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,559
Yeah, I can't hear you.
You have to speak up.

927
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,321
What?

928
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:12,473
We don't have sun
like this in England.

929
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,033
If we did,
we'd be much nicer people.

930
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,976
Shh.

931
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,447
"Swan Lake."

932
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,177
My blood just ran cold.

933
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,378
You're serious about
that goddamn benefit.

934
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:25,318
Of course I'm--
I'm serious.

935
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,618
That's all we need--
a picture of you

936
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:31,650
Iooking like some flaming fairy
in the Arts and Leisure section.

937
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,663
Men in drag give the rest of us
a bad name.

938
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:38,064
I have terrible news.

939
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:41,228
"The Fantastics"
is closing!

940
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,762
Whoo!

941
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,331
-Oh, come on, buzz!
- What?

942
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,899
You know
goddamn well what!

943
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,468
No. What? This?

944
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,081
Put some clothes on.
No one wants to look at that.

945
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,175
That?

946
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:59,153
You are referring
to my body as that?

947
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,213
Tell him, Arthur.
It's not bothering me.

948
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,156
Thank you, Arthur.

949
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:06,059
It's nice to know that Sharon Stone
has not lived entirely in vain.

950
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,096
What brought this on?

951
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,529
Nothing brought this on.

952
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,035
Some people do things
spontaneously!

953
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,732
It's a beautiful day.
The sun feels good.

954
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:20,071
I may not be around
next summer, all right?

955
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,043
This is how I look, Perry.

956
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,910
Love me,
love my love handles!

957
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,949
None of us
may be around next summer.

958
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,879
What do you think
you're doing?

959
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,648
Oh, calm down, Perry.

960
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,916
I can't believe you actually
lived through the '60s.

961
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,720
We only read about 'em in Kansas.
I'm less uptight than you are.

962
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:40,559
Leo, I could walk around
like that too if I wanted to.

963
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,063
Who's stopping you?

964
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,999
I just don't want to.

965
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,366
She's got it.
By George, she's got it.

966
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,462
Whoo!
I give up.

967
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,302
I hope your dick
gets a sunburn.

968
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,706
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

969
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,905
Thank you very much.

970
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,014
Bobby?

971
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,754
Bobby? Bobby?

972
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:16,230
What is it?
Are you all right?

973
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,426
Bobby.

974
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,205
Come on, baby.

975
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,074
Hey...

976
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,138
Give me a hand.

977
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,706
All right,
I'll race you back in.

978
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,947
No, I just got here.
Give me a hand.

979
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,182
You think I should be
trusting my lover

980
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,487
skinny-dipping with a horny
Puerto Rican modern dancer?

981
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,755
It depends on what
makes you suspicious.

982
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,662
Horny, Puerto Rican,
modern or dancer?

983
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,358
All of them.

984
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,367
How long have you two
been together?

985
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:55,233
14 years...

986
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,602
-...today.
- Oh!

987
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,504
We're role models.

988
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,167
It's very stressful.

989
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,014
John, what--
what's the matter?

990
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,845
Bobby's sister.

991
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,442
There's been an accident.

992
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,585
Ow!

993
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,750
Ow.

994
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:20,353
You had a fly on you.

995
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,958
You know, you got a nice ass
for somebody your age.

996
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,059
Thank you.

997
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,400
So do you.

998
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:33,942
What?

999
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,773
Have a nice ass.

1000
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,609
Oh, you mean
for someone my age?

1001
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,014
No, for someone any age.

1002
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,790
What?

1003
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:48,846
No!

1004
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,859
Hey, hey! Hey!

1005
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,485
God!

1006
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,060
Goddamn it.

1007
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,327
I'm so sorry.

1008
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,766
It's all right.

1009
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,030
It's all right.

1010
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,662
Shh.

1011
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,936
It's okay, it's okay.

1012
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,242
It's all right.

1013
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,678
It's all right.
It's all right.

1014
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,288
Some sort of a ride
at a fair in lndia.

1015
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,382
Some sort of a ride
at a fair in lndia.

1016
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,949
Some sort of swing thing
collapsed.

1017
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,189
I couldn't get
the whole story.

1018
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:31,063
Is she...?

1019
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,762
Poor lamb.

1020
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,543
Thank you.

1021
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,907
It's hot.

1022
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,304
How is he?

1023
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,612
He's, uh, all right.

1024
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,845
You know, we'll go.

1025
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,355
Oh, no, no, no.

1026
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,325
He wants you to stay.

1027
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:22,312
I remember when Gregory
bought this place.

1028
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,376
I was dead against it.

1029
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,922
No one for miles
and miles.

1030
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,488
We could be the last
eight people on earth.

1031
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,229
That's a frightening thought.

1032
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,497
Not if you're with
the right eight people.

1033
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:49,005
At times I wish
you could see me.

1034
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,813
See me looking at you.

1035
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,544
The love there.

1036
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,517
Uh, I'm not...

1037
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,991
I know.

1038
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:15,768
I know this is a terrible thing to say right
now, but...

1039
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,608
I am so happy, Bobby.

1040
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,203
Thank you, God, for him.

1041
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,261
You know how we tell
each other everything,

1042
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,526
even when it's hard?

1043
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,396
Yes.

1044
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,701
Memorial Day weekend.

1045
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,570
Yes?

1046
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,202
Ramon and l--

1047
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,643
Don't, Bobby.

1048
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,181
- We made love.
- Don't.

1049
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,649
I didn't want it to happen,

1050
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,916
but it did.

1051
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:14,028
Have you, um, um...

1052
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,724
did you, uh...

1053
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,392
do you, uh,
want to again?

1054
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:21,665
No, I'm with you.

1055
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,305
You leave tonight.

1056
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:32,973
I don't want you
in our house.

1057
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,607
Where are you going?

1058
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,710
Don't, um, come, um,

1059
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,914
with me.

1060
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,485
It's back.

1061
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,157
That was brief.

1062
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,740
- Arthur, discard.
- Okay.

1063
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,643
Go. Will you go?

1064
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,686
I'm going, I'm going.

1065
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:29,270
The door is still closed.

1066
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,704
You were right, honey.
We should have left.

1067
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:34,402
Here he is.

1068
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:37,403
That's him.

1069
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,573
I'd swear on
my mother's life.

1070
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,107
And I once had sex with the ghost
of Troy Donahue.

1071
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,155
Wait a minute, first you said he was
the model for Calvin Klein's Obsession.

1072
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,689
I can't keep
all those names straight,

1073
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,486
but I'll not forget a face
and a body like that.

1074
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,256
And you found this person
sleeping adrift on a fishing boat?

1075
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,958
Yes. You ever been to Greece?
There are a lot of fishing boats.

1076
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,467
- And you made love to him?
- Not in the fishing boat.

1077
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,833
It started to rain.
Found sort of a cave.

1078
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:04,532
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1079
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,734
Oh, this is very
Dido and Aeneas.

1080
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,470
Fuck you, all of you.
I don't care.

1081
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:09,909
The next time
you see his picture,

1082
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,674
you're tossing in bed
thinking about him,

1083
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,374
just remember,
somebody had him,

1084
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,280
and it wasn't you.

1085
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,216
Ooh.

1086
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:18,878
Ramon, Ramon, Ramon.

1087
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,056
Do you think
he's telling the truth?

1088
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,683
No.

1089
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:29,929
Do you?

1090
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:36,170
Probably got
a rotten personality.

1091
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:48,113
I know how we can have
a lot of fun.

1092
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,549
Sit down.

1093
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,181
Did you lock the door?

1094
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,158
It's locked. Sit.

1095
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,333
Put your hands
behind your back,

1096
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,869
feet apart,

1097
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,430
head down,

1098
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,773
ready for interrogation,

1099
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:19,303
my beautiful bound prisoner.

1100
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,245
Look at me.

1101
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,380
You look so beautiful
like that,

1102
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,754
I think I could come
without even touching you.

1103
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,952
Let me go.

1104
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,053
No.

1105
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,998
Please, the rope,
it's too tight.

1106
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,227
My wrists.

1107
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,428
Go on.

1108
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:41,936
Struggle.

1109
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:43,996
Shh.

1110
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,131
I can't get loose.

1111
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,902
Look at me.

1112
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:51,112
You don't take
your eyes from mine.

1113
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,146
Who do you see?

1114
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,243
Who do you wish I were?

1115
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,482
- No, I won't tell you.
- Yes, you will.

1116
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,683
Who?

1117
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,727
Look at me.

1118
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,861
Who?

1119
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,694
Who do you wish I were?

1120
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:11,790
Kiss me.

1121
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,732
Gag me with your mouth.

1122
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,534
Come on, baby.

1123
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,701
Who do you see?

1124
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,269
Who do you want in this chair?

1125
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,047
I don't know.

1126
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,519
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.

1127
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:33,953
Who do you see?

1128
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,786
Come on, tell me.
It's okay, John.

1129
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:36,825
I can't.

1130
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,325
Come on, baby, who?

1131
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,486
Don't make me.

1132
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,052
I can't make
you do anything.

1133
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,030
I'm your fucking
prisoner, man.

1134
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:46,159
You have me tied up
here, gagged.

1135
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,499
Ohh.

1136
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,803
Ohh.

1137
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:57,005
His name was Padrick,
the lrish spelling.

1138
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,512
Fuck the spelling.

1139
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:05,618
Padrick Boyle.

1140
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,521
He was 17 years old.
I was 19.

1141
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,422
I hear you.
17 and 19.

1142
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,327
100 bottles of beer on the wall,
100 bottles of beer...

1143
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,365
Shut up. Shut up.

1144
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,798
He worked for us.

1145
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,358
We owned a fleet of coaches.

1146
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,199
Padrick and his father
washed them,

1147
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,932
but that didn't matter.
We were friends.

1148
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,871
He liked me.
I know he liked me.

1149
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,340
Cut to the chase.

1150
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,571
Cut to what chase?
There wasn't any chase.

1151
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:30,942
Get to the good part.

1152
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,173
It's all a good part.

1153
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,876
Get to the sex.
One night and day.

1154
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:39,387
We started...

1155
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,047
wrestling.

1156
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:45,150
Suddenly Padrick
put his hand...

1157
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,424
down there,
and he could feel I was hard.

1158
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,125
And he said...

1159
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,861
"What is this?

1160
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:56,632
What the bloody hell
is this, mate?"

1161
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,639
He took off my belt,

1162
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:03,701
wrapped it
around my wrists...

1163
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,804
he raised my arms
over my head

1164
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:10,841
and hung them to a hook
along the wall.

1165
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,888
Then he unfastened
my trousers

1166
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:16,618
and let them drop
to my ankles.

1167
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,717
He undressed himself,

1168
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,262
Took a chair like this one,

1169
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,163
and sat in it.

1170
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,703
Then he looked right at me.

1171
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,765
Didn't move, not even
the slightest undulation of his hips.

1172
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,710
And then he came,

1173
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:44,481
and all he let out
was this one soft "uhh."

1174
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:49,513
- What did he say?
- Uhh.

1175
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,288
After a while
he opened his eyes,

1176
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,159
stood up,

1177
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,964
and kissed me lightly
on the lips.

1178
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:03,402
No man had ever
kissed me before.

1179
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:13,345
My heart stopped beating.

1180
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,714
He was going to tell me
he loved me,

1181
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:21,813
but instead he said,
"I've doused this place with petrol.

1182
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,190
I'm lighting a match. You have
three minutes to get out alive.

1183
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:27,627
Good luck, 007."

1184
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:32,799
Then he laughed
and walked out, whistling.

1185
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:39,067
He never wanted to play again.

1186
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:45,105
Last time I saw him,
he was overweight,

1187
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,412
father of four, and still
washing our coaches.

1188
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:56,181
But that's who
I still see there

1189
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,056
every time.

1190
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:13,838
And that's why we hate
the bloody lrish.

1191
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,272
Sorry. Can l, um,
get in there a sec?

1192
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,713
Sure.

1193
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,121
Um, uh, sorry.

1194
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,957
I need to, um,
get a suitcase for Bobby.

1195
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,090
How is he?

1196
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:42,437
He's going home.

1197
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:51,812
Was it in there?

1198
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,179
No. Wrong closet.

1199
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,780
Do you mind if we don't...

1200
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,823
Suit yourself.

1201
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,663
I'm not Padrick.

1202
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,832
And I'm not Bobby.

1203
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,670
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1204
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,283
You son of a bitch.

1205
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,224
It was his idea.
I had nothing to do with it.

1206
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,284
I'm sorry, John.
It was a joke.

1207
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:43,559
You scum, you cunt,
you piece of shit!

1208
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,657
I will get down
on my knees to you.

1209
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,224
How dare you?
How fucking dare you?

1210
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:54,572
I hope you get
what my brother has.

1211
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,508
I hope you die from it.

1212
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,411
When I read or hear that
you have, then, Perry,

1213
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,644
then will I forgive you.

1214
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:13,028
I

1215
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:18,694
Well, so much for the unsafe
exchange of body fluids.

1216
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:22,635
Boy, I would like
to flatten that limey motherfucker.

1217
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,866
You know,
I'm tired of "limey."

1218
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,670
Aren't there any other hateful words
for those ass-licking,

1219
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:30,439
cock-sucking,
motherfucking, shit-eating

1220
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,379
descendants of Shakespeare,
Shelley and Keats?

1221
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,349
Okay, honey, let's drop it,
all right?

1222
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,885
He is just lucky
I am a big queen.

1223
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,818
One thing
you are not, Arthur,

1224
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,288
and never will be,
is a big queen.

1225
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,590
I know.

1226
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,061
I'm butch.

1227
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,690
I can-- I can
catch a ball.

1228
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:55,931
I genuinely like
both my parents.

1229
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:59,201
I hate opera.

1230
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:02,641
I don't know why
I bother being gay.

1231
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,006
Oh, God.

1232
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,323
Where did that come from?

1233
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,484
Happy anniversary.

1234
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,758
Are we okay?

1235
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,923
We're fine.

1236
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,660
14 years.

1237
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,259
Make you feel old?

1238
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,238
No, lucky.

1239
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,570
How did we manage?

1240
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,542
We wanted to manage.

1241
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:39,337
I haven't been perfect.

1242
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,941
Well, I've been perfect.

1243
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,421
Sure, you have.

1244
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:54,553
I thought you were the most wonderful
looking man I'd ever seen.

1245
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,928
Did you really think that?

1246
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,627
Uh-huh.

1247
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,532
Ow!

1248
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,264
Sorry.

1249
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:06,466
When was the last time
I did this?

1250
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,169
Just don't make a face.

1251
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:10,006
I am not making a face.

1252
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,876
I can hear it
in your voice.

1253
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,411
I wouldn't do this
for anyone but you.

1254
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,282
You know,
if you really think about it,

1255
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:23,790
this is what
it all comes down to.

1256
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:26,988
What?

1257
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,929
Trimming the hair
in your boyfriend's ears?

1258
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,762
Oh, God, I hope not.

1259
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,860
I'll snitch a frock out of
National Theater storage for you.

1260
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,771
Something of
Dame Edith Evans. Oh.

1261
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,274
What's the matter?

1262
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:43,937
I'm waiting for you
to tell me she was gay.

1263
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,741
She wasn't, actually.

1264
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,282
One of two British
actresses who isn't.

1265
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,840
I think the other one
is Deborah Kerr.

1266
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:54,685
But all the rest,
galloping lezzies.

1267
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:57,224
Do you have a boyfriend
over there?

1268
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,726
Not anymore.

1269
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,660
What about you?

1270
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,824
Oh, darling,
when the going gets tough,

1271
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,801
weak boyfriends get going,
or something like that.

1272
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,895
I can't say
I'm honestly minding.

1273
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,303
Last acts
are depressing,

1274
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,568
and generally
one long solo.

1275
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,475
Well, they don't have to be.

1276
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,206
How sick are you?

1277
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,043
I think I'm in
pretty good nick,

1278
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,948
but my reports read like
something out of Nostradamus.

1279
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,486
I should have died
six months ago.

1280
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,954
Try 18.

1281
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,285
Do you have any lesions?

1282
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,325
Only one,

1283
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:34,021
and I've had it
for nearly a year.

1284
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:37,031
- Where is it?
- In a very inconvenient spot.

1285
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:40,091
Oh, they are all
inconvenient.

1286
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,104
May I see it?

1287
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,376
It's, uh...

1288
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,642
All right.

1289
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,414
I, um...

1290
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,753
I have a lesbian
friend in London,

1291
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,850
who's the only other person
who's ever asked to see it.

1292
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:08,419
I was quite astonished
when she did.

1293
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:11,193
Touched, actually.

1294
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:12,631
Somebody loves me,

1295
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:15,397
even if it's not the somebody
I've dreamed of.

1296
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,445
Are you through?

1297
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:50,596
Gwenyth didn't go that far.

1298
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,276
It doesn't disgust you?

1299
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,643
It's going to be me.

1300
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,306
You don't know that.

1301
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,111
Yes, I do.

1302
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,592
You're very nice, you know?

1303
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,389
So are you.

1304
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:17,694
No, l-- I mean it.

1305
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,762
So do l.

1306
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,667
# Happy anniversary to you #

1307
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:58,638
# Happy anniversary to you #

1308
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,301
# Happy anniversary #

1309
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:05,437
# Arthur and Perry #

1310
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:09,143
# Happy anniversary #

1311
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:12,277
# To you #

1312
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,515
Bravo.

1313
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,113
Whoo, speech!

1314
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,126
All right, blow out the candles
and make a wish.

1315
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,794
Whoo!

1316
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,561
Whoo!

1317
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,068
All right, now,
speech now.

1318
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,330
Speech, speech, speech.

1319
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,770
Oh, no, no, no.

1320
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,475
I'm married to the best man
in the world,

1321
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,537
even if he does forget
to put the toothpaste cap back on

1322
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,639
and squeezes the tube
in the middle.

1323
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:52,487
I wish him long life...

1324
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,724
much love...

1325
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:58,789
and as much happiness
as he's brought me.

1326
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,337
Ditto.

1327
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,143
Oh, God.

1328
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:18,110
"Ditto"?

1329
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:21,883
That's it, "ditto"?
Oh, God.

1330
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:25,552
# And wouldn't sleep #

1331
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:29,495
# When love came
and told me... #

1332
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,727
Oh, that's nice.

1333
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,793
Don't go and get all
goody twoshoes on us.

1334
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,532
Everybody dance.

1335
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,541
All lovers dance.

1336
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,804
What about us single girls?

1337
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:49,009
You know you're
dying to ask me.

1338
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,929
So what was your wish?

1339
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,000
No fucking way, Jose.

1340
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:13,199
He still thinks you're gonna get me
into one of those fucking tutus.

1341
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,267
Gregory.

1342
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,674
# Each spring to him #

1343
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:26,653
# And long for the day #

1344
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:30,851
# When I'll cling to him #

1345
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:37,161
# Bewitched, bothered
and bewildered #

1346
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:40,292
# Am I #

1347
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,502
# He's a fool,
and don't I know it? #

1348
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:46,007
# But a fool
can have his chance #

1349
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:50,910
# But a fool
can have his chance #

1350
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:54,881
# I'm in love,
and don't I show it? #

1351
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,941
# Like the day before... #

1352
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,883
You're still here.

1353
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:04,455
I would have driven you,
uh, in, uh.

1354
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,859
We've got guests.

1355
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:14,964
We both need time to think.

1356
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:21,142
I don't.

1357
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,157
I'm sorry.

1358
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,060
I love you.

1359
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,947
Hurry back to me.

1360
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,526
Got a few steps.

1361
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,187
Okay.

1362
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:18,955
Here, give me your bag.

1363
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:36,150
# Though he's speaking #

1364
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,811
# He's at his very best... #

1365
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,445
Arthur, look.

1366
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,356
# Vexed again... #

1367
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,964
Answered prayers.

1368
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,398
# Thank God #

1369
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:58,701
# I can be oversexed again #

1370
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:00,764
# Bewitched #

1371
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:01,831
# Bothered #

1372
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,607
# And bewildered #

1373
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:12,950
# Am I #

1374
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,819
# Wise at last #

1375
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,451
# My eyes at last #

1376
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:23,190
# Are cutting you down #

1377
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,064
# To your size at last #

1378
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:29,433
# Bewitched #

1379
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,096
# Bothered #

1380
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:35,632
# And bewildered #

1381
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,014
# No more #

1382
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,311
# No more #

1383
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,009
Labor Day weekend,

1384
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:45,177
but already it feels
like the end of summer.

1385
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,778
Perhaps the autumnal chill
in the air

1386
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,552
is telling us this will be
our last weekend.

1387
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,287
The lawns are brown,

1388
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,556
the gardens wilted.

1389
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,827
Soon it will be
back to school.

1390
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:04,135
James Jeckyll has decided
to stay in the States.

1391
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,641
Buzz says he will get
much better care here.

1392
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,143
He will also get Buzz.

1393
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,975
Who could not love
James?

1394
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,142
We have all taken him
to our hearts.

1395
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:20,415
It will be a sad day
when that light goes out.

1396
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,123
I keep telling everyone

1397
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,660
the new piece
is nearly finished,

1398
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,663
but the truth is
I haven't begun.

1399
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,859
Maybe it isn't meant to be.

1400
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,834
I wish
I could blame Bobby.

1401
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,643
It hasn't been easy

1402
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:47,681
since he got back
from his sister's funeral...

1403
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,979
but we're working on it.

1404
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,143
Bobby.

1405
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,687
I really wish
I could blame Ramon.

1406
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,987
I hadn't counted on him
coming with John this time.

1407
01:24:58,059 --> 01:24:59,686
Bobby.

1408
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,321
I thought they were over.

1409
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,126
Hey, did you hear that?

1410
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,133
- Hmm?
- Did you?

1411
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:08,135
Would you leave them alone?

1412
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:10,137
You're as bad as John.

1413
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,139
I'm not as bad as John.

1414
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:15,267
No one is as bad as John.

1415
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,142
Most of all,

1416
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:23,912
I wish I could
let what happened go.

1417
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:30,791
Ssshit!

1418
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,121
Shit!

1419
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:33,785
Shit!

1420
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,669
How are we feeling?

1421
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,212
Not sexy.

1422
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,578
How are you feeling really?

1423
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:01,086
We defy augury.

1424
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:05,023
Hmmph.
What does that mean?

1425
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:08,585
Shakespeare.
It means don't fuck with me.

1426
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:09,630
Oh.

1427
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:11,130
Shakespeare was gay,
you know?

1428
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,632
You're going too far now.

1429
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,634
Oh, you really think
a straight man

1430
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:17,694
would write a line like
"We defy augury"? James, get real.

1431
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,640
Good morning, Gregory.

1432
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:30,616
Coffee's brewing.

1433
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,778
Welcome to my diva mode.

1434
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,187
How's work going?

1435
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,220
Don't ask, huh?

1436
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,995
I'll get famous like you, Greg.

1437
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,002
A great dancer...

1438
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,560
Iike you were.

1439
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,541
What's the matter?
What are you looking at?

1440
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:06,483
You're making me feel weird.

1441
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:09,284
I'm sorry.
Great dancer you are,

1442
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,291
I didn't mean it, okay?

1443
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,122
Look, I'm sorry your work
isn't going well.

1444
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:17,130
Ow! Ow!
What are you doing?

1445
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,099
Put your, um, hand,
um, down the drain.

1446
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:21,635
Fuck you. No.

1447
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,603
- Do it!
- What for?

1448
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:24,638
I said do it!

1449
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,333
- What for?!
- You know what for!

1450
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,999
- I don't.
- You know!

1451
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,634
- Because of Bobby?
- Because of Bobby?

1452
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,144
Did you say
because of Bobby?

1453
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,941
What because of Bobby?

1454
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:33,981
Nothing, nothing.

1455
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:38,246
- Put your hand down the drain!
- Jesus, Gregory, what are you--

1456
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,344
He wants me to put my fucking hand
down the drain.

1457
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,513
- Tell them why.
- I don't--

1458
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,147
Tell them why!

1459
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,124
- He thinks me and Bobby...
- That's why.

1460
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:46,182
Gregory, let him go.

1461
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,853
I am gonna break it!

1462
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:11,344
Is that coffee, um,
ready yet?

1463
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,252
That was not funny,
Gregory.

1464
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:15,619
Are you all right?

1465
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,521
That wasn't about me
and Bobby.

1466
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,651
That was about me
and you!

1467
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:21,627
Coffee, Perry?

1468
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,687
Thanks.

1469
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,131
You're old
and you're scared,

1470
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,031
and you don't know
what to do about it.

1471
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,592
Buzz?

1472
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:30,729
Yeah, I'll...

1473
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,636
I am young,
I am not scared,

1474
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:34,197
and I am coming
after you.

1475
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:35,503
Ramon?

1476
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,136
That's what
this was about.

1477
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:40,271
Yes, please.
With milk.

1478
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:45,809
One caf con leche,

1479
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,320
For Ramon.

1480
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:48,480
Hmm.

1481
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:49,716
Thank you.

1482
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:54,020
Well, my stomach
is up in my throat.

1483
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,289
I knew he wouldn't do it.

1484
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,660
I knew you
wouldn't do it.

1485
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,323
Oh, yeah.
Macho man herself here.

1486
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,458
Yeah, he's just lucky
I didn't pop him one.

1487
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:04,501
Sorry.

1488
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:06,164
Coffee grounds.

1489
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,970
You're not supposed
to put them down there.

1490
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:13,610
Ramon, would you, um,

1491
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,844
take this up to,
uh, Bobby?

1492
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:24,553
Thank you.

1493
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:29,619
I

1494
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,136
I can't believe
the rain this summer.

1495
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,296
It's simple.

1496
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,102
God doesn't want us
to develop skin cancer

1497
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:42,642
from overzealous
exposure to his sun

1498
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,143
in our overzealous
pursuit

1499
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,113
of looking drop-dead
good to one another.

1500
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:49,149
Look out for that log.

1501
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,152
That's big of him.
I see it.

1502
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,654
After AlDS, he figures
we deserve a break.

1503
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:58,158
That's $5.

1504
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,160
Oh, I think we stopped
playing that game.

1505
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,163
Who won?

1506
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,825
Well, not Buzz and James.

1507
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:11,672
Do you ever feel guilty?

1508
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,001
No.

1509
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,666
Grateful.

1510
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,141
Why?

1511
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,802
Do you?

1512
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:20,313
Every time
I look at Buzz,

1513
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,178
even when
he's driving me crazy,

1514
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,683
or now James,

1515
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,685
I have to think or say
to myself,

1516
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:29,189
"Sooner or later,
that man--

1517
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,690
that human being,

1518
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,692
won't be standing there
washing the dishes

1519
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,193
or tying his shoelace."

1520
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:37,527
None of us is...

1521
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:40,499
are.

1522
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:42,035
Is?

1523
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:45,697
Are?

1524
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:46,831
I don't know.

1525
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:48,637
Are?

1526
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,713
Oh, but you're right.

1527
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,375
It's no comfort,
but you're right.

1528
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,477
Will be.
None of us will be.

1529
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:04,090
Watch your step.

1530
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:05,591
A little more.

1531
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,594
Up.

1532
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,254
Real good.

1533
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:11,790
Watch out there.

1534
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:31,978
Up.

1535
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,020
Okay.

1536
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,520
Move back.

1537
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:37,615
That's it.

1538
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,517
You're dying, aren't you?

1539
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:55,292
There's so many things
I've never said to you,

1540
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:57,837
things we've never
spoken about.

1541
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:01,033
I don't want to wait
until it's too late to say them.

1542
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:08,841
I resent you.

1543
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,652
I resent everything about you.

1544
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:15,655
You had Mom and Dad's
unconditional love.

1545
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,624
Now you have the world's.

1546
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:21,161
How can I not envy that?

1547
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:23,287
I wish I could say
it was because

1548
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:25,594
you're so much
better looking than me.

1549
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:27,600
No.

1550
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:29,295
The real pain

1551
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:33,136
is that it's something
that's so much harder to bear.

1552
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:36,040
You got the good soul.

1553
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:41,045
I got the bad one.

1554
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:43,413
Think about leaving me yours.

1555
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:49,014
So...

1556
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:52,082
what's your secret?

1557
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,093
The secret of unconditional love.

1558
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:57,597
I'm not going to let you die with it.

1559
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:59,792
There's no secret.

1560
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,128
It's all right.

1561
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:07,697
- I understand.
- No.

1562
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:09,242
I hated you.

1563
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,470
John. John...

1564
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:13,138
I wished...

1565
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:14,806
you were dead.

1566
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,008
Stop it!

1567
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,141
Shh.

1568
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,152
You just thought you did.

1569
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,188
There's a difference.

1570
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:39,267
I just wanted to be
the one they loved.

1571
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:43,338
And now...

1572
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,879
you will be.

1573
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:10,761
How is he?

1574
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:13,798
Don't ask.

1575
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,774
Poor guy.

1576
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:17,777
How are you?

1577
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,206
Weary and wonderful.

1578
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:29,989
Anyway, I was just
gonna go take a shower.

1579
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,922
Oh, um...

1580
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:34,187
I think we used up
all the hot water.

1581
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:35,228
Oh.

1582
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:36,957
I could fetch, uh...

1583
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:38,862
No, I'll just do it later.

1584
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:40,457
Really, Buzz.
It's fine.

1585
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:42,365
Ah. If this were a musical,

1586
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,370
that'd be such
a great cue for a song.

1587
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:46,406
Really, Buzz.
It's fine. I got...

1588
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:48,874
# Tok tok, sss,
steam heat. #

1589
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:53,006
Life and Gregory's plumbing
should be more like a musical.

1590
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,945
There is always
a happy ending.

1591
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:57,643
And plenty of hot water.

1592
01:35:57,718 --> 01:36:01,552
Perry, just once I would love to see
a "West Side Story"

1593
01:36:01,622 --> 01:36:03,453
where everyone gets it.

1594
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:05,321
The Jets and the Sharks

1595
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:07,326
and Officer Krupke, too,
while we're at it.

1596
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,328
What's he doing?
Sneaking away from the theater?

1597
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:11,796
Get back here and die
like everyone else, you son of a bitch!

1598
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:14,664
I wanna see a "Sound of Music"

1599
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:16,635
where the entire Von Trapp family

1600
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:19,036
dies in an authentic
alpine avalanche,

1601
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:22,803
or a "Kiss me, Kate" where she's got
a huge cold sore on her mouth.

1602
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:24,174
Oh, God.

1603
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,270
"A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum."

1604
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:28,042
And the only thing
that happens is nothing!

1605
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:30,845
And it's not funny!
And they all go down waiting!

1606
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:32,852
Waiting for what?
Waiting for nothing,

1607
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,356
Iike everyone I know
or care about is--

1608
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:38,414
including myself.

1609
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:40,858
That's the kind of musical
I'd like to see,

1610
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:45,194
but they don't write musicals
like that anymore.

1611
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:49,702
So in the meantime,

1612
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:51,362
gangway, world.

1613
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:54,202
Get off of my runway.

1614
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:59,712
You are my oldest
friend in the world.

1615
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,578
And next to Arthur,
my best.

1616
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:06,279
It's not enough sometimes, Perry.

1617
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:08,753
You're not sick.

1618
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:13,123
You two are gonna wind up on Golden
Pond in matching wicker rockers.

1619
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:15,355
That's not fair!
We can't help that.

1620
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:17,829
I can't afford to be fair.

1621
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:21,129
Fair is a luxury
I can't afford.

1622
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:23,329
Fair is for healthy people
with healthy lovers

1623
01:37:23,404 --> 01:37:26,339
in nice apartments
with lots of health insurance,

1624
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:29,672
which, of course,
they don't need!

1625
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:32,211
Are you through?

1626
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,988
I'm scared that I'm not gonna be there for
James when he needs me.

1627
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,190
And I'm so angry

1628
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:48,592
that he's not gonna be there for me
when I need him.

1629
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,692
I know.

1630
01:37:54,768 --> 01:37:56,235
I know.

1631
01:37:57,438 --> 01:38:00,635
I said I wasn't
gonna do this anymore.

1632
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,303
But it's wonderful what's happened,
you know?

1633
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,312
It's wonderful.

1634
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,940
Who?

1635
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:10,813
Who is gonna be there for me

1636
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,318
when it's my turn?

1637
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:15,014
We all will.
Every one of us.

1638
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:21,384
Can you promise me that?

1639
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:25,457
Can you promise...

1640
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:28,160
that you will be
holding my hand

1641
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:29,998
when I let go?

1642
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:33,472
That the last face I see...

1643
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,906
will be yours?

1644
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,546
Yes.

1645
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:52,790
I believe you.

1646
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,523
Mine and Arthur's.

1647
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:03,267
Arthur's is negotiable.

1648
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,300
I...

1649
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:10,809
can't tell you

1650
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:12,641
how important
this is to me.

1651
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:16,110
I'm a very petty person.

1652
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:17,980
No, you're not.

1653
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,111
Buzz?

1654
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:23,418
Thank you.

1655
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:29,958
I adore him.

1656
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:36,699
What am I gonna do?

1657
01:39:49,383 --> 01:39:49,405
I

1658
01:39:51,418 --> 01:39:53,352
- Hey.
- Hi.

1659
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:55,251
Oh, thanks.

1660
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,351
Tuck it in, Arthur.

1661
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:00,859
I beg your pardon.

1662
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:02,361
See, that's what I keep
telling him.

1663
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:04,863
If your just gonna sit on the sidelines
and be a kibitz...

1664
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:06,365
Kibitz?
What's a kibitz?

1665
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:09,197
A place where very old, gay,
Jewish couples go.

1666
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:11,863
All right, gentlemen,
line up.

1667
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,873
From the top.

1668
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:16,102
Here we go, guys.

1669
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:18,769
John.

1670
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:23,716
Here we go, everyone.

1671
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:25,752
You started without me.

1672
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:29,419
We thought you were resting.

1673
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:33,153
Don't stop.
Just let me in.

1674
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:34,285
It's all right.

1675
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:35,658
It's all right.

1676
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,530
All right, gentlemen,

1677
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:42,262
this is a take.

1678
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,815
5 and 6 and 7 and 8.

1679
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:57,908
And 1 and 2

1680
01:40:57,985 --> 01:40:59,509
and 3 and 4

1681
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:01,178
and 5 and 6

1682
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:02,847
and 7 and 8.

1683
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:04,891
Very good.
Very good.

1684
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:07,256
Ow.
Buzz kicked me.

1685
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,659
Tattletale.
Shut up and dance.

1686
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:11,664
That's from "Gypsy."

1687
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:15,733
That's amazing
for an accountant.

1688
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:17,270
And 2.

1689
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:19,066
How are we looking?

1690
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:22,040
Actually, you look
like you're having fun.

1691
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:34,349
Getting behind
the music, gentlemen, come on.

1692
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:46,060
Whoop.
I always want to go left on that.

1693
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:47,100
Up.

1694
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,964
7 and 8.

1695
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:50,663
And 1 and 2 and--

1696
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:53,740
James!
James!

1697
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:54,796
No, I'm fine.

1698
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:55,864
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1699
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,274
Everybody...

1700
01:41:57,344 --> 01:41:58,311
back off.

1701
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:01,313
- I just want to go lie down a bit.
- Uh, I'll--

1702
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:02,575
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Please.

1703
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,241
Go on, please.

1704
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:07,082
You need all the rehearsal
you can get.

1705
01:42:08,522 --> 01:42:10,490
I've got him.

1706
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:17,257
Buzz, maybe
you should go.

1707
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:18,730
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

1708
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:19,823
Sorry.

1709
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:26,363
Perry, put on the record. That's how we're
gonna perform it anyway.

1710
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,771
The piano is for stop and start,

1711
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:29,274
And we're way beyond
stop and start.

1712
01:42:29,343 --> 01:42:30,605
- We're one short again.
- We'll live.

1713
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:34,408
All right, come on, girls.
Places. Tops.

1714
01:42:57,371 --> 01:42:59,305
I have 27 years,

1715
01:42:59,373 --> 01:43:01,807
8 months, 6 days,
3 hours,

1716
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:04,605
31 minutes,
and 1 1 seconds left.

1717
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:07,203
I will be watching
"Gone With the Wind,"

1718
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,748
of all things,

1719
01:43:08,815 --> 01:43:10,214
again on television.

1720
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:12,218
Arthur will be
in the other room

1721
01:43:12,286 --> 01:43:13,719
fixing me hot cocoa

1722
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:16,722
and arguing with his brother
on the phone.

1723
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:19,486
He won't even hear me go.

1724
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:25,730
He insisted on keeping
the TV on so loud.

1725
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:28,267
Wouldn't buy
a hearing supplement.

1726
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:30,769
Three years later,
it's my turn.

1727
01:43:30,837 --> 01:43:32,771
On the bus.

1728
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:34,272
The M-9.

1729
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:36,241
Quietly.
Very quietly.

1730
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,244
Just like my life.

1731
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:41,748
Without him,
I won't much mind.

1732
01:43:44,818 --> 01:43:47,286
I don't want to think about it.

1733
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:49,754
Soon.

1734
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:53,315
Sooner
than I thought, even.

1735
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:56,226
Let's just say
I died happy.

1736
01:43:56,296 --> 01:44:00,027
They reissued
"Happy Hunting" on CD,

1737
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,864
and I'd met Gwen Verdon
at a benefit.

1738
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:04,699
She was very nice,

1739
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:08,332
and I don't think
it was because she knew I was sick.

1740
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:14,208
I wasn't brave.

1741
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:16,249
I took pills.

1742
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:18,750
I went back home
to Battersea

1743
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:21,720
and took pills.

1744
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:23,949
I'm sorry, Buzz.

1745
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:26,925
I don't die.

1746
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:28,427
I'm fucking immortal.

1747
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:31,259
I live forever...

1748
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:35,267
till I take a small plane
to Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1749
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:37,098
I was late for a concert.

1750
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,229
No one else from my company
was onboard.

1751
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:40,773
Just me

1752
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:43,969
and a pilot I never bothered
to look at twice.

1753
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,779
I don't know.

1754
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:52,785
I don't want to.

1755
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:56,414
I won't be with Gregory.

1756
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:58,822
His name will be Luke.

1757
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:04,222
I'm sorry, Gregory.

1758
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,238
I didn't change,

1759
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:14,206
and I tried.

1760
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:16,834
At least I think I tried.

1761
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,076
I couldn't. I just couldn't.

1762
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,740
No one mourned me.

1763
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:26,013
Not one tear was shed.

1764
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,754
I bury every one of you.

1765
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:35,727
It got awfully lonely out here.

1766
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:37,764
It will seem like...

1767
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:39,856
forever.

1768
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,771
Oh! Whoa.

1769
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,781
How the hell
did that happen?

1770
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:58,249
- What?
- The lights went out.

1771
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:01,981
There will be no performance
of "The Red Shoes" tonight.

1772
01:46:04,925 --> 01:46:07,723
Oh, boy.

1773
01:46:07,794 --> 01:46:09,284
Come on, Bobby.

1774
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,758
When do you expect
the power back on?

1775
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:16,700
Are the lights still out?

1776
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:18,237
Ohh. Could be forever.

1777
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:20,899
All right, you. You don't have to sound
so cheerful about it.

1778
01:46:20,974 --> 01:46:22,839
Who's turn is it
to do the dishes?

1779
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:25,343
- I'll start.
- No, it's Buzz. No.

1780
01:46:25,412 --> 01:46:27,778
It's Buzz, it's Buzz,
it's Buzz.

1781
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:31,750
How is he?

1782
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:34,412
He's sleeping,
but he's better.

1783
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:37,079
He's a little better.

1784
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:41,760
You've all been so...

1785
01:46:47,801 --> 01:46:50,099
I want you to like me.

1786
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:13,718
Oh, look out there.
It's clearing up.

1787
01:47:13,794 --> 01:47:16,729
Ah, there's a full moon.
The lake is incredible.

1788
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:19,732
This is why people
have places in the country.

1789
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,233
Even gay people?

1790
01:47:21,301 --> 01:47:22,734
Drop it, you two.

1791
01:47:22,803 --> 01:47:26,261
You can practically read
by that moonlight.

1792
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:29,241
All right.

1793
01:47:29,309 --> 01:47:30,742
Let's go swimming.

1794
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:33,712
Huh? Come on, Bobby.
Come on, let's go.

1795
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,645
No. Moonlight's
wasted on me.

1796
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:37,239
Go down to the lake,
all of you.

1797
01:47:37,317 --> 01:47:38,716
I'll be down in a bit.

1798
01:47:38,785 --> 01:47:39,752
Ah, he's a saint.

1799
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,185
He's gorgeous,
and he's a saint.

1800
01:47:41,254 --> 01:47:42,414
Let's go.

1801
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:44,218
What's the weather
supposed to be tomorrow?

1802
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,283
- More rain.
- Ah, no.

1803
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:51,922
John...

1804
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:54,489
we're all going
down to the lake!

1805
01:47:56,336 --> 01:47:58,270
No, and I have
never had the guts.

1806
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:00,272
Watch out
for the alligators.

1807
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:01,773
Oh, no.
Don't even joke.

1808
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,332
And stay clear
of the water moccasins.

1809
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:04,707
If I see one snake...

1810
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:06,712
that isn't in a trouser...

1811
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,714
That a girl. Come on.

1812
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:11,546
If we had enough guts
to put on those tutus,

1813
01:48:11,618 --> 01:48:13,711
we'll have enough guts
to go in this pond.

1814
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:18,387
- I am insane.
- Okay, I'm going.

1815
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:20,483
- Whoo!
- Come on, baby!

1816
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,549
Whoo-hoo!

1817
01:48:21,628 --> 01:48:24,392
- Whoo hoo hoo! Go, girl!
- Whoo!

1818
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:45,216
Who's there?
Somebody's there.

1819
01:48:45,285 --> 01:48:46,718
It's me.

1820
01:48:46,786 --> 01:48:49,755
You look very handsome
in the moonlight.

1821
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:51,757
You took my breath away.

1822
01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:54,225
I'm going
to remember you like that.

1823
01:48:54,294 --> 01:48:55,420
It's James.

1824
01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:56,723
I know.

1825
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,764
Are you supposed
to be down here?

1826
01:48:58,832 --> 01:49:00,766
No, and neither are you.

1827
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:02,199
There's a full moon.

1828
01:49:02,269 --> 01:49:03,668
Everyone's down by the lake.

1829
01:49:03,737 --> 01:49:06,205
I could see them
from my window.

1830
01:49:06,273 --> 01:49:09,037
Come on.
I'll go with you.

1831
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:11,634
Come on. Come on.

1832
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:17,172
Oh.

1833
01:49:19,286 --> 01:49:21,311
Look at Arthur.

1834
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,720
I have a confession
to make.

1835
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:26,691
I've never been
skinny-dipping in the moonlight

1836
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,728
with a blind American.

1837
01:49:28,795 --> 01:49:30,228
But you only live once.

1838
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:31,559
If you're lucky.

1839
01:49:31,631 --> 01:49:33,565
Some people don't live at all.

1840
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:34,725
Yes.

1841
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:36,735
I thought you were scared
of that snapping turtle.

1842
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:38,236
I'm terrified of it.

1843
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:41,206
I'm counting on you.

1844
01:49:41,274 --> 01:49:43,242
Well, let's go.

1845
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:46,245
I have another
confession to make.

1846
01:49:46,313 --> 01:49:47,541
I'm English.

1847
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:50,276
I've never been skinny-dipping
in the moonlight with anyone.

1848
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,716
I knew that.

1849
01:49:55,822 --> 01:49:56,914
James!

1850
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:59,515
Hey! Yeah.

1851
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:03,262
- Look.
- Honey.

1852
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:05,730
Wait a minute,
sweetheart--

1853
01:50:05,799 --> 01:50:07,767
- Whoo!
- Wait a minute.

1854
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:11,270
Come on, Bobby!

1855
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:13,272
Honey, I thought
you were sleeping.

1856
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,035
Honey,
are you getting in?

1857
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:35,988
Everybody in!

1858
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:37,290
Come on!

1859
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:39,161
Whoa!

1860
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,116
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

1861
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:37,281
I saw a shooting star!

1862
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,484
Wait, wait,
I have to make a wish.

1863
01:51:43,296 --> 01:51:43,318
I
