00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,520
CALVIN: Gus Delario--
the invisible man is Gus.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,880
He's one of those guys...

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,560
who you feel like
you know them really well...

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,560
but when
you think about it...

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,720
you don't really know them
at all. you know what I mean?

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,560
And. you know. obviously...

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,560
you look at his track record
of all the movies he's done--

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,880
He's been very successful.
Almost every actor in town...

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,840
wants to work in. you know.
one of Gus's movies.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,560
FRANCESCA: I've done
some mean things in my life.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,520
Yeah. And sometimes.
the--ahem. ahem--

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,720
the worst part is
is that sometimes...

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,520
it doesn't bother me.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
I just say. well.
yeah. this is mean.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
I wanted to be mean.
and I was mean.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,880
Period.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,920
LEE: Well. I have to be
somewhat judgmental...

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,280
because of what I do.
you know...

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,160
so I don't think
that it's such a bad thing...

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,080
to be judgmental.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,000
I think that's
how you get through life.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,840
You have to assess things...

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,520
and people do it
about you all the time...

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,480
and that's life.
and it's too bad.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,200
CARL: I think there is
no amount of money...

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,040
I could have been paid--

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,080
there is no deal
that I could have made...

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,160
that she would not have felt
that I had been too passive...

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,920
and that--I think that...

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,600
her opinion of me
on that level...

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
was formed before
the movie was ever sold.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I think it has nothing to do
with the movie. frankly.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,680
ARTHUR: It's frightening.
It's monstrous.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,080
It's evil
to not have feelings.

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,720
So I spoke to Carl about it.
and we discussed it...

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,840
and we went immediately...

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
to the most monstrous
character...

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
we could think of in history--

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
you know. Hitler himself.

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
LINDA: Yeah. they're always
trying to set me up...

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,720
Lee and Carl. They--

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,840
Well. they never have
introduced me to anyone...

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,520
but they always talk about
how I should be dating.

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
But they're
trying to set me up now...

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,040
with this producer friend
of theirs--a guy named Gus.

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,000
Uh... we'll see.
I don 't think...

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,280
a film producer's going to go
for me. but I don 't know.

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,280
(Piano music playing)

51
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,480
-Catherine?
-Nicholas.

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Yes.

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,880
-How are you?
-l'm good. How are you?

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Excellent. Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

55
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,760
-Sure.
-Mind if we get started?

56
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,480
So, I play his partner.

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,840
An equal partner?

58
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,000
No, l'm his flunky...

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,760
if that's what you want to hear.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,200
Is that what you want to write?

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
Is that what
you want me to write?

62
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,960
No.
No, you can write sidekick.

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
That's fine.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,760
See, the thing is,
l've done a lot of TV.

65
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,360
He's an established star,

a big star.

66
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,960
I figure it doesn't make me
any less talented.

67
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
So, no,

I don't have a problem with it.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,240
Look, if l'm going to make
the leap to the big screen...

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
I expect to work for it.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't that make sense?

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
Don't you think
most black actors...

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,960
expect to have to work
to make that leap?

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,640
It doesn't seem to happen
as often with white actors.

74
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,760
-Jesus.
-Don't you find that the case?

75
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
A couple of movies...

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,400
1 5, 20 million dollar paychecks,
magazine covers.

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
OK, is this the kind of story
you want to write?

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,400
We can go there.

79
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,480
Trust me, l've got plenty
of opinions on the subject.

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,280
(Heavy breathing)

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,720
Jesus.

82
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,360
(Shower running)

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,480
LEE: Carl.
I've reached the point...

84
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,920
where I can't continue
in this marriage.

85
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm writing because
I can't take any more...

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,680
emotional confrontations
about it.

87
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm out of ideas.
and I want to make a change.

88
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,080
When I get home tonight.
we can discuss...

89
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
the practical issues
of how to separate.

90
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,040
Please don 't call me.
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Fifth robbery in two weeks
at a pornographic bookstore.

92
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
CARL: Oh.

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,440
LEE:
They say it's a woman.

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Jesus.

95
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,800
Did you have
bad dreams last night?

96
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
LEE: No.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Well, I did.

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, I had a weird dream.

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
I dreamt that my job...

100
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,320
was that every day
I would go into work...

101
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,360
and narrate a documentary
about some guy's life...

102
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,120
and go home from work
and have dinner...

103
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,720
and go to bed and go back
to work in the morning.

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,160
It's like
I have no effect on anyone.

105
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,520
So. what's on for today?

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,600
More bloodshed.

107
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,080
God.
How do you stand it?

108
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,480
(Sighs) Hey, listen, don't
forget to make the brownies...

109
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,080
for Gus tonight, OK?

110
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,280
Right.

111
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,480
Bye.

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,160
ARTHUR: Nobody I know...

113
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,520
is in any kind
of long-term relationship...

114
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,039
with anybody they've met
on the internet...

115
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,560
but the short-term stuff
have been pretty exciting.

116
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,479
I don't know what
I'm gonna do when I meet her.

117
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,520
She thinks I'm twenty-two
years old. and I'm not.

118
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not a painter.
although I'd like to paint.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,400
So. it could be anything.

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,240
I mean. the imagination
could take you anywhere.

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,200
I find that
really. really exciting.

122
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,840
And it's one of those places
where I can lie.

123
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,880
LINDA: I'm happy with
meeting men on the computer...

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
on the internet.
in the chat rooms.

125
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,800
And. you know.
people disappoint...

126
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,480
and these people
don 't so much. so...

127
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,760
I really connected
with somebody.

128
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,960
So--and he's a painter...

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
and. you know. gosh...

130
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,200
five years from now. I'd like
to be living there with him.

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,000
I've told him
I'm a massage therapist...

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,080
and I didn't lie.

133
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,240
Um...

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,240
I lied a little about my age--

135
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
just a little--
because he's so young.

136
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,920
(Laughs) So. I just knocked
a few years off of that.

137
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,440
CAL VIN: She said.
No. baby. you're bored...

138
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,600
but why are you
taking that out on us?

139
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
(Chuckles)
It was that kind of thing.

140
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,040
It just--you know,
everything clicked...

141
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
for me.

142
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,800
(Click)
Oh. Sorry.

143
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,600
You transcribe those yourself?

144
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Someone at work.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,680
-Like an intern?
-Mm-hmm.

146
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,840
Male or female?

147
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
What do you think?

148
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Male.

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,080
(Laughs)
Yeah. So, which is it?

150
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,880
And don't tell me
you're not gonna say.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,120
Male.

152
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
-Ah.
-Mm-hmm.

153
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Do you want to know
if he's straight?

154
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, no, I know he's straight.

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,560
(Cell phone ringing)

156
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,520
Oh, shit.

157
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Yeah, l'm coming, l'm coming.

158
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,240
(Ring ring)
Wait. Wait. I--

159
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
(Ring ring)

160
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,840
Django, go, go, go, go, go.

161
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,040
(Ring ring)

162
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,160
(Ring ring)

163
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,040
(Beep beep)

164
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Hey, Frank!

165
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,520
CARL: I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what it's like.

166
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,040
OK. you know.
I work at this magazine.

167
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,800
This magazine is great.
It's very good.

168
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,760
It has very high standards.
I think.

169
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
I think they can do
really good work.

170
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,800
But I think the guy
who runs the thing...

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
is just not very smart.

172
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I mean. you know.
this is between us...

173
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
but I just don 't think
he's very smart.

174
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I think his instincts
are all wrong...

175
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,960
and I think
he's. you know. the big butt.

176
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,600
LEE: Yeah. you know.
I've lost my temper in traffic.

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,880
I have. I've lost my temper.

178
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I wouldn't call it road rage...

179
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,920
but I have gotten pissed
driving...

180
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,240
because people. you know...

181
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,560
they drive cars
that are ridiculous--

182
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,120
you know. wrong for them.

183
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,040
(Car door opens)

184
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,000
(Car beeping)

185
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,280
I don 't really like my job.

186
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,640
I've thought about
doing something else.

187
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,400
I like the money.

188
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,520
I don't even
like that that much.

189
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,720
I could get a betterjob.

190
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,720
LINDA: Lee is ambitious
and smart and beautiful...

191
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,600
and she always has been
all of those things...

192
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,560
and she's always done
really well. you know?

193
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,120
So. maybe she is
completely in control.

194
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
(Razor buzzing)

195
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,800
-Hey.
-Hey.

196
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,280
-Coffee.
-Herr director.

197
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,360
-How are you?
-What's up, man?

198
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Rehearsing something
for ten days sucks.

199
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
And I know how tough it's been.

200
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,560
Oh. no. no. no.
Listen. Iisten...

201
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,240
I think I know
where you're going. man.

202
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,760
First of all,

I got to apologize.

203
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,520
I know l've been
all over the map...

204
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,160
and that's my process,
and l've kind of been crazy.

205
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,000
Listen, I really feel bad
about what I said...

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to your friend.
I know he's Jewish...

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,200
and I went way too far
with that whole oven thing.

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
But believe me,

I was going over...

209
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,640
some of my anger management
stuff last night...

210
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
and I really feel like
I had another breakthrough.

211
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,920
That's great. That's great.

212
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
But I just--oh, I felt so bad.

213
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
You know what,

Carl and I wrote this for you.

214
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
You are our Hitler.
Don't you ever forget that, OK?

215
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
That means a lot,

but I know this is...

216
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,200
your and Carl's vision--
I mean, you wrote this.

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,560
But, yeah, it's funny,
I was talking to Tom Sizemore...

218
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,080
and he was saying the only way
to learn how to act is to act.

219
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,680
-Right. Yes.
-And I know you're concerned...

220
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,080
because I haven't really
memorized anything...

221
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,240
and l've been
all over the place...

222
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,720
but believe me, on the day--
well, you know, tonight--

223
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,360
yeah, I really think
it's gonna be salty.

224
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,520
You're gonna be OK.

225
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,160
I just want to make sure
you're all right.

226
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,440
-l'm good.
-OK. All right.

227
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
-See you later.
-Oh, hey. Um...

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,680
I don't take cream,

could you--just, black?

229
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,000
-Sure.
-Thanks, pal.

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,160
All right.

231
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,840
* Bad boys. bad boys.
what you gonna do? *

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,720
* What you gonna do
when they come for you? *

233
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,160
LINDA:
Well. no. not married.

234
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
This guy that I was seeing...

235
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,400
This guy Tom that I was seeing
last year at this time...

236
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,720
said when he broke up with me.
he said he was...

237
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
getting back together
with an ex-girlfriend...

238
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,680
but I don 't know
if that's true or not.

239
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,640
I heard he's--
I heard it's not true.

240
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,680
But that's what he said
at the time.

241
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,040
-Hey!
-Hey, how are you?

242
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,920
-l'm OK, how are you?
-Good, good.

243
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,520
It's funny.

244
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,600
Yeah, what are the odds, right?

245
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,840
Well, uh, have a good day.
See you.

246
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,200
LINDA: I like Carl.

247
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,480
Uh, have you ever been
in therapy?

248
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,000
(Chuckles) Who?

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
No. I don't even get that.

250
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,320
I don't even get that.
It's like...

251
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,000
they're just selling you
back to yourself.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,080
What is that?

253
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Hmm.
I never thought of it that way.

254
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
-Mm-hmm.
-Um...

255
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,280
your appetite
is certainly worth noting.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,360
-l'm hungry.
-Mm-hmm.

257
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,160
Oh, don't tell me

you're one of those--

258
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,560
-You don't eat?
-Oh, no, I eat.

259
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,800
I just don't eat airplane food.

260
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Why not? It's first class.

261
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
They cook the shit
on the premises.

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
What's the problem?

263
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,520
I'll wait for the cookies.

264
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,040
Man, how corrupt
was your father?

265
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
And milk.

266
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
Did he kill people?

267
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,920
He killed their spirits.

268
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,000
Did he threaten
their identities?

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,480
Something like that.

270
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
So, what about you?

271
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,920
He, um...

272
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,320
No, no, that's all right.
Sorry.

273
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,720
-No.
-OK.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,480
No, he didn't.

He--he adored me, actually.

275
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,160
-Adored?
-Mm-hmm.

276
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,800
Wow.

277
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,400
I don't think
l've ever been adored.

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,480
CARL: You can get paid
to have sex by a company--

279
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,040
CARL: You can get paid
to have sex by a company--

280
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,520
I mean.
acting in an adult film--

281
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,720
but if some guy pays you
five hundred bucks...

282
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,560
to have sex with him.
that's illegal.

283
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,560
So. you're in porn.

284
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,040
Why are you in porn?
Two reasons.

285
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Either you need the money.
or you're an exhibitionist.

286
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,280
WOMAN: What do you think
is exhibitionism?

287
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,800
CARL: Porn.

288
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,280
What--well. no. OK.
That's a good question.

289
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,080
I think it goes way beyond
just wanting to perform.

290
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,080
You can't pretend that you're
having sex with someone...

291
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,120
when you are actually
having sex with them.

292
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,760
Well, I think

it's easier to think...

293
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,520
that they're
enjoying themselves.

294
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,959
Or maybe they want you
to enjoy yourselves.

295
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,760
Why would you want
to think about it so much?

296
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,400
It's been made to turn you on.
It's nothing deeper than that.

297
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,560
Yes, I do.

298
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,720
Sorry. I thought you said
this didn't bother you.

299
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,400
Carl, I can't have

conversations like this anymore.

300
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
(Chuckles) You can't?

301
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,000
I've met someone.

302
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,040
-Oh.
-lt's not appropriate anymore.

303
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,840
-Oh, I understand.

-Sorry.

304
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,600
Don't be--sorry? Hey, you are
showing absolute respect...

305
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,800
by being honest with me and not
being weird or, you know...

306
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,000
protracted about it.
Thank you.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,880
I just--hey, I like to know
where I stand.

308
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,400
Otherwise,

I feel like an asshole.

309
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,040
(Laughs)

310
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,720
Are you all right?

311
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,040
Yep.

312
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah, I was just thinking
of the rest of my day.

313
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
Jerry wants to meet with me.

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,080
-Really?
-Yes.

315
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,680
He's never liked me,

you know, from day one.

316
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,000
Just--nothing I can do
about that. I just, uh--

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm sure you'll do just fine.

318
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,800
LEE: You are aware
of the recent layoffs. correct?

319
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,040
MAN: Well. yes.

320
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,600
LEE: We're making some changes.
rearranging our priorities...

321
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
getting things straight.
that sort of thing.

322
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,360
(T akes polaroid)

323
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,000
Mmm. Are you a smoker, Brian?

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
I participate
when it's available.

325
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,040
-Are you a smoker?
-No, but I smoke.

326
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,760
Have you ever been caught
driving under the influence?

327
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,720
Under the influence of what?

328
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,560
DUl--
you're familiar with the term.

329
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,640
Yeah.

330
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
-Correct?
-Yeah.

331
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,080
No. I mean,

what does this have to do with--

332
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,040
Do you vote
democrat or republican?

333
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Neither. Either.
I--I vote for the best person.

334
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,000
-And how do you judge that?
-Uh...

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,680
-Do you know in an instant?
-Yes.

336
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,000
Right.

337
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
Hmm.

338
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,760
(Laughs)

339
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
(Woman crying)

340
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,680
(Man taps table)

341
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
(Sniffles)

342
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,840
Oh, come on, kitten--

the water works?

343
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
You know,

we've talked about this.

344
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,360
Nothing's changed...

345
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,640
since the last time
we had this discussion.

346
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,960
(Sniffles)

347
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,680
No, l'm just--
l'm too committed to my work...

348
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,520
to sustain a serious
relationship right now.

349
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,280
You know, I bring work
home with me. I'm distracted.

350
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
I'm taking a swim in Lake Me,
you know?

351
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,920
And, you--hey, you deserve
better, believe you me.

352
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,280
I would only cause you pain.

353
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,040
Remember how I let you
twirl my key chain?

354
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,400
Nice, right?
Hugging, kissing, all nice.

355
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
Now, go on, sweetie.
Go on, split. Come on, come on.

356
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,320
I'll call you.

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,080
If the phone doesn't ring,
it's probably me.

358
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,840
(Sighing) Oh, man.

359
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
(Pager beeping)

360
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,840
Fucking Goebbels--
he thinks it's a toy.

361
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,560
(Chuckling)
Gone to get haircut.

362
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
What an asshole.

363
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
LINDA: I don't know why.
I just started that.

364
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,080
I don't--I just don't want
them knowing me. you know?

365
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,720
I don't want them knowing me.

366
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,400
I give--I give the name Ann
all the time...

367
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
because it seems like Ann is--

368
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,520
One.

369
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,160
And it's less invasive.

370
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,680
It's less--
or more anonymous. you know?

371
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
More invisible.
If they know me as Ann...

372
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,000
they don't know who really
is in the room with them.

373
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,680
And for some reason.
that feels good to me.

374
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,760
CAL VIN: Nicholas.
I will begin simply.

375
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
l love you.

376
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,160
Have always loved you...

377
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,040
and will always love you.

378
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,800
Ever since the moment
I met you...

379
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,880
the love I feel for you
is overwhelming.

380
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,680
When we are apart,
you are all I think about...

381
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,040
and can't wait until...

382
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,880
we are just even
in the same room again.

383
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,320
Until then.

384
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,360
I've been away a lot.

385
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
(Placing note in envelope)

386
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,000
Ahem.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,480
-Hi.
-Hi.

388
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,760
-Hey, Mike?
-Yes?

389
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,600
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yes.

390
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,720
-lt's kind of personal.
-Shoot.

391
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
Is that your real hair?

392
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Absolutely.

393
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,520
Hmm. I'm thinking of
getting some more.

394
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,640
Don't do that.

395
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,560
-Why not?
-You'll have doll head.

396
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,400
I don't care. I want more hair.

397
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,040
Low-level, free-floating
anxiety about it, you know?

398
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,520
I have anxiety about it.

399
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,680
I see homeless guys
with a full head of hair...

400
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,280
and I think, What the fuck?

401
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,800
You know, Kirk Douglas,
what the fuck--

402
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
Does Lee mind?

403
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,280
Uh, she says no.

404
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,120
Well, that's a lie.

405
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,560
She doesn't say anything,
and I assume that's a no.

406
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,360
We sit in the same room,

we live in the same house...

407
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,000
but, uh...

408
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,240
-And.
-What?

409
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,880
Try changing your buts
to ands. See what happens.

410
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,240
We live in the same house,

and--

411
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
Now you got it.

412
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,760
Yes, I would say that.

413
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,320
-How often?
-Um...

414
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,920
Once a week, once a month,

once a year, once--

415
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,280
-This is kind of--
-l'll come back to that.

416
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,520
(Laughs) God.

417
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,800
Do you believe in him?

418
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,520
Well, you know,
not like a bearded guy--

419
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
It's a yes or no question,
David.

420
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,960
Yes, then.

421
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,200
Listen, l'm sorry,
I just thought--

422
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,040
I'm going to be straight
with you, David, OK?

423
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,440
OK.

424
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
In three years,
you haven't impressed...

425
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,720
a single person at this agency.

426
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,760
You'll be notified officially
through the mail.

427
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,120
-l'll watch for it.
-OK.

428
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,440
Do you have a girlfriend?

429
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,320
-What?
-Are you involved?

430
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,600
Are you--are you--
What--what are you doing?

431
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Put that chair
against the door.

432
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,000
-Ms. Bright?
-Yeah.

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,800
Is this a joke?
'Cause I'm a good sport.

434
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,000
This is a test of skill
of sorts.

435
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,400
I like you, David.
I'll tell you that right now.

436
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,480
-OK.
-OK?

437
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

438
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,440
On one leg--balanced.

439
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,800
(Laughs)

440
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,280
You--you are a piece of work,
do you know that?

441
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,440
-OK.
-Good!

442
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,520
-All righty.
-OK.

443
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,240
Now. name all the countries
in Africa.

444
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,960
-Oh!
-One minute.

445
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,000
LINDA: There's this guy I met
on the internet.

446
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,720
LINDA: There's this guy I met
on the internet.

447
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,840
WOMAN:
Ooh. are we doing this now?

448
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,680
LINDA: Mm-hmm. He wants me
to meet him in Tucson...

449
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
for the weekend. He's a kid.

450
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,640
-In Tucson?
-Mmm.

451
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,880
-You have to try these.
-Do they have sugar?

452
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,840
-No. sugar free. Why Tucson?
-Mmm. He lives near there.

453
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,680
WOMAN:
Does he live in the desert?

454
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,400
LINDA: But we're staying
at a Holiday Inn.

455
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,480
-Uhh.
-I'm intrigued.

456
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,200
-ln Tucson?
-These are good.

457
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,040
I know. They're sweetened
with fruit juice.

458
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,000
I could eat
this whole damn tray.

459
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,680
I bought new underwear.

460
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,720
-Have you seen a photo?
-No.

461
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,680
That Holiday lnn part--
that's kind of a little sad.

462
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,120
-Why is that sad?
-Because, Tucson?

463
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,000
-So what? He knows a good one.
-All right.

464
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,040
Seems like you put
a lot of thought into this.

465
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,720
-Planned--we both have.
-Mm-hmm.

466
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,880
-Kind of like a wedding?
-Sort of.

467
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,600
OK, I think that was good,
but I really, really think...

468
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,800
you guys shouldn't make
eye contact.

469
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,320
Hold on, hold on.

470
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,960
That whole thing of you guys
being an extension of me--

471
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,560
Hold on.
Stop giving them directions.

472
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,480
One second.
Just let me work this out, OK?

473
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,360
One second.
You know when we do...

474
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,160
that first scene
where l'm exercising...

475
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
you guys gotta have
athletic supporters.

476
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,040
You know what. stop. Stop.

477
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,480
Hey. guess who the world
doesn't revolve around?

478
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,120
You. OK? I'm trying--

479
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,040
Maybe you want to come out here
and look at it.

480
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,520
Give me the jacket--

481
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,560
Can I talk to you for a second?

482
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm fucking giving my all here.

483
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,160
I know, I know.

484
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm giving my all, and
l'm really fucking worried, OK?

485
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,480
Because last week you tell me...

486
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,400
you want me to play it
like Danny Kaye, right?

487
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,080
This morning,
you come in, and you say...

488
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,880
Hey, why don't you play it
like Alan Alda.

489
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,400
What am l, fucking Danny Alda?

490
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,000
OK, I think

you're really distracted.

491
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,480
You've been
on the fucking laptop...

492
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Iike a little crack monkey,
logging onto Expedia...

493
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,000
for this fucking chick
in Tucson?

494
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
Let me tell you something, man.
This is art.

495
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,960
I dumped my girlfriend
the day we started rehearsals.

496
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
You're not here, man.

You're not present.

497
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
I am here. I am here.

498
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,280
You're not, OK?

And l'm starting to question...

499
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,640
whether you and Carl know what
the fuck you're talking about.

500
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,800
Because let me tell you
something...

501
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,360
Peter Ustinov said,

To act is difficult...

502
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,920
but it's more difficult
to write a bad play...

503
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,680
than to give
a bad performance.

504
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,520
You know what? You know what?

505
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,040
What a great fucking idea,
watching me squirm.

506
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,120
What are you talking about?

507
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,240
-Catherine.
-What are you talking about?

508
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,320
-The letter.
-What letter?

509
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,400
Uh, the letter.

510
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,920
-May l?
-Oh, yeah.

511
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
You're acting crazy.

512
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,320
Hmm.

513
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,440
Wow. Well.

514
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,920
Pretty extraordinary.

515
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,880
Really?

516
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,520
This is a prank, right?

517
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,040
I mean, that's cool.

You can tell me.

518
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I don't think it's a prank, no.

519
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,840
You didn't write this?

520
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,360
Is it your fantasy
that I wrote it?

521
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,040
Oh, don't. Don't do that.

522
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,720
I don't know what to tell you.

523
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,200
OK, here's the deal.

524
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,480
This right here,
you can't write about.

525
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,920
-I can't?
-No, you cannot. It's not fair.

526
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,200
You know, they really do
have ovens back there.

527
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
I am onto you, girl.

528
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
Well, I think l'm onto you,
all right?

529
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,360
Look at me.

530
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,880
-Look at me.
-Oh, my.

531
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Come on,

did you write the letter?

532
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,000
It's OK.

533
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
See?

534
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,880
Ahem. I'm just not gonna play
this game with you anymore.

535
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,440
I ain't even thinking about you.
Look.

536
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,680
You missed a piece.

537
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,760
(Sighs)

538
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,640
CARL: So. Tracy--
is that your given name?

539
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,400
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

540
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,480
And what's your porn name?

541
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,680
I'm--

542
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,480
Do you know about porn names?

543
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,720
-No.
-OK.

544
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,680
Your porn name
is your middle name...

545
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,360
and the name of the first
street you grew up on.

546
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,520
OK.

547
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,160
So. Iike. my porn name
is Andrew Highland.

548
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,440
(Laughs) It's terrible.
It's not very sexy.

549
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,160
So. you're Tracy...

550
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,440
I don't have a middle name.

551
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
Oh. well. you can--

552
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah. well. you can also use
the name of your first pet.

553
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,240
We weren't allowed to have pets.

554
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,840
Ivory Coast, Senegal,
Sierra Leone...

555
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,160
LEE: Mm-hmm. Good.

556
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,960
Ghana, Mali.

557
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,640
Have you ever--been tested
lately for the H.I.V. virus?

558
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,000
No. Yes.
Morocco, Mozambique, Angola...

559
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,640
Good. My goodness.

560
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,280
-Cameroon...
-Stay there.

561
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,640
-Congo...
-God, you are good.

562
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,360
Gabon, Angola.

563
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,480
-Go east.
-Kenya, Somalia Republic...

564
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,160
-Jesus.
-Ethiopia.

565
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,480
Time.
You are very impressive.

566
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,080
I don't think
you're allowed to do this.

567
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,160
(Takes polaroid)

568
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,760
Of course I am.

569
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,000
Get down from there.

570
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,160
LEE: Just meet me
in the lobby. please.

571
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,080
You'll have a great time.
I know you'll love Gus.

572
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,280
I can't go to a party like that.
I have nothing to wear.

573
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,880
LEE: Wear the green dress.
You look great in it.

574
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,840
It's too tight.
It doesn't fit me anymore...

575
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,040
and it has a stain that's--

576
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
LEE:
You always have an excuse.

577
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,880
It's not an excuse.
Lee, that's a reason.

578
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,240
There's a difference.

579
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,640
Look, are we still

having lunch today?

580
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,480
Because I have
a birthday present for you.

581
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,520
LEE: It's tomorrow.

582
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,080
You know what? I know
when your birthday is, OK?

583
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm not here tomorrow.

584
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,720
LEE: Hey. Linda...

585
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,520
Hello?

586
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,200
LEE: You're breaking up.
Call me back.

587
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,560
Hello? Listen, if you can
hear me, call me back.

588
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
LEE: Call me back.

589
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,880
(Hangs up)
Fuck.

590
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,720
LINDA:
Yeah. I think about him a lot.

591
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,640
You know? It's hard.
I found him in the basement.

592
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,040
And then I found Lee...

593
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,280
who was outside. I think.
or somewhere else in the house.

594
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
I mean. I remember screaming...

595
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,000
and then I remember her
appearing.

596
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,120
Uh. and then. you know.
no one else was home...

597
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,920
so she ran to a neighbor's...

598
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,200
and. uh. I stayed with him.

599
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,160
And then neighbors came. and...

600
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,600
and then my mom was home.

601
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,000
They found my mom. and so...

602
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,640
LEE:
It's pretty surprising...

603
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,000
when you see
somebody you know...

604
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,280
Iike your dad. you know.
in that state. you know?

605
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,800
So. it was surprising...

606
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,040
but I think that. you know.
in retrospect. he...

607
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,520
(Groaning)

608
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,680
He was pretty unhappy...

609
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,040
most of the time.

610
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,400
My friend Gus says that people--
the straight world--

611
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,320
will always be fascinated
by gangster sagas...

612
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,560
because, here are these guys...

613
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,640
they say,
We're not going to live...

614
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
by some unspoken rule...

615
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,480
that we don't take you
to the cleaners...

616
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,680
when you're not looking.

617
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,400
We don't have any agreement
not to take advantage of you.

618
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,720
And these people, they're
in the minority, fortunately...

619
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,480
otherwise, there would be chaos.

620
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,560
But we love watching them,
because--because...

621
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,840
it's a walk on the wild side...

622
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,200
without any real risk
of corruption.

623
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
It's two-dimensional, you know?

624
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,440
And it's always
going to be compelling.

625
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,920
Uh, you know, sometimes,
we can't look away.

626
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
But--and we should.

627
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,120
(Door opens)

628
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,120
-Hey, Carl, how you doing, pal?
-Good to see you.

629
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,040
-You look great.
-Thanks. Uh...

630
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,320
you know, that's amazing
that you called today...

631
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,920
because l--ahem--
I needed to see you.

632
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,400
I have an idea. I have an idea.
I think it's a cover.

633
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
You got slobber
all up on your...

634
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,960
Mmm.

635
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,879
What time is it?

636
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,280
Oh, I feel--I feel nauseous.

637
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,800
Are you ready to talk
about this?

638
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,440
Ohh. Nicholas...

639
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,000
Iook, I think

that you're very talented...

640
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,679
and l'll probably write
a very nice piece about you...

641
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,879
but you're really annoying
about this whole letter thing.

642
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,440
No. You're annoying.

643
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,560
Mm-hmm. OK.

644
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,320
CARL: You see. I think that is
worth discussing. I really do.

645
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,600
Well, Carl, l'll discuss

anything with you anytime...

646
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,120
because every time
you've come into my office...

647
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,480
every time
l've asked to see you...

648
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,879
or you've come to see me
with an idea...

649
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,639
about a cover
or a feature story...

650
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,200
or anything you want to do...

651
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,280
it always has validity.
It always has...

652
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,920
it's important to me
to hear your ideas, you know?

653
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,120
Thank you. thank you.

654
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,600
Let me ask you a question.

655
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,360
The reason I called you in
today. actually...

656
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Yeah. Sorry. Ahem.

657
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,720
I have a question for you...

658
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,960
and it's kind of important
to me to hear the answer.

659
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,480
And the question is...

660
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,200
when you go to your
refrigerator in your home...

661
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,080
and you open the door,
and you see a bottle of beer...

662
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,920
do you take
that bottle of beer...

663
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,120
and pour it into a glass
and drink it...

664
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,480
or do you drink it
from the bottle?

665
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,360
Um. I--I--
well. I drink it from a glass.

666
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,320
Ah, you see?

667
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,560
Ohh. That's the problem.

668
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,520
You see, I want this magazine
to drink from the bottle.

669
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,080
In talks? What the fuck, Alex?

670
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,880
Tch. All right, in talks.

671
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,520
I need this.

672
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,600
All right, all right.

673
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,160
NICHOLAS:
I suppose we've come a ways...

674
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,760
since Sambo. Mr. Bojangles.

675
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,560
Step and fetch it. boy. 

676
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,240
What?
Man. call me Mr. Tibbs... 

677
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,880
we've heard Poitier say.

678
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,760
It's a new day. some say.

679
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,920
Because every now and then.
black men are even in.

680
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,080
Motion picture heroes.
It's the American way. Wesley.

681
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,280
Be cute
and still save the world.

682
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
Yes. we will. Will.

683
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,800
Go from Boy in the Hood
to Man of Honor.

684
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,480
Show 'em the money now. Cuba.

685
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,440
Give 'em funnies
like Chris Rock or Tucker.

686
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,840
Or just cool it,
be anybody, like Denzel.

687
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,120
But wait. He ain't even really
getting no loving...

688
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,600
Iike Sidney before him
and whoever after him.

689
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,080
Romancin' and dancin'
with amore's passion...

690
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,400
ain't in the script's equation.

691
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,200
But can even Mr. Washington...

692
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,080
briefly be seen kissing
a Pretty Woman...

693
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,160
underneath a Pelican Moon?

694
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,880
Can even he be a romantic lead?

695
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,000
Check it. From Sambo to Sidney
to Denzel to me.

696
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,680
Brothers ain't getting
nor giving no love now.

697
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,320
I don't want to complain, but
my doctor says l'm suffering...

698
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,960
from underloved syndrome.

699
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,600
Maybe it is a conspiracy.
But do folks still fear...

700
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,040
the black man's sexuality
like that?

701
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,280
A fear that could be wiped out
just by seeing us love...

702
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,360
not by race, but by heart.

703
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,800
And can't a brother
get some love?

704
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,840
Now, that, Catherine...

705
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,320
is a question
for the screen pages...

706
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,640
written by folks
who rarely look like me...

707
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,120
but want to see me
run and jump and shoot...

708
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,200
but don't care to see me kiss
a woman with my skin tone...

709
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,600
and would shoot me if I were
kissing a woman of their hue.

710
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,040
Who are you?

711
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,400
Who are you? Who are we?

712
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,160
We are human, too...

713
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,600
and we love loving, and...

714
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,800
can't a brother get some love?

715
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,560
That's the state of being...

716
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,520
a chocolate leading man
in Hollywood today.

717
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,880
(Click)

718
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:07,920
I keep bringing it up...

719
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,040
I keep bringing it up...

720
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,200
because I don't want you
to think I forgot.

721
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,080
Look, you just pay me back
when you have all of it.

722
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,240
-I have half now, so--

-Keep it. I don't want--

723
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
-lt just feels awkward.
-Please.

724
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,360
-Hi.
-Right this way.

725
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,560
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

726
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,760
What would you like
to start with?

727
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,560
Some evian or pellegrino?

728
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,960
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

729
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,960
You still going on your weekend
with that guy from the internet?

730
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,360
Mm-hmm.
No, I haven't cancelled.

731
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm putting myself out there.
I'm going.

732
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,560
Good.
You need money for that.

733
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,480
You want me to meet men,

and l'm meeting men.

734
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,640
You could meet men there.
There'll be plenty.

735
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,840
I can't come tonight.
I can't.

736
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,920
On the internet?
How is that meeting?

737
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,120
It's encountering.

738
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,320
What airline are you flying?

739
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,520
Southwest.

740
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
-Southwest?
-Yeah.

741
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,440
That's a good airline.

742
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
Southwest, younger man...

743
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,160
new underwear, Tucson,

Holiday lnn.

744
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,360
What is your point?

745
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,880
Have you ever stayed
at a Holiday lnn?

746
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,360
No. Have you?

747
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,960
I think that's what's
really bothering me.

748
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,160
You know what, Lee?

He's paying for it.

749
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
So if that's what's
really bothering you--

750
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
-What does he do?
-He's an artist.

751
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,240
-An actor.
-A painter.

752
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,400
In Tucson?

753
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
Yeah. He says the desert
inspires him.

754
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,360
-Lend me what?
-What is wrong with you?

755
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,440
Seriously. what is wrong
with you right now?

756
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Friday. Fridays are good.
T. G. I. F. Fridays are good. Lee.

757
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,480
You're acting insane.

758
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm going to have the squash.

759
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,680
But this is
a boundary issue. man!

760
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,600
What I do off-stage is
my process and my business. OK?

761
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,280
And I don't care
what anybody thinks.

762
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,400
And it's my business
to put on a play.

763
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,120
And now l've got three hours
to find a new Eva Braun.

764
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,400
Oh, OK. You know what?

Fuck her.

765
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,520
And here's why. Number one--

766
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,000
anyone who's offended
by drinking blood...

767
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
obviously doesn't drink blood.

768
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,840
Number two--anybody who drinks
as much blood as I do...

769
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,720
knows it has no effect.

770
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,560
Number three--

771
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,040
there is absolutely
no scientific connection...

772
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,880
between drinking
a shot of blood a day...

773
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,760
and being
an extraordinary actor.

774
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,360
And number 4--it is impossible
to prove number 3.

775
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,440
You know, do the words Masai

mean anything to you?

776
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,840
Do you know who that is?

777
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,040
Yeah. Herzog made
a documentary about them.

778
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,240
The herdsmen of fire.
warriors of Africa.

779
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,840
They drank blood.

780
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,920
Jack fucking LaLanne
drank blood in the fifties.

781
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,720
Yeah. granted.
his wife wouldn't kiss him...

782
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,280
but this is bullshit. man.

783
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,320
I don't care what you do
outside of this theater.

784
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,600
I don't give a shit. You could
eat the ass out of a dead wolf.

785
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,520
I don't care.

786
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,760
Just keep it to yourself, OK?

787
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,160
Just keep it to yourself.

788
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,560
I think it's fucking hysterical
that she walked.

789
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,600
And I know comedy.

790
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,040
LINDA: I don't understand.

791
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,720
I don't understand
what's wrong.

792
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,200
I mean. birthdays are fun.

793
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,680
Well, OK, this is mom

when I was four...

794
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,800
at my birthday
introducing me to people.

795
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,200
And this is Lee. She ruined
my body, didn't you, dear?

796
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,800
-There.
-Thanks.

797
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
I won't be here tomorrow.
so happy birthday.

798
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Oh. It's smaller than the gift
you gave me last year...

799
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,280
for my fortieth birthday.

800
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,200
You know what. Lee. you make
forty a bigger deal than it is.

801
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,960
You have no idea about forty.

802
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,760
I'll be forty.

803
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,560
What did I give you last year?
I don't even remember.

804
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,600
You know, that--that thing.
That...

805
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,920
-Oh. You didn't like it?
-No.

806
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,440
Well. honestly.
I would have rather had...

807
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,120
just. Iike.
a card or something.

808
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,440
OK. God.

809
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,840
It's just a weird gift
to give your sister...

810
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,880
who's married.
on her fortieth birthday.

811
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
You know what Gus gave me
last year for my birthday?

812
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,800
First edition of Bernard Shaw's
The Sanity of Art.

813
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,400
Did you get anything out of it?

814
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,720
-Which?
-The gift I gave you.

815
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
Are you kidding?

816
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,040
No. I mean, yes or no.

817
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,520
But for my fortieth birthday?

818
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,400
Well, I have one, so...

819
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,440
I used it once.

820
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,040
OK. All right.
Well, what happened?

821
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,200
Um, I got stuck in the chair.

822
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,760
You used it in a chair?

823
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,400
Well, yeah,
that's what's on the box.

824
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,000
Different ways. I've never...

825
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,360
Not in a chair. I've never...

826
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,520
Well...

827
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,400
gift-giving--
you know, it's an art.

828
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,800
You should have
the person in mind--

829
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,320
OK, l'm sorry. I thought
you'd like it. I like it--

830
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,600
Well. that's--
but you should give people...

831
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,160
what you think
they would want--

832
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,680
you know. something personal.

833
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,000
How much more personal
could that be?

834
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But then. you and that guy--
what was his name?

835
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,280
-Tom.
-Tom.

836
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,880
Yeah. You sat at
the other end of the table...

837
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,760
and just stared
at each other the whole time.

838
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,720
You didn't even
really socialize.

839
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Lee, forgive me, OK?

840
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,240
I happened to be in love--
for a brief period of time.

841
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,880
Once--which happened
to include...

842
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,240
the week of your birthday.

843
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,800
-This is all a year later.
-You don't get it.

844
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,520
Christ!

845
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,120
You know what?
Gift--it's a gift.

846
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,800
A gift is a gift.
Don't question it.

847
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,240
At least not to the giver
and out loud a whole year later.

848
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,000
Chr--

849
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,360
-OK, now I know.

-What?

850
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,920
Well, that it meant something
to you.

851
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,880
What?

852
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,280
Just the whole thing,
that you put thought into it.

853
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,480
You know.
it's for your small change.

854
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,520
FRANCESCA: So he gives me
this injection...

855
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,320
and I become invisible.

856
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,000
And I can do anything. right?

857
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,840
Because. you know.
I'm invisible.

858
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,760
What do I do? I go to
one of my colleagues. Carl...

859
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,760
and I make him
sign a confession...

860
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,960
while I hold a knife
to his neck.

861
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,120
Now. it's just weird.
because I really like Carl.

862
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,360
He's a brilliant,

talented man...

863
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,040
completely misunderstood
by his boss.

864
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,840
Well, you know, l'm not
surprised he was in my dream...

865
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,040
really, because
I think of him a lot.

866
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,600
I think l'm actually--

867
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,200
MAN: Wheel in Nicholas.
We're ready for him.

868
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,480
It's funny, because
he's one of these guys--

869
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,200
You know what?
I want to tell you...

870
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,560
what I think about that,

but I gotta go do this.

871
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,160
OK. I'll be here--listening.

872
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,520
Hey, Pitty.

873
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
(Laughs)

874
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,000
Hey, man. What's going on?

875
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,960
OK, exactly the same thing.
We're starting from over here.

876
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,280
It took me a little bit--

877
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,480
I needed to do this
with track...

878
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,640
instead of just the walk-up...

879
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,360
so we're gonna do
a little bit of a push-in.

880
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,200
There's probably
going to be some focus stuff...

881
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,680
so we're gonna shoot a few.

882
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,840
OK.

883
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,520
But just split the extras
as they come through--

884
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,840
don't be precious about it.

885
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,360
Tell them we're coming through.

886
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,640
I will, I will.

887
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,040
R-1 39, take one.

888
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,280
(Man muttering)

889
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,720
And background action--action!

890
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,440
Move! Move!

891
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,560
-Out of the way!
-Goddamn it.

892
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,040
Uh, looks like we're late.

893
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,120
Looks like.

894
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,480
Back to square one.

895
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,440
That's what he thinks.

896
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,320
You think different?

897
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,480
Like the back
of my big ten-inch.

898
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,000
-Oh.
-Come on.

899
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,400
(Sighs)

900
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
CARL: One minute
I'm drinking a beer...

901
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,320
and the next minute
I'm unemployed.

902
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,640
How does that happen?

903
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,160
(Laughs)

904
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,000
He said I have confused...

905
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,040
my personality quirks
with standards.

906
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,000
What the fuck?

907
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,480
CARL: You have no idea
what I have lost just now.

908
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,160
This goes way beyond this job.
I could lose everything.

909
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,720
The ripple effect.
It's the ripple effect.

910
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,240
It's like. Oh. yeah.
by the way. you're fired. 

911
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,440
Oh. yeah. honey. by the way...

912
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,320
uh. you don 't think
I'm so great.

913
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,680
Guess what? They don 't think
I'm so great at work.

914
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,160
Hey. maybe I'm not so great. 

915
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,600
Hey. that's simple.
Well. there. I can write that.

916
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,760
I can write.
I'm not so great. 

917
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,160
Maybe I can write it...

918
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,880
a hundred-fucking-thousand
times on a blackboard--

919
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,320
Oh. I can teach.
I used to teach.

920
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,440
I love teaching.
I do love teaching.

921
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,000
R-1 39, take 49, mark!

922
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,720
MAN: OK. here we go!
And background! Action!

923
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,040
BRAD: Move!

924
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,680
-Out of the way!
-Move!

925
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,600
-Move!
-Out of the way!

926
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Ohh. Looks like we're late.

927
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,400
Looks like.

928
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,320
Back to square one.

929
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,160
That's what he thinks.

930
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,520
You think different?

931
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,920
(Both panting)

932
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,080
I know different.

933
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,600
Come on.

934
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,120
(Sighs)

935
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,760
-Cut it!
-OK. we got.

936
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,400
Nice one.

937
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,920
Very nice, very nice.

938
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,280
Check the gate. Check the gate.

939
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,880
BRAD: Lunch?

940
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,320
OK.

941
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,640
So, David, David.

You need me for anything?

942
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,840
No, no. Absolutely.
Lunch--go ahead.

943
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,280
-Nice scene, man.

-Yeah, thanks, Brad.

944
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,480
Thanks.

945
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,320
Would you not take a role
if you felt...

946
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,200
the people of the black
community wouldn't like it?

947
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,000
Hmm.

948
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,480
This guy that lives
in my neighborhood--

949
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,960
Iives right across the street
from me.

950
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,160
And he dresses like--
yeah, yeah.

951
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,200
He dresses like a vampire
twenty-four hours a day.

952
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,600
I don't know if he's got a job.
I don't know what he does...

953
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,000
but I know
he dresses like a vampire...

954
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,360
Iike Dracula all the damn time.

955
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,000
-You want to go?
-Mm.

956
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,840
I mean, look,

I see this guy at Pavilion's...

957
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,000
buying romaine lettuce
dressed as Dracula...

958
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,680
so you got to figure...

959
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,680
he's an actor, right?
He's got to be.

960
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,000
Well, you could find out.

961
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,040
Yeah. The point is, the answer
to your question is...

962
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,120
if I needed the money,
abso-fucking-lutely.

963
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,120
Absolutely.
Now, am I proud of that?

964
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,480
No.
But, yeah, l'd take it...

965
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,920
'cause, look,

a brother's got to eat.

966
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,240
-OK. Are they gonna say cut?
-I don't know.

967
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,720
OK, what's going on?

968
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,800
-OK, can somebody--
-Did they call cut?

969
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,480
Well, can somebody
communicate--OK.

970
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,840
Bonnie, Bonnie, this is

itching me so bad today.

971
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,680
Fran, listen, listen.

Hey, after lunch...

972
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,280
next time we do this.
could you give me...

973
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,480
more to work with
on this whole attraction--

974
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
What do you mean?
That was good, huh?

975
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,320
We can't hear in there, though.
We can't hear anything.

976
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
No, 'cause l'm not feeling
the whole sexual chemistry.

977
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,520
No, no, but remember...

978
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,760
you gotta leave yourself
somewhere to go...

979
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,800
for the second letter
at the airport.

980
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,680
All right. Oh!
All right, all right.

981
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,240
Right?

982
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,640
In the way it's got to build...

983
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,800
you got to give me
something to go on.

984
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,680
-We had it going before.
-Did he call?

985
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,640
-Yeah.
-lt's not working for me.

986
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,120
OK, well, if you're
going to stay for lunch...

987
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,640
Iet's talk about
whatever it is--

988
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,440
No. I gotta run an errand,
so next time--and maybe it's me.

989
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,640
All right.

990
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,280
We'll figure it out.
Don't worry about it.

991
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,120
All right. I think it was good!
Oh. thanks.

992
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,920
No, it's the movie.

This is the only movie.

993
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,400
As far as he's concerned,

it's the only movie.

994
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,600
CALVIN: Hey. can you
hold that door for me?

995
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,800
-Sure.
-Thank you.

996
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,080
Got it?

997
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,960
Excuse me.

998
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,880
CARL: Oh. the film.
Well. the film--

999
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,600
Artie and I wrote this.

1000
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,120
We started working together--

1001
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,240
really writing together.
about a year ago.

1002
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
We tossed around
a couple of ideas.

1003
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,800
And Artie's a pretty good
playwright in his own right.

1004
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,920
And we thought.
you know. maybe this--

1005
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,360
sort of my understanding
of Hollywood and everything...

1006
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,040
and his ability
to actually write...

1007
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
would be a good combination...

1008
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,120
and so we came up
with this idea...

1009
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,640
for what is now
Rendezvous. the movie.

1010
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,040
It's almost like a spy film
in the intrigue...

1011
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,280
of this romantic encounter...

1012
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,040
between this guy
that Calvin plays--

1013
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,360
I'm sorry. there's a...

1014
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
Uh. and this woman.

1015
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,400
And anyway.
I think it's a neat story.

1016
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,040
And I think it's a great cast.

1017
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:49,040
Um. uh. but. uh...

1018
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,040
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I have some--it's weird.

1019
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,320
I'm really happy about
the project. I really am.

1020
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,560
I got--you know. there's--
I've got issues with some of--

1021
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,080
Actually. Calvin. Calvin is.
I think. I don 't know--

1022
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,400
You know. other people...

1023
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,840
get more excited about him
than I do.

1024
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,760
It's not to say I'm not happy
having him on the movie.

1025
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,640
I think that's great. and
I'm sure he's very good in it.

1026
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,520
I just don't get what
the big thing is with Calvin.

1027
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,800
I think--you know. you picture
a role in a certain way...

1028
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,640
And sometimes it's--
I'm not always right. either.

1029
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,480
I know. you know. certainly
my wife thinks he's great.

1030
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,280
(Heavy breathing)

1031
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,520
(Shuts door)

1032
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,360
FRANCESCA:
I'm starving to death.

1033
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,400
-Well, l've got it right here.
-I might actually faint.

1034
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,040
OK, tuna. No celery.

1035
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,760
No celery and no...

1036
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,560
-Onion.
-Right.

1037
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,000
Uh. so listen...

1038
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,200
you know that thing
that we were talking about?

1039
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,720
Um. I can't keep--

1040
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,400
OK. I mean--

1041
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,080
-Come on, come on.

-OK, OK.

1042
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,480
I'm uncomfortable dealing
with this aspect of your life.

1043
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,160
I don't want to talk to them.

1044
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,000
Well. I don't want
to talk to them. either.

1045
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,080
I don't even want to talk
to the guys l'm dating.

1046
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,880
Uh-huh.
Well. I'm not dating anyone.

1047
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,800
A date is not dating.

1048
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,680
Well, you know,
someone buys you dinner...

1049
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,640
you owe them a phone call,
in my opinion.

1050
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,160
See. dinner--
that's where I fucked up.

1051
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,760
It should have been lunch,

because lunch is meaningless.

1052
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,360
They all seem pretty nice
to me.

1053
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,520
Well, they don't strike you as,
like, networky, freaky...

1054
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
actress-dating
executive types...

1055
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,240
with their water bottles
in, like, a mesh tote bag?

1056
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,560
This is really--
this is disgusting.

1057
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,040
I can't eat this.
That arugula is so bitter.

1058
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
It's like
my algebra teacher on bread.

1059
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,560
-OK.
-Ugh.

1060
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,400
I'm truly, l'm--look at me.

1061
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,560
I'm gonna faint.
I might actually faint.

1062
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,000
We all know how you get
when your blood sugar's low.

1063
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,240
All right. I'll be right back.

1064
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,520
OK. Thank you.

1065
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,240
-You're welcome.
-I need some wet naps, too.

1066
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,840
-OK.
-Tuna fingers.

1067
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,840
-Don't want tuna fingers.
-No, we don't.

1068
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,680
-You're an angel. Thank you.
-Oh, you're welcome.

1069
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,200
Oh. post-its!

1070
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,680
LEE: See. I knew
something was wrong. I just--

1071
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,520
I didn't know it was that.

1072
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,000
I had that one this morning.

1073
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,200
(Kisses)

1074
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,520
CALVlN: Hey...

1075
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,440
I need to talk to you
about something.

1076
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,400
-Lee--
-Don't.

1077
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,520
(Cell phone ringing)

1078
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,040
(Ring)

1079
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,240
Why did you even pursue this?

1080
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,360
What? Wait a minute.
You came over and spoke to me.

1081
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,280
Now, all of this began
because of you.

1082
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,200
Are you saying
you weren't attracted to me?

1083
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,400
No--

1084
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,560
Gus told me
to watch out for you.

1085
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,960
Gus told me
to watch out for you.

1086
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,760
I'm forty-one tomorrow,
Calvin--

1087
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,160
the age where
I could have a stroke...

1088
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,480
in the middle of the night.

1089
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,560
If you think l'm not going
to Gus', you're...

1090
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,480
OK, I have a meeting.
Go fuck somebody else.

1091
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,440
-Hey.
-Hi.

1092
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,120
-You're still here?
-Yeah, I was just upstairs.

1093
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,960
I was shopping
for my friend Gus.

1094
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,800
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1095
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,640
-Are you OK?
-Oh, yeah, l'm good.

1096
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,280
I've just had really some
sad cases today, so l'm just--

1097
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,480
-l'm sorry.
-l'm emotional.

1098
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,120
Yeah.
What did you get him?

1099
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,160
-Who?
-What did you get Gus?

1100
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,120
Oh. They didn't have it.

1101
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,720
-What was it?
-Yeah.

1102
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,480
-Are you...
-lt was a thing.

1103
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,640
He's--he's, uh...

1104
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,000
It was--they didn't--you know,
'cause he's forty today...

1105
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and I was just gonna get him
some, I don't know, this--

1106
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,320
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

1107
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,200
I just have to go.
I'm really late, so--

1108
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,640
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1109
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,520
I'll call you later.

1110
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,280
Oh, OK.

1111
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,920
Thank you.

1112
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:43,840
Um, you need to find him.

1113
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,800
Um, you need to find him.

1114
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,720
I don't know if he knows
l'm here at the office...

1115
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,440
so I have to have a contact
name in order to transfer you.

1116
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,440
Um. Harvey's not here
at the office right now.

1117
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,600
He sees on the TV a murder...

1118
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,800
and as he listens to the murder,

he just goes white.

1119
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,320
His whole face
just goes white...

1120
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,800
and he bolts
from his apartment.

1121
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,320
Now. we follow him.

1122
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,720
The murders--they deviate
at this key point...

1123
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,720
for reasons nobody can
understand. because--

1124
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,080
T ell Trevors l'm not gonna
do it. I'm not gonna do it.

1125
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,720
Good, good. Go. Sorry. Go ahead.

1126
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,160
Aah.

1127
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,960
My brother Bob
should look at this.

1128
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,120
Yeah. Good. Good!

1129
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,280
-Great.
-Good.

1130
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,400
CALVlN: Motherfuckers.

1131
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,800
Did you see their faces
looking at us?

1132
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,920
Yes.

1133
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,760
It was like a labrador
staring at a Picasso.

1134
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,920
Right.

1135
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,280
Ed, we walked in there

with a china cup.

1136
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,120
-They want beer mugs.
-Yeah, right?

1137
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,520
I could so see myself
in that part.

1138
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,760
Right?

1139
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,280
Fuck!

1140
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,560
-lt's all right.
-All right, I gotta go.

1141
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,960
-See you later.
-See you.

1142
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,080
Hey, Ed, keep the faith.

1143
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,600
It was good. It was good.

1144
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,680
-Mr. Liveright.
-Hey, hey. Bill.

1145
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,240
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

1146
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,400
-Ann?
-Yeah.

1147
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,640
My massage is here.
I'll call you back in an hour.

1148
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,960
-How about in back? Good?
-OK, sure.

1149
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Um, what do you think
about the lighting?

1150
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,480
A little light--too bright?

1151
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,840
Whatever you're comfortable
with is fine. Yeah.

1152
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,840
I think a little darker.

1153
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,320
-Like so.
-Sure.

1154
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,560
-Need some help?
-No.

1155
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,600
Done it before, huh?

1156
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,040
Bill Liveright--great name.

1157
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,200
Well, a name with a message
is a good name, right?

1158
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,080
I don't know.
It just always eluded me.

1159
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,880
Mmm.
Money is just feminine energy.

1160
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,680
Huh. It always seems so male.
I don't get it.

1161
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,960
Money: Mater. The Latin.

1162
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,440
You connect with that,

and you're golden.

1163
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,480
You make it sound pretty simple.

1164
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,000
-lt is.
-Just connecting with it.

1165
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,800
You're catching on, Ann.

1166
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,560
Look, don't be

one of the confused people.

1167
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,840
If you have purpose,
you can just wade right through.

1168
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,960
It's like running past
people who are asleep.

1169
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,880
OK...

1170
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,080
you can turn over now.

1171
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,960
I think I kind of drooled
a little bit.

1172
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,640
Just scoot your head down.
so you're not in the hole.

1173
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,600
(Exhales)

1174
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,240
OK.

1175
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,040
You're from L.A.?

1176
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,800
No. Miami, actually. You?

1177
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,600
-New York.
-Oh.

1178
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,440
(Sniffs)

1179
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,240
Do you find me attractive?

1180
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,320
What?

1181
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,560
Yes.

1182
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,960
In what sort of way?

1183
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,440
In a human sort of way.

1184
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
-Ann.
-Bill.

1185
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,920
It's my birthday, Ann.

1186
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,080
-Really?
-Yeah.

1187
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,480
Happy birthday.

1188
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,520
What's your philosophy
on release?

1189
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,880
You know what, Bill, I know

where you're going with this...

1190
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,120
and the thing is,
I don't do it, so...

1191
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,160
Right. Not even
for a little extra money?

1192
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,800
Mm-mmm. It's not
the kind of massage I do.

1193
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,960
Right.

1194
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,040
I offer a release
of tension and toxins...

1195
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,560
and sometimes emotion, but...

1196
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,280
Yes, well,

that's what l'm talking about.

1197
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,920
-Well, I don't do it, so--

-lt would take thirty seconds.

1198
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,320
Oh, yeah.
You can come in thirty seconds?

1199
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,200
-Do you have a second-hand?
-Look, I can't do it.

1200
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,560
You could stop
after thirty seconds.

1201
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,040
Five hundred dollars.
When was the last time...

1202
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,760
you made five hundred dollars
for thirty seconds of work?

1203
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,880
-You're cruel.
-l'm not cruel, l'm practical.

1204
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,880
You need the cash,

I need the release.

1205
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,760
This is crazy.

1206
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,480
Five hundred dollars, Ann.

1207
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,440
You can't make any noise.

1208
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,800
-The place is noisy.
-No. You can audibly exhale.

1209
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,280
You can't moan or grunt or sigh.

1210
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,560
I can't moan or grunt or sigh,
just audible exhale only?

1211
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,600
-Yes.
-Ahh!

1212
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,640
No. Too loud. And if
you do it--it's too much.

1213
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,160
I'll be quiet.
OK, Ann, l'll be quiet.

1214
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,800
Are you ready?

1215
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,560
Fuck.

1216
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,920
Are you ready?

1217
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,720
Will you just hand me
that plastic bag right there?

1218
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,320
Well. why?

1219
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,880
No reason.

1220
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,280
(Sighs)

1221
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,080
Oh.

1222
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,760
Oh, my God.

1223
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,920
Ahem.

1224
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,560
-Here.
-Thank you.

1225
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,040
GUS: Shit.

1226
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,000
-Hey, Ann?
-What?

1227
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,400
I'm sorry.
I thought I had more cash on me.

1228
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
-That's OK, Bill.

-I saw an ATM in the lobby.

1229
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,120
You know what? There's a limit.

1230
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,640
There's a limit.

1231
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,280
To the machine. You can only
get three hundred dollars out.

1232
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,560
Could you move that, please?
That bag.

1233
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,000
-You're kidding.
-No, l'm not kidding.

1234
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,240
-I feel bad.
-You should.

1235
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,400
You should feel
really bad and ashamed.

1236
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,920
It's...

1237
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,520
-Hold on.
-Forget it.

1238
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,280
-Just hold on a second.
-You know what? Forget it.

1239
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,440
It's pathetic.

1240
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,320
Mater equals money.  I mean.
give me a fucking break.

1241
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,960
All the world loves a winner.

1242
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,600
You know why
they love the winner?

1243
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,440
Because they think
he knows something.

1244
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,880
I mean, he had to know

something in order to win.

1245
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,240
So, we admire him.

1246
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:40,040
But the winner doesn't
learn anything from winning.

1247
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,320
No, the loser--the loser

learns something about himself.

1248
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,800
Losing teaches you
about yourself.

1249
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,240
So. the loser's the winner.

1250
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,920
I don't know. I mean.
it's not in actual terms.

1251
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,920
I'm speaking figuratively.

1252
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,240
(Elevator doors open)

1253
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,120
Sorry. Excuse me.

1254
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,320
-Good night, Denny.
-May I see you, please?

1255
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,080
The gentleman in 205
left this for you.

1256
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,400
Oh. Huh.

1257
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,280
Wow. That was nice.

1258
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,960
GUS: Ann. thanks
for the happy ending. Bill.

1259
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,880
Nice card.

1260
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,600
(Opens bottle)

1261
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,280
Django?

1262
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,640
Django? Hey, hey, hey!

1263
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,480
(Clapping) Sweetie-pie?

1264
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,920
Dja--

1265
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,760
(Hums)

1266
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,640
LEE:
I know what they say.

1267
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,960
I know what they say
about me--

1268
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,360
my colleagues...

1269
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,360
and my family.

1270
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,000
I don't--fucking movies.

1271
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,640
OK, let's fucking go.

1272
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,680
Fucking movies!

1273
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,840
Fucking overpaid, fucking
unhappy childhood fuckers.

1274
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,640
Fucking movie fucking fuckers.

1275
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,320
Let's go! Somebody--
Jesus, buddy!

1276
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,440
Uh, do you think somebody else
could go?

1277
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,480
Maybe one of us could
fucking cross the street?

1278
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,400
Fucking movie cop!

1279
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,640
Hey. fucking movie cop!

1280
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,360
Could I maybe
fucking cross the street?

1281
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,440
Francesca Davis. Fuck.

1282
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,560
Yes. He's gonna get--what?
Dehydrated? OK.

1283
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,640
Yes. Yeah, I understand.

Thank you.

1284
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,280
Hello. Yeah, hi.

1285
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,360
(Clears throat)
I did that...

1286
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,920
and--and I gave him
some water, yeah...

1287
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,120
and I was just hoping
that Dr. Green could come by...

1288
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,160
and, uh, and give him
a quick look.

1289
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,960
Oh, he is?

1290
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,000
Oh, I see. Uh...

1291
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,320
Yeah?

1292
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,640
Well, if--you know,
I just--I just, uh...

1293
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,280
want to make sure
he's not gonna die...

1294
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,840
you know, or anything.

1295
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,080
Um, so if you could,
that would be great.

1296
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,800
Right, heh heh. Yeah.

1297
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,080
Uh, that's fantastic.

1298
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,120
Yes, I will see you then.

1299
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,600
Yes. What? The address?

1300
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,400
Oh. Oh, my address. Oh, yeah.

1301
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,320
I guess you'd need that,
wouldn't you? Heh heh.

1302
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,040
(Alarm chirps)

1303
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,040
(Cell phone rings)

1304
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,880
Hi.

1305
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
I know.
You know, I can't really talk.

1306
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,760
I'm going into a store.
Can I call you back?

1307
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,960
OK.

1308
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,320
Oh, really?

1309
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,520
Oh that'd be--
that's--that's great.

1310
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,320
I'm--l'm glad.

1311
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,000
You met Gus?

1312
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,760
Where? Wow.
Yeah, well, there's a guy...

1313
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,000
who could change your life,
you know?

1314
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,560
(Sighs)

1315
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,160
So, l'm gonna get the dress.

1316
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,360
-Oh, good. Great.
-Yeah.

1317
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,600
LINDA: Mm-hmm. Sure.

1318
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,440
Yeah. I was. um. fat...

1319
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,280
overweight. and very short...

1320
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,800
and. um. I hadn't
gone through puberty.

1321
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,440
So. yeah. I mean. I looked.
you know--I did not look...

1322
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,000
Iike I would've liked
to have looked in high school.

1323
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,520
Yeah. surely I would've
changed my social status.

1324
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,360
I still would. Heh heh. Yeah.

1325
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,480
Treat myself.

1326
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,000
So, that's five there.

1327
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,080
Oh, great. Thank you very much.

1328
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,920
-OK.
-Excellent. Thank you.

1329
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,000
Hey, you came. I thought
you were coming later.

1330
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,160
No.

1331
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,680
Hey. How are you, man?
Good to see you.

1332
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,680
The house is open, guys,
if you want to...

1333
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,200
-Oh. Hi, Dee.

-lt's good to see you.

1334
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,560
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

1335
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,720
Good.

1336
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,000
That guy didn't pay.

1337
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,160
Did you pay, sir?

1338
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,720
MAN: I did. yes.
Would you like--

1339
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,960
No, no. I just--I saw you
come the other way...

1340
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,759
and most people were coming...
I'm sorry.

1341
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,640
Right in here.
Right there on the sofa.

1342
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,799
Oh, boy.

1343
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,759
What else was in the brownies
besides chocolate?

1344
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:32,440
Um...

1345
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,960
-Hash?
-Yeah.

1346
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,600
Aw, come on, man.

1347
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,839
No. My wife
brought it back from London.

1348
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,560
We made the brownies
for my friend's fortieth--

1349
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,720
So, what'd you do,
leave it out for him to eat?

1350
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,799
No, no. I know.

When I left it, look...

1351
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,080
it was right here
on this counter.

1352
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,600
I didn't think
he could jump that high.

1353
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,680
He's got little legs like a...

1354
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,000
All this--he ate all this.

1355
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,360
It's so much better than pot,
right?

1356
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,000
-Uh--
-Aw, no, no, no.

1357
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,760
You don't understand,

you don't understand.

1358
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,160
I haven't smoked that in years,
so, you know what l'm saying?

1359
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,760
Goddamn.

1360
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,560
When I was in my twenties,
this guitar player and l...

1361
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,800
would make up all these lyrics
while he played...

1362
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,640
and our songs would end up...

1363
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,440
with all these fucked-up
rhyme schemes.

1364
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,680
Heather. Heather, l'm sorry.
Is he going to be all right?

1365
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,600
Oh, he's going to be fine.
He's going to be fine.

1366
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,120
So, uh...

1367
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,760
you going to throw that out?

1368
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,680
(Saxophone playing)

1369
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,640
Look, you liked it...

1370
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,160
and you've told me
you haven't liked things.

1371
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,680
You liked it. Man, listen.

I don't want you telling me...

1372
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,840
you're not going to pursue
any more meetings...

1373
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,200
because
this is what I want to do.

1374
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,160
I'm serious. OK?

1375
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,920
Hey. Iisten. Could you. Iike...

1376
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,240
It's better now.
It's a lot better now.

1377
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,440
Ed and l,

we've been working on it.

1378
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,600
We've been
beefing up the scenes.

1379
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,840
And that whole thing
you mentioned...

1380
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,480
I agree with you--
about me being in it.

1381
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,840
I'm not going to do it.

1382
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,360
Even if they ask about it.
we're not going to build it in.

1383
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,680
I figure. you know.
in the long run...

1384
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,400
it's probably a good thing...

1385
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,680
me trying to establish myself
as a writer instead of an actor.

1386
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,600
Like Pinter. You know. Pinter.
he was an actor.

1387
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,960
He started off as an actor.

1388
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,440
He still acts. occasionally.

1389
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,240
All right, this shit
is cyclical, you know that?

1390
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,600
All right. don't.
Don't. don't. don't.

1391
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,840
I got it.

1392
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,280
OK. Thank you.

1393
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,280
(Line ringing)

1394
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,000
If you stop telling me
that that letter makes sense...

1395
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,920
you can throw up all you want.
How about that?

1396
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,600
Tch. Yeah. Aw.

1397
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,000
Do you know her?

1398
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,800
-Ahem. Who?
-Carl's wife.

1399
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,760
Nuh-uh.

1400
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,440
That's kind of funny, because
l've heard things, actually.

1401
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,240
Yeah. Yeah.
A couple of them.

1402
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:05,640
-Hey, how are you doing?
-Uhh.

1403
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,680
Hey, Fran, listen,
I want you to meet--

1404
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,800
Frannie. It's Lucy Morgan.
L.A. Magazine.

1405
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,120
-l'm sorry. I--
-The Sedona piece.

1406
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,040
Oh, my God. Yes. Oh, wow.

1407
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,320
Wow. You changed your hair
or something?

1408
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,160
Yeah. How do you know Cal?

1409
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,360
-Uh. we--
-It was a dinner.

1410
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,280
Yeah.

1411
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,960
Excuse me.

1412
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,400
Hey.

1413
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,920
Hi.

1414
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,520
Is it--is it upstairs,
or is it in there?

1415
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,800
God.

1416
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,080
-Oh, this is wrong.
-No.

1417
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,760
-l'm overdressed.
-You look...

1418
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,720
-I wasn't sure what...
-lt's on the roof.

1419
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,960
Where's Carl?

1420
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,160
He's not here yet.
I just, um...

1421
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,320
-We should go up and...
-OK.

1422
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,360
-Wow.
-You OK?

1423
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,960
Yeah.

1424
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,160
You know,

I wish I didn't have this on.

1425
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,560
No. You look great.

1426
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,400
Well...

1427
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,640
You know, I have to admire you
for your belief...

1428
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,400
in this project.
but the reality...

1429
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,280
is a whole different thing
altogether.

1430
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,720
It's all marketplace shit.

1431
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,160
And I don't think that
this is a good role for you...

1432
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,440
so don't even push that.

1433
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,000
When does this article
come out?

1434
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,240
In a couple of months.

1435
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,760
Well, you call me...

1436
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,480
if you can't get any answers
out of this guy.

1437
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,280
Thank you.

1438
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,880
Nice to meet you.

1439
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,520
Nice seeing you.

1440
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,520
Huh?

1441
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,360
Huh?

1442
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,600
Meltzin. 

1443
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,880
Name kind of suits him.
Oh, Nicholas.

1444
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,600
No, it looks good.
Where'd you get that dress?

1445
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,440
No, it looks good.
Where'd you get that dress?

1446
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,000
-Seaver.
-Where?

1447
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,080
On Third. Do you know it?

1448
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,040
-ls it good?
-Yeah.

1449
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,400
-lt was on sale. I like it.
-No, it's...

1450
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,760
Oh.

1451
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,400
God.

1452
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,440
All chromium is not bad,

though...

1453
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,240
because
I get Fitness magazine...

1454
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,920
I need a drink.

1455
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,360
No. I'm saying there's
a lot of good chromiums.

1456
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,360
-I read it in a magazine.
-Hey.

1457
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,120
Hey. I wouldn't go
to the lengths...

1458
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,120
of bathing in bottled water,
that's all l'm saying.

1459
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,480
I believe what you're saying.

1460
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,480
-Franny Davis?
-Yeah.

1461
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,960
Sam Osborne.

1462
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,600
-l'm sorry.
-The Duchess of Malfi.

1463
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,960
-Birchers.
-Yeah.

1464
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,720
I was the lighting guy.

1465
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,240
Mmm. Oh, my God. Oh, OK. Yeah.

1466
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,920
-Sam Osborne.
-Osborne.

1467
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,440
-How are you?
-Nice to see you again.

1468
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,560
Oh, you, too. Wow. That's funny.

1469
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,720
-Yeah.
-That's--

1470
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,320
Do you remember when you said...

1471
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,480
l feel like a waitress
on vacation?

1472
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,800
Oh, God.

1473
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,040
It was, like, just the cutest
thing l've ever heard, and...

1474
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,240
I don't know why
that just stuck out.

1475
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,840
I don't--yeah.
I just--um, well...

1476
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,200
-I was going to go...
-OK.

1477
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,640
Jesus. You remember that?

1478
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,440
Yeah.

1479
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,680
Yeah, I do.

1480
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,200
-I got a funny memory that way.
-Oh.

1481
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,160
Anyway, hey,
l--I don't want to bug you.

1482
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,560
I know you got
lots of people to see.

1483
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,640
I just wanted to say
how happy I am for you, and...

1484
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,880
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

1485
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,360
It's--I always thought
you had something special.

1486
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,120
This...

1487
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,360
You know, it's just amazing
what you've been able to do...

1488
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,600
-well, from...

-From nothing. Ha ha ha!

1489
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,440
Or, well...yeah.

1490
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,920
No. I'm just--l'm--thank you.
Thank you.

1491
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,160
Right. Good. Well, hey...

1492
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,720
-Cheers. Good to see you.
-Thank you. Cheers.

1493
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,080
I couldn't Cheers you.
I don't have a drink...

1494
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,280
but, well, shit,

Sam Osborne...

1495
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,120
Ha ha!
Birchers lighting guy.

1496
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,280
Birchers.

1497
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,640
Get me a--
why don't you come with me?

1498
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,160
(Laughs)

1499
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,920
-Yeah. OK.
-OK.

1500
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,160
-Nicholas. Oh, my goodness.
-Oh, God.

1501
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,160
-Uhh.
-Let's get you on the sofa.

1502
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,400
-Oh, God, did I just--
-Yes, you did.

1503
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,400
-Ohh.
-Go slowly.

1504
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,800
Ah, Catherine, l'm sorry.

1505
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,960
Are you all right?

1506
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,680
-Here's some water.
-Oh, thank you so much.

1507
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,760
-I feel a little light headed.
-Here, have some water.

1508
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,480
-Yeah.
-Drink it.

1509
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,840
Yeah?
Are you sure you're all right?

1510
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,880
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank goodness.

1511
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,920
-I need to ask you something.
-What?

1512
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,360
I need you to come back
to New York with me.

1513
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,120
-Nicholas, I can't--

-No. It's the letter.

1514
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,240
Catherine, it's that letter.

I can't get it out of my head.

1515
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,560
Well, but that was--

1516
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,440
I've never had anybody
write me a love letter.

1517
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,120
-Never.
-But I just--

1518
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,360
No, listen.

You come back to New York.

1519
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,600
You're here.
You there just makes sense.

1520
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:57,120
You write the article,

and--and we go from there.

1521
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,440
Nicholas, these kind of things--

1522
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,960
A moment of inspiration...

1523
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,960
that's all
anybody ever really wants.

1524
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,640
Mmm.

1525
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,120
To have an original idea...

1526
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,520
to fall in love.

1527
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,920
It takes courage...

1528
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,400
to surrender these things.

1529
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,600
Especially when you have
control issues.

1530
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,240
I get that a lot.

1531
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,680
(Sighs)

1532
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,320
I know what
they're going to talk about...

1533
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,920
when they talk about me.

1534
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,440
They're going to talk
about the mustache.

1535
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,360
People are so fucking petty.

1536
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,080
People say,
God, what's up with that?

1537
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,200
Like, didn't you know
that Chaplin had it first?

1538
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,960
Yeah! I knew, OK?

1539
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,840
(Sighs)

1540
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,360
It's either the name
of your first pet...

1541
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,320
and the first street
that you ever lived on...

1542
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,440
or it's your middle name...

1543
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,440
and the first street
that you lived on.

1544
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,200
Well. which is it?
I think--is it pet?

1545
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,400
-Pet.
-lt's pet.

1546
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,480
So. if it's pet...
all right.

1547
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,120
WOMAN: I'm Daisy Bufane.

1548
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,120
Daisy Bufane?

1549
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,640
Jo Jo Mountainview.

1550
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,960
(Laughter)

1551
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,120
I would be Peavey Meander.

1552
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,800
-What?
-Peavey Meander.

1553
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,160
Meander.

1554
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,600
-Thurston Craddock.
-Hmm.

1555
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,840
Uh, Baron Von Hugecock.

1556
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,840
(Laughter)

1557
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,880
What?
That's--that was my street.

1558
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,320
I lived on
Van Hugecock Avenue.

1559
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,760
(Laughter)

1560
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,240
MAN: The little kid
who lives on Van Hugecock.

1561
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,400
FRANCESCA:
Oh. God. where is Gus?

1562
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,440
-Save us from this misery.
-Uhh.

1563
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,920
CARL:
So. it's your middle name...

1564
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,360
-Right.
-first.

1565
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,960
CARL: And then--and then...

1566
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,200
the name of the street
that you grew up on.

1567
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,200
HEA THER: OK.

1568
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,040
(lnhales)

1569
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,280
Lolita...

1570
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,800
Honeysuckle.

1571
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
(Both laugh)

1572
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,880
(Line ringing)

1573
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,760
(People chattering)

1574
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,000
CALVIN:
All right. I'll open it.

1575
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,080
Obviously. everybody.
Gus is not here...

1576
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,880
so I was thinking...

1577
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,720
to pass the time,
why don't we all just kind of...

1578
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,160
whoever wants to, stand up
and give our little Gus stories.

1579
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,520
Uh, so, let me start off.

1580
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,840
I think
my favorite Gus moment...

1581
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,440
was when he called me
at 1:20 in the morning...

1582
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,480
to ask what
I really thought about him.

1583
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,360
WOMAN: What'd you say?

1584
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,360
What did I say?
What did I say?

1585
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,920
I said, Well, Gus,

whatever I think about you...

1586
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,920
l'm going to think the same
thing at 10:00 in the morning.

1587
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,720
Then I hung up.

1588
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,760
-Whatever.
-Calvin.

1589
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,160
Aw...

1590
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,640
It's all right. It's all right.

1591
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,920
Listen.
Iet's get down to business.

1592
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,960
If someone wants to stand up.
please. feel free.

1593
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,120
The floor is open.

1594
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,040
MAN. TAPPING GLASS:
All right. I got one. Calvin.

1595
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,640
Yes.
that's right. that's right.

1596
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,200
So. Gus and I--some of you
may not know this--

1597
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,880
Gus and I used
to hunt together. all right?

1598
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,560
And this one time, we're

waiting up in this deer stand...

1599
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:31,040
and, uh, Gus climbs down...

1600
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,680
to relieve himself
in the bushes, OK?

1601
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,840
(lnflating)

1602
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,560
And. uh--it gets funnier.
It gets funnier.

1603
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,080
So. uh...

1604
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,680
Wow. Thank you. man.

1605
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,480
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

1606
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,800
I really appreciate that,
you know?

1607
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,240
Especially coming
from someone like you...

1608
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:58,720
who writes and acts and directs
and plays the sax.

1609
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,800
Originally,
I kind of felt like...

1610
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,520
it was really coming after me,
you know?

1611
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,520
Now I feel like
l'm coming after it.

1612
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,720
Perfect.

1613
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,640
It's not coming after me.
I'm going to get it.

1614
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,560
-Can you grab that sword?
-l'm already on it, man.

1615
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,840
It's weird. I was watching
this interview with Al.

1616
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,040
-Pacino?
-Yeah.

1617
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,240
And he was talking
about the differences...

1618
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,080
between stage acting
and film acting...

1619
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,560
and he was talking about
how being on stage...

1620
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,840
is like being on this high wire,
like, a hundred feet up.

1621
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,000
And if you fall,
you're fucked...

1622
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,320
but acting in film is like
having the wire on the...

1623
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,480
-Ground.
-On the Ground.

1624
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,880
Oh, OK, you've heard that.

1625
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,080
Yeah, man, working for guys
like you and Carl...

1626
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,720
-the writing, just everything--
-Aw, come on, man.

1627
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,360
Where is Carl, by the way?
Is he...

1628
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,880
He had a party to go to.

1629
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,800
Oh, that's right.
Is that that producer guy?

1630
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,360
-Gus Delario.
-Oh, OK.

1631
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,360
That's not too shabby.
Carl owns a tux, huh?

1632
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,520
Mm-hmm.

1633
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,920
Huh. Not just one of those
shirts with the design on it?

1634
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,040
You know, he says
good luck and break a leg.

1635
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,960
Thank you. Thank you.

1636
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,400
Did I tell you about tomorrow?

1637
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,040
Yeah. Fuck, man.

Good luck, you know?

1638
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,000
That should go really good.
Ann? Is that her name?

1639
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,200
Yeah. It's a nice name.

1640
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,320
I hope so, man.
I've been looking a long time.

1641
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,560
Yeah. I hear you.
It's hard. I don't know.

1642
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,080
You want to go for a beer
or something?

1643
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,160
No, I got to teach a pilates
class, but thank you.

1644
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,480
FRANCESCA:
Shouldn't we all say grace?

1645
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,160
I think you're right.

1646
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,600
Listen, it's been 45 minutes,

and Gus is still not here...

1647
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,120
so let's eat.
Everybody dig in.

1648
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,600
MAN: Thank you.

1649
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,880
FRANCESCA:
Even at a party--bossy. bossy.

1650
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,080
CALVIN: You know you love it.
You love it. You know you do.

1651
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,080
(Low conversations)

1652
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,520
-Oh!
-Oh!

1653
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,160
FRANCESCA:
What are you doing? Shit.

1654
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,240
* C-C-C-Calvin *

1655
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,800

1656
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,640
CALVIN: Uh. everybody. this is
Lee Bright. Carl's wife.

1657
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,800

Hey, can you name all
the countries in Africa, Calvin?

1666
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,200
What do you want from me?

1667
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,880
-l'm not drunk.
-OK. Let's go.

1668
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,560
I'm just--
you know, fuck you, man.

1669
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,400
-Yeah, let's go.
-He needs to sober up.

1670
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,520
All right. Sorry.
Sit down. Sit down.

1671
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,120
He needs to fucking sober up.
I mean, come on.

1672
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,240
LlNDA:
You know what? Enough. No more.

1673
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,440
No more drinks, all right?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1674
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,520
No more. Do not drink anything.
Carl's on his way, all right?

1675
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,200
-Where are you going?
-l'll be right back.

1676
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,080
Don't drink
and don't talk to anybody.

1677
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,240
No one!

1678
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:40,360
Tch.

1679
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,600
Tch.

1680
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,520
(Knocking)

1681
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,520
Hey, Soledad. Do me a favor.

1682
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,720
-You're beautiful.
-Oh, thank you.

1683
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,560
-You working?
-No, l'm not.

1684
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,360
You know.
I left something in here today.

1685
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,240
Could you just let me in
for a second?

1686
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,080
Of course.

1687
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,280
Yeah. Thank you.

1688
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,640
Thanks. Gus?

1689
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,120
Hello?

1690
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,400
Hello?

1691
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,880
Oh, my God.

1692
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,640
Oh. my God.

1693
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:29,520
(Linda runs out)

1694
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,000
LEE: I mean. I'm wearing
a linen suit. for God's sake...

1695
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,720
and mascara's
running all over my face...

1696
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,200
(Cell phone rings)

1697
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,160
And I'm the only fucking car
in the parking lot.

1698
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,640
(Cell phone rings)

1699
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,600
It's...Iate...

1700
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,720
Hey, where did you go?

1701
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,560
Why?

1702
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,040
He's what?

1703
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,560
OK, OK, look, look, look,

we gotta call somebody, OK?

1704
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:58,920
We'll call down, and l'll say
I left something in here...

1705
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,520
We'll call down, and l'll say
I left something in here...

1706
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,360
and I came up and I knocked
and he didn't answer, OK?

1707
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,120
What? What?
Lee, I don't know what!

1708
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,280
-Just wait.
-Fuck!

1709
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,400
Wait for what? Oh, my God!

1710
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,720
A few hours ago he was alive,
OK? He was really alive!

1711
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,400
-Oh, man!

-Gus?

1712
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,400
-Fuck, fuck! Do not touch him!

-He's cold.

1713
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,040
-Jesus Christ!
-Oh, my God!

1714
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,520
Of course he's cold!

1715
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,000
CARL: I don't know
ifyou can calculate...

1716
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,240
I don't know
if you can quantify...

1717
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:30,160
the effect that would have
on a ten-year-old girl.

1718
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,160
I think Lee is like...

1719
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:37,480
Have you ever seen
a dog get hit by a car...

1720
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,440
but walk away?

1721
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:44,480
And... there's this impact...

1722
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,600
and you know
something terrible...

1723
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,720
has happened to that dog...

1724
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,960
but it walks away...

1725
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,040
and it doesn't seem to even
realize the implications...

1726
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,440
'cause it just goes on.

1727
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,320
But you know
that something terrible...

1728
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,320
has happened inside this dog.

1729
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,080
LEE:
Why do you think he did it?

1730
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:08,760
Oh, God, I don't know.

1731
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:14,160
It's some weird sex thing.
I don't know.

1732
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:17,120
LEE: No. Not this.

1733
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,160
Ohh.

1734
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,960
CARL: That's. I think.
what happened to Lee.

1735
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,720
It's like--it's like--

1736
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,280
She's a dog that got hit by
a car. and she walked away...

1737
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:33,640
and she's still walking. but...

1738
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,480
LINDA: I don't know.
I guess he was really sad.

1739
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,840
CARL: Some very. very
important things...

1740
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,600
inside her are damaged.

1741
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,880
LEE: Oh.

1742
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,920
Jesus.

1743
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,480
(Traffic noise)

1744
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:58,200
CARL: So... my wife and I
were having trouble...

1745
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,680
and I said I thought
maybe we were in a rut...

1746
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,760
and that maybe
we should try something...

1747
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,440
to liven things up.
and she said. Like what?

1748
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:13,360
And I said like maybe we should
tape ourselves doing it.

1749
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,480
And she was
completely shocked by this...

1750
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,080
and she thought
it was beyond disgusting...

1751
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,080
and that was that
for. Iike. four months.

1752
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,360
And then one night.
out of the blue...

1753
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,760
she says. Let's do it. 

1754
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,920
Ohh... (Laughs)

1755
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,640
So, we get it all set up, and
l'm ready and she's ready...

1756
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,000
and, uh, and she has gone out
and bought herself...

1757
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,160
a little toy to use
in the video.

1758
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,320
Really?

1759
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:50,280
Well, it's not a little toy.
It's a--it's a huge...

1760
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,840
(Giggling)

1761
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,880
Fucking...I mean, it was--

1762
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,160
No one has a--you know, OK.

1763
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,960
Well, anyway, I took one look
at this thing...

1764
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,240
and I knew
I would not be able to--

1765
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,400
(Laughs)

1766
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,880
I mean, it--I just couldn't--
I couldn't...

1767
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,440
I couldn't.

1768
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,720
So we haven't.

1769
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,080
And, you know...

1770
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:25,600
you can't come back
from something like that.

1771
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,280
I don't know whether
she lost respect for me...

1772
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,960
or I lost respect for myself,
but something was lost.

1773
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,240
HEATHER:
What are you going to do?

1774
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,840
CARL: I have no idea.

1775
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,680
I mean. I know professionally.
I'm gonna go back to teaching.

1776
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,080
I always loved teaching.

1777
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,240
-Really?
-Yeah.

1778
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,000
CARL: Never learned a thing in
my life. but I love teaching.

1779
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,920
The legacy of higher education.

1780
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,000
HEATHER: What about your wife?

1781
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,640
CARL: Tsk. I...

1782
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,080
will hope
that we get over this.

1783
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,440
HEATHER: Hmm.

1784
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,000
CARL: Aside from loving her.
I just really like her.

1785
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,520
A lot.

1786
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,400
But...

1787
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,080
I guess she thinks...

1788
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:25,240
everyone and everything
is against her.

1789
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,800
Somehow I just think...

1790
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,320
it keeps her from being happy.

1791
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,880
(lnhales)

1792
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,320
Is that your wife?

1793
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,240
-Hey!
-Hi.

1794
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,880
HEATHER: l'm with Dr. Green.

1795
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,440
CARL:
This is--Heather, this is Lee.

1796
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,440
-Django, he was sick.
-Django ate the brownies.

1797
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,080
-Yeah.
-He's OK.

1798
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,120
-He's fine now.
-We put him to bed.

1799
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,680
CARL: Are you OK?

1800
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,800
Um, the...

1801
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,960
they found Gus
in his hotel room.

1802
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,080
He's--he's dead.

1803
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,080
(Crying) He's--

1804
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,040
HEATHER: I should go.

1805
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,280
CARL: OK, OK. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you for that.

1806
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,720
HEATHER: Yeah.

1807
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,520
Hey...OK?

1808
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,960
(Sniffles)

1809
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,840
OK. OK.

1810
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,080
He--he's dead.

1811
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,760
Oh.

1812
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,680
Oh, sweetie pie. OK.

1813
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,680
Um...

1814
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,960
(Sobs)

1815
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,920
Well...

1816
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,160
If you ever left me,
I would die.

1817
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,480
I would die. Please don't.

1818
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,080
OK.

1819
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,640
(Kisses)

1820
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,840
(Sighs)

1821
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,640
I just want this day to be over.

1822
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,920
(Laughs)

1823
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,200
Mmm.

1824
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,240
(Sobs)

1825
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,640
Yeah. Let it out.

1826
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,080
OK.

1827
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,800
(Door closes)

1828
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:09,080
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

1829
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,480
CARL: Mmm.

1830
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,640
LEE: Hi.

1831
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,840
Did you have any
interesting dreams last night?

1832
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,080
CARL:
Um...no. Back to normal.

1833
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,960
LEE: Oh.

1834
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,320
CARL: I had an afro.

1835
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,920
LEE: Huh?

1836
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,800
LEE: I really don't know
what you should do...

1837
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,280
when you're in love
with someone.

1838
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,680
I know that you're thinking
about them all the time.

1839
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,520
You want to be with them
and see things with them.

1840
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,640
I think it's impossible.
It's an ideal to just think...

1841
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:52,960
that you can actually
be kind all the time...

1842
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,000
and never be disappointed
in them or by them.

1843
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,440
It's hard. I mean. it's like
the dream is short-lived.

1844
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:08,120
CARL: You've got
to keep hoping that...

1845
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,760
that there's more.

1846
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,320
FRANCESCA:
You know. you always--

1847
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,120
It's when
you least expect it...

1848
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,240
that something
kind of pops up. Iiterally.

1849
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,280
He just was--
appeared. kind of...

1850
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,320
Um. so...

1851
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,960
And nice that it's somebody...

1852
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,800
that I knew
a really long time ago.

1853
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,960
And. clearly. you know.
paid attention to me...

1854
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,000
before I was. you know. blond.

1855
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,040
(Laughs)

1856
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,360
So. that makes it nice...

1857
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,080
but I think
that it's just fate...

1858
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,320
and it's kind of. um...

1859
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,320
I don 't know. And today. just
negative ions in the air...

1860
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,280
bringing good fortune
and--and. yeah.

1861
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,440
Yeah.

1862
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,080
Sam Osborne.

1863
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,240
CAL VIN: I think.
you know. with Lucy...

1864
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,080
she's a good listener.
Iike I said...

1865
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:22,880
but she's also. you know.
she's teaching me stuff.

1866
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,560
She comes from a nice family.
Her parents are still together.

1867
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,000
She got three-four
brothers and sisters...

1868
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,560
and they're
a real close-knit family.

1869
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,320
It's just the opposite
of where I had come from.

1870
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:37,320
I don 't know. Honestly.
I don 't know what it is.

1871
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,200
I mean. I gotta just kinda go
off my gut right now...

1872
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,480
and just see what feels right.

1873
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,920
And right now.
when I'm with Lucy...

1874
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,640
man. it just feels right.

1875
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:46,720
(Piano playing)

1876
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,640
(Piano playing)

1877
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,680
(Sighs)

1878
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,920
(Footsteps)

1879
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,320
Catherine.

1880
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,120
Nicholas.

1881
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,360
You're here.

1882
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,040
I am.

1883
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,480
I wasn't sure.

1884
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,720
Neither was l--

1885
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,960
until now.

1886
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,280
Mmm.

1887
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,120
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

1888
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,400
(lce rattling)

1889
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,880
(Announcement on P.A.)

1890
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,600
(Soda hissing)

1891
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,200
-Did you get that?
-The announcement? No.

1892
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,560
-Where you going?
-Oh, Tucson.

1893
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,520
Mmm! I'm going to Tucson.

1894
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,720
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1895
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,200
-You ever been?
-No.

1896
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,040
It's supposed to be beautiful.

1897
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,320
That's what I hear.
I've never been, either.

1898
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,000
(lce rattling)

1899
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,920
-l'll see you on the plane.
-All right.

1900
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,600
-Oh, are you Russian?
-No.

1901
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,560
No. you're supposed to say.
Am I rushin' where?

1902
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,560
(Both laugh)

1903
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,640
-That's funny.
-Thanks.

1904
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,720
Hi. I'm sorry.
Is this seat taken?

1905
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,280
-No, no.

-Great.

1906
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,600
Ohh.

1907
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,760
Sorry.
I hope this isn't a full flight.

1908
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,760
-Yeah, I hope so, too.
-Sorry.

1909
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,080
LINDA:
You know. I was ready to go.

1910
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,440
I was at the airport.
and I met...

1911
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:31,240
Iike. in the food court.
I met this guy. um...

1912
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,680
and then he sat next to me
on the plane...

1913
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,680
and we just hit it off.

1914
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,640
His name's Arty. and we just...

1915
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,400
He just made me laugh.
He's really funny and sweet...

1916
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,360
and. um. sort of open.

1917
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,120
We just talked the whole time.
the whole flight.

1918
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,480
ARTY:.
She laughed in a way...

1919
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,720
that made me feel like
she saw me.

1920
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:58,920
I blew off
meeting--meeting Ann...

1921
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,480
but we ended up spending
the weekend together.

1922
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,400
And she's terrific.

1923
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,400
LINDA: It was amazing.
We just had an amazing time.

1924
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,480
It was definitely--

1925
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,480
It was like out of a movie.

1926
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,000
(Rock music playing)

1927
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,160

* Do something real *

1933
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:56,320

1952
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:35,200
This is, like,

the apex of the drama.

1953
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,480
When we know
who the killer is...

1954
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,560
I know.
The audience doesn't know yet.

1955
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,280
But I know.

1956
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,560
(Snaps fingers)

1957
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,120
And this is where you see me
put the pieces together.
