1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,550
Five minutes ago, the
entertainment program.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,720
So now if you're watching it, you're
already living in the past, right?

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,030
Let's meet tonight on entertainment.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,530
Five minutes ago, we asked the question,
whatever happened to Johnny Bravo?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,420
What kind of question is that?

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm Ryan here, a man live
in the gram from one.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,010
These man, I love Mac.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,020
It'll be socialite.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,810
I want to be, why did
they keep saying wannabe

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,170
to want to be TV hosts?

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,340
This was sobbing.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,800
The writers are trying to
say I'm hot in Japanese.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,030
Learn to read man.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,370
And tonight we answer who cares?

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,410
Bobby good-looking son, star of sparkle.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,550
Vampire in love.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:03,510
Jeez.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,310
James.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,670
Where's my deep fried peanut butter
sandwich, pizza burger, and my

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,200
deep fried milkshake to wash it.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,430
Now, did you see, they bumped my spot
for someone frequently over black.

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,290
What are they trying to say?

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,980
But all chicks dig a
skinny dudes with feelings.

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,480
All I know, it's not your fault
that my superstardom somehow

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,130
got sucked into a black hole.

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,440
What's up holler, whatnot days.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,270
When did Buffett pretty good way
to one and pay state parks for

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,160
the yellow, some due to the world.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,010
I even made that

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,880
dish tape that I posted on
the internet in Canada race.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,090
My little buddy, I got shot.

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,830
You don't have to watch that thing again.

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,700
And again,

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,100
after all the hotness
I've brought to the war.

35
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,289
You'd think the world would
want to give something back.

36
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,090
Hollywood is dead long.

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,979
Live Bali won.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,109
The Indian film industry is where it's
a place where stars are worshiped like

39
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:15,180
gods and the women are so gorgeous.

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,030
They make Hollywood actresses look like
something that a bugger with a hair in

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,800
Bollywood.

42
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,160
Huh?

43
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,600
Oh man.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,250
That's got Bravo written all over it.

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,950
Cause you know, they both begin
with a letter, James packer things.

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,240
We're going to go make us some
Indian movies and bandana.

47
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,910
Oh, the Indians are going to love.

48
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,625
I mean, you're writing.

49
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,780
A letter from Johnny, Johnny wrote
a whole letter using the alphabet.

50
00:04:56,609 --> 00:05:05,460
Dear mama, if you are reading, this
means that I'm dead spot, Johnny

Love Johnny.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,530
Did he say India?

55
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,740
I told Jesus a direct flight in 72 hours,
five stopovers, four different countries.

56
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,420
Oh, well I guess coach
class beads, air class.

57
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,900

excellent treat such gracefulness.

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,760
I am like the space.

59
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,719
Hulu flying lizard.

60
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Prepare for me to insert my bin
in your ear and make you my life.

61
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,250
Mamma.

62
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:33,599
The sky has the worst actor since, since
the guy from a real movie that is sick.

63
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,870
He is Bollywood's biggest star, bad guy.

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,969
That's my competition.

65
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,229
All this fame thing just got way too easy.

66
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,060
Johnny B M a house who loves me.

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,940
And I want answers Indiana.

83
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,010
Yeah, who's gonna stop

the possible permanent loss of your

00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:41,925
job.

96
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:50,235

When I leave your dead?

100
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:13,815
When I'm on the red carpet, who
should I see now for the 10th time?

101
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:19,485
I'm a self-indulgent mega who just
wants to be loved and adored from afar.

102
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,825
They had a real job, huh?

103
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:32,055
Wow.

104
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,785

00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,205
So I can be discovered as a Bollywood.

00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,130
Sure tongue, Missy, you talk to
your mama with hat and mouth.

Time is money.

We are losing light here.

117
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
Hot dog.

118
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,729
That's gotta be a genuine
Bollywood director and producer.

119
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,800
All I've got to do is get them
to see my face on in some star.

120
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,880
Now I've got this one

121
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,829
pops up coming through, namely me.

122
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,709
Beautiful.

00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:57,270
Thank you.

125
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:00,599
See, I am hot.

126
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:00,900
Aren't I.

127
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,090
Not sure Paul is going to steal
my short time to use my head.

128
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,020
Hey,

129
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,880
now what you need is
some of that last email.

130
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,640
Let's give it up for Johnny.

131
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I will clean up your mess

132
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,290
by the look of you.

133
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,710
You want something tired and boring?

134
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,490
Hold the talent.

135
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,670
Actually, I like to see the
specialist because I can't see

136
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,140
anything special in front of me.

137
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,210
Well, forget that I had
the soup of the day.

138
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,420
Nice and hot and banks.

139
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,439
You'll ask for it.

140
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,510
Missile fix has little red wagon.

141
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:03,630
I'll

142
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,590
tell you.

143
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,250
I keep getting this strange feeling.

144
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,610
Someone wants to do me a home nonsense who
would ever wish harm on such a handsome.

145
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,400
I got some temples on the question, huh?

146
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,630
You thought I was kidding.

147
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,010
You thought it was wrong?

148
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,320
I don't want to die early.

149
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,240
What I need is

150
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,470
to the eye, to the member.

151
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,150
G Y I can spend get your 10.

152
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,400
Let me see me on the street.

153
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,260
And they know, I mean, all I have to do is

154
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,230
the, baby's a bone.

155
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,370
They already know my name.

156
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:19,880
I'm not Bonnie.

157
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,560
So friendly quippy, whatever way you
greet me by this  is just look at my God.

158
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,370
I'm a mega minute.

159
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,250
sometimes I think jiggy
doesn't treat us with respect.

160
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,330
Sometimes.

161
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,700
I think Judy doesn't even like, yes.

162
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
Sometimes I wonder if my smile
is prettier than my hair.

163
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,790
Do you ever think about anything
besides, you know, my smile

164
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,050
and my hair equally pretty.

165
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:37,125
You really want to be a Bollywood
hunk and not jiggy off his

166
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,945
bed, but your Mendez, I do.

167
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,565
Here's the deal.

168
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:46,185
We give you the secret to jiggy
star power and help you achieve.

169
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:55,875
You will make me your agent
and she, but you do say that

170
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,255
two heads are better than one.

171
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:06,015
And this case I made one,
two more than two ladies.

172
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:07,845
You got yourself a deal.

173
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:09,585
So what's the big.

174
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,829
Wow,

175
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,770
how can he be?

176
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,600
He's reading my mind.

177
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:36,630
There is only one ticket, but you can
almost be like, you can,  two points.

178
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,680
If there's one of the, we
had a house to have them

179
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,520
rip off.

180
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,350
So when you say rip off is not a
good thing, cause it sounds like.

181
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,380
It has lost all its palette.

182
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
His own youth had doubt that he
uses so much of the original gunky

183
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,260
buys to gain power over his band.

184
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,530
Your made here resales,
his used hair down.

185
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,609
Wow.

186
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,420
If you want to be a doer, you've
got to get the fresh stuff.

187
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,410
Wait a sec.

188
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,869
If it's so secret, how
come you to know about it?

189
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,740
Because we weren't just
Diggies number one, fans.

190
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:31,815
I need it.

191
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:37,275
I pick fast do that.

192
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:40,305
Dan Dan's

193
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,475
creepy.

194
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:54,735
I must just, you too,

195
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:04,575
man.

196
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,975
You need to man up or a monkey.

197
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,670
Just stop it, man.

198
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,020
Okay.

199
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,190
Who's going to knock

200
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,960
how talented I am now.

201
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,920
Step aside,

202
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,950
Johnny Bravo.

203
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:00,254
He knows your name represent

204
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,745
like what you've done to the
place must be a real magnet

205
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:17,475
for the late heirs, but crazy

206
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:21,284
Johnny.

207
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,774
I see that you

208
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:28,935
can, we just cut to the chase?

209
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,220
You'll have a secret magical hair gel.

210
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,870
That will give me extra hotness.

211
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,580
I do.

212
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,960
But first I must show you the
process by which it is made.

213
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,650
Okay.

214
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,060
Y just make it quick, but women of
Bollywood have waited long enough.

215
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,530
Hi, I start with the sweat
extracted from the users of

216
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:54,980
infomercial weight loss machines,
then the tears of a teenage girl.

217
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,080
Who's woken up with a seat on the night.

218
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,790
And finally, I infuse it with a
stolen size of love, long celebrity

219
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,680
worshipers, Jean dreamboat, Bobby
good-looking son in sparkle.

220
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,270
Vampire in love.

221
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,310
Let's stay up all night
talking about the feelings.

222
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,560
I love loving you.

223
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,330
My lovely law.

224
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,170
Oh, the very distillation of
heartbreak and desperation mixed

225
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,580
with  vanity now with horrible.

226
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,149
I'll take it, my guy, my
store, God, just get the stuff.

227
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:51,100
I don't want to pretend like I'm
listening anymore on your own head.

228
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,520
Yeah.

229
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,290
A hair gel only got it.

230
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,379
How much do I owe?

231
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,470
Just one is for free, but
the rest will cost you.

232
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,840
really, it's free except for
the part about your soul.

233
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,990
So then it's like a trade where I
don't have to pay you any money.

234
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:11,800
Basically.

235
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,840
If you don't put any monetary
value on your soul, then

236
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,040
sure you can call it a trade.

237
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,260
I was a sucker for a bargain

238
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,060
that's so magic hair.

239
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,680
This is too much cool.

240
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,300
The waste on some old river nude.

241
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:48,945
What are you playing
super fly or super cool.

242
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:52,995
You decide it's okay.

243
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,815
I guess what you're done with your hands.

244
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,005
Listen, I can stand around all day.

245
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,025
Fantastic.

246
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,035
But I've got to move
around and look fantastic.

247
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:04,965
But I will give you the honor
of watching me walk away.

248
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,565
all this love for Johnny
and not one chicken, a cry.

249
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:56,115
I want my mind, like for free.

250
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:57,675
I want my muffin back.

251
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:58,415
Sorry.

252
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,345
No refunds or exchanges.

253
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,875
I've been, what am I supposed to do?

254
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,875
I don't know all the way.

255
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:07,435
Dabo the dose,

256
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:11,665
Y X giant head.

257
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:14,005
You make a lot of sense,
even if you are freaking

258
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:24,115
my hair.

259
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:24,835
So amazing.

260
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:29,905
I want to die and come back
as my own Cudi picture.

261
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:34,375
It Jiechi is an Indian robot from
the future who travels back in time

262
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:36,355
and falls in love with a motorcycle.

263
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,635
He is the Terminator.

264
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:41,265
I am liking it.

265
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:45,315
I'm liking it is going on.

266
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:01,205
good.

267
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:03,465
It's true.

268
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,095
excuse me.

269
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,775
The exquisite creature blessed
with deceling follicles speak.

270
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:25,035
we haven't gone to the fuse.

271
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,129
And you could crush it by hundreds of
millions of artists living a balance of

272
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:34,219
a thousand rooms on the most luxurious.

273
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,770
You have me at worship by
hundreds of millions of

274
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,979
I'm sure he'll come back.

275
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:56,340
He's probably just telling them
where they can take a flying.

276
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,450
this is it.

277
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,060
Johnny come to Bali.

278
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,890
Karen, it must be a pretty
lax around his parks.

279
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,440
Sienna's house, able to smuggle two guns

280
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,630
to permit a kick out of

281
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,940
Who is this prancing
pony and relaxed jiggy.

282
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,210
Some nobody will pull off
the street to be Acosta.

283
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,340
No, I only work with
actors, but five agree.

284
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,050
Other than me it's in my contract.

285
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,179
He is about me or I can.

286
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,260
And what does I can do?

287
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,760
You do?

288
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,370
It's because of the eyeballs and
attracts ands to bite the eyeballs

289
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:58,740
and then the people who can no
longer see the, I can be precise.

290
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,379
alright, let's go for the hustle.

291
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:21,225
Where is my friends call me Johnny,
but you can call me handsome

292
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:26,054
when I can read subtitles.

293
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:27,584
So I'll try not to speak too fast.

294
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:29,685
Mr.

295
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:30,284
Bravo.

296
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:37,635
Hey Johnny to the lady with talented
lips, really about Bollywood.

297
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:43,784
Johnny, why are you looking to get
me a little lesson, but why do it in

298
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:46,395
private when we can do it in public?

299
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,709
You've seen the films outside
this place has show the world

300
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,070
of songs and fancy clothes.

301
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,480
They deal with doom and fear
because that's not what we're about.

302
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:08,520
Put out about.

303
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:11,335
And what attitude, that's why we want the

304
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,324
As long as you know,

305
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,564
when you're saying that
part about the free food.

306
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:14,794
Again, I'm starving.

307
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:32,835
Devil of a man.

308
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:33,105
You

309
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:46,915
talk to my agent, talk to
my manager, your manager.

310
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,840
Remind me why I need you again and
friends, keep your feet on the ground

311
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,850
because you're about to go big time.

312
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,940
You're about to surround
yourself with shocks and weasels.

313
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:10,110
But most of all, because we had a deal.

314
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,899
Johnny, we give you the
secret to jiggy stop.

315
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:17,879
You'll give us 50% of your earnings
while you did introduce me.

316
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,315
Give me a better offer.

317
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:31,065
Gotcha.

318
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,175
I thought it was some
kind of weird Indiana

319
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,185
bat show business.

320
00:29:55,304 --> 00:30:00,855
this is your last chance to
kill the da is irritating.

321
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:06,044
My Botox, and I need to, so you
are now to be getting our new pod.

322
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:15,345
No way, Sunday, this map, it looks

323
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:20,295
like you just saw a hot pumpkin

324
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:27,405
rookie

325
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:32,625
struggling by nature.

326
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:38,355
You wouldn't know steadily fist and didn't

327
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:44,565
didn't kiss.

328
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:45,135
Right?

329
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:54,195
Jiggy Watson.

330
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,820
What's the matter.

331
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,280
Gigli not enough kissing
for you or what was that?

332
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,390
Non kissing?

333
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,550
Jiggy cricket stays in the picture.

334
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,960
Johnny baby did the big bag.

335
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,400
Mega start upset.

336
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,820
I can see what's happening here,

337
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,980
but it's time for everyone to get

338
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,210
right here in the side of the neck
with my school, bring straight.

339
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,580
Really.

340
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,100
I would have gone for something
a little dead year, a gun or

341
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,290
something, maybe a ball as you will.

342
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,430
Not my mother.

343
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,620
Anyway enough about me.

344
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,450
Let's talk about myself and I,

345
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,110
oh,

346
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,870
this is Johnny brules.

347
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,980
Heron gets away with it.

348
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,420
No.

349
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:35,685
is distracted, but only because I want to,

350
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:49,635
sorry, man.

351
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,405
Sometimes beauty is a beast.

352
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,425
Don't take it too bad.

353
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:02,475
The better man won, not to
mention the cuter cooler.

354
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,909
This is Robin

355
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,330
He does not clumsy medical mouse.

356
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,690
He's charging all the place
in an effort to upstate jiggy.

357
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,610
Battery must make short Chicky,
so his charging will stop.

358
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,170
But then what are Donnie Bravo?

359
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,670
Charlie Bravo.

360
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,650
Sorry.

361
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,760
Terrible.

362
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,130
It's either me.

363
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,370
He is the one above the contract is not
worth the paper it's is written off.

364
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,500
I have it on paper.

365
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:57,435
No less

366
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:10,634
G is in that movie.

367
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:15,255
We shot it's almost finished.

368
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:23,565
The hottest lights are in Bollywood is

369
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:37,384
Pardon me?

370
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:37,435
The

371
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:43,755
God, Indiana Jones.

372
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:47,384
You're telling me you
might not given McGee.

373
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,800
dreams at working in one of the
great restaurants of Europe.

374
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,310
People wants to see a filthy rat,
put its dirty balls on human food.

375
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,330
It never sell.

376
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,970
I don't want you.

377
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:33,525
I think we need a new arena.

378
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:47,595
I laughed out loud, not a comedy.

379
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,740
It should be on a
Bollywood soundstage with

380
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:03,630
client.

381
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:08,220
Yeah, I see ugly monkey is an
ugly crew, but no super is ready

382
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,730
to worship at Johnny's feet
unless the hotties are inside.

383
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,690
cost money.

384
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,920
It's much cheaper to destroy
a real monkey palace that set.

385
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:37,855
Oh, I see.

386
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:42,775
Then you've got a contract to prove
that Johnny was sealed at the handshake.

387
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:53,935
little girls with no business experience.

388
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:55,525
Be so naive.

389
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:56,905
Now get out of here.

390
00:37:56,965 --> 00:37:57,445
Not you.

391
00:37:57,535 --> 00:37:58,195
I like your face.

392
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:00,265
You don't have an agent, do you?

393
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:02,155
No.

394
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:03,905
Good.

395
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:18,715
Oh, we've got 28 pages of script to
get through and 40 minutes to do it.

396
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:21,415
So just make us, we've got plenty of time.

397
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:23,245
I don't want anyone slacking.

398
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:28,165
No, one's told John.

399
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:28,765
I want to do.

400
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,395
What's the name of this movie,

401
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:47,325
logic originality on the schedule again,
Indiana Jones and the last crystal had

402
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,035
born of the dome golden monkey temple.

403
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:03,745
we must tidy.

404
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,565
If we do not treat the last
crystal head bone of the doom

405
00:39:06,565 --> 00:39:08,395
golden monkey template, the world

406
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:14,515
monkey.

407
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:16,495
Boy, I hate those guys.

408
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,595
Jealously guarding the treasure.

409
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:42,385
because I am admiring the smoothness of
my jaw and the closest shave ever that

410
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:44,305
you can now get from G shaving gel.

411
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,755
So smooth in men.

412
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:31,305
my brother.

413
00:40:31,785 --> 00:40:32,535
Take it out.

414
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:48,555
whatever you do by my cakes,
don't look at the awesomeness.

415
00:40:58,965 --> 00:40:59,385
All right.

416
00:40:59,385 --> 00:40:59,655
Sugar.

417
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,705
You can open those papers,

418
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:05,055
Indiana.

419
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,540
chief, Indiana.

420
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,380
We have reliable Intel that
Archduke Ferdinand of Australia

421
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,730
is about to be assassinated.

422
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,610
Sorry, I'm losing you fucking Indiana.

423
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,630
what do you want to do in my

424
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:46,200
what's up with the audience.

425
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:49,919
You think I just mocked their smarts
and culture or something like that.

426
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:54,720
You getting about trashing
the place answer, right.

427
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:55,980
And thank goodness.

428
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,740
Nothing says box office more
than a box office burned to the

429
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,700
ground, the cons, what do they say?

430
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:08,819
Two kids can be here to Sharon.

431
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:09,390
My moment.

432
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:10,890
Where are they?

433
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,819
Anyway, I just move.

434
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:13,080
He's not suitable for children.

435
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:14,939
Our children burned in the fire escape.

436
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:17,819
The thing is.

437
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,070
You know what all this fires
making me hungry for some barbecue.

438
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:29,990
What are you saying?

439
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,130
We go get us some of
that free Bollywood food.

440
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,410
Johnny.

441
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,240
Big time now to go with your new
status as Bollywood royalty, you must

442
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,310
have your absurdly lavish palace.

443
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,680
Whoa.

444
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,870
Oh yes.

445
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,300
There's room for many chips and goats.

446
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,070
And it's mine.

447
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:55,440
You say no strings attached all
yours, but this is one little thing.

448
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,820
It's embarrassing for
a proud man, but, uh,

449
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,080
could I have your autograph?

450
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,030
No problem.

451
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,200
That's not an autograph book.

452
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,660
That's a contract.

453
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,630
It's a standard agreement
and it's written in block.

454
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,920
Yes.

455
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,660
There is a funny story about that.

456
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:25,830
I was shaving at my desk and I watched
this part of a dipole deleted, sorry, man.

457
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,560
As much as my good business central
is telling me that you're an honest

458
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,180
man, I've already made a deal.

459
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:34,320
Stinky and Milky.

460
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,660
I thought it was funky and
monkey, whatever they are.

461
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,310
They're like family to me.

462
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,330
can family get your best
seats in the best restaurants?

463
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,390
The fast cars, the fast
books, the fast turtles at the

464
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,890
annual Bollywood turtle races.

465
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,200
Can family make your dreams
come true for failure?

466
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,660
No family will just destroy you like
jackals, but if you want to choose

467
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,340
jackals over your dreams, I understand

468
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,300
anything else.

469
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,250
You want me to sign this?

470
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:12,615
Welcome to the dream
factory, Johnny Bravo.

471
00:44:12,675 --> 00:44:13,785
Now get some rest.

472
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:15,945
We start shooting your
next hit in an hour.

473
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:16,845
Opposite.

474
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:19,785
Our two it's set under water predictably.

475
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:21,555
Bring vinegar marked with a seat.

476
00:44:21,585 --> 00:44:21,975
Nice.

477
00:44:22,335 --> 00:44:22,515
Hmm.

478
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:25,335
I didn't tell my greens involving C lies.

479
00:44:29,115 --> 00:44:29,775
Mama.

480
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:46,545
I'd say hi, but legally I'm not allowed
to I'm relentless business executives.

481
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:49,335
We got you from my true friends.

482
00:44:49,335 --> 00:44:52,395
Just gave me a swinging
bachelor pad and a car.

483
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:58,245
There's something you need to know.

484
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:00,345
We believe you're in danger from the

485
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:05,445
Why don't you girls run off home.

486
00:45:05,805 --> 00:45:08,265
I drive you there in my new
sports car, but it seems to be

487
00:45:08,265 --> 00:45:10,035
painted onto my new fake garage.

488
00:45:12,225 --> 00:45:13,095
Sorry, kids.

489
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:16,035
I got to go get accustomed
to my new life of luxury.

490
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:30,765
Ah, man, not as one big trainer
for one big Bollywood star.

491
00:45:41,654 --> 00:45:49,335
There's no place like
fake home water, high GMC.

492
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:56,835
You want to cross your fingers
and make good to your mama.

493
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:01,935
Mama.

494
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:06,615
Mama, who are you expecting?

495
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,325
A Bollywood babe.

496
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:09,765
Wrapped up in a bow.

497
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:17,025
Hi Johnny.

498
00:46:18,515 --> 00:46:18,825
Sue me.

499
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:19,634
You're going to scram.

500
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:20,415
I got mama.

501
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:20,985
Your shoes.

502
00:46:23,085 --> 00:46:23,475
Mamma.

503
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:25,755
What are you doing in Indiana man?

504
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:30,735
Without a cowboy hat, I came to
look after your affairs, like

505
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,925
manage your brand new friends site.

506
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:37,665
Then Johnny Bravo, photo
blog, something looks off.

507
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:38,925
That's an old.

508
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:42,135
From before you were useful and famous.

509
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:43,215
Now come on son.

510
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:52,455
Tell mama about your Bollywood career
stable as this Hare house finally found

511
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:54,645
somewhere that appreciates Hey for me.

512
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,595
So I go on more.

513
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:01,665
All your dreams are coming true, boy,

514
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:12,645
I think you mean bottom of the well

515
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,635
man who knew Bollywood Hawks
were supposed to hear a car

516
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,340
you guys are right.

517
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,690
Seriously though.

518
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,590
I'd like to thank you for renaming your
national movie awards, the brothers,

519
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:37,930
and for awarding them all to me.

520
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,620
But I guess what I have most to be
thankful for is those fucking assassins.

521
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,500
Haven't tried to get me for some
time, unless of course, they've just

522
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,580
been waiting to take me down and some
fancy schmancy award show, but man,

523
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,410
that'd be a scarier than a weirdo.

524
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,980
Plus you people paying money to see
it, the movies, I mean talk about,

525
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,130
only at 10,000 rupees a pop
gone into a store and here, you

526
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,029
know, it's amazing how things
just keep going my way,

527
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,160
my head to be taken out least
it was my, someone has produced.

528
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:35,895
Oh, Johnny, don't say that.

529
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:37,515
You'll be okay.

530
00:51:37,605 --> 00:51:42,465
You will a little bit thinner in
some weird places, but, but okay.

531
00:51:42,705 --> 00:51:43,215
Oh mama.

532
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:44,775
It's my time.

533
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:47,745
I really was too beautiful for this world.

534
00:51:53,295 --> 00:51:56,655
I'll I'll always love me too.

535
00:51:58,735 --> 00:51:59,985
I hope y'all caught that on camera.

536
00:52:00,015 --> 00:52:00,375
Cause I will.

537
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:01,695
Some of my finest work yet.

538
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,729
ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Bravo.

539
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,950
Bollywood's greatest action.

540
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:20,339
Star is now an inaction stop
permanently Memphis shall any style in

541
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:22,979
the Bollywood sky shine as brightly.

542
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,529
Hello, friends, Indians
come lend me your ear.

543
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,979
I can't love to praise
Johnny Bravo, but to.

544
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:38,605
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new
star, greatest star in Indian sky.

545
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,595
Well, you'll take a Bible boy.

546
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:58,465
And I moved on because it looked
like he was still breathing.

547
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:01,375
I fully assure you that Johnny
has passed on to the great white

548
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:04,735
wave and you receive a farewell,
but fitting a star of his talents.

549
00:53:15,955 --> 00:53:16,165
Yeah.

550
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:20,965
Something is very suspicious
about all of this smell around.

551
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:31,290
Well, I don't know how things work
in your country, but when there's an

552
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:37,950
unexplained mystery and the USA only
play on qualified folks, you obviously

553
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,410
tried us all that are y'all with me.

554
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:48,120
Now, everything I see on TV is true
with this much sass, moodiness and

555
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:54,900
token I candy, then we'll have this
mystery solved next time or not

556
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:08,260
sketch house cats, no nibbling on
this haka, cheesecake on a Bomani

557
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,810
Bonnie Potter hair out of place.

558
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,230
I thought I was a garner warning.

559
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,190
Excessive use may result in the
production of super hairs, able to

560
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:22,650
withstand pressures up to, but not
exceeding a giant golden statue may

561
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,750
also cause spontaneous shrinkage of.

562
00:54:40,455 --> 00:54:41,415
Sorry at Tiffin Watson.

563
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:43,935
I'm not treatment to a hungry
from mega some malaria.

564
00:54:48,345 --> 00:54:49,305
don't you recognize?

565
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:55,185
Sorry, man.

566
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:57,615
Couldn't see it through
all the humiliation.

567
00:54:58,455 --> 00:54:59,325
What are you implying?

568
00:54:59,535 --> 00:54:59,685
Then?

569
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:02,835
I was hired under the only employment
graft available to me was to become a

570
00:55:14,355 --> 00:55:15,345
fall from grace.

571
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:18,765
I've had no choice, but to become
one of the lowly people whose

572
00:55:18,765 --> 00:55:20,205
wives have made me a millionaire.

573
00:55:23,595 --> 00:55:27,075
Hey man being awesome and Indiana
and all it's cracked up to be.

574
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,765
It makes no one to try to get rid
of you like some mega superstars.

575
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:31,245
I know.

576
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:34,125
What do you mean some crazy assassins?

577
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,855
Always trying to knock me
off strangulation here.

578
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:40,694
Sort of pack their giant golden statue
of yourself, tied to your pants on a

579
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:43,725
national award ceremony, long story.

580
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:44,805
But you're talking about that.

581
00:55:45,495 --> 00:55:47,355
Why would tongues want to get rid of you?

582
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,575
I was the pivot target that me.

583
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:51,855
What can I say?

584
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,105
Maybe these thugs are like dogs to trees.

585
00:55:54,105 --> 00:55:57,225
They come and go see,

586
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,615
oh, whoever is paying maybe on a GI homes.

587
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:05,265
Dave want them to disappear?

588
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:10,245
First things first, you need
to take a shower second.

589
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,305
I know what you're thinking,
but my looks are so razor sharp.

590
00:56:13,305 --> 00:56:18,495
You need chain mail on your eyeballs
just to look at me, which means that

591
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:22,004
it's time that you wouldn't make the
second and first biggest Bollywood

592
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:26,475
stars of all time, respectively
team up to bring down the bad guy.

593
00:56:34,305 --> 00:56:39,765
they never sleep know this was a
cool graphic and all, but you really

594
00:56:39,765 --> 00:56:40,964
need to back up and take a salad.

595
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:10,965
Oh, mama.

596
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:11,835
That's poor.

597
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:12,825
Jamesy down there.

598
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:18,975
He is next in line to be knocked off
the monthly, uh, Johnny, are you sure

599
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:20,745
these disguises are going to work?

600
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:22,845
Are you kidding?

601
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:26,025
Who would expect a couple of actors to
be dressing up as someone in their mind?

602
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:31,995
You must think we are fools.

603
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,895
We'll let the couple of beautiful
ladies, like you escape our attention.

604
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:40,410
To the office.

605
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,690
We are just about to drink a toast.

606
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,750
It ends up Jimmy and Johnny, bro.

607
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,360
This is why you are single with the Oz.

608
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:56,100
What did my friend mentor say is
a dose to the discovery of June

609
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,990
you beautiful Bollywood bay.

610
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,920
the broad shorter one.

611
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,090
Look strangely familiar.

612
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:21,660
All right.

613
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,100
This is the final feeds of strangers.

614
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,570
Then you will do the dancing.

615
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,020
Yes.

616
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,340
I'm way more wool, man.

617
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,060
Let a new

618
00:58:39,435 --> 00:58:43,515
I knew it that's no woman, Johnny Bravo.

619
00:58:45,885 --> 00:58:48,105
How did you see it through my disguise?

620
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:48,825
I didn't.

621
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:53,535
I simply recall seeing an audition tape
many years ago with a similar looking

622
00:58:53,535 --> 00:59:00,155
abroad shoulder woman in it, one slaughter
that very, you even gave to keep a copy.

623
00:59:01,635 --> 00:59:04,785
The audition tape that you posted
on the internet and content

624
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:07,875
is also known as the genie

625
00:59:11,055 --> 00:59:12,405
Jeeves mop this part.

626
00:59:13,905 --> 00:59:15,015
You're going to edit that out, right?

627
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:33,765
Mr DeMille too close, man, too close

628
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:43,575
with, I mean, Janie old female
actress furniture removing

629
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:45,795
this girl, don't call me.

630
00:59:45,884 --> 00:59:46,725
I'll call you.

631
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:53,535
Y you've never done anything embarrassing
to make a buck, not like that.

632
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:54,884
Yeah.

633
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:55,305
Whatever.

634
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:59,295
What's up with you on the fucks,
trying to put me in Giglio, may I

635
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:09,705
by for the only reason that is
you fool money, you see our plan

636
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:13,995
was to make a bandana giant horns
famous for being gritty's last film.

637
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:18,615
It's a well-known fact that no matter
how much money a working celebrity brings

638
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,515
in it, doesn't compare to the publicity
value of a well time sudden, Richard.

639
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,350
Zoe hired a pug gut.

640
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,370
What had been agreed by one of
Gigi's many feet in advertisement.

641
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:31,770
breeze.

642
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:39,930
That's the way to go hogs for frogs, kinda
like you'll want to criticize genie until

643
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:45,509
Johnny Bravo came along and shown like a
supernova compared to jiggy dwarf star.

644
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:53,580
And so we decided to make you a
mega star, much obliged and the new

645
01:00:53,580 --> 01:01:00,180
victim of our plat muscle Frankie
on that one, doc, we have heard

646
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,799
all we need to hear come Johnny.

647
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,120
We must notify the police.

648
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,600
Um, may I use your phone?

649
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,759
I don't have a lot of
minutes left on my phone.

650
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,470
I think not besides your fours are
just wasting time tugs to Monday and an

651
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,240
extra special payment for this services.

652
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,620
I sacrifice.

653
01:01:18,495 --> 01:01:18,675
Ah,

654
01:01:22,455 --> 01:01:26,445
10 people, you know, oh, for heaven sake.

655
01:01:26,445 --> 01:01:27,615
It's pinky chinky, Sumi, and

656
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,859
Mine was bigger time for the
Bravo jiggy ball special.

657
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,899
What is the.

658
01:01:53,825 --> 01:01:57,384
Again, I take it.

659
01:01:57,404 --> 01:01:59,194
You know where the secret thug temple is?

660
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:01,475
No, but I think we both know one person

661
01:02:12,335 --> 01:02:15,725
So you seek the secret thug tempo.

662
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:22,265
Well then how much wood, wood,
wood, Chuck, Chuck, if a woodchuck

663
01:02:22,265 --> 01:02:27,274
could Chuck Lorre sounds about right
then what's the way to the secret.

664
01:02:27,274 --> 01:02:27,875
Fuck temple.

665
01:02:35,105 --> 01:02:35,464
Gotcha.

666
01:02:40,714 --> 01:02:42,964
Special batch of my most powerful agent.

667
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:46,355
If you get in real trouble, use your head.

668
01:02:48,484 --> 01:02:49,625
But why do you help us?

669
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:53,615
Because sometimes not
just songs need hugs.

670
01:02:56,615 --> 01:02:57,754
and we were after directions.

671
01:02:57,754 --> 01:02:58,024
Okay.

672
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:58,745
And not therapy.

673
01:02:58,774 --> 01:02:59,705
Go, go, go, go.

674
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:10,714
So normally,

675
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:18,575
mostly halfway through him telling me how
I saw myself, reflected them with bike

676
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:20,524
mirror, and couldn't take my eyes off me.

677
01:03:21,095 --> 01:03:22,654
Hey, look where I am again.

678
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:27,685
Stop man.

679
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:29,015
Why'd it.

680
01:03:29,045 --> 01:03:30,775
Half a beer stuff, man.

681
01:03:43,825 --> 01:03:45,265
I think we lost him now.

682
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:45,775
Where was I?

683
01:03:47,005 --> 01:03:47,995
We are here.

684
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,795
We can admire out of beauty Laden.

685
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,255
You saved the day I called the police.

686
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:01,975
That dude is starting to give me,

687
01:04:17,905 --> 01:04:21,625
take these sacrifices until
you all to ensure prosperity.

688
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:22,585
If we all follow us.

689
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:24,745
And also as a bit of a log,

690
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:38,125
this monkey lover ha.

691
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,740
That doesn't make any sense.

692
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,960
Do you even know what a lock

693
01:04:46,109 --> 01:04:47,129
he needs it's time to get?

694
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,089
What does that even mean?

695
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:54,509
Kind of similar and please
dispose of these fools.

696
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:35,955
Can I get a gold dine?

697
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,185
Good Johnny.

698
01:05:37,395 --> 01:05:38,175
Good Johnny.

699
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:44,475
Now, can I have a good may
it's more Johnny, not so fast.

700
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:51,015
Bravo, more John got them.

701
01:06:03,615 --> 01:06:07,155
person stay like this, you
know, you're kind of cute.

702
01:06:08,705 --> 01:06:13,415
Shame about my hair, Tony.

703
01:06:13,715 --> 01:06:15,005
Excuse me, miss Johnny.

704
01:06:17,345 --> 01:06:21,095
If you get in real
trouble, use your heads,

705
01:06:28,265 --> 01:06:28,715
man.

706
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,115
Just when I thought you
couldn't get any weirder,

707
01:06:50,225 --> 01:06:51,485
pure awesomeness.

708
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:52,415
Impossible.

709
01:06:54,245 --> 01:06:54,995
It cannot be

710
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,319
We give out

711
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:13,850
I've seen enough cartoons to know that
the only thing left to do is on mass.

712
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:15,080
The big, bad guy.

713
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:29,945
It's the danger from the monkey palace.

714
01:07:36,305 --> 01:07:36,905
Hey Amy.

715
01:07:37,925 --> 01:07:40,865
You know, upgrades don't
work as bad as I thought

716
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,955
monkeys uncle's mother.

717
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,175
Yes, it was me.

718
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:56,585
You'll see, it's been my lifelong dream
to show all little aspiring monkey  that

719
01:07:56,585 --> 01:07:59,525
it is possible to achieve all your dreams.

720
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:04,055
No matter how big  I hear you.

721
01:08:04,055 --> 01:08:06,485
Lucky boy, and a failure monkey pain.

722
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:09,995
How long snow monkey they'd want
it to be nothing more than a planet

723
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:17,015
Butler, but he was kept down by the man
handsome man, handsome hair, handsome.

724
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:22,940
Uh, I believe I was in the middle
of my melodramatic expositional.

725
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,290
Well, whatever, just wrap it up.

726
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,150
This movie ain't called J hold Jeeves.

727
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,160
Don't you want me to explain how?

728
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,840
Nah, let me just skip to the whole
and I would've gotten away with it a

729
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:39,360
bit and I would have gotten away with
it if it wasn't for those meddling.

730
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:40,850
Yeah.

731
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:41,250
Yeah.

732
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,980
We all know how the rest goes, man.

733
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:48,240
You all, supervillains just sit
around watching Scooby-Doo myeloma.

734
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,300
You probably get distorted.

735
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:56,970
Sure.

736
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,980
Johnny Bravo does anything for his fan.

737
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:06,720
Not Johnny Bravo, no
genie over at the station.

738
01:09:12,095 --> 01:09:13,234
Can you ever forget?

739
01:09:14,165 --> 01:09:16,144
Well, you can start by making me a

740
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:21,875
80%.

741
01:09:22,745 --> 01:09:28,774
Let's say 1445, the best
little stalkers who became

742
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:30,154
ten-year-old agents, who I fired.

743
01:09:30,154 --> 01:09:31,144
I ever met in my life.

744
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:32,404
Come on, Johnny.

745
01:09:32,404 --> 01:09:34,234
Let's blow this pop stand.

746
01:09:34,265 --> 01:09:42,725
We'll go home, honey, Ron, and say goodbye
now, 80% just came to give you a goodbye.

747
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:45,845
Present, looking at me
while I say goodbye.

748
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:50,104
My God.

749
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:50,585
Just slipping.

750
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:57,095
You know, there's no shame in being the
second best looking man in Bollywood.

751
01:09:57,855 --> 01:09:58,925
I have accepted that.

752
01:09:58,925 --> 01:09:59,765
My friend,

753
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,975
Johnny, Johnny,

754
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:16,235
keep it kid.

755
01:10:17,075 --> 01:10:20,195
I realized something today,
the power of pure awesome.

756
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:22,475
This isn't than any hair gel it's in me.

757
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:23,945
It always one.

758
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,220
It really was in the hedge.

759
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,770
And give me a couple of thousand
