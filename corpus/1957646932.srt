1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,605
(subdued music)

2
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,416
(tense music)

3
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,738
- [Man On Radio]
 Good morning, folks.

4
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:48,376
This is KFR Radio, the voice
 of Fredricksville Arizona,

5
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:52,380
broadcasting at 650
 megahertz on your AM dial.

6
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,249
Our new 3,000-watt
 transmitter now allows me

7
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,018
to give a rainy-day hello
 to our closest neighbors

8
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,554
in Wachesaw, 200 miles north.

9
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,591
And a howdy-do to the residents
of the Lower Mill Valley,

10
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,427
170 miles to the southeast.

11
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,095
Hey, it looks like some sunshine

12
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,930
is peeking through
 the cloud cover.

13
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,199
Well, there it is.

14
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,601
It just might be a
 sunny day, after all.

15
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:18,206
* Must've taken the
 wrong winding road *

16
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:23,211
* 'Cause there's a Sycamore tree
where the engine used to be *

17
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:28,882
* God's poetic
 justice, I suppose *

18
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:33,787
* What once was the
 envy of the showroom *

19
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:38,125
* Is now covered
 with ivy and crust *

20
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,861
- [Man] Gemini to Mars.

21
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,197
Pony Express is on the move.

22
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,200
- Mars here.

23
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,601
Message received.

24
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,741
- [Woman] Alerting strike force.

25
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,575
- Wake up, people!

26
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,210
Let's move it!

27
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,146
(pager beeping)

28
00:02:59,146 --> 00:02:59,947
Now.

29
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,516
Let's go!

30
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,351
Get up!

31
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,921
Roll off the rocks!

32
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,323
Get up!

33
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,724
- [Man] All right, boss.

34
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,493
- Damn, I miss Iraq.

35
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,495
All that nice soft sand.

36
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,631
Let's move out!

37
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,606
- [Sheriff] Shirley.

38
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,241
Yeah, Sheriff Scott here.

39
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,277
Yeah, just pulling
 up to the office.

40
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:30,478
Listen, check my mail.

41
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,781
See if my Field &
 Stream showed up yet.

42
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,284
(tense music)

43
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,886
- [Man] Sharon reporting.

44
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,455
Barney just showed up for work.

45
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,394
- [Mars] Affirmative, Sharon.

46
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,629
Hydra, double-check and go.

47
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,903
- [Hydra] Hydra here.

48
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,737
We're at the bank.

49
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,738
Right on schedule.

50
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,807
- [Mars] Jupiter, report.

51
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,175
- [Jupiter] Jupiter here.

52
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,244
All is quiet on
 the Western front.

53
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,680
- [Mars] Proceed with Plan A.

54
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,921
(suspenseful music)

55
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,555
- [Man] Gemini is in position.

56
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,724
- [Woman] Sir, Pony Express
 has passed Checkpoint Alpha.

57
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,959
- [Mars] Good.

58
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,594
Right on schedule.

59
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,096
Now we wait for our Zimbalist.

60
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,401
- [Woman] Pluto,
 keep your eyes open.

61
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,436
- I'm gonna invent a
 butt massage pillow

62
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,872
for these extra long trips.

63
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,207
Welcome to East Bumfuck Nowhere

64
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:11,345
where Hee Haw isn't just a
 show, it's a way of life.

65
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,546
Yeah, boy.

66
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,216
The Bureau could've sent
us to Las Vegas, LA.

67
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,422
But hey, it's Morelli and
Cooper, masters of the barnyard,

68
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:26,360
king of the goddamn
 country road. (laughs)

69
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,397
That's a joke, Lance.

70
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,399
You're supposed to laugh.

71
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,633
Lighten up.

72
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,268
Enjoy life while you can.

73
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,871
Breaks my heart to
 see you wasting away.

74
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,407
I mean, it's not like
 I enjoy preaching

75
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,141
the gospel life to you.

76
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,510
I'm generally the kind of fellow

77
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,212
that likes to mind
 his own business.

78
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,947
You know, pull my
 own toilet paper.

79
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,215
(country music on radio)

80
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,216
Okay, okay, all right.

81
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,484
I will shut up, but, brother,

82
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,353
you gotta turn
 that bullshit off.

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,187
Oh, my.

84
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,925
Waa, waa, hee, haa, haa.

85
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,192
Oh, man.

86
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,027
Please.

87
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,772
- [Pluto] Mars, this is Pluto.

88
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,373
Clavin has arrived.

89
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,614
(upbeat music)

90
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,418
- Hi, cutie.

91
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,352
- [Mailman] Hi, Ms. Ramirez.

92
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,153
- [Ramirez] How are you doing?

93
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,220
Got something for me?

94
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,321
- [Mailman] Here you go.

95
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,491
- Thanks a bunch.

96
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,925
Hey, Agnes.

97
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,463
Hearing aid down again? (laughs)

98
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,630
- [Pluto] Pluto reporting.

99
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,632
Lucy just got her check.

100
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,939
- [Lance] 114 Dumont,
 no description.

101
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,441
- It's simple.

102
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,009
Look for the blandest
 house on the street.

103
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,143
Standard government issue.

104
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,212
Aha, what did I tell you?

105
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,726
(knocking on door)

106
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:09,830
- [Lance] Morning, ma'am.

107
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,532
Agents Cooper and Morelli.

108
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,966
- Any ID?

109
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,801
- Yeah.

110
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,739
- About fucking time.

111
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,242
What took you so long,
 stopped for donuts?

112
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,012
- [Pluto] Pluto here.

113
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:25,946
Lucy's got company.

114
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,947
Looks like two Zimbalists.

115
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,081
One's white, late 20s.

116
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,317
The other's black, mid 30s.

117
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,653
- Nice house.

118
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:33,921
Sort of reminds
 me of your place.

119
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,589
- You're kidding, right?

120
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,991
The FBI placed me in this house.

121
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,794
Might as well be living
in a trailer park.

122
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,965
By the way, I hope you
 guys have a very big trunk.

123
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,736
My old man Tony used to
 bitch about my overpacking,

124
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:49,670
but what can you do?

125
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,539
You are what you wear.

126
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,874
Not that it matters
 in this hick town.

127
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,409
Around here, they have
two fashion statements,

128
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,345
burlap and flannel.

129
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,049
They think tres chic is
a god in Saudi Arabia.

130
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,284
You feds promised me witness
 protection and instead,

131
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,920
you gave me a two-year
sentence in Green Acres.

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,321
I've had it with this place.

133
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,824
It's the most boring
 town in America.

134
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:15,563
Now, what should I wear to meet
those idiots in Washington?

135
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,130
Can't believe those people.

136
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,398
Fucking people.

137
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,704
Don't squint so hard, baby.

138
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,806
You might hurt your eyes.

139
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,644
I can't wait to get out of here.

140
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,546
Where's my shoes?

141
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,082
Can't find my shoes anywhere.

142
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,917
Oh, I have to stop by the bank.

143
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,219
- The bank, ma'am?

144
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,322
- Is there an echo
 here somewhere?

145
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,591
Yeah, the bank.

146
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,861
Uncle Sam, he sends me a little
paycheck every Wednesday,

147
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,030
so I want to cash it ASAP.

148
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:55,603
So, what time did you
guys say the flight was?

149
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,607
What?

150
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,178
- Are you finished
 dressing yet. Ma'am?

151
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,451
- Oh, a Boy Scout.

152
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,821
You ever seen that before?

153
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,256
- You are a class act, ma'am.

154
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,060
- Takes one to know one, baby.

155
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,498
- Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to wear this.

156
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,667
Standard procedure.

157
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,401
- Yeah, right.

158
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,204
I'm gonna flatten my
 boobs like flapjacks.

159
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,741
Nope, I don't think so.

160
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,242
Okay, ready to go.

161
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,787
Well, I'm gonna miss
waking up every morning

162
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,289
to the smell of horse shit.

163
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,123
Not.

164
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,359
- Ms. Daisy.

165
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,000
- [Pluto] Pluto here.

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,969
Lucy is on the move.

167
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,771
- Hydra, this is Mars.

168
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,973
Synchronize forces
 and execute Plan A.

169
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,440
Go.

170
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,943
(tense music)

171
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,872
(air hissing)

172
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,483
- [Sharon] Sharon here.

173
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,819
Barney has been disabled.

174
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,121
I'm moving into position.

175
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,388
- [Ramirez] Look at this town.

176
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,390
It makes Tombstone
 look like Paris.

177
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,359
No movie theater
 for a hundred miles.

178
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,561
Want to meet a guy not
 called Bubba or Moose?

179
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,896
Well, good luck.

180
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,342
Are you coming?

181
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,013
- One agent accompanies
the witness,

182
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,182
one stays in the vehicle.

183
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,351
Standard procedure, ma'am.

184
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,688
- Standard procedure?

185
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,123
Is this guy for real?

186
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,324
Oh, forget it.

187
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,492
- One of the best
 agents in the Bureau.

188
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,128
Of course I am the sexiest.

189
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,629
- What a waste.

190
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,232
He looks like he's got a
 flagpole stuck up his ass.

191
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,067
Look at him.

192
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,869
So handsome and so dull.

193
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,071
What the boy needs
 is a good blowjob.

194
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,073
- I've been feeling a
 little tense myself.

195
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,608
- Oh, don't get your
 hopes up or anything else.

196
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,210
(chuckles)

197
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,679
Friggin' hayseed convention.

198
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,815
You know what's great about
 living in a small town?

199
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,783
- [Morelli] What's that?

200
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,451
- Absofuckinglutely nothing.

201
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,987
How you doing, hon?

202
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,456
(tense music)

203
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,351
- [Morelli] I'll just
 be right over here.

204
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,919
(gun cocks)

205
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,258
- [Mars] All right, high noon.

206
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,627
(gun fires)

207
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,462
(screams)

208
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,629
- [Hydra] Freeze!

209
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,630
Keep you hands
 where I can see 'em.

210
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,298
- All right, all
right, I'm cool.

211
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,132
I'm cool.

212
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,034
- Okay, people.

213
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,502
This is what you think it is.

214
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,803
Everyone on the floor.

215
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,373
- [Robber] Shut the hell up!

216
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,574
- Don't trip any alarms.

217
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,842
Anyone makes a
 sound, we kill you

218
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,044
and the person next to you.

219
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,745
If I hear a word coming
out of any one of you,

220
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,414
I'm gonna stuff every
 one of you motherfuckers.

221
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,049
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

222
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,418
- [Hydra] Janice, get the
 cash, I'll hit the safe.

223
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,286
- [Robber] Who's talking?

224
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,453
You wanna die?

225
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,661
- Now, who's the
 motherfucking branch manager?

226
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,697
- [Woman] Mr. Hastings.

227
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,698
- You, fat boy?

228
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,699
I like fat boys.

229
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,800
More to kill.

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,370
What do you think's
 faster, fat boy,

231
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,839
you or a Teflon coated bullet?

232
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,445
- Damn it, Morelli.

233
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,380
What the fuck is this now?

234
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,348
- [Morelli] Take it
 easy, take it easy.

235
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,917
Just let 'em get the money.

236
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,084
- What do you mean take it easy?

237
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,585
It's my money
 they're taking, okay?

238
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,254
- Shut the fuck up.

239
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,224
Any more noise, I'm gonna
 start killing one at a time.

240
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,758
You got it?

241
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,827
- Oh, Charlie Hastings.

242
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,662
President and fat boy.

243
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,698
Open up the safe.

244
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,734
- [Charlie] I don't
 know the combination.

245
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:28,668
(gun fires)

246
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,237
- Does that refresh your memory?

247
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,471
No?

248
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,273
Fat boy needs a
 little incentive.

249
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,842
Jupiter, bring in another rube.

250
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,312
- [Jupiter] Move it!

251
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,015
- [Robber] Don't
 even think about it.

252
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:54,694
- Fat boy, or I'll kill another
customer every 30 seconds.

253
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,466
Fat boy, are you gonna
take all day long, huh?

254
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,833
Are you trying to mess with me?

255
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,969
Is that what you're doing?

256
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:02,802
- [Charlie] No, sir.

257
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,204
I wouldn't do that.

258
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,472
Just give me another minute.

259
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,739
Please, just a minute.

260
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,008
- [Hydra] See this nice lady?

261
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,709
In a few seconds her nice brains

262
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,080
are gonna be splattered
 all over your nice carpet.

263
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,514
You think I won't do it?

264
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,782
You think again.

265
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,450
I'll snuff all of you
 white trash rednecks.

266
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,285
- [Charlie] I've almost got it.

267
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,220
See, I'm almost there.

268
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,055
- Any of you hicks
 move and you're dead.

269
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,091
Do you think I'm stupid?

270
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,592
(gun thuds)

271
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,895
I need to impress on
you how serious we are.

272
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,730
Kill that lady in red.

273
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,702
(gun fires)
 (woman screaming)

274
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,205
(guns firing)

275
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,143
Janice, take out these inbreds.

276
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,150
(grunting)

277
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,023
Kill her!

278
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,758
(gun firing)

279
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,592
Kill her.

280
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,428
Don't let her get away.

281
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,663
(yelling)

282
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,066
(gun firing)

283
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,669
- [Mars] Cover the front door.

284
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,172
(guns firing)

285
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,754
- [Ramirez] Come on, Morelli.

286
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,589
Why don't you help me?

287
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,299
(tense music)

288
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,005
(yelling)

289
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,509
(guns firing)

290
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,993
- Zimbalist!

291
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,228
Take him out!

292
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,730
(guns firing)

293
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,068
- Yes, Cooper.

294
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,575
What's going on, Cooper?

295
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,410
What's going on?

296
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,344
Who are these people?

297
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,678
Cooper, tell me what's going on.

298
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,013
- Oh, god, Beau.

299
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,450
- You keep him pinned
 down, I'll flank him.

300
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,951
Do you understand?

301
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,322
- [Lance] Beau, Beau.

302
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,156
God, Beau.

303
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,159
- Who blocked my car?

304
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,162
Who the hell's pile
 of shit is this?

305
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,968
You damn woman.

306
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,471
- [Man] Barney Fife
 is heading your way.

307
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,805
ETA at the bank, eight minutes.

308
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,241
Moving to standby position.

309
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,074
- Go.

310
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,810
(gun firing)

311
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,812
- Don't you die on me, Beau.

312
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,914
- This is no bank robbery.

313
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,583
These guys are pros.

314
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,955
It's a set-up.

315
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,257
It's a set-up.

316
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,090
The woman.

317
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:18,631
The woman.

318
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,700
- Oh, yeah, right.

319
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,302
Blame it on me now.

320
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,910
- Look at me, Beau.

321
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,145
It's gonna be all right.

322
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:32,979
Beau!

323
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,382
(gun firing)

324
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:38,985
Damn it, Beau.

325
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,859
(gun firing)

326
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,730
- Shirley, look, call Tucson.

327
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,434
See if you can get some backup.

328
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,469
- Neptune, intercept
 communication.

329
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,472
- [Neptune] Roger,
 we are tapped in.

330
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,775
- [Woman On Phone]
 Tucson State Police,

331
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,710
this is Fredricksville.

332
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,478
Come in, please.

333
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,414
- This is Tucson State
 Police Headquarters.

334
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,015
- [Woman On Phone] We have
 a bank robbery in progress.

335
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:09,949
We need help.

336
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,418
- Affirmative, Fredricksville.

337
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,685
You may be in luck.

338
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,187
I've got some federal
 boys in the vicinity.

339
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,121
I'll try and reach 'em.

340
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,523
They might make it in 10.

341
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,958
(gun firing)

342
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,370
- This is not working.

343
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,805
This guy is packing
more than the regulation

344
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,074
two mags for a Zimbalist.

345
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,276
We keep trying to bleed him,

346
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,445
he keeps coming back
like the battery bunny.

347
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,312
- [Mars] Keep him pinned down.

348
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,747
I'll send backup.

349
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,450
- [Woman] Converge on the bank.

350
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,284
What's your ETA?

351
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,752
- [Man] ETA two minutes.

352
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,720
- [Mars] Hydra, backup will
 be there in two minutes.

353
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,022
Keep them pinned down.

354
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,525
(guns firing)

355
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,002
- Keep your head down.

356
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,982
- [Mars] Pluto, Sharon, report.

357
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:16,916
- [Pluto] One minute away.

358
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,717
Over.

359
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,723
- [Mars] Hydra, backup
 is one minute away.

360
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,557
- Fine.

361
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,392
Oh, fine.

362
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,225
Oh, fine.

363
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,898
I'm almost out of bullets.

364
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,708
- We have to get out of here.

365
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,679
All right, we go
 on a clip change.

366
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,184
When I say now.

367
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,654
(guns firing)

368
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,994
(metal clicking)

369
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:04,497
Now!

370
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:07,834
Go!

371
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,001
Move, move!

372
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,802
- Backup, backup.

373
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:10,803
How far away are you?

374
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,039
- [Pluto] ETA 30 seconds.

375
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,973
- Goddamn it, backup.

376
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,575
Move your ass!

377
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,077
(guns firing)

378
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,466
Shit!

379
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,199
Mars, they're out in the open.

380
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,300
- Shit.

381
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,003
- Pluto, they're
coming your way.

382
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:45,938
Plan B.

383
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,075
- Strike force, Plan B is a go.

384
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,076
Hydra, pursue.

385
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,478
Janice, clean up.

386
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,916
(gun firing)

387
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,719
(tires squealing)

388
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,929
(gun firing)

389
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,300
- You dickhead!

390
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,802
You call this
 witness protection?

391
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,804
Blow it out of your asshole!

392
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,607
(gun firing)

393
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,941
- I've got 'em pinned down.

394
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,476
You flank 'em.
 - Hydra, we have a visual.

395
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:26,479
- [Hydra] Move it,
 move it, move it.

396
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,554
- [Mars] Hurry up, damn it!

397
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:35,555
Cut 'em off!

398
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,424
- What?

399
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,257
What?

400
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:46,766
You're gonna get me
 killed, you pea brain.

401
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,802
- FBI, ma'am.

402
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:50,970
I'll drive.

403
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,440
(guns firing)

404
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,148
Get down!

405
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,116
Come on, down!

406
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,452
- What the hell are you doing?

407
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:08,287
(tires squealing)

408
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,292
Okay.

409
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,294
Okay, let me go, Cooper.

410
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:18,831
Oh, God.

411
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:19,999
- [Lance] Stay down.

412
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,468
- Please, Cooper.

413
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:25,204
Would you mind not stuffing
 my face in your crotch?

414
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,277
If you want it that bad,

415
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,981
you should be asking
 nicely, Cooper.

416
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:38,317
Who knows, maybe I'm
 excited by gunfire.

417
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,491
Maybe I'm just in the mood.

418
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:47,627
- It's clear.

419
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,161
You can sit up now.

420
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:49,996
- [Ramirez] Are you sure?

421
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,030
- Yes, yes.

422
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,198
Yes, I'm sure.

423
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,568
- Oh, God.

424
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,837
You're the first man who ever
 shooed me away from there.

425
00:23:57,837 --> 00:23:58,671
Are you gay?

426
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,872
- [Lance] No.

427
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,107
- [Ramirez] Hey,
 it's okay if you are.

428
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,041
- [Lance] Not that it's
any of your business,

429
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,843
but for the record I am not gay.

430
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,444
- [Ramirez] Touchy.

431
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,717
- Federal Agents
 Weaver and Spencer.

432
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,919
No escalation unless I initiate.

433
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,421
- By definition,
 I'm not an amateur.

434
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,656
- I know you're not.

435
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,925
No offense intended.

436
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,259
- Stay back, boys.

437
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,861
- Is he dead?

438
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,029
What happened?

439
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,470
(tense music)

440
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,874
Oh, my god.

441
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,109
Somebody call an ambulance.

442
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,920
- [Sheriff] Are you the
feds Shirley called in?

443
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,889
- Agent Weaver.

444
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,091
This is my colleague
 Agent Spencer.

445
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,593
You okay, Sheriff?

446
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,729
- [Sheriff] They're
 all dead in there.

447
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:57,897
I know all them people.

448
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,732
I know their families.

449
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,834
- Jesus.

450
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,202
- Kane and Brody did this.

451
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,236
It's gotta be them, Weaver.

452
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,071
Same MO.

453
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,541
- Who?

454
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,143
- Couple of psychos the Bureau's
been tracking for months.

455
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:14,881
Rumors placed them in this
 area, but we never thought...

456
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,583
Sheriff, I realize
 you're in charge here.

457
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,417
I don't want to
 step on any toes,

458
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:22,154
but I'd love to give you a
hand in nailing these bastards.

459
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,990
- I could use
 every hand you got.

460
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,191
- We have associates
 in the area.

461
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,959
We'll call 'em in.

462
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,161
Sheriff, we'll confer in
your office in an hour.

463
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,897
- [Sheriff] Sure.

464
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,364
- I've never been through
 anything like this

465
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,200
my whole fucking life.

466
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:39,071
Well, looks like you
lost my relatives, baby.

467
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,741
- I'll contact the
 Bureau, get help.

468
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,576
- Oh, screw the Bureau, will ya?

469
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,111
Grow up.

470
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,445
Everybody's on the take.

471
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,881
Players switch sides.

472
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,886
- Yeah, I can clear this
 mess up with one phone call.

473
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,121
- Yeah, right.

474
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,255
Right.

475
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,156
Okay, Einstein.

476
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,859
Go make your phone call.

477
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,861
I've gotta go pee anyway.

478
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,400
- [Man On Radio]
 All units, Code One.

479
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,202
Stand by for a 211 broadcast
 for Fredricksville.

480
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,370
- Hydra, this is Mars.

481
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,705
Come in.

482
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,373
- Affirmative, Mars.

483
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:16,909
We, um...

484
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,878
We lost her, sir.

485
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,346
They're mobile now.

486
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:24,717
- There is only one route out
 of this godforsaken place,

487
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,719
so proceed with Plan B.

488
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,355
Divide your forces,
 set up roadblocks,

489
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,991
and them off before
they reach civilization.

490
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,593
- We won't miss
 her this time, sir.

491
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,595
- We just have to go to
 the next level of the game.

492
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,031
- This is not a game.

493
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,900
Games are for
 amateurs and children,

494
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,935
not professional soldiers.

495
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,504
Worst thing we can do is
 take our enemy too lightly.

496
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,806
I've seen infantry get butchered

497
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,908
because they
 underestimated the enemy.

498
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:53,079
I'm not going to let that
 happen under my command.

499
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:57,149
I didn't mean to insult you.

500
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,853
I apologize the second time
 today for lecturing you.

501
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:04,423
You know no one thinks more
 highly of you than I do.

502
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,925
- [Hydra] All right, fall in.

503
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:09,762
Tango Unit, comb the fields
 between here and the highway.

504
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,764
Bravo Unit, hit the
 road heading north.

505
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,099
Report in to me
 every 10 minutes.

506
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:13,933
Let's go.

507
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,177
(engine revving)

508
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,382
- [Man On Radio] Shootout at
the Fredricksville Western Bank

509
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,384
left at least eight people dead.

510
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,321
Police are giving the following
description of the suspects.

511
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:39,525
One male six foot, late
20s, light brown hair.

512
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:43,195
One Hispanic female,
brunette, five foot six.

513
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,965
Both should be considered
 armed and dangerous.

514
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,367
Now back to our regular news.

515
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,872
- Where are the restrooms?

516
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:53,706
Thanks.

517
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,242
- [Attendant] Little
 lady all right?

518
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,910
- She'll live.

519
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,278
Fill it up.

520
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,512
- [Man On Radio]
 Misrepresenting the facts

521
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,680
and challenging the
 government to present

522
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,084
any witnesses to support
their accusations.

523
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,025
- [Woman On Phone] Operator 123.

524
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:13,960
How may I help you?

525
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,295
- Collect, Agent Cooper.

526
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,497
- [Operator On
 Phone] Hold, please.

527
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,832

- [Operator On Phone] Collect
 call from Agent Cooper.

530
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,137
Will you accept?

531
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,372
- [Woman On Phone]
 Yes, we'll accept.

532
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,574
- [Lance] Deputy
 Bureau Chief Crispin.

533
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,408
- [Woman On Phone]
 Hold the line, please,

534
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,077
while I connect you.

535
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,913
(inspiring music)

536
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,851
(phone rings)

537
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,119
- Crispin.

538
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:40,987
- [Woman On Phone] Sir,
Agent Cooper is calling.

539
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,922
- Yeah, put him on.

540
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,256
Cooper, what's going on?

541
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,592
Why aren't you calling
 on a secured line?

542
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,295
- Sir, I'm in a hell
 of a storm down here.

543
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,899
We walked into an
ambush with the witness.

544
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,001
And, sir, Morelli's dead.

545
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,139
- Oh, Jesus.

546
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,843
Listen, son.

547
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,211
There's something
 you better know.

548
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,579
The woman is Evan Debenedito.

549
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,781
- [Lance On Phone]
 Any relation to?

550
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,283
- Yeah, Tony
Debenedito, the mobster.

551
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,551
His wife.

552
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,786
- [Lance On Phone]
 Now I understand.

553
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,021
- Yeah, she helped to
 put him behind bars

554
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,288
for the better part of
 the next millennium.

555
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,991
- Sir, I need support ASAP.

556
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,160
These guys are pros,
they'll be tracking us.

557
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,661
- [Crispin On Phone]
 Son, listen to me.

558
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,864
I want you to hunker
 down somewhere.

559
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,065
What's your 20?

560
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,333
- I'm at a gas station.

561
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,236
21st mile marker,
 just off Route 66.

562
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,771
- [Pluto] Pluto here.

563
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,640
Good news, we have
 a location on Lucy.

564
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,509
Bad news, the
 Zimbalist phoned home.

565
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,645
- Make your move.

566
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,680
- Saturn, target is
 located at gas station

567
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,816
four miles east of
 your present location.

568
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:44,683
Lock in.

569
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:45,517
- [Saturn] Saturn here.

570
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,352
Copy that.

571
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:47,786
We're on our way.

572
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,657
- All right.

573
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,092
There's an army science facility

574
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:57,229
about five miles
 south-southwest on Highway 66.

575
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,164
- [Mars] Move in.

576
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,331
Remember, focus on the woman.

577
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,734
Don't let the
Zimbalist distract you.

578
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,204
- It's nothing more than a
 glorified weather station,

579
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,139
but it's not far
 from where you are.

580
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,807
I can call ahead, they'll
 be waiting for you.

581
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,942
Can you make it?

582
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:10,776
- Yes, sir.

583
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:11,610
I think so.

584
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,444
- Good.

585
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,279
Good, Cooper.

586
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,113
Be careful.

587
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,381
I'm on my way.

588
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,549
I'm personally coming
 out there to get you.

589
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,550
- [Lance On Phone] Yes, sir.

590
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,751
- Okay.

591
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,654
Now look, you're good
 and you're smart,

592
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,456
so you're gonna make it.

593
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,126
You will do what you have to do.

594
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,062
- I will do what
 I have to do, sir.

595
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,764
(gun cocks)

596
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,234
- Y'all stay real steady now.

597
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,937
There was a bank job
back in Fredricksville,

598
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,107
you got lots of little holes
 in the back of your car.

599
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,742
Man would have to be simple not
to put two and two together.

600
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:44,643
- [Lance] Look, Wally.

601
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,844
That's your name, right?

602
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,646
I wanna show you something.

603
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,949
- Not so fast, mister.

604
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,018
- You got it all wrong.

605
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:52,818
I'm FBI.

606
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,322
- Just throw that over here.

607
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,857
I'm gonna reach for it.

608
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,792
Now don't get smart on me.

609
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,998
(chuckles) I've seen ads
selling stuff like this

610
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,866
in the back of magazines.

611
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,435
- I'm Agent Lance Cooper.

612
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:10,802
Now listen, Wally.

613
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,238
- [Wally] Hey, who
 the hell are you guys?

614
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,072
- Whoa.

615
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,041
Hold on.

616
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,710
Relax, friend.

617
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,012
Federal agents.

618
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,347
- [Wally] What do you want?

619
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,548
- [Pluto] See?

620
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,349
We're pursuing
 some bank robbers.

621
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,183
You caught 'em.

622
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,017
- [Lance] Hold on.

623
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:25,952
Don't trust these guys.

624
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,687
- Is this one of yours?

625
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,788
- Nope.

626
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,390
That there's a fake.

627
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,491
This guy's lying to you.

628
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,659
- Ha, knew it.

629
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,328
- Don't listen to 'em, Wally.

630
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,496
They're lying.

631
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,065
Just keep that gun on them.

632
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,299
I'll call for help.

633
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,900
- [Pluto] Nobody's
 calling anybody.

634
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,171
This guy's a con man as well
 as a thief and a murderer.

635
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,138
Now, put the gun down.

636
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,906
We'll take it from here.

637
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,441
- Don't do it, Wally.

638
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,642
They're lying.

639
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,244
Just hold your ground, okay?

640
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,445
Keep them covered.

641
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,481
- [Wally] Jeez, I
don't like any of this.

642
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,350
(grass rustling)

643
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,987
Hey, what's she
 doing over there?

644
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,456
(guns firing)

645
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,621
(gun fires)
 (yells)

646
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,491
(groans)

647
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,973
(explosion booms)

648
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,578
(grunts)

649
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,317
- [Man On Radio]
Both sides brace

650
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,319
for tomorrow's
congressional hearings.

651
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,289
Senator Ivanovitch has dismissed
the allegations against him

652
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,559
as politically motivated and
 seems confident of the outcome

653
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,295
of tomorrow's anonymous
witness testimony.

654
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,131
- [Mars] Patch me
 through to Zeus.

655
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,669
- [Zeus On Phone] Mars,
give me good news.

656
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,137
- [Mars] Sir, we
are experiencing

657
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,272
some temporary difficulties.

658
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,506
- [Zeus On Phone] What?

659
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,707
If that woman isn't
 dead within the hour.

660
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,076
- Sir, you have my word.

661
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:33,011
The target will be eliminated
 quickly and cleanly.

662
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,446
- [Zeus On Phone] And I
give you my word, Mars.

663
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,815
Screw this up and I'll
 take you down with me hard.

664
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:37,649
You got that?

665
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,285
- [Mars] Yes, sir.

666
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,787
(tense music)

667
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:49,428
(breathing heavily)

668
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,233
- Eva!

669
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,535
- Oh, fuck.

670
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,937
Get lost, you stupid
 son of a bitch!

671
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,173
Go die by your fucking self!

672
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,774
- [Lance] You're coming with me!

673
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,376
- No, I'm not.

674
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,311
For what?

675
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,545
Huh?

676
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,980
You're nothing but a
 fucking delivery boy.

677
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,915
- Yeah?

678
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,983
Well, I'm delivering you.

679
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,125
Oh, oh.

680
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:19,991
Thank God.

681
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:20,826
Hey, hey!

682
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,929
(whistles)

683
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,270
Hey, look at me, I'm here!

684
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,204
- [Taurus] Mars, this is Taurus.

685
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,372
We've got her cold.

686
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,640
- Do it.

687
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,474
- Hey!

688
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,425
(gun firing)

689
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,260
Fuck!

690
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,139
(bones crack)

691
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,495
(gasps)

692
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,763
You want me?

693
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,132
Come and get me.

694
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,407
(yelling)

695
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,148
(metal crunching)

696
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:57,689
- You okay?

697
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,524
- Yes, I'm fine.

698
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,758
I'm fine, okay?

699
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,162
Fuck, man.

700
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,096
You know, you win.

701
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,132
I'm not a class act, okay?

702
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,735
Second time today I
 almost end up dead

703
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:14,306
and what you really care about
 is the fucking way I sit.

704
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,241
Fuck it, let's go.

705
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,742
You're stupid, you know that?

706
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:17,943
Maybe I'm not a class act,

707
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,879
but you are not
 much of a gentleman.

708
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,916
- Two highway patrol
 cars approaching town.

709
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,151
- Eliminate the phone service.

710
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,019
Jam all police bands.

711
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,691
Call Janice back and have him
 intercept the patrol cars.

712
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,595
(metal clinking)

713
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,402
(siren wailing)

714
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:05,223
(tires squealing)

715
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,830
(gun fires)

716
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,664
- [Policeman] We're under fire.

717
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,000
(gun fires)

718
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,835
- [Janice] Janice to Mars.

719
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:17,869
Friday's sound asleep.

720
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,804
- Okay, okay.

721
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,372
Janice, back to the playground.

722
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:21,206
- See?

723
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,508
Just a matter of time.

724
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,242
Best team always wins.

725
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,677
- Let's not take any chances.

726
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:26,645
Put more players in.

727
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,514
Commit more backup.

728
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:31,182
(pager beeping)

729
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,387
- Yo!

730
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,488
You guys, listen up.

731
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,789
We're going hunting.

732
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,591
Biskane, take second team.

733
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,926
The rest with me.

734
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,961
Let's rock and roll!

735
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,531
(men whooping)

736
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,434
- [Eva] Oh, God.

737
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:49,801
I hate walking.

738
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,571
I'd love a taxi right now.

739
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:55,106
You know, in the old days
 if I had to go the 50 yards

740
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,875
from Bergder to Bendel's,

741
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,611
Tony would have a limo
 right there waiting for me.

742
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,714
He knew how to treat a
 lady, unlike some people.

743
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:03,782
Are you listening to me?

744
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,616
Huh?

745
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:11,089
- [Mars On Radio] All units in
 the field, give me a sitrep.

746
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,259
- [Koff] Koff here
 with the first team.

747
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,961
Sector 7G clear.

748
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,162
- [Hydra] This is Hydra.

749
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,464
I'm in sector 8H.

750
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,366
No sign of Lucy.

751
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,033
- [Man] Second team reporting.

752
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,369
Sector 2F clear.

753
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,925
- Hydra to Mars.

754
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,561
Picked up their trail Sector
 4G heading north by northwest.

755
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,330
- [Woman] Closest units
are section 6G and 7H.

756
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,465
They're still 10 minutes away.

757
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,734
I'm arranging an intercept.

758
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,540
- So, where are we off to, baby?

759
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,142
Puerto Vallarta, Tahiti, Vegas?

760
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,513
Oops, sorry.

761
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,147
I forgot.

762
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,316
No money, no car, no guns.

763
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:16,555
I know where we're
going, straight to hell.

764
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,991
- [Lance] You always like this
 or is today just a good day?

765
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,192
- No.

766
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,529
No, Mr. Tight-Ass Fed.

767
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:27,899
I'm only like this when
 folks try to shoot, stab,

768
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,802
run over, and basically kill me.

769
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,138
Only then I'm like this.

770
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,440
- With a personality like yours,

771
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,175
I'm surprised it doesn't
happen more often.

772
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,577
- Oh, a comeback.

773
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,346
Wow.

774
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:45,684
You know, maybe you're
not as dumb as you look.

775
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:49,521
And maybe you even know
 where we're going, do you?

776
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:52,591
- There's an army weather
 station about eight miles off.

777
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:56,728
My boss is gonna pick us
up there in a few hours.

778
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:57,929
- Over that hill?

779
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:01,199
I mean, do I look
 like a mountain goat?

780
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:07,806
Okay.

781
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:08,807
Okay, Mr. Cooper.

782
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,041
I mean, you know.

783
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,777
You're supposed
 to say, no, ma'am,

784
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,579
you do not look like a goat,

785
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,247
you look like a beautiful woman.

786
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,085
All right.

787
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,554
Then, you know, you're
 supposed to (laughs) laugh

788
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,791
like what I just said
 was a joke, okay?

789
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,494
Well, okay, listen to this.

790
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,996
I am staying here
because I am very tired

791
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,831
and I don't give a
 fuck what you say.

792
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,801
And I don't really
care what you do, okay?

793
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,737
And I don't want to walk
anymore with you or nobody else.

794
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:42,273
I don't give a fuck what
 you think or anybody thinks.

795
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,074
Ouch!

796
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,777
- You don't.

797
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,012
- I don't what?

798
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,348
- Look like a goat.

799
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:52,117
- Oh.

800
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,453
Thank you.

801
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,389
Thank you very much.

802
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,761
- [Man] First unit
 moving to coordinates.

803
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,596
Eight minutes to intercept.

804
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,432
(engines revving)

805
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:12,771
- [Man] Copy that.

806
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:13,605
Second unit on the move.

807
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,340
We'll be there in 10.

808
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:18,810
- [Hydra] This is Hydra.

809
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,145
Close in on Sector 4G.

810
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,713
I'm on their trail.

811
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:23,849
- Ouch.

812
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:28,453
My legs are killing me, Cooper.

813
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:34,459
Can we just rest
 for a second here?

814
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,293
- No.

815
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,496
I'm supposed to deliver
 you and I will deliver you.

816
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,198
You will testify tomorrow.

817
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,332
- Why?

818
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,734
Ouch.

819
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,836
Why is this so damn
 important to you?

820
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,339
- Because it's my job and
that's what I'm supposed to do.

821
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,641
- Yeah, right.

822
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:54,045
And you always do what
 you're supposed to do.

823
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,313
Fuck, man.

824
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,616
I mean, that's so
 fucking boring.

825
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,326
- [Hydra] Hydra here.

826
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,327
I've located Lucy.

827
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,897
Northwest corner of Sector 4G.

828
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:14,666
Converge on my
 coordinates, stat.

829
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,441
- [Eva] I'm so thirsty.

830
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,512
- We'll have to go this way.

831
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,548
- Okay, Mr. Cooper.

832
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,019
I can handle it.

833
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:39,324
(tense music)

834
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,032
- [Mars] Hydra, report.

835
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:49,701
- I'm trying to get a good shot.

836
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,011
Stay fucking still, bitch.

837
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,214
- Cooper, I'm dying.

838
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,549
No, I mean, this is serious.

839
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,383
I am.

840
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,786
I'm very hungry.

841
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:10,055
- Keep away from the trees.

842
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,792
Just lean forward.

843
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,226
Stay still.

844
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,362
- I'm thirsty, Cooper.

845
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:18,196
Cooper!

846
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,700
- Damn it.

847
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,269
- You know, I'm talking
to you here, okay?

848
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,536
Are you deaf?

849
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,738
I mean, you know,
 I'm talking to you

850
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,139
and you haven't heard
 a word I've said.

851
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,841
Will you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

852
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,309
And ever since over there,

853
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,111
I've been trying to be nice
 to you and not complain.

854
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,014
(gun fires)

855
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:36,848
Help me.

856
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:37,683
- Listen to me.

857
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:38,784
Listen, listen.

858
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:41,052
(gun fires)

859
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,688
- Help me.

860
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:44,389
- Mars, send me backup.

861
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,091
I've got 'em pinned down.

862
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,759
(gun fires)

863
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,762
Northwest corner of Sector 7G.

864
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,463
- Move in, everyone.

865
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,364
- [Man] First unit here.

866
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,966
Four minutes away.

867
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:55,901
(gun fires)

868
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:57,435
- Listen.

869
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,604
They're firing 50 caliber
 shells from a sniper rifle.

870
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,572
Probably a Barrett M82A1.

871
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,509
It'll put a hole the
 size of a grapefruit

872
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,712
in that lovely body of yours.

873
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:07,946
(gun fires)

874
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:08,847
- How do you know all that?

875
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,682
Are you fucking crazy?.

876
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:11,549
- Marines.

877
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,018
I was a sharpshooter.

878
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,353
(gun fires)

879
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:20,491
- Do you really think I
have a lovely body, huh?

880
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,760
(gun fires)

881
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,329
- We've gotta find
 that army shelter.

882
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,496
- Come on, you guys.

883
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,932
I can't keep 'em pinned
down here forever.

884
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:27,866
- [Man] Hold on.

885
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,101
We're only two minutes away.

886
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,205
(gun fires)

887
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,974
(gasps)

888
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,443
(gun fires)

889
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:41,346
(engines revving)

890
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,448
(gun fires)

891
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:44,850
- 15.

892
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,683
(gun fires)

893
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,885
16, 17.

894
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:47,786
(gun fires)

895
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:48,619
18.

896
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,221
- Let go of me.

897
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,222
(gun fires)

898
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,058
- What are you doing?
 - 19.

899
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,225
(gun fires)

900
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:55,226
20.

901
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,061
Let's go.

902
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:56,962
- Oh, God.

903
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:58,163
I'm gonna get killed.

904
00:44:58,163 --> 00:44:58,997
- Mag change.

905
00:44:58,997 --> 00:44:59,831
Let's go.

906
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,666
- I'm gonna get killed.

907
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,774
- [Hydra] Damn it, they're gone.

908
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:11,009
Who the hell is this guy?

909
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:11,843
- [Man] Where are they?

910
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,078
- [Hydra] They got away.

911
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,312
This guy's good.

912
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,246
- [Mars] Silence.

913
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,447
They can't have gotten far.

914
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,315
Cross the sector
 and flush them out.

915
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,583
Move.

916
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,785
- Don't worry, once
 we get out of this,

917
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:21,853
the Bureau will set
you up somewhere quiet.

918
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:22,687
- Yeah, right.

919
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,155
Dream on, sweet cheeks.

920
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,490
I've given this a lot of thought

921
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,958
and I'd prefer to
 run my whole life

922
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,594
than to be Eva Ramirez
 one more friggin' minute.

923
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,662
- You should've thought
of that before you

924
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,698
rolled over on your husband
 and his extended family.

925
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,300
- Hey!

926
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,902
Hey, you motherfucker.

927
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,603
You motherfucker.

928
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:41,506
It was you feds who set me up.

929
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:44,309
I wouldn't talk, not a word.

930
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,312
So you guys told Tony that I
 had already spilled my guts

931
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:50,081
and then he sent some
people to kill me, okay?

932
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,084
So then I didn't
 have a choice, did I?

933
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,586
- No, there's always a choice.

934
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,589
You are what you do.

935
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,258
Everything else is just talk.

936
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,359
- Oh, yeah?

937
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,493
- Yeah.

938
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,130
- And who made you Pope, huh?

939
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,731
No skeletons in your closet?

940
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:08,766
A little payoff
 here and there, huh?

941
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,070
No hanky panky behind
 the wife's back, huh?

942
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,371
Bullshit!

943
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,605
You think you're perfect.

944
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,440
Ha.

945
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,507
Yeah, right, I doubt it.

946
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,708
Nobody is.

947
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,310
For the right price,
you'd betray everything.

948
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,312
You just haven't been
 tempted, that's all.

949
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,147
Huh?

950
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,158
- This Zimbalist, what's
so special about him?

951
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,028
Why is this so difficult?

952
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,830
Could this be a trap?

953
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,664
No.

954
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,200
Is that his profile coming in?

955
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,034
- Mm-hmm.

956
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,469
Lance Cooper.

957
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,406
Former staff sergeant, US
Marine Corp Recon, sharpshooter,

958
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:52,277
light and heavy weapons, hand
 to hand, Panama, Desert Storm,

959
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:56,447
Silver Star, Purple Heart,
 four years with the Bureau.

960
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,016
Lost his wife.

961
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,585
Raped and murdered
 in their home.

962
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,821
Seems that Cooper took the
 law into his own hands.

963
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,491
Disciplinary action, reassigned.

964
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,030
- So, the system has
 already let him down once.

965
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,531
Shame.

966
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,465
Spread the word.

967
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,401
This is no ordinary Zimbalist.

968
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,569
Combat veteran, Semper Fi.

969
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:20,738
A worthy enemy.

970
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,173
I'd like to have met him.

971
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,608
A fellow warrior.

972
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,648
- So how far, Cooper?

973
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,217
Just over the hill.

974
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,220
Testify, they said.

975
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,389
We'll protect you, they said.

976
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,690
Yeah, right.

977
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,092
They didn't fucking
 tell me anything about

978
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:43,228
climbing Mount Everest.

979
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,762
If these guys wind
 up killing me,

980
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:46,932
they would really
 be doing me a favor.

981
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,533
I'm not kidding, I'm not.

982
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,500
Two and a half years of playing

983
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,802
a goody two shoes country girl.

984
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,638
I was dying of boredom.

985
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:55,806
Well, at least this is quicker.

986
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,643
What did you just
 look at Bigfoot?

987
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:05,951
- They're boxing us in.

988
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:09,354
Whoever's running this
 op is a military man.

989
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:12,457
These guys aren't regular
 mob muscle, they're pros.

990
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,792
Somebody's paying a lot of
 money to keep you quiet.

991
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:17,195
- I told you my mouth
 is like a trumpet.

992
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:19,564
Walls of Jericho
 be shaking, baby.

993
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,199
- We gotta make it
 over by nightfall.

994
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,767
Link up with my boss.

995
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,102
- Fucking be-whoopity-doo
 your boss.

996
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:27,072
You think he's gonna
get us out of this mess?

997
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,740
What's that Boy Scout motto?

998
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,510
Pray for the best
 and spread disaster.

999
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,945
Is that what it is?

1000
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,146
- It's be prepared.

1001
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,747
- Oh, same shit.

1002
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,349
Ow, my shoe.

1003
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,550
Fuck.

1004
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,252
- [Man On Radio] This
 is Tucson Control.

1005
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,089
All cleared for
 landing, Hero One.

1006
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,097
- [Man] Sir, your team
 is waiting for you.

1007
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,364
- [Crispin] Any word
 from Agent Cooper?

1008
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,533
- [Agent] No, sir.

1009
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,767
- How far away are we?

1010
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,769
- [Agent] About two hours, sir.

1011
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,770
- Damn it.

1012
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,106
Can't this crate
move any faster?

1013
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,073
Floor it, let's go.

1014
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,641
(gun cocks)

1015
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,644
(breathing heavily)

1016
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,182
Oh.

1017
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,083
Oh, a road.

1018
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:14,519
Thank God.

1019
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,255
It's gonna be so
much easier now.

1020
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,058
Water, Cooper.

1021
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:20,891
Hot meal.

1022
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:26,464
Even army food will
 taste good about now.

1023
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,536
What?

1024
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,204
Where are you going?

1025
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,207
What are you doing?

1026
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,242
Can't you read?

1027
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:38,509
I mean, look.

1028
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:41,179
I mean, the weather
 station is that way.

1029
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,581
- You know, silence is a virtue.

1030
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:44,415
- Yeah?

1031
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:45,916
Well, virtue's boring.

1032
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,087
If silence is a virtue, that's
 why I'm such a blabbermouth.

1033
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,288
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1034
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,790
What are you doing now, huh?

1035
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,624
Will you?

1036
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,793
(engines revving)

1037
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:58,129
- [Lance] Come on, let's go.

1038
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,305
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1039
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,679
(breathing heavily)

1040
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,880
Ow, my legs.

1041
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,747
- [Lance] No.

1042
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,015
We'll go this way.

1043
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,417
We want them to follow us.

1044
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:22,287
- What do you mean you
want them to follow us?

1045
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:23,121
- Come on.

1046
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,055
- No, no, no, no, no.

1047
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:25,290
No, I don't want to get wet.

1048
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,091
- Come on, come on.
 - No, no, no, no.

1049
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:27,592
I don't like the water.

1050
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:31,162
Ah, there's a million little
 bugs underneath the water.

1051
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,230
Let go of me.

1052
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:35,533
Aye yi yi yi.

1053
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:42,973
Ah.

1054
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,115
Oh, it feels so good.

1055
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:51,982
- Come on.

1056
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,284
Eva.

1057
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,087
(engines revving)

1058
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,665
(tense music)

1059
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,574
- Mars, this is Team Two.

1060
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,210
We've picked up
 the enemy's trail.

1061
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,044
Come on.

1062
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,814
(engine revving)

1063
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,371
- I had a dog who used to do
 that all the time, you know.

1064
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:48,506
I had to put him to sleep.

1065
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,976
Just kidding.

1066
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,012
God, smile.

1067
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,414
It's just a joke.

1068
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,784
- [Man] Second unit here.

1069
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,085
We're closing in.

1070
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,655
- Hey, Cooper.

1071
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,224
Is this big enough?

1072
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:09,694
Tarzan!

1073
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,296
Is this big enough?

1074
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,331
- Yes, ma'am.

1075
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:14,432
- [Eva] Okay.

1076
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,646
(grunts)

1077
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,416
(dramatic music)

1078
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,452
(grunts)

1079
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:44,161
- Your marine's putting
on quite a show.

1080
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:51,736
(grunting)

1081
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:59,477
- Fuck.

1082
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,381
(grunting)

1083
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,021
Shit, girl.

1084
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,623
You're out-classed.

1085
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,294
(bones crack)

1086
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:18,195
Fuck.

1087
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,406
Cooper, did you see that?

1088
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,240
Did you see that?

1089
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,541
Fuck me.

1090
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,709
Fuck, a bike.

1091
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,577
Can I drive it?

1092
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:34,011
Can I drive it, please?

1093
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:36,681
- I'm sure you're a fine rider,
but I've done this before.

1094
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,283
- Well, me too.

1095
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:39,584
- It's my job to protect you.

1096
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,418
Get on.

1097
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,252
- Oh, yeah?

1098
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,420
- [Lance] Yeah.

1099
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,955
- Well, will you
 take a bullet for me?

1100
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,892
- I'd rather not,
 but if I have to.

1101
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,627
- Well, how romantic.

1102
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:51,962
Let's go.

1103
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:52,797
Yeah!

1104
00:53:58,869 --> 00:53:59,937
- [Mars] Come in Unit Two.

1105
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,906
Team leader, do you copy?

1106
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:12,817
- [Koff] Mars, this is Koff.

1107
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:14,218
They slipped through.

1108
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,653
- [Mars] This is
 an embarrassment.

1109
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:16,887
- [Koff] There's a bike missing.

1110
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,323
They're mobile again.

1111
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:19,724
- We could've nailed
 them here, here, or here.

1112
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:21,426
- Sir, he's on a motorbike
 on rocky terrain.

1113
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,461
Average speed, 25 miles an hour.

1114
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:26,397
- That puts them
 within this radius.

1115
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:29,800
Koff, sweep through
 sections D through H.

1116
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,235
Look under every rock.

1117
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:33,037
And don't fucking fail again.

1118
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:33,871
- [Koff] Roger that, Mars.

1119
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:34,705
Moving in.

1120
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:42,079
(upbeat music)

1121
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:57,962
- [Lance] Hey, hey.

1122
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,096
Cut that out.

1123
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:00,365
- What?

1124
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,834
- This is not the right
time for you know.

1125
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,236
- Oh, Cooper.

1126
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,639
Any time is good for you know.

1127
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,277
And anyway, I am just
 being me, all right?

1128
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:17,482
I mean, I didn't get to be
 me for two and a half years.

1129
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:19,517
Anyway, I'm not trying
 to, like, you know,

1130
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:22,219
pull down your pants
 and jump on you.

1131
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,489
Well, unless you beg me to.

1132
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,728
God, can you loosen up?

1133
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:32,262
We just killed those
 people over there

1134
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,533
and maybe in half an hour
 they want to kill us too,

1135
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:38,202
so why can't we just be friends?

1136
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,605
Huh?

1137
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,711
- The weather station
is still 25 miles away.

1138
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:48,413
Step on it.

1139
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:51,516
Nobody opens fire without
 my say so, all right?

1140
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:53,117
- [Agent] Yes, sir.

1141
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,856
- You're Agent Cooper,
 you're on a bike,

1142
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,224
enemy troops are everywhere.

1143
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,426
What do you do?

1144
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:06,130
- Two possible windows.

1145
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,966
The creek, follow it downstream.

1146
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,636
The shores are smooth allowing
 for peak bike performance,

1147
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:13,103
eventually it leads
 to the highway.

1148
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,541
- Drawback, we could ambush
 him at the first bridge.

1149
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:21,278
- Or he could retreat, say,
 to the old factory here.

1150
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:23,848
Hide out till dark, try
to slip through our net.

1151
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,250
- Drawback, he'd be backing
 himself into a corner,

1152
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,685
trapping himself.

1153
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,389
Here or here, but which?

1154
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,170
- [Man] Mars, we swept
 sectors E through H.

1155
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,039
No sign of Lucy
 or the Zimbalist.

1156
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:51,108
- Agent Cooper's a marine.

1157
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:54,378
What do they say,
 take the high ground?

1158
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:01,986
- Hydra, we have reason
to believe that Cooper

1159
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:04,455
and the mark have
 retreated to a factory

1160
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:06,724
a mile from your
 present location.

1161
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,426
Surround the place and
wait until I get there.

1162
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,595
- [Hydra] Hydra here.

1163
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,963
ETA at the factory,
 eight minutes.

1164
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:13,898
- [Janice] Janice here.

1165
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:15,165
Linking up with first unit

1166
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,634
and converging on
 the factory, sir.

1167
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:20,905
In pursuit to be at the
 factory in about 10 minutes.

1168
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,046
- Okay, now we're into it.

1169
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:32,382
- [Koff] Bravo Two with
eight minutes away.

1170
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:33,317
- [Man] Copy that, Koff.

1171
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,319
We'll be there first.

1172
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,322
Cover the grid
 before they get here.

1173
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:43,427
(gasps)

1174
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:55,005
(engines revving)

1175
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,626
- [Lance] Change of plans.

1176
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:16,861
They've figured out our course.

1177
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:18,796
We'll have to ditch
 the bike and hide out.

1178
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:20,430
We'll use the dark as cover.

1179
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,569
- [Eva] How long are
 we gonna stay here?

1180
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,770
It's cold.

1181
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,805
- We'll hold up
 here till daybreak.

1182
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:29,006
Check the bike for a flashlight.

1183
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,274
- Where are you going?

1184
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:32,677
- [Lance] Set up a
 little insurance.

1185
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:33,678
- Insurance?

1186
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:35,580
Men.

1187
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:40,951
- [Koff] Koff here.

1188
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:43,954
My team's ETA to the
 factory six minutes.

1189
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,630
- Now what, Cooper?

1190
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:55,933
What a dump.

1191
00:58:55,933 --> 00:59:00,004
Reminds me when Tony and I
 did to for the first time.

1192
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:00,805
- [Janice] Janice here.

1193
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:01,606
I'm with Unit One.

1194
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:03,107
Four minutes away.

1195
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:10,214
(tense music)

1196
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:16,921
- [Mars] I want
 all units to create

1197
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,089
an offensive perimeter
 around the factory.

1198
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,858
Don't move a muscle
 until I get there.

1199
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,792
Copy that?

1200
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:22,660
- [Man] We copy that, Mars.

1201
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,994
That is a roger.

1202
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,469
- [Lance] Here.

1203
00:59:33,938 --> 00:59:35,606
This should be safe.

1204
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:43,848
Front door is secured and
 we can see everything.

1205
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,625
- [Eva] This is the
 first time all day

1206
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:57,327
people are not
 trying to kill us.

1207
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,429
My poor feet.

1208
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,643
Oh, they're killing me.

1209
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,178
Oh, look at my legs.

1210
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:17,547
It's gonna take me forever to
 get rid of all these bruises.

1211
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:21,385
- Can you try and sit
 like a lady for once?

1212
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:24,321
- Aye, what the fuck's
 wrong with the way I sit?

1213
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,856
Huh, Cooper?

1214
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:26,857
I mean, God.

1215
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,026
What is the problem?

1216
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:30,260
Doesn't your wife
 ever sit like this

1217
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,962
just to tease you a
 little bit, you know?

1218
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,497
- No.

1219
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:34,398
She's gone.

1220
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,867
- Oh, poor you.

1221
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:41,171
What'd she do, run away
with an insurance man,

1222
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:44,341
marry him, have two and
a half kids and a dog?

1223
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,142
- No.

1224
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:49,379
She died.

1225
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,917
(subdued music)

1226
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:54,885
- I'm sorry.

1227
01:00:58,588 --> 01:00:59,857
I'm sorry.

1228
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:01,892
Mom always said that
 I had a big mouth.

1229
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:02,727
I know.

1230
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,997
Was she young?

1231
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,268
- Yeah.

1232
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,240
- [Eva] I'm sorry, Cooper.

1233
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,407
I had no idea.

1234
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:22,012
- [Hydra] Hydra in position.

1235
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:22,947
- [Mars] Good.

1236
01:01:22,947 --> 01:01:25,082
Janice, move into position.

1237
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,888
All other units,
 cover every exit.

1238
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,122
No gaps.

1239
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:35,259
I want that place
 locked up tight.

1240
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:36,894
- [Hydra] All units
 are in position.

1241
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:39,696
Offensive perimeter
 is established.

1242
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,798
- Okay, okay.

1243
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,770
Command station has
reached the target zone.

1244
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:49,874
Prepare to commence
 a full-scale assault.

1245
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,175
- It's freezing.

1246
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:57,681
Cooper, um...

1247
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,287
What a fucking day we've had.

1248
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:08,192
For a while there I thought
you would betray me, but now...

1249
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:10,394
Cooper, I want to ask
 you for something,

1250
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,862
but I don't want you to think

1251
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:15,199
like I'm coming onto you
or anything like that.

1252
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,101
You know, it is fucking
cold here, okay?

1253
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:18,668
I mean, I am cold.

1254
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:19,804
Besides being
 hungry, and thirsty,

1255
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,972
and tired, and everything.

1256
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,710
I was just wondering
 if you could, like,

1257
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:30,214
hug me or something, you know?

1258
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:35,019
I just need a little
 bit of body heat.

1259
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:38,255
I promise, I'll behave.

1260
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,924
I'll be a good girl.

1261
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:45,562
Besides, I am not feeling
 too sexy right now.

1262
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:46,396
I'm not.

1263
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,866
I'm just cold.

1264
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,479
(subdued music)

1265
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,153
See?

1266
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:12,522
I don't bite,

1267
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,327
unless you want me to.

1268
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:21,999
I am just kidding, Cooper.

1269
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,834
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1270
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:24,668
God.

1271
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,073
You're so fucking serious, man.

1272
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:29,907
You know?

1273
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,411
You know, Cooper.

1274
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:39,183
Once you get to know me, deep,
 deep, deep, deep, deep down,

1275
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,618
I'm not really that bad.

1276
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,637
- [Mars] All units,
 establish fire base.

1277
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,940
Neptune, set the detonators.

1278
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:11,115
- If we have the luxury,
can I claim Lucy?

1279
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:13,117
- The kill is all yours.

1280
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:20,457
(tense music)

1281
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,854
Get ready to attack
 on my command.

1282
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,022
- [Hydra] Copy that, Mars.

1283
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,057
- [Man] Copy that.

1284
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,459
- [Man] Roger, Mars.

1285
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:58,128
(clock ticking)

1286
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,799
- [Mars] All units, move in.

1287
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:10,140
(gun firing)

1288
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,375
- They're here.

1289
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,946
- Janice has uncovered
 the Zimbalist, sir.

1290
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:17,347
Come on, move in.

1291
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,585
- No, there's too much gunfire.

1292
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,553
Cooper knows he's outnumbered.

1293
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,155
He wouldn't be wasting ammo.

1294
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:26,223
Pull back.

1295
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,657
It's a diversion.

1296
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:38,568
- [Eva] What is it?

1297
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,370
- [Lance] I don't know.

1298
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,406
- Cooper, I thought you
 said that we were gonna use

1299
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:44,241
the darkness as cover.

1300
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,945
And for a second I was
beginning to trust you.

1301
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,548
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

1302
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,917
- [Lance] Could be an animal.

1303
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:54,751
Maybe.

1304
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:07,597
(explosion booms)

1305
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:10,767
(engines revving)

1306
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,002
- [Hydra] Move in.

1307
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:15,272
All of the mobile
 units, cover me.

1308
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,106
Flank left.

1309
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,674
Find the woman.

1310
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:18,842
- Shit.

1311
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:19,676
- What's happening?

1312
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:20,644
Where are they now?

1313
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:21,811
- They're surrounding us.

1314
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,013
- Oh, shit.

1315
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:24,514
I can't believe I got
 us into this mess.

1316
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,982
We're gonna die in this shit
 hole in the middle of the.

1317
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:26,983
- Shh, shh, shh.

1318
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,418
They'll hear you.

1319
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:32,189
Listen, I have to go out there.

1320
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,157
- No, you're not.

1321
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,924
You won't leave me here alone.

1322
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,694
- If I don't go out
there, they'll kill us.

1323
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:38,928
- What do you mean?

1324
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:39,896
- I need your help.

1325
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:40,830
- You need my help?

1326
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,132
Oh, that's rich.

1327
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,800
You're so funny you kill me.

1328
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,303
(tense music)

1329
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,609
- I can take them out, but
 I need you to cover me.

1330
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:53,810
Can you do it?

1331
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,079
- Do I have a
 fucking choice, huh?

1332
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:56,080
I don't have a choice.

1333
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,013
Oh, excuse me.

1334
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:57,747
I forgot, we all have a choice.

1335
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,682
Not, wrong.

1336
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,217
I do not have a fucking choice.

1337
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,920
- Eva, if you run and you
 don't cover me, I'm dead.

1338
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,992
Okay?

1339
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:09,859
- Okay, Cooper.

1340
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,694
- [Lance] Okay?

1341
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:13,097
- Okay, don't worry.

1342
01:07:13,097 --> 01:07:15,599
My ass and this floor have
 a great thing going on here.

1343
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,433
Okay.

1344
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,668
Don't worry.

1345
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,070
Don't fucking worry.

1346
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,238
Don't fucking worry.

1347
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:22,906
Don't fucking worry.

1348
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,310
- [Hydra] Remember, the
woman is top priority.

1349
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,245
Take her down on sight.

1350
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:32,516
- [Man] There he is!

1351
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,018
(guns firing)

1352
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:51,401
- [Man] He's on
 the second floor.

1353
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,472
- Zimbalist is on the loose.

1354
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:56,506
We're giving chase.

1355
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:57,707
- Excellent.

1356
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,576
- Do you want me to
quarterback or move in?

1357
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,444
- Move in.

1358
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,245
Move in.

1359
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,014
- Everybody, move in.

1360
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,417
Orders are to focus on the Lucy.

1361
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,586
Report her sighting to me.

1362
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:15,825
- Okay.

1363
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,261
Fuck.

1364
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:18,262
God help me.

1365
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:32,276
(tires squealing)

1366
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:34,711
(gun firing)

1367
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:47,891
- [Agent] Sir,
 did you hear that?

1368
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,058
Sounds like gunfire.

1369
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:49,893
- Where?

1370
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,628
Where the hell are they?

1371
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,829
Turn around quick.

1372
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:53,630
It's coming from
 the other direction.

1373
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,398
Head for the factory.

1374
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:55,232
Move!

1375
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,207
(gun firing)

1376
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:15,452
- I figure the Zimbalist
is running solo now.

1377
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,822
He's trying to bleed us.

1378
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,056
- Put him down.

1379
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:22,926
- Goddamn battery bunny.

1380
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:35,839
(gun firing)

1381
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,841
(yells)

1382
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,980
- At the risk of stating
the obvious, be careful.

1383
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,814
- Okay.

1384
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:56,893
- Koff, come in.

1385
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,965
Check out the upstairs.

1386
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,470
We've got a brother
 on the second floor.

1387
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,804
Check your fire.

1388
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,209
(footsteps echoing)

1389
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,014
- Oh, mother of God.

1390
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:19,349
Please, help me.

1391
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,320
I don't want to die like this.

1392
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,822
I don't want to die like this.

1393
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,962
(guns firing)

1394
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,797
(yells)

1395
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:36,700
(glass shattering)

1396
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,271
- Shit.

1397
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,071
Cover me!

1398
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,377
(gun firing)

1399
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:54,851
(breathing rapidly)

1400
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:57,587
(dramatic music)

1401
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,225
- Hydra has encountered
the Zimbalist.

1402
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:04,260
- [Mars] That means
 Lucy is unprotected.

1403
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,094
Move in.

1404
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:11,100
(grunting)

1405
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,523
(bones crack)

1406
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,566
- Cooper, help!

1407
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:44,434
- Don't do it.

1408
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:45,902
She dies, you die.

1409
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,207
Think about it.

1410
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:00,850
- [Mars] Wait!

1411
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:07,357
I think this is what's commonly
known as a Mexican standoff.

1412
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:09,158
- Let's do it.

1413
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,594
- Not yet.

1414
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:13,229
He has a 50-50 shot at taking
 one, or both, of us out.

1415
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,063
Bad odds.

1416
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,602
- Okay, then let's bargain.

1417
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:19,603
- Good idea.

1418
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:22,706
We're all professionals.

1419
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:28,111
It's been a very exciting
 game, Agent Cooper.

1420
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:30,447
But I'm afraid we
 have a stalemate.

1421
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:33,650
We have the woman, you
 may, or may not, have us.

1422
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:36,720
There is a rational
 win-win scenario.

1423
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:40,524
We just have to flesh
 it out like grownups.

1424
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:43,126
Go easy on the testosterone.

1425
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:46,396
Don't make any sudden
 or drastic moves.

1426
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,700
- What did you have in mind?

1427
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,804
(tense music)

1428
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,540
- Okay, ground rules.

1429
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:02,245
Just so there's no crazy gambit,

1430
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:06,082
please note my associate
is completely protected

1431
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,917
by Ms. Ramirez's body.

1432
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:14,824
You cannot take her out
 without harming Ms. Ramirez.

1433
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:18,995
(muffled screaming)

1434
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,599
Have we established that?

1435
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:25,669
- We have.

1436
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:30,106
- Ground rule number two.

1437
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:33,577
We except the notion that
 a deal must be struck.

1438
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:37,013
We have to talk, not
 shoot at each other.

1439
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:41,084
So let's talk face
 to face, up close,

1440
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,889
to avoid any surprises.

1441
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:48,057
Come on out, Agent Cooper.

1442
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:16,252
Good.

1443
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:20,023
Now we're getting somewhere.

1444
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,192
- The gun, lose it.

1445
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,035
- You lose it.

1446
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:42,378
We'll get nothing accomplished
 without an act of goodwill.

1447
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,617
I'll lower my gun.

1448
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:54,490
Your turn.

1449
01:14:57,594 --> 01:14:58,728
- Shoot him.

1450
01:14:58,728 --> 01:14:59,563
Shoot him.

1451
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,069
You son of a bitch.

1452
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,071
You're gonna give
 me up, aren't you?

1453
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:10,607
You're just like the other
 fuckers, you son of a bitch.

1454
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:12,876
Cooper, you son of a bitch.

1455
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,546
- Shut up.

1456
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:17,947
- Who are you?

1457
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:21,150
- [Mars] Name are irrelevant.

1458
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,888
- I like to know who
 I'm dealing with.

1459
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:26,322
- Trenton Fraser.

1460
01:15:27,591 --> 01:15:31,494
Used to be Major Trenton
Fraser, 82nd Airborne.

1461
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:34,130
Surprised, Cooper?

1462
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:37,934
You see, we're not that
different, you and I.

1463
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:42,171
Both professionals, both
 been fucked by the system.

1464
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:45,975
Me, they retired after
 years of loyal service

1465
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:49,212
above and beyond the
call of duty, way above.

1466
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,581
And you, the way
they treated you

1467
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,549
after the death of your wife.

1468
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,450
Oh, yes.

1469
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:55,952
I know about Annie.

1470
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:58,888
And believe me, I
 know what it's like

1471
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,691
to lay your life on the
 line for the powers that be

1472
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:03,426
only to have them turn
 their backs on you

1473
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:04,928
when you really need them.

1474
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:07,096
Fuck them all, son.

1475
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:11,134
Take care of yourself,
 no one else will.

1476
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,235
Nobody cares.

1477
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,873
I feel for you, I really do.

1478
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:22,445
I'll kill you if I have
to, but I'd rather not.

1479
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:27,884
We're not going
 to kill each other

1480
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:30,386
over some mobster slut, right?

1481
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:35,091
Do you know who she
 is, Agent Cooper?

1482
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,526
Not some sweet,
 innocent housewife

1483
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:41,164
blissfully unaware of her
 scumbag husband's real job.

1484
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:44,067
She was Debenedito's right hand.

1485
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:46,469
Wifey here was
involved in everything.

1486
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:50,173
Money laundering,
 prostitution, murder.

1487
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:52,308
She's Lady fucking Macbeth.

1488
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:56,079
She's got blood on her
 dainty little hands.

1489
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:57,413
Let us have her.

1490
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:03,052
I'll make it worth your while.

1491
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,054
You'll never have
 to work another day.

1492
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:07,090
Never have to lay your
 life on the line for.

1493
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,391
- How much?

1494
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:10,559
(gasping)

1495
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,298
- Good, okay.

1496
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,901
Let's come to some figure
 just so we can define

1497
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:21,570
the nature of the rest
 of the conversation.

1498
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,873
Let's talk numbers.

1499
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:26,609
We've established consensus.

1500
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:28,544
The lady is expendable.

1501
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,848
- Like you say, she's no lady.

1502
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:32,816
- No lady.

1503
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,617
You got that right.

1504
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:37,120
Shall we say, mid six figures?

1505
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,255
- Exact numbers.

1506
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:40,089
- 500,000.

1507
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:43,760
- Not even close.

1508
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,062
- [Trenton] A cool million.

1509
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:47,263
- Two.

1510
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:48,131
- [Trenton] Too much.

1511
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:49,065
- Two.

1512
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:50,834
You have no time to haggle.

1513
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:52,736
My backup's on the way.

1514
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:55,638
- Deal.

1515
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,074
Two million.

1516
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,176
You name the bank
 and the account.

1517
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,311
I suggest Swiss, numbered.

1518
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,147
- [Lance] Fine, arrange it.

1519
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:05,614
- [Trenton] I will.

1520
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,084
You'll have the account
 information before we leave.

1521
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,919
The money will be
 wired in a few days.

1522
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,256
Then you can do
 whatever you want.

1523
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:17,894
- I can't believe I put up with
all this shit for this lady.

1524
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:20,063
Excuse me, this class act.

1525
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,233
Some class act.

1526
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,502
- [Trenton] Good
 thing you dislike her.

1527
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:29,005
Makes the deed more tolerable.

1528
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,043
- You better believe it.

1529
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:37,546
I won't lose a minute's
 sleep over this class act.

1530
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:40,817
This fucking class act.

1531
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:43,920
- [Trenton] Yes, well.

1532
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,288
I think we have
 safely established

1533
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:48,792
what she is and what
 she apparently isn't.

1534
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:52,461
- [Lance] She's not a class act.

1535
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:54,397
- Whatever.

1536
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,676
- Come on, let's
 get on with this.

1537
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,512
- Now, my associate
 will conclude our deal

1538
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:11,881
by firing one shot into
Ms. Ramirez's head.

1539
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:13,116
A clean kill.

1540
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:14,717
Let's not have any
 knee-jerk reactions.

1541
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:16,152
We're all professionals here.

1542
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:18,254
We've all seen men
 and women die before,

1543
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:23,259
so no one's going to get
 suddenly sentimental, right?

1544
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,228
Don't get blood on you.

1545
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:26,162
You don't have time
 to change clothes.

1546
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:28,731
We got straight to the airport.

1547
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:39,575
I'll count to three so no
 one acts out of impulse.

1548
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:43,612
She'll fire, then we'll
all just walk away.

1549
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,447
Okay?

1550
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,484
- Sure.

1551
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:52,221
- One.

1552
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:55,892
(tense music)

1553
01:20:00,696 --> 01:20:01,530
Two.

1554
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:08,771
- Three.
 (gun fires)

1555
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,173
(yelling)

1556
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:12,441
(guns firing)

1557
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:13,276
- Cooper!

1558
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,313
(grunts)

1559
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,417
(yelling)

1560
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:22,251
Gun.

1561
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:24,320
Got it.

1562
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,588
You go to hell!

1563
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,557
Fuck.

1564
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:29,392
Cooper.

1565
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:30,326
Cooper.

1566
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,395
Cooper, oh, my god look at you.

1567
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:33,897
Oh, God, Cooper.

1568
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:34,730
Oh, my god.

1569
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,831
Look at all this blood.

1570
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:36,933
What should I do?

1571
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,501
What should I do?

1572
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,568
- Eva.

1573
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:40,436
- Yeah, what?

1574
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:41,670
- [Lance] Listen.

1575
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,908
Outside in the vehicle,
call for help, okay?

1576
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,444
- Okay, Cooper.

1577
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:50,279
Yes, yes, Cooper.

1578
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:51,814
Cooper, listen to me.

1579
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:54,083
You know, what he said.

1580
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,085
You know what he said
is not true, don't you?

1581
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:58,821
I mean, I didn't know
 anything, really.

1582
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,856
I knew Tony was not a choir boy.

1583
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,625
I really didn't know
 what was really going on.

1584
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,692
Do you believe me, Cooper?

1585
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,593
You believe me, right?

1586
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:05,428
- I know.

1587
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:06,262
I know.

1588
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,530
Please, go.

1589
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,698
- Okay, I'm gonna
 go for help, okay?

1590
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,200
You stay here, Cooper.

1591
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,301
I'm so sorry.

1592
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:14,137
I know I talk too much, Cooper.

1593
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:15,939
It's just the way
 I am with me, okay?

1594
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:16,772
- [Lance] Okay, go.

1595
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:17,606
- [Eva] Don't go.

1596
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:18,441
I'll be right back.

1597
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:19,275
- I know.

1598
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:20,509
I know, I know.

1599
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:27,016
(coughs)

1600
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,853
(groaning)

1601
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,127
- Trent.

1602
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:40,496
Trent.

1603
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:51,240
Fuck you.

1604
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:56,079
- No, fuck you.

1605
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:06,655
(uplifting music)

1606
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:16,532
- Cooper!

1607
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:18,968
You in here, son?

1608
01:22:18,968 --> 01:22:20,303
- Sir, I'm here.

1609
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:22,038
- Hold on, Cooper.

1610
01:22:22,038 --> 01:22:24,207
We're coming in for you.

1611
01:22:24,207 --> 01:22:26,775
(fingers snap)

1612
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:32,881
Oh, my god.

1613
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,152
Hang in there, Cooper.

1614
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:38,021
It's gonna be all right.

1615
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:40,123
You got them all, did ya?

1616
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:42,158
- The woman.

1617
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:44,227
- Don't worry about it, Cooper.

1618
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:45,761
We'll take care of her now.

1619
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,496
You've done your job.

1620
01:22:51,334 --> 01:22:53,269
I've gotta say, Ms. Ramirez.

1621
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:55,371
You look a hell of a lot
 different than I expected.

1622
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:56,672
- No, you're making
 a big mistake.

1623
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:57,673
- [Crispin] That's
 what they all say.

1624
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,442
(gun fires)

1625
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:00,243
- Crispin!

1626
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:08,717
Why?

1627
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:12,821
- There's a senator
 called Ivanovitch,

1628
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,924
he got in bed with
 the mob 20 years ago.

1629
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:18,061
He needed a piece of the Bureau

1630
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:20,729
so he could keep himself secure.

1631
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,798
He found a weak link, me.

1632
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,436
Ms. Ramirez knew a
 hell of a lot more

1633
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:30,173
than she told at the
 Deadly Don trials.

1634
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,375
The director wanted her recalled

1635
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,709
so she could spill
 the whole thing

1636
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:35,678
in front of the committee.

1637
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:40,549
I had to cancel her invitation,
if you know what I mean.

1638
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:42,218
- I can't believe it.

1639
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:43,052
Not you.

1640
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:50,393
- Young men with principles
 become old men with debts.

1641
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:52,061
I wanted to let you
 in on this deal.

1642
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:53,829
Believe me, I did.

1643
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,864
But you're true blue, Cooper.

1644
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,233
(coughs)

1645
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:58,834
You're a Boy Scout.

1646
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:06,008
Look at me in the eye

1647
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:08,944
and tell me that you'll
 never talk about this again.

1648
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:11,347
If I let you live,
 if I let you go,

1649
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:14,650
that you'll never breathe
 a word of this to anyone.

1650
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,719
Promise me that.

1651
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,388
(subdued music)

1652
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:27,363
- I can't.

1653
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:30,366
- I know.

1654
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,639
- [Lance] Sir, no.

1655
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:47,383
- I can't.

1656
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:49,352
I can't kill him.

1657
01:24:49,352 --> 01:24:50,186
Damn it.

1658
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,491
You, kill him.

1659
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:58,827
And when you're done, dump
 him with the bitch's body.

1660
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,363
- [Agent] Yes, sir.

1661
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:08,704
(gun firing)

1662
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:11,640
- The bitch is
 right here, asshole!

1663
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:20,816
Cooper.

1664
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:22,651
Cooper, come on.

1665
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:24,353
Come on, let's go.

1666
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:25,188
- Coop.

1667
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:29,225
Coop, you gotta help me.

1668
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,729
You can't leave me like this.

1669
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:40,936
I'm sorry.

1670
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:43,639
Believe me, I'm sorry.

1671
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:56,285
- Cooper, now what?

1672
01:25:57,753 --> 01:25:59,188
Huh?

1673
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:02,625
- Now we go to Washington
 so you can testify.

1674
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:05,728
- And then?

1675
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,265
- And then there are choices.

1676
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,737
- Choices, huh?

1677
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:17,640
(both laugh)

1678
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,474
- Yeah.

1679
01:26:18,474 --> 01:26:19,808
- Did you just smile?

1680
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:20,643
Huh?

1681
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,211
- No, it just hurts.

1682
01:26:22,211 --> 01:26:23,712
- Yes, you did.

1683
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:27,250
I mean, unless that was like
 a toothache or something.

1684
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:31,620
Because if that's a smile,
 you should, like, you know,

1685
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:36,625
do it more often because it
 looks really good on you.

1686
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,229
You know, Cooper, I used to
 have a teacher who would say,

1687
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:44,066
smile and the whole world
 will smile with you.

1688
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:46,702
Cry, and nobody's
 gonna give a fuck.

1689
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:50,239
Well, except, of
course, if you ever cry,

1690
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,241
I give a fuck because...

1691
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:55,311
Do you think I talk too much?

1692
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:56,679
- [Lance] A little.

1693
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,114
- [Eva] Does it bother you?

1694
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:01,284
- [Lance] Not that much.

1695
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:04,119
(whimsical music)

1696
01:27:13,296 --> 01:27:15,964
(engine starts)

1697
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,409
(uptempo music)

1698
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:14,423
(dramatic music)

1699
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:06,101
(tense music)

1700
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:29,725
(subdued music)
