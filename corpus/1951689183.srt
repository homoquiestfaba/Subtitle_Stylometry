[Sighs]

184
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,126
JAMIE: It wasn't my fault!

185
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,134
Why won't you ever be
on my side?

186
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:27,795
EVE: I am always
on your side...

187
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,135
but you have to give me
a chance.

188
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,298
SEAN: Now what?

189
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,500
[Sighs]

190
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,704
She was suspended again.
Kid made fun of her clothes.

191
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:36,871
She started a fight?

192
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:39,279
JAMIE: Right, Dad,
don't even ask me what happened.

193
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,681
SEAN: OK. What happened?

194
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,518
Oh. I see.

195
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:51,117
JAMIE: Not like you would
believe me anyway.

196
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,924
Jamie, look, it's not easy, OK?

197
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:56,124
I mean, look...

198
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,429
you change the way you look
every week.

199
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,002
And the way you act?

200
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,867
Who are you supposed to be now?

201
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,634
I'm supposed to be me.

202
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,074
Not like you have a clue
who I am anyway.

203
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:12,307
[Door closes]

204
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,279
EVE: I have to work tonight.

205
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,346
I called to tell you.

206
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:23,290
I was on hold for 10 minutes,
and I couldn't wait any longer.

207
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,657
I got him, Eve.

208
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,596
It's over?

209
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,231
It's over.

210
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,599
Oh, Sean.

211
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,471
I'll make it up to
you and and Jamie, I promise.

212
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:46,777
I'll put in for a desk job...

213
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:50,217
and I'll do counseling,
sit down, talk about Mike.

214
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,015
I'll do it. Anything you want.

215
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:55,080
I just want you.

216
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,582
Well, good, 'cause
that's what you're gonna get.

217
00:19:58,627 --> 00:19:59,958
You happy?

218
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:03,022
I think so. Yes.

219
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:05,966
[Laughing]
Oh, thank God.

220
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,747
MAN: Hold on.

221
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:32,958
What is all this?

222
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:38,092
KIMBERLY:
Sir, the ClA sent this over.

223
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:42,630
SEAN: Didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

224
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:43,831
No, wait.

225
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,969
How about, uh...

226
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,142
What about to Anderson...

227
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,410
Montgomery, Berkley...

228
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,510
Pincus...Gianelli...

229
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,955
Winters.

[Sighs]

231
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:40,788
How's Loomis?

232
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,133
TITO: He's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh...

233
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,657
he'll be OK.

234
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,296
What's up?

235
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,898
Special Ops.
They want a word.

236
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,705
Aw, forget it.
I don't have the time.

237
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,734
HOLLIS: Better make time, Sean.

238
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,804
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

239
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:01,817
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

240
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:12,354
[Music plays,
woman moans with pleasure]

241
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:14,522
WOMAN: Ohh!

242
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,333
SEAN: Porcelain casing.

243
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:24,100
Thermal cloak.

244
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,904
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

245
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:29,410
HOLLIS: It's enough to flatten
a square mile.

246
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:32,278
Then, depending
on the prevailing winds...

247
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,748
the fallout will be
a tad worse...

248
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,614
than Gulf War Syndrome.

249
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:42,190
SEAN:
The biblical plague to L.A.--

250
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,624
Fuck! Aah! Where is he?

251
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,525
Where's Pollux Troy?

252
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:54,132
MAN: Why draw the schematic if
you're not gonna build the bomb?

253
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,196
POLLUX: What, is it a crime
to exercise the mind?

254
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:00,174
I won't say another word
until I see my brother.

255
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:04,138
VICTOR: Any progress?

256
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,711
I need about 10 minutes
alone with this guy.

257
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,877
You got Castor. Just go home.

258
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,216
[Sighs]

259
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:13,312
We won't evacuate the city
on your hunch.

260
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:16,449
Look, I know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

261
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:17,686
You know what?

262
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,854
Just run the goddamn bureau
any way you like.

263
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:26,961
[Sighs]

264
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:32,836
HOLLIS: I could put
an agent in his cell.

265
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,433
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

266
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:38,242
SEAN: Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

267
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,841
The only person he'd talk to
is his brother, and he's dead.

268
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:45,180
HOLLIS:
There is one other possibility.

269
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,360
[Beeping]

270
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,304
Oh, God!
You're keeping him alive.

271
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:18,181
HOLLIS: Relax, Archer.
He's a turnip.

272
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:22,583
[Sean groaning]

273
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:26,285
What if you could walk
into Erewhon prison...

274
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:29,090
and give Pollux
a nice big brotherly hug...

275
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:30,687
as Castor Troy?

276
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,433
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

277
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:38,028
MALCOLM: Let me try.
Malcolm Walsh.

278
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,629
I run the bio cover unit
for Special Ops.

279
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:42,198
-I know who you are.
-But not what I can do.

280
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,640
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

281
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,943
HOLLIS: Dr. Walsh
can alter the likeness...

282
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,279
even the voice
of a government witness.

283
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,649
MALCOLM: I think you'll
recognize this patient.

284
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:58,621
We had to build
your friend Loomis...

285
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:00,319
a whole new ear from scratch.

286
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:13,395
What we're suggesting for you
isn't a permanent transplant.

287
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,135
Just a temporary trade.

288
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,436
Come here.

289
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:24,505
With new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

290
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:27,281
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

291
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,151
Height difference is negligible.

292
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:36,192
Skin pigment, eye pigment,
both almost identical.

293
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:39,892
We'll use laser shears
for the hairline...

294
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,400
microplugs for body hair.

295
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,902
We'll do an abdominoplasty...

296
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:46,030
take care of those, uh,
love handles.

297
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,267
But all that's the easy part.

298
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:50,833
Here's the real science.

299
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:54,814
This is a state of the art
morphogenetic template.

300
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:58,614
The inside is modeled
on your skull...

301
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:02,553
The outside exactly like Troy's.
Then we fit his face on top.

302
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,887
Not a replica,
but the real thing.

303
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,391
Then we simply connect...

304
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:08,053
the muscles, tear ducts,
and nerve endings...

305
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:09,823
SEAN: So you want to take
his face and mine--

306
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:10,989
HOLLIS: Borrow.

307
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,056
The procedure's
completely reversible.

308
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:16,227
SEAN: You think
that I want to do this?

309
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:18,100
No. No!

310
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:20,106
There's no one else, Sean.

311
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,131
You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

312
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:24,735
I'll get his gang to talk.
That's what I do!

313
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:27,269
What if you can't?
The bomb will blow.

314
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:29,304
And Castor Troy will win.

315
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,411
SEAN: Get out!

316
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:35,921
Go ahead. Wipe your ass.

317
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:38,515
TITO: Damn!
What the hell is that smell?

318
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:40,583
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

319
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,428
SEAN: Hello, Sasha.

320
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:46,899
When was the last time
you saw Castor Troy?

321
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:49,663
-Who cares? He's dead.
-Answer the question.

322
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:52,432
I know my rights.
I don't have to answer shit.

323
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:53,803
You're right, but know this.

324
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,307
You're a convicted felon...

325
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:57,809
on probation
for harboring Castor Troy.

326
00:26:57,844 --> 00:26:59,539
One phone call from me...

327
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,740
and your son will end up
in a foster home.

328
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,377
I understand why you would use
such a threat...

329
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,390
but you try to take him
away from me...

330
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:12,891
I swear to you...

331
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:19,723
I haven't seen him for years.

332
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:25,631
[Sighs]

333
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:36,915
SEAN: This reeks of you.

334
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,009
It's got your signature
all over it.

335
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:44,318
DIETRICH: Maybe, but you
ain't got nothin' on me...

336
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,824
and you know it.

337
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:49,818
Maybe so, but I can keep you
within city limits...

338
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:51,353
or I can talk
to your sister again.

339
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:53,558
She's right outside.

340
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:57,996
Only this time I'll be nice.

341
00:27:59,038 --> 00:27:59,970
Hey, Sean...

342
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:02,901
how's your dead son?

343
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:09,582
Aah!

344
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,617
I don't know any--

345
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:17,487
OK. Something about the 18th,
but that's all I know.

346
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:30,301
TITO: Great. So we got a date.
Where the hell's the damn bomb?

347
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,133
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

348
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,969
It's your call, Sean.

349
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,771
SEAN:
Does Lazarro know your plan?

350
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,107
HOLLIS: No.
This is a black bag operation.

351
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:41,079
Strictly off the books.

352
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:44,379
You can't tell Lazarro,
and you can't tell your wife.

353
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:49,114
Oh, God.

354
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:51,123
What are you asking me to do?

355
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:52,624
OK, let's see.

356
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:56,720
You're asking me
to break the law...

357

CASTOR: Get some backup.

1253
01:45:52,885 --> 01:45:55,012
What a day.

1254
01:45:59,325 --> 01:46:00,815
You look tense.

1255
01:46:06,065 --> 01:46:10,900
CASTOR: I know I've been acting
different lately, strange.

1256
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:15,038
But I've got a confession
to make, Eve.

1257
01:46:15,074 --> 01:46:17,167
You're not gonna like it.

1258
01:46:19,245 --> 01:46:22,806
Oh, Eve, I feel...
I feel so close to you.

1259
01:46:22,849 --> 01:46:25,044
I read your diary.

1260
01:46:25,084 --> 01:46:27,279
I know I shouldn't have.
I'm ashamed.

1261
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,049
But I did.

1262
01:46:29,088 --> 01:46:32,455
I just want to be the man
that you deserve--

1263
01:46:32,491 --> 01:46:34,322
passionate, attentive.

1264
01:46:39,098 --> 01:46:42,556
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.

1265
01:46:42,602 --> 01:46:46,129
My mentor--gone.

1266
01:46:46,172 --> 01:46:49,972
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?

1267
01:46:52,612 --> 01:46:55,080
I hope this doesn't mean
I'm losing you.

1268
01:46:55,114 --> 01:46:56,638
EVE: Of course not.

1269
01:47:05,057 --> 01:47:07,548
You're the only family I've got.

1270
01:47:58,374 --> 01:48:00,103
Oh, God.

1271
01:48:01,544 --> 01:48:02,704
Oh, Sean.

1272
01:48:04,046 --> 01:48:05,343
Oh, God.

1273
01:48:05,381 --> 01:48:08,976
SEAN: I was hoping
you'd come here.

1274
01:48:09,018 --> 01:48:10,815
Thank you for trusting me.

1275
01:48:14,857 --> 01:48:16,518
EVE: Right now...

1276
01:48:16,559 --> 01:48:18,993
I don't trust anyone.

1277
01:48:19,028 --> 01:48:22,191
SEAN:
Eve, where'd you get that gun?

1278
01:48:22,231 --> 01:48:25,530
EVE: I took it
from my fake husband.

1279
01:48:25,568 --> 01:48:28,469
SEAN: Put it down.
You know I'm Sean.

1280
01:48:28,504 --> 01:48:31,473
EVE: Do l?
Maybe Sean's already dead.

1281
01:48:31,507 --> 01:48:34,738
SEAN: I'm moving very slowly.

1282
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,398
I was thinking the other day...

1283
01:49:01,737 --> 01:49:03,500
I remember...

1284
01:49:03,539 --> 01:49:08,602
I once took a date out
for surf and turf...

1285
01:49:08,644 --> 01:49:11,545
not knowing
she was a vegetarian.

1286
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:17,512
So she ate bread...

1287
01:49:17,553 --> 01:49:21,353
and, uh, broke her tooth
on a rye seed.

1288
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,018
And we drove around
all night...

1289
01:49:28,064 --> 01:49:32,023
Iooking
for an all-night dentist...

1290
01:49:32,068 --> 01:49:37,734
and he was so drunk,
he fixed the wrong tooth.

1292
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:48,573
And when I finally
brought her home...

1293
01:49:51,087 --> 01:49:55,080
even though
it must've hurt like hell...

1294
01:49:57,093 --> 01:49:59,687
you kissed me.

1295
01:50:05,167 --> 01:50:06,395

EVE: That man, he...

1298
01:50:19,048 --> 01:50:23,508
We've been living together
as man and wife for a week.

1299
01:50:23,552 --> 01:50:27,352

Eve...

1302
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,526
I put you in that position...

1303
01:50:33,562 --> 01:50:36,998
and I can never
make it up to you.

1304
01:50:42,571 --> 01:50:45,131
You're damn well gonna try.

1305
01:50:45,174 --> 01:50:49,508
Let me look at that wound
before you bleed to death.

1306
01:50:57,052 --> 01:50:59,043
SEAN: With Lazarro gone...

1307
01:50:59,088 --> 01:51:01,886
Castor's the new acting director
of the bureau.

1308
01:51:01,924 --> 01:51:03,050

1310
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,791

at Victor's service.

SEAN: Tomorrow.

1312

1313
01:51:17,373 --> 01:51:19,534
I want you and Jamie
away from there.

1314
01:51:19,575 --> 01:51:20,701
Give him a good excuse.

1315
01:51:20,743 --> 01:51:23,177
I can cover for Jamie,
but if I'm not coming...

1316
01:51:23,212 --> 01:51:24,975
he'll know something's up.

1317
01:51:26,348 --> 01:51:29,545
Besides, I'm the only one who
can try and explain the truth.

sorry, darling.

1322

what is a guy to think...

1323

in the middle of the night?

EVE: That I'm a doctor
that's on call.

1325
01:52:10,025 --> 01:52:11,356
So please let me
get back to work, OK?

CASTOR: Sorry.

1327

CASTOR: Lies, distrust,

1328
01:52:20,436 --> 01:52:22,870

into a real marriage.

1330

CASTOR: Where's Jamie?

1333

EVE: That's what I'm wondering.

1334
01:52:53,302 --> 01:52:56,362
She stole $50
from my purse and took off.

1335
01:52:58,574 --> 01:53:00,098
SASHA: So what's the next move?

1336
01:53:00,142 --> 01:53:02,303

Our daughter won't even
visit Michael's grave.

1339

about your boss?

CASTOR: Dad, put the gun down.

1429
02:02:13,392 --> 02:02:15,485
Put it down.

1430
02:02:15,528 --> 02:02:18,691
Dad...put it down.

1431
02:02:18,731 --> 02:02:22,724
Now we're gonna find out
what's in papa's bag...

1432
02:02:22,768 --> 02:02:24,235
Peaches.

1433
02:02:29,375 --> 02:02:30,899
Say good-bye to papa.

1434
02:02:30,943 --> 02:02:33,673
Aaahhh!

1435
02:02:33,712 --> 02:02:35,475
Jamie!

1436
02:02:39,051 --> 02:02:41,679
[Siren]

1437
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:44,382
EVE: Jamie!

1438
02:02:44,423 --> 02:02:46,391
EVE: Are you all right? God!

1439
02:02:47,526 --> 02:02:48,823
Sir, are you OK?

1440
02:02:52,531 --> 02:02:54,692
[Siren]

1441
02:02:58,537 --> 02:03:01,802
JAMIE: Will someone please
tell me what planet I'm on?

1442
02:03:16,388 --> 02:03:18,083
SEAN: Get down! Move!

1443
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:55,492
[Ship's horn honks]

1444
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:34,697
Stop! This is the police!

1445
02:04:34,733 --> 02:04:37,668
Stop immediately or we will be
forced to open fire.

1446
02:04:39,004 --> 02:04:40,767
Fire! Fire!

1447
02:06:00,419 --> 02:06:02,011
SEAN: Oh, shit.

1448
02:08:29,899 --> 02:08:31,059
Aah!

1449
02:08:34,204 --> 02:08:36,001
Aah!

1450
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:55,187
Aah!

1451
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:10,405
CASTOR: You're right, Sean.

1452
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,533
I've misbehaved.

1453
02:09:12,575 --> 02:09:13,803
I need to be punished.

1454
02:09:19,382 --> 02:09:23,580
But remember, every time
you look in the mirror...

1455
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:25,918
you'll see my face.

1456
02:09:36,766 --> 02:09:38,165
Aah!

1457
02:09:42,972 --> 02:09:45,304
Die!

1458
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:05,452
CASTOR: [Singing] Ready...

1459
02:10:05,495 --> 02:10:09,363
Ready for the big ride...

1460
02:10:09,399 --> 02:10:11,196
Baby.

1461
02:10:11,234 --> 02:10:12,826
[Sirens]

1462
02:10:26,483 --> 02:10:28,144
BUZZ: You OK, Archer?

1463
02:10:32,856 --> 02:10:34,949
What did you call me?

1464
02:10:34,991 --> 02:10:36,652
He called you Archer, sir.

1465
02:10:50,473 --> 02:10:51,940
EVE: Sean.

1466
02:10:51,975 --> 02:10:54,569
They're bringing in their top
surgical team from D.C.

1467
02:10:54,611 --> 02:10:55,942
You're going to be OK.

1468
02:11:26,776 --> 02:11:28,710
[Siren]

1469
02:11:41,791 --> 02:11:45,989
DOCTOR: When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

1470
02:11:46,029 --> 02:11:47,291
just the way it was.

1471
02:11:49,399 --> 02:11:51,094
My scar.

1472
02:11:52,368 --> 02:11:54,666
The one near my heart?

1473
02:11:54,704 --> 02:11:57,070
This old bullet wound...

1474
02:11:57,106 --> 02:11:59,768
I won't need it anymore.

1475
02:11:59,809 --> 02:12:01,003
DOCTOR: OK.

1476
02:12:59,235 --> 02:13:00,532
Dad?

1477
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:15,843
Dad?

1478
02:13:17,286 --> 02:13:19,049
I'm sorry I shot you.

1479
02:13:27,864 --> 02:13:30,526
I've got something
to ask both of you.

1480
02:13:42,078 --> 02:13:44,672
This is Adam.

1481
02:13:45,748 --> 02:13:47,875
And he needs a place to live.

1482
02:13:50,119 --> 02:13:51,381
JAMIE: Hi.

1483
02:13:51,421 --> 02:13:53,389
My name's Jamie.

1484
02:13:54,691 --> 02:13:56,386
I'm Adam.

1485
02:13:58,161 --> 02:14:00,595
SEAN: Why don't you show Adam
his new room?

1486
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:02,154
JAMIE: Come on.

1487
02:14:04,233 --> 02:14:06,064
EVE: OK.

1488
02:15:01,287 --> 02:15:02,777
INXS: [Singing]
You shot your mouth off...

1489
02:15:02,822 --> 02:15:05,757
Iike a kid who's scared
to have a heart.

1490
02:15:05,792 --> 02:15:07,783
Losing grip
of what really matters...

1491
02:15:07,827 --> 02:15:09,886
'cause you don't know
where to start.

1492
02:15:09,929 --> 02:15:11,829
You wake up in the morning...

1493
02:15:11,864 --> 02:15:13,957
with a starfuck for a friend.

1494
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,059
The things you do
are so in tune...

1495
02:15:16,102 --> 02:15:18,229
with what you're gonna hate.

1496
02:15:18,271 --> 02:15:20,432
What's giving you
the will to live?

1497
02:15:20,473 --> 02:15:22,236
Is it looking for revenge?

1498
02:15:22,275 --> 02:15:24,607
The only life
that you've got left...

1499
02:15:24,644 --> 02:15:26,578
is hiding from the pain.

1500
02:15:26,612 --> 02:15:28,807
What must have happened
to your soul...

1501
02:15:28,848 --> 02:15:30,645
is skinning you alive.

1502
02:15:30,683 --> 02:15:32,947
The thing
you fear the most is love...

1503
02:15:32,985 --> 02:15:38,218
and that's buried deep inside.

1504
02:15:38,257 --> 02:15:39,656
Yeah.

1505
02:15:39,692 --> 02:15:42,752
So deep inside.

1506
02:15:42,795 --> 02:15:47,061
Don't lose your head.

1507
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:50,934
'Cause I can't do the time.

1508
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:55,464
Don't lose your head.

1509
02:15:55,508 --> 02:15:59,638
Or can you pay the price?

1510
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:02,147
The heart you're building
out of rock...

1511
02:16:02,181 --> 02:16:04,115
is turning into sand.

1512
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:06,345
'Cause you never
took the time to think...

1513
02:16:06,385 --> 02:16:08,012
what it means to be a man.

1514
02:16:08,054 --> 02:16:10,181
You act like you got
the answer...

1515
02:16:10,223 --> 02:16:12,316
when the question's
never asked.

1516
02:16:12,358 --> 02:16:14,588
I've been to where
you're coming from...

1517
02:16:14,627 --> 02:16:16,618
but the postcards
weren't so bad.

1518
02:16:16,662 --> 02:16:18,721
The knife I carry's
been sharpened...

1519
02:16:18,764 --> 02:16:20,755
on the mouths
that won't keep shut.

1520
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,768
I'll stab at you
in the darkness...

1521
02:16:22,802 --> 02:16:25,032
'cause I'm trying
to shed some light.

1522
02:16:25,071 --> 02:16:26,936
Your point of view's
so meaningless...

1523
02:16:26,973 --> 02:16:29,168
if you ever had one at all.

1524
02:16:29,208 --> 02:16:35,113
All you seem to care about
is who's gonna take the fall.

1525
02:16:36,282 --> 02:16:39,581
Who's gonna take
the fall for you?

1526
02:16:41,287 --> 02:16:45,087
Don't lose your head.

1527
02:16:45,124 --> 02:16:49,151
I can't do the time for you.

1528
02:16:49,729 --> 02:16:54,189
Don't lose your head.

1529
02:16:54,233 --> 02:16:57,600
Can you pay the price?

1530
02:17:22,695 --> 02:17:24,128
Yeah.

1531
02:17:24,931 --> 02:17:26,421
Mama.

1532
02:17:31,304 --> 02:17:35,331
Don't lose your head.

1533
02:17:35,374 --> 02:17:39,708
'Cause I can't do the time.

1534
02:17:39,745 --> 02:17:44,182
Don't lose your head.

1535
02:17:44,217 --> 02:17:47,914
Can you pay the price?

1536
02:17:47,954 --> 02:17:52,550
Don't lose your head.

1537
02:17:52,592 --> 02:17:55,459
'Cause I can't do the time.

1538
02:17:56,629 --> 02:18:00,463
Don't lose your head.

1539
02:18:00,499 --> 02:18:04,595
Can you pay the price?

1540
02:18:04,637 --> 02:18:09,165
Don't lose your head.

1541
02:18:09,208 --> 02:18:11,938
You can't do the time.

1542
02:18:13,012 --> 02:18:17,813
No, don't lose your head.

1543
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:23,482
You cannot pay the price.

1544
02:18:23,522 --> 02:18:30,086
If you can't pay the price.

1545
02:18:30,129 --> 02:18:33,929
Don't lose your head.

1546
02:18:33,966 --> 02:18:37,231
You know I can't do the time.

1547
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:40,205
You ain't worth it to me.

1548
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:43,731
You ain't worth it to me.
