1
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:36,114
911.
What's your emergency?

2
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,151
H-Help.

3
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,987
There's...
accident...

4
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,655
I can't hear you.

5
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,456
What's your location?

6
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,991
There's been an accident.

7
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,126
Please come now.

8
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,762
What is the nature
of your emergency?

9
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,934
Hello? Are you still
on the line, sir?

10
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,287
No. Kind of ate way
too much at dinner.

11
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,988
Oh, okay.

12
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,223
Very special.

13
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,458
Just a little.
All right.

14
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,132
I'd like
to propose a toast.

15
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,502
To Christine on her
high school graduation

16
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,905
and her admission
to Oregon University.

17
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,874
Cheers.

18
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,314
Our little girl's
growing up.

19
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,482
I love you guys.

20
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,353
Oh, a little something
from your mom and me.

21
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,522
Is this
what I think it is?

22
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,790
I don't know.

23
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,126
It's exactly
what I wanted!

24
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,162
I think that's
enough wine for you,

25
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,263
graduation girl.

26
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,599
Thank you, guys.

27
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,239
Um, well, since
we're all in such

28
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,307
a great mood,

29
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,110
I thought it would
be a good time for us

30
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,312
to talk about something
that means a lot

31
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,513
to Christine and I.

32
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,185
Um, as you guys know,
I love her so much,

33
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,687
and... and we really feel

34
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,756
like now is...
is the right opportunity

35
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,825
for us to start
our family together,

36
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:05,597
and we really want
your blessing for that.

37
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,801
I think it's important
for a young woman

38
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,602
like Christine

39
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,204
to finish
her education

40
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,805
before taking
a serious step

41
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,740
like marriage.

42
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,907
Mom, please.

43
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,043
I want Christine
to have her independence.

44
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,912
James, I can't
think of anybody

45
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,148
I'd rather have
in the family than you,

46
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,884
but Ellen's
probably right.

47
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,719
You both should wait.

48
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,758
I completely
respect your guys'

49
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,859
point of view,

50
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,461
um, but I
feel that...

51
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,263
that I've
been on my own since

52
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,464
I was 15 years old,

53
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,600
and I have a great job
at the mill,

54
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,870
and I know I can provide
in every way possible.

55
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:45,971
James...

56
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,541
life is far more difficult
than you realize.

57
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,845
To this day, Doug wishes
that he had completed

58
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:54,946
a proper education.

59
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,218
Look, I know
that I didn't complete

60
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,320
the proper education...

61
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,023
It was my education
that allowed me

62
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,892
to launch
a very prosperous

63
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,226
publishing company.

64
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,228
James, I understand
your perspective.

65
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,364
I do. I get it,
but Ellen's right.

66
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,801
You're both too young.
Wait.

67
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,775
That doesn't sound good.

68
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,780
I would like
to get home before

69
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,748
this gets worse.

70
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,917
James, buddy,
would you mind being

71
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,318
the designated driver?

72
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,220
I think you're
the only sober one

73
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,222
at this table.

74
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,059
Yeah, sure, Mr. Webb.
That's fine.

75
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,998
"So foul and fair a day
I have not seen."

76
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,468
"Macbeth."

77
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,479
James, look,
I'm sorry, okay?

78
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,315
I had no idea they were
gonna react that way.

79
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,484
Yeah, well, I kind of
expected you to chime in

80
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,719
instead of just letting your
mom tear me a new one.

81
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,654
I mean, we talked about
what we were gonna say.

82
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,523
Okay, but you did an amazing
job in there, okay?

83
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,659
I'm... I didn't have any idea that
it was gonna happen that way.

84
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,928
Yeah, well...
I'll talk to her.

85
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,664
Well, your parents are
never gonna respect me,

86
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,666
'cause I didn't get
a precious college

87
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,168
education like you did.

88
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,771
That's not fair, James.

89
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,707
Well, I know you're
just gonna go and find

90
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,276
some trust-fund frat boy
and leave me, so...

91
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,044
Is that what
you really think?

92
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:38,383
James, you're the man
that I want to marry.

93
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,152
I love you.
I would never do that.

94
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,421
Okay. I'm sorry.

95
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,223
I'm sorry, too.

96
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,030
I love you.

97
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,032
I love you.

98
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,604
Christine, let's go!

99
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,039
Watch your step now.

100
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,715
Drive safe.

101
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,715
Look at our sleeping
beauty up there.

102
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,284
Doug, don't break
her present before she

103
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,019
gets a chance to use it.

104
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,088
Will you relax?

105
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,623
When it rains this hard,

106
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,092
it usually only lasts
a few minutes.

107
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,431
I'm sick
of your comments

108
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,566
about my lack
of education in front

109
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,701
of our daughter.

110
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,636
I don't like your tone.

111
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,404
My tone?

112
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,839
Yes,
your condescending tone.

113
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,576
You started it.
You sound like a child.

114
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,812
Then stop treating me
like a child.

115
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,814
James!

116
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,315
James, there's a train!

117
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,267
We don't know
if there's any more

118
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,202
brain damage.

119
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,071
She has a small blood clot...

120
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,406
...in her brain,

121
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,908
so we have to keep
a close eye on her.

122
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,512
Dr. David,
please stop

123
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,948
in the west wing
patient lobby, Dr. David.

124
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,349
Hi.

125
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,152
Hey, Christine.

126
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,620
It's me. It's Bill.

127
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,190
Susan's here, too.

128
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,159
Hello, sweetheart.

129
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,197
Honey, you've been in a very
serious accident.

130
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,671
Where's everyone else?

131
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,206
James is
right down the hall.

132
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,776
He's doing real good.

133
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,380
What about Mom and Dad?

134
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:29,454
Bill, what about
Mom and Dad?

135
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,794
Bill, what happened?

136
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,931
No.

137
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,232
No.

138
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,304
No. No.

139
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,857
Oh, my God!

140
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,291
I'm so sorry, Dave. I...

141
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,659
Be careful in there.

142
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,928
I just mopped
the shower area.

143
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,532
Okay.
I'll just be a minute.

144
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,336
Get a move on, girl.

145
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,404
I got places to go.

146
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,572
Pervert.

147
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,549
Dave, where the fuck
are my clothes?!

148
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,569
James, pick up your phone.

149
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,406
Come on. Come on!

150
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,342
Oh, my God.

151
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,033
What?

152
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,301
No.

153
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,942
Christine.

154
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,678
No! No.

155
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,281
Fuck.

156
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,429
Hi, honey.
Hi.

157
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,531
Anything from
the state lottery?

158
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,765
No, no such luck.

159
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,000
Rats.

160
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,335
Oh, Christine got
a letter today, though,

161
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,937
from the Office
of Student Housing.

162
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,105
Huh.

163
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,706
Looks like a dorm
probably opened up.

164
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,910
Sounds like you're
trying to get rid of her.

165
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,078
No.

166
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,979
I just thought
you should know.

167
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,514
Do you want anything?

168
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,391
Baby, what happened?

169
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,359
What are you doing here?
Oh, my God.

170
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,128
How did you get here?
You were there!

171
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,129
I mean,
I don't understand!

172
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,330
What are you
talking about?

173
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,332
At the pool!

174
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,333
The pool?

175
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,834
I... I heard your
cellphone ring there.

176
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,469
My cellphone?
I told you yesterday

177
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,504
it got stolen
at the mill, remember?

178
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,506
I put it on the table,
and somebody took it.

179
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,041
I don't know
what happened to it.

180
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,476
Okay, okay.
Calm down, okay?

181
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,276
Take a breath.

182
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,511
I am breathing, okay?

183
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,279
Okay, well...
You don't understand, okay?

184
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,482
My clothes were stolen,
and I tried to call you

185
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,284
to get you to help me, a-and
your cellphone rang there.

186
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,953
And then somebody knocked me
in the pool, and then they

187
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,920
chased me to the car!

188
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,055
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

189
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,389
How'd you get
in here, asshole?

190
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,091
Bill, just, please,
it's my fault, okay?

191
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,192
I'll explain later.

192
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,393
Yeah, thanks
for the backup, Bill.

193
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,795
I got this one
under control.

194
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,164
Bill, please.
Guys, stop.

195
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,634
Just please leave.

196
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,770
Dickhead.

197
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,507
Sweetie...

198
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,575
I didn't mean
to scare you.

199
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,577
I know.
I'm glad you're here.

200
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,413
I just wasn't expecting you,
that's all.

201
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,348
Hey...

202
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,650
It doesn't make sense.

203
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,222
Who do you think did it?

204
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,024
I don't know.

205
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,826
I don't really
want to talk about it

206
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,994
anymore, though, okay?

207
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,695
Okay, that's fine.

208
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,863
I just want
to go to sleep.

209
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,265
All right.

210
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,502
Sorry.

211
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,204
It's all right.

212
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,908
Okay, night.

213
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,681
What are you doing?

214
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,551
Nothing.

215
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,920
Thought you
were going out.

216
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,722
Yeah.

217
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,692
I am.

218
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,102
Here you go.
How's that?

219
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,104
Thank you.

220
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,105
Of course.

221
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,473
It's good to see you.

222
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:20,645
So, Mr. Anderson,
how's Ryan doing?

223
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,950
As you know, he's still
at the university

224
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,351
studying
English literature,

225
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,819
and, uh, he's getting
pretty good grades,

226
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,088
but he still doesn't
have a social life,

227
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,024
and he spends
most of his time just

228
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,325
locked up in his room.

229
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,727
Have there been
any improvements

230
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,962
in his behavior?

231
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,398
No.

232
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
In fact,
it's getting worse.

233
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,770
Worse in... in what way?

234
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,039
The violent behavior.

235
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,110
Dr. Webb,
I'm getting concerned

236
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,313
for the safety
of my daughter.

237
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,682
So based on
your sessions with him,

238
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,184
what's...
what's wrong with him?

239
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,320
Well...

240
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,589
Ryan is suffering
from extreme bouts

241
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,691
of frustration

242
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:10,161
that are accompanied
by a very distorted

243
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,862
sense of reality.

244
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,432
Uh, during these episodes,

245
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:18,102
he is unable to distinguish
real from unreal.

246
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:24,075
In other words, your son
has delusional paranoia.

247
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,146
Dr. Webb, before we
go any further,

248
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,849
there's some things
you need to know.

249
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,389
Well, the truth is
my wife disappeared

250
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,891
under what they
called suspicious

251
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,059
circumstances,

252
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,228
and to this day,
no one knows what

253
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,796
really happened to her.

254
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,466
What was their relationship
at the time?

255
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,707
You're sick!
You need help!

256
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,175
There's nothing
wrong with me!

257
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,244
Stop it, Ryan!
Leave me alone!

258
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,113
Stop it!
Let go of me!

259
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,148
Ryan,
you're hurting me!

260
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,025
Ryan,
unlock the door!

261
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,894
I'm okay, Dad.

262
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,229
Damn it,
you open this door

263
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,263
right now!

264
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,532
Dad, I'm okay.
It was a nightmare.

265
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,137
Ryan, listen to me,
buddy.

266
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:29,306
Just listen
to me, please.

267
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,142
You can't
do this anymore.

268
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,144
Now I want you
to unlock the door,

269
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,112
and I want you
to let me in.

270
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,948
Dad, go back to bed.

271
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,987
Ryan, talk to me.

272
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,489
Go back to fucking bed!

273
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,971
I can't peek?

274
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,407
No peeking.
None of that.

275
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,409
Okay, don't trip.
Don't trip. Whoa.

276
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,811
Whoa what?
I'll tell you.

277
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,779
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

278
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,301
Ready?
Okay.

279
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,320
Check it out.

280
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,055
What do you think,
huh?

281
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,590
Whose is this?

282
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,359
This is the bedroom
right here, okay?

283
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,461
Okay.

284
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:28,365
And we got campus
two blocks away,

285
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:31,368
and we got plenty
of time to furnish it,

286
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,805
and when we're married,
you can move in.

287
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,973
It's amazing.

288
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:36,941
Yeah?
Yeah.

289
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,809
You like it?
Mm-hmm.

290
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,244
Thank you.

291
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,797
I can't wait
to marry you.

292
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,305
This has been
the most amazing day ever.

293
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,707
Well, I got you,
didn't I?

294
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,175
I wasn't expecting it.

295
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,079
James, what
would you do

296
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,881
if you lost me?

297
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,849
What?

298
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,418
Could you ever
fall in love

299
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,620
with someone else?

300
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,524
I don't think I could,
and I need to know

301
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,892
that you feel the same.

302
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,594
How could you
even ask me that?

303
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,130
I proposed to you,
didn't I?

304
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,932
I know.

305
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,535
I love you.

306
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,769
I love you.

307
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,109
Do I get to pick
my fiancée up for dinner

308
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,176
tomorrow night?

309
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,578
No. I want
to cook for us

310
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,146
tomorrow night, okay?

311
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,382
Okay. I get off
at, like, 5:00.

312
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,350
Okay. Just
come over after.

313
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:54,952
All right.
Okay.

314
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,950
Christine.

315
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,220
Give me the ring.

316
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,990
Give me
the fucking ring!

317
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,360
Oh, my God.

318
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,029
Open the door!
Open the door!

319
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,231
Bill! Open the door!

320
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,933
Open the...
Oh, my God.

321
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,385
You're wide awake.

322
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,787
What are
you thinking?

323
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,691
Just wondering
who'd stalk my sister.

324
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:11,228
Are you sure that's
what's happened?

325
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,397
What does that mean?

326
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,300
Ever since the accident,

327
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,435
she's been
displaying signs of

328
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,270
post-traumatic stress.

329
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,574
I really think
she needs help from

330
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,842
a professional, honey.

331
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,610
I really think
she's a strong girl,

332
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,579
and she just needs
our support.

333
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:31,115
She has our support.
I...

334
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,919
I just wish
you'd think about it.

335
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,621
Yeah, sure.

336
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,757
Thank you.

337
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,296
You know
what tonight is?

338
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,736
It's a prime night.

339
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,938
You want to try?

340
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,909
Um, sure.

341
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,735
James.

342
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,937
Babe, what are
you doing here?

343
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,773
Sweetie, it's dangerous
for you to be here.

344
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,843
I told you that. You're not
supposed to come here.

345
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:08,278
Please don't be
mad at me, okay?

346
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,748
What is it?

347
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,884
James,
my ring was stolen.

348
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,856
W-When?

349
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,391
Last night
after you left,

350
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,260
someone came
after me again.

351
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,529
Why didn't you tell me?

352
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:26,864
Who was it?

353
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,198
Was it the guy
from the pool?

354
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,067
I can't tell you, James.
I can't tell you,

355
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,702
'cause you're gonna think
that I'm crazy, okay?

356
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:33,270
Baby, no, I'm not.

357
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,705
I'm not.

358
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:36,140
What is it?

359
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,614
James, I saw my father.

360
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,716
My father was there, okay?

361
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,786
He's the one who took
the ring from me.

362
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,823
I don't understand.

363
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,541
So be honest.

364
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,543
Do you think
I'm going crazy?

365
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:15,112
Sweetie,
you're not crazy.

366
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,182
What the hell?

367
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,554
I'm on it!

368
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,672
James!

369
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:16,707
James!

370
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,275
Help me! James!

371
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,577
Could somebody just
fucking help me!

372
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,579
Wait. What...
Somebody!

373
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,780
What's going on?

374
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:24,782
I saw him again!
What's...

375
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,016
I saw him!
He was in here!

376
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,551
He was in here!
Who was in here?

377
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,952
Is there somebody
in this house?

378
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,454
Is there somebody
in my house?!

379
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,422
Yes!

380
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,590
I saw him.

381
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,930
James, come with me.

382
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,244
Okay, Ed. Yeah, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

383
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,114
What did he say,
honey?

384
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,850
Said he's gonna
keep an eye on her

385
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,085
till we figure out
what's going on.

386
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,254
I don't know
what's going on.

387
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,356
We checked the place
up and down.

388
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,392
I couldn't find
a handprint, footprint,

389
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,027
broken lock, nothing.

390
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,164
Honey, this is
the third episode

391
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,600
without any evidence
of an actual threat.

392
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,969
Meaning what?

393
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,871
Well, you know
hallucinations

394
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:23,774
are a sure sign
to a psychotic break.

395
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,642
Psychotic break?
Listen to you.

396
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,710
What?

397
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,478
She's not making
this shit up.

398
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,247
I'm not saying she is.

399
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,849
Why does this have
to be about Christine?

400
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,417
It was dark. Anyone could
have been there.

401
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,085
Where was James when
the lights went out?

402
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,286
You're taking this
the wrong way.

403
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,921
You know, I gotta
be honest with you.

404
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,856
I think you're
jealous of her.

405
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:43,760
You think...
I'm jealous of Christine?

406
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,330
Why would I be jealous
of Christine?

407
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,298
Because she's
getting married,

408
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
gonna have a family
of her own,

409
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,302
and apparently
that's something

410
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,403
that we're having
a hard time doing.

411
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,440
Fuck you, Bill!

412
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,375
Fuck you!

413
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,011
Fuck you.

414
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,602
By the pricking
of my thumbs,

415
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:30,040
something wicked
this way comes.

416
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,792
You destroyed our family.

417
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,428
How dare you disobey me?

418
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,596
You're a disgrace.

419
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,032
Lying whore.

420
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,434
Susan!

421
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:31,535
Susan!

422
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,839
My gun is missing!

423
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,874
Okay, I'm sorry
about last night,

424
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,910
but did you
take my gun?

425
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,745
Yeah.

426
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,914
I was planning
on shooting you

427
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,016
in your sleep
last night.

428
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,951
This is not funny.
This is serious.

429
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,153
I can be suspended
for a lost firearm.

430
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:54,124
Okay, look,
I didn't take the gun.

431
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,659
It's probably
around the house.

432
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,094
I'm telling you
I've looked everywhere!

433
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,929
It is not here!

434
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,665
Okay, last night,
when the lights went out,

435
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,632
where was it?

436
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,268
I know where it was.

437
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,141
Prick.

438
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,512
Campus security.
Ed Young's office.

439
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,581
I'm sorry, Mr. Webb.
He's in a meeting

440
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,484
So then I got out
of the pool, and...

441
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,086
Mm-hmm. Watch this.

442
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,888
Never turns toward
the security cameras.

443
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,089
Never shows his face.

444
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,358
This is somebody
who knows the building,

445
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,727
knows the setup,
where the cameras are.

446
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,829
Is there any way
to enhance this?

447
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,097
No. It's too dark.

448
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,632
But don't worry about it.

449
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,767
We turned it over
to local law enforcement.

450
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,569
They're better equipped
to handle this stuff.

451
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,471
Yeah. Thanks.

452
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,306
I appreciate it.

453
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,209
You'll be hearing
from a detective

454
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,078
later this week,
okay?

455
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,640
Bye.
Bye.

456
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,862
Hey, Bill. It's Ed.

457
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,063
Oh, hey, Ed.

458
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,632
Did you get a chance
to talk to Christine?

459
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,267
Yeah. She just left.
Could you I.D. anyone?

460
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,768
Nah, but I
know who it is.

461
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,570
Tell me
it's James Campbell,

462
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,172
'cause I need a reason
to put a bullet

463
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:16,106
in that kid's head.

464
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,240
Who?
Her boyfriend.

465
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,942
I heard them arguing
after the attack.

466
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:19,843
She can place
his cellphone

467
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,011
at the scene that night.

468
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,345
She never mentioned that.
She's in denial.

469
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,647
That's interesting,

470
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:26,917
'cause I got
two hooded suspects on tape.

471
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,119
What?

472
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:32,189
I'm thinking both of our boys
were at the pool

473
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,590
the other night.

474
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,393
Call you back. I gotta go.

475
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,762
Okay, Ed. Thanks a lot.

476
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,431
Everything okay?

477
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,767
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.

478
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,269
So how long
is your shift?

479
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,805
My shift, Donna?

480
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,907
My shift lasts all night.

481
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,042
Oh.

482
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,944
See about that, huh?

483
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,719
Johnson!

484
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,721
Dave Johnson!

485
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,724
Hey. Unh!

486
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,981
Johnson!

487
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,453
Johnson!

488
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,155
Aah!

489
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,628
Hey, sweetheart.

490
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,097
Hi.

491
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,366
You want to talk?

492
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,501
Sure.

493
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,515
I miss them so much.

494
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,319
Sometimes I want
to wake up,

495
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,388
and it'd all
just be a bad dream.

496
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,228
Life can be
so cruel sometimes.

497
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,364
Yeah.

498
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,632
What's that?

499
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,403
Pictures
from my graduation.

500
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,673
They're
the last pictures

501
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:37,841
I have of them.

502
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,444
My family was
everything to me.

503
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,417
I want to have a family
with James one day.

504
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:53,189
I want to have kids
and grow old together.

505
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,924
That's my dream, too.

506
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,429
Might not ever happen.

507
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,700
You may not
know this, but...

508
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:07,337
I made a promise
to my mom and to myself

509
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:09,973
that I wouldn't
be intimate with a guy

510
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:11,574
until I was married.

511
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,445
That's a really
tough promise to keep.

512
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm proud of you.

513
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,816
I just can't believe

514
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,218
they're not gonna be
there on my wedding day.

515
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,890
My dad won't be
there to...

516
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,458
to walk me
down the aisle

517
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,759
and give me away,

518
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,762
and my mom won't
be there to help me

519
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,230
pick out my dress.

520
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,199
They will be there.

521
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,736
They wouldn't miss it
for the world.

522
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,407
You have to believe me.

523
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,942
I promise.

524
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,813
Thanks.

525
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,585
All right, come on.

526
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,954
Let's put
this stuff away.

527
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,023
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,293
Get some rest.

529
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,494
Yeah.

530
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,397
Ah, I got it.
I got it.

531
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,012
Excuse me.
Officer Webb?

532
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,447
Do I know you?

533
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,849
I'm Sergeant Ellis
with Internal Affairs.

534
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,018
Please step
out of the vehicle.

535
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,594
What's this about?

536
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:14,264
Do you know a member
of the EPD by the name

537
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:15,164
of Ed Young?

538
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,799
Yeah. So?

539
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,601
When was the last time
you had any contact

540
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:19,769
with Officer Young?

541
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,338
Called him last night.

542
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,773
I didn't reach him. Why?

543
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:27,010
Officer Young is dead,
Mr. Webb.

544
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,478
What?

545
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,713
He was killed yesterday.

546
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,715
An Oregon State Police
service revolver

547
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,985
registered in your name
was found at the scene.

548
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,253
My gun was stolen.

549
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,821
I've read the reports.

550
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:42,258
Excessive force
three times.

551
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,793
Questionable shootings.

552
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,129
This conversation is over.

553
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,210
James, stop.

554
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,512
You're being bad.

555
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,883
Baby, don't.

556
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,019
Don't. Mm.

557
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:45,188
No, James. Stop!

558
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,159
Get off her, asshole.
What the...

559
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,928
What the fuck, man?

560
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,565
Bill, what are
you doing?

561
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,300
You could have
hurt him!

562
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,868
Are you
following me? Bill?!

563
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,169
Yes, I'm following you.

564
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:03,039
This lover boy's
in some serious shit,

565
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,641
and now we both are.

566
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,776
Ed Young's been killed,

567
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,212
and my weapon and
James' cellphone

568
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,847
were found at the scene.

569
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,081
Yeah, well,
his cellphone was

570
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:12,782
stolen the other day,

571
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,050
so obviously
it wasn't him.

572
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,585
And you believe that?

573
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:17,387
Yeah, I do believe that.

574
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,492
Well, for your sake,
I hope he can prove it.

575
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,112
Hey, so listen,
I got a call from

576
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,114
a detective yesterday.

577
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,948
He asked if you were
working here Thursday.

578
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,016
Ah, shit.
Are you serious?

579
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,685
No worries.
I covered for you.

580
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,019
Ah, thank you,
Mr. Anderson.

581
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,422
Hey, listen,
I don't want you working

582
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,357
with your head
hurting like that.

583
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,359
Damn,
that was a cheap shot.

584
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,593
You listen to me.
If that Bill Webb

585
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:58,928
gives you
any more trouble,

586
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,363
if he even
looks at you funny,

587
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,431
you let me know,

588
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:02,765
'cause I got
some boys that'll put

589
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,767
some manners on him.

590
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,369
Might have to
take you up on that.

591
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,539
Hey, could I ask you
something, Mr. Anderson?

592
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,474
Shoot.

593
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,010
Why you always
looking out for me?

594
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:17,947
Well, sometimes,
I look at you,

595
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,749
and I see
a little bit of me

596
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:21,284
when I was your age.

597
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:22,885
Tell you the truth,

598
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,188
I been hoping some
of that would rub off

599
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,222
on my son, but...

600
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,926
Anyway, help Ryan with
the overnight shipment.

601
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,894
Then you take the rest
of the day off, okay?

602
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,096
Okay. I appreciate it.
Ryan!

603
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:34,564
Yeah?

604
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:35,998
Come help James.

605
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,233
Sure.

606
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,617
So my dad says
you got engaged.

607
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,686
Congratulations.

608
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,121
Yeah. Thanks, man.

609
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,022
She's hot.

610
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,096
I see her on campus
from time to time.

611
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,398
I bet you do.

612
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,235
I'll have
to introduce myself

613
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,003
next time I see her.

614
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,405
Yeah, you should.

615
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,536
Hi, sweetheart.

616
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:23,406
Let me know what time you'll
be home for dinner tonight.

617
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:24,473
Love you.

618
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,543
No more tears now.

619
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,846
I will think
upon revenge.

620
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,682
I'm sorry.

621
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,585
I know
it's my fault.

622
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,626
Hello, Bill.

623
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:46,429
I knew
I'd find you here.

624
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,130
You think you know me.

625
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,601
Listen, I know we
didn't grow up together,

626
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:53,302
and I was in the Army
by the time that

627
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:56,105
but, uh, I just
thought I would try...

628
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,773
They're trying to stop me.

629
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,508
What?

630
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,910
The messages,

631
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,979
they're from
Shakespeare's tragedies,

632
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:07,350
all the stories of evil deeds
and doomed love.

633
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,621
What has that
got to do with...

634
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:13,789
Mom's favorite thing
in life,

635
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,425
her passion was poetry.

636
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,029
Can I give you a little
brotherly advice?

637
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:22,932
Don't let
your feelings for James

638
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:25,534
blind you to what's
really going on.

639
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,703
I mean, these threats

640
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,305
aren't coming
from beyond the grave.

641
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:30,373
No, it's not James.

642
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,010
It's Shakespeare.

643
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,245
She's trying to warn me.

644
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:17,253
Hello.

645
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:19,555
Hey, James has
been in an accident.

646
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,823
He's at the hospital.

647
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:23,092
Oh, my God.
I'll be right there.

648
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,294
James has been
in an accident.

649
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,364
What? What happened?

650
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:30,199
Christine, wait!

651
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,871
Code blue,
room 203.

652
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:37,239
Code blue, room 203.

653
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,674
Yes.
It's on your right.

654
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,276
Okay, thanks.

655
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,778
My God, James.

656
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,547
My God!

657
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:45,614
You okay?
Sweetie.

658
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:46,616
What happened?

659
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:47,817
I'm okay.

660
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,586
All right, somebody
ran me off the road,

661
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,722
but the doctors
checked me out,

662
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:54,223
and I'm
gonna be fine.

663
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:56,826
You don't understand.
I can't lose you.

664
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,828
I know, sweetie.

665
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,096
It's okay.

666
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,901
Baby, you're
the only thing I care

667
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,403
about in this world.

668
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,707
I mean, why are we
waiting to get married?

669
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,012
I don't know.

670
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,913
Let's just do it.

671
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:20,850
I don't want to spend
another day without you.

672
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,752
Okay.

673
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:24,153
This mean...

674
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:25,321
Yeah.

675
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,156
Okay.

676
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,128
Love you.

677
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,634
I love you more.

678
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,867
Are you ready
to kill for me?

679
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:14,170
I'd die for you.

680
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,871
Are you sure about that?

681
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:17,373
Yeah.

682
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,886
You okay?

683
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:31,987
Hey, hey, hey.

684
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,189
Leave me alone!

685
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,370
Oh, for God's sake.

686
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:02,886
Wanted me to be

687
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,325
Dr. Webb,
it's John Anderson.

688
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:11,961
Uh, I'm sorry
for the short notice,

689
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,529
but is there
any chance you could

690
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:14,531
meet with me today?

691
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:15,931
I'm booked today.

692
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,333
Will tomorrow work?

693
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:19,468
Uh, it's... it's important,

694
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,304
and I just need to talk
to you for a few minutes.

695
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,340
I gotta get this
figured out.

696
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,108
I'm ready
to discuss more...

697
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,543
more ways of treatment.

698
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:28,577
What's going on?

699
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,816
I'm afraid Ryan
put my daughter

700
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,018
in some real jeopardy
this time.

701
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,554
Oh, God.
What happened?

702
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:41,690
I'm meeting with detectives
tonight to figure it out.

703
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,092
A female student
was attacked

704
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:45,060
at the university pool
last week.

705
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,096
Cops say they
can I.D. my daughter

706
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:48,197
outside the pool

707
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,399
at the time
of the attack.

708
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,537
Dr. Webb?
Are you still there?

709
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,239
Let's meet at the Crescent
Café at 10:00.

710
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,176
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

711
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,814
Ryan, Dave's here!

712
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,298
Hey.

713
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,767
I need to borrow
your car Saturday.

714
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,101
Done.

715
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:33,075
What's wrong
with your truck?

716
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,777
It won't start.

717
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,384
Zeal, let's go, honey!

718
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,557
Morning, Pop!

719
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,193
You scared me, baby.

720
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,095
You trying to give me
a heart attack?

721
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,430
Ah, you ready
for school?

722
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:55,231
Yep.

723
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,832
What do you got there?

724
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,267
It's my disguise.

725
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,503
Your disguise, huh?
Can I see it?

726
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:03,706
It's a secret.
I can't show you.

727
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,773
It's a secret?

728
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:07,376
You're gonna keep
a secret from your dad?

729
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:08,777
Ryan said
he's teaching me to be

730
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:09,745
his partner in crime.

731
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,113
He did, huh?
Yeah, I want

732
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:12,115
to talk to you

733
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:13,682
about that
on the way to school.

734
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:17,821
Hey, Donna.

735
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:18,988
Hey, hon,
you got a second?

736
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,423
Yeah, what's up?

737
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,825
Look, I'm meeting
Susan in a minute

738
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:23,726
to discuss Christine.

739
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:25,127
Is everything okay?

740
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,428
Bill, I can't live
like this anymore,

741
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,564
and I want this
resolved tonight.

742
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:29,365
What? Tonight?

743
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:31,400
Honey, I need more time.

744
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:34,169
She's in a really
fragile place right now.

745
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:37,172
She knows about us, Bill.
I can sense it.

746
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:39,174
No, you're
being paranoid.

747
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,944
She's just
really unstable.

748
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,812
She's here. Gotta go.

749
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:51,153
Donna. I really
appreciate you coming.

750
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,821
Absolutely.
It's my pleasure.

751
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,323
How are you?
I'm good.

752
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,592
I really need
your help with this.

753
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:59,295
Yeah. I find the whole thing
rather intriguing.

754
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,063
Well,
you're not living it.

755
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,899
By the way,
how is Bill holding up?

756
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,168
He's, um...

757
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,104
Well,
he's a basket case.

758
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:10,106
Wow.

759
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,707
Any news from the doctor?

760
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:14,209
Uh,

761
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:15,878
not good news.

762
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,683
Looks like it's gonna
be just Bill and me.

763
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:22,718
I'm so sorry.

764
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,523
So we're gonna get
your brother some help.

765
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:28,991
You understand?
Okay, Pop.

766
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:30,292
I'll miss him.

767
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,261
Don't want to be late.

768
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:34,897
Ms. Airlie will
be upset with you, huh?

769
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:36,131
Yep.

770
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,900
Did you finish that project?

771
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:39,134
Yep. I finished it.

772
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:41,236
All right.
Give me a kiss.

773
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:42,805
Love you.

774
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,373
Have a good day.

775
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,416
What the hell?

776
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,986
Ryan!

777
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,790
Hi, Mr. Anderson.

778
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,462
Eh...

779
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:08,263
I don't know,
though.

780
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:11,066
I... I will think
about it carefully.

781
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,039
So, uh,
Christine's case,

782
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,307
please,

783
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:19,575
tell me
what you think.

784
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,210
I'm just
too close to it.

785
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:23,245
Well, based on
what you've described,

786
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:24,646
I'm thinking D.I.D.

787
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,181
Interesting.

788
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,350
A severe trauma can
trigger the splintering

789
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:29,918
of a single personality
into two distinct

790
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,019
personalities.

791
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,522
You know, often
the second one is created

792
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:36,525
'cause the original can't
handle the issues at hand,

793
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,628
but it operates
as its own entity,

794
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,630
you know,
with its own agenda.

795
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,632
Well, then explain
the hallucinations.

796
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:46,301
Cognitive leakage.
I mean, any event

797
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,437
that threatens to expose
the original mind

798
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,672
to the alternate mind
must be blocked,

799
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:53,108
so the hallucinations
are kind of like...

800
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,711
psychological
rationalizations.

801
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,045
Hmm.

802
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,782
I have
to think about it.

803
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,817
You should trust me
on this one.

804
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:05,087
You know, it was
less than 100 years ago

805
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,889
that people thought
the mentally ill

806
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:11,293
were all possessed
by spirits of the dead.

807
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:14,062
I have got to get
back to the office.

808
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,164
Okay.

809
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,068
Great to see you.
Thank you.

810
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,070
Yeah.

811
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,175
Bye.

812
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,521
John!

813
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,990
John!

814
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,928
John!

815
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,896
Help, please!

816
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,766
Help!

817
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:53,435
Next we'll discuss
the supernatural symbolism

818
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:55,337
Shakespeare uses
in "Macbeth."

819
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:57,473
For example,
the witches represent

820
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:58,907
Macbeth's inner evil.

821
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,243
The brooding darkness
symbolizes the darkness

822
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,245
in Macbeth's heart

823
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,545
and the evil nature

824
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:06,014
of his horrible deeds.

825
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:08,083
Uh, go ahead, Ryan.

826
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,136
What the hell?

827
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,561
Susan?

828
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,090
Demon!

829
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:05,835
Susan.

830
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:13,075
There's... There's evil
in the house.

831
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,977
Are you sick?

832
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,214
Did you take these?

833
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,385
There's a demon
in the house.

834
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,253
Yeah, yeah.

835
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,022
How many of these
did you take?

836
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:29,658
Shh. Shh.

837
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,326
All right, come on,
let's get you out of this...

838
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:33,195
No! No! No!

839
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,201
There's evil
in this house.

840
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,436
I saw it
with my own eyes.

841
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:44,406
She drove
the big red truck.

842
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:45,874
What truck?

843
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,442
John Anderson,
she mowed him down.

844
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:48,543
She killed him.
I saw it with

845
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:49,611
my own eyes.

846
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:50,812
John Anderson's
dead because of her.

847
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,547
What are you talking about?

848
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:53,849
All right, come on.

849
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,584
No, she's possessed!

850
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:58,020
She's possessed!

851
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,456
She's possessed,
honey.

852
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:04,693
She's possessed!

853
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,768
Hey, do you know
where your, uh, dad's at?

854
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,038
He was
in an accident

855
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,672
yesterday.

856
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,707
Is he all right?

857
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,410
He's dead.

858
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,679
Oh, my God.

859
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,213
What are you
talking about, he's dead?

860
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,348
Hit-and-run.

861
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,017
Where?

862
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,886
Oh, for God's sake!
Does it matter where?

863
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:37,793
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

864
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,495
I'm Christine,
by the way,

865
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:41,497
his fiancée.

866
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:43,632
Yeah. My dad
was all excited

867
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:45,367
about you guys
getting married.

868
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,869
He wanted me
to give you this.

869
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,006
Thank you.

870
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:53,408
I'm really sorry
for your loss.

871
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,944
Let's go.

872
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:56,946
Take care.

873
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,485
"James, congratulations
to you and Christine.

874
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,120
"I know we're
both a little

875
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,254
strapped for cash

876
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:07,355
"until
business improves,

877
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,357
so I'd be honored

878
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,392
"if you would accept
my cabin as your

879
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,426
honeymoon getaway

880
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,395
"and my wedding present
to you.

881
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,030
Best wishes, John."

882
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:05,013
You've been
fucking amazing.

883
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,485
Pretty soon,
we'll be together.

884
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,053
Can't wait.

885
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,058
So tell me
about our fall guy.

886
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,328
I'll take care of Dave
Saturday night.

887
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,463
Mm.

888
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,031
What's his motive?

889
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,267
Uh...

890
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:26,902
obsession.

891
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:29,437
Couldn't deal with your
marriage to James.

892
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,441
Perfect.

893
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,406
Congratulations.

894
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:07,242
Thank you so much.

895
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:09,611
Hey, it's a shame Susan
couldn't make it.

896
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,146
Is everything okay?

897
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,081
Yeah, I guess
she came down

898
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,983
with stomach flu
or something.

899
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:17,018
Take good care
of Christine,

900
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,988
'cause if anything happens to
her, I'll kill you,

901
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,924
and I'll make it
look like an accident.

902
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:25,427
You guys have fun
at the cabin!

903
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:28,630
Give me a call when you come
up for air, huh?

904
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,365
I will.

905
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,200
Bye, big brother.

906
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,102
Bye.

907
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,214
So that's over with.

908
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,715
Mm.
Got mixed emotions,

909
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:22,150
but she seems
to be happy,

910
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,252
and I guess that's all
that matters, right?

911
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,922
Everyone was disappointed that
you weren't there.

912
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:30,058
Well, your sister is
a very sick girl, Bill.

913
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,860
Oh, God,
please just don't.

914
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:33,295
Just don't.

915
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,464
Donna was right.

916
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,000
You talked to Donna?

917
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:43,038
She's developed two very
distinct personalities.

918
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,075
You know, it's interesting.
Two sides...

919
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:50,578
Chrissy and Christine.

920
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:55,850
Now, Chrissy
is the evil one...

921
01:05:55,852 --> 01:06:00,822
and she absorbs
all of Christine's pain

922
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:03,491
and settles all
of her grudges for her.

923
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,260
That's ridiculous.

924
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:06,328
You know what?

925
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,030
I still don't understand
why in the world

926
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:11,833
she would ever
kill John Anderson.

927
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:15,103
Susie, you really gotta
stop taking those pills.

928
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:17,472
I know what I saw, Bill,

929
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,141
and Monday morning,

930
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,943
I'm going to the police,

931
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:24,813
and I'm going
to tell them everything.

932
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,815
Yeah, you do that.

933
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:29,351
You're just gonna
make a goddamn ass

934
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:30,353
of yourself.

935
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,601
We did it.

936
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:55,236
Yeah, we did.

937
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,573
Can you believe it?

938
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,575
Nope.

939
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,080
Why are you so sad?

940
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,183
It's nothing.

941
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,589
Why are you crying?

942
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,259
Just love you so much.

943
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,405
Hey, wait.

944
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:31,539
What?

945
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:34,742
I have a surprise
for you in my car.

946
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:37,512
Go get it?

947
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,947
What is it?

948
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,216
It's a surprise.
I can't tell you.

949
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,717
It's in my trunk.

950
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,888
Okay.

951
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,189
Go.

952
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,061
I love you.

953
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:54,762
I love you.

954
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,134
It's the blushing bride.

955
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:35,336
Hey, big brother.

956
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,772
Could I ask you
a favor?

957
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,174
Yeah. What's up?

958
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:43,578
If you can't,
I understand. I just...

959
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,247
Is there any way you
could come scope out

960
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:47,715
the cabin tonight?

961
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:48,883
Tonight?

962
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,653
Yeah. Is that
too much to ask?

963
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,655
Is everything okay?

964
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,423
I think so.

965
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,725
Maybe I'm
just paranoid. I...

966
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,928
just feel like
someone's following us,

967
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,530
and I don't want
to bother James.

968
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,266
Give me 30 minutes
to get up there.

969
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:07,769
Thanks.
I owe you big time.

970
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,326
Motherf...

971
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,445
James.

972
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,652
What?
James.

973
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,492
Zeal, scram.

974
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,964
You little bitch.

975
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:46,434
It was you the whole time,
wasn 't it?

976
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,238
You don't even
have the balls to pull

977
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,272
that trigger, Ryan.

978
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:54,309
You know that.
What do you think, Ryan?

979
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,311
Think if you kill me,
she's gonna want you, huh?

980
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:58,946
Think that's
what it's about?

981
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,884
You're nothing
but a little freak.

982
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:07,755
Christine?

983
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:14,028
It's a terrifying
feeling, isn't it?

984
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,564
Lying helpless,
waiting to die?

985
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,435
It's how they felt,
James.

986
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:24,072
What are you
talking about, baby?

987
01:12:24,074 --> 01:12:27,342
My parents, James.

988
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,512
Baby, have you
gone crazy?

989
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,684
Maybe.

990
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:47,328
Ah, look at our
sleeping beauty

991
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,563
up there.

992
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,098
James,
be careful, please.

993
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,265
Will you relax?

994
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:53,401
When it rains this hard,

995
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:56,938
it usually only lasts
a few minutes.

996
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,513
How you doing
up there, buddy?

997
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:08,149
Uh, the highway's flooded.
I gotta take this exit.

998
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:13,221
By the way, I'm sick
of your comments

999
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,189
about my lack
of education in front

1000
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:16,424
of our daughter.

1001
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:23,064
I don't like your tone.
My tone?

1002
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:24,766
Yes,
your condescending tone.

1003
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:25,933
You started it.

1004
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,442
You sound like a child.

1005
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,644
Stop treating me
like a child.

1006
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,513
What's going on, buddy?

1007
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:42,150
Well, the car stalled.

1008
01:13:42,152 --> 01:13:43,751
What?

1009
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,663
- Well, there you go.
- Oh, thank God.

1010
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,470
Hey, watch out!
You're in reverse!

1011
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:03,472
There's a train!

1012
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,339
James,
what are you doing?!

1013
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,041
James, there's a train!

1014
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,605
James!
Sorry!

1015
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:12,914
James!

1016
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,857
God. Oh, my God.

1017
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,992
Oh, no! No!

1018
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,694
No!

1019
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,504
Just take
responsibility

1020
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:38,072
for what you did,
James.

1021
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:41,075
Christine,
I did it for you.

1022
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,744
For us.

1023
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,782
They were never gonna
let us be together.

1024
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:48,784
You know that.

1025
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,321
And I thought it
was gonna make it easier.

1026
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,489
I really did.

1027
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,892
But I was wrong.

1028
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:05,666
I wish
I could take it back.

1029
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,540
I'm sorry.

1030
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,277
Give me the gun.

1031
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:20,381
No, Christine, please.

1032
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,817
You know, it didn't
have to be this way.

1033
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,387
This is your fault,
James!

1034
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:27,588
Christine, no, please!

1035
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:31,726
No, I loved you.
I loved you.

1036
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,595
How could you do this?
This is unreal.

1037
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,313
That wasn't the plan.

1038
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:54,549
Your prints
are all over the gun.

1039
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:56,851
Just shut up, Ryan!

1040
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,786
Ah, fuck.

1041
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,292
Okay. Okay.

1042
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,699
Holy shit, Ryan!
Is that a cop?

1043
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,467
Oh, shit. They must
have heard the shot.

1044
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:14,635
Get him in the car.

1045
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,316
Oh, shit. Now what?

1046
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:36,617
Now what?

1047
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:37,885
Th-They're gonna
call his radio.

1048
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:38,986
There's gonna
be no response.

1049
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,655
Then they come
looking for him.

1050
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:42,390
Listen to me. Just calm down,
all right?

1051
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:43,591
If we get...
Just calm down.

1052
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:45,092
It's gonna be, okay.
Just trust me.

1053
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,394
Trust me,
Ryan, okay?

1054
01:17:46,396 --> 01:17:48,295
Just get rid
of the girl,

1055
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:50,031
and wipe down
the gun.

1056
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:51,098
Okay, trust me.

1057
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,770
Shit.

1058
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:21,595
Hey.

1059
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:24,098
Bill.
Bill, he's here.

1060
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:24,999
What?

1061
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:26,500
He's... He's
in the house.

1062
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:27,735
You have
to hurry.

1063
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:29,203
He's gonna
kill me.

1064
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,471
Stay on the phone
with me.

1065
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:31,739
Tell me exactly
what's going on.

1066
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:32,940
I'm almost there!

1067
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:35,543
He shot James.

1068
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:37,178
James is dead.

1069
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,345
Who shot him?

1070
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:39,347
Ryan.

1071
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:40,348
Ryan Anderson.

1072
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:41,349
Bill,
please hurry.

1073
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,616
He's gonna
find me.

1074
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:44,051
Where is he?
Are you in the house?

1075
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,387
Yes, I'm locked in the bedroom.
Hurry.

1076
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,122
Okay,
I'm five minutes away.

1077
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:49,990
Just don't...

1078
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:51,926
Chr-Chri...

1079
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,600
131.

1080
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:00,602
131.

1081
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:02,002
Go ahead, 131.

1082
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,604
Code three,
1822 Roaming Wood Road,

1083
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:04,438
Cottage Grove.

1084
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,240
Send every car
in the area.

1085
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,575
Roger, 131. En route.

1086
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:04,098
I gotta get Dave's car
back to town.

1087
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,133
Wow.

1088
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:13,040
How are you
gonna get rid of him?

1089
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,075
Oh, I...

1090
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:18,412
I'll do him
with the shotgun,

1091
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:20,548
and I'll, uh...

1092
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,516
I'll dump a bunch
of your stuff

1093
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:23,818
around his trailer,

1094
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:27,288
make him look like
the classic stalker.

1095
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,026
There's tire tracks
all over this place.

1096
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,197
And what about

1097
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,331
our other loose end?

1098
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,001
Don't worry
about a thing.

1099
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,537
She's...
She's taken care of.

1100
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,274
Perfect.

1101
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:48,442
Yeah.

1102
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:51,245
Take this off.

1103
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,568
Come here.

1104
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,432
Choke me.

1105
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:46,567
What?

1106
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,535
Don't stop.
Choke me.

1107
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:49,770
You're k-kidding.

1108
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:08,822
No!

1109
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:11,992
Hey!

1110
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:13,661
You're a fucking dead man! No!

1111
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,742
Listen to me.

1112
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:31,779
I need you to tell me
what's going on.

1113
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:34,982
Susan says that
you've killed someone,

1114
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:37,818
that she can
place you at the scene

1115
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,053
of a homicide.

1116
01:22:39,055 --> 01:22:43,157
Now if you need help,
I can help you,

1117
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:46,260
but you've gotta
be honest with me.

1118
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:49,430
The police are gonna
be here any second.

1119
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,737
You're in a lot
of trouble, Bill.

1120
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,156
Miss Webb,
what was the nature

1121
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,659
of your relationship
with the two victims?

1122
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:19,661
Miss Webb?

1123
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:25,132
So do you know
this Ryan Anderson?

1124
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:27,735
What?

1125
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:30,537
Did you know
Ryan Anderson?

1126
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:34,208
No. I think he worked
at the sawmill with James.

1127
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:36,977
We found this
in the front seat

1128
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,312
of one of the cars.

1129
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:40,247
Do you recognize
this weapon, Mr. Webb?

1130
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:43,784
Might be mine.

1131
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:45,919
It might be yours?

1132
01:23:45,921 --> 01:23:48,622
How did it get here?

1133
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,458
I don't know.

1134
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,394
We got
two dead bodies,

1135
01:23:53,396 --> 01:23:55,829
one young man in his
early twenties,

1136
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,799
one in his fifties,
a Sheriff

1137
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:00,934
both shot
execution style.

1138
01:24:00,936 --> 01:24:02,336
Shotgun wounds?

1139
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:04,338
Definitely.

1140
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,775
Do you know anything about these
bodies, Mr. Webb?

1141
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:11,311
I want an attorney.

1142
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:20,254
And what about
our other loose end?

1143
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,390
Don't worry
about a thing.

1144
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:25,759
She's...
She's taken care of.

1145
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:31,465
Susan says that
you've killed someone,

1146
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:33,734
that she can
place you at the scene

1147
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:34,736
of a homicide.

1148
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,871
We're almost done,
sweetheart.

1149
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:40,641
Just one more
little thing.

1150
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,253
Hi.
Hi, Mommy.

1151
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,456
Thank you,
Mr. Blooms!

1152
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:56,557
Take care, Susan.

1153
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:58,225
Thank you.
Bye.

1154
01:24:58,227 --> 01:25:02,796
Oh! Oh, I missed
you so much!

1155
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:04,431
So what did
you learn today?

1156
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,601
I learned how to play
"Mary Had A Little Lamb."

1157
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:08,735
No way.
Yes.

1158
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:10,137
'Cause you are
my little lamb.

1159
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:11,638
You can't catch me!
Yes, you are!

1160
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,574
Yes, you're
my little...

1161
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,272
By the pricking
of my thumbs,

1162
01:31:19,274 --> 01:31:22,843
something wicked
this way comes.
