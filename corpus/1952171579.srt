1
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:05,670
(distant siren wails)

2
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:10,600
(helicopter whirring)

3
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,169
(distant bird screeches)

4
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:18,150
(thunder rumbles)

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,983
(engines rewing)

6
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,673
(yells)

7
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:43,542
(grunts)

8
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,477
Billie!
(groaning)

9
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:48,647
Oh, my God, Billie,

10
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:49,915
are you okay?

11
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:51,974
What did you hit?

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,390
So, according to the girl,
one minute

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,727
she's blasting through the mud
and having fun,

14
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:02,661
everything's great,

15
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:03,662
the next thing
she knows,

16
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:05,564
she's lying upside
down in the dirt,

17
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:07,066
staring at
chemical waste.

18
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,200
She called Hazmat.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,234
Now, it's not toxic.

20
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,702
They saw the barrel
was buckling,

21
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:14,206
they thought it
might explode,
so they opened it.

22
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,140
Ugh!

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,241
Yeah, whoa-ho.

24
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,576
(coughing)

25
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,144
Soap mummy.

26
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:20,512
Adipocere,

27
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,214
a.k.a. Mortuary wax.

28
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,917
This is what you get
when fatty tissue decomposes

29
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,419
in an alkaline
environment with
limited oxygen.

30
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,154
All you need
is a little moisture

31
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:29,922
and enough time.

32
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:33,025
Anaerobic bacteria
digest body fats,

33
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,594
converting them
into a waxy solid.

34
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:38,430
Kind of like the way
they make vegetable shortening.

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,432
I may never eat
another French fry.

36
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:42,534
How long you think
he's been in there?

37
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:43,702
How do you know
it's a he?

38
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:44,636
Five, six weeks,
minimum.

39
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:45,938
With all this wind and weather,

40
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:49,441
any evidence of the dump
is long gone.

41
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,432
We got evidence.

42
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:54,541
Signed, sealed and delivered.

51
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:31,049
Gentlemen, saponification
occurs most frequently

52
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:31,817
in infant burials.

53
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:32,784
That's because
their bodies

54
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:35,220
have more fat,
and their bacterial flora

55
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,490
aren't fully developed.

56
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,225
Slowly...

57
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:42,594
Hold it.

58
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:43,495
Huh.

59
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:45,664
Look at this.

60
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:48,132
Something for Catherine.

61
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:52,171
All right, let's pull
the rest of this out.

62
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,038
Now, historically,

63
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:56,275
saponified corpses that maintain
their physical features

64
00:02:56,275 --> 00:03:00,312
were looked upon as, uh,
incorruptible, even saintly.

65
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:03,115
So, when it happened
to children,

66
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,683
it just reinforced that notion.

67
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,518
Hand me that foot there,
would you?

68
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:08,820
Okay.
(gagging)

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,688
You know,
interestingly enough,

70
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:15,327
since formaldehyde is alkaline
and American caskets are sealed,

71
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,297
there are more bodies
in this country

72
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:19,198
turning to soap now

73
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,334
than at any other time
in human history.

74
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,335
We are, in fact,

75
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,037
the adipocere
capital

76
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,605
of the world.

77
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,841
USA... we're number one.

78
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:33,312
(horns honking)

79
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:34,780
Are you serious?

80
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,081
David lost a body?

81
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,216
It happens.

82
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,084
When I was working
in Minneapolis,

83
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:42,054
we had two John Smiths
come in on the same day.

84
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,056
Sent the wrong one
back to Canada.

85
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,291
Anyway, our body's
still in the morgue.

86
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,161
David finally processed
his ten card.

87
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,296
Guy's name is Keith Mercer.

88
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,831
When did he come in?

89
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:53,732
11 days ago.

90
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:54,866
Found him in an alley

91
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:55,567
off of Fremont

92
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,070
in a pile of garbage
next to the dumpster.

93
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,304
11 days ago.

94
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,641
I guess we got no more
crime scene to process, huh?

95
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:06,278
Initially, the police
thought he was homeless.

96
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,212
He hadn't bathed,

97
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,581
no wallet,
watch or keys,

98
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,917
and he has scars
on his lower legs.

99
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:12,684
And a nice laceration

100
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:15,754
right here, with ecchymosis
on his left temple.

101
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,256
Yeah, cause
of death was

102
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,724
blunt force trauma to the head.

103
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,125
Could have been
an accident.

104
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,093
Could have been a lot of things.

105
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:27,926
Evidence without context
is ambiguous at best.

106
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,641
Did you ever chop wood,
split a log?

107
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,608
I've seen it done.

108
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,410
You should try
it sometime.

109
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,612
I find it relaxing.

110
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:41,647
Mm.

111
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:45,150
The blow here was
delivered in a
similar fashion.

112
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,918
The temporal
bone was hit,

113
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,253
driven down hard.

114
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,855
Upper palate smashed.

115
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,790
Most of the teeth gone.

116
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,292
What about the foot?

117
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,427
It looks as though
that's been sheared off.

118
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,663
Yeah, by something
fast and powerful.

119
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,630
Industrial accident?

120
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,133
No, industrial accidents
are messy.

121
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,201
These cuts
are too clean.

122
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,369
My guess...

123
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,404
single impact.

124
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,871
How about an axe then?

125
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,641
Possible.
I'll cast the tool marks.

126
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,743
Body in a drum in the middle

127
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:12,444
of the mountains.

128
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,314
Well, if the head
and hands were missing,

129
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,148
I'd be saying
mob hit.

130
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:18,950
Could be ritual
mutilation or
fetish murder.

131
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,153
So, ID from dental records
is out.

132
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,187
Right.

133
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:23,221
How about DNA?

134
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,957
Bone marrow
may still be viable.

135
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,225
My thoughts exactly.

136
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:29,795
The preferred sample
is a large bone

137
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:30,696
with a portion of joint,

138
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,231
then we freeze,
grind and sequence.

139
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:34,766
Want a breast
or thigh?

140
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,233
It's your kitchen.

141
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:38,224
(whirring)

142
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:42,174
Hey, Sara, I don't want
to cross any lines here,

143
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,475
but, uh,
I've got this buddy

144
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,677
who's not going out
with anybody...

145
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,446
No. No, no,
forget it.

146
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,014
Hey, Grissom bailed.

147
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,183
You guys are with me.

148
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,217
Good.

149
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,185
He's a cool guy.
No.

150
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,753
I mean, you don't...
No, Nick.

151
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,688
Listen, just hear me out
for a second.

152
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,533
(grinding)

153
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,478
(high-pitched whirring)

154
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:47,557
Gone but not forgotten.

155
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,002
DNA hit
on the soap mummy?

156
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:52,838
Yeah. His name was
Christian Cutler.

157
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:53,972
You got to love
OODIS.

158
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:54,940
What's his felony?

159
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,807
He wasn't in OODIS.

160
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,642
Department of Defense Registry.

161
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,144
He was in
the Army.

162
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,011
An E-5 sergeant,

163
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,948
honorably discharged
three years ago.

164
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:04,416
The guy drove tanks.

165
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,317
Well, that fits.

166
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,585
You know that fraternity ring?

167
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:07,486
It's not a fraternity ring.

168
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:10,021
Omega Zeta Alpha
is a mechanical engineering

169
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,122
honor society.

170
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,624
Hard-core mechie.

171
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,825
Hey, hey...

172
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,994
want to know
where his drum came from?

173
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:18,029
(distant siren wails)

174
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:21,032
Chemical companies serialize
all their shipping containers.

175
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:24,069
That way, if hazardous waste
ends up where it shouldn't be,

176
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,337
they know where it came from.

177
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,338
(loud techno music playing)

178
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,573
This place seems lively
for a warehouse.

179
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,842
A good place for
a rave, though.

180
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:31,576
Hello.

181
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,144
The cover's
25 bucks

182
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:34,012
each.

183
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,380
I got a coupon.

184
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,918
(crashing
and loud music playing)

185
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,586
One minute to go,

186
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,889
and Slaughter the Bot
pulls into the lead!

187
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:44,856
Robot Rumble.

188
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,192
Demolition derby
by remote control.

189
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,994
They got a show
on cable TV.

190
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,896
And here comes Spiker Chick.

191
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:54,366
The death blade goes up,
and the death blade comes down.

192
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,067
Oh! Slaughter
the Bot is made

193
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:00,197
of titanium, but how
much damage can he take?

194
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:08,380
Uh-oh, it looks like a jam-up,
but with this much horsepower,

195
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,177
it won't last long.

196
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,552
Slaughter's driving Yellow Belly
into the wall,

197
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,153
trying to shake him off.

198
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:18,023
Oh, it's mayhem in the middle.

199
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,424
Yeah! Yeah!

200
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,393
...on his back,
taking a pounding.

201
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,063
Watch out for Spiker Chick
with the death blade.

202
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:30,468
Oh, no! We got
a Spiker Chick sandwich!

203
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,405
Spiker Chick
is going for Slaughter.

204
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,674
Oh, again and again!

205
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:40,045
Oh, and in a dazzling array
of skill and deception...

206
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,479
Metal weapons,

207
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:45,951
money, competition,
testosterone.

208
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:49,220
We got a roomful
of murder suspects.

209
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,423
Your winner:

210
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,024
Slaughter the Bot!

211
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,151
Whoo! Whoo-whoo!

212
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,997
(beeping)

213
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,537
Bots fight all over the country,

214
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,238
on TV, all over the world.

215
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:09,040
This is an informal venue

216
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,041
where competitors can come

217
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,177
to hone their skills
and their machines.

218
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,212
You have
a gaming license?

219
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,246
I don't need one.

220
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,114
See, I just put on a show.

221
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,449
If people bet,
that's their business.

222
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,618
You're the only house in Vegas
that doesn't take a cut.

223
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,020
Hey, my daddy ran
an independent
shipping company.

224
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,488
He ran it right
into the ground.

225
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:24,689
He died broke,
but he left me

226
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,224
a bunch of empty warehouses.

227
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,459
I needed revenue,

228
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,493
so I developed a new market.

229
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,495
Hey, Jimbo, you looked
ferocious out there.

230
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,796
Thanks, Ginger.

231
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:32,263
We lost.

232
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,198
Yeah, but I like a guy
who goes down with style.

233
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,605
Look available, be unobtainable.

234
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,273
Keeps them coming back for more.

235
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:43,775
Want to tell me

236
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,470
what this is all about?

237
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,514
That's Chris Cutler.

238
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,148
He's dead.

239
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,317
We found his body

240
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,686
stuffed in a chemical waste
drum from this warehouse.

241
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,689
When was the last time
you saw Christian?

242
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,291
God, about six weeks ago.

243
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,589
Robot Rumble, big free-for-all.

244
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,199
Smash-N-Burn
was on fire that night.

245
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,002
Dismantled three or four bots.

246
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,172
Yeah! (laughing)

247
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,040
He had the kind of night

248
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,808
that most of these
boys dream about.

249
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,843
Using the thing that he built

250
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:21,546
to destroy the thing
that the other guy built.

251
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,181
It's a basic male drive.

252
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,182
That kind of puts that whole

253
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,717
weapons of mass
destruction thing

254
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,218
into perspective.

255
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:31,256
I take it this Chris
was not well liked.

256
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,191
Let me put it to you this way...

257
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,060
nobody likes
a winner who needs

258
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,628
to shove it
in your face.

259
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:37,529
We're going to need you

260
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,698
to identify the guys
he fought with that night.

261
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,632
As well as their bots.

262
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:43,101
We can't have a murder
without a murder weapon.

263
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,092
We'll take them all.

264
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:51,876
Keith went to Yosemite
to climb El Capitan.

265
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,245
The Shield Headwall.

266
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,647
Did you go with him?

267
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,149
I drove to Taos
to see my sister.

268
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,384
And got back when?

269
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,051
Ten days ago.

270
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:03,088
Keith's gear was in the living
room, but he wasn't there.

271
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,089
What did you do then?

272
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,623
I called his cell phone.

273
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:07,592
I called his office.

274
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:10,095
And then I called the Park
Service, and all they said

275
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,197
was that Keith had been by
to pick up his permit.

276
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,633
So then I checked the hospitals
up there and nothing.

277
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:19,137
And then I called
the hospitals in Vegas.

278
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,332
And then I called the police.

279
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:26,911
I did everything I could do
and nobody would pay attention.

280
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,347
Mrs. Mercer...

281
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:32,083
you have my attention.

282
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,575
And I'd like to see your house.

283
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,291
Looks like his gear's all here.

284
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:45,597
I don't see a sleeping
bag, though.

285
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:46,798
It looks like someone

286
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,366
was trying to clean up, too,

287
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,667
but forgot to use

288
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,236
their Murphy's Oil Soap.

289
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,671
Yeah.

290
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,161
Luminol.

291
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,312
You called it.

292
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,449
Positive for blood.

293
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,975
And a trail
of bloody footprints.

294
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,943
I may have blood here, too.

295
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,354
Grissom.

296
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:22,783
I think I might have
just found our murder weapon.

297
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,930
Spiker Chick,

298
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,298
Donsueme,

299
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,000
Slaughter 10?

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,036
You really think
one of these things
killed your vic?

301
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,838
They're fast,
they're powerful,

302
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,907
and the weapon
characteristics fit,

303
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,308
so I can't rule them out.

304
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,509
Well, you know what they say...

305
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,845
it's what's on the inside
that counts.

306
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,247
(drill whirs)

307
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,839
Well put.

308
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:20,919
I got blood.

309
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,453
Yeah, join the club.

310
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,088
I'll take these to Greg.

311
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:27,421
I'll get going
on the tool marks.

312
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,498
(saw whirs)

313
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,065
Any luck?

314
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:41,499
No.

315
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,035
Tool marks don't match
the vic's wounds.

316
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:44,969
Mm.

317
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,838
Could have saved you the time.

318
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,941
DNA beats tool marks
every time, you know.

319
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,609
I ran your blood samples.

320
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:54,178
Got a match,
all three of them.

321
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,680
Victim's blood,

322
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,617
on three different parts
from three different bots?

323
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,985
That doesn't
make any sense.

324
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:04,182
Well, where did
the parts come from?

325
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,095
I buy and sell and trade
parts all the time.

326
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,363
From all over the place.

327
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,931
Salvage yards, swap meets, eBay.

328
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,400
They usually have blood on them?

329
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,967
I don't check.

330
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,869
Doesn't matter
if they're clean or dirty,

331
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,536
only that they work.

332
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,638
Look, me and Chris
are partners.

333
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:22,407
I built the bot,
he drove it.

334
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,175
We kicked ass,
made good cash.

335
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,439
Why would I
want him dead?

336
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,181
You know, Brian,

337
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,012
I mean...

338
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,217
your best buddy
drops off

339
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,419
the face of the Earth

340
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,410
for six weeks...

341
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:39,690
You get a call
or e-mail

342
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,192
or postcard? No.

343
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,494
But you care
so much about him

344
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,030
that you do absolutely nothing
to find out what happened.

345
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,933
You can understand why we're
here, so straighten us out.

346
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,170
There was nothing weird about
Chris being gone like that.

347
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,405
He did stage effects
for Pyrotechnica.

348
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,040
Had some pretty good tunes.

349
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,209
Worth listening to.

350
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,544
Or not. Anyway...

351
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:00,678
when Chris
is on the road

352
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,413
he's a vapor trail.

353
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,582
He's not a phone call
kind of guy.

354
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:05,550
That's a nice ATV.

355
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,119
You ever take it
to the mountains?

356
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,953
Yeah, sometimes.

357
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:11,456
I, uh, I dabble
in ambient music.

358
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,590
She wants her daddy.

359
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,592
Yeah, I get some
pretty good samples

360
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:17,495
out in the mountains,
especially at night.

361
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:19,097
(baby crying)

362
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,429
Oh. Shh, shh, shh.

363
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,103
You know, you got a lot
of hobbies, Brian.

364
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,672
Oh, you don't have hobbies,
you go nuts.

365
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,740
Human beings are designed
to make things.

366
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,443
It's hard-wired
into our brains.

367
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:34,679
We make things and build things
to make more things.

368
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,714
It's what sets us apart
from the other animals.

369
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,250
Except monkeys.
Primates in general, I guess.

370
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,618
Brian, Brian.

371
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:41,452
Yeah?

372
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,019
Hobbies take up space.

373
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,490
You, uh, you don't seem to have
a whole lot of that here.

374
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,724
Do you have a workshop?

375
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,960
Uh, I rent a space.

376
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,622
(saw whirring)

377
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:57,602
All right, guys,
we got to clear the room.

378
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,770
Come on, let's go.

379
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,106
Excuse me, bud, you
want to shut that down?
Yeah.

380
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:04,275
Need you guys
all here to
clear outside.

381
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,209
Step out, would you?

382
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:07,512
(chuckling)
Oh. Okay.

383
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,281
Slow day oppressing the weak?

384
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,783
Don't scuff your jackboots,
Heir Commissar.

385
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:15,319
Just keep moving.

386
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,014
Hey, Nick.

387
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,295
All right,
we're all clear.

388
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,130
Is this
a machine shop

389
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,995
or a junkyard?

390
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:33,295
I guess, this is what passes
for pinups for these guys.

391
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,346
This is Brian's bot right here.

392
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,109
Smash-N-Burn.

393
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:47,185
And it's got
a spinning weapon.

394
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,552
I'll take it in
for tool marks.

395
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,649
It's missing parts, too.

396
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,102
So this is Hammer of God.

397
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:08,663
Or at least what's left of it.

398
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:12,401
Hammer of God
is against the ropes.

399
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:16,112
Rust stain.

400
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,694
23 inches.

401
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,896
That's standard diameter

402
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:34,626
for a 55-gallon drum.

403
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,846
(metallic clink)

404
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,587
Catherine, I've got spatter.

405
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,889
(saw whirring
and man screaming)

406
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,592
I think we've got
our murder scene.

407
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:05,653
I think we just got Ginger.

408
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,567
(distant siren wails,
horn honks)

409
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:13,271
We traced the machine shop back
through a holding corporation.

410
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,338
To me.

411
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,273
I own it.

412
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,607
It's a rental
property.

413
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:17,475
It's a good one.

414
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,576
It's popular
with the bot boys.

415
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:21,345
I would have told you
if you'd bothered to ask.

416
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,280
Well, we found this

417
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,475
in Brian's station...
your fingernail.

418
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:28,319
They break.

419
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,053
Yeah, they also scratch.

420
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,922
There were skin scrapings
under the nail.

421
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,591
We tested the epithelials.

422
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,826
They're Christian Cutler's.

423
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:38,296
Your shop,

424
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,130
your fingernail,

425
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,465
your waste drum
with a dead guy in it.

426
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,134
I stop by every
now and then

427
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,336
to make sure my
clients are happy.

428
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:48,105
Chris was there alone
one night working.

429
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:50,508
He kind of got
the wrong idea.

430
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,043
Play time.

431
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:53,978
No, Chris, knock it off.
It's not funny.

432
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,981
Shoving that rack
in my face ain't
too funny, either.

433
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,150
Stop it! Knock it off!

434
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,653
And you didn't think
this was... worth mentioning?

435
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,121
Hey, you guys
asked me

436
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:04,855
when I saw him last.

437
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:08,526
This happened the day before
the big free-for-all.

438
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:11,329
So, that's the price
of doing business?

439
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,863
Yeah, you could call it that.

440
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:13,831
Here's the way

441
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:14,498
I'd
call it...

442
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:17,501
Give me that,
you son of a bitch.

443
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,560
Hey, hey easy
with that.

444
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:20,938
(screaming)

445
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,607
Listen, I let the geeks
fantasize about me.

446
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,076
And most of them are harmless,

447
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:28,646
happy to stare and then go home
and spank the monkey

448
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,181
like good little college boys.

449
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:34,352
But Chris was
a dumb, vicious
Army grunt.

450
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,620
And maybe I wasn't
as careful around him

451
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,388
as I should have been,

452
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:40,084
but that doesn't mean
that I killed him.

453
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,658
Mrs. Mercer,
we found this statue

454
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,727
on your mantle.

455
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,929
It had your
fingerprints on it.

456
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:52,930
It was a wedding gift.

457
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,033
Well, we also found
your husband's blood

458
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,625
on the base of it.

459
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,772
Did you touch
or move this statue

460
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:03,941
at any time
in the last ten days?

461
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,109
Keith hated that thing.

462
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,744
He was always trying
to toss it.

463
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:10,281
When I came home,
I found it on the floor.

464
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,249
I thought
he'd put it there.

465
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:15,719
I found it in the hall closet,
in the garage.

466
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,788
I even found it in the car once.

467
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:20,256
It was like a game
for us.

468
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,261
Look, I came to you.

469
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:27,064
You guys have been
giving me the runaround

470
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:27,998
for over a week.

471
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:29,233
Could you tell us

472
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:33,966
what you kept in this box?

473
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:40,637
We inherited a coin collection,
and we figured...

474
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:44,045
we'd save it
for a rainy day.

475
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,484
(beeps)

476
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:53,557
No "Cutler-comma-Christian."

477
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,493
Ring's not his.

478
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,061
Never went to college.

479
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,597
That part wasn't in
his service record.

480
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:00,664
Scroll up.

481
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,097
Check the K's.

482
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:07,538
Hmm.

483
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:10,007
Hold it.

484
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,668
Bingo.

485
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:17,147
The rings belongs to you, Brian.

486
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:17,781
You must have dropped it

487
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:20,518
when you stuffing your buddy's
corpse into a barrel.

488
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,287
(panting)

489
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,623
Here's the way
this is going to play out.

490
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,091
This is the
best-case scenario.

491
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,058
We arrest you
for murder.

492
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,528
The, uh, the jury
likes your face,

493
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,829
and, uh, you get Man One.

494
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,265
Then you get to spend
the next 15 years

495
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:38,869
staring at your wife and kid
through a wire glass window.

496
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,205
Maybe if you're
lucky, uh...

497
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,239
when you get out,

498
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,833
you can take her
to the prom.

499
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,549
She's going to be
so proud of her daddy.

500
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,584
(sobbing)

501
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:57,247
(sobbing)

502
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:03,594
It was an accident.

503
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:07,197
You want a tissue
or something?

504
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,391
No.

505
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,325
Hmm.

506
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,872
We were in the shop.

507
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,408
It was real late,
no one else there.

508
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:22,179
I'd made some changes
to Smash-N-Burn's program.

509
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,315
We were testing them out.

510
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,785
Smash was acting...
really flaky.

511
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:30,220
Sluggish, and then...

512
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,790
(screaming)

513
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,126
It just went crazy.

514
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:38,596
With all that blood.

515
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,397
And... Chris...

516
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:43,267
in the middle of it
just lying there.

517
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:46,759
I had to make
it go away.

518
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,140
Hey...

519
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,709
Hey, Brian.

520
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,878
If it was an accident,
why didn't you report it?

521
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:56,947
It was my fault.

522
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:59,149
I was... I was so scared.

523
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:01,418
You disposed of the body.

524
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,955
Cleaned up the scene,
dismantled the bot,

525
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,123
and sold the parts.

526
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:08,258
All I could think about
was my wife,

527
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:10,160
and my little girl.

528
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,295
My little girl.

529
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:14,164
I didn't want
to lose them.

530
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:15,899
You got to believe me.

531
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,434
It was an accident.

532
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,469
(sobbing)

533
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,803
I'm so sorry.

534
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:21,805
(sobbing)

535
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,141
I'm so sorry.

536
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:26,777
The bank flagged Keith
Mercer's ATM card.

537
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:27,678
Really?

538
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:29,279
Somebody tried
to use it.

539
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,180
(laughs)

540
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,382
I guess the machine ate it, huh?

541
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:34,685
Yeah, but we got
the stomach contents.

542
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:36,482
Wicked.

543
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:13,186
(beeping)

544
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:16,724
(beeps)

545
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:19,919
(beeping)

546
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:23,728
(beeping)

547
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:32,943
You're not Keith Mercer,
but you have been

548
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:33,777
using his credit cards.

549
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:35,512
Do you care to tell us
about that?

550
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:37,715
He lent me his stuff,
told me

551
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,849
to have a
good time.

552
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,251
When did he tell you this?

553
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,219
Yesterday.

554
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,754
Yesterday?

555
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:44,221
Mm-hmm.

556
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:47,024
Mr. Mercer's been
in the morgue for ten days.

557
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,226
So unless
you were at a seance...

558
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,794
I found him, yeah...

559
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:53,263
Did you find
that suit there as well?

560
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:54,898
No. L-I bought the suit.

561
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:57,389
With this credit card?

562
00:28:58,268 --> 00:29:00,065
No. Um...

563
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:02,239
I used this one.

564
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,340
It's not a platinum.

565
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,365
It's a... it's a gold.

566
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:18,021
So this is Willy
Reddington's original gear.

567
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,056
This guy was classy.

568
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:22,259
He goes into a store,
buys new clothes,

569
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,527
and leaves the old ones behind.

570
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,062
And they tossed them
in the Dumpster.

571
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,831
I wish these people would
start checking IDs.

572
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,066
This is Vegas, baby.

573
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,534
Anybody can get lucky.

574
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,502
So, blood?

575
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,434
Not a drop.

576
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,064
No blood on his clothing.

577
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:40,611
The shoe treads don't match.

578
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,880
And the guy's got no car.

579
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,782
Yeah, how do you dump
a body with no car?

580
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,383
What did he do, drag
Mercer down the Strip?

581
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:50,087
And if you're robbing a house,
why don't you take more stuff?

582
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,455
Everything was still there.

583
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,322
Except that
coin collection.

584
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:57,594
I think the killer knew
what he was going to steal.

585
00:29:57,594 --> 00:30:00,297
Smash-N-Burn isn't some
cyborg death machine

586
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,331
with a mind of its own.

587
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,633
I mean, you got
to drive them.

588
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,802
Well, we prove it
didn't happened

589
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,470
the way that Brian
said it did,

590
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,105
you may have your killer.

591
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,300
Yeah.

592
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,817
(whirring)

593
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:55,953
Okay, here we go... I think.

594
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,888
It's not responding. It's...

595
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,161
Man...
(drill whirs)

596
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,363
You got a
transmitter module
in the remote

597
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:07,965
and a receiver
module in the bot.

598
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,032
They work
as a pair.

599
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,468
Yeah, and in every competition,
each team

600
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,670
is assigned a different
numbered frequency.

601
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,173
That way, each driver
can control their bot

602
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,542
without interfering
with anybody else's.

603
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,376
Or vice versa.

604
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,711
This is Smash-N-Burn's receiver.

605
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,407
And this is
Brian's transmitter.

606
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:29,386
The numbers don't match.

607
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,154
Okay, so when Christian died,

608
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:33,590
Brian wasn't controlling
the bot.

609
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,887
Somebody was.

610
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:41,698
Brian claims the
bot malfunctioned.

611
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:43,066
Well, we know it didn't.

612
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:43,934
It was responding

613
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:45,702
to a different
control frequency.

614
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:46,937
I don't think
he knew that.

615
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:49,439
If he did, he was
protecting somebody.

616
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,207
Hey, boss.

617
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:51,942
Um, I wasn't able
to pull any DNA

618
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,610
off your vic's
personal effects,

619
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,078
but I did find
something else.

620
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:56,947
Uh, those yellow spots
on his belt...

621
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:58,749
I ran them
through the GOMS.

622
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,217
You ran it?

623
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:01,051
Yeah.

624
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:02,052
They're sulfur.

625
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,121
Now, Warrick
mentioned something

626
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,989
about a missing
coin collection.

627
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:09,026
Now, some dealers...
bad ones... use sulfur

628
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,460
to polish up
coins for sale.

629
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,754
Shake and bake.

630
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:21,438
So I figure
that your killer

631
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:23,674
is either a coin dealer
or a collector.

632
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:26,510
And he transferred
the sulfur to the body

633
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,678
when disposing of it.

634
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:29,246
Are you a numismatist,
Greg?

635
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:33,116
Oh, my grandpa started me off
with a 1909 V.D.B.

636
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,284
"S" Lincoln penny.

637
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:35,452
Often referred to as a V.D.B.

638
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:37,988
Because it bears the monogram
of its engraver,

639
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:39,523
Victor D. Brenner.

640
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:40,757
It's a low mintage.

641
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:43,460
So, let's see, you surf,
you scuba dive,

642
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,494
you're into latex...

643
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,763
you like fashion models

644
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:47,798
and Marilyn Manson.

645
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:50,767
And you also have
a coin collection.

646
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,302
Weird, huh?

647
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,471
Well...

648
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:57,167
I raise cockroaches.

649
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:01,578
Look available,

650
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:02,612
be unobtainable.

651
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:05,482
Except when you're trying
to beat a murder rap.

652
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:06,483
Excuse me?

653
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,584
Whatever you
did worked.

654
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,719
Brian's going
down for you.

655
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:11,688
Oh, so, first you accuse me
of whacking Christian.

656
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:14,024
Now you're accusing me
of doing Brian?

657
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:15,659
Well, you are the queen bee.

658
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,160
The drones line up

659
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,028
to service you.

660
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,230
What the drones do
is make bots and break bots.

661
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,034
And while they're up wiring
and soldering all night long,

662
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,635
you know where I am?

663
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:27,296
I'm at home.

664
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,040
With this.

665
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,175
Does it have a name

666
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,144
or did it come with the wallet?

667
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:36,546
Pretty funny for a scientist.

668
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:39,316
Let me make it easy
for you.

669
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:41,018
And in case you can't spell,

670
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,687
that "E-S-Q" means
he and his entire law firm

671
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,188
are going to be
all over your ass.

672
00:33:45,188 --> 00:33:47,691
Next time you want
to talk to me,

673
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,056
talk to him.

674
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:55,365
(knocking)

675
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:57,534
Hey, I was able to pull

676
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:59,069
the cell phone records
for our vic.

677
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:01,104
Most of the calls
went to the office,

678
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,305
two went to the wife.

679
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:04,274
But there are two
who are interesting.

680
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:05,842
Jones Collectibles.

681
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,311
Guy is a small-time fence.

682
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:11,337
That mean anything to you?

683
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:19,848
Does now.

684
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:23,048
(door buzzing)

685
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:29,065
Anything I can help you with,
let me know.

686
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:37,274
I heard that you dealt in coins.

687
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:38,809
Really?

688
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,310
From whom?

689
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,572
Grissom.

690
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,114
He's a friend of mine.

691
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,849
We work together.

692
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:48,185
I'm looking to see
what you got.

693
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,585
I'd like to make a trade.

694
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:53,390
Why the flip?

695
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,126
I've been meaning
to get it slabbed.

696
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,253
(sirens blaring in distance)

697
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,265
Not bad.

698
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:03,934
No hairlines.

699
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:06,835
No fly specks.

700
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,601
You got yourself a slider.

701
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:14,444
I'd like to get myself
a 1916 "D" dime.

702
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:18,381
Been all over Vegas,
can't find one.

703
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,749
You got any?

704
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:22,752
I might have one,
but it's pricey.

705
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,153
Well, so is mine.

706
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,146
1907 Saint Goddins

707
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:53,316
double eagle gold piece.

708
00:35:53,316 --> 00:35:55,252
I've only seen that in books.

709
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:56,453
And that's as close as you get.

710
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:59,789
If you want to deal
for the "D" dime, it's yours.

711
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:02,485
I'll take it.

712
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:14,738
The bot was on
a different control frequency,

713
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:18,341
which means someone was using
a different transmitter.

714
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:19,876
Puppet master.

715
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,978
Somebody else
pulling the strings.

716
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:24,781
That would explain
why the bot was sluggish.

717
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:27,184
I think she's sick, Brian.

718
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,675
Maybe something's jammed.

719
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,024
So, what's the range of
those controllers anyway?

720
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:35,192
It's limited.

721
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,327
Definitely not outside
this building.

722
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:38,995
So, if somebody hijacked
Brian's bot,

723
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:41,898
they'd have to be nearby,
but... obviously,

724
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:43,365
out of sight.

725
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:47,437
Well, there's a good place
to hide up there.

726
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:50,463
Opportunity.

727
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:54,010
STOKES:
Maybe we've got motive.

728
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,313
Check it out.

729
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,381
Ooh, proud papa.

730
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:00,283
The man who built

731
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:01,885
Hammer of God.

732
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:06,254
Which leaves us
with... means.

733
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,555
Transmitter modules.

734
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,770
Yeah, check out
the 80s.

735
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,874
81, 82, 83... 85,

736
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:25,875
86?

737
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,477
And look what's missing: 84.

738
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:29,546
(Stokes chuckles)

739
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,411
I bet I know who's got it.

740
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:34,251
Guy came in a couple
of weeks ago

741
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,353
with this collection
looking to sell.

742
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:37,053
I bought it.

743
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:38,922
There must be $50,000 worth
of coins in here,

744
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:42,292
isn't there, Greg?
(indistinct police radio
transmissions)

745
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,560
At least.

746
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,563
You must have a record
of the transaction.

747
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:48,098
I know I got it somewhere.

748
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,332
Maybe it's in your car.

749
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,934
Mind if we help you look?

750
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:51,568
No, go ahead.

751
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,799
I got nothing
to hide.
(tosses keys)

752
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:02,279
Ten-inch subs.

753
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,014
400 watts.

754
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:05,415
Four channels?

755
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:06,616
That's state-of-the-art.

756
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,052
Those hot, too?

757
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,854
It kind of looks
like the DeLorean

758
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:12,055
from
Back to the Future.

759
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:14,791
Trace amounts of sulfur.

760
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:15,992
You don't artificially

761
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,494
tone your coins,
do you, Mr. Jones?

762
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:20,292
Hey, my merchandise
is authentic.

763
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,933
Well, you may have
some authentic blood

764
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:26,299
in your car as well.

765
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:33,009
Yeah, well, I cut my finger
the other day.

766
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:33,877
Hmm.

767
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:35,478
That's Keith Mercer's blood.

768
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:38,448
You know it and when
I get back to the lab,

769
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:39,816
I'm going to prove it.

770
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:42,979
I think you're busted.

771
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:55,165
So... what happened?

772
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,833
I lost.

773
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,335
You didn't lose.

774
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,064
You were destroyed.

775
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:09,412
(laughing harshly)

776
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:10,413
Ooh!

777
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,973
You got nothing left, Luke!

778
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:18,021
(laughing)

779
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:21,691
(horn blows)
Yeah!

780
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:24,194
And you wanted revenge.

781
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:26,529
You couldn't kill
Christian's bot

782
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:28,031
so you killed Christian.

783
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,599
I heard Brian killed him.

784
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,035
This is the
transmitter

785
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,037
from Christian's robot.

786
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,038
So?

787
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:38,439
So... it's got your DNA on it.

788
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:52,222
Brian wasn't in
control of the bot.

789
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:53,416
You were.

790
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,656
(metal clattering)

791
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:00,697
(whirring)

792
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:02,665
(screaming)

793
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,934
Oh, my God!

794
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,595
I can't turn it off!

795
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,176
(screaming)

796
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:22,952
The bot wasn't
the only thing you
manipulated, Luke.

797
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:24,920
Chris!
Chris!

798
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:26,689
Oh, my God.

799
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:28,224
What did you do?!

800
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:29,192
It was an accident.

801
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,693
The bot just... Oh, my God!

802
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:31,928
Oh, we've got
to call the cops!

803
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,596
If you do that,
they're going to think

804
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:34,531
you did this.
I didn't do it.

805
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:35,999
They're going to put you
in prison for life.

806
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:39,560
I'll keep this quiet, but you
have to get rid of this body.

807
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:43,766
(grunting)

808
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:47,744
Brian gave you up.

809
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:50,611
No place to hide now.

810
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:02,525
I know what it must've been like
for you.

811
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:06,296
Having created
something,

812
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:08,765
only to lose it.

813
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,500
Let me guess.

814
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,469
You have a kid?

815
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,170
Yes, I have a daughter.

816
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,973
And you think just because
you squeeze a baby out

817
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:20,136
from between your legs,
you know how I feel?

818
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:23,079
That's biology.

819
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,482
Any animal can do that.

820
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,016
Uh-huh.

821
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:33,823
But I took a thought
from my head and I made it real.

822
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:37,190
It was... perfect.

823
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,997
I guess the
only flaw then

824
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:43,329
was you.

825
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:52,542
How's it look?

826
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:53,676
Oh.

827
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:57,669
Blood in the car
is the victim's.

828
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:03,152
Keith Mercer
made a bad call.

829
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:05,622
Yeah, it sounds like
a pretty nice collection.

830
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:08,157
How about I come by Saturday
and take a look?

831
00:42:08,157 --> 00:42:09,626
Uh, this weekend's no good.

832
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,027
My wife and I are out of town.

833
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:13,587
Hey, what are you doing?

834
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:17,233
Told you that dude was busted.

835
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:20,566
What happened
to your enthusiasm, Greg?

836
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:25,141
Well... every time I make
another DNA match in here,

837
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:28,778
my world gets a little smaller.

838
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:32,048
Out there... felt large.

839
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:34,744
Out there means a pay cut.

840
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,252
I'm not about the money.

841
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:45,183
That's good to know.
