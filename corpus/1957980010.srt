00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,257
That doesn't sound good.

186
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:57,670
Duck livers?
Seriously?

187
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,246
Were your ears clogged

188
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,507
when I told you how tight
the margin is on this one?

189
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,751
Duck liver mousse, Nancy.

190
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,170
What better way to celebrate
the happiest day of their lives?

191
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,217
[Nancy] Well, we're trying
to run a business here.

192
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:13,594
We didn't go into this
to save every last dime.

193
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,615
We did it to bring beauty
and flavor into the world.

194
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,759
I don't know
why I stress over this stuff.

195
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:26,607
I should just let you figure out

196
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,845
how to keep the business
from going toes up,

197
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:30,536
which it is teetering,
every second,

198
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,631
on the brink of doing.

199
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,639
Honey...

200
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,957
I know this stuff
triggers for you,

201
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:44,625
but I swear to you,

202
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,719
a few extra bucks on a wedding

203
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:48,796
will not zap you back
to roaches in the garbage.

204
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,632
Not the garbage.

205
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,151
The stacked-up newspapers.

206
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,320
They dug tunnels
and built condos.

207
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,492
Well, after we get

208
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:04,053
some pomegranate glaze
on this fennel,

209
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,164
how about we get back
to proofreading?

210
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,741
Hmm...

211
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,502
You glaze.

212
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:11,577
Maybe I'll get some writing done

213
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,062
and I won't feel like

214
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,340
the whole day
went down the drain.

Thank you,

00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,906

Hi, Nancy!

00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,319
How's it going?

227
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,037
Not so good, Jack.

228
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,583
Hi, Karen.

229
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,406
Hey, what's wrong?

230
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,581
The lamberts got cold feet,

the engagement party's off,

232
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,745
they want their deposit back,

233
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:45,913
and we can't make payroll.

234
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:46,823
The bank's making us liquidate.

235
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,916
We're finished.

236
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,343
It's okay, we'll work it out.

237
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,178
Nancy, we always do.

238
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,664
Actually, no, Daniel,

239
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,257
this time, it's not okay.

240
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,526
You have no concept
of how close we are to the edge.

241
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,671
What if something
happened to me?

242
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,593
Do you even know we have
life insurance on each other?

243
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,266
I know what'll happen.

244
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,509
I'll be dead,

245
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,597
and you'll be leaving money
on the table.

246
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,694
Nancy.

247
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:10,938
You're going into a spin.

00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:12,606
Nobody's dying here.

Just going dead broke.

250
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,127
So, we'll downsize.

251
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:19,446
I don't want to downsize,
I want to upsize.

252
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,190
I want us to travel,

253
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,860
and drink rosé
on the beach in Portugal,

254
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,212

Well, right now,

259
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,985
my excitement's gonna be

are scraping at the door.

Maybe it just needs a jump?

267

No, I know that sound.

268
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,993
That sound is $1100
the other side of a jump.

Nancy, listen,

[Daniel] Really, mom?
Are you sure?

274

Can't think of a better home

than with you guys.

It's not catastrophic yet.

286
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,805
Um, mortgage, some bills, uh...

287
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:16,897
Enough to tide us over.

288

Look, yeah, I mean,

289
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:19,308

in the policies,

290
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,310
after fees and penalties,

291
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:22,547
the most you're gonna pull out
is a couple thou.

That's it?

by a whole lot more.

without paying.

no head for figures.

on the head and sent on my way.

00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,276
I don't want to do it, Nancy.

344
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:19,686
No shinier status symbol
than private chef.

345
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,832

346
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,136
And then they think
they own you.

00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:24,784

356
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:36,888
Can do for them.

a bed I can crawl into,

00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:51,218
in the kitchen.

365
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,571
It's a lot of pureed carrots,

366
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:54,630
but would it help?

367
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,482
Anything would.

368
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,576
Thank you, Daniel.

369
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:00,636
Would you still
need to find something?

370
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,580
And fast.

371
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:04,060
You don't know
how lucky you are.

372
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,584
I'd give my left arm
to make money doing what I love.

373
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:10,070
Why don't you try doing
what I love?

374
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,497
Nobody's gonna pay me

375
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:12,735
to mess up their dinner
for them.

376
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,092
That's not all I love...

377
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,079
Of course.

378
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,004
Teaching.

379
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:20,914
All those baby writers
out there,

380
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,659
hungry for pearls of wisdom,

381
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,312
and I've got more of 'em
than Tiffany's.

382
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,272
There you go.

383
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,003
Good morning, ladies!

384
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,861
Interested in learning
the tricks of the trade?

385
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,116
All the details
are on my website.

386
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:47,774
[♪♪]

387
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,018
[Iris] Nancy!

388
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:51,520
This is genius.

389
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,517
[Gary] I wish I'd thought of it.
In fact, maybe I will.

390
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,924
You won't mind the competition?

391
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,096
Nan, do you still have
that switchblade you got

392
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,454
when you were doing
the stalker in

393
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:01,955
<i>careful what you wish for</i>?

394
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:02,715
I'll bring it
to the next meeting.

395
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,866
Awesome!

396
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,362
I need to get
the killer's moves right

397
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:06,644
in<i> Princess in paradise.</i>

398
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:11,390
I'll trade you the night goggles
I got for<i> blood and roses.</i>

399
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,644
[Nancy] Ah, that'll be great.

400
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:14,986
[Iris] Haven't received
your RSVP

401
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,237
for Heartcon in Vegas yet.

402
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:18,472
We're all splitting
a penthouse at Caesar's

403
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:19,657
for the two nights.

404
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,784
Pricey, but...
You've gotta live the legend.

405
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,906
I've got so much going on
right now...

406
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,816
You know, the keynote speaker
is Nora herself.

407
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,076
Plus world-class networking.

408
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,373
Like, every agent on the planet.

409
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:34,755
Put you down for a "yes"?

410
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,342
Try and stop me.

411
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,013
- Ciao.
- Bye.

412
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:46,684
[♪♪]

413
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,510
[Daniel] I don't know, Nance.

414
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,920
You really think

415
00:19:57,939 --> 00:19:59,400
now is the best time
to ask your brother for money?

416
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,901
He just won some kind
of massive class-action thing.

417
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,533
He's flush!

418
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Have you called to ask
how his chemo's going?

419
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:07,205
Of course, I have...

420
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,236
And I don't think I like
the way you asked that.

421
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,602
[Nancy]<i> Marriages</i>
<i>are complicated things.</i>

422
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:16,272
<i>My husband and I
love being married.</i>

423
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,770
<i>We love being married
to each other.</i>

424
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
<i>Just not every day.</i>

425
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,374
Oh, my lord,

426
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,042
you are a sight for sore eyes.

427
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,728
Thanks for coming, Nance.

428
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:33,623
How was your flight?

429
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:34,756
Great, if I was a sardine.

430
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,235
I'll take this.

431
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,402
- Hey...
- Hey!

432
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,055
He's excited to see you,

433
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,816
but try not
to tire him out, okay?

434
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:46,035
He's not as strong
as he wants us to think.

435
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,640
Mm, this plum sauce...

436
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,252
Did you make it yourself?

437
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,754
Do you think she'd trust
anything in a jar?

438
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,071
No way.

439
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,424
So, tell me what's happening
with the kids.

440
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,668
Well, uh, Mark Jr.

441
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,079
Is blazing through
his sophomore year at UT,

442
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,414
majoring in bio,

443
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:08,582
and Sarah is burning down

444
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,250
the towers
of the mighty in law school.

445
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,270
I am so proud of her...

446
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,897
Thrilled to hear
they're doing so well.

447
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,772
Jennifer, do you think
you could make me

448
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:17,066
some of that amazing
Vietnamese iced coffee?

449
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:22,004
Um, I'll have to brew some,
but... sure.

450
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,406
Thank you.

451
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,009
Now, tell me
about your big case.

452
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:28,742
Did you grind their noses
into the ground?

453
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:31,747
We did okay.

454
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,794
I'm just gonna help Jen
with the coffee.

455
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:48,998
[Mark] It's Lucy
and the football, every time.

456
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:52,459
[Jen] Look, I know
how much you love her,

457
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,129
but you are her brother,
not her atm.

458
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:57,982
[Mark] We'd better get back.

459
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,638
Yeah, so, the case...

460
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,049
We did pretty good on the award,

461
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,643
uh, but taxes were a bitch,

462
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,072
and uh, the market's
so crazy right now, we...

463
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,366
I just put whatever I had left

464
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,334
into a two-bedroom
in south padre.

465
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,338
So, condo-rich, cash poor.

466
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,173
Wise choice.

467
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
Your coffee'll be ready
in a few minutes.

468
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:26,494
Thank you so much.

469
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,757
How much tarragon?

470
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:35,644
Mm, one-fourth cup tarragon
or to taste.

471
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:39,415
Basically meaning
we're on our own.

472
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,842
Well, if we want to make it
like they do in España,

473
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,861
I found a killer

474
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:43,602
two-week cooking class
in Barcelona.

475
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:45,588
And miss the adventure

476
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:47,365
of figuring it out
in our own kitchen?

477
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:49,516
Plus...

478
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,017
I know, I'm the one

479
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,870
who keeps saying
the belt's so tight,

480
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,350
we're running out of holes
to put the buckle in.

481
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:58,434
Well, maybe you should
hold off on the fun in Vegas

482
00:22:58,452 --> 00:22:59,768
till we're back on our feet?

483
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,879
Fun's got nothing to do with it.

484
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,382
Make the right connection
and I can get my book out there,

485
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,853
and you know
what that could mean.

486
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:07,793
You're just afraid
if you don't go,

487
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:09,053
your friends will spend

488
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
the whole time
talking about you.

489
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,448
Well, they will.

490
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,040
Next time you go
to one of these things,

491
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,119
the keynote speaker
is gonna be...

492
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:17,970
You!

493
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:19,121
Yes!

494
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,024
[♪♪]

495
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,722
Here is to the master of us all,

496
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:30,633
lady Diana Gabaldon,

497
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,651
and her three pillars of wisdom.

498
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:36,155
May they guide us always
on our literary paths.

499
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,489
All together now...

500
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:42,068
"Read a lot, write a lot,
and never, never stop!"

501
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,379
Yee-haw!

502
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:45,933
Sorry, your card
didn't go through.

503
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:48,984
That's an old one,

504
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:50,477
I should've cut it up
and tossed it.

505
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,290
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

506
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:06,058
[Waiter] This one seems
to be having a problem, too.

507
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,111
I must have forgotten
to tell them

508
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:08,353
I was going out of state.

509
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,429
If you could put it on my room...

510
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,282
I'm sorry,
we can't really do that.

511
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:13,951
Don't worry about it, nan.
I'll cover it.

512
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:16,269
Thank you. I'll pay it back
as soon as I get home.

513
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,706
Oh, whenever you're ready to.

514
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,276
You'll get through
this rough patch.

515
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,462
I know you will.

516
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:35,055
[♪♪]

517
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:48,611
[♪♪]

518
00:24:57,813 --> 00:25:01,290
[♪♪]

519
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:23,746
Those are your cold leads,
and that's the script,

520
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:25,484
but don't ever sound
like you're reading it.

521
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,582
Somebody gets abusive,

522
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,675
you hang up,
move on to the next call.

523
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,027
It's all about the next call.

524
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:31,178
You'll do great.

525
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:35,866
[Nancy]
<i>Your character's going along,</i>

526
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:37,993
<i>living her life
like the normal person she is.</i>

527
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,705
<i>So what's the shove
that pushes her out of normal?</i>

528
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:46,359
<i>Everybody talks about
the last straw,</i>

529
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,899
<i>the one that breaks
the camel's back.</i>

530
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:50,548
<i>The bigger question is...
What's the first straw?</i>

531
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,703
Is it possible
Daniel owed somebody money?

532
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,889
Maybe your family was in

533
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,707
some kind
of financial difficulty?

534
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,118
You show me somebody
who's never in a financial bind,

535
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:04,895
I'll show you Melinda gates.

536
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:07,202
<i>Can you imagine the allowance
she gets every month?</i>

537
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,548
Unless bill turns out

538
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,884
to be ebenezer scrooge
for the digital age, and...

539
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:13,237
Oh, god, there I go.

540
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,573
Like, Daniel always says,
"stay on topic, Nancy.

541
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:16,924
Don't go down
the rabbit hole!"

542
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:23,563
<i>I can hear him now...</i>

543
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,249
<i>And the look on his face...</i>

544
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,753
<i>but anyway, Daniel and I
were doing just fine.</i>

545
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,673
Do I have the pleasure

546
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,969
of speaking with, uh,
Mr. Mitchell Krayton?

547
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:44,918
Whatever you're selling,
save your breath.

548
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,753
Not selling a thing,
cross my heart.

549
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,664
Just responding
to the card you sent to us

550
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,256
at Sutton Murray insurance,

551
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:51,351
expressing interest

552
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:53,068
in a high-gain
investment-based policy.

553
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,929
I didn't send you squat.

554
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,097
Actually, you did,

555
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:57,522
as you can see right here,
it shows you...

556
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,842
Sheila!

557
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:00,987
How many times have I told ya

558
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:02,155
not to answer
every goddamn piece

559
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,699
of goddamn crap
that comes in the door?

560
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,868
[Engine turns over]

561
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,462
[Phone rings]

562
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:13,947
Hey, Joe.

563
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,115
Remember the policy

564
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,445
you sold to
Chuck and Belinda ledbetter?

565
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,801
Do I ever.

566
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:20,137
Commission saved our butts
on two months of mortgage,

567
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,287
<i>plus a bite out of...</i>

568
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,865
Nancy... Nancy...

569
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:24,141
Look, they got a better deal

570
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:25,792
and exercised
the 30-day opt-out.

571
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,219
<i>This blows big-time,</i>

572
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:29,011
<i>but you have to pay back
the commission.</i>

573
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:33,466
And what about you,
Mrs. Brophy?

574
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,985
Any enemies on your side?

575
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,614
Someone who might
have been trying to get to you

576
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:37,396
by hurting your husband?

577
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,490
Me? Ha!

578
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:42,308
The only enemies I've got
are the New York literary agents

579
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,810
who won't give me
the time of day.

580
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:45,478
Oh, you're a...
You're a writer?

581
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:48,148
Oh, yes,
cranking out the titles,

582
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,741
getting better with every book...

583
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:51,494
And they weren't so shabby
to start with!

584
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:07,834
Oh, honey...

585
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:10,095
Yeah, yeah, I know,

586
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:10,854
"these jerks
wouldn't know genius

587
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,023
if it bit 'em on the ass."

588
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:15,341
Obviously, they wouldn't,
or they would love your book!

589
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:18,195
Don't...
Just... do not.

590
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,532
- Nancy...
- What?

591
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:26,497
You're happy when you're
writing your books, right?

592
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:27,854
Yeah, like I'm doing exactly

593
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,373
what I was
put on the earth to do.

594
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,874
And that's what I see,

595
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,044
and you know I love reading
what you come up with, right?

596
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,047
Well, the hot parts.

597
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,532
There are a lot of those.

598
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,459
So, isn't that enough?

599
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,794
That it makes you happy
to do it,

600
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:44,722
and it's something we can share?

601
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:48,624
What does it matter
if the books get published?

602
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:50,786
What are you trying to say?

603
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:52,045
What I said.

604
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:55,232
What matters is that
it makes you happy to do it.

605
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:00,887
Like it was
some kind of craft project?

606
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:03,073
Like knitting or macrame?

607
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:04,224
Is that what
my writing is to you?

608
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,150
Nancy...

609
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,559
All those years,

610
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,114
you tell you me
how much you love what I write,

611
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,063
and now I find out,
the whole time,

612
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,082
you were secretly thinking
it was crap!

613
00:29:12,234 --> 00:29:13,475
I never pretended.

614
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,252
I always love what you write.

615
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,070
I'm just saying who cares
if anybody else does?

616
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,422
Right!

617
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:20,493
Because it's all just
Nancy's cute, little hobby!

618
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,000
That is not what I'm saying!

619
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:23,409
Yes, it is!

620
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,004
You don't know me at all.
You have no idea who I am.

621
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:27,765
I'll tell you what I do know.

622
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,083
That there is
no making you happy.

623
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:33,253
We build this beautiful life,
this house, the garden.

624
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,420
After 27 years,

625
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,106
we can't keep our hands
off each other.

626
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,183
How many people you know
still have that?

627
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:40,185
But you could be
Shakespeare and Warren buffet

628
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,019
rolled into one,

629
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,354
it still wouldn't be enough.

630
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:44,356
Oh, yes, this dazzling house,

631
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,933
the science experiments
growing in the floor tiles...

632
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,528
Oh, forgive me,
your royal highness,

633
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:53,106
I'm so sorry our palace
is not up to your standards.

634
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,793
I'm not going to even
dignify this with an exit line.

635
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:56,944
You just did.

636
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:01,965
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:04,802
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

638
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,545
I know how this sounded,

639
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:11,883
but truly, truly, truly,
that's not what I meant.

640
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,219
I want us to be happy.

641
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:15,887
Together.

642
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,631
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

643
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,150
I didn't mean it.

644
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,560
I know how it sounded.

645
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,654
I'm sorry.

646
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,047
I truly, truly am.

647
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,399
Ditto, it's just, sometimes...

648
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:30,218
I've got...

649
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:33,121
Some panko-crusted tenderloin
roasting.

650
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,150
Will be ready in 15 minutes.

651
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,985
Yeah?

652
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,337
Yeah.

653
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,971
I'll be down for it
in a minute, hon', okay?

654
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,016
Okay.

655
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:23,380
[♪♪]

656
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:27,533
[Nancy]<i> Make sure your heroine</i>

658
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:32,890
<i>presto, she finds another card
to pull out of her sleeve.</i>

659
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,542
Screw New York.
I'm over those idiots.

660
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,962
I'm self-publishing

[Gary]
<i>That's super-brave, Nancy.</i>

662
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,401
<i>I mean, wow, you gotta remember
what that means.</i>

663
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,723
It means I'm the captain
of my own ship.

664
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,818
It also disqualifies you
from entering the crystal Rose.

665
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,655
Like I give a damn about
winning some dumb-ass contest.

666
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,415
[Frances] Okay, but you know,

667
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,642
once you take that step,
there's no taking it back.

668
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:03,311
Agents and publishers
won't go near you

669
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,756
<i>unless the book's already
a big hit on itS own.</i>

670
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:06,907
[Daniel] Too much...

671
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,576
Not enough...

672
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,221
And Goldilocks said,
"just right."

673
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:16,249
I've got four words for you...

674
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,828
Fifty, shades, of, Grey.

675
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,513
Started out self-published,

676
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,999
and how fast did vintage books
come crawling?

677
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:25,017
Huh?

678
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:29,095
How's this for the blurb?

679
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,007
[Daniel] "The story of a man
who thinks he's in charge,

680
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,284
and the woman who really is."

681
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:37,846
It's awesome, Nancy.

682
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:39,864
Awesome is nothing
without five-star reviews.

683
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,775
They'll come.

684
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,945
Corn bread
and homemade BlackBerry jam?

685
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,365
If you're makin" it,
I'm eatin' it.

686
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,975
[Ringing]

687
00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:01,219
Hey, Nance.

688
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,462
Hey, Mark!

689
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:03,388
How's it going down there?

690
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,131
<i>[Sighs]</i>

691
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,316
<i>I fell off the wagon.</i>

<i>Bad.</i>

693
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,396

695
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:16,165
<i>I'm afraid to go see my doctor.</i>

696
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,496
Mark, I'm so sorry.

697
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:20,791
<i>But that's not
why you're calling.</i>

698
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,241
It's just, I'm publishing
my book online,

699
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:25,393
and, you know,
it's all about the algorithm...

700
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:26,819
How many stars you get.

701
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,230
So, if I send the link,
could you...?

702
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:29,822
<i>Count on me for a rave.</i>

703
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,008
Thank you, and bless you...

704
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,509
And call that doctor!

705
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,244
[Merrill]
<i>Things were good, Mrs. Brophy?</i>

706
00:33:42,262 --> 00:33:44,262
No big changes in your life?

707
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:45,856
<i>You and Mr. Brophy were happy?</i>

708
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,433
It's like
everybody always told me...

709
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:50,769
I was the luckiest girl alive.

710
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,271
And then we'll have
the treasurer's report,

711
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:54,923
and I know Sandra's

712
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,683
supposed to share a new chapter
of "Saratoga spring" with us,

713
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:58,927
but first, if there are
any announcements,

714
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:00,704
now's the time...

And when you got here,

896
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:53,385
the student you spoke to

897
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,129
filled you in on what happened?

898
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:56,275
The shooting,
how the body was found,

899
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:57,723
all that?

900
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,862
<i>No, I just got here, and...</i>

901
00:42:58,968 --> 00:43:00,076
Why are you asking?

902
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:01,911
Oh, no reason, just...

903
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:03,818
You know, you didn't ask
about any of that.

904
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:06,786
[Man on phone]
<i>I hope it's nothing serious.</i>

905
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,585
Oh, no, thank you,
he'll be fine.

906
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:10,069
It's just, you know,

907
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:14,148
working two jobs has been
taking a terrible physical toll.

908
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,258
So we're hoping

909
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:18,094
for a slight reduction
in the mortgage payment,

910
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,245
just till Daniel's
back up to speed.

911
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,764
<i>How much of a reduction
would help?</i>

912
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,326
[Nancy] Like $300?

913
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:27,011
- Would that work?
<i>- Yes, no problem.</i>

914
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:28,771
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

915
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:30,348
Bless you.

916
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
- Bye now.
<i>- Bye.</i>

917
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:43,268
I've only got a half-hour

918
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,455
before I trudge off
to my night job.

919
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:48,349
Can this paperwork wait?

920
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:50,793
Just one quick autograph
and I'm out of your hair.

921
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:52,945
Don't we already have insurance?

922
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,039
Investment value.

923
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,757
Beats the heck
out of the stock market.

924
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,764
Doesn't the investment
only pay off when I'm dead?

925
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:06,581
Well, you'd want me
taken care of, wouldn't you?

926
00:44:07,704 --> 00:44:08,811
Yeah.

927
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:13,057
Yeah, yeah...

928
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,984
Yeah.

929
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:16,211
Okay.

930
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:18,562
[Nancy]
<i>Once your motive is locked in,</i>

931
00:44:18,715 --> 00:44:20,315
<i>the question
turns to choice of weapon.</i>

932
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:24,235
I was thinking...

933
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:28,890
Braised endive
and roast duck with cherries,

934
00:44:28,908 --> 00:44:32,669
but all I've got the will for
is grilled steak.

935
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:34,087
I hope that's okay?

936
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:37,899
[Nancy]<i> Stabbing?</i>

937
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:39,228
<i>Only if you want to get
close enough</i>

938
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:41,344
<i>for them to stab you,</i>

939
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:42,639
<i>and who's going to clean up
all that blood?</i>

940
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:44,681
<i>Y-o-u, that's who.</i>

941
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:56,442
Whoa, you're hitting
a tipping point here, Nancy.

942
00:44:58,254 --> 00:44:59,178
Between what and what?

943
00:44:59,272 --> 00:45:00,755
Well, you've got, like,

944
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:02,423
eight life-insurance
policies already?

945
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:04,011
If you put the money
you're paying in premiums

946
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,535
into something here and now...

947
00:45:05,686 --> 00:45:08,037
Bonds, blue-chip stocks,
anything...?

948
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:10,022
You and Daniel would be
on a whole lot solider ground.

949
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,042
You know
what lousy savers we are.

950
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:15,712
If it's premiums we have to pay,
we don't have a choice.

951
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:17,955
Nance.

952
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,123
What?

953
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:19,941
I'm really worried about you.

954
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:22,885
I'm fine.
I'm great.

955
00:45:23,112 --> 00:45:24,203
Are you?

956
00:45:24,297 --> 00:45:25,515
Do you have any idea
how good you've got it?

957
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:26,630
A beautiful house,

958
00:45:26,783 --> 00:45:29,116
all these books
pouring out of your brain,

959
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:31,118
a husband
who can't get enough of you...

960
00:45:31,137 --> 00:45:33,879
Why not tell tomorrow
to go to hell

961
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,710
and smell the roses
right under your nose right now?

962
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,975
I've got a plan, Joe.

963
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,069
I need to stick to it.

964
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,054
[Nancy] One more John Hancock.

965
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,814
[Daniel]
Didn't I already sign this?

966
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:46,058
This one's a cash-value policy.

967
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,487
Nice, fat piggy bank
for a rainy day.

968
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:50,705
How bad is the rain?

969
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,584
Is the port view job
even helping?

970
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:56,235
I feel like my students
are getting half of me.

971
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,646
Half of you
is twice anybody else.

972
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:02,074
[Nancy]<i> There's always</i>
<i>strangling with piano wire...</i>

973
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,259
<i>A classic...</i>

974
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,345
<i>But for my taste,
a touch melodramatic.</i>

975
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:12,935
[♪♪]

976
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:24,447
[♪♪]

977
00:46:28,177 --> 00:46:29,177
[Daniel] Hey, honey!

978
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,032
How was work?

979
00:46:35,184 --> 00:46:37,018
I'm too zonked to know.

980
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:42,023
Hey, I could use
a really big favor right now.

981
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,299
Anything.

982
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,134
Feed the chickens?

983
00:46:47,454 --> 00:46:49,254
[Nancy]<i> Blow to the head</i>
<i>with a blunt object?</i>

984
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,141
<i>This would require
a cast-iron skillet</i>

985
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:54,885
<i>to be within easy reach
right when you need it.</i>

986
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:56,813
Well, I did say anything.

987
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,149
Thanks, sweetheart.

988
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:08,626
[Realtor]
Paint job's not bad, actually.

989
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,160
Better than I feared.

990
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:13,329
You might...

991
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,314
And I do say might...

992
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:18,317
Get 425 for it.

993
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,628
Only if you do something
about that nightmare backyard.

994
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:25,698
They're going to wreck it.

995
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:27,418
They're going
to make it suburban.

996
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,328
You want top dollar
for the house, don't ya?

997
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,495
What is that?

998
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,591
[Nancy] Calm down,
it's not agent orange.

999
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:36,352
It's just plain, old, everyday,
garden-variety herbicide.

1000
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,784
What if whoever buys the house
wants to grow stuff to eat?

1001
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:43,025
Don't go anywhere
near where they spray, okay?

1002
00:47:43,177 --> 00:47:44,277
Spread the word.

1003
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,530
[Nancy]<i> Poison?</i>

1004
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:49,514
<i>Not a sure thing.</i>

1005
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,609
<i>Too little? Too much?</i>

1006
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,995
<i>Your mother always told you
to marry a doctor.</i>

1007
00:47:55,765 --> 00:47:56,831
<i>Now you know why.</i>

1008
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,048
Answer on the re-fi.

1009
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,199
I've been trying
to get a better rate.

1010
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:19,803
Everything okay?

1011
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,622
Totally.

1012
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:23,268
You know, if we're going
to your parents',

1013
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:24,716
we probably should get
our Santa hats on,

1014
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,143
don't you think?

1015
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:27,978
I called and begged off.

1016
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:29,388
I gotta get to port view.

1017
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:30,222
They got me on the night shift.

1018
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:31,908
On Christmas Eve?

1019
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,484
Pays double time...

1020
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:34,947
But I've got a surprise
for you, sweetheart.

1021
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,078
Yeah?

1022
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,155
I know how hard you work

1023
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,141
and how much you long
for faraway places,

1024
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,209
so I got you something
I know you're gonna love.

1025
00:48:44,238 --> 00:48:47,423
My Christmas present
to you is...

1026
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:48,574
Drum roll, please?

1027
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:52,595
A getaway...

1028
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:53,930
To Portugal.

1029
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:57,928
I got the tickets right here.

1030
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,354
Portuguese national dish.

1031
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,431
It's spelled "linguica",

1032
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,118
but it's pronounced
"link-Ee-kah",

1033
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,839
which is probably
why they call sausages "links",

1034
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:20,439
now that I think of it.

1035
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,275
Lisbon on a plate,

1036
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,110
and this way,

1037
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,021
the pork gets the jet lag,
not us!

1038
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,884
I'll grill 'em up real quick
before I take off, okay?

1039
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,008
[Nancy]
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>

1040
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:37,807

00:49:38,034 --> 00:49:39,141
<i>than the obvious.</i>

1042
00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:40,534
<i>The gold standard.</i>

1043
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:42,061
<i>The sure thing.</i>

1044

[♪♪]

1045
00:49:57,811 --> 00:50:00,913
[♪♪]

1046
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:15,085
[♪♪]

1047
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,587
Did Daniel own any kind of gun?

1048
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:18,072
Because that might indicate

1049
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:19,445
he was under
some kind of threat,

1050
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,258
which could lead us
to a suspect.

1051
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,910
[Nancy]
We most certainly do own a gun!

1052
00:50:22,928 --> 00:50:25,929
Everybody was all, "ooh..."
After that shooting in Florida.

1053
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:27,523
- Parkland.
- That's the one.

1054
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:28,916
I kind of surveyed people,

1055
00:50:28,934 --> 00:50:32,010
and it turned out
everybody had a gun except us,

1056
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,921
so I went down and bought one,

1057
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:35,531
and here's the very thing,

1058
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:37,562
when I got it home,
neither one of us wanted it.

1059
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:38,850
And it's still in my closet,

1060
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,110
and it still has

1061
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,429
the little plastic band
around the trigger thing,

1062
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:44,206
and we never even
bought bullets for it!

1063
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:45,458
You bought the gun when?

1064
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,937
Oh, way back.

1065
00:50:49,955 --> 00:50:50,938
Christmas.

1066
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:52,364
Christmas?

1067
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,365
You're certain of that?

1068
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:54,717
Yes. I was celebrating.

1069
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:57,961
Wasn't parkland
a couple of months later,

1070
00:50:58,114 --> 00:50:58,888

1072
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,558

1073

Hmm...

1076
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,502
Not too much kickback in this?

1077
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,654
Just enough
to show you've got some power.

1078
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:43,415
Bit of practice,
it'll get like swatting a fly.

1079
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,842
Sounds great.

1080
00:51:44,994 --> 00:51:47,010
So, I'm a romance novelist,

1081
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:49,087
and I'm buying the gun

1082
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,941
so I get the details right
in something I'm writing.

1083
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:54,092
Glamorous!

1084
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,502
Would I have read
any of your books?

1085
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,354
Maybe not yet,
but you will someday.

1086
00:51:57,506 --> 00:51:59,006
So, I have this idea

1087
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,652
that instead of the character
hiding the gun,

1088
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:04,695
they're like, "hey, police,
I have a gun, look, here it is!"

1089
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,825
Which would totally
throw them off the scent, right?

1090
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:08,106
Totally.

1091
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,183
So, is there a way

1092
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:10,942
the character
can clean their gun

1093
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:11,702
so it's like it was never used?

1094
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:15,614
Actually, no,

1095
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:17,836
but if your killer was smart,
there's one thing he could do.

1096
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,134
She.

1097
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:20,544
Even better.

1098
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,029
After she fires the gun,

1099
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:24,531
she swaps out the SLIde
and the barrel

1100
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,700
for the same parts
of the same model?

1101
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:27,792
Presto.

1102
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:28,978

1200
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:48,522
And the wagon master
was a cruel and wicked man,

1201
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,874
who would seize young girls
from the campfire,

1202
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,693
bring them to his wagon,

1203
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:54,636

with them...

1205
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:58,365
she smashed
his bottle of whiskey

1206

and stabbed him
with this jagged edge.

1207
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:03,370
And the pioneers
left him on the trail

1208
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:04,963
with the shard of glass
that killed him

1209

01:10:14,694 --> 01:10:16,134
I heard about
a shooting on the news.

1425
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,214
Oh, Mrs. Brophy?

1426
01:10:20,775 --> 01:10:21,775
It was...

1427
01:10:26,281 --> 01:10:27,705
Mrs. Brophy?

1428
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,206
I'm detective posey
with the ppd.

1429
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,375
This is detective Merrill.

1430
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,042
We know this is
a terrible moment for you,

1431
01:10:32,136 --> 01:10:33,136
but if it's all right,

1432
01:10:33,288 --> 01:10:34,688
we'd like to ask you
some questions.

1433
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,855
Whatever you need.

1434
01:10:39,294 --> 01:10:40,460
And the gun you bought
is where now?

1435
01:10:40,478 --> 01:10:42,128
Oh, it's at home.

1436
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:43,532
I don't even know
how to get rid of it

1437
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:46,482
because Oregon has an ordinance
about gun dealers,

1438
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,150
so I can't sell it, you know?

1439
01:10:48,303 --> 01:10:49,303
Would you like to see it?

1440
01:10:50,805 --> 01:10:52,062
That would be great.

1441
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:54,082
I can have a detective
meet you at your home, as...

1442
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:55,141
As soon as we're done here,

1443
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:55,975
and he can take it
into evidence.

1444
01:10:55,994 --> 01:10:56,994
Terrific.

1445
01:11:01,483 --> 01:11:03,316
You know...

1446
01:11:03,409 --> 01:11:06,076
Even if you find who shot him,

1447
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,290
that won't bring him back...

1448
01:11:08,656 --> 01:11:09,913
and I want him back.

1449
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,749
That's what I want.
I don't care about who shot him.

1450
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,916
I want him back.

1451
01:11:13,011 --> 01:11:15,103
We'll get through this
as quick as we can,

1452
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,930
and you can go be
with your family, okay?

1453
01:11:17,999 --> 01:11:19,679
I just want to thank you
for your Patience.

1454
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,945
Well, it's not like
I was doing anything else.

1455
01:11:26,174 --> 01:11:27,240
Hmm.

1456
01:11:29,677 --> 01:11:30,768
[Sighs]

1457
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:33,621
Check it out.
Never been fired.

1458
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:36,708
Thank you, Mrs. Brophy.

1459
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:39,611
[Phone rings]

1460
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:41,187
Beniga here.

1461
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:42,964
You with Mrs. Brophy now?

1462
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:44,835
Yeah, just turning
the glock into evidence.

1463
01:11:44,859 --> 01:11:45,859
While you're there,

1464
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:46,301
could you get
some pictures of her Van?

1465
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,969
The Sienna.

1466
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:50,973
Everything all right?

1467
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,549
Everything's fine.

1468
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:54,803
I'll check in with you later.

1469
01:11:56,387 --> 01:11:57,645
That was detective Merrill.

1470
01:11:57,872 --> 01:11:59,458
He just wants me to take
a couple pictures of your Van

1471
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,297
while I'm still here.

1472
01:12:00,391 --> 01:12:01,799
Why do you need to do that?

1473
01:12:01,893 --> 01:12:03,151
I wasn't downtown this morning.

1474
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:04,378
It's just procedure.

1475
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,010
You know
where that Van might be?

1476
01:12:33,332 --> 01:12:34,240
[Trevin]
So, the school gets a call

1477
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:35,666
from a horse farm down in Salem.

1478
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,168
They're having a mushroom issue,

1479
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,428
and my dad drives down there,

1480
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:44,250
and walks into
this pasture of morel heaven,

1481
01:12:44,268 --> 01:12:45,342
and the horse guy says,

1482
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:46,586
"we're worried

1483
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:48,007
the horses might eat them
and get sick,"

1484
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,256
and my dad says,

1485
01:12:50,349 --> 01:12:51,941
"well, I'm a chef,
not a veterinarian,

1486
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,259
but if you want,

1487
01:12:53,277 --> 01:12:55,203
I can take them
off your hands for you."

1488
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,496
[Chuckling]

1489
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,190
Share some brophyisms!

1490
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,785
Oh, there's so many of them...

1491
01:13:02,937 --> 01:13:05,454
"Every mushroom is edible...

1492
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:06,455
Once."

1493
01:13:06,608 --> 01:13:07,608
Oh, I know that one!

1494
01:13:09,535 --> 01:13:12,628
Everybody, this is Nancy Brophy,

1495
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,964
better known around here as...

1496
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:16,224
Management!

1497
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,954
[Nancy] He lived a happy life.

1498
01:13:22,047 --> 01:13:24,807
He loved teaching,
he loved mushrooms,

1499
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:26,025
he loved his family.

1500
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:29,737
He was one of the few people
I've ever known

1501
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:31,739
who did exactly
what he wanted in life

1502
01:13:31,966 --> 01:13:32,966
and loved doing it.

1503
01:13:34,652 --> 01:13:38,913
For him, not only was life
a science project,

1504
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,706
but sometimes,
it was an adventure.

1505
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,233
I love you all,

1506
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:44,710
and thank you for being here.

1507
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:47,744
[Karen] We love you, Nancy.

1508
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:02,687

1509
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:13,573

[Dialing]

1512
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,453
<i>Atlantic horizons?</i>

1513
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:37,638
Hi, it's Nancy Brophy...

1514
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,500
How can they do this, Joe?

1515
01:14:42,537 --> 01:14:44,461
You have to admit,
it makes sense.

1516
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:45,607
If you were
an insurance company,

1517
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:48,207
and somebody you covered
was murdered,

1518
01:14:48,226 --> 01:14:50,042
would you pay out the policy
until you found out who did it?

1519
01:14:50,061 --> 01:14:53,045
It was probably some vagrant
who's in Timbuktu by now.

1520
01:14:53,064 --> 01:14:55,305
What about the $80,000 policy
at greenfield?

1521
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:56,382
They'll give you

1522
01:14:56,475 --> 01:14:57,528
the same answer
as all the others.

1523
01:14:57,552 --> 01:14:59,327
[Phone alert chimes]

1524
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,167
What's wrong?

1525
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:08,410
You want to do me
an enormous favor, Joe?

1526
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:09,587
Tell me what isn't?

1527
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:16,827
So...

1528
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,255
Ooh, nice big windows
for some morning sunshine.

1529
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,516
Ah, and a stainless-steel stove.

1530
01:15:21,743 --> 01:15:22,850
That's good.

1531
01:15:23,002 --> 01:15:24,927
All the young couples
have to have that or die.

1532
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,078
Room for a pool,

1533
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:28,764
once we get
that mess cleared out.

1534
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:30,525
Look, you have got
wonderful bones here.

1535
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:32,418
I'm glad that we're on
the radar,

1536
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:36,589
but with the broken tiles
and the bad plumbing,

1537
01:15:36,607 --> 01:15:38,068
we're months away
from anybody biting.

1538
01:15:38,092 --> 01:15:39,700
I don't have months.

1539
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,597
I'm sorry, but in real estate,

1540
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:45,970
Patience is
the name of the game.

1541
01:15:47,451 --> 01:15:48,709
I'll be in touch.

1542
01:16:07,305 --> 01:16:08,305
Trevin?

1543
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:10,731
Yeah?

1544
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:11,732
Could you take
Daniel's chickens away, please?

1545
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:13,568
Absolutely.

1546
01:16:15,813 --> 01:16:17,313
I know how hard it must be.

1547
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,647
Like, he's still here,

1548
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,640
and he's about to go hang out
with his buddies.

1549
01:16:24,396 --> 01:16:27,397
I'll make some calls,
find a good home for them.

1550
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,992
I mean today.
In your truck. Now.

1551
01:16:30,144 --> 01:16:30,976
Just take them away, please.

1552
01:16:30,995 --> 01:16:32,235
Of course, Nancy.

1553
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,255
I'll go herd them up right now.

1554
01:16:39,003 --> 01:16:40,386
I miss grandpa.

1555
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,491
She's on her way to Texas.

1556
01:16:45,509 --> 01:16:46,750
For her brother's funeral.

1557
01:16:46,844 --> 01:16:49,161
It's a little too close
to Mexico for my taste.

1558
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,013
Okay, she bought a gun,

1559
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,387
but you say yourself it's clean.

1560
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,591
She also bought
an extra SLIding clip on eBay.

1561
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,517
Which you haven't found.

1562
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:57,169
Yet...

1563
01:16:57,188 --> 01:16:59,839
And a million and a quarter
in insurance on the deceased.

1564
01:16:59,932 --> 01:17:01,151
Did she also have
insurance on herself?

1565
01:17:01,175 --> 01:17:02,341
Yes.

1566
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,843
Defense can build
a whole case on that.

1567
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:05,344
Her Van was at the scene.

1568
01:17:05,363 --> 01:17:06,528
Could have been stolen.

1569
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:07,991
Okay, come on.
The cell phone pings back it up.

1570
01:17:08,015 --> 01:17:09,606
Her phone could have been
in the car

1571
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:10,626
when the killer took it.

1572
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:12,534
You know juror #5,

1573
01:17:12,687 --> 01:17:14,353
in the back row?

1574
01:17:14,372 --> 01:17:15,779
The one who hates cops?

1575
01:17:15,873 --> 01:17:16,873
There's not enough here

1576
01:17:16,949 --> 01:17:18,168
to convince him or her
to convict.

1577
01:17:18,192 --> 01:17:19,449
You can hook up with Austin,

1578
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,629
have them keep an eye on her,

1579
01:17:20,711 --> 01:17:21,831
but I'm not ready to indict.

1580
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:32,629
[Judge] First of all,

1581
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,315
my sympathies to both of you

1582
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:36,984
on the death of your brother
and husband.

1583
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:42,731
In the matter
of the conflicting wills,

1584
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,660
I am first going to address
the earlier one,

1585
01:17:45,887 --> 01:17:47,736
dated two years ago,

1586
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,556
and submitted to this court
by Jennifer crampton.

1587
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,501
This one begins,
as wills customarily do,

1588
01:17:53,652 --> 01:17:55,911
with pages
of rather dull material.

1589
01:17:56,063 --> 01:17:57,821
Appointment of fiduciaries,

1590
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,581
identification of family trust,

1591
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:01,967
before disposition of assets
is arrived at.

1592
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,330
I will now read the will

1593
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:12,094
submitted by the sister
of the deceased, Nancy Brophy,

1594
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,523
dated two days
before Mr. Crampton's death.

1595
01:18:18,677 --> 01:18:20,155
"I am currently married
to Jennifer crampton,

1596
01:18:20,179 --> 01:18:22,421
however, I have
no intention or desire

1597
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:27,017
of leaving any of my property
to her under this will."

1598
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,369
Moving on from

1599
01:18:28,596 --> 01:18:29,762
the grammatically
problematic use

<i>this is the third time
I'm calling</i>

1613
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:16,158
<i>to ask when you're going
to collect your brother's ashes.</i>

1614
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:17,826
As you've prevented us

1615
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:19,920
from contacting
the wife of the deceased,

1616
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:21,647
you'll need to let us know

1617
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,020
where you'd like us
to send them.

1618
01:19:23,985 --> 01:19:24,985
Please call me back.

1620
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,608
The widow Brophy just called.

1621
01:19:42,853 --> 01:19:44,253
She wants to come in
and talk to us.

1622
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,188
You think she's ready to break?

1623
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:56,714
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Brophy.

1624
01:19:57,518 --> 01:19:59,018
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother.

1625
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:00,702
Yeah, well,
he's out of pain now.

1626
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:01,854
I'm thankful for that,

1627
01:20:01,872 --> 01:20:04,614
and that's actually
why I came in,

1628
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:07,192
because the reason
I stayed so long in Texas

1629
01:20:07,286 --> 01:20:09,303
is because I was finding out
who killed Daniel.

1630
01:20:12,383 --> 01:20:14,141
- Really?
- Yes.

1631
01:20:14,368 --> 01:20:16,048
We'll be recording this,
if you don't mind.

1632
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:17,886
Of course.

1633
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:19,814
You see, my sister-in-law

1634
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,276
found out that Mark
was going to change his will

1635
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,559
and leave his money to me,

1636
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:26,895
so she hired a gangster
in the Vietnamese mafia

1637
01:20:27,048 --> 01:20:27,713
to kill me and Dan,

1638
01:20:27,731 --> 01:20:29,381
so we couldn't inherit,

1639
01:20:29,474 --> 01:20:31,066
but the killer got scared off

1640
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,052
by all the snooping around
you guys were doing,

1641
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:34,644
and never got around to me.

1642
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:35,830
So that's who did it,

1643
01:20:36,057 --> 01:20:38,223
and I know you guys
can take it from there.

1644
01:20:38,242 --> 01:20:39,983
Well, thanks for the tip.

1645
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,002
We'll get right on that.

1646
01:20:41,153 --> 01:20:42,670
No, thank you.

1647
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:47,324
Oh, there was one other thing.

1648
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,751
I don't want to be
the stupid question of the day,

1649
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:52,046
but I think I need to be
the stupid question of the day.

1650
01:20:52,406 --> 01:20:54,849
Okay...

1651
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,851
So, this friend of mine
was asking

1652
01:20:57,002 --> 01:20:59,687
how does somebody know
they're no longer a suspect,

1653
01:20:59,838 --> 01:21:01,914
in terms of, you know,
life insurance,

1654
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:03,415
and I was saying,
well, I just don't know,

1655
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:07,010
and somebody else said
I could get a letter from you,

1656
01:21:07,104 --> 01:21:08,362
saying I'm not a suspect.

1657
01:21:14,686 --> 01:21:16,328
Why would you need
something like that?

1658
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,948
Because they don't want to pay

1659
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,358
if it turns out

1660
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,412
that I secretly was
the one who shot my husband.

1661
01:21:22,436 --> 01:21:24,527
You know?

1662
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,547
Yeah.

1663
01:21:25,773 --> 01:21:27,530
I mean, it's just
a stupid, little policy.

1664
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:28,550
It's nothing,

1665
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,958
just like $40,000,

1666
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:32,553
and I asked what happens
if it never gets resolved,

1667
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:33,704
and the answer is,

1668
01:21:33,797 --> 01:21:35,631
then it has to be evaluated,

1669
01:21:35,783 --> 01:21:37,040
which could take forever.

1670
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,727
Yeah, well, we never
would do something like that.

1671
01:21:39,878 --> 01:21:41,470
I knew you would say that.

1672
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:43,397
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's never been done.

1673
01:21:43,624 --> 01:21:45,983
I've... I've never heard
of that being done.

1674
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,053
Well, okay then!

1675
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,554
Thank you for your time.

1676
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,890
Just a little thing
I wanted to check on.

1677
01:21:53,984 --> 01:21:55,651

How much did you say
he was he insured for?

1681
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:03,475
A million and a quarter,

1682
01:22:03,568 --> 01:22:04,712
but we found more since then.

1683
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:05,776
It's a million and a half.

turned the water on in his.

if the pipes even work anymore.

kitchen stuff.

Haven't picked up
a single one of his knives.

1692
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:31,170
he'll just pop up
and cut my throat!

We wouldn't dream of asking any.

1734

No, we just want to make

<i>Gotta hand it to you
for creativity.</i>

1740

But you know,

1741
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:11,787
somehow, you just didn't
fully work things out, did ya?

1742
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:13,196
It all comes down to...

1743
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,882
What's the word?

1744
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:15,957

but things still
have to make basic sense.

01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:21,925
the SLIde and clip on the gun
you shoot somebody with,

1749
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:23,390
but not so smart to buy

1750
01:24:23,617 --> 01:24:25,111
the extra parts
on your own eBay account.

1751
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:27,119
I bought all that for research.

1752
01:24:27,212 --> 01:24:28,044
For a novel I was writing.

1753
01:24:28,138 --> 01:24:31,306
So, for research...
As you say...

1754
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,733
You needed to buy

1755
01:24:32,884 --> 01:24:33,883
two identical parts
of the same gun?

1756
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:35,569
And good move
to delete the account,

1757
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,131
but if you were writing this
for one of your books,

1758
01:24:39,149 --> 01:24:39,981
don't you think

1759
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:41,483
the character would know

1760
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,059
that deleting something
doesn't erase it from the cloud?

1761
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,227
And most of all, Mrs. Brophy,

1762
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:47,397
if you're going
to murder your husband,

1763
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:48,916
it may not be the best idea

1764
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:51,307
to write a blog post called
"how to murder your husband".
