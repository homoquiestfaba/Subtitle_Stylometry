1
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,351
Hmm.

2
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,897
Hmm!

3
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,149
I think I outdid myself
with this one.

4
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,279
Thank you for agreeing with me.

5
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,662
Oh. Hi, there!
Welcome to Chloe's Cakes!

6
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,249
- What can I get you fellas?
- I'm looking for the owner,
Ms. Chloe Donner.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,126
Well, that is me.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,754
- Hello, my name is Jeb.
- Hi, Jeb. I'm Chloe.

9
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,423
- I work in the city
for Landmark Real Estate.
- Mmm-hmm.

10
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,592
You have 30 days
to vacate these premises.

11
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,137
No.

12
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,224
No. That can't be right.
You're evicting me
at Christmas?

13
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,727
This building
is being repurposed to
maximize financial positions.

14
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,104
Look, it's nothing personal,
it's just...

15
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,401
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

16
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,571
That's okay,
I will just take it back.

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,450
Yeah.

18
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,331
No, that can't be right.
You're evicting me at...

19
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,917
- I'm Sorry!
- Oh, dude! What?

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,460
Oh, my God.

21
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,087
Okay, let's cut!

22
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,463
That's a cut.

23
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,799
What is this guy,
allergic to Christmas?

24
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,510
I need a block.

25
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,639
Want me to handle it?

26
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,891
No, I got it.

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,560
All right, everybody, take five!

28
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,735
Hey, are you all right?

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm sorry.
I'm allergic to dogs.

30
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,950
Daniel?

31
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:43,204
It is specifically noted
in the casting call:
no dog allergies.

32
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,415
I really needed this job.

33
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,878
- All right. Can we get you
an allergy pill or something?
- I took two already.

34
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,048
Okay, take a break. And...

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,717
Bless you.

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,469
Get a snack
at the craft services table.

37
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,513
And we'll use you later.

38
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,597
I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,058
Thank you.

40
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,810
- Um, Jessica?
- Yes.

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,854
- I have a quick question.
- Sure.

42
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,815
When Zooey barks,
how do I know
what she's saying?

43
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,652
You don't actually.

44
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,113
Okay, so,
I don't speak dog language?

45
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:22,201
It's more like Zooey
reflects your inner feelings
back to you.

46
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,370
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

47
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,872
So, she's a psychic dog?

48
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,539
Um...

49
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,960
Yeah.

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,588
She is a little bit psychic.

51
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,008
- That's wild.
- Right?

52
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,259
Okay, cool.

53
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,427
Okay, let's try this again.

54
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,179
Wow.

55
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,727
Back to one, everyone!

56
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,396
Wait. Jeb needs three lawyers
with him.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,565
- It'll work with two.
- It needs to be three.

58
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,322
- Sorry.
- Okay. You! Go outside!

59
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,282
You!

60
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,994
Come fill in here.

61
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,332
- Me?
- Yes, come on.

62
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,167
- Let's go.
- You want me to... What?

63
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,211
- What's your name?
- I'm Christopher.

64
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,380
Christopher,
are you allergic to dogs?

65
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,924
-No.
-Great.
You're in the scene now.

66
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,384
- Come on.
- Okay.

67
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,928
I'll hold these.
Let's get you in there.

68
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,515
So, you follow those guys,
Christopher. You are
one of the lawyers now.

69
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,308
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,786
I always thought
I'd be a good lawyer.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,020
Let's put a pin in that,
and just...

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,648
break a leg.

73
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,293
Costumes, can we
have the jacket flown in
for our new lawyer, please.

74
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,403
Let's make this happen, people.

75
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,446
Thank you.

76
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,496
Oh, no, don't do that...
Yeah, just blend into
the background, yeah.

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,457
Okay, new guy.

78
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,502
Yeah, okay, over here.
So, this is how
it's gonna work.

79
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,379
He's gonna open the door.

80
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,049
You're going to file in fourth,
and you're going
to land back left.

81
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,217
- Cool.
- You clear?

82
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,720
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

83
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,930
Clear the set.

84
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,807
Everyone in first positions.

85
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,517
Ready, Jess?

86
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,228
Call it, Daniel.

87
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,189
Roll sound! Roll camera!

88
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,315
Rolling.

89
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,446
Scene three. Take two. Mark.

90
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,323
Action.

91
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,884
Reena?

92
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,928
- Right here.
- How many singers do we have
for the caroling scene?

93
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,765
I asked Daniel for 12
like you said, so we got six.

94
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,848
Perfect.

95
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,645
I sent you my notes
on the bakery logo, Cooper.

96
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,731
I got them.
Uh, making the changes.

97
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,098
Excuse me, Jessica?

98
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,477
Lawyer guy. Christopher, right?

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,229
Did you not get your chips back?

100
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,314
I grabbed another bag.

101
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,400
Great. Well, thanks
for jumping in there.
The second AD can sign you out.

102
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,823
Oh.
I'm not an extra.

103
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,158
Well, you weren't the lead.

104
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,412
No, I just started working with
the network. I came by the set
today to introduce myself.

105
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,749
Oh.

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,001
I'm sorry, I...

107
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,671
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

108
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,631
What?
And miss out on my big break?

109
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,176
Sorry.
Uh, it's just, you know,
the suit, kind of, threw me.

110
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,803
But it's really nice
to meet you.

111
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,929
You too.

112
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,811
Oh, and I'm supposed
to tell you we're shutting down
the Christmas Movie division.

113
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,650
That is a funny joke,
Christopher. You do make
a good lawyer.

114
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,279
I'm afraid it's not a joke.

115
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,867
What? Uh...

116
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,704
Does Kelly know about this?

117
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,789
She's no longer
with the company.

118
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,627
-What about Steven?
-He's moved on, also.
Theresa is in charge now.

119
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,423
-Who's Theresa?
-It's a whole new team.
Massive shake-up.

120
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:50,595
Geez. You guys should
really think about putting out
a newsletter or something.

121
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,806
The market is dominated by
the two "Christmas channels."

122
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,058
It's not a financial win
for us to compete,

123
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,269
so we're trying
a whole new direction
for programming.

124
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,229
- Which is?
- Thrillers, mostly.

125
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,666
Women in peril,
ripped-from-the-headlines,
that kind of thing.

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,360
So, you want the cupcake girl
to be abducted by terrorists?

127
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,738
That's actually
a really good idea.

128
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,116
- I have a contract for three
more Christmas movies.
- Not with the new team.

129
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
Everyone loves Christmas movies.

130
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,208
Do they? Aren't they all
a little predictable?

131
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,420
That's a feature, not a bug.
That's the whole point
of Christmas movies.

132
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,503
Tell him, Reena.

133
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,676
Big city boy
meets small town girl,
they have conflict.

134
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,013
Small town charm wins out
over the cruel unfeeling
corporate world.

135
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,808
The lovers use Christmas magic
to save the day
and fall hopelessly in love.

136
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,482
Oh, and, if he's secretly
a prince, it's a double whammy.

137
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,545
Aren't you bored
just talking about it?

138
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,779
It's not boring,
it's comforting.

139
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,281
It's curling up
with a cup of hot cocoa

140
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,117
or snuggling in front of
a fire on a snowy night.

141
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,954
- Are those things
boring to you?
- Those things are simple.

142
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,456
That's why they're comforting.
Our movies need to be complex.

143
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,893
They need to have layers.
They need to surprise
the audience.

144
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,586
This is my brand, Christopher.

145
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,755
I'm good at this.

146
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,592
Do you know how hard it is
for a female director to build
a reputation in this town?

147
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,970
I'm gonna finish this movie
on my terms,

148
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,781
because apparently after this,
I'm out of a job,

149
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,783
because some suits don't
believe in Christmas magic.

150
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,602
Christmas magic is like snow
in LA. There's no such thing.

151
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,398
Okay. Thank you
for the heads up.

152
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,235
We can talk more
about it tomorrow if you want.

153
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,907
- What's tomorrow?
- It's day two, right?

154
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,451
I'm going to be on set
for all of production.

155
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,328
That's not necessary.

156
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,223
The network wanted me
to keep a close eye
on the budget spend.

157
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,582
I guess some
of their recent movies
went way over.

158
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,502
I'm from finance.
Numbers are kinda my thing.

159
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,338
Well, making movies
is kinda my thing.

160
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,632
But you can't make movies
without money.

161
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,468
- Come on, we can work together.
- Super.

162
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,804
- Have you worked
on a lot of movies?
- This is my first.

163
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,806
- Lucky me.
- Oh, wait.

164
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,476
If I had some ideas
about the script? Do I talk
to you about those, or...

165
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,062
Let's just put a pin in that.

166
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,231
Where are you headed?

167
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,276
Oh, I'm that grey
little number out...

168
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,532
Uff.

169
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,367
Excuse me.

170
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,470
You okay?

171
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,515
Okay, that my life just
got turned upside-down?

172
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,977
No. I need a moment.

173
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,563
It's gonna work out.

174
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,566
Why are you smiling?

175
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:53,903
- This is a Christmas movie.
- Yeah, that nobody cares about.

176
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,324
Not the movie, this.
This whole thing
is a Christmas movie.

177
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,410
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,372
You're the lead, like Chloe,
trying to do this special
Christmas thing,

179
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,625
and Christopher is Jeb,
the big city hotshot,
trying to shut you down.

180
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,586
- I'm a big city hotshot, too.
- Not in this case.

181
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,589
You're the small town girl
who knows what makes
Christmas special.

182
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,925
I know how to make
Christmas movies special.

183
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,427
Same thing.

184
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,364
Well, big city hotshots
who don't know what
they're talking about

185
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,056
are not limited to Christmas.

186
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,724
- There's me too.
- You?

187
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,102
Your plucky, young sidekick
trying to talk sense into you.

188
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,561
Classic Christmas
movie character.

189
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,814
Can I trade you in
for a talking dog?

190
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,357
Not according to my contract.

191
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,692
You're missing one thing.

192
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,112
- What's that?
- It's July.

193
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,031
You can't always contain
Christmas magic to December.

194
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,141
Hey. Which way to set?

195
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,976
- Up on the left.
- Thanks.

196
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,578
So, now we have to make sure
this movie comes out perfect.

197
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,039
So, I can get the network
to reconsider Christmas movies.

198
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,499
Shouldn't be a problem.

199
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,084
Did you say there's a problem?

200
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,336
Oh, good. You're here.

201
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,380
No. There's no problem.

202
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,549
We have a problem.

203
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,885
Ashley?

204
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,345
- She doesn't wanna come to set.
- Of course, she won't.

205
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,890
- I'll go talk to her.
- Yep.

206
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,224
Yeah, we should go talk to her.

207
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,692
So, how do you wanna play this?
Good cop, bad cop?

208
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,277
No, I can handle this.

209
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,534
Hey, Ashley, hon?

210
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,995
You okay?

211
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,623
Did you see what Michael posted
on Instagram?

212
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,292
I did not.

213
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,545
My co-star hates
working with me.

214
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,589
Do you know
how many followers he has?

215
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,428
- That's not nice.
- No, it's not, and he's a jerk.

216
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,225
You know,
I think he was probably
just trying to be funny

217
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,559
and generate some likes.

218
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:35,231
At my expense?
I don't think so.

219
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,406
-Just give her some time.
She'll come around.
-There is no time.

220
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,650
Every day
is precisely planned out
from start to finish.

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,745
Every 15 minutes that goes by
is a shot lost from the movie.

222
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,080
Can't you just replace her?

223
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,791
What are you talking about?

224
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,252
Hey, if your portfolio
has a dud, you sell it,

225
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,546
buy something new,
stay on top of the market.

226
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,716
We would lose the entire day,
and we have to re-shoot
everything from yesterday.

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,302
Besides,
I don't think she's a dud.

228
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,596
- I think she's quite talented.
- Hmm.

229
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,472
Okay.

230
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,435
Do you mind if I? Thanks.

231
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,651
Hey, Ashley. It's Christopher.
I'm the network executive
on the movie.

232
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,784
Yeah?

233
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:33,247
You know it's so great
to meet you. I loved your part
on Euphoria.

234
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,084
- You saw that?
- My college roommate
actually wrote the episode.

235
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,628
- He was lucky to have you.
- Really?

236
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,672
Look,

237
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,549
between you and me,

238
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,843
you can act circles
around Michael.

239
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,303
I can see why he's so jealous.

240
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,308
- Do you think he is?
- It's kind of obvious,
isn't it?

241
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,229
Don't let a fragile male ego

242
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,524
rob you of another
incredible performance.

243
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,151
You got this.

244
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,987
Oh, my God. You're so right.

245
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,531
Wow, it is so good
to connect with you.

246
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,658
Pleasure's all mine.

247
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,204
Okay. Um.

248
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,414
I'm pretty good at this, huh?

249
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,179
Oh, yeah,
flattering an actress.
You really cracked the code.

250
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,933
Mmm-hmm. He's your antagonist,
but he's got a helpful side.

251
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
- Checks that box.
- Not now, Reena.

252
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,106
I'll be in the trailer
if you need me.

253
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,030
Okay, everyone let's get ready
to shoot this.

254
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,574
Okay, we're second away, people.

255
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,201
Just waiting on lighting.

256
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,953
Where's the dog?

257
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,039
He should be in the scene.
He's cute.

258
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,835
He's a she. And she's expensive
to have around.
So, we use her sparingly.

259
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,548
Oh, yeah, if she's expensive,
we should use her less.
Save the money.

260
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,927
You know, this was
all planned out before you
and Theresa came around, right?

261
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,804
Right, right.

262
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,186
- Okay, stop. That's so hard.
- Okay. Ready, Jess.

263
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,690
Okay, everyone, let's make
some Christmas magic.

264
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,525
Quiet on set.

265
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,069
- Roll sound.
- Speedy.

266
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,405
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

267
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,531
Is this one for me?

268
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,458
Scene 13. Take one. Mark.

269
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,170
Okay, action.

270
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,805
Coffee's here.

271
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,015
Thanks.
Will you help me over here?

272
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,102
Sure. What can I do?

273
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,439
You know,
I'm really starting
to like this town.

274
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,733
Oh, good. You're here.

275
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,903
- Is something wrong, Chloe?
- Oh, Jeb.

276
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,157
They're just not decorating
the tree the way
that they used to, and...

277
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,618
The old way was perfect.

278
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,997
- I think it looks very nice.
- Well, what do you know?

279
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,793
Well, I know the bakery
isn't making enough dough.

280
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,338
Get it? It's bakery... Dough.

281
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,800
You're closing me down
and now you're making jokes?

282
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,888
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I...
- It's not funny, because
that place is everything to me.

283
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,141
- Yeah, I shouldn't have...
- You think you are
so much better than me.

284
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,812
And that just because you're
a man, you can trash
my reputation?

285
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,317
- Because I'm a man?
- I see you. I see you.

286
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,236
And I know what you're doing,
so just back off!

287
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,748
-Yo, Jess.
Are there new pages or...?
-Cut!

288
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,917
That's a cut.
Background, back to one...

289
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,711
This is so hot.
Can you just take this, please?

290
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,924
Okay, okay, go, go.

291
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,264
- Oh! I was just trying
something new.
- I saw.

292
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,101
Okay, um,
are we allowed to improvise or?

293
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,311
I'd prefer not.

294
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,396
Oh, but I was
really feeling that.

295
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,357
- I totally saw that.
- Yeah.

296
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,859
But, you know, I just think
it's a little strong

297
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,195
for where Chole is
at this point in the story.

298
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,823
Mmm-mmm. No, no. Chloe needs
to stand up to Jeb.

299
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,785
- Okay, my question is,
are we doing the scene...
- We're doing the scene. Yes.

300
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,956
- As written. Okay?
- Yeah. That would be great.

301
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,209
Michael?
Can you give us a moment?

302
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,088
Female time... Yeah.

303
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,424
Sure.

304
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,970
I really like what you're doing.

305
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,055
Okay. Thank you. Nice!

306
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,977
But remember,
Chloe doesn't overpower Jeb
by arguing with him.

307
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,564
- No?
- No, no.

308
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,900
Chloe just has to stay true
to what she believes in.

309
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,237
- Mmm.
- That's what inspires Jeb
to have a change of heart.

310
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,826
- I think I get it, yeah.
- And, between you and me,

311
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,496
Christopher was right.
You are acting circles
around him.

312
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,125
I get it!

313
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,085
- Let's try it again, yeah?
- Okay.

314
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,545
- Okay.
- Okay.

315
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,629
Wardrobe.

316
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,755
Last looks.

317
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,734
- Why don't you
just go talk to him?
- This is better. Trust me.

318
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,447
How long do we give him?

319
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,991
As long as it, and he's doing
such amazing work.

320
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,244
Oh, hey.
I was just talking about you.

321
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,371
- Can I walk with you?
- Sure.

322
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,542
So, I really love the tension
between your character,
Jeb, and Chloe.

323
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,295
- I can really feel it.
- Yeah, it gets
pretty intense sometimes.

324
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,799
- So I wonder if I can maybe
harness your superpowers here.
- Mine?

325
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,762
- Yeah, you have such
a natural charm and magnetism.
- Right?

326
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,933
I wonder if you could get
a little more friendly
with Ashley, off set.

327
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:30,896
Maybe you can, I don't know,
bring another aspect
to her performance.

328
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,358
Just make her feel like
you really see her, you know.

329
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,153
- I think that will help us
in the later scenes.
- For you, anything.

330
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,073
- Thank you, Michael.
- I got it, Jess.

331
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,199
Can I give you these?

332
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,909
Absolutely.

333
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,838
Come in.

334
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,513
Hey, there you are.
You kinda snuck out on me
back there.

335
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,265
- Did I?
- You know,
I have learned so much.

336
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,558
I'm so glad.

337
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,230
Um...

338
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,399
Do you wanna join me for dinner?

339
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,278
I would love to pick
your brain, get to know you
and this movie stuff better.

340
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,824
I have a lot
to prepare for tomorrow.

341
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:28,203
- But you gotta eat.
- Well, I have a bar.

342
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:31,164
- Like, with scotch?
- No, a protein bar.

343
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,875
Oh, well, that's not dinner.

344
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,711
It is, tonight.

345
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,301
- It's Reena, right?
- I'm not here.

346
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,347
Reena, what would you say
is Jessica's biggest flaw?

347
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,141
I would say
she doesn't have any.

348
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,976
That's a good answer.

349
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,229
But, really. What would
bring her to the next level?

350
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,857
I think she's doing great work.

351
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,901
Yeah, her Christmas movie work,
sure. But...

352
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,612
What's holding her back?

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,245
Well, now I'm kinda
curious myself.

354
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,751
Her perfectionism
gets in her way.

355
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,586
- Boom.
- My what?

356
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,172
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

357
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,592
- I think we're on to something
here. I think...
- You know...

358
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,511
Let's go get that dinner.

359
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,431
Great. Awesome.

360
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,517
- I will meet you on
the soundstage in ten.
- And then?

361
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,645
And then,
I'll take care of the rest.

362
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,005
- My perfectionism
gets in the way?
- That's all I could think of.

363
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,199
Why not just tell him I still
wet my bed? It would be
less embarrassing.

364
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,575
You still wet the bed?

365
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,452
No, Reena.

366
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,495
Right.

367
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,582
Now I have to get dinner
with him.

368
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,044
Right on schedule.

369
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,295
I'm sorry?

370
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,422
For the Christmas story
of all this.

371
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,306
You two get to know each other.
You see a side of him
you hadn't before.

372
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,303
He finds a new appreciation
for what you do.

373
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,473
What if I murder him at dinner?
Is that part of your
Christmas movie?

374
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,684
Then you'd be making one
of the network's thrillers.

375
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,394
That I could probably live with.

376
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,158
Christopher?

377
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,743
Yeah.
I'm right back here.

378
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,541
Honestly, I did have to
put out a few fires.

379
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,876
It's good I got here.

380
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,212
We did lose a shot.

381
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,257
No, we'll work it out.

382
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,759
Oh, hey, Jessica's here.

383
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,763
Yes. Yes, of course.

384
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,098
Okay.

385
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,726
Oh, say hi to Theresa.

386
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,689
- Hi, Theresa.
- Did you hear her?

387
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,525
Theresa says "hi."

388
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,402
- Great.
- Okay.

389
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,695
Okay, bye.

390
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,866
We got the whole place
to ourselves.

391
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,160
I didn't know this set
had a working kitchen.

392
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,954
No, one of our other movies
was serving dinner, and,

393
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,247
wait, no, they...

394
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,709
They went into second meal.

395
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,252
That's a thing, right?

396
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,588
- Yes.
- Yes.

397
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,174
- So, I grabbed these.
- Fancy.

398
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
Not bad.

399
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,596
Thank you.

400
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,226
So, Ashley seems
to be doing better.

401
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,061
She killed it today.

402
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,063
Maybe Michael is the problem.

403
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,232
Don't worry about Ashley
and Michael any more.

404
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,860
Why not?

405
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,030
It's the formula.
Boy meets girl.
They have conflict.

406
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:54,993
Christmas magic brings
them together, makes them
fall hopelessly in love.

407
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,203
Trust the formula.

408
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,874
Oh.

409
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,876
Oh, I got 'em.

410
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,298
Thank you.

411
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,178
- Hey, I liked
your ad lib today.
- Yeah. It got kind of hot.

412
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,305
- Yeah, it definitely
got intense.
- Yes.

413
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,225
- What are you, like, a Leo?
- Aries.

414
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,644
I knew it.
You're total fire sign.

415
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,604
- What are you?
- I'm a Libra.

416
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,487
-Okay, that makes sense.
We're complete opposites.
-We're complimentary!

417
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:30,070
- We're polarizing!
- We provide balance
for each other!

418
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,863
- Oh.
- Yeah.

419
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,282
It's, kind of, cold.

420
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,381
- Here you go. Nice and warm.
- Thank you.

421
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,640
Did you see my Insta post?

422
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,060
- Yeah, yeah, I did!
- It was so funny, right?

423
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,482
Yes, it was so funny.

424
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,150
- I know.
- Yes.

425
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,902
Hey, do you wanna take
a selfie with me?

426
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,613
Oh, yeah. Yes.

427
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,906
What's your good side?

428
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,783
- This one.
- I was gonna say that one.

429
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,827
Really? Oh, thank you.

430
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,120
Oh, my gosh, okay.

431
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,123
- Let's break the Internet.
- Oh, please.

432
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:31,715
- Rawr.
- Be a cat.

433
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,011
So, when you say you come
from finance,
what is that exactly?

434
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:40,015
Uh, mergers and acquisitions.
Venture capital.

435
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,225
And who it is you do that for?

436
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,436
Wherever my skills
have taken me.

437
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:49,065
Wall Street, a couple
of start-ups, a hedge fund
out of Kansas City.

438
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,359
From hedge funds to Hollywood?

439
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,321
- That's a leap.
- Not really.

440
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,156
Movies are crazy expensive.

441
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,408
To be honest,

442
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,368
I don't really know
where all the money goes.

443
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,828
We do have a budget.

444
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,623
Yeah, I was looking at that.
It is very complex.

445
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,709
I mean, there's
so many line items, but,

446
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,003
I'll figure it out.

447
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,381
But what made you choose movies
as your next job?

448
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,759
Oh, I went to
the same prep school as Carl.

449
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,843
You know Carl?

450
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,094
Lomax?

451
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,225
- The CEO of our network?
- Yeah, he's a great guy.

452
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,109
He thought I'd be a good fit
for the new team.

453
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,064
- So now you just suddenly work
at a major network?
- Yeah.

454
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,942
What Ivy League school
did you go to?

455
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,754
- What makes you think I...
- Which one?

456
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,075
- Princeton.
- Couldn't get into Harvard?

457
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,910
I did. I chose Princeton.

458
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:47,082
Yeah, okay. You don't live
in the same world
as us regular folk.

459
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,919
The world just rises up
and gifts you a place in it.

460
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,254
For the rest of us,
we have to carve out a place.

461
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,425
We have to plant our flag
and defend our land.

462
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,011
And your land
is Cupcake Christmas?

463
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,471
My land is...

464
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,516
warm, comforting,
predictable entertainment.

465
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,977
Why did you pick
Christmas movies?

466
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,703
This lady.

467
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,498
We always spent Christmas
at my Grandma Pearl's.

468
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,334
And every year, she and I
would snuggle up on the couch.

469
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,586
And binge watch
Christmas movies together.

470
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,341
I'm sure I've seen at least
a hundred of them in my life.

471
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,595
It's what made me
want to get into filmmaking.

472
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,477
Wait. Not The Godfather?
Or Citizen Kane?

473
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,314
-Oh, no. Too complex.
Too many layers.
-Ah.

474
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,817
I do this because I chose it.

475
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,655
Not just because it was
my next stop on "wherever
my skills will take me."

476
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,496
I binged watched all
of your six Christmas movies.

477
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,458
Starting with the first:
Perfectly Christmas.

478
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,169
Yep.

479
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,880
That movie put me
on the Christmas map.

480
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,050
Wow. We basically had no money.

481
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,471
I made so many mistakes.

482
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,056
But people loved it.

483
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,312
They did.

484
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,126
How are we supposed
to be able to quantify that?

485
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,904
It's not an equation,
Princeton. It's an art form.

486
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,781
Ooh. That was deep.

487
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,790
For you.

488
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,755
Where did you guys eat?
In an airplane?

489
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,345
And, how did it go?

490
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,971
It was good. Fine.

491
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,936
So that's all
you're going to say?
Did you guys hit it off?

492
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,104
Well, we're
very different people.

493
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,191
- How so?
- Well, for one thing,
he's a Princeton grad.

494
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,068
- A what?
- A Princeton...

495
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,069
- A what?
- A Prince...

496
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,654
A Prince?

497
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,949
- ton grad.
- Big city hotshot
is secretly a Prince?

498
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,785
It's a Christmas movie
double whammy!

499
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,994
That is a stretch.

500
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,956
You can't write this stuff!

501
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,459
Eventually, someone will.
Reena, can we get back
to work, please?

502
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,897
Let's go a little lighter.

503
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,942
Do you wanna do a 24 or 35?

504
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,860
- Thirty-five.
- Okay, I'm on it.

505
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,154
Let's get the dog in.

506
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,867
We have a problem.

507
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,579
So, she was in there with you...

508
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,207
I put her wardrobe on,
you know, like I usually do.

509
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,167
She was definitely fussy.

510
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,629
I was getting these vibes
from her, like, I've never
gotten before, you know.

511
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,758
- Maybe it was the vegan kibble
I gave her...
- And then?

512
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:30,138
Well, and then, I went to grab
her treats for the next scene,

513
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,724
and I turned around,
and she was gone.

514
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,476
- She was gone!
- Okay, well, she can't get off
the lot, so...

515
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,520
Wait. You think
she got off the lot?

516
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,773
No, no, no. No one's going
to let a dog dressed like
an elf off a studio lot.

517
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,818
- We need to start shooting,
Jessica.
- We gotta find Zooey first.

518
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,570
- Yes, we have to find Zooey.
- Yes.

519
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,531
Zooey! Zooey, come to me!

520
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,869
It's a dog dressed
like an elf, people.

521
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,495
Shouldn't be too hard to spot.

522
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,499
Everyone, fan out and keep
your walkies on Channel one.

523
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,252
This shouldn't take too long.
I hope not.

524
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,129
Let's do it.

525
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,090
Let's go check
with other productions.

526
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,634
Oh, good idea.

527
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,217
Yes? No?

528
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,556
Okay, thank you. Uh, well...

529
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,017
But if you do see her,
this is my cell.

530
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,769
Okay.

531
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,030
Do you think
maybe you're a jinx?

532
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,658
In what way?

533
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,761
Well, everything
that can go wrong on this movie
is going wrong,

534
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,120
and you're always around for it.

535
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,373
Hmm. That's interesting.

536
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,584
Or, these things are going
to go wrong anyway,

537
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,546
and it's great that I'm here
for it. Think about that.

538
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,048
Hey, excuse me. Have you...

539
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,966
seen a dog?

540
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,261
I'm sorry, no.

541
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,639
This isn't gonna work.

542
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,558
Wait, wait, wait.
Grease meets The Walking Dead?

543
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,560
Are you kidding me?

544
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,772
Why didn't I think of that?
Oh, I've an idea.

545
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,960
- Well?
- Okay.

546
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,672
- This is a dog call my dad used
to use on his fox hunts.
- Oh, stop.

547
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,166
Let me try it. It might work.

548
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,614
I guess Zooey isn't
a descendent
of British royalty.

549
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,824
Maybe I didn't do it right.

550
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,994
Hold on. Let's try this.

551
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,414
We can spread it far and wide.

552
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,915
Hit it, Prince Harry.

553
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,270
Sorry, your highness.

554
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,022
It wasn't a terrible idea.

555
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,524
We got the dog!

556
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,281
Okay, everyone, back to set.

557
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,827
I think a thank you is in order.

558
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,996
Why?
The walkie was my idea.

559
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,391
Yeah, but the whistle was mine.
It wouldn't have worked
without the whistle.

560
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,252
Yeah, well.
The whistle wouldn't have
worked without the walkie...

561
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,551
- I drink away too much coffee.
- You look really good.

562
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,850
- Oh, my goodness.
- Look at your little hat.

563
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,734
All right, everyone.
Let's get ready to shoot.

564
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,146
- Do we look cute together?
- You do.

565
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,148
You guys all set?

566
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,918
- Yo, Jess, can you take a photo of us, please, real quick?
- -Please.

567
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,194
- You're killing me.
- Here.

568
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,989
Hey, when my four million
followers watch this movie,
you're gonna thank me.

569
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,700
- You're gonna
thank him.
- I got it. You go.

570
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,410
Hey. Okay.

571
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,079
Count to three. One...

572
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,932
She's blocking my face.
Hang on.
She's blocking my face.

573
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,040
All right. Okay.

574
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,960
One, two, three.

575
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,212
- You guys look so beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.

576
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,006
-Okay.
-All right, everyone.
Quiet on set.

577
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,717
Say, "That's my Mommy
and Daddy."

578
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,101
How'd you know
that dog whistle thing?

579
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,895
I didn't. Christopher did.

580
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,482
- Mmm-hmm. Team work...
- Don't.

581
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,193
I will be in the trailer
if you need me.

582
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

583
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,740
Wow.

584
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,536
- Making movies is exciting.
- If you mean stressful,
then, yes, I agree.

585
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,139
You know, it's really neat
the way everyone got
on board to help.

586
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,082
It's their job.

587
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,084
Okay, everyone, quiet on set.

588
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,044
It's nothing like the world
that I come from.

589
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,963
This is cool.

590
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,719
Time to work.

591
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,679
Let's lock it up.

592
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,558
Roll sound!

593
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,810
- Roll camera!
- Rolling...

594
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,772
- Scene 28.
- Take one. Mark.

595
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,483
And... action.

596
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,154
Sprinkles, or no sprinkles?

597
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,323
That's what I was thinking.

598
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,370
And let's remember
to check on the band

599
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,955
for the Christmas
Celebration scene.

600
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,039
On it.

601
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,212
Hey, Jess.

602
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,009
Can I give you
a lift to your trailer?

603
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,470
No, it's right over there.

604
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,306
Come on. Hop in.

605
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,394
Time for a sleigh ride. Check.

606
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,987
Where to, milord?

607
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,990
Once around ye olde studio lot,
my lad.

608
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,741
Giddy up!

609
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,721
What have you done?

610
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,682
I am embracing
the Christmas movie.

611
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,684
Just had to deck out
the transport.

612
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,978
This is a lovely
golf-cart sleigh, Christopher,

613
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,647
but this is not what makes
a Christmas movie.

614
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,441
- Why not?
- Because all the things
in Christmas movies,

615
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,945
the sleigh rides, the caroling,
the tree lighting,

616
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,489
it's just the window dressing.

617
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,284
If that's all it took,
then Die Hard would be
a Christmas movie.

618
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,453
That is literally
the best Christmas movie.

619
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:16,877
Okay, well, the heart
of my Christmas movies
is the love story.

620
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,257
It's finding true love
through the magic
of the Christmas season.

621
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,968
You're saying
I spent all this money
on holly for nothing?

622
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,262
It's not holly.
It's mistletoe.

623
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,476
Maybe I should have done
a little more research.

624
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,939
Whoa!

625
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,783
I can walk from here.

626
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,995
Wait, I have an idea
for Chloe's Cupcakes.

627
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,288
Okay.

628
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,011
Okay, so, right now,
the bakery gets saved

629
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,001
because love
is the main ingredient
in the cupcakes.

630
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,046
-Did I read that right?
-You did.
It's part of the magic.

631
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,965
Okay, well,
I was just thinking,
what if, to save the bakery,

632
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,509
Chloe does
something more active?

633
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,012
- Like what?
- Like she creates
something new,

634
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,935
and then it gets more attention
for the bakery.

635
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,186
It just feels a little outside
of the formula.

636
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,106
Oh, okay.

637
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,567
Uh... Will you think about it?

638
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,651
Yeah, I will.

639
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,993
And thanks for the sleigh ride.

640
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,121
I'll see you tomorrow.

641
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,914
See you tomorrow.

642
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,543
Yippee-ki-ay!

643
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,661
Did you get my script changes?

644
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,847
Yep, props will have them ready
for this afternoon.
Not a problem.

645
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,706
Okay, great.

646
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,667
- We've got a problem.
- What is it?

647
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,711
- Someone changed the cupcakes
from the bakery scene.
- I did that.

648
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,713
You shouldn't mess
with the Christmas formula.

649
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,423
It was a note from the network.

650
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,885
Have you seen Christopher?

651
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,555
He's not here. Do you want me
to get a hold of him?

652
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,765
No. I can text him.

653
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,026
Let's do it, Daniel.

654
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,820
- Picture's up.
- Picture's up.

655
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,697
Background, to first positions.

656
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,740
Okay, everyone, quiet on set.

657
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,492
Let's get ready to shoot.

658
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,913
Roll sound.

659
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,123
Roll camera.

660
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,876
Rolling.

661
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,217
Scene 31. Take one. Mark.

662
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,139
And...

663
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,265
action.

664
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,696
Yeah, the tree looks great.

665
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,907
Um. Yeah, it does.

666
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,951
You were right
about the ornament.

667
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,537
Just because something
is different doesn't mean
it's bad.

668
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,292
And what did you hang there?

669
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,711
That's my mom.

670
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,880
She started Chloe's Cakes
20 years ago.

671
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,591
And now I'm shutting it down.

672
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,759
Yeah.

673
00:41:56,263 --> 00:42:00,017
What if you create something
new to get your bakery
more attention?

674
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,604
Hadn't really thought
about that.

675
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,235
Yeah... I wonder if, um,

676
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,571
I helped out, we could think
of something together.

677
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,450
You'd help me save my bakery?

678
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,913
I feel like I would...

679
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,916
do almost anything
to help you out, Ms. Donner.

680
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,131
There you are!

681
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,401
I've been looking
all over this crappy
little town for you!

682
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,928
Nadia, what are you doing here?

683
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,640
What? I can't surprise
my fiancé as an early
Christmas present?

684
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:41,557
Fiancé?

685
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:48,232
Uh... Yeah.

686
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,618
Uh, sorry.
Do you want us to cut, or...

687
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,495
Are we, like, walking?
What are you...

688
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,041
Oh, cut. Yeah, cut!
That's a cut!

689
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,917
Cutting.

690
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,132
- You okay?
- Yeah.

691
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,135
- That was so awkward.
- Yeah.

692
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,404
You guys can stop hugging now.

693
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,973
- Uh... Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

694
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,142
Hey, yeah,
you guys are killing it.

695
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,852
Um, it's just a...

696
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,913
You know,
it's just the lighting issue
we're trying to work out.

697
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,398
But you keep doing
what you're doing.

698
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,734
- That's good, right?
- Yeah, really good.

699
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:36,363
Jess, Jess, Jess.
Uh, so I just have
a quick question.

700
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,532
When I hang the ornament
on the tree,

701
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,076
do you want me to cry a little?

702
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,538
Do you want to cry a little?

703
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,040
I can cry a little.

704
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,292
I can do it whenever I want,
I can cry on command.

705
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:53,922
-Well, let's try it.
It could be nice.
-Okay.

706
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,967
Okay.

707
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,972
- Okay, everyone, let's reset.
- Yeah

708
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,266
- Let's try it again.
- What is she doing?

709
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,314
- You okay?
- Yeah.

710
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,985
All right, back to one,
everyone.

711
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,364
Roll sound.

712
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,491
Roll camera.

713
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,116
Rolling.

714
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,838
Are you going to lunch
or do you want me
to grab you something?

715
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,716
Still no word from Christopher.

716
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,926
Sorry.

717
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,931
Hey, Jessica.
There's someone here to see you.

718
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,058
She's over on the office set.

719
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,434
The office set?

720
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,224
I'll just take this out
of your way. It's gotta
be dry by now.

721
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,812
- Jessica, hi.
- Yes.

722
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,566
- I'm Theresa Frost.
- I'm the New Network president.

723
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,152
- Great to finally meet you.
- You too.

724
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,071
We're really getting
a lot of attention
from you guys lately.

725
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:45,951
Yes, we've been in such
a twister with this whole
Christmas movie thing.

726
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,663
Well... This thing?

727
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,374
We're going to dial back
your budget to completion.

728
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,126
In the middle of production?

729
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,004
Oh, you have no idea
the over-spending
that we inherited.

730
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,173
We're tightening the belt
across the board.

731
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,049
Wow. Okay.

732
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:07,181
- Does Christopher know
about this?
- Um, it was his idea.

733
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,891
So, clearly.

734
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,870
I'm sure he told you
that we're shutting down

735
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,254
the whole
Christmas Movie division.

736
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,021
Oh...

737
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,192
He did. Yeah.

738
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,236
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,198
There's just...

740
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,825
so much better content
available out there.

741
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,078
Right? I mean, no offense.
You know what I mean.

742
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,832
Anyway, I will leave you to it.
It was so nice
to meet you though.

743
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,751
- So vibrant.
- Thanks.

744
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,394
Christopher knew about this?

745
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,064
Something's not right.

746
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,857
Theresa shouldn't
be cutting your budget.

747
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,222
She should be the girlfriend
that's wrong for Christopher.

748
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,072
I'm texting Christopher.

749
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,675
This is because you changed
the script! It's spilling over
into your story line.

750
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,243
I don't have a story line,
Reena!

751
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,079
This is my life,
and it's falling apart!

752
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,006
I got it.

753
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,148
You better have a real good
explanation for this.

754
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:57,915
What did he say?

755
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,880
I'm not dealing
with this right now.

756
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,844
Ugh. Is this how he's climbed
the corporate ladder?

757
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,868
He has a girlfriend.
Did you know
he had a girlfriend?

758
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:19,146
- No, I just found out
she is his wife.
- No! He said girlfriend.

759
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,441
- Christopher told you
he has a girlfriend?
- Who is Christopher?

760
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:26,695
- Who are you talking about?
- Stupid sexy Michael!

761
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,530
- Michael has a girlfriend?
- Yes!

762
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,491
And that's made you
this mad because...

763
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,160
You slept together?

764
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,787
Yeah. You told me
to make her feel
like I see her.

765
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,165
- By complimenting her.
- I did.

766
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,708
Well, it worked too well!

767
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,127
I feel like it kind of worked
just the right amount.

768
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,837
She said you have a girlfriend.

769
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,839
Yeah, I do,
but she's an actor, too.

770
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:49,259
And, she and I have this deal
that sho-mances don't count
as cheating.

771
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,222
So, your girlfriend
is fine with it?

772
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,724
Yeah, it was her idea!

773
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,475
Okay.

774
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,103
Well...

775
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,987
Did you ever think that Ashley
might not be fine with
being a sho-mance?

776
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,361
I mean, we didn't discuss it.

777
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,115
Well, you might have a girl
who's falling for you here.

778
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,702
Hmm.

779
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,081
Oh, boy.

780
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,998
Michael,

781
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,377
listen to me, uh...

782
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,049
You can't play games
with people's hearts.

783
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:33,428
And you can't predict when
and where someone might find
a true love story.

784
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,555
Even on a movie set, it happens.

785
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,977
Okay, I'll talk to her.

786
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,522
Thank you.

787
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,824
Daniel.

788
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,913
Sorry...
It just helps me relax.

789
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,432
Have you seen
the new budget numbers?

790
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,916
I've heard some things.

791
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,040
Mmm-hmm. What? We're gonna have
to make some cuts...

792
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,188
No. I'm not
compromising one frame.
I need to talk to Christopher.

793
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,148
- Okay, but we
should start thinking...
- I will handle this.

794
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,842
- We should start thinking
about it now.
- I will handle this!

795
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,433
What the...

796
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,061
Did Zooey come by here?

797
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,105
- That way.
- Oh!

798
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,732
Do you need some help?

799
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,066
No, I got her!

800
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,112
- Jess.
- Yeah.

801
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,780
Christopher has
been looking for you.

802
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,992
- And...?
- And he's here. In our trailer.

803
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,265
What just happened to me?

804
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:01,933
I'm so sorry.

805
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,643
Was this the plan all along?

806
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,167
Just pretend you care and then
pull the rug out from under us?

807
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,647
I do care.

808
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,491
Is that why you suggested
cutting our budget?

809
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,068
- Is that what Theresa said?
- Yes.

810
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,864
Did she also say that they
were gonna stop production
all together?

811
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,867
Jessica, today I was told
to shut you down.

812
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,328
Shut us down?

813
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,417
It's my fault.

814
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:32,214
I didn't understand
some of the finishing cost
in the budget,

815
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,008
I didn't realize we needed
that much money

816
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,343
for the completion of the film.

817
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,904
You're supposed to
be the numbers guy.

818
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,513
I know, I know.

819
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,516
And I'm so sorry.

820
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,061
But when Theresa saw
the correct amount,
she freaked.

821
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,272
I had to convince her
we could still finish but...

822
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,150
with what we have left.

823
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,486
It can't get finished
for less, Christopher!

824
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,029
Our budget was perfect!

825
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,644
Well, now you have a new budget.

826
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,869
So... Okay. So what?

827
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,663
It's either this or nothing?

828
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,425
Okay, everybody,
we're back from lunch.

829
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,043
I'm gonna finish my damn movie.

830
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,562
Excuse me.

831
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,663
Hey...

832
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:55,255
Daniel, did we change
the cupcakes to keto cupcakes?

833
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,299
Loading them up now.

834
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,552
It's not too late
to change them back
to cupcakes made with love.

835
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,597
Just get everyone ready
to shoot.

836
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,850
Pictures up.
Whitney, keto cupcakes?

837
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:07,933
Seconds away.

838
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,443
Keto cupcakes.

839
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,737
I like it.

840
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,323
- Was that the surprise
you texted me about?
- Get out.

841
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,286
-What?
-Go on.
This is now a closed set.

842
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,206
Reena?

843
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,501
Yes?

844
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,866
Can you please escort
our network executive
off of the set?

845
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,547
Me?

846
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,798
We are on a very tight budget

847
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,759
and I can't afford
any distractions.

848
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,556
Fine.

849
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,141
I'll go.

850
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,393
I'm just relieved that
this is still happening.

851
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,646
Clock's ticking.

852
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,191
Good luck.

853
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,193
We say "break a leg"
in this business.

854
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,158
Daniel,

855
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,576
is the dog here yet?

856
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,660
Flying in.

857
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,080
Big gesture.

858
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,582
What's that?

859
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,417
That's how you get
her past this.

860
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,753
- I do?
- Yes.

861
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,506
Big city hotshot screws up,
but then makes a big gesture

862
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,924
because he has
come to appreciate

863
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,592
what the small town girl
believes in.

864
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,179
I tried. What else
am I supposed to do?

865
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,514
You'll figure it out.

866
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,890
We're here!

867
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,558
We're here! Zooey's here!

868
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,102
I got her! She's fine!

869
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,814
She's absolutely fine!
She is fine! Zooey flying in.

870
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,607
Excuse me.

871
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,702
I think that's everyone.

872
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,495
Do you want
to roll sound on this?

873
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,956
Not on this.
It's for the montage.

874
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,542
Okay, sound stand down.

875
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,752
Everyone else, let's do this.

876
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,130
Quiet on set.

877
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,549
Roll camera.

878
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,676
- Rolling.
- Stop the MOS.

879
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,308
And...

880
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,477
action.

881
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,643
Okay, cut!

882
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,829
All of this and rain?

883
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,039
We made it to the last day.

884
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,376
What time tomorrow?

885
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:44,794
1:00 p.m. crew call.

886
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,840
How many townspeople do we have?

887
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,050
None.

888
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,095
What?

889
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,823
I told you we're gonna have
to make cuts along the way,

890
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,015
and you didn't want to,

891
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,474
so now we have
no money for extras.

892
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,062
A town-wide celebration
with no townspeople?

893
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,107
We have a Santa.

894
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,777
- How many kids
to meet Santa?
- Oh, God, no.

895
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,947
- You know how much onset
teachers cost.
- How about a band?

896
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,908
- No.
- A singer?

897
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,117
No, nothing.

898
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:22,999
Christmas Celebration has
to be big and magical.

899
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,877
It's where the lovers kiss
for the first time!

900
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,928
It's Christopher.

901
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:39,724
He says he has an idea
for the Christmas Celebration.

902
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,935
- Oh, that's a good timing.
- Call him.

903
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,396
- No, we don't need him.
- It wouldn't hurt
to talk to him.

904
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,608
- He's still around.
- What? Where?

905
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,838
Oh, boy.

906
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,968
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

907
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,804
You never said
I couldn't be involved,
just not on the set, so...

908
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,597
Brett's been letting me
watch the dailies.

909
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,853
About the
Christmas Celebration,
I have some really...

910
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,523
Don't you think you've
caused enough problems?

911
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,358
Hear me out.

912
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,419
Uh, my nephew
is in a summer theatre program
at his high school.

913
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,820
It is 15 kids.

914
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,839
They could be in the movie
for work-study credits.

915
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,740
We don't even have to pay them.

916
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,659
Fifteen high school kids?

917
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,887
That's not a town-wide
celebration, that's a tenth
of a senior prom.

918
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,997
We can throw big hats and coats
on them.

919
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,599
We need bodies,
that's what matters most.

920
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,167
We already had
the perfect background actors.

921
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,419
Well, now we don't.

922
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,170
I also go
to First Presbyterian Church,

923
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,757
and they have a 25-member choir
plus musical accompaniment.

924
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,069
I made a deal with the pastor
that they could be in the movie

925
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,720
as part of a community
outreach event,

926
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,555
so, we don't have
to pay them either.

927
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,223
Amateur musicians, great.

928
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,809
- What is going on with you?
- We're just plugging holes.

929
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,687
What other options
do we have right now?

930
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,023
Christopher,
these are great ideas.

931
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,191
Do you have time to draw up
the paperwork with me?

932
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,450
Only if it's okay with Jessica.

933
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,208
Everything doesn't
have to be perfect.

934
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,301
Fine.

935
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:43,556
Okay, good.

936
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:45,725
Let's just spend
the final day herding cats.

937
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,643
Make it happen.

938
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:01,050
Well, that was it.

939
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,302
This is our last day.

940
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,055
The bakery is officially closed.

941
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,602
The Christmas Celebration?

942
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,729
I'm not really in the mood
for celebrating.

943
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,150
I don't care that Jeb's going
to be there.

944
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,068
I never want
to see his face ever again.

945
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,288
Christmas is ruined.

946
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,584
Okay, cut!

947
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,336
- That was good.
- That was great.

948
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,256
- Good shot.
- Good?

949
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,008
We got it. Moving on.

950
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,886
All right,
that's lunch everyone.

951
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,973
Next scene is
at the Town Square
for the Christmas Celebration.

952
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,228
I don't ever wanna see
your face again.

953
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,564
- Look, I just wanna show
you something.
- What?

954
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,816
- Look.
- Oh, God.

955
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,110
-What filter is that?
Clarendon?
-Yeah.

956
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,280
- Could you be any more basic?
- Hey, look at the likes.

957
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,909
Notice anything different?

958
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,874
I have 400,000 new followers.
I have 400,000 new followers.

959
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,251
She's got 400,000 new followers.

960
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,212
- Okay, uh...
- We broke the Internet.

961
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,049
Let's go take photos wearing
each other's wardrobe.

962
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,425
- It's brilliant.
- Let's go.

963
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,469
I'm obsessed.

964
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,763
Well, thank you
for letting us know.

965
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,896
We have a problem.

966
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,236
The paperwork didn't go through
for the church

967
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,613
to be able to participate as
community outreach.

968
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,906
So, now we have...

969
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,283
no choir
or musical accompaniment.

970
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:51,743
Oh, no.

971
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,668
Um...

972
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:03,297
Maybe the theatre kids
will be enough.

973
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,759
15 teenagers
representing an entire town?

974
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:08,678
Well, we can, we can...

975
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:12,557
We can reuse them.
We can stack 'em, shoot 'em,
move 'em around.

976
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,436
So now we have to lose
the musical part of the scene.

977
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,649
I think so.

978
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,109
This ruins everything.

979
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,071
Daniel, I needed this.

980
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,615
How can I get the network
to reconsider Christmas movies

981
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,117
if this one looks like a joke?

982
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,578
I'm sorry.

983
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,582
No, it's not your fault.

984
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,084
It's... mine.

985
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,222
I ruined Christmas.

986
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,278
We can fix this.

987
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,112
How?

988
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,158
We need to follow the formula.

989
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,494
- What formula?
- Is Christopher here today?

990
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,538
- He's in editing.
- Get him.

991
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,127
I'm sorry
about the church extras.

992
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,564
Forget that. This isn't about
the Christmas movie right now.

993
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,672
It's about Jessica.

994
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:29,383
- Me?
- Yes.

995
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,177
You need to confront
your character flaw.

996
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,012
That's what
needs to happen right now.

997
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,098
- Wait. Like, in
a Christmas movie?
- Yes.

998
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,186
Do you have a better idea?

999
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:44,940
Then let's get to it.

1000
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,529
That's what I've
been saying this whole time.

1001
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,949
You know what you need to say.

1002
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,951
So just say it.

1003
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,085
Okay.

1004
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:09,006
- So, you want me to say my
perfectionism gets in my way?
- Yep.

1005
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,676
- That's it.
- I'm afraid so, yeah.

1006
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,722
Okay, then.

1007
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,185
So, let's unpack that.

1008
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,812
Where do you think
that comes from?

1009
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,147
I don't know.

1010
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,692
Jessica, think.

1011
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,277
Haven't you ever been
to therapy?

1012
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,279
It's always a tether
to your childhood.

1013
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,532
What was it for you?

1014
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,326
Well...

1015
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,915
I guess my parents fought a lot.

1016
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:44,250
- I'm so sorry.
- Shh.

1017
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,550
And I always just tried so hard
to be perfect, you know.

1018
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:55,553
Like,

1019
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,917
just so I wouldn't give them
another thing to fight about.

1020
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:05,354
But every year when we went
to visit my Grandma Pearl
at Christmas time,

1021
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:10,151
everyone would be
on their best behavior.

1022
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,989
Cuddling up with Grandma Pearl

1023
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,618
and watching people fall
in love at Christmas time.

1024
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,621
That was, um...

1025
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,833
That was my safe space.

1026
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,464
That's the feeling that I
always wanted to create

1027
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,467
with my movies, you know.

1028
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,635
To give everyone else
that feeling.

1029
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,723
And...

1030
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:43,267
if I can't get it perfect,
I just...

1031
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,229
feel like I'm just letting
everyone down.

1032
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,108
So...

1033
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:52,776
There it is.

1034
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,115
You can't make a perfect movie,
Jessica.

1035
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,762
I bet all those movies
the two of you watched together

1036
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,953
weren't perfect either.

1037
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,041
No, not by a long shot.

1038
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:10,252
Um... Neither was my movie,
Perfectly Christmas.

1039
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,816
And people loved it anyway,
because...

1040
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,172
Because it had heart.

1041
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:18,636
It's not an equation.

1042
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,263
It's an art form.

1043
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,475
It's an art form where all
these people get to come
together and contribute

1044
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,394
to make this one special thing.

1045
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:31,357
And that is what's
on the screen. It's the love.

1046
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,155
You guys are right.

1047
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,658
Everything does not have
to be perfect.

1048
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,789
Okay, boom. There it is.

1049
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,624
We have addressed
your character flaw.

1050
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,587
Now the final resolution
to the main conflict
can present itself.

1051
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:03,806
Can present itself.

1052
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,164
Santa!

1053
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,835
Ho, ho, ho!

1054
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:38,132
Where are all the children?

1055
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:41,343
I heard there was a Christmas
Celebration happening here.

1056
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,600
Yes, I am sorry.

1057
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,476
I can get you signed in, Santa.

1058
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,480
Santa doesn't sign in.
Santa comes down the chimney!

1059
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,274
Okay.

1060
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,109
Were you able
to find parking all right?

1061
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:59,987
Oh, no trouble at all. I've got
the reindeer up on the roof.

1062
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,822
Of course.

1063
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,616
Just what we need,
a method Santa.

1064
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,117
Where are my elves?

1065
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,912
- I can lead you
to your trailer.
- Okay.

1066
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,123
Music! There must be music!

1067
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:13,792
I can play you music
on my guitar, Santa.

1068
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,294
Oh!

1069
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,880
- Daniel, wait!
- Yeah?

1070
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,468
Can you play Christmas songs
on your guitar?

1071
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,511
I can play the chords
to just about anything.

1072
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,763
It won't be perfect, though.

1073
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,222
Doesn't matter.

1074
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,186
Does anyone else on the crew
play an instrument?

1075
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,979
The editor does.

1076
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,481
How do you know that?

1077
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,900
I spent a lot of time
with him in there.

1078
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:39,985
He's a little weird.

1079
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,488
Well, maybe we can put together
a band after all.

1080
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,491
Let's ask everyone on the crew
if they play an instrument.

1081
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,302
If they do, they're in
the band, if they don't,

1082
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,454
then we'll use them as
townsfolk for the celebration.

1083
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,664
We'll still need a singer.

1084
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,167
You got it.

1085
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,752
Just follow me this way, sir.

1086
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,048
All hands-on deck,

1087
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,342
and maybe with the help of
a little Christmas magic...

1088
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,636
Love can save Christmas!

1089
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:13,519
Hey, fellas, bring it in.
Bring it in.
Over here. Let's go.

1090
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,396
Quick little team meeting.

1091
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,111
Guys, I need your help.

1092
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,239
Hey, Brett.

1093
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,865
Any chance you got your violin?

1094
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,124
Who wants to be on camera
for once?

1095
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:38,544
I have an idea for you.

1096
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,088
Who wants to be in a movie?

1097
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,059
Look at that.

1098
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,087
Oh, that's good...

1099
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,923
- Chloe.
- What do you want?

1100
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,592
I have something to show you.

1101
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,303
Your bakery doesn't
have to close.

1102
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,804
You two seem good.

1103
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,728
- Yeah, we're great.
- Yeah, we're really good.

1104
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,100
- We're so good.
- So, his girlfriend actually
met someone

1105
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,936
on the movie that she's doing
and dumped him.

1106
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,147
- So, it's like perfect timing.
- Perfect timing.

1107
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,356
I love you.

1108
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,318
- You're so hot.
- You're so... hot.

1109
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,570
Shut your beautiful lips. Stop.

1110
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,572
Okay,
Christmas miracles everywhere.

1111
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,120
Daniel.

1112
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,081
Did you call our Santa to set?

1113
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:00,334
I did, 20 minutes ago.

1114
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:01,877
He's not in his trailer.

1115
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,754
But Christopher's out looking
for him now.

1116
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:08,008
Okay... Well...

1117
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,134
Hey, Daniel!

1118
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,471
Coming!

1119
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,848
The dog pooped on set.

1120
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,850
Did the dog poop on set?

1121
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,894
Bob, don't... Bob!

1122
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,860
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, we do.

1123
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,534
Theresa! Hi!

1124
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:35,285
Uh, what brings you to set?

1125
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,163
Christopher insisted
that I come see this...

1126
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,041
- Christmas Celebration shoot.
- Oh.

1127
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,627
He did? That's, that's...

1128
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,548
That's great.

1129
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:48,966
Okay, but when is it
gonna start?

1130
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:51,176
'Cause I haven't got all night.

1131
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,429
We're just about ready to shoot.

1132
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,680
Shouldn't be too long.

1133
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,223
What...

1134
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:58,684
What in the world is
that supposed to be?

1135
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,731
We couldn't afford to have
any actual children
in the scene...

1136
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,442
for tonight.

1137
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,864
- It looks ridiculous.
- We'll make it work.

1138
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,365
Will you?

1139
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:16,493
It's gonna look great,
once the lights come on and...

1140
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,038
- our lenses.
- And Santa?

1141
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,249
What about Santa?

1142
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:27,087
He is on his way.

1143
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,881
Little reindeer here
about this big?

1144
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:34,511
Yeah, like this big,
and I also wanted you
to name it Lima.

1145
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:38,390
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

1146
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:40,976
These wonderful children
just needed a little
Christmas magic.

1147
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,854
They're ready to shoot.
I have to get you to set.

1148
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:47,482
No, no, no, I need a few
more minutes with these
delightful youngsters.

1149
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,776
Hi. We don't have
a few more minutes!

1150
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,863
Every 15 minutes that ticks by
is another shot lost
from the movie.

1151
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,408
Santa, you're coming with me.

1152
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:19,181
We're just waiting for the sun
to go down a little bit more...

1153
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,098
Yeah.

1154
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,683
- For the shot.
- Mmm.

1155
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,602
-It just needs to be...
just right.
-Right.

1156
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:28,232
I wonder maybe if this is why
our movies go over budget.

1157
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,987
On Dasher!

1158
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,284
I just read this article.

1159
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:43,914
This woman whose husband
locked her in the basement
for six months.

1160
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,293
That... would make
a great movie.

1161
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,046
Hello!

1162
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,758
Careful now.

1163
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,055
Hey!

1164
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:09,147
Well, I think I've seen enough.

1165
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,066
Have Christopher give me a call.

1166
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,610
He and I have a lot to discuss.

1167
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,694
Mmm-hmm.

1168
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,200
All right, we're here!

1169
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,494
- I've got Santa!
- Ho, ho, ho.

1170
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,664
- Theresa, hi.
- Ho, ho, ho.

1171
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,000
Now this is a celebration!

1172
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,836
Oh, hello. Have you been
a naughty girl this year?

1173
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,337
- Daniel!
- Yes.

1174
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,006
-No, no, no.
Santa, how are you?
-Hey.

1175
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,841
- It's nice to have you back
on set.
- Okay.

1176
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,926
Let me escort you
to your throne.

1177
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,970
Um, I am leaving.

1178
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,388
No, no, you can't go.

1179
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,949
You gotta stay for
the Christmas Celebration.

1180
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,559
I think I've seen
what I need to see.

1181
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:49,062
Come on, everybody
on this movie has worked
so hard to make this special.

1182
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:54,192
Special? There's crew members
in the movie. There's sandbags
dressed up as children.

1183
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,087
At least I know now that I made
the right decision

1184
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,529
shutting all of this down.

1185
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:04,411
What a Grinch.

1186
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,413
Grinch.

1187
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,583
Her heart
is two sizes too small.

1188
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,461
Ms. Frost... Wait!

1189
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,383
- You can't go.
- Why not?

1190
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,887
By any chance,
is there something

1191
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,057
that happened to you
to make you hate Christmas?

1192
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,476
What? Don't be ridiculous.

1193
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:32,773
Nothing from when you
were a little girl?

1194
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,400
Did you enjoy Christmas
when you were young?

1195
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,277
Yeah, I enjoyed it enough.

1196
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,406
But...

1197
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,075
there is something.

1198
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,412
Ugh...

1199
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:54,503
Well, I was finally
going to be the lead
in our Christmas pageant.

1200
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,586
Yeah?

1201
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,715
And then, the choir director's
daughter

1202
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,093
transferred into our school
and she got to do it.

1203
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,346
And you...

1204
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,449
Oh, there weren't
any other parts left
for me to play,

1205
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,935
so, I sat in the audience
and watched her sing
the final song, and,

1206
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,061
get all the attention.

1207
01:18:14,689 --> 01:18:15,689
Theresa.

1208
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,488
You were meant to be our singer.

1209
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:24,574
- For what?
- For our Christmas Celebration.

1210
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,619
- Oh...
- You were born
to play this part.

1211
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:31,206
Oh, no.
No, I'm not a performer.

1212
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:34,793
You were and it was taken away
from you.

1213
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,254
But I can give it back to you.

1214
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:44,928
Me? Singing in
a Christmas musical?

1215
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:50,100
I got you. I believe in you.

1216
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:52,144
- Just take some breaths.
- Oh...

1217
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:58,191
And tonight,
you get to share your gifts
with the entire world, at last.

1218
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,568
I would really like that.

1219
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,153
I mean...

1220
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,990
- I guess.
- Let's do this.

1221
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,741
Okay.

1222
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,707
Okay.

1223
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:17,461
Call it, Daniel.

1224
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:20,547
All right, party people.
It's celebration time.

1225
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,215
Roll sound.

1226
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,843
Roll camera.

1227
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:27,304
Scene 68. Take one. Mark.

1228
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:33,768
And... action.

1229
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:39,774
Mmm.

1230
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,447
- Chloe. Hey, Chloe.
- What do you want?

1231
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,240
- I have to show you something.
- What?

1232
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:49,451
Your bakery
doesn't have to close!

1233
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,369
Why not?

1234
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,997
Our parent company
also owns Landmark Foods.

1235
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,542
I brought your cupcakes to them
and they were a huge hit.

1236
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,920
- The keto cupcakes?
- No, no.

1237
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:02,839
You were right all along.
It was your original cupcakes.

1238
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,259
Well, yeah, that makes sense.
They're made with love,

1239
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,178
and nothing is better than that.

1240
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,389
Look. This is a contract

1241
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,059
for Chloe's Cupcakes
to be sold worldwide.

1242
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,730
"Chloe's Cupcakes
will all be made and shipped

1243
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:22,275
from the original
Chloe's Cakes kitchen
that your mother founded."

1244
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,570
- Right here?
- Right here.

1245
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:29,908
I don't want you to have to
leave this beautiful town, and,

1246
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,285
I mean, frankly,
I don't wanna leave either.

1247
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,332
Will you let me stay
and help you?

1248
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,836
Wait. What about Nadia?

1249
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,755
I broke it off with her.

1250
01:20:43,838 --> 01:20:45,924
I should have done it
a long time ago.

1251
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:54,766
Okay, so, you want to stay here
and help me sell cupcakes?

1252
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:57,477
Nothing would make me happier.

1253
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:04,109
Yeah, I think you're right.

1254
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:08,488
Oh, we are going to need
a bigger kitchen.

1255
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:15,787
Welcome, everyone
to the Christmas Celebration.

1256
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:19,916
This song goes out
to all the Christmas lovers
out there.

1257
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,918
The ones who love Christmas,

1258
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,797
- and the ones who find love
at Christmas.
- Aw!

1259
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:41,479
Oh the weather
Outside is frightful

1260
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:45,650
But the fire Is so delightful

1261
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:49,446
And since we've No place to go

1262
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:56,244
Let It Snow!
Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

1263
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:02,000
It doesn't show
Signs of stopping

1264
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:06,379
And I've bought
Some corn for popping

1265
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:10,050
The lights are turned
Way down low

1266
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:14,095
Let It Snow!
Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

1267
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:18,308
When we finally Kiss goodnight

1268
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:22,479
How I'll hate
Going out in the storm!

1269
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:26,942
But if you'll really
Hold me tight

1270
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:31,279
All the way home I'll be warm

1271
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,824
The fire is slowly dying

1272
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:39,079
And, my dear,
We're still goodbying

1273
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:43,541
But as long as You love me so...

1274
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,878
Oh, Jeb. This is
the best Christmas ever.

1275
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,715
- Cut!
- That's a cut.

1276
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:53,134
Where's the snow?

1277
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:59,933
We can't have the kiss
without the snow.

1278
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:02,268
I'm sorry, Jessica.
I don't know what's wrong.

1279
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,770
Give me a minute.

1280
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,897
Sorry, guys. That was great.

1281
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,067
Just chill for a second
while we get this situated.

1282
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,068
- Okay.
- Uh...

1283
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,403
Let's go rehearse the kiss.

1284
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,487
Ooh.

1285
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:18,118
I thought that was going
pretty well until the snow.

1286
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:20,036
We'll get it. I'm not worried.

1287
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,953
I wanted to tell you that I
tried to convince Theresa

1288
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,254
that we needed your Christmas
movies for our international
streaming launch.

1289
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,256
I thought that going worldwide,
like,

1290
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,133
Chloe's Cakes,
would save the day.

1291
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:35,384
And did it?

1292
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,513
It did not.

1293
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:40,181
Because that's not how it works.

1294
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,434
What? Why not?

1295
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:45,061
You saw the scene.
Logic doesn't save Christmas.

1296
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,938
Love saves Christmas.

1297
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,482
It always does.

1298
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,943
Well, love can save cupcakes,

1299
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,237
but maybe it can't save
a movie deal.

1300
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,659
Oh, my! That was
so exhilarating!

1301
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,536
- I loved it!
- You were amazing!

1302
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:03,037
- I was okay?
- Amazing.

1303
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:06,166
I was amazing? Oh, gosh,
I just...

1304
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:07,489
I forgot the feeling, you know,

1305
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,753
that you get from
Christmas movies.

1306
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:12,464
And that our network needs this.

1307
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,299
It... does?

1308
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:18,094
Nobody wants to watch
women-in-peril at Christmas,
right?

1309
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,973
We need these kinds of movies
to hold onto our audience.

1310
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:23,600
I feel like I said
something like that.

1311
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,393
I completely agree with you.

1312
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,312
I am going to honor
your contract

1313
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,064
for three more Christmas movies.

1314
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:34,360
I am officially reopening
the Christmas Movie division!

1315
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,030
As long as I can be in them.

1316
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:39,407
Just kidding. I mean, I might.
Guess we'll find out.

1317
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,910
Wow.

1318
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:45,914
Love saved Christmas.

1319
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,291
Of course, it did.

1320
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,505
Jessica,

1321
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,024
do you remember
when you were talking

1322
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,549
about planting your flag?

1323
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,302
Yeah.

1324
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:01,846
This is where I want
to plant my flag.

1325
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,766
Right next to yours,
if you'll let me.

1326
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:11,272
What about your career
in finance?

1327
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,483
I am done with that.

1328
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:16,152
I want to be the guy
who helps create this...

1329
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,321
this warm, comforting,
safe place

1330
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,490
that the world gets
to live in at Christmas time.

1331
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:24,869
Do you need a producer, maybe?

1332
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,960
I don't know. I mean...
uh, a producer...

1333
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,963
You probably gonna have to be
on set with me every day.

1334
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:38,716
Nothing would make me happier.

1335
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,141
Wait. Stop.
What about your wife?

1336
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:49,602
My what?

1337
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:52,897
Your wife. Theresa.

1338
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,023
- Theresa?
- Yes.

1339
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,125
Why are you calling her my wife?

1340
01:25:55,149 --> 01:25:56,067
Because you did.

1341
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,194
- When?
- In your text.

1342
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:01,948
Oh, stupid voice-to-text.

1343
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:03,908
It's keeps dropping words,
not my...

1344
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,787
Not my real wife.
My work wife.

1345
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,332
There it is. Classic romantic
misunderstanding.

1346
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,253
How did I not figure that out?
Right, guys?

1347
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,671
Miscommunication.

1348
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:18,590
That goes way back to,
like, Shakespeare, and,

1349
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,383
He's Just Not That Into You.

1350
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:21,968
- Reena?
- Yes.

1351
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,722
Can you give us a moment?

1352
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:27,140
In the trailer?

1353
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:29,183
No, just like, a step
or two off to the side.

1354
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:35,857
I mean, okay...

1355
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:37,691
So...

1356
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:39,943
what do you think?

1357
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:44,489
I think...

1358
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,161
This is the best Christmas ever.

1359
01:26:58,713 --> 01:26:59,713
I knew it.

1360
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,428
Well, look at that.

1361
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,146
Okay, save some snow
for the movie.

1362
01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:17,315
That's not me.

1363
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,157
Huh.

1364
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:29,409
Snow in LA.

1365
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:33,873
I guess you just can't
contain Christmas magic.
