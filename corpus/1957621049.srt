1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:03,733
- Hi, I'm Ted V. Mikels, a film maker.

2
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:07,680
World peace has not been
achieved in the century,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,961
and may never be achieved.

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:13,415
The film you are about to
see is about man's inhumanity

5
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:14,615
to man.

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,532
(percussive music)

7
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,419
(ominous music)

8
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,646
(percussive music)

9
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:55,977
(structures explode)

10
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,364
(screams)

11
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:48,767
- [Radio Announcer] On the second front,

12
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,442
the Liberation Army is
meeting heavy resistance

13
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:54,175
by the better equipped
and better trained Army

14
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,971
of the Republic.

15
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:57,965
Casualties are heavy on both sides,

16
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,501
but the fighters of the
New Order remain determined

17
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,417
to push through to the country's border.

18
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,911
Food supplies remain scarce,
and fighters are weary,

19
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:09,166
and are often without water, making gains

20
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,244
even more difficult.

21
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,163
This radio frequency will
continue to report news

22
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:17,297
of the warfare hourly,
with momentary updates

23
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:18,975
on major changes.

24
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,392
Keep tuned to this frequency.

25
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:47,028
(distant explosion)

26
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,548
(distant gun fires)

27
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,925
(bomb whistles)

28
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,925
(distant explosion)

29
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,750
- Well, I don't care what
in the hell they're doin'.

30
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,736
I own this plantation, and
I sweat blood to keep it!

31
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:11,910
And I ain't leavin'.

32
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,885
- You better take what you can now.

33
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,030
I see the handwriting on the wall.

34
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,339
- Oh, you're nuts woman.

35
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,305
You're always seeing
things that ain't there.

36
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,435
You takin' what you want?

37
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:23,087
- I'm takin' what I need to get by.

38
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:25,112
I'm only allowed one bag on the airplane,

39
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,923
and it's the last one out of here.

40
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,167
- Yeah?

41
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,305
What about all them fancy
dresses and expensive shoes

42
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:33,218
and jewelry you bought?

43
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:35,096
- I have enough cash and jewelry.

44
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:38,424
Just let the maidservants
and the slaves have the rest,

45
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,488
and if you have any sense,
you'd get out now, too,

46
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:41,921
while you can.

47
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,739
- Eh, I don't need you
tellin' me what to do woman.

48
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,050
I'll get out when I'm damn good and ready.

49
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,654
- Good luck, you're gonna
need it when they take over.

50
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:51,303
- Yeah?

51
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,273
What the hell can they do to me?

52
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:57,170
When I leave this place,
it'll be over my dead body.

53
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,760
- That's not gonna do you much good.

54
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,082
You're gonna be wishin' you
were on that plane with me.

55
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:02,915
- Eh!

56
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,684
Good riddance, woman.

57
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,299
(distant gun fires)

58
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,517
- Let's get outta here.

59
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,056
- What's the matter?

60
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:17,641
- My husband is not leaving.

61
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:18,589
- He's not leaving?

62
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,422
He's gotta go.

63
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,313
- It's his choice.

64
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,470
Now, let's go.

65
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,799
- But if he stays here,
they'll wind up killing him.

66
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,312
- Oh, that's his problem and his choice.

67
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,902
The plane leaves in less than an hour,

68
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:28,844
and I'm gonna be on it.

69
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,011
Now, let's go.

70
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:39,821
(bomb whistles)

71
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:43,121
(car revs)

72
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,784
- What the hell are you lookin' at?

73
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,701
Get busy, and you, too.

74
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:13,772
- Ah, good news.

75
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:15,949
The take over is nearly complete.

76
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,285
All the plantations, farms
and property-owned lands

77
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,079
have been confiscated by the new order.

78
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,778
- What we done with 'em?

79
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:25,484
- They'll be turned over to
the former slaves and servants.

80
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:28,638
Now, they'll be in total
control of everything.

81
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,816
Previously owned by the Landowners.

82
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,140
These are formal decrees
for claiming the legalities

83
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,669
of the transfer.

84
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,752
Deliver a set of these
every specified household.

85
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,018
- Who do they give 'em to?

86
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:47,185
- They'll be given to the head
servant in each household.

87
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,169
Carry on.

88
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,512
- What's goin' on here?

89
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,993
- You don't own me anymore.

90
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:09,340
- Yeah, I'll show you who owns who.

91
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,311
Did you whip her?

92
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,135
- Strung her up, whooped
her and branded her.

93
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,884
Didn't do no good.

94
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:17,382
- Yeah, I'll show you who owns who.

95
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,715
Turn her around.

96
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,701
(whip snaps)

97
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,201
(slave cries)

98
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,320
- Please, show her some
compassion, please?

99
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,214
- Compassion, hell?

100
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,958
You want some of the same?

101
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,212
(whip snaps)

102
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,712
(slave cries)

103
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,235
Turn her around.

104
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,288
She wants compassion.

105
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:02,251
I'll show you compassion.

106
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,348
I need new blood in my bed.

107
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:05,637
You want compassion?

108
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,803
You get up in my bedroom.

109
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,301
I'll show you compassion.

110
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,358
- I'd rather die first.

111
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:13,858
(slave spits)

112
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,227
- Listen.

113
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:21,996
She runs away again, you take that rifle,

114
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,421
and you track her down, and you kill

115
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,754
that little black bitch, you understand.

116
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,561
(officer knocks)

117
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,512
- Yes?

118
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,873
- I'm here for the New Order.

119
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:49,922
These papers make the head
maid, the servant Wateesah,

120
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:53,717
the new commandant in
control of this plantation.

121
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,188
- And what of the Landowner?

122
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,937
- He is no longer the Landowner.

123
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,040
If he has not fled, arrest him.

124
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,874
Form a court and try him.

125
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:02,955
Whatever sentence Wateesah
imposes will be upheld

126
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,007
by the New Order.

127
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,014
Do you understand?

128
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:06,847
- Yes.

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,412
- I can't take this no more.

130
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,814
- You may not have to.

131
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,025
Not for much longer.

132
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,238
- Why?

133
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,953
- Everything she left is ours.

134
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:26,433
Everything.

135
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,936
- Everything she owned?

136
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:32,125
- Everything, from her
shoes to her jewelry.

137
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,590
Her clothing.

138
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,392
Everything is ours.

139
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,225
- Hmm.

140
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:40,568
(intense music)

141
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:49,159
(servants chat)

142
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,188
- Money!
- Money!

143
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:56,605
- Money!
- Money!

144
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:01,987
- Money.

145
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,695
(servant laughs)

146
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,676
- You can help me find that money.

147
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,009
It's my money, this is mine.

148
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:27,336
- This is so beautiful.

149
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,086
- Gorgeous, gorgeous.

150
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:35,630
- Our stuff, now, our stuff.

151
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:48,850
- You be careful with
my gun, that's loaded.

152
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:54,089
(Landowner gasps)

153
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,208
- Do you know who I am?

154
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,041
- Yes.

155
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,902
You're Wateesah.

156
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:07,574
You're my main servant and
head maid of the household.

157
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:09,217
- No longer so.

158
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,717
I am Your Majesty.

159
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,012
You shall refer to me as Your Majesty,

160
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,179
is that clear?

161
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:19,628
- Yes.

162
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,033
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:26,182
- And hereafter, and during
the course of this trial,

164
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:30,064
you shall refer to me as Your Majesty.

165
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,709
Is that clear?

166
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,042
- Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:36,765
- Yes, what, you stupid pig?

168
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:39,893
- Yes, Your Majesty.

169
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:46,168
- Your escape from this country
was totally unacceptable

170
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,001
to us.

171
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,902
You taking your ill gained
wealth and possessions from

172
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:54,701
amongst us was more than we could bear.

173
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:57,898
Consequently, it became
necessary for us to take the law

174
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,481
into our own hands.

175
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,871
Since there is no law presently
functioning in this land,

176
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,443
this court has assembled
together to take you to trial

177
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:10,926
and try you for what you have done.

178
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,677
- [Landowner] What do you mean try me?

179
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:14,558
What do you mean try me?

180
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:16,657
You're all my servants, all of you.

181
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:18,914
You're all my servants, how dare you.

182
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,316
- [Wateesah] Silence.

183
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,726
Or has the blow to your head
from the heel of my shoe

184
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:25,643
dimmed the memory of your misdeeds?

185
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:27,831
- You're crazy.

186
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,948
You're all crazy.

187
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,659
I order you to release me.

188
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:32,742
You're crazy!

189
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,892
- Enough of this.

190
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:39,081
You are a prisoner of this court.

191
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:41,310
We have stripped you of all
of your earthly possessions,

192
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,246
and this court will bring you to trial.

193
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,829
- Ah, you're crazy!

194
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,378
I order you to release me.

195
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:53,109
- You are no longer our lord and master.

196
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:56,690
You are a prisoner of this court.

197
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,315
Ah, now, the table's are turned.

198
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:02,855
You're apartheid release will
be struck from your memory.

199
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:07,022
And we hereby make you aware
that I am to be your judge.

200
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:11,423
And these, my sisters, your jurors.

201
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:15,336
We will try you and determine
the extent of your guilt,

202
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:19,503
and judge you accordingly, in
this, our court of justice.

203
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,557
- I'm guilty of nothing.

204
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:23,846
Guilty of nothing.

205
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:25,263
- Enough of this.

206
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:31,217
Hereafter, you will speak
when you are asked to speak.

207
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:32,886
And you will address me in the manner

208
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:35,136
that you have been advised.

209
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,432
- Yes.

210
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:40,822
Yes.

211
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,912
- Yes, Your Majesty.

212
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:46,519
- Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,918
- Further, you will sink to
your knees when you address me.

214
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:51,751
Now!

215
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,714
That's better.

216
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:03,238
I have been ordained by this
court to do with you as I wish.

217
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,822
You have kept my people
in bondage and slavery

218
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:14,232
all the days of my life,
and many before me.

219
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:15,612
- I done nothing.

220
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,164
Why do you do this?

221
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:18,479
Who's taken care of you?

222
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:21,069
I've taken care of, and
you've been my maid servant

223
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,809
since you were a little child.

224
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,726
- You have done it all.

225
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:30,053
You forced me not only to be your maid,

226
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:31,553
but your mistress.

227
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,931
You forced my body to be
the unwilling receptical

228
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,431
for your maleness.

229
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,056
- But your country, I've done nothing.

230
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,245
I've done nothing.

231
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,589
I'm not guilty of anything.

232
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,937
- You stood by while all
the treachery was happening.

233
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,961
With this country's
soul, we invoked the yoke

234
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:53,576
of bondage and freed our
people from under the heel

235
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,065
of your tyranny.

236
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:58,100
You and your kind are all that was left.

237
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,659
(court murmurs)

238
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,409
- I stood behind you.

239
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,965
I tried to help.

240
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,450
I thought I took care of your sisters.

241
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,426
But, I stand behind that--

242
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,429
- No.

243
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:11,346
Do not lie.

244
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:17,699
In this court, we'll uncover the truth.

245
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:21,449
But you will be of
assistance, Mr. Landowner.

246
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:27,307
Mr. Would Be God, or
should I say anti-God.

247
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,796
Satan himself.

248
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,420
But you will help us agree here,

249
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,836
and we will make you an example.

250
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,503
(intense music)

251
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,792
- You're crazy.

252
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:43,903
All of you!

253
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:45,289
You're crazy!

254
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:46,544
I've done nothing!

255
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:47,377
You're crazy!

256
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,210
All of you!

257
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,722
- Silence!
- Shut up!

258
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:53,066
- Or now this weapon will
make a trial unnecessary.

259
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,048
(court murmurs)

260
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:58,071
What we will try you
for will be for others

261
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,404
who have unjustly enslaved and ruled us.

262
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,512
Your final act, resulting
in the deaths of 37

263
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,033
of our people, was when
you ordered your men

264
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,081
to round up the village families,

265
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,051
entrapping them in chain-linked fence

266
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,746
topped with barbed wire.

267
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:17,559
When the word spread
that you were taking them

268
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,223
to another place, to be
sold to a distant Landowner,

269
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:22,646
they panicked.

270
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:25,313
(woman screams)

271
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,970
The thought of being
removed from their families

272
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,085
and their homes was much more
than they could understand

273
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:33,918
or accept.

274
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:39,720
The strongest broke
through the chain fence.

275
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,263
And in their stampede to run for freedom,

276
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,954
you apprehended them.

277
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:44,787
All 37.

278
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,521
They were trampled to death.

279
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,708
Men and women.

280
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,541
But what we can never
forget are the children.

281
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:57,222
37 trampled, dead.

282
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:01,168
- [Landowner] That wasn't my fault.

283
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,469
- You caused their deaths.

284
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:07,527
We hold you totally responsible for this.

285
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:08,682
- Lies.

286
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:10,141
I'm not guilty.

287
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:11,507
Anything I've done.

288
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:13,238
Not at all, not at all.

289
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,280
I'm not guilty!

290
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,320
They're lies!

291
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,308
- We will judge you
for your transgressions

292
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:20,338
and misdeeds, not only against myself,

293
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:23,000
but against the other who have suffered

294
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,109
under the yoke of bondage
and inhumanities committed

295
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,787
upon us in your household.

296
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,438
You will be tried for
your personal injustices

297
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:33,605
and cruelties.

298
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:38,175
And if my lady jurors so
find you to be guilty,

299
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:40,941
executed in a manner that
they choose to be fitting.

300
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,093
- [Court Members] Yes, yes!

301
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:47,260
- But first, my jurors
shall introduce themselves.

302
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,760
- Butra.

303
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,690
- Suhya.

304
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,690
- Sellahlie.

305
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,500
- Fleurlilli.

306
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,333
- Etrosef.

307
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,317
- Wishtofti.

308
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:01,891
- Petrinah.

309
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:03,497
- Belahsa.

310
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,414
- Raybutta.

311
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:12,318
- And have you ladies of the
jury chosen a spokesperson?

312
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,151
- Yes!
- Yes, we have.

313
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:14,477
- Yes!

314
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:18,872
- Yes, we have chosen Butra
to be our spokeswoman.

315
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:20,122
- Butra, Butra.

316
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,938
- Yes, Your Majesty?

317
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:28,105
I would rather have been
selected as his executioner.

318
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:31,008
But then, who knows?

319
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,413
(Landowner grunts)

320
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:36,978
- Maybe I will be.

321
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:39,745
- Maybe we will all be his executioners,

322
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,702
should he be found guilty.

323
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,974
Have you decided the manner
in which he is to stand trial?

324
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:47,024
- [Butra] Yes, we have, Your Majesty.

325
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,638
- [Wateesa] And what manner will it be?

326
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:53,805
- We have decided that he
will lie down on the floor,

327
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,913
on his back!

328
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,467
With Your Majesty's feet
pressed into pit of his stomach.

329
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,667
(Landowner grunts)

330
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:05,047
As it was with you in your childhood.

331
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:08,400
As for for the rest of us,
we will place our chairs

332
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,317
around him!

333
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,166
And press his back to the floor.

334
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,430
Under our shoe, he and
what he represents to us,

335
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:23,556
deserves to be treated as dirt beneath us.

336
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:26,434
- [Jurors] Yeah!

337
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,184
- [Woman] And if he tongue is
loose, our kicks may find him.

338
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,767
(jurors chide)

339
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:44,598
- [Wateesah] So be it.

340
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:47,765
- [Landowner] You can't do this to me.

341
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:52,391
- [Butra] Now, on your back!

342
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,312
Now!

343
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,365
Or you're going down,

344
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:58,203
a-kicking.

345
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:02,495
(Landowner breathes heavily)

346
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,745
- Yes, strangely befitting.

347
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:09,897
The shoe is on the other foot, now.

348
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:12,543
When we as children,
according to your custom,

349
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:16,710
lay down on our backs, under
your cold and unfeeling feet.

350
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:23,544
Which were pressed in the pit
of our warm little bellies.

351
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,787
We were used to absorb
the pain and afflictions

352
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:32,678
from your body, the cold
deadly, transmitting your pain

353
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,511
to us.

354
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,775
The only pain I remember
was once as a child.

355
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:43,681
You were in a hurry to stand,
and you did not first remove

356
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,848
your feet from my stomach.

357
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:51,057
Your full weight upon my
tiny body forced the air

358
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:55,239
from my lungs, and my
mouth filled with the food

359
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,572
from my stomach.

360
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:01,648
Your body is much bigger
and stronger as mine was

361
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,565
as a child.

362
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:08,328
Perhaps, the sharp heels
of my shoes pressed

363
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:12,554
against your body will
make up the difference,

364
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:17,169
should I choose to stand
upon you as you did me,

365
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,002
you pig.

366
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:22,182
Let us proceed with the trial.

367
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,044
Let us first take an oath.

368
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:29,507
Do you as jurors swear
that the testimony you are

369
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:33,838
about to give, and the
charges you are about to make,

370
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:37,421
are true as seen or
witnessed by your eyes,

371
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,766
and not the hearsay of others?

372
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,003
- [Jurors] Yes.

373
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:43,241
- Yes.

374
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:46,074
Let's proceed with the trial then.

375
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,743
Butra.

376
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:52,714
You may start with the charges.

377
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:58,501
- First, let me say that this evil person

378
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,710
branded my man with the r for run away.

379
00:25:08,827 --> 00:25:10,577
Then, had him killed.

380
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:27,515
- Call upon the others for their charges.

381
00:25:27,515 --> 00:25:29,486
- Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,751
- You know, you know I'm
not guilty of these things.

383
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:35,602
I have done nothing, nothing like that.

384
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:36,525
They're lies!

385
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:39,025
(jurors yell)

386
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:40,776
- Stop!

387
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:45,792
Stop, sit down, save it for
until the trial is complete,

388
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:48,893
and sentence has been passed.

389
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:49,889
- [Landowner] Sentence for what?

390
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:52,639
What do you mean passed sentence?

391
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:58,280
- Butra, now do you have
witnesses for these charges?

392
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,006
- Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:04,842
I will now call upon
FLeurlilli for her testimony.

394
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,101
- No, no, please.

395
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:09,184
Keep her away from me, keep her away.

396
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:14,171
- My mother was enslaved by this very man.

397
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:17,026
At an early age.

398
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:20,687
And I was born in the fields.

399
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:24,520
Then, one day, this very
man brought my mother

400
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:31,144
into his household, and made
her into his personal slave.

401
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:34,977
Cooking and cleaning,
from sun up to sun down.

402
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:38,605
She had no life of her own.

403
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:42,438
I saw her lie down and
die, a tired old woman.

404
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:46,797
As long as she was alive
to keep me from you,

405
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:49,207
I was barely a slave.

406
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,874
But when mamma died, he used me.

407
00:26:53,117 --> 00:26:56,548
(ominous music)

408
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,798
I was beaten half to death by this man.

409
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:04,813
I was so scared that he would kill me

410
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:07,480
if I didn't give into his wants.

411
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:12,417
I charge this man with enslavement.

412
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:16,190
I charge you with sexual
molestation of my mind, body

413
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,043
and person.

414
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:19,971
(Landowner groans)

415
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,147
I charge this man with continuous rape!

416
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:25,064
(Landowner groans)

417
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:30,532
I would enslave him.

418
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:33,911
I would cut off his private parts!

419
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:35,232
- [Landowner] Oh, no, no.

420
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:37,956
- I'd work him and work him!

421
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,039
And work him!

422
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:43,650
He would feel the sting of my whip!

423
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:49,170
I would whip him and
whip him and whip him!

424
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,813
Until death would
relieve him of his agony!

425
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:01,060
- Thank you for your sworn
testimony, FLeurlilli.

426
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,154
- I would now call upon, for
the last of our testimony,

427
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:05,987
Belahsa.

428
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:09,454
(thunder cracks)

429
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,458
- When I was very small, your
people came to the field.

430
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:17,987
They chose me to be a
slave in your household.

431
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,904
I screamed and I cried.

432
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,808
I didn't want to be away from my mother,

433
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:25,808
my brothers and sisters.

434
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,758
They took me by the hair
and they dragged me.

435
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:31,841
But my uncle,

436
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:36,810
my beloved uncle with
his beautiful love for me

437
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,635
didn't want to see me taken to the field,

438
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,175
to the mansion.

439
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,804
To this man's mansion!

440
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,094
- But I didn't hurt you.

441
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:45,499
- He begged them.

442
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:46,454
He pulled on their arms, he pleaded

443
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:49,165
with them not to take me.

444
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:53,332
Until they hit him and knocked
him stiff into the ground.

445
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:59,174
They beat him with whips,
and then when one tired,

446
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:00,924
the others took over.

447
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,109
When he tried to cover
and protect himself,

448
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,344
they whipped him for doing it!

449
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:10,511
They whipped him to death!

450
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:14,730
- [Landowner] I didn't
do it, my men did it.

451
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,691
- For years, I couldn't erase
this vision from my memory.

452
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:23,041
I worked and slaved for
you, yet I hated you

453
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,291
for the murder of my uncle!

454
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:28,496
Ah, with this whip,

455
00:29:28,496 --> 00:29:31,079
I could slay you alive, mister.

456
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:35,397
I would whip you until the leather was red

457
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:38,868
with your blood and your
breath stopped blowing

458
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,110
within you.

459
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,081
(Landowner chokes)

460
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,164
I hate your guts, Master.

461
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:49,802
And when my arms gave
out from whipping you,

462
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:52,052
my sisters would take over.

463
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:56,342
I charge you with cruelty, enslavement,

464
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,757
and the murder of my uncle!

465
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,480
I would beat you dead for your crimes.

466
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,348
- And I, likewise,

467
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:11,371
would see this man blind and run to death.

468
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:13,954
And that death may be his fate.

469
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,907
- I will now call upon
Raybutta for her testimony.

470
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:35,077
- My fellow jurors, I saw this man

471
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,244
kill a 19-year-old boy!

472
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:46,582
19!

473
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,104
Why?

474
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,870
Because his wife, she wanted him!

475
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,637
She wanted his body pressed against hers!

476
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,276
And then he refused!

477
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,193
He refused!

478
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:11,431
So, he came to back door, and he made him,

479
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,635
made him confess to touching her!

480
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,150
(Landowner grunts)

481
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,983
I saw him!

482
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:25,792
I saw him!

483
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:31,443
He took and dragged and
beat this 19-year-old boy.

484
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:35,212
He covered him with tar.

485
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:39,150
And then he burned him.

486
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,047
- Help, help, help!

487
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:44,775
- Kill him!

488
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,967
(jurors yell)

489
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,908
(landowner gasps)

490
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,491
- Stop it, stop it!

491
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,075
- I will now call upon
Petrinah for her testimony.

492
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:05,742
(Thunder rolls)

493
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:15,498
- I, Petrinah,

494
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:22,025
charge you, an enemy of my country,

495
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,961
with the acts of treason!

496
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:34,190
With the acts of brutality
against my people!

497
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,523
Acts of murder, enslavement!

498
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,330
Some of our meager cash
resources with our purses

499
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,663
recovered from your baggage.

500
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:51,821
These acts against each and
every one of us present.

501
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:54,457
Will he draw execution
if they were perpetrated

502
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:56,319
against your people?

503
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,402
By any of us?

504
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,647
Your court would convict and execute us

505
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,454
without any hesitation.

506
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,121
For these same acts.

507
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm witness to your crimes.

508
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:13,190
I'm witness to your years of infamy.

509
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,690
Those things are unforgivable.

510
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:19,181
There must be a vengeance.

511
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,214
And eye for an eye.

512
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,286
A tooth for a tooth.

513
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,533
A life for a life.

514
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,701
I say death for you now!

515
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,233
Death for you now!

516
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,869
At the hands of this court.

517
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:38,786
(Landowner groans)

518
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:46,730
- You can't mean this,
you can't mean this.

519
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,715
- Please, please.

520
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:50,548
I protest.

521
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:54,263
No more speaking of death and killing.

522
00:33:54,263 --> 00:33:56,994
It is not for us to take this man's life,

523
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:59,400
or to spill his blood.

524
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,067
This man may be guilty of these crimes,

525
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,942
but here he lies under
our feet like an animal,

526
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,445
drugged into insensitivity.

527
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,945
Are to play God in
determining this man's fate?

528
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:15,052
In defense of this man, he
is not a totally evil person.

529
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,306
I have seen him at
times when he was a warm

530
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,918
and caring person.

531
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,001
Must it be we who play
the roles of executioners?

532
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,337
The Lord above may hold us
accountable if we take justice

533
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:29,308
into our own hands.

534
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:32,593
And the cast the venom of
our revenge against him.

535
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:34,128
- Etrosef,

536
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:36,961
this is a pig lying under my heel.

537
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,903
And unfeeling animal.

538
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,181
A worm.

539
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,270
He represents all that
is evil in our lives.

540
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,147
He and his people are the death of many!

541
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:55,064
And the near death of us ourselves!

542
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,644
God has charged us with the responsibility

543
00:35:00,644 --> 00:35:05,114
to bring this man to justice,
and answer for his crimes.

544
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:06,252
- No, no please.

545
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:10,419
- If we, the people, the
victims, cannot bring this man

546
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,625
to justice, who can, and who will?

547
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:25,470
- Butra, you say we are
empowered to legally judge,

548
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,980
convict, or exercise
punishment upon this man.

549
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,370
But should not another court
of the people bring him

550
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,537
to trial, and convict or
execute him for his crimes?

551
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,355
We must not have his blood on our hands.

552
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,272
(Landowner groans)

553
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:51,774
- You are right Etrosef,

554
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,228
we must not have his blood on our hands!

555
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:57,811
But consider it under our feet!

556
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:04,523
This scum must be brought
to justice here and now.

557
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,846
We must wipe the likes of him
from the face of the earth.

558
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:18,035
Since he has planned
escape and almost made it

559
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:20,879
without ever being brought to trial,

560
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,879
it is up to us that justice is done!

561
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:33,585
- We, we are the people of the court.

562
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:39,041
You are not only jurors, but
are giving sworn testimony

563
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:45,637
to the charges against this man.

564
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,387
I am presiding judge.

565
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,722
And together, we represent
the people of this land.

566
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:53,972
We are the law.

567
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:58,395
We are the law created out of chaos.

568
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:02,562
And it is our God-given
duty to prosecute this man.

569
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:07,633
And execute whatever
sentence this court decides.

570
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:10,133
(bell chimes)

571
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:17,216
Yes, yes we shall pause for
the feast of the elder's crown.

572
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:23,244
We will pause for the
holiday, and commence

573
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:25,244
with judgement tomorrow.

574
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:31,447
(Landowner groans)

575
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:34,164
- [Landowner] You can't
leave me here like this.

576
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,231
Let me outta here!

577
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:38,303
You can't leave me here in these chains!

578
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:39,136
- Mmm, oh.

579
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:39,969
- Shh.

580
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,679
(rhythmic music)

581
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,751
(ominous music)

582
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,828
- Mister Landowner!

583
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:18,103
(Landowner gasps)

584
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:22,637
A kick for every time you
took me against my will!

585
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:25,554
(Landowner grunts)

586
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,334
- Yes, it is I.

587
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:57,683
A whip for each month you
kept me as your personal slave

588
00:39:57,683 --> 00:39:59,100
and servant, too!

589
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:03,987
(Landowner cries)

590
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:21,685
(rhythmic music)

591
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,019
(Landowner groans)

592
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,930
- Dumping him down in the cellar.

593
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,396
They'll kill him before the trial's over.

594
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:42,860
- Can you blame them?

595
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,955
(Landowner groans)

596
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:46,788
- Stop!

597
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:49,985
- Get down, right now.

598
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:56,857
(Landowner yells)

599
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:59,607
(cheerful music)

600
00:41:33,278 --> 00:41:35,945
(intense music)

601
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,080
- No one's allowed.

602
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,356
- I know, my child, but please?

603
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:15,308
We need to show the Master
a little compassion.

604
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:18,330
- We put him in the
cellar to keep him safe.

605
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,239
- I know child, but please?

606
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,083
Just a little sip, child.

607
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,983
Show the man some compassion.

608
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,066
Just a little sip, child.

609
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,100
Please, child, please?

610
00:42:39,236 --> 00:42:41,105
God bless you.

611
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,772
(ominous music)

612
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:18,126
Hello, sir.

613
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:22,808
I'm Sister Mary Ellen, and
I'm here to pray for you.

614
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,975
- I don't need no prayers.

615
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:30,016
- Everyone needs prayers,
even the saints need prayers.

616
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:34,183
You sir, you need to pray and
ask God for your forgiveness.

617
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:37,969
- I don't need no damn forgiveness!

618
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:39,718
I ain't done nothin', I'm innocent.

619
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,559
I tell ya, I'm innocent.

620
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:44,726
- Sir, even the innocent needs prayer.

621
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:47,204
Jesus loves you.

622
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,948
Jesus forgives you for all
the crime that you committed.

623
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:53,067
Jesus loves you.

624
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,250
- I don't need no forgiveness for nothin'.

625
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,917
I have done nothin'.

626
00:43:57,781 --> 00:44:00,406
- Jesus will forgive you.

627
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:04,157
Jesus would take in all the
suffering that you caused

628
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:05,314
upon people.

629
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:08,373
All you need to do is ask for forgiveness.

630
00:44:08,373 --> 00:44:09,425
Pray.

631
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:11,410
- I ain't asking for no forgiveness.

632
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,581
What you got in that cup?

633
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,869
- I just have a little something for you.

634
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:17,628
I know you have to be thirsty.

635
00:44:17,628 --> 00:44:19,086
I'm compassionate.

636
00:44:19,086 --> 00:44:21,022
Just a little sip.

637
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:23,516
- Yeah, I am thirsty.

638
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:24,433
- Drink up.

639
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:27,027
There you go.

640
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:28,194
Drink up, yes.

641
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:31,750
Yes, drink it down!

642
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,050
Yes.

643
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,420
How's that feel?

644
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,663
- Good.

645
00:44:35,663 --> 00:44:36,496
- Yes.

646
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:39,007
Can you feel it?

647
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:39,840
Huh?

648
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:41,986
- Hey, hey.

649
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,054
- It's taking it's toll, huh?

650
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,383
Tastes good, huh?

651
00:44:48,383 --> 00:44:50,340
Would you like some more?

652
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,568
Just a little more.

653
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:54,009
Yeah.

654
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:56,494
It's working nicely.

655
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,740
Yes.

656
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,573
Yes, the poison is workin' nicely.

657
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:02,688
I'm no nun!

658
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:07,069
Does this look like a
nun's face to you, now?

659
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:09,367
I'm no Sister Mary Ellen.

660
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:10,724
This is no nun's face.

661
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:13,873
But you look, you look very closely!

662
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:15,777
Does this look familiar to you?

663
00:45:15,777 --> 00:45:17,366
It should!

664
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,785
Yes, it should!

665
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:21,618
Because you hurt me and my people!

666
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,497
You persecuted my people!

667
00:45:24,497 --> 00:45:26,753
Now, you're going to be judged!

668
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:29,083
You're gonna have a judge and jury,

669
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:31,650
and you gonna find you guilty!

670
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,150
Guilty as charged!

671
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:36,524
And now, you're gonna pay!

672
00:45:36,524 --> 00:45:37,782
You're gonna pay!

673
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:40,480
This how you treat my people!

674
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,978
You're gonna pay!

675
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:43,515
Yeah!

676
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:46,283
This is the poison takin'
it's toll upon you!

677
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:47,890
Ah!

678
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,723
Yes!

679
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:50,590
Yes!

680
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,940
Get in there!

681
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,993
I hate you!

682
00:45:53,993 --> 00:45:55,675
You killed my brother!

683
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:59,592
You killed my people,
and now you're gonna pay!

684
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,729
This is how you should be treated,

685
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:05,039
like a dog, like a bug!

686
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:07,551
Just stomped into the ground!

687
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:08,718
You gonna pay!

688
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,374
You!

689
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:13,933
You did this to my people!

690
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:17,513
And we had to work that plantation!

691
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:20,730
Months at a time, blood and sweat!

692
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,976
My brothers are dead!

693
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:25,019
My brothers are dead!

694
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,135
My people!

695
00:46:26,135 --> 00:46:29,218
And now you gettin' the same portion!

696
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:31,716
I hate you!

697
00:46:31,716 --> 00:46:34,625
And they, they're gonna persecute you.

698
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,994
You're gonna be judged and persecuted.

699
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,393
Guilty!

700
00:46:38,393 --> 00:46:40,118
Guilty, as charged!

701
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:44,877
Guilty for kicking my
people, killing my brother,

702
00:46:44,877 --> 00:46:46,377
my sister, guilty!

703
00:46:48,695 --> 00:46:52,035
This is all for the
suffering of my people,

704
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:55,130
and if they don't kill you, I'll come back

705
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,630
and make sure the job is done!

706
00:47:02,826 --> 00:47:05,743
(Landowner groans)

707
00:47:38,517 --> 00:47:39,767
Thanks, a lot.

708
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:42,538
I showed the Master a little compassion.

709
00:47:42,538 --> 00:47:43,371
Thanks.

710
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:56,433
(party music)

711
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:16,853
(intense music)

712
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:21,623
- What do you want in here?

713
00:48:21,623 --> 00:48:23,706
What do you want from me?

714
00:48:24,962 --> 00:48:26,545
What are you doing?

715
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,121
What are you doing?

716
00:48:38,738 --> 00:48:40,321
I treated you well.

717
00:48:41,864 --> 00:48:43,697
What are you plannin'?

718
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,156
No.

719
00:48:48,805 --> 00:48:50,388
What are you doin'?

720
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:53,982
What?

721
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:56,131
What?

722
00:48:56,131 --> 00:48:56,964
What are you doin'?

723
00:48:56,964 --> 00:49:00,337
(Landowner gasps)

724
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,240
(women kick)

725
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,157
(Landowner groans)

726
00:49:16,124 --> 00:49:17,650
- You know what you did to my sister.

727
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,885
I'm gonna make sure you never do it again.

728
00:49:19,885 --> 00:49:22,802
(Landowner groans)

729
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,780
(cheerful music)

730
00:50:07,898 --> 00:50:10,731
(Landowner cries)

731
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,289
- Please?

732
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:49,148
- Ah, go to hell.

733
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:50,418
You want some of the same?

734
00:50:50,418 --> 00:50:51,399
(woman kicks)

735
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:53,232
- [Landowner] No more.

736
00:50:54,379 --> 00:50:56,558
(Landowner groans)

737
00:50:56,558 --> 00:50:57,866
Cant' take no more.

738
00:50:57,866 --> 00:50:58,699
No.

739
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:01,856
(whip snaps)

740
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:03,342
- [Landowner Voiceover] Did
her whip her, clear then?

741
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:04,998
Run away will ya?

742
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:07,786
(woman cries)

743
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:10,109
(woman screams)

744
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,310
- [Landowner Voiceover] You like that?

745
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,507
You brand her?

746
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:14,154
Brand 'em all.

747
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,321
(mumbles)

748
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:19,109
- [Landowner] No.

749
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,462
No.

750
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:22,707
(woman kicks)

751
00:51:22,707 --> 00:51:24,499
(Landowner cries)

752
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,332
No more.

753
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,315
- [Woman Voiceover]
Don't you dare touch me!

754
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:30,369
Stand back!

755
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:31,326
No!

756
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:32,159
No!

757
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:35,394
- [Landowner Voiceover] Get her.

758
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:36,227
Get her.

759
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,612
You won't run away again.

760
00:51:40,612 --> 00:51:43,112
(whip cracks)

761
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:53,622
- Take that rifle, and you track her down,

762
00:51:53,622 --> 00:51:55,725
and you kill that little black bitch.

763
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:56,558
You understand?

764
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:57,391
(Landowner groans)

765
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:59,891
(woman kicks)

766
00:52:01,056 --> 00:52:03,367
- [Landowner Voiceover]
Sure do love killing.

767
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:04,200
Brand her!

768
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:08,367
(Landowner groans)

769
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:09,200
- Ah!

770
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:13,874
- [Landowner Voiceover] Shame
it didn't rip her arm off!

771
00:52:13,874 --> 00:52:16,594
Brand 'em and they won't run away again.

772
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:19,427
(Landowner cries)

773
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,357
(rhythmic music)

774
00:52:37,693 --> 00:52:39,860
(mumbles)

775
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,533
- He used this to beat me with.

776
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,038
- [Landowner] But I only
beat her once in a while.

777
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,371
And only when she needed it.

778
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:52,331
It's not negligence.

779
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,882
- Thank you, Your Honor,

780
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:06,933
for the clarifications and rights

781
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,830
of the privileges of this court.

782
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,330
We know he is guilty of all of inhumanity.

783
00:53:15,178 --> 00:53:19,345
Each of us here are witness
to his merciless crimes.

784
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:26,234
Of which is punishable by death,

785
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:28,817
a little ruin us in this court.

786
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,697
This man must be made an example

787
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:36,487
for those who were
before seized atrocities

788
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:39,570
against in our land, or in any other!

789
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:43,397
- [Landowner] Those weren't atrocities,

790
00:53:43,397 --> 00:53:44,464
those were my rights.

791
00:53:44,464 --> 00:53:45,547
I had rights.

792
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:50,525
- Sellahlie, you have
not spread you charges.

793
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:53,442
What say you for this man's crimes?

794
00:53:54,866 --> 00:53:55,949
- Jurors all.

795
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,513
Hear me.

796
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,620
I have seen many cruelties.

797
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:09,415
Many more than I care to recall,

798
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:13,082
and many more than you
could ever see again.

799
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,733
Many were perpetrated,

800
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,076
by this evil, Satanic man!

801
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:34,044
We were forced to lick
the foot of his kind

802
00:54:36,366 --> 00:54:37,616
and his people.

803
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:44,644
And while we were licking, we
were kicked into licking more.

804
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:47,537
- [Landowner] We had to stay in control.

805
00:54:47,537 --> 00:54:49,636
We needed control.

806
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:52,386
- I prayed and prayed for the day

807
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,160
he licked my foot!

808
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:02,677
My shoe!

809
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:07,902
(mumbles)

810
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:11,069
I have prayed and prayed for that day!

811
00:55:17,508 --> 00:55:20,583
- I beg Your Majesty, that we allow her

812
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,486
this little pleasure.

813
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,553
What say you lady jurors?

814
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:25,924
- [Jurors] Yes!

815
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:27,334
- [Butra] That is yes, Your Majesty!

816
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:30,887
To order the prisoner to oblige by licking

817
00:55:30,887 --> 00:55:33,887
the dirt clean off Sellahlie's foot.

818
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:38,646
- [Wateesa] Yes, and so it be.

819
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:43,240
The prisoner is so ordered.

820
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,323
I order you to obey, now!

821
00:55:48,774 --> 00:55:49,607
- Lick it!

822
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,347
Lick it clean, as all your
people have forced us to do.

823
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:57,453
- [Landowner] No, no, I have money.

824
00:55:57,453 --> 00:55:59,101
I have much money.

825
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:00,235
I'll give you all money.

826
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:01,568
- You had money!

827
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,977
You thought you would escape.

828
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:09,241
But, we have your money, now.

829
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,574
It rightfully belongs to us.

830
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,300
This court has called for the

831
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,467
(mumbles)

832
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:18,664
You have nothing left to

833
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:20,606
(mumbles)

834
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:22,515
We all have it.

835
00:56:22,515 --> 00:56:23,515
Have it all.

836
00:56:24,356 --> 00:56:27,273
Now, lick as you have been ordered!

837
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,533
Lick now!

838
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:34,289
Before I crush you to
the floor with my spike!

839
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,693
That's the way!

840
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:45,172
That's where he belongs!

841
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:46,589
Licking our feet!

842
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,448
Forever!

843
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,367
Now, I say to you and to you lady jurors,

844
00:56:55,897 --> 00:56:58,887
is this not an admission of guilt?

845
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:00,307
- [Jurors] Yes!

846
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:01,140
Guilty!

847
00:57:05,397 --> 00:57:09,082
- Let this not differ our minds with pity.

848
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:11,561
Now that we've observed
this wretch doing what

849
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,721
he should have been doing
since the day he was born.

850
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:15,823
- [Landowner] I gave you everything.

851
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:17,433
Clothes, money, shoes, jewelry!

852
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:18,266
You--

853
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:21,668
- Now, are there more charges?

854
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:25,665
- Yes, Your Majesty.

855
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:29,391
We the jury charge this man

856
00:57:32,841 --> 00:57:36,424
with rape, enslavement,
plunder and treason

857
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:41,787
against our country!

858
00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:44,954
The very act of terrorism, and murder.

859
00:57:48,483 --> 00:57:49,483
- Very well.

860
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:53,669
Since this man has no defense, whatsoever,

861
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:57,836
for his crimes, and since I
have been given free choice

862
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:03,160
to decide the method in
which he is to be executed,

863
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:08,059
you will cast your ballots first.

864
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:11,281
A unanimous decision is not necessary.

865
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:12,698
A majority rules.

866
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,783
If he is found not guilty,
he will be set free.

867
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:23,139
He will walk away unharmed.

868
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:27,257
All of his earthly
possessions returned to him

869
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:28,201
- [Jurors] No!

870
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:29,034
Never!

871
00:58:30,997 --> 00:58:33,914
- If, however, you find him guilty,

872
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:37,533
he will die.

873
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:50,033
And he will be executed
according to your wishes.

874
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:53,296
- [Landowner] You don't
have rights to say that.

875
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,796
- You may now cast your votes.

876
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,825
- You're right.

877
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:04,896
We the jurors have decided
upon an act of compassion.

878
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,237
We have decided that
our prisoner should be

879
00:59:12,237 --> 00:59:14,108
further trusted.

880
00:59:14,108 --> 00:59:16,710
His mind, then, will allow more

881
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,266
(mumbles)

882
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:21,599
of what other sentence imposed upon him,

883
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,225
should this jury find him guilty.

884
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,417
- [Landowner] No, no drugs.

885
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:32,917
- This court will let the prisoner decide.

886
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:37,384
- [Landowner] I dislike
the fact I saw a fist.

887
00:59:37,384 --> 00:59:39,787
No more, no drugs, no drugs.

888
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,378
Whiskey, whiskey.

889
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,711
Gimme some whiskey, whiskey.

890
00:59:46,052 --> 00:59:49,052
(Landowner gurgles)

891
00:59:58,765 --> 00:59:59,598
Whiskey.

892
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,298
(Landowner gurgles)

893
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:05,798
(horn sounds)

894
01:00:09,915 --> 01:00:12,332
- Your wish has been granted.

895
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:17,128
Butra, you may proceed with the ballots.

896
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:21,668
- Lady jurors, please cast your votes,

897
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:26,636
and then place them in the holder.

898
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:33,548
- I repeat to you for clarity,

899
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:39,856
a unanimous decision is not necessary.

900
01:00:41,893 --> 01:00:43,476
The majority rules.

901
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:49,679
I trust that you will cast your ballots

902
01:00:50,628 --> 01:00:53,461
as your hearts have spoken to you.

903
01:00:54,473 --> 01:00:55,306
Go.

904
01:00:55,306 --> 01:00:57,423
- [Landowner] You're
full of, you're crazy!

905
01:00:57,423 --> 01:00:58,590
You're crazy!

906
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,915
You can't make the law, yet!

907
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:02,814
That's why you're all crazy, you fools!

908
01:01:02,814 --> 01:01:05,126
- You are wrong, we are the law!

909
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:07,255
The newly acclaimed law!

910
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:08,088
- Yes!

911
01:01:08,088 --> 01:01:12,622
- We are judge, jury and
executioner in your case.

912
01:01:12,622 --> 01:01:13,571
- [Jurors] Yeah!

913
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:14,863
That's right!

914
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:17,580
(Landowner groans)

915
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,536
- [Landowner] Wait, wait,
wait, don't be foolish.

916
01:01:20,536 --> 01:01:21,911
I have much money to give you!

917
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:23,021
I have money hidden.

918
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:25,100
I have money hidden.

919
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:29,267
- As we have told you, we are
not interested in your money.

920
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:35,267
We have confiscated all
your ill gained bounty.

921
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:38,988
We are interested that justice be done.

922
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:40,924
- [Landowner] But I've
already given you everything.

923
01:01:40,924 --> 01:01:42,579
I've given you so much!

924
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:47,071
You can have it all,
you can have everything.

925
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,236
Wait, wait, I beg you.

926
01:01:49,236 --> 01:01:50,510
I beg you!

927
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,681
Please, please?

928
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:54,201
I will get money, I will pay you all.

929
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:56,606
I will pay, pay well.

930
01:01:56,606 --> 01:01:59,739
I have money in other
places, I'll pay you all.

931
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:00,989
Please, please?

932
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:05,084
- As God is my judge, I am your judge.

933
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:09,250
And you will not be set free.

934
01:02:10,823 --> 01:02:14,990
But you will be sentenced
by the will of this court.

935
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:18,016
- [Landowner] Wait, wait.

936
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:19,882
You don't have any authority to do this.

937
01:02:19,882 --> 01:02:23,358
You have my weapons, and your
chains are cutting my wrists,

938
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:25,691
but you still can't do this!

939
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:32,184
(thunder rolls)

940
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:48,404
- Suhya, collect the ballots.

941
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:21,381
Guilty.

942
01:03:28,423 --> 01:03:29,256
Guilty.

943
01:03:38,374 --> 01:03:39,291
Not guilty.

944
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,607
(jurors murmur)

945
01:03:52,056 --> 01:03:52,889
Guilty.

946
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:06,245
Guilty.

947
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:18,792
Guilty.

948
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,262
Guilty.

949
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,823
Guilty.

950
01:04:45,994 --> 01:04:47,327
And now my vote.

951
01:04:51,348 --> 01:04:52,181
Guilty!

952
01:04:53,213 --> 01:04:55,520
The verdict is death!

953
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,075
- No!

954
01:04:57,075 --> 01:04:57,908
Oh, no!

955
01:05:02,224 --> 01:05:04,669
No, you're all fools.

956
01:05:04,669 --> 01:05:06,287
You're all fools!

957
01:05:06,287 --> 01:05:09,673
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

958
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,423
Your plenty of fools.

959
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:15,440
- We are the law.

960
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,975
The newly acclaimed law.

961
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:21,975
We are judge, jury and
executioner in your case.

962
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,153
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

963
01:05:31,153 --> 01:05:33,070
Please, please, please.

964
01:05:35,113 --> 01:05:35,946
My slaves.

965
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,733
I have much money.

966
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:42,872
I have a way to give you wealth.

967
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,394
I have a way to give you money.

968
01:05:45,394 --> 01:05:47,130
Please release me.

969
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,435
Please release me.

970
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:50,057
I will give you money.

971
01:05:50,057 --> 01:05:53,584
I have jewels, I have, I will give you--

972
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:57,604
- As we have told you, your
money has been confiscated

973
01:05:57,604 --> 01:05:59,442
by this court.

974
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:01,344
We are not interested in your money,

975
01:06:01,344 --> 01:06:03,427
but that justice be done.

976
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,699
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

977
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:08,059
I have money elsewhere.

978
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:10,196
Money, money that you didn't get.

979
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:11,389
I will pay you all well.

980
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:13,693
I will pay you all well!

981
01:06:13,693 --> 01:06:14,713
Release me.

982
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:16,496
I will pay you well.

983
01:06:16,496 --> 01:06:19,000
I will make you wealthy.

984
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,401
I will give you much money.

985
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:24,568
- As God is my judge, I am your judge.

986
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,533
You will not be set free.

987
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:33,879
But you will be sentenced by this court.

988
01:06:33,879 --> 01:06:37,296
And according to the wishes of my jurors.

989
01:06:38,646 --> 01:06:40,905
- No, no please, please, please.

990
01:06:40,905 --> 01:06:44,510
Please, please, I beg of you, please!

991
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:48,048
- Silence from you now, or
this weapon will put an end

992
01:06:48,048 --> 01:06:49,298
to your crimes.

993
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:56,900
Now jurors, you will vote again.

994
01:06:58,338 --> 01:07:02,836
This time for one of the
four methods I have selected

995
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:04,336
for his execution.

996
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,940
I have chosen these alternatives
from all of the crimes

997
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,273
from which he has committed.

998
01:07:14,938 --> 01:07:19,021
Number one, he will kneel
before me, blindfolded,

999
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:27,420
then be shot by his former
slave, now queen and judge.

1000
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:36,058
Number two, he will be
hanged by each and every one

1001
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:40,930
of you.

1002
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:46,563
Rope stretched taughtly
around his neck until the life

1003
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,727
is gone from him.

1004
01:07:52,143 --> 01:07:56,060
Number three, he will be
knifed, stabbed again,

1005
01:07:58,399 --> 01:08:03,032
and again, and again, until
the blood drains from his body.

1006
01:08:03,032 --> 01:08:06,750
He will be stabbed again and again,

1007
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,833
until life ebbs from him.

1008
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:17,036
Number four, he will be trampled to death.

1009
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:25,493
He will be stomped to slime
under the heels of our shoes.

1010
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:31,052
He will be pulverized, and
his remains will lay open

1011
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:32,635
on the bare ground.

1012
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:38,289
He will be trampled until his
remains seep into the earth.

1013
01:08:40,744 --> 01:08:44,219
- [Landowner] You can't do this.

1014
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,164
- Butra, you shall now
instruct your main jurors

1015
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:49,997
to cast their ballots.

1016
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:52,934
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1017
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:56,017
Lady jurors, please cast your ballots

1018
01:08:57,062 --> 01:08:59,395
for the matter of execution.

1019
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:02,567
Number one, he will be shot!

1020
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,911
Number two, he will be hanged!

1021
01:09:11,134 --> 01:09:14,551
Number three, he will be knifed to death!

1022
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:22,838
Number four, he will be trampled
by the heel of our shoes!

1023
01:09:28,925 --> 01:09:31,342
He will be trampled to death!

1024
01:09:32,313 --> 01:09:33,506
- [Landowner] No, no!

1025
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:35,935
I bought and paid for all
the clothes you're wearing,

1026
01:09:35,935 --> 01:09:38,674
all those clothes, all
those shoes, the jewelry.

1027
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,600
They belonged to my wife.

1028
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,210
Everything you're wearing.

1029
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,572
It's not right.

1030
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:45,572
You can't do this to me.

1031
01:09:47,814 --> 01:09:50,147
- Again, the majority rules.

1032
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:55,415
A unanimous vote is not necessary.

1033
01:09:56,473 --> 01:09:59,140
(jurors murmur)

1034
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:10,989
- Suhya, collect the ballots.

1035
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:44,533
Suhya will now read the ballots.

1036
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:54,280
- The first ballot is for
number one, to be shot.

1037
01:10:56,427 --> 01:10:59,594
The second ballot is for number three,

1038
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:02,918
to be executed by the knife.

1039
01:11:07,623 --> 01:11:10,706
The third is to be trampled to death.

1040
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:26,917
The fourth ballot is for
number four, trampling.

1041
01:11:36,242 --> 01:11:39,878
The fifth ballot is for
number four, to be stomped

1042
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:42,045
and trampled to the death.

1043
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:54,290
The sixth ballot is trampling.

1044
01:12:09,323 --> 01:12:13,406
The seventh ballot is for
number one, to be shot.

1045
01:12:17,558 --> 01:12:21,225
The eighth ballot is
number four, trampling.

1046
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:28,309
And the ninth ballot is
for number four, trampling.

1047
01:12:38,648 --> 01:12:41,648
- And now, for the final vote, mine.

1048
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:47,634
I cast my ballot for
number four, trampling.

1049
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:56,548
Ladies of the jury, the verdict is clear.

1050
01:12:56,548 --> 01:12:58,131
Trampling to death.

1051
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:06,435
We shall now and at this
moment, execute sentence

1052
01:13:07,645 --> 01:13:08,478
upon the

1053
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:12,802
(Landowner drowns out Wateesa)

1054
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:14,040
- [Landowner] You have no rights.

1055
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,973
You have no rights to
sentence me to anything.

1056
01:13:16,973 --> 01:13:19,857
You have no rights at
all, you can't do this,

1057
01:13:19,857 --> 01:13:21,707
it's not right, you can't sentence me.

1058
01:13:21,707 --> 01:13:24,207
(woman kicks)

1059
01:13:26,474 --> 01:13:28,495
(Landowner cries)

1060
01:13:28,495 --> 01:13:31,249
- More whiskey, more whiskey please?

1061
01:13:31,249 --> 01:13:32,205
More whiskey?

1062
01:13:32,205 --> 01:13:33,288
More whiskey?

1063
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:39,144
(Landowner gurgles)

1064
01:13:41,988 --> 01:13:43,959
(woman kicks)

1065
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:48,126
- The time for leniency
and compassion is now over.

1066
01:13:49,764 --> 01:13:52,681
You will now receive your sentence.

1067
01:13:53,982 --> 01:13:56,399
(gong rings)

1068
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:01,530
- Murderers!

1069
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:05,231
You'll all be murderers.

1070
01:14:05,231 --> 01:14:06,890
Murderers!

1071
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:09,022
- As you have been.

1072
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:11,272
And now, an eye for an eye.

1073
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:17,357
Do not fear, our heels
high and sharp will strike

1074
01:14:17,357 --> 01:14:19,274
you swiftly as bullets.

1075
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:24,009
Your death will come
quickly, I assure you.

1076
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:26,087
- [Landowner] Oh, no.

1077
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,004
- Justice will be done.

1078
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:36,004
Now ladies of the jury,
take your positions

1079
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:37,504
for the execution.

1080
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:55,058
Now ladies of the jury,
take your positions,

1081
01:14:57,294 --> 01:15:01,461
and on the count of three,
drive your spikes deeply

1082
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:05,062
and with a vengeance, and power.

1083
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,709
- [Landowner] No, please
don't do this to me!

1084
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:11,539
I don't deserve to die this way.

1085
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:12,706
Don't do this!

1086
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,191
