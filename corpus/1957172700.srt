00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:10,127
Okay, so it's
Proverbs 27, verse 19.

1057
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,432
Okay?

1058
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,088
"As in water,
face answereth to face,

1059
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:17,569
so the heart
of man to man."

1060
00:52:19,092 --> 00:52:22,139
- I don't know
the "answereth."

1061
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:25,272
- Okay, let me
break it down for you.

1062
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,708
Okay. So the first part:

1063
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:29,842
"As in water,
face answereth to face."

1064
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,365
See, when you look
into the water,

1065
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:33,672
you'll see a reflection
of your face.

1066
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,891
Right? And so,
take the second part

1067
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:38,938
and explain to me
what it means.

1068
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:40,505
- Wait, so...

1069
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:42,115
they're both
about reflections?

1070
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:46,554
When you know your heart,

1071
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,731
then you can understand
someone else's.

1072
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,517
- Right.

1073
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:58,740
Uh, what does
that mean to you?

1074
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:00,612
- Well, um...

1075
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,614
that we're all the same,
deep down.

1076
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:04,877
Um, even though
we may seem different.

1077
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:06,661
- Exactly.

1078
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:10,056
See? There's no way Mrs.
Stewart can keep you off choir--

1079
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:13,973
Sorry.

1080
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,628
You know, I just--
I overheard her talking to you.

1081
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:19,457
- It's just
a little embarrassing. Uh--

1082
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:21,372
I don't know if I'm gonna
pull it off, you know?

1083
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:23,330
- Yeah, you will.

1084
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:25,289
- Thanks for your help,
though.

1085
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:26,855
- I wasn't helping you.

1086
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,161
I was just, you know,
looking out for choir.

1087
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,555
- Okay, okay. My bad.

SAVANNAH:
Yeah, trust me. I know.

1089
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:36,038
Miles can be
pretty ridiculous.

1090
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,388
But...other than that,

1091
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,346
are you starting to feel
more at home?

1092
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:41,783
- I'm getting there.
It's just my Hawthorne crew's

1093
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,307
being kind of tough
on me, you know,

1094
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:46,223
and I just
didn't expect that.

1095
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,789
But...I know
that God will only

1096
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:50,749
put as much on my plate
as I can handle.

1097
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,012
Just gotta keep praying
and stay positive.

1098
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,709
- Yeah. I don't know.

1099
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:58,365
Sometimes I think I have
a little too much on my plate.

1100
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:00,193
- What do you mean?

and yearbook

1103

all fell
on the same day.

1104
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,074
- That's not true at all.

1105
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,425
What? You think you're
the only one that has it rough?

1106
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:15,730
- Come on.

1107
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,689
- You don't know
anything about me.

1108

- Uh, I'm pretty sure
I have a good idea.

1109

I know that you're
the pastor's daughter,

you're in every club.

I mean, what's the worst
that could've happened?

is saying much, but...

to miss a parent.

I don't wanna think about my
mom and be sad. I want--

I want thinking about her
to make me happy.

Mrs. Howell?

- This is hard.

1146
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,177
Okay. You all know

1147
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:56,570
that it's been
a very rough year

1148
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:59,225
for the church
and the community.

1149

Despite all of

we've still fallen short.

We're out of ideas,
and we're out of money.

1152

Hawthorne will be
closing its doors

- What?

1155

- Hawthorne
can't shut down.

will we go?

1159
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,638
- There must be something
we could do.

1160
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,204
- What if we win
the prize money at states?

1161
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,554
ALL: Yeah.

1162
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:25,077
- Yes, that would help
pull us through,

1163
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:28,297
but we don't have money
to send you to states.

1164
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,648
And that is too much pressure
to put on you.

this competition.

Can't you figure
something out?

this was our opportunity

could do something.
