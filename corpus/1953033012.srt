1
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,923
<i>To all things, there is a purpose. </i>

2
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,720
<i>It was the time of the judges. </i>

3
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,490
<i>The Lord had punished the children</i>
<i>of Israel for their sins against him. </i>

4
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,770
<i>He had delivered them</i>
<i>into the hands of the Philistines. </i>

5
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>Conquerors of the people of Israel... </i>

6
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,277
<i>... they exploited their empire</i>
<i>with cruel efficiency. </i>

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,944
<i>But they were also</i>
<i>an advanced people. </i>

8
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,745
<i>In a world of bronze, </i>
<i>they had discovered the secret of iron. </i>

9
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:05,619
<i>And with this, they crushed any</i>
<i>disobedience swiftly and without mercy. </i>

10
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,940
<i>God's punishment</i>
<i>of the people of Israel was severe... </i>

11
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,976
<i>... but he did not abandon them. </i>

12
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:31,583
<i>And their faith grew in their struggle</i>
<i>against their Philistine oppressors. </i>

13
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,951
Do not fear, woman.

14
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,483
The Lord of life has not forgotten you
in your barrenness.

15
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:53,394
I am the messenger come to tell you
that your womb will bear fruit.

16
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,764
You will conceive a son,
a Nazarite dedicated to God.

17
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,998
He will eat no unclean food
and drink no strong drink.

18
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:05,200
And he will grow stronger
than a hundred men.

19
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,075
He is the Lord's gift,
chosen to begin the liberation...

20
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,081
... of your people from the Philistine.

21
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:17,154
Look through me, and you will see
where his future lies.

22
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,556
As a mark of obedience to the Lord...

23
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:23,695
... his hair shall never be cut.

24
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,026
This shall be the symbol
of his alliance with God...

25
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,394
... and of his consecration to him.

26
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:32,401
His strength resides in the Lord.

27
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,563
This secret is his and yours alone.

28
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,643
Do not break this pact
with the almighty.

29
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,803
Manoah!

30
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,934
A man back there at the well...

31
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,644
A strange man. Listen to me.

32
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:16,405
He appeared to me at the well.

33
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,276
- A Philistine?
- No.

34
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,213
No. A stranger.

35
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:22,683
- What are you talking about?
- Listen to me.

36
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,913
"The Lord of life, " he said.

37
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,557
He said...

38
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,855
... I would conceive
and give birth to a son.

39
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:36,725
And if he said we were rich,
would you believe that too?

40
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,529
He was an apparition. It was...

41
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,763
It was like a miracle.

42
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,575
Mara...

43
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,908
... you are barren.

44
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,845
You know that.

45
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:02,025
I have lain...

46
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,491
... with no one but you, Manoah.

47
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,626
The child will be ours.

48
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:14,668
And a gift to our people.

49
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,844
<i>And the land yielded its harvest. </i>

50
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:29,476
<i>And upon it, God began to sow</i>
<i>the seeds of justice for his people. </i>

51
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:31,747
<i>For they did not bow down</i>
<i>their heads... </i>

52
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:35,086
<i>... or worship the false idols</i>
<i>of their masters. </i>

53
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,801
<i>But after 40 long years... </i>

54
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:54,069
<i>... deliverance was at hand</i>
<i>for the children of Israel. </i>

55
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:58,011
<i>Their prayers had been heard</i>
<i>by the God with no face... </i>

56
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,310
<i>... and a name that is never spoken. </i>

57
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,715
<i>The one true God. </i>

58
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,828
Do you...

59
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:20,126
... want to hold him?

60
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,830
But he's so small.

61
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,134
I might drop him.

62
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,408
- Amen.
- Amen.

63
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,201
Samson.

64
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:25,089
Father...

65
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:28,888
... how will I know when it is time
to fulfill my destiny?

66
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,764
The Lord will tell you.

67
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:35,866
- When?
- When the time is right.

68
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,239
- A sign?
- Perhaps.

69
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,138
What kind of a sign?

70
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,040
I don't know.

71
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,111
He gave you strength.

72
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:48,808
He will also give you understanding.

73
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,623
I am but one man. One.

74
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:59,159
A Nazarite bonded to the Lord.

75
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,357
There's no need to search for signs.

76
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,528
Your birth was the sign.

77
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,941
The stranger said,
"Chosen to deliver his people"?

78
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,553
Those were his words.

79
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,621
To deliver his people.

80
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,331
It will be hard.

81
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,162
Every gift is also a burden.

82
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:05,091
- Father says he's lazy.
- And slow-witted.

83
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,188
Samson.

84
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:16,935
Put them in the net!

85
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:18,835
- Samson.
- Let me down.

86
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,408
- Samson, no.
- Let me out of this net now.

87
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:23,977
Samson, get us down.

88
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:27,382
Samson, get us out of here.

89
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,752
Stop, Samson. Stop.

90
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,817
- Let me out.
- Samson, stop now.

91
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:36,014
- Let me down out of this net.
- Samson.

92
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,059
- Samson.
- Let us down.

93
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:41,763
Let us down now!

94
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:48,763
<i>Samson was gentle, </i>
<i>good, thoughtful... </i>

95
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:53,398
<i>... and unsure, as all men are, </i>
<i>of the purpose of his life. </i>

96
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:57,205
<i>He began to walk the long road</i>
<i>to understanding and faith. </i>

97
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:01,543
<i>A journey which must be made</i>
<i>by every man alone. </i>

98
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:15,254
That's it, Your Highness. That's it.
Watch your guard.

99
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:18,761
<i>In the palace of the king</i>
<i>of the Philistines... </i>

100
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,729
<i>... another young man</i>
<i>was learning the skills of life... </i>

101
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,895
<i>... through the games he played. </i>

102
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:29,574
Watch your guard.

103
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:51,560
Intelligence, attention, concentration.
I watch you.

104
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:55,602
You're like a butterfly.
You're here, you're there, you're gone.

105
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,034
Focus your attention.

106
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,901
Your Highness...

107
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,734
... focus your mind completely.

108
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,703
Yes. Yes, I know.

109
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,015
Try again, general?

110
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:13,884
As you wish, Your Highness.

111
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:21,256
Never underestimate your enemy.

112
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,999
No, Father.

113
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,567
- Good day, Delilah.
- General Tariq.

114
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,711
You may rise.

115
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:44,307
I wonder what her father would
think of her now, eh, commander?

116
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:46,783
A true friend and a fine soldier.

117
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:49,651
Who, I'm told, never underestimated
his enemy.

118
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:53,258
Here, use this one, commander.

119
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:56,626
- An Israelite sword.
- What's an Israelite sword?

120
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,129
Bronze.

121
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,162
They're a very primitive people.

122
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:03,327
Who have only ever found
a single god to worship.

123
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,170
Attack.

124
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:13,178
Even a broken sword will kill you...

125
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:15,942
... if you let down your guard,
Your Highness.

126
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:19,348
You remind us every day
of the reasons why my father...

127
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,045
... values you so highly, commander.

128
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,851
He's possessed
of a soldier's most powerful weapon:

129
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,751
His intelligence.

130
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:56,251
<i>My name is Yoram. </i>

131
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:58,984
<i>I was more than 10 years younger</i>
<i>than Samson. </i>

132
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,094
<i>I loved him as a brother. </i>

133
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:05,027
<i>We were both Nazarites, </i>
<i>dedicated to God at birth. </i>

134
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,127
<i>Did I know even then... </i>

135
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,601
<i>... that within him</i>
<i>lay the destiny of our people?</i>

136
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:14,773
<i>Perhaps I knew only that I would be</i>
<i>with him until the end. </i>

137
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:57,881
There was no warning?

138
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:01,644
The Philistines came
from over there...

139
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,091
... out of the sunset.

140
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,192
There was no time to run.

141
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:12,263
And we had no arms.

142
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,999
My father...

143
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,032
... my mother...

144
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,173
... and my brothers.

145
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:26,913
They killed them all.

146
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,345
I was not spared but overlooked.

147
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:36,419
The only one who escaped.

148
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:45,694
Naomi...

149
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,230
... I'm sorry.

150
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,036
Sorry?

151
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:54,301
For bringing back that memory.

152
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:57,107
It never leaves.

153
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:07,244
Come with me. You will hear.
You will learn.

154
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:09,953
Please, Samson. Come with me.

155
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:12,582
For me.

156
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:16,695
For you, anything.
Except one of those meetings.

157
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,163
I have to go.

158
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,167
Naomi...

159
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,998
... you are far too gentle
for the harsh words of rebellion.

160
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,436
And you can hardly even lift a sword.

161
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:32,738
- It is you who has been chosen.
- I doubt it.

162
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,247
- Your mother refuses...
- Naomi, stop this.

163
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,510
If I am to be called,
God will call me.

164
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,346
Not you and your rabble.

165
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,288
I am a Nazarite.

166
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:48,952
I pray. I try.

167
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:52,231
But there is a great absence.

168
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:59,938
Seas can open, Samson.
Bushes can burn.

169
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,665
For Moses and for you.

170
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:07,242
I am one man. How can one man
destroy the Philistines? Tell me.

171
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,476
- Our army will...
- Your army has wooden clubs...

172
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,210
... and swords of bronze.
- And righteousness.

173
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:16,753
Why is it that every people think
they alone are the righteous ones?

174
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,754
You doubt it?

175
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:23,729
Anyway, righteousness never stopped
the Philistine spear that killed your mother.

176
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:28,463
Righteousness did not give them
weapons of iron.

177
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,074
Do not make me beg.

178
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,407
Open your eyes.

179
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,704
I have seen nothing.

180
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:43,974
I have heard nothing.

181
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:48,045
- I am nothing.
- A man is what he chooses to be.

182
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,423
And I choose nothing.

183
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,049
Why?

184
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:56,989
Tell me, Samson.
What are you frightened of?

185
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,663
Nothing.

186
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:03,694
- Then what do you want?
- I want...

187
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:05,936
... everything.

188
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,009
Come, come.

189
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:39,157
How is it, Ira...

190
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:43,324
... that we are still bent
beneath the heel of these Philistines?

191
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:45,060
It's God's punishment.

192
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:47,136
When our people
abandoned his ways...

193
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:50,969
... he brought them down on us
that we might atone for our sins.

194
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:53,270
But things are better than they were.

195
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,377
No more burned villages...

196
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,812
... no more young people
taken into slavery.

197
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:01,350
And the fruit of suffering...

198
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,953
... is wisdom.

199
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:06,658
Then we must be
the wisest people on earth.

200
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:08,525
Ira...

201
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,586
... you are the elder of our village.

202
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:15,330
- I need your counsel.
- It's freely given...

203
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,894
... and often wrong.

204
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,302
What's Samson done now?

205
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,568
Nothing. And more nothing.

206
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,975
He leads an empty life.

207
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,139
It's as if he believed
the world owed him something.

208
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:33,945
Moses, too, was raised as a prince.

209
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:36,913
My sons are just the same.

210
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:40,250
And without Samson's special gifts.

211
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:44,792
"Samson caught us in the net.
Samson caught us in the... "

212
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,793
Tell me. Has Samson ever cried?

213
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:52,698
For one hour after he was born.

214
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:57,599
It's as if he feared the pain
that life had in store for him.

215
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:02,645
- Since then, never.
- Truly, he is remarkable.

216
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:05,841
His temperament is kind,
his wit is quick.

217
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,518
And his strength...

218
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,883
He has all the gifts but one:

219
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,956
Purpose. It is the fuel of life.

220
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:18,389
Come on.

221
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,959
Come on.

222
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:27,894
Pull.

223
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,384
- Naomi.
- What?

224
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,317
Maybe we should go.

225
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,049
They come by every day
at about this time.

226
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:53,829
No. It's your turn, Yoram.

227
00:22:57,969 --> 00:22:59,903
Go on. It's your turn.

228
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,934
- Come on. Philistines. Let's go.
- No.

229
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:09,005
Go. Fetch Samson, quickly.

230
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,114
Hey!

231
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,248
I've never seen goats riding on goats.

232
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:27,859
Why don't you get off
and milk them, huh?

233
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,060
Go.

234
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:40,310
Does the smell come from the beasts
or from the masters, huh?

235
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,243
Samson!

236
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,715
Samson, come quick!

237
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,012
The Philistines, they have Naomi.

238
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,553
Samson, please hurry.

239
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,714
Move away. Move.

240
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:02,797
Come on. Come on, quickly!

241
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,058
Come on, let's go.

242
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,303
Pig!

243
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:19,806
Your mother was a donkey.
And yours, a mule.

244
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,880
Hold her.

245
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,583
I have two swords here.

246
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:33,524
Impaling you with either
will give me great satisfaction.

247
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:35,757
Best be the iron one.

248
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,265
Save the other for your mother.

249
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,364
Israelite whore.

250
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:00,657
- Naomi, stay there. I'll help him.
- No, no.

251
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:02,053
Stay here.

252
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:12,358
Samson!

253
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,277
Get out!

254
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:26,844
Go!

255
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,244
Go!

256
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,128
You broke them!

257
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,526
Without a weapon, Samson broke them.

258
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,862
You have been chosen.
How can you doubt it?

259
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,804
Samson!

260
00:25:55,979 --> 00:26:00,075
Without a weapon, Samson broke them.

261
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:16,024
Please, Manoah. Let us in.
At least talk to these people.

262
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:20,294
You know us all. There's nothing
that we don't give to this house.

263
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,768
I'm not letting any of you in here.
Go now.

264
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:25,373
- You hear me? I said, now.
- This is important.

265
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,535
Mara, you must speak to him.
We need him. A leader.

266
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,705
- Someone our people will stand with.
- I need him too.

267
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,180
- Mara, these are the...
- I know who they are.

268
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:38,788
- Carpenters, shepherds, plowmen.
- The leaders of our rebellion.

269
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:42,948
Rebellion. How many weapons
do you have? How many made of iron?

270
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,923
Mara, God's will brought us your son
to destroy the enemies of our people.

271
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:50,293
Manoah, you must speak to Samson.

272
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:53,231
- With his father's urging, he might...
- What am I to urge?

273
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:56,471
That he die before his time?

274
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,635
The son Mara and I prayed for
all our life.

275
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:02,403
- Manoah, listen to us.
- I've heard you.

276
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,638
Our son is the Lord's instrument.

277
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:07,840
And in the Lord's time, he will obey.

278
00:27:08,018 --> 00:27:12,011
In God's good time. Not in yours.

279
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:16,922
You should have insisted.

280
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:21,125
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- I don't know, you were there.

281
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,231
You saw how...

282
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,594
Oh, Lord, tell me what to do.

283
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,536
Enslave him, Father.

284
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,339
Burn his village before the Israelites
rally to a new hero.

285
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:40,840
There is nothing to be gained
by burning an Israelite village.

286
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:43,713
- In a week, it will be old news.
- Legends grow, Father.

287
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,150
Ask your courtiers
what they have heard.

288
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:50,019
Single-handed, two patrols.
Some say 10.

289
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:55,762
Only an empty head
can be full of these tales.

290
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,501
And what do you think,
Commander Tariq?

291
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:05,196
I think all people need their heroes.

292
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,539
If they don't exist,
they must create them.

293
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:11,069
- You know what it means?
- What?

294
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,942
- His name, Samson.
- Tell me.

295
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:18,245
- "Son of the sun. "
- The son of the sun.

296
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:22,315
And your name.

297
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:23,786
Mine?

298
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:27,325
"Delilah, " it's an ancient word.
It means "desire. "

299
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:29,691
And do you think that appropriate,
commander?

300
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,260
In every way.

301
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:37,703
But the son of the sun.

302
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:42,074
I'd like to see this Samson for myself.

303
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:45,673
You're a loose woman, Delilah.

304
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:47,781
And if I weren't...

305
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,384
... I'd find that remark offensive,
general.

306
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,486
His hair is long.

307
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,452
He wears it in seven braids.

308
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,893
Some kind of religious significance.

309
00:29:01,296 --> 00:29:02,888
Is there anything you don't know?

310
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:06,796
I'll never know how
to please a loose woman.

311
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,168
Our requests of a man
are very modest.

312
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,070
That is the principal part
of our charm.

313
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:17,511
Only by very modest request...

314
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,910
... could any man
meet your expectations.

315
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,382
Except perhaps this Israelite hero.

316
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:31,886
Men like him are either
quickly forgotten...

317
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:36,896
... or never forgotten.
- Nothing certain, eh?

318
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:40,230
Nothing but death.

319
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:44,403
Is that it? It seems very little.

320
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,905
And encompasses everything.

321
00:32:57,331 --> 00:32:58,662
No!

322
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,659
Strong, yes,
but with a sweet modesty.

323
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:44,463
Did you see how he ran?
Like a gazelle.

324
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:47,197
A woman would die for a man like that.

325
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,739
Out of the way, fool.

326
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:54,340
A gazelle is so much more graceful
than a baboon, is it not?

327
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:56,614
General?

328
00:34:57,016 --> 00:35:00,543
If the future of our people
is to be secured...

329
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:05,453
... perhaps the time has come
to think of different stratagems.

330
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:07,549
Such as?

331
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:10,423
The greatest victory
any general can achieve.

332
00:35:11,097 --> 00:35:12,758
Peace.

333
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:19,869
I knew something had happened.

334
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,371
You haven't been fighting
over a woman, have you?

335
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:26,477
All the single girls are in love with you.
Some of the married ones too.

336
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,670
- It wasn't a fight over Naomi, was it?
- No.

337
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:30,440
- Who then?
- No one.

338
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:34,311
- I saw...
- Saw what?

339
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,612
A woman...

340
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:40,217
... like no other.
- No woman gave you these wounds.

341
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:42,623
Samson, be careful.

342
00:35:53,473 --> 00:35:54,701
Father.

343
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:56,899
- Father...
- Now, wait.

344
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:00,905
- General, continue.
- Well, it would take time.

345
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,675
But once they saw how a lasting treaty
would benefit them...

346
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,751
... we could focus
our attention elsewhere.

347
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,380
- A treaty? With who? What is this?
- This is something kings must learn...

348
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:13,355
... and princes must practice.

349
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:16,825
- It's called listening.
- No one in this royal house should listen...

350
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:19,829
... to any proposal for a treaty
with the tribes of Israel.

351
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:22,058
Their subjugation is their treaty.

352
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:24,396
It's only by listening that one hears.

353
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,597
The general's proposals have merit.

354
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:30,106
- Continue.
- Lf we might consider...

355
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:34,269
... making official peace with them,
turning them into independent allies...

356
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,176
Allies? The Israelites?

357
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,074
Better to plunge your hand
into a basket of vipers.

358
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:44,450
The art of making a decision
is firstly to know what your choices are.

359
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,014
General.

360
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,420
What would we achieve by having
a vassal state on our eastern borders?

361
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:57,262
Nothing but a breeding ground
for rebellion, draining my manpower...

362
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,869
... and your treasury.
- Our treasury.

363
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,039
You always know
where I'm vulnerable, eh?

364
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:08,675
But we would allow them access
to the sea and allow them to trade.

365
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,782
My experience of life,
beginning with my own family...

366
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,043
... is that by giving some
of what is wanted...

367
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:17,052
... only whets the appetite for more.
- We would continue...

368
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:19,213
... to maintain complete control, Majesty.

369
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,524
The illusion of independence.

370
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:25,561
It would take a magician
mightier than any I've met.

371
00:37:25,731 --> 00:37:27,722
And their religion? No, no, general.

372
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,129
Beliefs are more dangerous
than a hundred armies.

373
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:32,633
Our gods have the tail of fish...

374
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:35,898
... because our ancestors
were seafaring people.

375
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:39,976
What does it matter if a handful of our
people decide to believe in a single deity?

376
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,613
- It's poor exchange.
- Perhaps so.

377
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:47,114
But I sometimes feel that a single sun
in the sky is better than two or three...

378
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:48,878
... that would burn us all alive.

379
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:52,023
But if we control
the Israelites by a treaty...

380
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,488
No, commander. This is treason.

381
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,629
You do not accommodate an enemy.
You eliminate him.

382
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:59,296
At what sacrifice?

383
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:02,165
A thousand of our young men?
Five thousand?

384
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:05,064
How many widows do you want to make
before you say enough?

385
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:07,705
The Israelites lay claim
to our kingdom...

386
00:38:07,939 --> 00:38:10,407
... and we are contemplating
giving it to them?

387
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:12,975
No. Only that we make peace...

388
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:15,641
... the price for which is small.

389
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:20,341
They believe their god
will send them a savior to destroy us.

390
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:25,646
It is, above all else, this foolish belief
that holds them in our power.

391
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:28,354
They wait patiently, passively.

392
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,020
Perhaps we should be encouraging them
in this belief.

393
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:36,224
We should make an example
of their new hero, this Samson.

394
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:37,894
Before it's too late.

395
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,163
Draw them too close,
and they will discover...

396
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:42,899
... one of the secrets of our power,
how to make iron.

397
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:44,838
That is true.

398
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,410
- Perhaps there are ways...
- You wish them to learn...

399
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,513
... how to make real weapons, general?

400
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:53,412
Well, this year, next year.
Whatever. They will learn.

401
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,347
Man climbs upon
the shoulders of man.

402
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:59,689
But a treaty is not the answer.
It's too dangerous.

403
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:02,520
Let us leave them as they are,
waiting for their savior...

404
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:05,424
... and hope he does not come
till our reign...

405
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,861
... and yours are no more
than great memories.

406
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:12,926
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- You're my first general.

407
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:17,240
And what is a first general
without an army?

408
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:20,271
What is a scorpion
when it loses its sting?

409
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:26,875
Your Highness.

410
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:35,959
Will you mourn me
after my death, Sidqa?

411
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:39,562
Of course, Father.

412
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,557
Very good.

413
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,265
I want you to contact our agents.

414
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,696
Arrange for the capture
of this Samson.

415
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:49,302
You will command
the operation yourself.

416
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:52,403
I want him brought back
to Gaza. Alive, if possible.

417
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:56,675
- Alive?
- Yes, alive. Living, not dead.

418
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:58,347
More difficult, but essential.

419
00:39:58,516 --> 00:40:01,917
- But it may be they already believe.
- Myths and legends wrap themselves...

420
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:05,146
... around the dead
and make them martyred heroes.

421
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,085
They are remembered.

422
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:10,253
I want this Samson
brought back here to Gaza.

423
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:13,158
A prisoner. In chains of iron.

424
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:15,789
He'll be quickly forgotten.

425
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:32,146
Here is your money.
Now show us where he lives.

426
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,541
A stranger.

427
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,880
He said...

428
00:41:08,452 --> 00:41:09,885
He said...

429
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,738
Come, brother.

430
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:36,309
Our work is done here.

431
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:19,320
Father!

432
00:42:25,129 --> 00:42:28,064
- Mara! Mara! Are you hurt?
- Please, God...

433
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,070
Please, God, help him.
Samson!

434
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:38,139
What are you doing?
Where are you taking him?

435
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,503
- Let him go!
- Samson!

436
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:43,001
Stay where you are.

437
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:45,907
With Samson gone,
we shall lead the rebellion.

438
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:50,046
People will look to us to inspire them.

439
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,382
They'll bring their hopes,
fears, doubts to us.

440
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:56,650
We will become the true judges
of Israel.

441
00:42:57,226 --> 00:43:00,457
See there in the stars...

442
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:04,064
... when Samson has been netted.

443
00:43:10,073 --> 00:43:11,973
Help him! Help him!

444
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:14,040
Stop them!

445
00:43:15,478 --> 00:43:17,708
You've got no right to do this!

446
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,576
- What is happening?
- They've taken Samson.

447
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,047
What?

448
00:43:25,555 --> 00:43:27,182
Where are they taking him?

449
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:34,152
Do something. Help him!

450
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:36,264
Do something!

451
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:39,228
Yoram, come on. Come on!

452
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:48,368
Samson! Let me through!

453
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,571
Go! Take him!

454
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:04,491
- Samson!
- Go! Seize him! Go!

455
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:08,723
Stay back.

456
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:15,929
You, go on!

457
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:41,355
Manoah.

458
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:47,696
Go! Stop him!

459
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,104
You, get him!

460
00:44:54,644 --> 00:44:56,043
Go on!

461
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:37,976
Where were you? We outnumbered them
by more than 100.

462
00:45:40,222 --> 00:45:42,156
Lead you?

463
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:47,087
Shall I kill him for you too?

464
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:54,401
- Where are you going?
- Kill him yourself.

465
00:45:54,603 --> 00:45:57,470
- Samson!
- Samson!

466
00:46:01,977 --> 00:46:04,673
Cowards! Traitors!

467
00:46:11,153 --> 00:46:14,054
- We should have stayed to watch.
- No.

468
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:17,552
Being at home asleep
proclaims our innocence.

469
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:20,623
He'll be halfway to Gaza by now...

470
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:23,490
... in chains of iron.

471
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,327
Lord!

472
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:30,965
Lord!

473
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:38,436
Yoram.

474
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:41,741
- We'll find somewhere to hide you.
- Hide me?

475
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:43,678
They might come again.

476
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:46,012
- Let them.
- Come.

477
00:46:46,521 --> 00:46:50,423
You have a friend,
one who will never betray us.

478
00:46:57,699 --> 00:46:59,530
How many of them were there?

479
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:02,067
We outnumbered them
by more than 100.

480
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,999
- You fought them like 200.
- God is good.

481
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:09,675
Not one of them tried to help.
Except you.

482
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:13,872
The others begged rebellion of me
one day and abandoned me the next.

483
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,247
- They were frightened.
- And you weren't.

484
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:20,614
I'm not old enough to know better.

485
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:22,654
Nor are my parents.

486
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:28,621
Naomi cracked a few skulls.

487
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:32,965
Love is a powerful conqueror of fear.

488
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:48,474
Surely if he had been taken...

489
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:52,084
... Father would have been told.
He would have awoken us by now.

490
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:54,953
Father is asleep, and he's...

491
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,784
Where would he go?

492
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:59,785
They have to come back.

493
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:11,872
All the laws we have to live by
are so difficult to keep.

494
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:17,340
Part of our strength is giving support
to each other.

495
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:22,742
And helping each other...

496
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:28,244
... and guiding each other
will reveal this temptation.

497
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,122
You were dedicated
a Nazarite at birth?

498
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:38,057
- Yes. Like you, I belong to the Lord.
- We belong to the Lord.

499
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:42,235
He is a strange master who tells
us nothing, asks nothing of us.

500
00:48:42,403 --> 00:48:44,337
His ways are unknowable.

501
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:47,039
He moves beyond our understanding.

502
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:49,400
Or not at all.

503
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,007
He gave you strength enough
to break a lion's neck.

504
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:57,774
You knew.

505
00:48:58,385 --> 00:48:59,909
You what?

506
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:02,317
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

507
00:49:04,058 --> 00:49:06,117
There are many ways to be strong.

508
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:12,328
Samson. What are you... ?

509
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:15,367
- We heard voices.
- What's he doing here?

510
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:19,633
The Philistines tried to capture him.
He beat them back.

511
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:21,035
- He did?
- God be praised.

512
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,698
Yes. God be praised.

513
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:27,411
- With him here, we will all be in danger.
- What if they come back again?

514
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:29,912
- Tonight?
- They won't look here.

515
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:32,176
If they come back again,
search the village?

516
00:49:32,353 --> 00:49:34,514
- Then what?!
- We'll be taken to Gaza in chains!

517
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,156
He can't stay here!

518
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,019
Jehiel, Amram, leave us.

519
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:46,357
If you are in fear of your lives...

520
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,827
... find another place to sleep.
- Father...

521
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:53,069
- The Philistines...
- lf the Philistines come, they come.

522
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:57,444
- Now, leave us!
- Come, brother.

523
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:03,042
My son.

524
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,578
Has your father ever told you
how proud he is of you?

525
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,052
But my sons...

526
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:14,717
"Samson caught us in a net.
Samson caught us in... "

527
00:50:14,895 --> 00:50:16,556
A net.

528
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,932
How else did they know
where you slept?

529
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:22,059
Jehiel.

530
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,466
Amram.

531
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,033
Oh, no.

532
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:34,605
No.

533
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:38,978
No. My own sons.

534
00:50:42,222 --> 00:50:44,315
Traitors. Fools!

535
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:47,688
If a man sins against another,
God may intervene in his favor...

536
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:52,594
... but if a man sins against the Lord
and his consecrated, who shall intercede?

537
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,064
Father, somebody's been lying to you.

538
00:50:56,003 --> 00:50:58,494
Jehiel. Amram.

539
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,171
- They betrayed me.
- Samson, no!

540
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:07,211
- We haven't sinned, Father.
- You have disgraced me.

541
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:11,441
- We haven't...
- My own sons have torn out my heart.

542
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:15,614
No, Samson!

543
00:51:15,788 --> 00:51:17,813
- No!
- Samson, no.

544
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,049
You beg for once, only to die.

545
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:21,989
No!

546
00:51:29,702 --> 00:51:32,034
Samson, don't kill them. I beg of you.

547
00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:42,679
Samson. Samson!

548
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:47,917
We thought that we were attacked
by a superior Israelite force.

549
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:50,988
You keep telling me
they have no superior force.

550
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:53,057
Never underestimate the enemy.

551
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,662
In the circumstances, I thought it
prudent to withdraw, to regroup.

552
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:01,698
- Back here in Gaza?
- Well, ready for another day.

553
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,336
But he was just one man.

554
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:07,297
- One man.
- But with the strength of 50.

555
00:52:07,473 --> 00:52:09,498
- And others attacked us.
- With bare hands?

556
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,905
It was dark. Who knew what weapons?

557
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:14,308
Did they all have
the jawbone of an ass?

558
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:19,176
The gods give an ignorant
Israelite peasant Samson for a son...

559
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:23,083
... and they give me the king of Gaza.

560
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:25,313
You.

561
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:28,722
I have but one duty,
that's to outlive my heir.

562
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:32,786
Is there no justice in the stars?
Get out of my sight.

563
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:38,969
- Father...
- Are you deaf as well as brainless?

564
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:41,737
I said, get out of my sight. Go.

565
00:52:52,885 --> 00:52:54,944
I want an emissary to inquire...

566
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:57,214
... and report to me
on exactly what happened.

567
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,119
Yes, my lord.

568
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:13,501
Well, General Tariq,
is there justice in the stars?

569
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,504
Apparently not.

570
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:20,337
The number of kings who outlive their heirs
does not give us grounds for confidence.

571
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:39,591
Samson!

572
00:53:42,668 --> 00:53:45,193
- Samson.
- Go back to the village.

573
00:53:45,371 --> 00:53:47,805
- Where are you going?
- Away. I don't know.

574
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:49,872
Samson, I am lost without you.

575
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:52,567
Ever since I was born,
you've been there.

576
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:54,938
Since I was born I've been told...

577
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:58,277
... that God punished our people
because they failed to heed him.

578
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:02,444
Perhaps if I can distance myself
from my people for a while...

579
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:06,850
... I can hear his word and obey.

580
00:54:07,626 --> 00:54:09,025
Go.

581
00:54:09,194 --> 00:54:10,923
Back to the village.

582
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:14,993
Now your manhood begins.

583
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:17,934
As does mine.

584
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:27,715
I wouldn't if I were you.

585
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:43,902
Looking is one thing, but touching...

586
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:45,974
... that's something else.

587
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:49,402
The men could turn nasty,
and you could end up...

588
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,038
... with one less body part than God
gave you, if you know what I mean.

589
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:57,211
You're an Israelite.

590
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:59,220
Amrok.

591
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,654
Lost in the desert as a child.

592
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:05,324
Raised by the Philistines.

593
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:09,223
A wanderer by upbringing,
and a curious man by nature.

594
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:10,593
Homeward bound after...

595
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:14,231
... three weary years of putting one foot
in front of the other.

596
00:58:14,404 --> 00:58:16,031
- And you?
- Samson.

597
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,406
I expected a giant, a wrestler.
But you look like any other man.

598
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:26,913
- You are the one they speak of?
- And betrayed.

599
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:30,749
But you, an Israelite, have lived
amongst the Philistines.

600
00:58:30,988 --> 00:58:33,456
I was taken in by a family.

601
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:36,482
- Good people.
- How could you live with them...

602
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,493
... when they crushed your own people
under their heel?

603
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:42,530
Have you seen so little of life
that you don't know?

604
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:47,563
When a people are controlled
by a strong king...

605
00:58:47,738 --> 00:58:50,434
... it is the king's will that prevails,
not the people's.

606
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:53,440
It wasn't the king who destroyed
our villages in the old days.

607
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:58,274
Yes, but those who did are fed by him,
advanced by him, rewarded by him.

608
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:00,307
The court controls everything.

609
00:59:00,484 --> 00:59:02,850
If men devised a weapon
to destroy the courts...

610
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,250
... in one single blow,
all of Gaza is destroyed.

611
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:07,117
They are cruel people.

612
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,825
- Because they are afraid.
- Afraid?

613
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,752
Of losing what they have.

614
00:59:12,996 --> 00:59:15,931
If you could drive them into the sea
and take their land...

615
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:19,694
... you would, wouldn't you?
- Right now I would not raise my finger...

616
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,634
... against them.
- Then we can be friends.

617
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:24,101
Friend.

618
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:26,735
The prince of the Philistines
seeks my head.

619
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,504
Friendship with me
could be dangerous.

620
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,413
The best friendships are always risky.

621
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:35,675
The prince who seeks your head
must first find his own.

622
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,619
Tomorrow night we'll feast
with my father in Timnah.

623
01:00:09,118 --> 01:00:10,745
Timnah.

624
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,020
- Are these your father's fields?
- As far as the eye can see.

625
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,925
You chose your parents well.

626
01:00:49,992 --> 01:00:51,516
- Hello.
- Amrok.

627
01:00:51,694 --> 01:00:53,594
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

628
01:00:53,796 --> 01:00:56,026
Master. Master!

629
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:57,961
- How is your wife?
- Master.

630
01:00:58,134 --> 01:00:59,362
Your son.

631
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,264
- Your son is back!
- Thank you.

632
01:01:01,437 --> 01:01:03,769
Master. Your son. He's come back.

633
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:22,916
Let me speak for you. Then everything
will be all right, you'll see.

634
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,993
My son.

635
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:28,929
My son, my son.

636
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:35,732
Father, this is Samson.

637
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,835
- Samson?
- Yes. My Israelite friend.

638
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:44,405
Samson, this is my father.

639
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:48,815
If you are my son's friend...

640
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:51,578
... then you are my honored guest.

641
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:55,556
My house is your house.

642
01:01:58,894 --> 01:02:01,260
- Rani.
- Amrok.

643
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:04,928
Dear brother.

644
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:09,367
Samson, this is my sister, Rani.
Rani, this is Samson.

645
01:02:23,886 --> 01:02:25,683
This is for your wife.

646
01:02:29,725 --> 01:02:32,421
- Oh, this is beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

647
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:03,648
It is beautiful.

648
01:03:04,392 --> 01:03:09,352
Only sung by women in the presence
of a man at certain times.

649
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:54,900
Samson.

650
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:58,869
Drink.

651
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:07,879
Thank you.

652
01:04:08,623 --> 01:04:10,090
Wait, wait.

653
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:13,894
I saw you once before
in the land of the Israelites.

654
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,822
- It was only for a moment.
- You were working in a field.

655
01:04:20,468 --> 01:04:23,369
- I remember.
- You remember.

656
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:25,769
As you do.

657
01:04:42,423 --> 01:04:44,948
Do you ever dream, Sidqa?

658
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:47,356
Yes.

659
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:49,754
I do.

660
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:53,723
Since I was a child,
I have never dreamed.

661
01:04:53,968 --> 01:04:55,435
Never.

662
01:04:57,305 --> 01:04:59,796
The doctors tell me
you're getting stronger.

663
01:05:00,408 --> 01:05:02,069
That's true.

664
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:06,578
You thought your time had come,
didn't you, Sidqa?

665
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:09,376
A little longer.

666
01:05:09,918 --> 01:05:12,113
A little longer.

667
01:05:14,222 --> 01:05:16,884
Child, tell me what it is you want.

668
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:20,185
If it is within my power,
I shall grant it.

669
01:05:22,196 --> 01:05:23,891
I want...

670
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:26,055
I want...

671
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:27,896
Yes?

672
01:05:28,503 --> 01:05:31,233
I want Samson as my husband.

673
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,468
He is a good man.

674
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,801
But is he not an enemy of our people?

675
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:40,970
Not of mine.

676
01:05:42,582 --> 01:05:45,779
- You love him?
- With all my heart.

677
01:05:47,354 --> 01:05:49,879
Has he spoken words of love to you?

678
01:05:50,691 --> 01:05:54,718
A woman sees the heart of a man
through the doorway of his eyes.

679
01:05:56,263 --> 01:05:58,026
And you see... ?

680
01:05:59,232 --> 01:06:03,259
A man who loves me as I love him.

681
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:11,209
- That's what she said?
- Her exact words.

682
01:06:12,946 --> 01:06:17,246
But could she truly love me,
an Israelite...

683
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:21,444
... as a wife must love her husband?
Is such a thing possible?

684
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:25,552
My mother and father would say,
"Never. "

685
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:28,320
My teacher would say, "Think again. "

686
01:06:28,996 --> 01:06:31,260
And have you thought again?

687
01:06:32,265 --> 01:06:34,233
It is all I think of.

688
01:06:35,102 --> 01:06:38,128
And each time the thought
fills me with happiness.

689
01:06:39,706 --> 01:06:41,640
Then the question is...

690
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:46,471
... could you truly love her, a Philistine,
like a husband must love his wife?

691
01:06:49,249 --> 01:06:53,117
As surely as the sun dies
beyond the hills each night.

692
01:06:54,154 --> 01:06:56,247
Come and speak to her.
Tell her how you feel.

693
01:06:56,423 --> 01:06:58,323
- She knows. She sees it.
- Yes, she knows.

694
01:06:58,492 --> 01:07:01,859
But women like you to tell them.
Especially if it's the truth.

695
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:30,347
And what about these stories
that he has slain our soldiers...

696
01:07:30,524 --> 01:07:33,687
... that the Israelites beg him
to lead their army against us?

697
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,191
He's here.

698
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:39,087
He refused them, and they betrayed him.
He's a man of peace.

699
01:07:39,399 --> 01:07:40,923
As am I.

700
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:43,894
You know him now.

701
01:07:44,071 --> 01:07:46,232
You know he's an honorable man.

702
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,306
Will you, that are kind and just...

703
01:07:49,476 --> 01:07:52,411
... let rumor or gossip stand in his way?

704
01:07:52,579 --> 01:07:55,548
It is said he humiliated
Prince Sidqa himself.

705
01:07:55,715 --> 01:07:57,740
From what we are told,
this is not difficult.

706
01:07:57,918 --> 01:07:59,146
True.

707
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:02,254
But if they found
he was hiding in my home...

708
01:08:02,422 --> 01:08:04,754
... if they came for him...

709
01:08:04,925 --> 01:08:07,120
I'm not thinking of myself.

710
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:09,262
But the danger to you...

711
01:08:09,429 --> 01:08:10,657
... to Rani...

712
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,033
They would surely kill us all.

713
01:08:18,538 --> 01:08:20,062
Father, I am an Israelite.

714
01:08:20,273 --> 01:08:21,672
- You are my...
- Hear me out.

715
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:23,742
- You are my son.
- Hear me out.

716
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,810
I'm an Israelite.

717
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,912
But I honor you as my father.

718
01:08:28,514 --> 01:08:30,948
Perhaps Rani's love for him...

719
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:33,745
... is the very way towards peace
between our two peoples.

720
01:08:34,587 --> 01:08:36,851
And the king himself is wise.

721
01:08:37,022 --> 01:08:38,683
Is he not?

722
01:08:40,226 --> 01:08:41,659
Well...

723
01:08:42,595 --> 01:08:45,393
... if I were to send a message to Gaza...

724
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:48,826
... if the king gave it his blessing...

725
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:53,097
Then all would be well.

726
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:17,994
This farmer from Timnah is a traitor.

727
01:09:19,265 --> 01:09:22,428
- You must deny his request.
- Sidqa...

728
01:09:23,102 --> 01:09:26,560
... when I'm gone and the throne is yours,
let me give you a word of advice:

729
01:09:26,739 --> 01:09:30,641
Always, always ignore
those of your counselors...

730
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:33,606
... who say "you must. "

731
01:09:34,413 --> 01:09:35,778
But, Father...

732
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:39,042
... now we know where Samson is.
- Yes, my son.

733
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:41,347
Now we know.

734
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,756
A Timnite woman.

735
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:55,159
They're supposed to be very beautiful,
are they not?

736
01:09:55,334 --> 01:09:59,031
If she were that beautiful,
she'd be here, in the palace.

737
01:09:59,305 --> 01:10:00,966
If you say so.

738
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:04,272
Do not humor me, commander.

739
01:10:04,443 --> 01:10:06,741
I'd hate to think
you believe me jealous.

740
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:08,775
And are you jealous?

741
01:10:09,148 --> 01:10:11,343
- What's the man to me?
- I don't know.

742
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:14,852
He saved your life.

743
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,681
I owe him thanks.

744
01:10:17,523 --> 01:10:19,491
No more than that.

745
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:22,852
So he is unimportant.

746
01:10:23,028 --> 01:10:24,586
Nothing.

747
01:10:25,864 --> 01:10:28,230
Then why are you telling me
about him?

748
01:10:30,636 --> 01:10:33,935
Because I tell you
what I hear in the court.

749
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:35,573
And I you.

750
01:10:35,874 --> 01:10:40,743
And the arrangement makes us
both formidably well informed.

751
01:10:48,554 --> 01:10:54,186
So the poor Israelite is to be denied
even one night of marital pleasure.

752
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,385
You feel sorry for an enemy
of our people?

753
01:10:57,563 --> 01:11:01,693
Enemy? Where are his armies?
Whose downfall does he seek?

754
01:11:02,735 --> 01:11:04,726
You're remarkable, Delilah.

755
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:07,167
I had assumed that you
would share the anger...

756
01:11:07,339 --> 01:11:09,068
... of our prince with this Israelite.

757
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:11,766
The prince and I
have very different tastes.

758
01:11:13,545 --> 01:11:15,877
The prince will never be known
for his taste...

759
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:18,240
... but for the size of his feet.

760
01:11:21,452 --> 01:11:24,182
He'll never fit his father's shoes.

761
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,385
You know, General Tariq...

762
01:11:31,562 --> 01:11:33,723
... I've known you all my life.

763
01:11:34,632 --> 01:11:38,124
But at this moment,
I know you not at all.

764
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:40,927
I'm a man...

765
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,839
... in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

766
01:11:46,978 --> 01:11:49,344
For whatever it's worth...

767
01:11:49,614 --> 01:11:52,879
... I too have known myself
all my life...

768
01:11:54,252 --> 01:11:56,618
... and yet not at all.

769
01:12:01,259 --> 01:12:03,022
Cut it out.

770
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,528
My son.

771
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,142
Mother? Yoram.

772
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,678
Sit. Drink. You've traveled far.

773
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,442
So is it true?

774
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:33,783
Is what true, Mother? That I live and work
here among people who ask nothing of me?

775
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,552
- Yes, that is true.
- You know of what I speak.

776
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,992
The story is abroad.
Everyone speaks of it.

777
01:12:39,163 --> 01:12:41,529
That you are to marry a Philistine.
Is that true?

778
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:44,065
Her name is Rani. Yes, it is true.

779
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:48,934
The ceremony is tomorrow.
And you are welcome.

780
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:50,934
I'm glad you're here.

781
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:53,700
Among all the women
you might have chosen...

782
01:12:53,878 --> 01:12:56,676
... was it God's will that you bring
a stranger to your bed?

783
01:12:56,848 --> 01:12:58,577
She is a good woman.

784
01:12:58,783 --> 01:13:01,752
Her father is honorable, just and kind.

785
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,784
- And I love her, Mother.
- And is this love...

786
01:13:05,957 --> 01:13:08,517
... greater than the bonds
that tie you to our people?

787
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:11,061
Greater than our traditions?

788
01:13:11,629 --> 01:13:15,030
Do not turn your back on us
by marrying a foreign woman.

789
01:13:16,134 --> 01:13:19,968
Come back with us, Samson.
Before it's too late.

790
01:13:20,304 --> 01:13:21,965
My home is here now.

791
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:25,732
You have punished us enough.

792
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,606
- I beg you.
- I have heard you, you have heard me.

793
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,475
That is an end to it.

794
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:33,244
Beware this woman, Samson.

795
01:13:33,418 --> 01:13:35,386
Be it on your wedding day...

796
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:38,147
... or within the first circle
of the moon...

797
01:13:38,322 --> 01:13:40,586
... she will betray you.

798
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:46,125
- My father.
- You have no father.

799
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,629
- And he has no son.
- Mother.

800
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,590
Yoram.

801
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:52,929
Mother!

802
01:14:06,517 --> 01:14:09,008
See? I bleed.

803
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:11,949
Like any other man.

804
01:14:24,601 --> 01:14:27,161
<i>Samson stayed in the land</i>
<i>of the Philistines... </i>

805
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,635
<i>... where he had found</i>
<i>a woman he loved. </i>

806
01:14:29,806 --> 01:14:33,139
<i>And it seemed the king had given</i>
<i>his approval for the marriage. </i>

807
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:37,677
<i>But those he sent to celebrate</i>
<i>had come for another purpose. </i>

808
01:14:37,881 --> 01:14:41,317
<i>And thus did Samson 's love</i>
<i>for the Philistine woman... </i>

809
01:14:41,485 --> 01:14:44,477
<i>... begin to fulfill the word of God. </i>

810
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,625
Philistines.

811
01:15:26,997 --> 01:15:29,363
Philistines.

812
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:32,698
I give you a riddle.

813
01:15:33,203 --> 01:15:35,501
What's the prize?
There has to be a prize.

814
01:15:35,672 --> 01:15:37,401
Yes, there must be a prize.

815
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,001
Very well. If you solve the riddle...

816
01:15:40,544 --> 01:15:43,638
... 30 linen garments.
- And a flock of sheep.

817
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:47,305
And two shepherds.
And 100 silver pieces.

818
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,150
Out of the eater...

819
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:53,050
... something to eat.

820
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:56,519
Out of the strong...

821
01:15:56,893 --> 01:15:58,793
... something sweet.

822
01:16:00,163 --> 01:16:01,187
Impossible.

823
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,690
Out of the strong?
This is Samson himself.

824
01:16:04,634 --> 01:16:06,033
No.

825
01:16:15,345 --> 01:16:18,508
- Tell me the riddle, Samson.
- Why, so you may win the prize?

826
01:16:18,682 --> 01:16:20,582
No. To share in your enjoyment...

827
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,184
... as I hope to do
throughout our life together.

828
01:16:23,353 --> 01:16:26,845
- I don't think that that's...
- Tell her. She's your wife.

829
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:28,953
No secrets.

830
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:32,561
- A man must trust his wife.
- You won't trust me?

831
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:40,528
Excellent. You'll never get it.

832
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:45,998
My husband not only trusts me,
he gives you a true riddle to solve.

833
01:17:13,102 --> 01:17:15,502
You keep your guests very happ y.

834
01:17:15,671 --> 01:17:18,139
I'm glad you're enjoying our wedding.

835
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,706
The king is well pleased, Harach.

836
01:17:20,876 --> 01:17:22,503
Good. Good.

837
01:17:22,678 --> 01:17:25,112
He honors us with your company.

838
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:29,148
And will bestow more honor
with the answer to this riddle.

839
01:17:29,318 --> 01:17:30,751
The riddle?

840
01:17:35,357 --> 01:17:37,382
I need a pretext.

841
01:17:37,893 --> 01:17:39,360
A reason.

842
01:17:39,528 --> 01:17:41,587
A reason? For what?

843
01:17:46,168 --> 01:17:50,730
A reason not to seize your land,
cut off your thieving fingers.

844
01:17:51,006 --> 01:17:52,496
Sir, you are my guest.

845
01:17:52,675 --> 01:17:55,303
- This is outrageous.
- The answer. I will have it.

846
01:17:56,378 --> 01:17:57,902
Go.

847
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,638
Fetch it from your daughter.

848
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:02,511
Before I order your house
burned to the ground.

849
01:18:21,637 --> 01:18:23,036
Rani.

850
01:18:23,272 --> 01:18:24,296
Rani.

851
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:28,438
- Come here, Rani. Come.
- My father calls.

852
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:31,579
Then go to him. But return to me.

853
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,541
All right.

854
01:19:38,847 --> 01:19:41,680
Come, Samson. We submit.

855
01:19:43,152 --> 01:19:45,245
Tell us the answer to your riddle.

856
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:48,556
A Philistine submit to an Israelite?

857
01:19:48,924 --> 01:19:51,552
- Shame.
- A father submits to his son.

858
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:55,288
You will never get to bed with my sister
until this riddle is solved.

859
01:19:56,865 --> 01:19:58,389
Now there's a good reason.

860
01:20:02,103 --> 01:20:03,400
All right.

861
01:20:04,205 --> 01:20:05,763
All right.

862
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,498
All right.

863
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:09,939
- I see I have you all.
- All?

864
01:20:10,278 --> 01:20:11,939
No.

865
01:20:14,582 --> 01:20:18,518
- The answer is plain.
- Tell us.

866
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:22,547
What is sweeter than honey?

867
01:20:23,591 --> 01:20:27,049
And what is stronger than a lion?

868
01:20:33,401 --> 01:20:34,993
It is surely a honeycomb.

869
01:20:36,204 --> 01:20:38,832
A beehive inside...

870
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,974
... the entrails of a desert lion.

871
01:20:48,416 --> 01:20:50,350
Right? The lion and the honey.

872
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:52,644
That's right, you have it.

873
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:57,682
That's no riddle.

874
01:20:58,392 --> 01:21:00,986
How could anyone guess
an answer like that?

875
01:21:05,566 --> 01:21:06,794
How indeed?

876
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:16,874
Wife.

877
01:21:26,954 --> 01:21:29,787
Why, Rani? Why?

878
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:33,991
- No.
- Why, Rani? Why?

879
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:35,753
Why?

880
01:21:40,368 --> 01:21:41,630
Samson!

881
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:43,200
It was me.

882
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:45,771
They threatened to burn down
the house unless l...

883
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:47,430
She knew nothing.

884
01:21:47,608 --> 01:21:49,303
- Rani.
- Stop it.

885
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:55,315
No! Stop! Please!

886
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:05,157
No!

887
01:22:06,861 --> 01:22:08,385
Take him!

888
01:22:15,036 --> 01:22:16,264
Stop.

889
01:22:16,437 --> 01:22:17,904
- Come, Rani.
- Let me go.

890
01:22:18,306 --> 01:22:20,206
Seize him!

891
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:29,106
Go!

892
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:46,491
Come on.

893
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:22,628
Samson.

894
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:29,208
Samson!

895
01:25:04,904 --> 01:25:07,304
No. No, please.

896
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,206
See?

897
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:11,843
- See?
- Yes.

898
01:25:12,045 --> 01:25:15,503
You threatened the life of my father,
of my friend, of my wife.

899
01:25:24,357 --> 01:25:27,155
The garments are yours.
You won them. Pick them up.

900
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:30,261
I said, pick them up.

901
01:25:35,802 --> 01:25:37,099
Now go.

902
01:25:37,537 --> 01:25:39,562
Go back to Gaza.

903
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:42,733
Tell them Samson did this.

904
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:48,307
And tell them I have only begun.

905
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:52,715
I have only begun!

906
01:26:06,965 --> 01:26:09,957
- All of them?
- Yes, Majesty.

907
01:26:10,402 --> 01:26:13,371
His strength is not human.

908
01:26:13,539 --> 01:26:16,702
- Not human?
- The fields. The fields are on fire.

909
01:27:16,235 --> 01:27:18,100
No. No!

910
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:29,504
No! Rani!

911
01:27:29,681 --> 01:27:31,148
No! No!

912
01:27:32,417 --> 01:27:34,408
No! No!

913
01:27:42,227 --> 01:27:44,024
Execute them.

914
01:27:44,196 --> 01:27:46,027
Burn their fields.

915
01:27:46,832 --> 01:27:48,299
No!

916
01:27:50,602 --> 01:27:54,231
Here. Make it here.
It belongs to your enemy.

917
01:27:54,706 --> 01:27:57,800
My love, who I betrayed.

918
01:27:58,043 --> 01:27:59,533
Rani!

919
01:28:00,879 --> 01:28:03,040
Rani. Rani.

920
01:28:03,215 --> 01:28:04,876
Oh, no.

921
01:29:51,283 --> 01:29:54,946
General Tariq should be ordered
to burn down every Israelite village.

922
01:29:55,153 --> 01:29:59,180
Every village that makes payment
to our treasury? This isn't war.

923
01:29:59,724 --> 01:30:02,056
Samson doesn't lead an army.

924
01:30:02,227 --> 01:30:04,354
Not even his own people.

925
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:07,494
- He fights us alone.
- He must be stopped.

926
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:09,793
The dignity of your throne
is at stake here.

927
01:30:09,968 --> 01:30:12,766
Do not mistake my throne
for your pride.

928
01:30:13,672 --> 01:30:15,071
Consider this:

929
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,142
A farmer's field, Israelite or Philistine,
is more than just a crop.

930
01:30:19,577 --> 01:30:22,171
It's a life's work, a child's future.

931
01:30:23,081 --> 01:30:26,209
We will send an emissary
to these men of Judah.

932
01:30:26,584 --> 01:30:31,578
Giving us Samson is a small price to pay
for leaving their fields untouched.

933
01:30:31,756 --> 01:30:35,385
But he's one of them.
Why should they betray him?

934
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,721
It is a foolish man
who cannot be made afraid.

935
01:30:38,296 --> 01:30:41,459
And these men we treat with
are not foolish.

936
01:31:13,798 --> 01:31:15,060
Samson.

937
01:31:18,737 --> 01:31:20,034
Amrok?

938
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:25,073
They are dead.

939
01:31:25,844 --> 01:31:27,835
They're all dead.

940
01:31:34,518 --> 01:31:36,713
They came from Gaza.

941
01:31:38,822 --> 01:31:41,290
We were surrounded. Trapped.

942
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:44,390
There was no time to run.

943
01:31:46,196 --> 01:31:48,460
The laborers were killed.

944
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:52,368
They took your wife, beat her.
Father too.

945
01:31:53,604 --> 01:31:55,663
They left me for dead.

946
01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:01,534
There was nothing I could do, Samson.
Nothing.

947
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:05,937
I can still hear him laughing, their leader.
I mean, laughing and laughing.

948
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:07,845
Amrok, who?
Who was their leader?

949
01:32:11,422 --> 01:32:12,821
The laugh. The scar.

950
01:32:16,527 --> 01:32:18,825
His name is Mahal.

951
01:32:20,998 --> 01:32:23,728
Was it my fault, Samson? Was it?

952
01:32:24,668 --> 01:32:26,568
- No.
- I brought you in.

953
01:32:26,737 --> 01:32:28,295
I begged for the marriage.

954
01:32:28,505 --> 01:32:31,065
I loved her, Amrok.
The fault was not yours.

955
01:32:32,342 --> 01:32:35,004
The innocent are punished
for my sins.

956
01:32:46,123 --> 01:32:47,784
Come with me. I am going home.

957
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,892
- No.
- Amrok.

958
01:32:50,661 --> 01:32:52,219
Go, my brother.

959
01:32:53,464 --> 01:32:54,897
Go.

960
01:33:25,028 --> 01:33:28,828
<i>And so Samson returned</i>
<i>to the land of the Israelites. </i>

961
01:33:28,999 --> 01:33:31,559
<i>To a people confused</i>
<i>and angry with him... </i>

962
01:33:31,735 --> 01:33:34,533
<i>... for having stirred the wrath</i>
<i>of the Philistines. </i>

963
01:33:34,771 --> 01:33:37,365
<i>To a people no longer</i>
<i>seeking rebellion... </i>

964
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:40,135
<i>... but willing subjects</i>
<i>of the Philistines... </i>

965
01:33:40,344 --> 01:33:42,539
<i>... and of their own fears. </i>

966
01:33:57,928 --> 01:33:59,452
Let me pass.

967
01:34:11,742 --> 01:34:15,041
What is it? Have I done you harm?
Why are you doing this?

968
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:18,375
We will not lose our lives,
our homes, our crops...

969
01:34:18,582 --> 01:34:20,516
... at the altar of your anger.

970
01:34:20,684 --> 01:34:22,447
Then take me. Have done with it.

971
01:34:23,252 --> 01:34:27,655
You, you or you, come, take me.
Take hold of me. Bind me.

972
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:31,282
I have not changed.
You have changed.

973
01:34:31,827 --> 01:34:35,263
Yes, I want vengeance for the betrayals
that were done to me...

974
01:34:35,431 --> 01:34:36,898
... and I will have it.

975
01:34:37,066 --> 01:34:40,968
But you would betray me for fear
of what might happen to you.

976
01:34:43,839 --> 01:34:46,740
Once you asked me to lead you
into what I believed would be...

977
01:34:46,909 --> 01:34:49,639
... madness and slaughter.
Well, now I believe it more.

978
01:34:51,814 --> 01:34:53,509
But I will go.

979
01:34:53,983 --> 01:34:55,678
You'll hear no more of me.

980
01:34:57,553 --> 01:35:00,044
Out of my anger and my hate...

981
01:35:00,223 --> 01:35:02,748
... I'll try and find a peace with God.

982
01:35:09,298 --> 01:35:12,199
<i>Thus did Samson return to his home... </i>

983
01:35:12,368 --> 01:35:16,304
<i>... hiding in his heart the revenge</i>
<i>which one day he would wreak. </i>

984
01:35:16,472 --> 01:35:18,633
<i>And the hand of God</i>
<i>brought him back... </i>

985
01:35:18,808 --> 01:35:23,268
<i>... just as the life of his father, Manoah, </i>
<i>was drawing to a close. </i>

986
01:35:24,847 --> 01:35:26,439
My son.

987
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:28,880
I'm here, Father.

988
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:31,144
I have loved you...

989
01:35:31,954 --> 01:35:33,717
... since before.

990
01:35:33,889 --> 01:35:37,791
- I know, Father. I know.
- Since before and always.

991
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:40,492
It does not end.

992
01:35:41,597 --> 01:35:44,589
Give to your people...

993
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:46,725
... to God.

994
01:35:47,503 --> 01:35:48,936
Reach out.

995
01:35:50,206 --> 01:35:52,231
You have the gifts.

996
01:35:54,277 --> 01:35:55,471
Share them.

997
01:35:56,178 --> 01:35:57,873
It is your destiny.

998
01:36:00,182 --> 01:36:02,047
It does not end.

999
01:36:02,218 --> 01:36:04,584
Remember. It...

1000
01:36:16,032 --> 01:36:17,829
He is dead.

1001
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,287
<i>Even at the death of his father, </i>
<i>Samson did not weep. </i>

1002
01:37:23,465 --> 01:37:28,869
<i>Though in time, his tears would be</i>
<i>shed for all the people of Israel. </i>

1003
01:37:34,843 --> 01:37:38,472
<i>In the days that followed, </i>
<i>Samson set aside his revenge... </i>

1004
01:37:38,646 --> 01:37:41,240
<i>... and worked only for the good</i>
<i>of the Israelites. </i>

1005
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:46,009
<i>And he became a judge of his people. </i>
<i>Wise, good, helpful. </i>

1006
01:37:46,187 --> 01:37:49,850
<i>In every way the son his father</i>
<i>had wished and prayed for. </i>

1007
01:37:50,024 --> 01:37:51,992
You'll stay with us?

1008
01:37:55,563 --> 01:37:58,191
My father, as he died, said...

1009
01:37:59,067 --> 01:38:01,297
... if I stay with my people...

1010
01:38:01,469 --> 01:38:04,233
... the Philistines will not attack us.

1011
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,073
They threaten to burn the crops.

1012
01:38:07,242 --> 01:38:10,143
And cut off their own supplies?
No, empty threats.

1013
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:14,742
Would they rally our people
against them, provoke war?

1014
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:16,383
No.

1015
01:38:19,154 --> 01:38:20,815
I am here now.

1016
01:38:22,757 --> 01:38:25,521
Until the wheel turns again...

1017
01:38:25,693 --> 01:38:27,490
... I have come home.

1018
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:31,559
What is strength?

1019
01:38:40,275 --> 01:38:43,142
A stone, which nature formed,
is now just dust.

1020
01:38:44,112 --> 01:38:45,545
Yet what has changed?

1021
01:38:46,548 --> 01:38:49,915
The greater strength is to do
as God asks of you.

1022
01:38:50,652 --> 01:38:52,984
Faith, that is real strength.

1023
01:38:53,755 --> 01:38:58,658
To bend your will to God's,
that takes courage, that takes strength.

1024
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:05,222
My son has many friends and admirers.

1025
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,233
I wish I could count myself
among them.

1026
01:39:09,204 --> 01:39:11,399
When you forbade him
to capture Samson...

1027
01:39:11,606 --> 01:39:14,439
... you took from him the prize
with which he hoped to win you.

1028
01:39:14,609 --> 01:39:18,568
Samson has not gone. He's stepped back,
the better to leap forward.

1029
01:39:18,813 --> 01:39:21,976
They say he teaches.
They say he's plowing the fields.

1030
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:24,209
And I say he's not gone away.

1031
01:39:25,186 --> 01:39:28,349
My son prepares. He's right.

1032
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:31,122
Perhaps I should admire him for that.

1033
01:39:33,895 --> 01:39:37,490
All God asks of us
is that we do his will.

1034
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,733
For more than half my life,
I did not hear him.

1035
01:39:42,904 --> 01:39:46,340
Until I began to realize
that his voice...

1036
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:49,738
... speaks to the heart of man
as well as the mind.

1037
01:39:50,378 --> 01:39:52,209
His generosity and love...

1038
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,848
... may sometimes seem difficult
to understand...

1039
01:39:55,016 --> 01:39:57,075
... but it is always present.

1040
01:40:43,697 --> 01:40:46,359
<i>Samson led his people as a judge... </i>

1041
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:47,964
<i>... yet in his heart... </i>

1042
01:40:48,135 --> 01:40:52,435
<i>... the dark desires of man still sought</i>
<i>to hold sway over him. </i>

1043
01:40:52,606 --> 01:40:54,369
<i>The desires of the flesh... </i>

1044
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:57,806
<i>... and the flame of revenge</i>
<i>had not been quenched. </i>

1045
01:40:57,978 --> 01:40:59,775
<i>During all the time of peace... </i>

1046
01:40:59,947 --> 01:41:03,405
<i>... when he stayed with his people, </i>
<i>two flames burned low in him... </i>

1047
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:05,518
<i>... but were never extinguished:</i>

1048
01:41:05,786 --> 01:41:09,654
<i>The flame of lust</i>
<i>and the fire of revenge. </i>

1049
01:41:49,529 --> 01:41:52,123
Please think again.
There must be something I can do...

1050
01:41:52,299 --> 01:41:54,859
... to help you change your mind.
- No, I'm certain, Ira.

1051
01:41:55,068 --> 01:41:56,865
My mind is made up.

1052
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,972
When a man is thirsty,
so must he drink.

1053
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:04,309
My need is as strong as thirst.

1054
01:42:04,811 --> 01:42:09,077
But God has bound you to himself.
You cannot leave him now.

1055
01:42:09,249 --> 01:42:13,345
I do not leave him. I ask him only
to come with me for a while.

1056
01:42:13,687 --> 01:42:15,655
- No.
- Yes.

1057
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:17,753
I've decided.

1058
01:42:18,358 --> 01:42:22,226
- God decides.
- I decide.

1059
01:42:23,664 --> 01:42:26,155
Then you have abandoned him already.

1060
01:42:52,759 --> 01:42:54,590
Please...

1061
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:56,922
... stay.
- I cannot.

1062
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:59,098
I fear for you.

1063
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:04,295
You, my only child, whom
I've prayed for every hour of my life.

1064
01:43:05,538 --> 01:43:07,062
Mother...

1065
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:12,604
... I am leaving, but will always
be with you in my heart.

1066
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:19,410
Then may the Lord protect you.

1067
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:22,681
Goodbye, my son.

1068
01:43:23,723 --> 01:43:26,021
Go. Quickly.

1069
01:43:35,701 --> 01:43:37,134
Samson.

1070
01:43:37,737 --> 01:43:39,762
Samson, where are you going?

1071
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:41,632
Where are you going?

1072
01:43:41,807 --> 01:43:44,503
- To Gaza.
- Gaza? But you can't.

1073
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:47,805
- I must. I have an appointment there.
- No, Samson.

1074
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:52,474
She's gone. It's over. Put revenge
behind you. It is finished.

1075
01:43:52,651 --> 01:43:56,246
- It is never finished.
- They will kill you.

1076
01:43:58,457 --> 01:44:00,789
If that is my destiny...

1077
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,757
... then so be it.

1078
01:44:10,469 --> 01:44:12,232
Come back.

1079
01:44:14,073 --> 01:44:16,041
Come back to us.

1080
01:49:54,978 --> 01:49:56,411
Out of my way.

1081
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:13,455
You should have heard them
screaming.

1082
01:50:14,598 --> 01:50:16,566
Scream, Philistine.

1083
01:50:21,571 --> 01:50:23,334
For all eternity.

1084
01:51:00,744 --> 01:51:04,942
I am the instrument of the Lord!

1085
01:51:23,166 --> 01:51:24,656
General Tariq.

1086
01:51:24,868 --> 01:51:26,836
General Tariq. General Tariq.

1087
01:51:27,003 --> 01:51:28,300
- On your feet, boy.
- Samson.

1088
01:51:28,505 --> 01:51:30,473
- Samson, he's...
- Now take a deep breath.

1089
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,801
- You tell me like a soldier.
- Samson.

1090
01:51:32,976 --> 01:51:36,537
He's been here.
He's murdered a soldier, Mahal.

1091
01:51:36,713 --> 01:51:38,510
The officer with the scar.

1092
01:51:39,482 --> 01:51:42,644
- Has he been apprehended?
- No, he escaped. The city gates...

1093
01:51:42,818 --> 01:51:47,221
- They were still open? By all the gods...
- No. They were closed and barred.

1094
01:51:47,389 --> 01:51:48,981
- But they...
- Well, out with it, boy.

1095
01:51:49,158 --> 01:51:51,649
- Well, the city gates, they...
- Yes, yes.

1096
01:51:51,827 --> 01:51:54,955
They are torn off. They're gone.

1097
01:52:06,175 --> 01:52:10,669
Firstly, cut out the tongue of anyone
spreading this story beyond the city limits.

1098
01:52:10,846 --> 01:52:13,314
I don't want them laughing at us
all the way to Ramah.

1099
01:52:13,482 --> 01:52:16,076
Then we send our whole army
into Israelite territories...

1100
01:52:16,252 --> 01:52:19,483
... not just the borderlands.
We should burn them all, Father.

1101
01:52:19,655 --> 01:52:21,145
Commander.

1102
01:52:21,824 --> 01:52:25,590
Withdraw the whole army
from Israelite territories.

1103
01:52:25,761 --> 01:52:28,229
And the borderlands too.

1104
01:52:28,497 --> 01:52:31,796
- Order it back here to Gaza.
- Father.

1105
01:52:32,268 --> 01:52:33,599
Continue, commander.

1106
01:52:34,169 --> 01:52:37,798
If we attack, the Israelites
will simply disperse.

1107
01:52:38,073 --> 01:52:41,167
Let them form an army, attack us.

1108
01:52:41,877 --> 01:52:45,608
I will meet them in the field
and I will destroy them all...

1109
01:52:45,781 --> 01:52:48,215
... in open battle.
- And Samson?

1110
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:51,410
He must not be allowed
to lead a rebel army.

1111
01:52:51,587 --> 01:52:53,987
Without him, we will defeat them.

1112
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:56,551
With him at their head...

1113
01:52:57,393 --> 01:53:00,419
We must find a way to prevent that.

1114
01:53:48,344 --> 01:53:51,609
They say their god gives him
his strength.

1115
01:53:53,615 --> 01:53:56,982
I'm just a simple soldier, Majesty,
not a priest.

1116
01:53:57,152 --> 01:54:00,212
Your plan hardly indicates
a military cast of mind.

1117
01:54:00,389 --> 01:54:02,357
A soldier can only deal
with what he knows.

1118
01:54:02,524 --> 01:54:06,756
And what we know of Samson
is he prefers our women to his own.

1119
01:54:06,929 --> 01:54:09,659
The allure of strange flesh...

1120
01:54:09,865 --> 01:54:12,663
... is strong within him.
- This scheme is preposterous.

1121
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:16,997
What certainty do you have that
this Samson will take the bait you offer?

1122
01:54:17,172 --> 01:54:20,835
- Wouldn't you, if she was offered to you?
- What are we, panderers?

1123
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:24,501
This is no way to neutralize an enemy.

1124
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:29,140
There is no general on this earth could
devise a better plan to lay his enemy low...

1125
01:54:29,318 --> 01:54:33,049
... than to capture him by that part
of his body in which he is the weakest.

1126
01:54:38,326 --> 01:54:40,191
The fish will take the bait.

1127
01:54:40,661 --> 01:54:42,561
But will the bait agree to the fish?

1128
01:54:47,902 --> 01:54:50,598
In fishing, there's only one certainty:

1129
01:54:50,772 --> 01:54:52,967
You can never be sure of your catch.

1130
01:54:53,574 --> 01:54:56,543
There's always the danger that the fish
may escape with the bait.

1131
01:54:57,211 --> 01:54:59,145
Is that not so, general?

1132
01:55:01,282 --> 01:55:03,045
Very well, agreed.

1133
01:55:03,284 --> 01:55:04,546
Delilah?

1134
01:55:04,852 --> 01:55:06,843
I'll be proud to serve my people.

1135
01:55:07,388 --> 01:55:10,619
- In return for a financial consideration.
- Yes.

1136
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:13,590
Your loyalty to the throne
is measured in silver.

1137
01:55:13,861 --> 01:55:15,886
I'm offended, but not surprised.

1138
01:55:16,564 --> 01:55:17,929
How much?

1139
01:55:18,366 --> 01:55:21,130
Eleven hundred pieces of silver...

1140
01:55:21,302 --> 01:55:23,964
... from everyone in this chamber.

1141
01:55:24,205 --> 01:55:25,433
Agreed.

1142
01:55:26,007 --> 01:55:28,271
Let us proceed with all haste.

1143
01:55:31,546 --> 01:55:35,414
Promise me, general, never to devise
a scheme that puts me in that one's bed.

1144
01:55:35,583 --> 01:55:37,642
Careful, madam. You speak treason.

1145
01:55:37,819 --> 01:55:40,151
No. I speak as a woman.

1146
01:55:40,321 --> 01:55:42,789
A woman now of independent means.

1147
01:55:42,957 --> 01:55:45,289
Well, a girl must look to her future.

1148
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:49,089
A future wealthy enough to escape
when the old king dies?

1149
01:55:49,263 --> 01:55:52,755
- Exactly.
- And Samson?

1150
01:55:53,501 --> 01:55:57,028
Would it be treason to tell you
I'm excited by the prospect...

1151
01:55:57,205 --> 01:55:59,002
... as a woman?

1152
01:55:59,173 --> 01:56:01,664
Would it be treason to tell you...

1153
01:56:01,843 --> 01:56:05,244
... I'm excited by your excitement,
as a man?

1154
01:56:08,449 --> 01:56:09,711
Tell me...

1155
01:56:09,884 --> 01:56:15,117
... have you ever wondered what it would
be like, you and me, together?

1156
01:56:15,523 --> 01:56:17,252
Several times.

1157
01:56:18,326 --> 01:56:22,786
I mean, several times each day...

1158
01:56:23,831 --> 01:56:25,799
... and each night.

1159
01:56:27,134 --> 01:56:30,365
Let's hope Samson
provides the same service.

1160
01:56:36,410 --> 01:56:38,640
Come home to us, Samson.

1161
01:56:38,813 --> 01:56:40,804
Have you not quenched
the fires within you?

1162
01:56:40,982 --> 01:56:43,075
Soon now. Soon I will come home.

1163
01:56:43,251 --> 01:56:46,948
Revenge is not the only cold dish
on which I have supped.

1164
01:56:47,121 --> 01:56:49,453
So tell me news of our people.

1165
01:56:49,991 --> 01:56:51,925
They plan rebellion.

1166
01:56:54,462 --> 01:56:57,829
- Who does?
- Jehiel. Amram.

1167
01:56:58,132 --> 01:57:00,828
Since you left, the only way
they can advance themselves...

1168
01:57:01,002 --> 01:57:04,369
... is to lead our men into war.
- They should be stopped.

1169
01:57:04,805 --> 01:57:07,069
- Naomi supports them in this?
- Surely.

1170
01:57:10,177 --> 01:57:12,372
And what of my mother?

1171
01:57:12,547 --> 01:57:14,447
Age is her only enemy now.

1172
01:57:15,216 --> 01:57:17,343
Age is no enemy.

1173
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:19,780
It brings a courage and a wisdom
like no other.

1174
01:57:19,954 --> 01:57:21,512
The courage to face God.

1175
01:57:21,689 --> 01:57:24,658
Samson, nothing will stop them
taking arms.

1176
01:57:24,825 --> 01:57:26,315
Not even you.

1177
01:57:26,494 --> 01:57:28,654
But if you would come back now...

1178
01:57:29,496 --> 01:57:31,964
... lead them, then maybe...
- No, my friend.

1179
01:57:32,365 --> 01:57:33,593
No.

1180
01:57:37,203 --> 01:57:40,536
Rebellion will make martyrs,
but will not bring victory.

1181
01:57:40,707 --> 01:57:41,935
A generation will die...

1182
01:57:42,108 --> 01:57:45,544
... on Philistine swords.
- Lf you are not there to lead them.

1183
01:57:45,779 --> 01:57:48,475
The Lord God of Israel
calls you, Samson.

1184
01:57:48,648 --> 01:57:51,879
- Why do you not hear him?
- He gave me my strength.

1185
01:57:52,052 --> 01:57:55,146
- He gave me water when I was thirsty.
- Well, surely that's enough...

1186
01:57:55,322 --> 01:57:58,348
But he has never told me how
to destroy the Philistines.

1187
01:57:58,525 --> 01:58:01,892
He has never told me to join
in this march to certain death.

1188
01:58:02,195 --> 01:58:05,221
It's hard to hear someone's voice...

1189
01:58:06,666 --> 01:58:09,191
... when your back is turned to him.

1190
01:58:11,171 --> 01:58:13,935
If I came back,
it would be to stop them.

1191
01:58:14,474 --> 01:58:16,965
I could prevent them,
show them their foolishness.

1192
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:19,535
Then do it, Samson.

1193
01:58:19,946 --> 01:58:22,005
Save them from themselves.

1194
01:58:22,215 --> 01:58:24,046
I beg you.

1195
01:58:26,486 --> 01:58:28,920
<i>But though I begged, </i>
<i>he did not hear me. </i>

1196
01:58:29,089 --> 01:58:33,150
<i>A voice greater than mine</i>
<i>drew him towards his destiny. </i>

1197
01:59:16,770 --> 01:59:19,330
They said there were fish
in the river.

1198
01:59:22,842 --> 01:59:25,208
But not one that walks.

1199
01:59:26,946 --> 01:59:28,607
Samson.

1200
01:59:30,517 --> 01:59:34,180
- Who are you?
- Who would you like me to be?

1201
01:59:55,075 --> 01:59:56,736
Samson.

1202
01:59:57,877 --> 02:00:00,675
That means "the son of the sun, "
doesn't it?

1203
02:00:00,847 --> 02:00:02,178
Yes.

1204
02:00:04,951 --> 02:00:06,179
I prefer the dark.

1205
02:00:08,788 --> 02:00:11,120
Looking up at the stars...

1206
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:13,691
... where everything is written.

1207
02:00:15,028 --> 02:00:17,019
Perhaps you don't believe in that.

1208
02:00:19,466 --> 02:00:22,434
At this moment, here, now...

1209
02:00:23,035 --> 02:00:25,833
... I believe in the woman beside me.

1210
02:00:27,539 --> 02:00:30,303
You and I are supposed to be enemies.

1211
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:34,170
But I don't see that
written in the stars.

1212
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:37,071
So therefore it cannot be so.

1213
02:00:43,655 --> 02:00:46,385
You are cousin to the king?

1214
02:00:46,558 --> 02:00:48,321
So they say.

1215
02:00:49,561 --> 02:00:51,119
And you?

1216
02:00:52,598 --> 02:00:55,658
- You are the chosen of your god.
- So they say.

1217
02:01:00,272 --> 02:01:02,069
Chosen for what?

1218
02:01:04,276 --> 02:01:06,073
To lead your people?

1219
02:01:07,613 --> 02:01:10,582
To lead them away
from foolishness, perhaps.

1220
02:01:11,383 --> 02:01:13,544
And why do you not do so?

1221
02:01:16,054 --> 02:01:18,079
Because I choose you.

1222
02:01:24,363 --> 02:01:27,958
- Are you tired?
- No.

1223
02:01:29,468 --> 02:01:30,958
Good.

1224
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:25,884
Do you want to sleep?

1225
02:02:26,058 --> 02:02:28,026
No, do you?

1226
02:02:28,327 --> 02:02:29,692
No.

1227
02:02:36,435 --> 02:02:37,868
Chosen one.

1228
02:02:46,278 --> 02:02:48,303
I chose you too.

1229
02:03:43,601 --> 02:03:44,898
This is beautiful.

1230
02:03:45,102 --> 02:03:49,402
You see, we're also a simple people.
We love our childish games.

1231
02:03:51,575 --> 02:03:53,202
We have lives and loves.

1232
02:03:54,445 --> 02:03:57,141
We laugh and play.

1233
02:04:16,033 --> 02:04:17,261
Wait here.

1234
02:05:17,895 --> 02:05:20,295
Where does your strength
come from, Samson?

1235
02:05:20,464 --> 02:05:23,262
Like all strength,
it comes from within.

1236
02:05:23,434 --> 02:05:26,096
What could one do
to make you powerless in their arms?

1237
02:05:26,404 --> 02:05:29,999
- To make me weak like other men?
- Yes. What?

1238
02:05:30,174 --> 02:05:32,438
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

1239
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:34,305
Oh, I love secrets.

1240
02:05:36,847 --> 02:05:38,872
Why would I give up my strength?

1241
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:42,076
- It's all I have.
- Except for me.

1242
02:05:44,822 --> 02:05:47,916
I want you powerless
in my arms.

1243
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:51,760
- You'd tell no one?
- Who would I tell?

1244
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:06,532
All right, if I were tied
with seven new bowstrings...

1245
02:06:06,743 --> 02:06:09,303
... I would lose all my strength.

1246
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:11,877
Seven new bowstrings?

1247
02:06:12,048 --> 02:06:17,008
<i>And thus did Delilah begin to seek</i>
<i>for the secret of his very soul. </i>

1248
02:06:17,187 --> 02:06:20,816
<i>And as the Philistines waited for him</i>
<i>to be delivered to them... </i>

1249
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:23,788
<i>... there was a man among them</i>
<i>who doubted, perhaps... </i>

1250
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:26,622
<i>... the wisdom of his own plan. </i>

1251
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:32,767
Seven new bowstrings.

1252
02:06:38,007 --> 02:06:39,907
Tell me.

1253
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:52,115
<i>In the innocence of his love... </i>

1254
02:06:52,288 --> 02:06:55,621
<i>... beguiled, lost in Delilah</i>
<i>and in their lovers ' games... </i>

1255
02:06:55,792 --> 02:06:57,589
<i>... Samson did not see danger. </i>

1256
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,694
Samson. Samson, the soldiers.

1257
02:06:59,863 --> 02:07:02,627
<i>The first test, </i>
<i>he kept his pact with God. </i>

1258
02:07:02,799 --> 02:07:04,790
- Why do men always lie?
- What?

1259
02:07:28,658 --> 02:07:31,786
Samson. Samson, soldiers.

1260
02:07:31,961 --> 02:07:33,292
Soldiers, Samson.

1261
02:07:38,201 --> 02:07:40,260
You do not love me, Samson.

1262
02:07:41,604 --> 02:07:42,935
Yes.

1263
02:07:44,574 --> 02:07:46,201
More than reason itself.

1264
02:07:46,376 --> 02:07:49,470
<i>And did Delilah herself</i>
<i>begin to doubt?</i>

1265
02:07:49,712 --> 02:07:54,581
<i>Was the sign of his faith also the sign</i>
<i>of her true love for him?</i>

1266
02:07:56,152 --> 02:08:00,521
<i>For nine days and nine nights</i>
<i>they were as one. </i>

1267
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:03,158
<i>Samson fell beneath her spell. </i>

1268
02:08:03,326 --> 02:08:07,888
<i>It was beyond lust. He loved her truly, </i>
<i>as a man loves a woman. </i>

1269
02:08:08,131 --> 02:08:09,598
<i>Her flesh, yes... </i>

1270
02:08:09,799 --> 02:08:13,758
<i>... but her heart, her soul, </i>
<i>her every breath. </i>

1271
02:08:17,173 --> 02:08:21,405
<i>And blinded by that love, </i>
<i>he forgot his mission. </i>

1272
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,785
<i>Tell me. </i>

1273
02:08:40,063 --> 02:08:41,758
<i>You know already. </i>

1274
02:08:47,437 --> 02:08:48,836
<i>Tell me. </i>

1275
02:08:49,005 --> 02:08:52,702
<i>Bind me with your arms and love. </i>

1276
02:09:14,763 --> 02:09:17,630
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1277
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:20,227
Delilah, tell me.

1278
02:09:21,403 --> 02:09:24,531
What do you think?
You keep lying to me.

1279
02:09:27,009 --> 02:09:29,102
They're games. They're not lies.

1280
02:09:30,679 --> 02:09:32,408
So why not the truth?

1281
02:09:35,851 --> 02:09:38,649
Because you are not of my people.

1282
02:09:39,955 --> 02:09:42,423
And I've never told anyone.

1283
02:09:42,591 --> 02:09:44,855
I'm not of your people?

1284
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:50,155
I am you.

1285
02:09:50,332 --> 02:09:52,300
We're one.

1286
02:09:52,467 --> 02:09:54,492
The rest is nothing.

1287
02:09:56,605 --> 02:09:58,835
Even my own have betrayed me.

1288
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:02,768
And you think I will too?

1289
02:10:06,648 --> 02:10:10,379
I, who've given you my life,
am giving you my life.

1290
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,881
Do you doubt my love?

1291
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:18,492
No.

1292
02:10:20,062 --> 02:10:22,530
- Do you doubt me?
- No.

1293
02:10:26,468 --> 02:10:28,368
Of course you do.

1294
02:10:32,708 --> 02:10:35,370
I cannot give up my only gift.

1295
02:10:35,544 --> 02:10:37,478
Your gift?

1296
02:10:37,646 --> 02:10:40,547
Do you think I really
want you weakened?

1297
02:10:40,716 --> 02:10:42,308
Powerless?

1298
02:10:42,484 --> 02:10:44,611
I love you...

1299
02:10:45,153 --> 02:10:47,644
... the man that you are.

1300
02:10:47,823 --> 02:10:50,314
Why would I want to change you?

1301
02:10:53,795 --> 02:10:55,262
These...

1302
02:10:56,465 --> 02:10:59,263
These are games we've been playing.

1303
02:11:00,168 --> 02:11:03,433
If I told you the truth,
you could not test me.

1304
02:11:06,975 --> 02:11:10,968
- I would not.
- To test me is to destroy me.

1305
02:11:12,114 --> 02:11:15,709
- I understand.
- You could not.

1306
02:11:15,884 --> 02:11:18,318
No games with the truth.

1307
02:11:20,188 --> 02:11:23,214
None then. None ever.

1308
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,498
You're so beautiful.

1309
02:11:36,905 --> 02:11:38,600
No more tests.

1310
02:11:39,941 --> 02:11:41,499
Just love.

1311
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:44,039
The proof of love.

1312
02:11:46,014 --> 02:11:47,982
I cannot be betrayed in this.

1313
02:11:51,319 --> 02:11:53,445
I give you my word.

1314
02:11:57,425 --> 02:11:59,689
We are as one.

1315
02:12:00,027 --> 02:12:01,824
As one.

1316
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:36,988
Why have you been crying,
my only love? Have you not slept?

1317
02:13:37,157 --> 02:13:40,354
- I've been watching over you.
- And you were sad?

1318
02:13:43,097 --> 02:13:44,758
My heart...

1319
02:13:44,932 --> 02:13:47,366
... is heavier than all the iron in our land.
- Why?

1320
02:13:52,473 --> 02:13:56,637
While you were sleeping, I held the power
of life or death in my hands.

1321
02:14:07,555 --> 02:14:10,183
The life or death of the man you love?

1322
02:14:14,128 --> 02:14:16,028
But you did not cut.

1323
02:14:17,932 --> 02:14:20,867
No. I did not.

1324
02:14:29,076 --> 02:14:31,203
- But now...
- Now?

1325
02:14:31,378 --> 02:14:33,107
Now I must.

1326
02:14:33,314 --> 02:14:34,804
Put that away.

1327
02:14:35,916 --> 02:14:39,477
When power is given,
how can it not be used?

1328
02:14:39,653 --> 02:14:42,383
Because love is stronger still.

1329
02:14:43,591 --> 02:14:45,023
Oh, yes.

1330
02:14:45,692 --> 02:14:47,319
Love.

1331
02:14:50,396 --> 02:14:52,057
Love.

1332
02:15:21,127 --> 02:15:22,719
Take him!

1333
02:15:27,333 --> 02:15:28,925
Remember me, Israelite?

1334
02:15:29,936 --> 02:15:33,099
Where is your strength now,
savior of Israel?

1335
02:15:33,272 --> 02:15:35,035
And where is your god?

1336
02:15:36,009 --> 02:15:37,271
Cut!

1337
02:15:40,113 --> 02:15:41,637
Bring him out!

1338
02:15:51,357 --> 02:15:53,052
Delilah!

1339
02:15:53,493 --> 02:15:55,324
- Delilah!
- No!

1340
02:15:57,597 --> 02:15:59,394
No!

1341
02:16:50,149 --> 02:16:51,878
My son.

1342
02:16:56,656 --> 02:16:58,283
My son.

1343
02:17:31,124 --> 02:17:32,887
Enjoy yourself, Israelite!

1344
02:18:00,152 --> 02:18:02,143
You have forsaken me?

1345
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:07,251
Look.

1346
02:18:10,228 --> 02:18:12,219
It is there.

1347
02:18:13,198 --> 02:18:15,257
The sign.

1348
02:18:21,173 --> 02:18:24,939
- Praise the Lord.
- Now we can begin.

1349
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:47,994
The time has come.

1350
02:18:48,667 --> 02:18:51,135
The time is now!

1351
02:18:51,770 --> 02:18:55,206
We shall no longer bow our heads!

1352
02:18:55,473 --> 02:18:59,466
We shall no longer bend our knees...

1353
02:18:59,678 --> 02:19:03,978
... to the Philistines
and their images of gods.

1354
02:19:05,684 --> 02:19:08,050
Our seeds shall multiply...

1355
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:10,916
... and flourish in freedom.

1356
02:19:12,557 --> 02:19:15,924
And we shall come to know...

1357
02:19:16,094 --> 02:19:18,494
... how they walked as free men.

1358
02:19:18,663 --> 02:19:21,029
Lord, forgive Samson.

1359
02:19:21,199 --> 02:19:24,760
Stay by his side.
Please stay by his side.

1360
02:19:28,974 --> 02:19:31,169
Do not abandon him now.

1361
02:19:31,343 --> 02:19:34,005
Please, Lord, help him.

1362
02:19:34,913 --> 02:19:36,278
Please.

1363
02:19:38,917 --> 02:19:41,943
Now it shall begin.

1364
02:19:43,355 --> 02:19:46,791
We shall take off the yoke...

1365
02:19:46,992 --> 02:19:49,187
... of the unclean!

1366
02:19:50,762 --> 02:19:52,389
No, I beg you.

1367
02:19:52,564 --> 02:19:54,225
I beg you, stop!

1368
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,696
- It is the will of God.
- No. No, it is the will of men.

1369
02:19:57,869 --> 02:19:59,427
Silence!

1370
02:19:59,604 --> 02:20:01,504
The Lord is with us!

1371
02:20:04,709 --> 02:20:08,304
We shall be cloaked in divine armor.

1372
02:20:09,381 --> 02:20:11,542
For Gaza!

1373
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,554
For Gaza!

1374
02:20:18,990 --> 02:20:20,719
For Gaza!

1375
02:21:17,781 --> 02:21:19,510
Where is he?

1376
02:21:19,683 --> 02:21:22,117
Disturbed from my sleep for that...

1377
02:21:22,419 --> 02:21:25,115
That piece of...
Move your feet.

1378
02:21:26,523 --> 02:21:29,014
You maggot-ridden vermins.

1379
02:21:32,763 --> 02:21:34,856
On your feet, Israelite.

1380
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:38,759
On your feet.

1381
02:21:39,169 --> 02:21:41,069
Up. Up!

1382
02:21:43,874 --> 02:21:45,171
Yes.

1383
02:21:45,342 --> 02:21:47,936
There's somebody to see you.

1384
02:21:48,112 --> 02:21:50,307
And if you know
what's good for you...

1385
02:21:50,481 --> 02:21:51,812
Move!

1386
02:21:51,982 --> 02:21:53,950
Behave yourself.

1387
02:21:54,118 --> 02:21:56,484
Up the steps. Come.

1388
02:22:00,090 --> 02:22:01,990
Sit him down.

1389
02:22:08,298 --> 02:22:10,061
Now lay him down.

1390
02:22:14,138 --> 02:22:15,901
Wait outside.

1391
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:20,943
Drink.

1392
02:22:31,688 --> 02:22:33,519
Who are you?

1393
02:22:33,957 --> 02:22:35,754
Your enemy.

1394
02:22:41,632 --> 02:22:43,429
Do not be afraid.

1395
02:22:49,239 --> 02:22:51,366
I cannot restore his sight.

1396
02:22:51,542 --> 02:22:53,635
- But you can ease the pain?
- Yes.

1397
02:22:53,811 --> 02:22:56,109
Then use all your skill.

1398
02:23:09,326 --> 02:23:12,022
Tell me about your god, Samson.

1399
02:23:14,498 --> 02:23:17,433
He is the one God, the true God.

1400
02:23:21,138 --> 02:23:24,402
- And he has brought you to this?
- Yes.

1401
02:23:25,141 --> 02:23:28,042
Then he is a harsh god.

1402
02:23:28,244 --> 02:23:30,644
I have been a great sinner.

1403
02:23:33,015 --> 02:23:35,210
You think he punishes you?

1404
02:23:35,718 --> 02:23:37,151
I know it.

1405
02:23:39,789 --> 02:23:41,984
Then how do you make amends?

1406
02:23:43,025 --> 02:23:46,256
I pray for the courage to repent.

1407
02:23:50,433 --> 02:23:52,492
I will speak to the jailer.

1408
02:23:54,337 --> 02:23:58,774
I will see to it that
you are treated better.

1409
02:24:01,711 --> 02:24:05,010
Will you speak to them
of the other prisoners also?

1410
02:24:05,181 --> 02:24:07,581
That I cannot do.

1411
02:24:08,851 --> 02:24:12,116
Then neither must you
speak to them of me.

1412
02:24:13,956 --> 02:24:15,981
You are stubborn.

1413
02:24:16,492 --> 02:24:18,585
And proud, yes.

1414
02:24:19,929 --> 02:24:21,920
But no longer vain.

1415
02:24:24,333 --> 02:24:26,426
Why did you come?

1416
02:24:27,336 --> 02:24:28,963
To see you.

1417
02:24:30,573 --> 02:24:31,938
To learn.

1418
02:24:38,881 --> 02:24:42,214
And to tell you that tomorrow...

1419
02:24:43,052 --> 02:24:47,216
... I will lead our army
against your Israelites...

1420
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:48,857
... and I will win.

1421
02:24:49,492 --> 02:24:51,983
I will surely win.

1422
02:24:52,161 --> 02:24:54,129
Yes, I know.

1423
02:24:54,597 --> 02:24:56,224
You know?

1424
02:24:56,866 --> 02:24:58,561
How do you know?

1425
02:24:58,935 --> 02:25:00,562
I see it...

1426
02:25:01,604 --> 02:25:04,334
... as I see into your heart.

1427
02:25:06,275 --> 02:25:08,835
I am the first general
of the Philistines...

1428
02:25:09,011 --> 02:25:12,879
... your enemy, Samson,
and I have no heart.

1429
02:25:13,115 --> 02:25:15,049
You are not my enemy.

1430
02:25:17,987 --> 02:25:20,512
At last I understand...

1431
02:25:22,558 --> 02:25:25,584
... how I have filled that role myself.

1432
02:25:53,756 --> 02:25:57,385
Thousands of them.
Cavalry, chariots.

1433
02:25:57,560 --> 02:26:00,028
Old Tariq's commanding them.

1434
02:26:00,196 --> 02:26:02,790
The Israelites are for it now.

1435
02:26:02,965 --> 02:26:05,126
They won't stand a chance.

1436
02:26:10,006 --> 02:26:11,997
You! Get away from there!

1437
02:26:12,408 --> 02:26:14,603
Get down! Get down!

1438
02:26:14,777 --> 02:26:17,802
Go on. Get away from there,
all of you. Get back!

1439
02:26:32,827 --> 02:26:34,590
The Philistines!

1440
02:26:34,796 --> 02:26:39,233
Strike fear, O God, in their hearts!

1441
02:26:40,402 --> 02:26:42,063
Scatter them!

1442
02:27:05,827 --> 02:27:07,920
What is this place?

1443
02:27:08,830 --> 02:27:10,661
We are above a valley.

1444
02:27:10,832 --> 02:27:13,232
At this end is our Philistine army...

1445
02:27:13,401 --> 02:27:16,029
... and at the other...
- The Israelites.

1446
02:27:16,204 --> 02:27:18,104
- Yes.
- With weapons of bronze...

1447
02:27:18,273 --> 02:27:21,765
... and foolish generals
and empty certainties.

1448
02:27:22,077 --> 02:27:26,980
A soldier of mine who spoke those words
would lose his head as a traitor.

1449
02:27:27,148 --> 02:27:28,877
The truth betrays no one.

1450
02:27:29,284 --> 02:27:31,684
Was this really necessary?

1451
02:27:33,722 --> 02:27:35,917
Does it not amuse you, general?

1452
02:27:36,091 --> 02:27:37,422
No.

1453
02:27:37,592 --> 02:27:39,856
I thought you were a man
of wit and humor.

1454
02:27:40,028 --> 02:27:42,223
I thought you were a prince
of dignity.

1455
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:48,768
The only pity is that he cannot see
his people meet their destiny with death.

1456
02:27:57,679 --> 02:28:01,274
The Israelites are coming forward now.
They advance.

1457
02:28:01,516 --> 02:28:04,417
In moments, our own army
will step out to meet them.

1458
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:07,085
Soon now.

1459
02:28:08,923 --> 02:28:11,551
- Soon.
- The Philistines hold their position?

1460
02:28:11,726 --> 02:28:13,455
Yes.

1461
02:28:17,932 --> 02:28:20,730
General Tariq,
give the order to attack.

1462
02:28:25,106 --> 02:28:26,664
Scatter them!

1463
02:28:28,510 --> 02:28:31,775
There. A signal has been fired. Now.

1464
02:28:40,188 --> 02:28:42,213
What? Tell me.

1465
02:28:42,957 --> 02:28:45,892
The Philistine foot soldiers
in the center...

1466
02:28:46,327 --> 02:28:48,295
... they are retreating.

1467
02:28:48,463 --> 02:28:50,954
- Retreating?
- General, forbid your men from retreating.

1468
02:28:51,132 --> 02:28:54,067
- They obey my orders.
- What kind of soldiers are they?

1469
02:28:54,235 --> 02:28:58,001
- Skilled in the tactics of war.
- They are pulling back.

1470
02:28:58,173 --> 02:28:59,572
No.

1471
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:03,304
No, they are leading
the Israelite lambs...

1472
02:29:03,478 --> 02:29:05,343
... to my slaughterhouse.

1473
02:29:07,782 --> 02:29:10,341
I hate an incompetent enemy.

1474
02:29:10,517 --> 02:29:12,212
They make me less.

1475
02:29:12,386 --> 02:29:13,876
Less?

1476
02:29:14,054 --> 02:29:15,817
They turn a general into a butcher.

1477
02:29:15,989 --> 02:29:18,321
- Charge!
- Charge!

1478
02:29:22,095 --> 02:29:24,757
Our foot soldiers
have stopped retreating.

1479
02:29:25,132 --> 02:29:27,828
The cavalry detachments
on each flank are advancing.

1480
02:29:28,402 --> 02:29:30,393
The bowmen are ready.

1481
02:29:33,006 --> 02:29:35,975
The trap is sprung.
They stumble into it.

1482
02:31:04,798 --> 02:31:06,129
Amram.

1483
02:31:11,572 --> 02:31:13,267
Tell him.

1484
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:15,465
Now the chariots swing round.

1485
02:31:16,410 --> 02:31:17,775
They ride them down.

1486
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:24,542
Their lines are broken.

1487
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:31,585
They are broken.

1488
02:31:46,073 --> 02:31:49,065
- Where are you going?
- The battle's over.

1489
02:31:49,409 --> 02:31:51,001
God, forgive my people.

1490
02:31:51,278 --> 02:31:53,940
- Don't you want to watch?
- No, Your Highness.

1491
02:31:54,114 --> 02:31:56,742
Like watching the ocean tide
come in...

1492
02:31:56,917 --> 02:31:59,477
... it is inevitable, but dull.

1493
02:31:59,686 --> 02:32:02,745
Magnificent, general.
This is your victory.

1494
02:32:02,922 --> 02:32:05,550
A tide is a tide, Your Highness...

1495
02:32:05,725 --> 02:32:08,558
... even when it's measured in blood.

1496
02:32:19,171 --> 02:32:20,866
Samson.

1497
02:32:22,141 --> 02:32:24,871
- Samson.
- Jehiel? Jehiel.

1498
02:32:25,144 --> 02:32:27,476
Samson. No!

1499
02:32:31,450 --> 02:32:33,918
Bravely done, Your Highness.

1500
02:32:34,086 --> 02:32:35,917
Bravely done.

1501
02:33:24,770 --> 02:33:27,034
It pleases the people.

1502
02:33:27,206 --> 02:33:29,834
But did it please our gods?

1503
02:33:30,443 --> 02:33:33,173
It was a great victory, my old friend.

1504
02:33:33,479 --> 02:33:36,539
Yes, Majesty. A great victory.

1505
02:34:52,958 --> 02:34:54,220
Go on!

1506
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:56,950
Get up!

1507
02:35:16,381 --> 02:35:19,145
When his eyes were taken...

1508
02:35:19,417 --> 02:35:22,409
... your beauty was taken from him too.

1509
02:35:24,889 --> 02:35:28,347
Now you're the same to him
as any other woman.

1510
02:36:07,966 --> 02:36:10,059
<i>And thus, in his suffering... </i>

1511
02:36:10,235 --> 02:36:13,432
<i>... did the faith of Samson</i>
<i>begin to grow. </i>

1512
02:36:13,605 --> 02:36:16,005
<i>How could God's design be fulfilled... </i>

1513
02:36:16,174 --> 02:36:19,940
<i>... by a powerless blind man</i>
<i>chained to a wheel?</i>

1514
02:36:20,211 --> 02:36:23,112
<i>The mystery of God's plan</i>
<i>could be seen by no one. </i>

1515
02:36:23,281 --> 02:36:24,976
<i>Except, perhaps... </i>

1516
02:36:25,149 --> 02:36:28,482
<i>... the one man who could see</i>
<i>nothing else. </i>

1517
02:37:03,821 --> 02:37:06,346
<i>Even as the Philistines rejoiced... </i>

1518
02:37:06,524 --> 02:37:10,016
<i>... there was still one who knew</i>
<i>that the shadow of doubt... </i>

1519
02:37:10,194 --> 02:37:13,288
<i>... can darken man 's brightest day. </i>

1520
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:44,587
<i>In all of Gaza, </i>
<i>the one who had doubted... </i>

1521
02:37:44,762 --> 02:37:47,822
<i>... began to wonder if he too</i>
<i>was part of the instrument... </i>

1522
02:37:47,999 --> 02:37:50,762
<i>... of God's unknowable design. </i>

1523
02:38:19,763 --> 02:38:21,492
Quickly, now.

1524
02:38:27,170 --> 02:38:28,501
Quickly!

1525
02:38:33,176 --> 02:38:34,734
Go on.

1526
02:38:37,347 --> 02:38:38,871
Samson.

1527
02:38:40,584 --> 02:38:42,313
Yoram?

1528
02:38:44,287 --> 02:38:46,050
Yoram?

1529
02:38:47,424 --> 02:38:50,518
It's not much, but the lamb is good.

1530
02:38:52,963 --> 02:38:55,397
- How did you get... ?
- I found work here.

1531
02:38:55,565 --> 02:38:57,192
Drink.

1532
02:39:00,904 --> 02:39:02,804
God is good.

1533
02:39:18,755 --> 02:39:20,518
A beard.

1534
02:39:21,958 --> 02:39:25,257
You're a man, Yoram.
No longer the child I used to know.

1535
02:39:26,263 --> 02:39:29,699
And one day I'll be old. Drink. Eat.

1536
02:39:33,437 --> 02:39:36,600
- My mother?
- Living.

1537
02:39:38,075 --> 02:39:40,771
- And Naomi?
- Here, in Gaza.

1538
02:39:40,944 --> 02:39:42,275
She's here?

1539
02:39:43,246 --> 02:39:45,407
She's mad. The danger.

1540
02:39:48,185 --> 02:39:50,016
Ira is dead.

1541
02:39:51,021 --> 02:39:53,353
His sons, killed in the battle.

1542
02:39:54,291 --> 02:39:57,226
He lived a few weeks,
and died with God's name on his lips.

1543
02:39:57,594 --> 02:39:59,118
Ira.

1544
02:40:00,163 --> 02:40:03,257
He kept showing me the way,
and I kept looking elsewhere.

1545
02:40:03,433 --> 02:40:06,459
All right. Finish now. Come on.

1546
02:40:06,636 --> 02:40:08,763
- Eat and remember what he taught us:
- Up. Up.

1547
02:40:08,939 --> 02:40:11,806
God's hand writes straight
even when the lines are crooked.

1548
02:40:11,975 --> 02:40:15,274
Come on. Come on. Come on, up!

1549
02:40:28,291 --> 02:40:32,625
God is my strength. God is my strength.
God is my...

1550
02:40:38,635 --> 02:40:40,068
Your Highness?

1551
02:40:41,104 --> 02:40:43,765
- What do you want?
- Someone wishes to see you.

1552
02:40:44,306 --> 02:40:45,967
A woman.

1553
02:40:46,142 --> 02:40:47,973
An Israelite woman.

1554
02:40:49,845 --> 02:40:53,645
- How much did she bribe you?
- Your Highness.

1555
02:40:55,417 --> 02:40:56,884
Fetch her.

1556
02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:19,405
Leave us.

1557
02:41:28,984 --> 02:41:30,747
Who are you?

1558
02:41:31,287 --> 02:41:33,016
Just a woman.

1559
02:41:36,859 --> 02:41:38,759
Well...

1560
02:41:38,928 --> 02:41:40,759
... what do you want?

1561
02:41:41,931 --> 02:41:44,092
I want you to help me
to see someone.

1562
02:41:46,402 --> 02:41:48,427
You do, do you?

1563
02:41:52,474 --> 02:41:54,635
And who might that be?

1564
02:41:55,578 --> 02:41:57,307
Samson.

1565
02:42:00,749 --> 02:42:02,717
Just a woman.

1566
02:42:06,655 --> 02:42:10,250
This will be a feast to remember,
my faithful friends.

1567
02:42:10,426 --> 02:42:13,793
Majesty, to make the celebrations
complete, could you not order Samson...

1568
02:42:13,963 --> 02:42:16,796
... be brought down and displayed?
- You are cruel, Delilah.

1569
02:42:16,966 --> 02:42:20,527
The savior of Israel, Samson,
brought here in chains?

1570
02:42:21,637 --> 02:42:24,970
- What do you think, my old friend?
- Well, surely...

1571
02:42:25,774 --> 02:42:27,935
... if Delilah wishes, Majesty.

1572
02:42:28,711 --> 02:42:30,645
The weakness of beautiful women...

1573
02:42:30,813 --> 02:42:33,782
... is that they become soft
because men can deny them nothing.

1574
02:42:33,949 --> 02:42:37,544
Surely, Delilah, above all...

1575
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:39,779
... deserves to be rewarded.

1576
02:42:39,955 --> 02:42:41,786
Rewarded, yes.

1577
02:42:41,957 --> 02:42:44,425
And consoled, eh?

1578
02:42:44,693 --> 02:42:46,752
So it shall be.

1579
02:43:03,245 --> 02:43:07,045
God is my strength.
God is my strength.

1580
02:43:07,249 --> 02:43:09,240
God is my strength.

1581
02:43:28,304 --> 02:43:31,398
Why did you ask for Samson
to be brought here?

1582
02:43:32,041 --> 02:43:36,136
- To entertain his captors.
- Has he not suffered enough?

1583
02:43:38,446 --> 02:43:41,506
All the world's a wheel, commander.

1584
02:43:41,683 --> 02:43:44,379
- You taught me that once.
- I did?

1585
02:43:44,552 --> 02:43:46,383
And when was that?

1586
02:43:47,555 --> 02:43:50,422
Before I knew the pain of feeling.

1587
02:43:55,029 --> 02:43:57,930
You did not want him here
just for display.

1588
02:44:01,002 --> 02:44:02,469
No.

1589
02:44:03,371 --> 02:44:05,202
Then what?

1590
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:09,771
Because even though I sold him,
he's still mine.

1591
02:44:15,183 --> 02:44:16,741
Is he?

1592
02:44:44,779 --> 02:44:46,371
Samson.

1593
02:44:48,182 --> 02:44:50,514
I have sinned against him.

1594
02:44:51,352 --> 02:44:54,344
Every law, every commandment.

1595
02:44:55,156 --> 02:44:57,488
How can he forgive me?

1596
02:44:57,658 --> 02:45:00,092
The mercy of God is infinite.

1597
02:45:02,363 --> 02:45:04,695
And his punishment severe.

1598
02:45:18,646 --> 02:45:22,514
You've looked all your life, Samson,
for a sign.

1599
02:45:24,719 --> 02:45:27,916
And never knew that
the need to search...

1600
02:45:28,689 --> 02:45:31,317
... was itself the sign.

1601
02:45:34,028 --> 02:45:35,825
But now?

1602
02:45:37,565 --> 02:45:39,999
Now everything is dark.

1603
02:45:44,439 --> 02:45:46,930
And within the darkness...

1604
02:45:47,341 --> 02:45:49,241
... I see the Lord.

1605
02:45:52,013 --> 02:45:54,607
The only world I see now
belongs to God.

1606
02:45:56,050 --> 02:45:57,915
Oh, Samson.

1607
02:45:59,353 --> 02:46:00,718
Yes.

1608
02:46:01,255 --> 02:46:04,782
On your feet, Israelite. Boy, help him.

1609
02:46:12,834 --> 02:46:15,803
Out of the way there.
Come on. Get back.

1610
02:46:15,970 --> 02:46:20,270
Move. Move for the savior of Israel.

1611
02:46:21,976 --> 02:46:23,967
The savior of Israel.

1612
02:46:29,983 --> 02:46:31,951
The savior of Israel.

1613
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:50,568
- Are you his woman?
- I thought you were.

1614
02:46:51,571 --> 02:46:53,129
No.

1615
02:46:53,673 --> 02:46:56,301
I'm the woman he trusted.

1616
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:01,780
When he looked into my eyes,
I was the last he saw.

1617
02:47:01,948 --> 02:47:04,178
You hated him so much?

1618
02:47:06,953 --> 02:47:08,887
They paid me well.

1619
02:47:18,365 --> 02:47:20,526
You hated him so much?

1620
02:47:22,068 --> 02:47:23,968
He'd become too dangerous.

1621
02:47:25,639 --> 02:47:27,664
You hated him...

1622
02:47:28,041 --> 02:47:29,872
... so much.

1623
02:47:30,377 --> 02:47:34,245
No. I loved him too well.

1624
02:47:34,414 --> 02:47:36,678
Yet still you brought him down.

1625
02:47:39,786 --> 02:47:41,413
Yes.

1626
02:47:41,588 --> 02:47:43,453
That's enough.

1627
02:47:43,623 --> 02:47:45,557
This is not love.

1628
02:47:50,897 --> 02:47:52,728
And you?

1629
02:47:52,899 --> 02:47:54,799
Do you love him?

1630
02:47:55,602 --> 02:47:57,502
Since I first knew him.

1631
02:48:01,775 --> 02:48:04,335
And he loved you?

1632
02:48:11,585 --> 02:48:14,952
Come. I'll make a bargain with you.

1633
02:48:15,188 --> 02:48:18,180
Come. A very small bargain.

1634
02:48:27,734 --> 02:48:29,531
So everything is ready?

1635
02:48:29,703 --> 02:48:31,193
Good.

1636
02:48:36,176 --> 02:48:37,609
Yoram, where are we?

1637
02:48:37,777 --> 02:48:40,473
- Where are they taking me?
- To the pillars.

1638
02:48:52,826 --> 02:48:54,987
- Yoram.
- I'm here.

1639
02:48:55,462 --> 02:48:57,157
I'm here.

1640
02:48:58,298 --> 02:48:59,765
Now go.

1641
02:49:00,133 --> 02:49:01,998
Yoram, know that I have loved you.

1642
02:49:02,569 --> 02:49:04,730
- But I can stay.
- Go.

1643
02:49:04,904 --> 02:49:07,873
- Go quickly.
- Samson.

1644
02:49:08,375 --> 02:49:09,603
Go quickly.

1645
02:49:11,511 --> 02:49:13,308
Go to him.

1646
02:49:15,148 --> 02:49:16,843
Samson.

1647
02:49:19,519 --> 02:49:21,008
Samson.

1648
02:49:22,221 --> 02:49:23,415
Naomi?

1649
02:49:27,726 --> 02:49:29,591
Naomi?

1650
02:49:29,762 --> 02:49:31,195
Naomi.

1651
02:49:31,363 --> 02:49:32,990
Samson.

1652
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,959
- Take her with you, Yoram. Take her.
- No. Not yet.

1653
02:49:39,138 --> 02:49:42,505
Give us a few moments.
For all the years.

1654
02:49:43,342 --> 02:49:45,003
Yes.

1655
02:49:45,678 --> 02:49:47,339
A few moments.

1656
02:49:51,517 --> 02:49:55,647
And when I tell you to go, you will leave
at once, out of the temple, out of the city.

1657
02:49:55,821 --> 02:49:59,689
- Yes, yes. What is it, Samson?
- Do you swear, both of you?

1658
02:49:59,858 --> 02:50:02,622
- Yes. I swear.
- Yes, I swear.

1659
02:50:05,964 --> 02:50:07,932
Here I am.

1660
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:10,728
Beside me, where you've always been.

1661
02:50:12,738 --> 02:50:17,072
And now my body wears chains
that have always been around my heart.

1662
02:50:17,242 --> 02:50:19,836
And yet I see you as you are. Free.

1663
02:50:20,179 --> 02:50:22,875
It is they who are enslaved.

1664
02:50:23,215 --> 02:50:25,149
They will all die.

1665
02:50:25,984 --> 02:50:27,576
What?

1666
02:50:30,055 --> 02:50:31,852
All men must die.

1667
02:50:32,024 --> 02:50:34,390
Only the hour is unknown.

1668
02:50:37,196 --> 02:50:39,721
Will you kiss me farewell, Samson?

1669
02:50:39,898 --> 02:50:43,026
- Naomi, do not torture me.
- Please.

1670
02:50:43,402 --> 02:50:45,495
With the mark of your kiss...

1671
02:50:45,671 --> 02:50:48,105
... I will always be blessed.

1672
02:51:01,186 --> 02:51:04,451
Dry your tears, woman.

1673
02:51:07,793 --> 02:51:12,355
It has taken me a lifetime to understand
God is the God of forgiveness.

1674
02:51:20,172 --> 02:51:21,400
Now.

1675
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:23,831
Leave me now.

1676
02:51:24,309 --> 02:51:26,140
It is over.

1677
02:51:31,450 --> 02:51:32,815
Boy...

1678
02:51:33,352 --> 02:51:35,820
... I want you to do something for me.

1679
02:51:35,988 --> 02:51:39,424
Leave the temple.
Ride away from Gaza.

1680
02:51:39,591 --> 02:51:40,990
- General?
- Do as I say, boy.

1681
02:51:42,561 --> 02:51:43,823
Ride like the wind.

1682
02:51:43,996 --> 02:51:45,964
- Yes, commander.
- Hurry.

1683
02:51:46,131 --> 02:51:48,895
- In which direction, general?
- West.

1684
02:51:49,601 --> 02:51:51,865
- To the sea?
- Yes.

1685
02:51:52,037 --> 02:51:53,095
And then?

1686
02:51:58,577 --> 02:52:01,205
Submerge yourself in the water.

1687
02:52:02,915 --> 02:52:04,815
Then ride back.

1688
02:52:06,285 --> 02:52:07,616
Go.

1689
02:52:20,798 --> 02:52:23,323
Now, O God of Israel...

1690
02:52:24,001 --> 02:52:26,834
... grant me that for which I was born.

1691
02:52:30,341 --> 02:52:35,005
There is Samson,
hero of the mighty Israelites...

1692
02:52:35,179 --> 02:52:39,047
... come to worship at the altar
of our gods, whom you defied.

1693
02:52:40,051 --> 02:52:43,452
Grant me the strength again just once...

1694
02:52:43,621 --> 02:52:45,418
... O God.

1695
02:52:53,164 --> 02:52:57,032
Forgive Samson, God of Israel.

1696
02:53:02,673 --> 02:53:04,004
Kill him!

1697
02:53:04,542 --> 02:53:06,407
Kill him!

1698
02:53:10,915 --> 02:53:12,143
Kill him!

1699
02:53:35,072 --> 02:53:38,439
My son. My son. You knew.

1700
02:53:39,543 --> 02:53:41,204
You knew!

1701
02:54:35,800 --> 02:54:39,031
Forgive my son, O God of Israel.

1702
02:54:41,072 --> 02:54:43,905
With me die the Philistines.

1703
02:54:47,445 --> 02:54:48,776
Run for your life!

1704
02:54:52,950 --> 02:54:55,942
At last, O God of Israel!

1705
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:42,085
<i>And thus did Samson return</i>
<i>to the land of Israel. </i>

1706
02:56:42,325 --> 02:56:45,556
<i>Thus did my friend, </i>
<i>the son of Mara and Manoah... </i>

1707
02:56:45,728 --> 02:56:48,561
<i>... judge of his people, </i>
<i>return to his home... </i>

1708
02:56:48,765 --> 02:56:53,793
<i>... passing on the way the very well</i>
<i>where the stranger had foretold his birth. </i>

1709
02:56:54,003 --> 02:56:57,063
<i>The will of God had been fulfilled... </i>

1710
02:56:57,240 --> 02:56:59,674
<i>... and the faith which in his life</i>
<i>he had sought... </i>

1711
02:56:59,843 --> 02:57:03,040
<i>... was now finally and certainly found. </i>

1712
02:57:03,213 --> 02:57:06,671
<i>It was not the least</i>
<i>of his gifts to me. </i>

1713
02:57:06,850 --> 02:57:09,410
<i>To all things, there is a purpose. </i>

1714
02:57:09,586 --> 02:57:12,282
<i>It was through</i>
<i>the Philistine woman, Delilah... </i>

1715
02:57:12,455 --> 02:57:15,049
<i>... that Samson finally came</i>
<i>to the faith... </i>

1716
02:57:15,225 --> 02:57:19,719
<i>... which began the liberation</i>
<i>that the Lord God of Israel had promised. </i>

1717
02:57:19,896 --> 02:57:22,023
<i>He will not be forgotten. </i>
