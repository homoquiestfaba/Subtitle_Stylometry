1
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,317
No, please, Lucy, listen to me.

2
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,644
If you think that
I don't know that I have faults,
you're wrong.

3
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,496
I know them all.
I've made a list...

4
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,934
Please, Lucy.
What?

5
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:47,589
I'm a total fucker.
What?

6
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:49,939
I'm selfish. I only
think about myself.

7
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:54,117
Simon, no. Stop! Listen,
it's not your fault.

8
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,619
It really isn't. Hi!

9
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,443
No. We're grand. We were
finishing up, anyway.

10
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,299
So, right. I'll see
you around, Simon.

11
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,487
If you'll give me half an hour
or 40 minutes...

12
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:04,780
Listen, we're late already.
Aren't we?

13
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,476
Really late.
Bye.

14
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,890
I thought it was all off
since Tuesday.

15
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:10,194
It was. He asked
to see me again.

16
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,050
I don't know how you do it,
Luce.
What?

17
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,143
Look in there. He's crying.

18
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,102
My own sister
can make a grown man cry

19
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:22,581
in a Temple Bar coffee shop.

20
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:23,926
Well, I nearly cried, too.

21
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:26,288
Oh, you know
I'm not one for crying.

22
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,116
It doesn't mean
I don't feel things.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,652
Simon is a fool,
but he's kind of harmless,
and you just... ohh!

24
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,330
[laughter]

25
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,104
I mean, seriously, Lucy,
all these fellas,

26
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,557
well, the madness,
the release of...

27
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,775
Shut up.

28
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,494
A big spiritual, physical,
hopping-off-the-walls

29
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:47,824
in-a-mad-frenzy kind of thing.

30
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:50,522
Come on, Laura.
For all your talk,
what do you do?

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,351
You haven't bothered going out
with anyone since last year,

32
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,224
and the last one was that
ridiculous bearded guy
who drank...

33
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:01,186
Bernard.

34
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:05,949
It's all in your head.
You never do anything.

35
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:07,018
That's the difference.

36
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:08,496
Ah, well.

37
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:09,802
[both]Cheers.

38
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:11,675
[Lucy]
Is that OK for now?

39
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,784
[man]But how about a song?
Come on, give us a song.

40
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:15,808
Ah, if you like, yeah.

41
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,637
[playing piano]

42
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:19,683
They're begging me
to sing, Andy.

43
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,860
[applause]

44
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:25,689
Someday, he'll come along

45
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,040
The man I love...

46
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:31,216
He will.
I know he will.

47
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:36,090
And he'll be big and strong...

48
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,704
No, don't worry.
I'm not interested.

49
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:44,772
There's another.
Oh, maybe Laura was right.

50
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:48,103
I just can't make my mind up.
I mean, they're nice boys.

51
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,584
Well, most of them,

52
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:56,242
but, you know, sometimes
you just wish a new face
would pop up and...

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,599
Still, I'm gonna
Oh! We meet him one daythat.

54
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,690
Maybe Tuesday will be

55
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:13,650
My good news day...

56
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:16,262
Hands off, Maria.
I saw him first.

57
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:21,006
Home

58
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:24,662
From which we'll never roam

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,663
Who would?

60
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:26,881
Would you?

61
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:30,756
Is he really that shy,
I wonder. Hmm.

62
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,822
Well, I suppose
it's nice for a change.

63
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:40,287
For the man I love

64
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,120
[woman]
Good on you, Luce! e]

65
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:49,794
OK, here goes.

66
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:51,796
So, do you want to order,
or are you waiting for someone?

67
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Uh, sorry?

68
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,692
Are you ready to order?

69
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:56,651
Oh, yeah. I thought
you were a singer.

70
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,697
[laughs]
Well, it depends on
how you look at it.

71
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,096
I'm either a singer
who does a bit of waitressing

72
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
or a waitress
that does a bit of singing.

73
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:05,792
I don't know what I am myself.

74
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:07,402
You're a really good singer.

75
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:10,753
Yeah?

76
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,581
Thank you.

77
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:15,366
So, did you want to eat or not?

78
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:21,111
Oh, yeah.
Um... yes, please.

79
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,810
Corn-fed chicken's very good.

80
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,812
Oh. OK, fine.

81
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:29,380
OK. And wine?
What do you like,
red or white?

82
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:37,040
I recommend the house red,
but if you prefer white...

83
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:40,783
Corn-fed chicken.
House red.

84
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:44,308
Great. I like a man
who can make up his own mind.

85
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,099
Ha-ha! Gotcha..

86
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,929
Hi.
Hi! You're off.

87
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:57,714
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

88
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,369
Ohh...
it was fantastic.

89
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,069
Can't he see he only has to ask?

90
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,550
Come on.
How shy can you be?

91
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,726
Oh, for God's sake.

92
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,772
So, um... could I
see you again?

93
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,513
Meet you maybe?

94
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,822
Wow. Yeah, I'd love to.

95
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:20,931
I'm Lucy, by the way.

96
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:23,871
Hello, Lucy.
I'm, um...

97
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,482
[giggles]You can't
remember your own name?

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,140
Um, no. I'm-I'm Adam.

99
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,795
Will you call me?
Have you a pen?

100
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:36,536
Yeah.

101
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,845
I'm delighted you asked me.

102
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,325
I was, um...

103
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,956
I don't know.
It's weird.

104
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,808
I just felt something
was happening.

105
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:50,246
Something is, maybe.

106
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:58,819
OK. I'll phone you
soon, then...

107
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:00,909
Adam.

108
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,086
Bye.
Bye.

109
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,958
[phone ringing]

110
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,244
Lucy, are you
getting that?
Yeah.

111
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,920
Pick it up, so.

112
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,486
I will, yeah.

113
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,665
Well, go on.

114
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,929
Fair enough.
He'll ring off
if you don't.

115
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:21,451
Mum!

116
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,107
Hello?

117
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:25,672
Hello.

118
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:27,893
Oh, hi, hi.
So you got my message.

119
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,895
Yeah, I got them all.
It was brilliant.

120
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,463
Right. Well, see,
I wasn't sure if...

121
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,903
It's really hard talking
to those things, isn't it?

122
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:39,905
[giggling]

123
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:43,885
Lucy, shut up! You sound like
a horse on acid.

124
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,912
So, anyway, um...

125
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:50,394
Hello, are you still there?

126
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:51,872
Still here.

127
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,772
Oh, good, yeah. So,
let's meet up tomorrow.

128
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,830
I'll call round,
pick you up in the car.

129
00:06:58,968 --> 00:06:59,968
Is that bad?

130
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,884
No. Fine. Lovely.

131
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:05,671
So, call here half-seven, then.

132
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:09,042
Yeah. Yeah.
Cool. Yeah.

133
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,154
Yeah.

134
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,461
Put... the phone... down.

135
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,941
Bye!

136
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,335
That seemed to go all right.

137
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,685
Were you nervous?
Mum!

138
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,687
Only asking. You sounded
a wee bit nervous.

139
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,471
That's all.
That's not like you.

140
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,996
He's calling here
to collect me tomorrow.

141
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:27,519
He has a car.

142
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,010
Oh, that's lovely.

143
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,619
Mind? Of course I don't.
Little Jeanie.

144
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:46,408
I'll collect her
tomorrow, then.
Oh, a cake.

145
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:48,567
I didn't forget
somebody's birthday, did I?

146
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,329
How about mine
for the last 20 years?

147
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,370
Lucy's new fella's calling.
I got in a bit of cake.

148
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,046
Jesus, you go through them.
Fair cheers to you.

149
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,070
Right. We're going.

150
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,376
Ah, don't go yet.

151
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:00,894
Yes, go. I wish
you'd all just feck off.

152
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:04,025
But we live here, Luce.
We've nowhere to feck off to.

153
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,013
Now, the boy offered to come
and pick her up in his car.

154
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,734
On a first date! Imagine!

155
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,879
He's only giving her
bad habits, if you ask me.

156
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:14,324
We should make him welcome, huh?

157
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,240
Looks like we're going
to get to meet

158
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:17,664
this week's winning entry
after all.

159
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:21,965
Oh... forget it.
Forget it.

160
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,751
Hello. Oh, thank you!

161
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,034
Hope you don't think it's naff.

162
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:30,018
Oh, no. No way. Listen,
I hope you don't mind.

163
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,399
Some of my family are here...
all of them, actually...

164
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,676
and... well, would you mind
meeting them?

165
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,008
Only for a second, and then
we cSure. That'd be nice.way.

166
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:45,381
Would you like a bit of cake?

167
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,080
It's only a bought cake.
I haven't baked in years.

168
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,343
Alice, my eldest daughter
and her husband...

169
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,953
I'll be right back.

170
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,087
And this is my baby.
Both my babies.

171
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,785
Which one?
How you doing?

172
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:01,005
And, of course, poor Laura.

173
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,964
I admit it.
I was amazed.

174
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,509
He's nothing like
anyone you've ever
gone out with before.

175
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:06,968
Told you.
So what's the change?

176
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,447
I'm maturing.

177
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:10,319
Even his name, it's so not you.

178
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,888
It's so primal.
Adam.

179
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,020
Yeah, it's a crap name,
all right.

180
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,125
And he reads. He can quote
Christina Rossetti.

181
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:19,024
Oh. What'd he do that for?

182
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:22,027
It came up. She's not exactly
a household name as a poet,

183
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:24,639
so I have to say,
I approve totally.

184
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,383
I just hope you're ready
for whatever happens.

185
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,040
So... are you jealous?

186
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:36,781
Oh, come on.
That's unfair.

187
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,344
Poor Laura. Of course
she's not jealous.

188
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,137
Wouldn't it be deadly, though,

189
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,834
she's always going on about?

190
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:47,836
Hold on a sec.
I just want to buy this.

191
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:49,403
Another book.

192
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:53,320
Doesn't she know
books won't do it?

193
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,323
Listen, sis,

194
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,108
do you think Karen
has some kind of a problem?

195
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:00,806
I mean, she doesn't even
mind a bit that she's a virgin.

196
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Now, what's that about?

197
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,136
I've been going out with her
for three weeks.

198
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,050
She even has
a flat all to herself,
so it's perfectly safe.

199
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:12,316
That's a definition of safe sex
I haven't heard before.

200
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,169
Yeah. Yeah, well,
it's a pain.

201
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,780
I bet you and Adam did it.

202
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:22,176
No, we didn't.

203
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,568
No way.

204
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,181
Way, I'm tellin' you.
Not that I'd mind if he had.

205
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:31,185
So, do you fancy him, too?

206
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:33,230
He's a bit quiet
for my taste, now.

207
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,058
Maybe I'm wrong.
Am I?

208
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:37,191
Why don't you ask Adam?
He just works down here.

209
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,194
No, I'm asking you.

210
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:41,283
Sisters are supposed
to confide in each other
about these things.

211
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,674
Well...

212
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,851
What?
I don't know yet.

213
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:51,162
Oh, I Exactly. well.
TAnyway, listen.n.

214
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:52,642
You mind your own business.

215
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,165
Absolutely.

216
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,275
So, are you coming in?

217
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,659
He's hanging
a new exhibition today.
He'd love you to see it.

218
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,825
No. I'll leave you to it.
I'll catch you later.

219
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,437
All right.

220
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:06,959
Um...

221
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:13,793
you know...

222
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:16,795
I vaguely remember.

223
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:20,191
He seems really happy
to leave it up to me.

224
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,106
It's kind of nice for a change.

225
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:24,849
Ah, now, are you
falling in love, sparrow?

226
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,470
Ohh. Mm. you.

227
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,710
Mm, listen.
You know when we make love
the first time...

228
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,734
What?

229
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:43,882
No, no. I mean
whenever, you know?

230
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,783
Well, I just wanted
to let you know

231
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,224
I want to leave it all
I don't get you, Adam.

232
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,400
Everything. You know,
when and where,

233
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,446
the circumstances.

234
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,274
I want it to happen...

235
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:02,843
I want it to be
exactly the way
you'd like it to be.

236
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:07,196
Is that OK?

237
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:08,807
I'll think about that.

238
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,461
Taller

239
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,464
Than the tallest tree is

240
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,816
That's how it's got to feel

241
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,905
Deeper

242
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:26,366
Than the deep blue sea is

243
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,307
If it's real

244
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:33,745
When somebody needs you

245
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:38,619
It's no good unless he needs you

246
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:44,451
All the way

247
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,388
Through the good and lean years

248
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:51,241
And all the in-between years

249
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,855
Come what may

250
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:05,908
Who knows where
Only a fool could say

251
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:16,876
It's for sure
B I'm gonna love you... ou

252
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:19,376
Oh, I love being
out in the country.

253
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Don't you?

254
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,229
Go away, you waster.

255
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,884
Oh, it was so invigorating,
wasn't it, Adam?

256
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,368
Those winds,
they just clean you out.

257
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:31,672
Brisk, was it?

258
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,693
You're not coming the next time,

259
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:35,395
and you're getting no choc ice.

260
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,420
[laughs]I could
get used to this car.

261
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,462
Did you tell her
the story, by the way?

262
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,119
No, I didn't.
What?

263
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:43,944
Oh, the interesting things
you find out

264
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:45,732
when you're out
on a mountain stroll.

265
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,254
Tell me what?

266
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,345
Should we tell her?
Yeah, what?

267
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:53,097
Even though he was very young
when his mummy and daddy died,

268
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:56,395
Adam remembered
as a little fella that
when they went for walks,

269
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,670
they passed by this
big, fancy car-sales place.

270
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:01,574
His dad had a big thing
about this particular car.

271
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,052
A Jaguar.

272
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:05,157
"Just look at that Jag,"
he'd say.

273
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,121
I thought it must be the most
wonderful thing in the world.

274
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,545
His dad was always
promising his mum

275
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,019
that when they
had a bit of money
to splash out,

276
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:16,284
he'd buy her one.

277
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,374
Years after, when he turned 18

278
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,392
and got the bit of money
that was left to him,

279
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:22,291
he used it all
to buy this car...

280
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,641
to remember them by.

281
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:27,035
Adam...

282
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:32,463
why didn't you I don't know.

283
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,783
Oh, my.

284
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,181
Hey, how are you, man?

285
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:46,141
[laughing]

286
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:48,360
Ah, that young fella's
a lovely drunk,

287
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,469
do you know that?

288
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,471
I think I'd have lasted
with your father

289
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,473
if he hadn't been
such a boring drunk.

290
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:55,803
And better looking.

291
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,980
I mean, look at that.
[raspberry]

292
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,464
I feel sorry for Alice
sometimes.

293
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,683
But you told her
he was a great catch.

294
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,206
Did I?
Yeah.

295
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,429
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Oh, look at him now.

296
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:14,997
Carry him upstairs,
and tuck him into bed?

297
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:21,003
Mm, jump in after him.

298
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:22,700
Sorry, Mum.

299
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm gonna go catch him
before he falls.

300
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,533
Ooh.
[giggling]

301
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:31,969
Hi.

302
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,190
Mm. Hey, I just
promised Alice

303
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,475
that we'd baby-sit
for her and Martin
on Friday night, OK?

304
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:39,579
Oh, but I'm working Friday.

305
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:40,935
Uhh!

306
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,153
Ohh...

307
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,568
I'll do it alone.
She's a lovely baby.

308
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,639
If you want.
Alice will be very grateful.

309
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,206
She is.
She's delighted.

310
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:51,034
Hi, sis.

311
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:56,581
Lucy! Lucy!

312
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:59,216
No, no.
How are you?

313
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:02,393
Fine. I have
to get changed.

314
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:05,527
I won't rush you.
Listen, I'm trying out

315
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,529
some new material
at the club tonight,

316
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,053
and I could put you
on the guest list,
no problem.

317
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:14,621
Thanks, Simon, but by the time
I'm finished here...

318
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:18,014
Look, you don't even
have to talk to me

319
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,610
I'd just love you
to hear the material.
Will you, please?

320
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:25,503
All right.

321
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,244
I'll see.

322
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,290
You all right?

323
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:32,424
Ok. Bye.

324
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:34,731
[audience laughing]

325
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:38,741
You know... I think we could
all be happy if we wanted to be,

326
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,365
but we choose to be unhappy
because it's more interesting.

327
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,189
'Cause there's nothing
as boring as happiness.

328
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:44,904
Happy, happy, happy,
happy, happy, happy.

329
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,936
It's like a big, huge, strange
road that goes on for miles

330
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
and all you can
see in the distance
is Germany.

331
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,576
That's how
I first saw you, Simon.

332
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,143
Educated,
but easily led women,
I hope.

333
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,255
Ha! I thought you were
like that in real life.

334
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,113
Oh, my God.
Did I say the "L" word?

335
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,824
[Simon]Don't-Don't clap
too loud...

336
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,074
[Alice] Hello?

337
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,181
Hello! Alice, are you back?
Has Adam gone yet?

338
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,392
He's still here.
Hold on. Adam, Lucy.

339
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:24,677
Hi. How did it go?
Did Jean behave herself?

340
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,611
Yeah.
What are you up to?

341
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,677
Just thought I'd call
to say I'm thinking about you.

342
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,311
Oh, that's nice.

343
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,576
Can I tell you all about Adam?

344
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:38,360
Ooh, better than
that stand-up comedian

345
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,687
with the shag-me-
or-I-may-kill-myself look?

346
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:45,237
Ha-ha. Simon. Funny onstage.
One-on-one, nightmare.

347
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,501
I know the feeling.

348
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,895
He's really shy,
but, somehow, with me,

349
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,941
I think I brought him
out of himself.

350
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,510
He's gorgeous,
but had no self-confidence.

351
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:58,782
Tell us, are you going off
on holidays together?

352
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,646
Wait'll I tell you
the most fantastic thing he did.

353
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,560
In you go.
Watch your head.

354
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:08,174
We've turned inland,
and we're still heading south.

355
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:12,134
Are you sure?

356
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:18,010
[Lucy]Oh, it was
exhilarating and sexy
and completely confusing,

357
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,839
which, as you know, Andy,
is a combination I like,

358
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,580
but I also liked when Adam
finally brought me

359
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:27,889
to a perfect little
romantic country hotel.

360
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,631
I suppose that's when
I started to realize

361
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,633
the difference between
this relationship

362
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,679
and all the others I had before.

363
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,942
Call it "in love" if you like,

364
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,685
call it more luck than I deserve

365
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:40,947
to meet a guy like Adam.

366
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:42,949
You fancy a weekend away?

367
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,756
Oh, Adam! [laughs]

368
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,564
It's beautiful.

369
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,002
My sister Laura would call it
"a great passion."

370
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:54,481
[owl hoots]

371
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:56,614
Doesn't even cover it.

372
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,791
So, what do you think?

373
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,836
Fabulous.
Really suits you.

374
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:02,577
No. About Adam.

375
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,710
What do you think
from what I told you?

376
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:07,060
From what you've told me,
send him this way.

377
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:08,670
He sounds like God's gift.

378
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,823
Yeah. He does sound right,
doesn't he?

379
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:14,676
What's up with you?
I've never seen you so nervous.

380
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,853
Let's just say
I'm taking a bit of a leap
into the unknown.

381
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:21,727
Just hope I don't make
a complete idiot out of myself.

382
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,749
What could it be

383
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:29,126
You have the power
to hypnotize me

384
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,739
Let me live 'neath your spell

385
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:36,655
Do do that voodoo
that you do so well

386
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:40,616
For you do something to me

387
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:48,276
That nobody else can do

388
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,822
That nobody else can do

389
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:56,458
[cheers and applause]

390
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,880
Thank you. Thank you.
All right. All right.

391
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:05,467
My family's here tonight,
sitting at that table
over there.

392
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,840
We're celebrating
my mum's birthday today.

393
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:11,735
We all love you, Peggy Owens!

394
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,519
Ha-ha!

395
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:18,220
And there's a man down there
in my crowd called Adam.

396
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,439
And he's my fella.

397
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:25,488
And I know my mum
is mad about him,

398
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,668
would be to say that...

399
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,496
Oh, wait! No, no, no!

400
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:39,807
No, no! Wait, wait!

401
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:42,200
So, Adam...

402
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,812
I'm asking you now.

403
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:47,249
Will you marry me?

404
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:53,734
I'd love to.

405
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,694
[cheering]

406
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,701
Unbelievable!

407
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,228
I'm so happy.

408
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,013
Ha-ha-ha!

409
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:14,233
[crying]

410
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,634
Hello! Adam, is it?

411
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:24,895
Mrs. Owens.

412
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,187
Would you like a bit of cake?

413
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,224
It's only bought cake.
I haven't baked in years.

414
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,293
But it's nice.

415
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:33,426
[Laura] Lucy said he was shy.

416
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,779
Doesn't look shy to me.

417
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,869
Oh, poor Mum.

418
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,525
So many boyfriends,
and she tries so hard
to like them all.

419
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,920
Even Martin.

420
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,618
Whatever else I do,
I won't make that mistake.

421
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:54,666
Whatever else I do...
nothing basically.

422
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:58,278
Right. Be nice.

423
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Hello. I'm Adam.

424
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:02,998
Hello. Laura.
The middle sister.

425
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,067
Yeah. Why?

426
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,916
It's strange.
My favorite film is Laura.

427
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,855
Preminger's film?
Yeah, I love it.

428
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,336
And a favorite poem of mine

429
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,053
has a girl called Laura in it.

430
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:15,078
I don't believe it.

431
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,862
You don't mean "Goblin Market"?

432
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,254
Yeah, that's it!

433
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,911
"She cried, 'Laura, '
up the garden.

434
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,174
"'Did you miss me?
Come and kiss me.

435
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:24,696
"'Never mind my bruises.

436
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,003
"'Hug me. Kiss me.

437
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,460
Suck my juices squeezed
from goblin fruits
for you.'"

438
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:30,484
Christina Rossetti.

439
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:31,877
No, I don't believe it.

440
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:33,358
"'Drink me.
Love me, Laura.

441
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
"Make much of me.'"

442
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:37,696
Oh, this is...
I'm doing my thesis on her.

443
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:38,972
Christina Rossetti?

444
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:40,713
Yes. Well, partly.

445
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:42,647
The actual title is,

446
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,935
"A Virginal Whore:
The Tragic Dilemma
of Victorian Women."

447
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:47,000
But, you know, I'm sort of
filtering it through writers

448
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:49,678
like Christina Rossetti
and all the Brontes, of course.

449
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,680
Well, I'm not an academic,

450
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:53,682
but I love the feeling of her...

451
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:54,945
the energy of it.

452
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,468
Absolutely!

453
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,361
You'll probably
laugh at me now,
but it's very...

454
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:01,385
It's very sexy.

455
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:03,948
Yeah, but in an entirely
repressed form.

456
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,914
That's the whole point.
That's what makes it
so exciting.

457
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:09,177
Adam!
I'm all yours.

458
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:13,138
OK. I'll be with you
in a minute.

459
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,704
Bye, Laura.

460
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:17,683
I must read that poem again.
It's been a while.

461
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:20,928
I'm surprised I remembered it.

462
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,930
Uh...

463
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,236
[Adam]Bye, Mrs. Owens.

464
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,152
Behave yourselves.

465
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,502
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

466
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:32,984
Well, isn't he
very nice now, hmm?

467
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:35,421
I'm delighted to see her
fixed up again.

468
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:37,510
She was very upset over Stephen.

469
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:40,469
Simon, Mother,
and it only ended
a few days ago.

470
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,994
Yes, but you know how
Lucy likes company.

471
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,388
She can't amuse herself
on her own like you can.

472
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,651
You're lucky that way.

473
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:02,710
Hello.

474
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:04,015
Hi.

475
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:05,539
Are you doing some research?

476
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:07,236
No. Not really.

477
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:10,824
Actually,
I'm looking for the poem
we talked about last night.

478
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,024
Great!

479
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:14,872
I thought I had it at home,
but I couldn't seem to find it.

480
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,376
I'm sure they'll get it for you.

481
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:17,898
They're very helpful.

482
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:20,671
I'm practically
living here at the moment,

483
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,358
trying to get this thesis
sorted out in my head.

484
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:23,382
I'm sorry. I better go.

485
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:25,709
I'm sure I have the poem
at home somewhere.

486
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:26,995
Adam, you all right?

487
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,256
Yeah. Listen...

488
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:32,045
I hope to see you very soon.

489
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,317
[crying]

490
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,500
Hi.

491
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:57,070
If this is none of my business,
I can just go.

492
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:58,505
No, please.

493
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,136
Really.
Yeah? You sure?

494
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,900
[sniffles]

495
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:08,994
This is just something...
it happens once in a while.

496
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,171
I never know why,
except maybe...

497
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:12,956
I don't know.

498
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:16,370
When I'm feeling
some really strong
emotion of some kind,

499
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,048
I get this flash.

500
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,094
It all comes back to me.

501
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:22,661
I mean, is it something...

502
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:27,158
would it be any use
to talk or...?

503
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:30,446
Laura, can you keep a secret?
No one else must know.

504
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,802
Of course, yeah.

505
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:39,113
Great. Thanks. Yeah.

506
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,638
My mother died when I was young.

507
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,572
Oh, God, no.

508
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:46,139
Too young to remember, even.
That's not the thing.

509
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:50,036
But... so for years,
it was just my dad and me.

510
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,341
Mm-hmm.

511
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,653
As soon as I was
old enough to drive,

512
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:55,568
he taught me
and made me do the test.

513
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:59,134
I passed it,
and the very next day,
he bought me this car.

514
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:00,831
Just like that?

515
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:02,398
Oh, yeah. Out of the blue.

516
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:04,356
I'd say he spent
his last penny on it.

517
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,880
Then the day after that...

518
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:10,580
he disappeared, and I never
heard from him again.

519
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:13,148
Oh, Adam, I'm so sorry.

520
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:15,150
I still don't know why
he ran away.

521
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:18,109
I mean, I understand
the sort of man he was.

522
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,242
He... he had great passion.

523
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:22,157
Oh, my God.

524
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:25,203
Yeah. He was always likely
to do something extreme.

525
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:29,164
But I can't get rid of the fear
that it was all my fault...

526
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:32,863
Oh, no, no! You must know
that's not true!

527
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,254
That's why every so often,
like now, I don't know...

528
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,178
This feeling wells up.

529
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:45,200
And always when I'm having...

530
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:47,444
What? What? What?!

531
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:50,186
Um... sorry.

532
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:53,928
I shouldn't let my own passions
get the better of me.

533
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,148
Look, sorry. I know
you've got work to do.

534
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,889
Oh, that's fine.

535
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:00,979
Maybe we could have
a good chat sometime.

536
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:02,720
Of course.
I would love that.

537
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:06,989
Do you know that
I've actually got...

538
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:08,223
Are you sure?

539
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:09,944
Really. I'm fine.

540
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:11,772
Hug?

541
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:20,279
Work hard.
I hope to see you
very soon.

542
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:22,914
OK.

543
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,746
Bye.

544
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:30,183
Even his name, it's so not you.

545
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:32,620
It's primal. Adam.

546
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:34,448
Yeah. It's a crap name
all right.

547
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,770
And he reads. He can quote
Christina Rossetti.

548
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:38,626
Oh. What did he
do that for?

549
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:41,542
It came up. She's not exactly
a household name as a poet,

550
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:44,197
so I have to say
I approve totally.

551
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:47,113
I just hope you're ready
for whatever happens.

552
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:50,116
Oh. Sure.
I'm full of surprises.

553
00:27:50,595 --> 00:27:52,249
Can she sense
something on my face?

554
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:54,120
So... are you jealous?

555
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,948
Oh, come on.
That's unfair.

556
00:27:56,253 --> 00:27:58,298
She's looking at you.
Do something.

557
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,953
And stop talking about Adam,
for a start.

558
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:02,259
I'll buy something.

559
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:05,258
There's that book
I'd like him to read.

560
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:06,654
Will I?

561
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:08,788
I will.
Yes, I'll buy it.

562
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:14,620
Hold on a sec.
I just want to buy this.

563
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:16,186
Nothing, I suppose.

564
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,310
And the kiss.
What about the little kiss?

565
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,465
Well, he's probably
just a very tactile person.

566
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:22,192
I'll ask Lucy. No, I won't.
She'll suspect...

567
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:23,802
Laura.
What?!

568
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,674
You forgot your change.

569
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,633
Oh, right! My...

570
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,331
Here you go.

571
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:32,506
Thanks.

572
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,323
So, what's the book, anyway?

573
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:37,445
Hmm? Oh, nothing. Poetry.
You wouldn't be interested.

574
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,297
Laura, that's
a mean thing to say.

575
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,909
You're right.
I'm so sorry, Luce.

576
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:46,782
I just hate it
when I forget things.

577
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:52,311
But I'm delighted everything's
going so well for you.

578
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,184
"To Adam. Lots of love..."

579
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,752
No, no, no.
I can't use "love."

580
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,928
That wouldn't be right.

581
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,234
If Lucy saw that...

582
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,019
um...

583
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,241
To Adam...

584
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,983
poet lovers of the world unite!

585
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,399
Oh, no, that's...
that's too jolly,

586
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:23,405
I need something friendly,
warm and safe.

587
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,345
To Adam... looking forward
to lots of chats. Laura.

588
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,411
Oh, lots of chats is awful!

589
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,524
That's so "ladies who lunch."

590
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:34,265
To Adam... welcome
to the family. Laura.

591
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:36,921
Ugh. What does that mean?
That sounds like the Mafia.

592
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,447
Oh, no, no, no.

593
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:42,927
Oh, no. I can't say that.

594
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,366
To Adam...

595
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:49,891
I hope this book
will mean as much to you

596
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,329
as it does to me. Laura.

597
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:57,377
Yes!

598
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,386
Hi.

599
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,432
Look what I'm reading.

600
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:10,911
Oh.

601
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:13,393
I was just thinking about
buying it.

602
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:14,871
Oh, no. Don't.

603
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:16,264
Why not?

604
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:26,353
I can't say, but please
doYou're funny.t.

605
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,974
OK, I'll hold off.

606
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,848
Are you, uh...?

607
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,416
Just a college friend,
if you want to join us.

608
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:36,764
No, it's OK.

609
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:38,952
It's not a problem.
We were just...

610
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,423
No, I couldn't. If you
were on your own, maybe...

611
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:48,733
Anyway, listen, I've...

612
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:52,389
Um... uh... bye.

613
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:02,004
OK, the vampire thing
is a symbol of male domination
through blood and semen.

614
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:03,401
Yeah, fine, we know that.

615
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,062
But it doesn't
go anywhere, does it?

616
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,405
Exactly. Damn.
Where are my fucking fags?

617
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,059
Here, have one of these.

618
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:13,846
Since when are you smoking?

619
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:16,675
Actually, I will
have one, though.

620
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:24,770
What were we saying?

621
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,337
Male domination.
Semen.

622
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:27,555
Oh, right.

623
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,331
You see, to me,
Stoker's notion
of Dracula

624
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,305
is just part of that
whole Victorian view
of women

625
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:35,844
as passive occasions of sin
or helpless preys to temptation.

626
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,748
Exactly. That's why
you'll love this production.

627
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:41,067
It asserts
the absolute right of women
to access raw desire,

628
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:42,808
no matter how dangerous
the sexual consequences.

629
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:44,834
Absolutely.

630
00:31:45,356 --> 00:31:48,708
So in the end,
Dracula can actually become
a feminist sexual fantasy.

631
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:53,496
A sort of antidote to all that
Victorian paternalistic
male bullshit. Oh, shh.

632
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:55,672
[eerie breathing]

633
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,501
[Dracula]I do not
drink... blood.

634
00:31:58,762 --> 00:32:01,678
I do not drink blood.

635
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:04,550
Blood. Blood.

636
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:06,072
[all gasp]

637
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:13,298
Excuse me, please.

638
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,866
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

639
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:31,622
Are you all right?
Didn't you enjoy it?

640
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:36,540
Yeah. I haven't done any work
for over a week.

641
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:37,975
How do you mean?

642
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:40,805
I've done nothing.
I'm just... I'm stuck.

643
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:42,327
Don't worry about it.

644
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,056
I don't believe
in what I'm doing anymore.

645
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,351
Go away out of that.
Your thesis...

646
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,463
Yes!
But it's a great idea.

647
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,596
McCormick is only after
saying to me...

648
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,556
Yes, it all works fine
as an idea,

649
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:53,991
but I know now it...

650
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,516
it just isn't true.

651
00:32:56,864 --> 00:32:58,866
Oh, God, I can feel it!

652
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,086
You don't think
I look fat in it, do you?

653
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,199
Oh, no, no. It's beautiful,
if you don't mind paying for it.

654
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:09,943
And Martin's face
when he sees
the Visa bill.

655
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,270
[laughs]

656
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:17,645
Yeah, I think that's it.

657
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:19,453
Mr. Drummond to Menswear.

658
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:31,725
[laughs]

659
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,031
[gasps]

660
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:34,773
Adam.

661
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:38,254
Oh, where...

662
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:42,824
where...

663
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:49,309
Adam!

664
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:01,583
Oh, God. Alice!

665
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:03,063
Laura.

666
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:05,921
Listen, I just saw Adam.
He's coming down.

667
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:08,503
Oh, the boy. Great.
Haven't seen him since the night
of the great first date.

668
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:09,721
I should...

669
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,740
So how are he and Lucy
getting on, by the way?

670
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:15,815
All right. I don't know
if it'll last.

671
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,989
Too what?

672
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:18,992
Hmm? Too thoughtful
for Lucy.

673
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:20,602
Oh.

674
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,561
Where is he?

675
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:25,563
He'll be down.
Let's see what he thinks.

676
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:28,301
Oh, God. This is terrible.
We couldn't have missed him,
could we?

677
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,691
Relal don't understand! ably
bl don't understand it!

678
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:46,803
Jesus!

679
00:34:47,282 --> 00:34:49,284
[panting]

680
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,744
But I saw him
go up the escalator!

681
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:56,702
You're making an absolute
exhibition of yourself!

682
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:57,726
I didn't imagine it!

683
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,714
I know you didn't imagine it.

684
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,448
I know you saw him, and
he's probably wandered off
somewhere, that's all.

685
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:04,995
It's nothing to
get into a trauma over.

686
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:07,606
But I keep seeing him,
meeting him...

687
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:09,739
[panting]

688
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:13,656
unexpectedly.

689
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:18,226
So, when you and Adam
do get to meet up,

690
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,578
what do you talk about?

691
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:25,495
Ah, my sick mind.
Don't worry about it.

692
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,062
What?
Worry about what?

693
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,064
Nothing, Laura.
You know me.

694
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,042
I just wondered whether...
I don't know...

695
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:33,740
whether you talked
about personal stuff.

696
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,764
You know, intimate.

697
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:36,724
Oh, come on, Laura.
Let's say...

698
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:39,161
things about your looks
or sexy talk.

699
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:40,771
No! Nothing like that.

700
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,673
Alice, really!
Not everything has to be...

701
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:45,058
seedy and cynical and all that.

702
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:48,265
In fact, I think that Adam
has some deep tragedy

703
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:50,738
lurking underneath
the surface. I really do.

704
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,914
Oh, right.
Didn't spot that one.

705
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:54,742
But I've hardly met him.

706
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,624
You obviously know him
much better.

707
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:00,419
No, I don't.
But I... oh, my God.

708
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:00,748
No, no. It's Simon.

709
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,270
Who's Simon?

710
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:04,585
Lucy's ex.
He's a stand-up comedian.

711
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,687
Isn't that strange?
Just as we were talking
about... um, hello.

712
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,235
Oh, hi.
It's Lucy's...

713
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:10,714
Sister.

714
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:13,196
Don't tell me.
I know it.

715
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:14,718
Uh, Laura.

716
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:17,722
Laura. Hi, Laura.
How is Lucy?

717
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,202
Oh, fine, fine.
You know Lucy.

718
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:21,789
You should give her a call.
You never know, you know.

719
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,728
Oh, really?
I'd love to.

720
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:26,076
I've got some new material,
and it'd be great if...

721
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:27,426
Oh...
But, no.

722
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,344
No? Do you want to...

723
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:36,654
Oh.

724
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:39,309
Honk honk.

725
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,795
[laughs]

726
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,666
He's much more her type.

727
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:50,973
I'm sure you're right.

728
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:53,367

[people chatting]

730
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,123
Oh!
You heading out?

731
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:12,125
Why are you always
prying into my life?

732
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:14,127
Can't you just
mind your own business?

733
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,738
If I feel like going out,
I'll just go out! All right?

734
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:19,698
All right.

735
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:25,747
[door opens]

736
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:26,748
What's up with her?

[door slams]

738
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,077
Don't ask me. I was only going
to tell her to take a coat.

739
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:32,101
Ohh!

[man] Hello?

746
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,267
Adam, is that you?

747
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:10,010
Oh, my God.
Laura, is it?

748
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,883
Adam, listen, I know
this sounds really silly,

749
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:17,888
but did I see you in
Brown Thomas the other day?

750
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:19,323
Yes.

751
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,805
Yes, you did, Laura.

752
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:23,807
And what happened, exactly?

753
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:26,898
Well, I was going up
the escalator

754
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,074
and I heard you call me,

755
00:38:29,596 --> 00:38:30,771
and then I...

756
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,261
then I waved to tell you
I was coming back down.

757
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,909
Right. Right. OK, now
please tell me so I'll know.

758
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,434
Are you avoiding me?

759
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:44,785
No. Not at all.

760
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:46,047
In fact, Laura...

761
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:48,920
Oh, God.

762
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:52,358
There's nothing I'd like more
than to see you now.

763
00:38:52,836 --> 00:38:54,055
[sighs]

764
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:55,535
Laura?

765
00:38:56,623 --> 00:38:58,625
Laura, can you?

766
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,585
Will you come now?

767
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:13,075
This is why
I didn't want you
to buy that book.

768
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,860
I... I hope
you don't mind
what I wrote.

769
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,867
That's really beautiful.

[sighs]

771
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,871
I don't know
what's happening to me.

772
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:29,874
At the strangest times,
you pop into my head.

773
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,921
I suddenly have
little conversations.

774
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:35,141
They're always with you.

775
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:37,926
I smile, and I feel happy.

776
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:39,362
It's happening to me, too.

777
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:42,975
And then, as well as that...

778
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,154
No, I can't say it.
What?

779
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:49,032
No, I can't.
You'll think I'm weird.

780
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,896
Please tell me.

781
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:52,942
No. No, don't ask me.

782
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:54,944
Adam, you must
be honest with me!

783
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:56,598
Please!

784
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,735

785
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:15,008
you ...I imagined you...

786
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:17,793
Oh.

787
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,623
Is that really sick?

788
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:30,023
No.

I don't know. He's being
an old sly boots.

794
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,675
He said I was to be here
at six this evening.

795
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:55,005
Wouldn't tell me why.
So?

796
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,615
Are you in on it?

797
00:40:58,226 --> 00:41:00,306
Ah, sure he's one
of the glorious mysteries,
that boy.

798
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:02,902
You wouldn't know
what's going on
in his dotty little head.

and I know my mum
is mad about him.

I could give her

Fine. Marry who you like.

00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:24,387
Are you going to tell Lucy?

874
00:45:24,411 --> 00:45:25,411
God, no!

875
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,283
No!

876
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:30,591
Your whole family
would disown you,
shun you.

877
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:34,334
You'd be denounced
as a jezebel, a fiend.

878
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:38,948
God, Laura, I couldn't bear
to see you treated that way.

879
00:45:41,298 --> 00:45:42,952
I'm crazy about you.

880
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,260
It's-it's like you said.

881
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:51,003
And planning
our whole lives together.

882
00:45:52,744 --> 00:45:55,225
It's a different
kind of passion.

883
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:58,335
Stop thinking, Laura.

884
00:45:58,359 --> 00:45:59,577
Just go with it.

885
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:04,713
Oh, God! Those women!
Those stupid women!

886
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,191
Who?

887
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,542
My Victorian women!

888
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:10,956
Putting all that mad passion
into their novels and poems

889
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,331
instead of just... doing it!

890
00:46:14,549 --> 00:46:16,246
Ohh, yeah!

891
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:19,921
Of course, if they had,
we'd have missed out on
a lot of great literature.

892
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,663
Nah. They'd have
found something else
to write about.

893
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,341
Ohh, exactly!

894
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:28,781
That's what my thesis
will be... about!

895
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:31,784
[moaning]

896
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:32,785
Ohh!

897
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:35,179
Ohh!

898
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,356
Ha-ha. God!

899
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,794
What?

900
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,319
Those women went through
all that hysteria,

901
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,409
but they never came out
the other side.

902
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,998
They never managed to realize
that you don't lose your soul
or do yourself in,

903
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:54,372
you just... move on.

904
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:56,481
Move on?

905
00:46:56,505 --> 00:46:59,421
Yeah. From one great adventure
to the next,

906
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:02,336
thrilled by the last one,
but not afraid of the next one.

907
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:05,079
Oh, God. I can't wait
to get started.

908
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,345
On what?

909
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:15,699
[cell phone rings]

910
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,440
Hello?

911
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,137
Davey, hi.

912
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:22,222
[softly]
It's your brother.

913
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,800
YYeah. Sorry.
I just forgot the time.

914
00:47:30,322 --> 00:47:31,454
I got distracted.

915
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:34,718
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right over.

916
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,371
OK, bye.

917
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:38,809
I promised Dave

918
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,985
I'd call over to him
and Karen tonight.

919
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:44,379
Do you mind if we go now?

920
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:50,493
[cell phone ringing]

921
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:51,823
Ha! Go on!

922
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:55,653
Hello?

923
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:57,176
Hello?

924
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:59,221
Hello?

925
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:00,526
[click]

926
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:02,398
That was strange.

927
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:05,489
All this deception...

928
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,404
really makes me feel nervous.

929
00:48:08,796 --> 00:48:11,364
Isn't it fantastic?
[giggles]

930
00:48:13,322 --> 00:48:14,454
Mm.

931
00:48:16,108 --> 00:48:17,948
I feel like I'm being watched
all the time now.

932
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,023
Under surveillance.

933
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:20,721
[laughing]

934
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,376
But that's it, isn't it?

935
00:48:23,724 --> 00:48:25,726
You just have to...

936
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:28,250
take a risk and do something.

937
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:32,038
Then you find out.
[bottle rolls]

938
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:34,083
[chuckles]

939
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:35,694
What's the matter?

940
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,217
Oh, nothin'.

941
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:39,219
It's just I was thinkin'

942
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:42,396
life is exhilarating
all the same, isn't it?

943
00:48:42,744 --> 00:48:44,790
Oh, absolutely!

944
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,969
Where can I drop you?

945
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:52,058
The library.

946
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,587
[TV announcer] As many men
goal side as they can

947
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:01,022
and stop this...

948
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:02,416
[women laughing]

949
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,333
[David] Why me? Why me
and a house full of women?

950
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:08,485
That stupid joke
Auntie Patsy used to make...

951
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,467
"Oh, blessed art thou
among women."

952
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:12,731
OK, so it's Mum's birthday.
I love her.

953
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,559
Happy birthday, Mum.

954
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:18,496
But do we have to have
all this female stuff
going on all the time?

955
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,740
Do we have to watch this?
Yes, we do.

956
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:24,004
And I wouldn't mind if
they weren't such clichés...

957
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,875
Real girlies.
"Nyah, football?"

958
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:27,834
Jesus.

959
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:29,879
Do you think Adam
will like my hairdo?

960
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,402
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

961
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,256
At least, lately, Adam gives
me a bit of normal company.

962
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:38,298
So much better
than the ponytail pricks
Lucy usually ends up with.

963
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:39,604
Is Karen coming tonight
as well, love?

964
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:41,021
Yeah, she is.
Oh, good.

965
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,545
Jesus. Nag, nag, nag.

966
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:45,217
Shouldn't you be collectin' her?

967
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:46,461
I will! I'm going soon.

968
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:49,417
Should I ask Adam's advice
about Karen?

969
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:51,834
Yeah. Although I bet
Lucy's already told him
we haven't done it yet.

970
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,120
Jesus! The humiliation.

971
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:56,403
Meanwhile, her and Adam
have been banging away
like cats.

972
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,691
Yes. Adam will love this.

973
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:01,042
God, he has her
eating out of his hand.

974
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:04,088
That surprise weekend
he took her away on...
Cool move.

975
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,178
Bet she came like
a runaway train that night.
Yes, yes! Come on!

976
00:50:07,614 --> 00:50:08,974
Would you not go
and collect Karen?

977
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,107
We're supposed to be
at the restaurant at nine.

978
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:12,836
All right, all right.
I'm going.

979
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:14,490
You'll meet Adam tonight.

980
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:17,382
I think he and Lucy are
really gettin' it together.

981
00:50:17,406 --> 00:50:18,862
Yeah?

982
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,646
Yeah. They went away
for a surprise
romantic weekend

983
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,237
to this amazing country hotel.

984
00:50:22,672 --> 00:50:23,978
Sounds gorgeous.

985
00:50:25,806 --> 00:50:27,131
Yeah. Lucy was saying
it was really, like,
you know, just perfect.

986
00:50:27,155 --> 00:50:28,504
And your Mum didn't mind?
Peggy?

987
00:50:28,852 --> 00:50:30,612
No, she's pretty cool
about things like that.

988
00:50:30,637 --> 00:50:32,508
Good for Peggy.
Mines would have a stroke.

989
00:50:32,856 --> 00:50:33,988
Only if she found out.

990
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,793
Oh, I'd never keep
somethin' like that a secret.

991
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:39,733
Great.
Fucking brilliant.

992
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:41,865
So...

993
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,390
Adam. [giggles]

994
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:46,131
I'm askin' you now.

995
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:47,785
Will you marry me?

996
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:49,787
Jesus Christ.

997
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:58,274
I'd love to.

998
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:01,799
[cheers and applause]

999
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:06,108
That's the most romantic
thing I've ever seen!

1000
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,371
You were right, David.

1001
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:10,025
Adam's gorgeous.

1002
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:12,375
Yeah, I told you.

1003
00:51:14,594 --> 00:51:16,727
Adam. Adam,
can I ask your advice?

1004
00:51:17,162 --> 00:51:18,381
Of course, David.

1005
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:20,905
It's, you know,
like sex and stuff.

1006
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,740
Ah, that's right up
my alley. Shoot.

1007
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:24,921
Well, 'cause you're like
my brother-in-law now.

1008
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,433
I am! And your pal.

1009
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:28,392
Well, I hope so.

1010
00:51:28,784 --> 00:51:32,048
I am so. Go on.
You were saying? Sex.

1011
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:33,527
It's a bit complicated.

1012
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:34,919
Always is.

1013
00:51:36,182 --> 00:51:37,902
But if you were to put it
into one sentence,

1014
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:39,640
Karen won't give you
the goods. Is that it?

1015
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:42,058
Yeah! How did you know?

1016
00:51:42,493 --> 00:51:44,408
Intuition.
I can see these things.

1017
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
And Lucy told me.

1018
00:51:46,149 --> 00:51:47,977
That bitch.
She meant well.

1019
00:51:48,412 --> 00:51:49,979
Listen,
you're too drunk
to discuss this,

1020
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:52,014
and to be honest with you,
I'm too happy.

1021
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,416
I'm in love, man!

1022
00:51:54,418 --> 00:51:55,738
Look, we'll
get together soon, OK?

1023
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:56,767
OK, Adam.
All right.

1024
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,901
Thanks.
Wash your hands.

1025
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,316
[David]It's not like
she wants to wait till
we're married or anything.

1026
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,926
It's not like
a Catholic thing.
So, what, then?

1027
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,230
Come on, would you
get rid of it?

1028
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:07,910
She just says, "Don't hassle me.

1029
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:10,827
Leave me to make up
my own mind."
And?

1030
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:14,178
I do. I leave her alone.
I don't mention it.

1031
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:15,919
And?
Nothing.

1032
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:18,269
Nothin'?
Nothin'.

1033
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:19,704
[both]Yeah!

1034
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,751
[all groan]

1035
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,982
[TV announcer] If you
just bet your house on...

1036
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,669
So how long do you wait
before bringin' it up again?

1037
00:52:28,018 --> 00:52:29,454
Oh, God.
Two, sometimes three days.

1038
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,065
Fair enough. And does she
offer any hope at all?

1039
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:34,546
Oh, yeah. She says,
"You know I love you,

1040
00:52:34,938 --> 00:52:36,858
and I want to show my love
for you in every way."

1041
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,594
Like, every way.
She said that specifically.

1042
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:42,641
"But you have to trust me,
and if it takes a little time,

1043
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:44,913
won't it be so much more
special when we do it?"

1044
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:46,776
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1045
00:52:47,254 --> 00:52:48,473
But she's gorgeous, Adam.

1046
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,910
I mean, I'm so fuckin'
horny for her,

1047
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,566
I can't drop her, you know?

1048
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:56,787
She's driving me crazy.
I'm completely obsessed by her.

1049
00:52:57,178 --> 00:52:59,790
Oh! Ref, for fuck's sake!

1050
00:53:00,181 --> 00:53:01,792
Yellow card. It has to be.

1051
00:53:02,227 --> 00:53:04,147
I can't believe he's gonna
let him off with that.

1052
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:05,926
She's definitely
not bangin' someone else?

1053
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:08,102
What? I never even
thought of that.

1054
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:10,975
No. No. No way.

1055
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,585
No. Definitely no.

1056
00:53:12,977 --> 00:53:14,413
You sure?

1057
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:16,676
Yeah, I'm sure.

1058
00:53:17,024 --> 00:53:19,418
I think you're right.
Here's what's happening.

1059
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:21,853
She's pretendin' that
she wants the right to choose

1060
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:24,466
when and where
and how and so on,
but, in fact,

1061
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:27,513
she wants it
completely taken
out of her hands.

1062
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,558
I don't get ya.

1063
00:53:31,778 --> 00:53:32,929
She doesn't want you askin',
'cause that means that she
has to say yes at that time.

1064
00:53:32,953 --> 00:53:36,304
No! She wants no choice.

1065
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,283
Like in a situation
where it has to happen.

1066
00:53:38,307 --> 00:53:41,354
You're saying I should jump her.

1067
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:43,617
No.

1068
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:46,489
Much more subtle than that.

1069
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:48,143
Let me think about it.

1070
00:53:48,535 --> 00:53:49,841
[announcer talking excitedly]

1071
00:53:50,232 --> 00:53:52,669
Yeah!

1072
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:54,846
[honking]
[yelling]

1073
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,544
It must be so easy to score
with a car like this.

1074
00:53:57,936 --> 00:54:01,243
[laughs]Why do you think
I bought it?

1075
00:54:01,678 --> 00:54:02,718
My dad always used to say,

1076
00:54:03,985 --> 00:54:05,944
"Rolls-Royce for class,
Mercedes for comfort,

1077
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:08,816
but a Jaguar
is sex on wheels."

1078
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:11,384
I never liked my dad much,
but he was right about that.

1079
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:12,864
Yeah.

1080
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:15,518
Even Karen would
roll over if I had this.

1081
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,217
Don't worry. She will.

1082
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,919
Has she her own phone,
or is it a pay phone
in the hall?

1083
00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:25,703
A pay phone. Why?

1084
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:27,967
Good.

1085
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:29,577
Perfect.

1086
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:31,796
Now, we need rain
for this thing to work.

1087
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:35,409
Shouldn't be
too much of a problem
in this fuckin' town.

1088
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:40,588
Do either of you cook?
No.

1089
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,329
Never mind.

1090
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:46,483
Invite me around
for Chinese takeaway
or something and a good video.

1091
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:48,528
I'll bring plenty of wine,
make it seem very spontaneous.

1092
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,032
Will that be all right?
Will she mind?

1093
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:53,882
No, that should be OK.
We're always lookin' for
somethin' different to do.

1094
00:54:53,906 --> 00:54:55,579
She thought the whole thing
in the restaurant
the other night

1095
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:56,734
was really romantic.

1096
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,780
She'll love
meetin' you again.
Good.

1097
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:00,434
Yes, very nice.

1098
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:02,107
[thunder]

1099
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,491
Now, I will arrive
at exactly 8:30.

1100
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,972
It's vital that you answer
the front door alone.

1101
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:08,245
Don't let Karen come down.
Why?

1102
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:09,923
Just don't. Right?

1103
00:55:12,273 --> 00:55:14,753
So we have our food
and a few drinks.

1104
00:55:15,102 --> 00:55:16,668
We keep it very light.

1105
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:22,587
Make sure Karen drinks plenty.

1106
00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:24,739
Getting her drunk?
I tried that. Didn't work.

1107
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:27,070
Don't worry.
It's much more than that.

1108
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:29,072
[giggles]

1109
00:55:29,464 --> 00:55:31,640
[all laughing]

1110
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:34,295
We'll watch the film,
and you'll be very relaxed.

1111
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:36,645
Then around 1:00,
I'll say goodbye.

1112
00:55:37,037 --> 00:55:38,037
And that's it?

1113
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,954
No! That's
when it all happens.

1114
00:55:41,302 --> 00:55:43,217
[engine won't start]

1115
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:59,495
Oh, Jesus!

1116
00:55:59,886 --> 00:56:01,888
What a night
for a breakdown, eh?

1117
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,847
Oh. Listen,
I'd better call a taxi.

1118
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,545
I hope you can at this hour.

1119
00:56:07,024 --> 00:56:10,071
Oh, no.
Listen, is that dead?

1120
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:13,161
Yeah.
Completely dead.

1121
00:56:13,552 --> 00:56:14,989
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Adam.

1122
00:56:15,424 --> 00:56:17,513
It must be the weather
or somethin'. What a mess.

1123
00:56:17,904 --> 00:56:20,784
Well, look, let's go back
upstairs where it's warm,
and we'll sort it out.

1124
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,779
No, it's OK. I'm fine.

1125
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,173
Jesus, what a night.

1126
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:27,175
I'll just walk
until I get a cab.

1127
00:56:27,566 --> 00:56:29,886
There's no way
we're gonna let you
walk out in that weather.

1128
00:56:30,091 --> 00:56:31,179
Yeah, Adam. It's crazy.

1129
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:34,028
So I get a bit wet.
It'll be an adventure.

1130
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:36,141
Look, I won't let you
walk out in that weather.

1131
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:40,363
You won't? Oh.

1132
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:44,280
OK. So, what will we do, then?

1133
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:47,022
[thunder]

1134
00:56:47,413 --> 00:56:52,114
Ah, perfect. I'll just
sleep here on the couch.
Yeah, you sleep there.

1135
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:54,986
Mm. It's nice and warm.
We'll get you a blanket.

1136
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,988
No need. Now
you guys get to sleep.

1137
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,380
I'll be fine.

1138
00:56:58,729 --> 00:56:59,904
Sounds cool, Karen.

1139
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,515
Incredible. Unbelievable.

1140
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,517
How could she do that to me?

1141
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:07,520
How could she humiliate me
like that in front of you?

1142
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:11,109
She'd prefer to sleep alone
on an uncomfortable couch
than sleep in a bed with me.

1143
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:13,744
Am I so awful? Like, do I
have a smell or somethin'?

1144
00:57:14,136 --> 00:57:15,746
No, Dave,
you're a very sweet guy.

1145
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:17,779
You don't deserve
to be treated like that.

1146
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:19,794
I misjudged her.
I admit it.

1147
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,796
But it was working perfectly...

1148
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:25,733
the rain, the drink,
the car, the phone,
the air of the night.

1149
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:27,411
I thought I was in like Flynn.

1150
00:57:27,802 --> 00:57:29,413
Ugh! Adam,
what am I gonna do?

1151
00:57:29,848 --> 00:57:32,938
Hey, hey, it's OK.
Don't be upset.

1152
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:34,940
It's not your fault.
It's hers.

1153
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:37,638
She's holdin' back.

1154
00:57:38,074 --> 00:57:39,684
You're the giving one.

1155
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:41,512
Think about it.

1156
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:44,645
You're warm and loving
and sensual.

1157
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:47,387
You've got a lot
to offer, David.

1158
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:49,389
If only Karen could realize

1159
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:51,870
the pleasure you could give her.

1160
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:54,046
I understand how you feel...

1161
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:56,092
the ache in the pit
of the stomach

1162
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,095
every time you think of her.

1163
00:57:59,531 --> 00:58:00,619
Look, Karen doesn't...

1164
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:04,405
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus, no.

1165
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:05,972
What's goin' on?

1166
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:09,715
I'm getting an erection.
I can't stop it.

1167
00:58:10,107 --> 00:58:12,239
I'm getting a hard-on for Adam.

1168
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:14,241
Oh, God, don't let him notice.

1169
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,025
The heat of your passion...

1170
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,898
Please, don't tell me
I'm queer as well.

1171
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,118
How could she resist you then?

1172
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:25,122
Right so. Night, Adam.

1173
00:58:25,513 --> 00:58:28,821
Are you OK?

1174
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:30,213
Are you very upset?

1175
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,476
No! No, no, no.

1176
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:34,435
Just really tired.
Gotta sleep, you know?

1177
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:36,655
It's been a mad night.
Gotta sleep.

1178
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,310
Have to. Really tired,
Adam. You know.

1179
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:41,486
Night. Give yourself
lots of room there.

1180
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:44,142
I'm fine like this.
I always sleep this way.

1181
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:46,144
Sure.

1182
00:58:46,535 --> 00:58:47,841
Night, David.

1183
00:58:51,105 --> 00:58:55,631
Oh, please, erection.
Please go away. Please!

1184
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:57,503
This is nice.

1185
00:58:57,938 --> 00:58:58,938
[whimpers]

1186
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,245
Oh, God.

1187
00:59:02,682 --> 00:59:04,510
Oh, Adam!

1188
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:12,866
[Karen]Adam!
[giggling]

1189
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,694
[Adam chuckles]

1190
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:21,962
[both laughing]

1191
00:59:32,974 --> 00:59:34,934
[Fun Lovin' Criminals]
Barry White, Barry White...

1192
00:59:35,324 --> 00:59:36,760
[David] You bastard.

1193
00:59:37,196 --> 00:59:38,719
You've ruined my life.

1194
00:59:40,808 --> 00:59:42,351
You screwed my girlfriend
and turned me into
a homosexual.

1195
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,724
I might as well kill myself.

1196
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,292
Or kill you, maybe. Yeah.

1197
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:48,816
God, I hope I'm not
in love with you, you shit.

1198
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,210
Isn't he great?

1199
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:53,647
Yeah. Amazing.

1200
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:58,086
You know, we talked
for hours last night
while you were asleep.

1201
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,478
You talked?

1202
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,502
Yeah.
Neither of us could sleep.

1203
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:02,743
The storm probably.

1204
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:06,139
Anyway, we ended up talking
and talking, and, God,

1205
01:00:06,355 --> 01:00:08,575
I don't know if it's the way
he says things, or what,

1206
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,665
but suddenly you start
to see everything

1207
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,102
in a completely different way.

1208
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,775
[voice echoes]A lot of it
was about you, you know.

1209
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,236
Really?

1210
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:18,542
Yeah.

1211
01:00:18,934 --> 01:00:22,111
I didn't realize.
I was very flattered.

1212
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:25,245
And if Barry White
saved your life

1213
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,290
Or got you back
with your ex-wife

1214
01:00:27,682 --> 01:00:29,118
Sing Barry White...
Yeah.

1215
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,599

01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,429
And then she said Adam
was so beautiful.

1217
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,865
Yeah?

1218
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,826
Yeah. Adam really made me think,
all right. Listen...

1219
01:00:42,262 --> 01:00:44,829
I'm supposed to have
a lecture at 11,

1220
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:47,267
but I can cancel that.

1221
01:00:47,702 --> 01:00:52,489
What do you say we have
a nice lazy mornin' together?

1222
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:53,969
Just us.

1223
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:55,972
Ohh!
[moaning]

1224
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:57,364
Yes!

1225
01:00:57,539 --> 01:00:58,801
Oh, Adam. Thank you.

1226
01:00:59,236 --> 01:01:00,933
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1227
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:05,286
Yes! Ooh.

1228
01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:09,986
Life is wonderful.

1229
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:11,814
[woman laughs]

1230
01:01:12,249 --> 01:01:14,599
Lucy! Horsing around
with Adam as usual.

1231
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:15,992
Aah!

1232
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,995
What a fantastic couple
they are.

1233
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:21,476
So together.

1234
01:01:22,477 --> 01:01:26,698
Oh, Jesus. No.

1235
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:28,831
[laughing]

1236
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:30,311
Simon?

1237
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,051
Oh, Lucy.

1238
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:34,010
What?

1239
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,584
[Alice]Thanks very much.
Bye! Bye.

1240
01:01:42,019 --> 01:01:43,019
Bye-bye!
Bye!

1241
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,150
Bye.
Bye!

1242
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:45,369
[Peggy]Bye!

1243
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:47,241
Bye!

1244
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:50,027
Well, now, that Adam fellow
seems a bit more on the ball

1245
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:52,379
than those other weirdos
Lucy usually brings home.

1246
01:01:52,725 --> 01:01:53,770
Don't you think?

1247
01:01:55,206 --> 01:01:56,488
I know it's just
a first impression
on that, but...

1248
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,818
Holy Baholy. Is this his?

1249
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:01,090
This is a '60s classic.
This'd be worth about...

1250
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:04,041
Martin.
Martin, please.

1251
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,043
Shut up. Remember
what we agreed?

1252
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:07,784
We don't need to talk shite...

1253
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:09,805
You mean a normal
civilized conversation?

1254
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:11,149
When we're on our own together.

1255
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,138
It might make things
a little more bearable.

1256
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:22,365
I just want you to know
that it's a very
famous classic car,

1257
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,367
and it's worth a lot of money.

1258
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:26,325
[ turns radio on]

1259
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,739
So at least you know that
your sister's new boyfriend
isn't a waster.

1260
01:02:29,763 --> 01:02:31,722
If you're interested.

1261
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,637
[cell phone ringing]

1262
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:37,771
Yes?
[Laura] Hello?

1263
01:02:38,163 --> 01:02:39,163
Hello, Laura.
Alice?

1264
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,903
I can barely hear you.
Can you hear me?

1265
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:44,580
It's probably just a bad line.
I can hear you perfectly.

1266
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:45,884
Is something wrong?
[engine revs]

1267
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:49,151
I need a bit of diversion.
Take me shopping or something.

1268
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,300
No, yeah. Tomorrow's fine.
Brown Thomas, 10:00.
I have to go. Bye.

1269
01:02:52,786 --> 01:02:54,285
OK, perfect.
I'll meet you at...
[Martin]Heads up.

1270
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:55,829
That's a superb machine
you have there.

1271
01:02:57,661 --> 01:03:00,541
Listen, do you want to come
inside for a cup of tea?
I've got to head out.

1272
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:03,904
Alice is sippin' martinis,
readin' Hellomagazine.
Hectic life, don't you know.

1273
01:03:03,928 --> 01:03:05,472
She'd love to see you.
To be honest,
I have to go.

1274
01:03:05,496 --> 01:03:08,020
Take it easy,
but, hey, fabulous car.
Cheers.

1275
01:03:18,596 --> 01:03:20,032
This guy Adam,

1276
01:03:20,424 --> 01:03:22,817
he's Alice's
youngest sister's,
you know, boyfriend,

1277
01:03:23,252 --> 01:03:25,167
and he has this
classic car, right?

1278
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:26,821
Jerry, it's a Jaguar. OK?

1279
01:03:27,256 --> 01:03:28,475
Oh, nice car, the Jag.

1280
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:31,846
And what happened was,
this was 20 years ago, right?

1281
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,195
Both his parents
and his older sister...

1282
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:34,568
he told me this himself...

1283
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,266
all three of them were killed
in a car accident.

1284
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:38,790
You're kidding.

1285
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,986
Wait. In that very same car
that he's driving around today.

1286
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,317
He was at home
with the baby-sitter.

1287
01:03:44,665 --> 01:03:46,798
What was he doin' at home
with the baby-sitter?

1288
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:48,713
He wasn't doing anything.
He was three.

1289
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:52,418
No, he's just at home.
The rest...
[woman]Jerry...

1290
01:03:52,544 --> 01:03:54,957
The point is, he escaped.
The rest of them
are killed instantly.

1291
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:57,287
The thing is,
the car doesn't get dumped.

1292
01:03:57,636 --> 01:03:59,289
It just sat there for years.

1293
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:02,118
So by the time your man Adam
gets older, you know,

1294
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:05,121
it's startin' to sink into him
the significance of this wreck.

1295
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:07,273
Now he has somethin'
coming to him, you know,

1296
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:09,515
like a trust fund, inheritance,
that sort of thing.

1297
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:11,476
Do you know what he does,
this guy?

1298
01:04:11,867 --> 01:04:13,173
Spends it all.
No, no, no, no.

1299
01:04:13,608 --> 01:04:15,175
Of course
he spends it all...
at the pub.

1300
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:18,483
He uses... no.
He uses all of that money

1301
01:04:18,874 --> 01:04:20,274
to have the car
completely restored.

1302
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:22,008
He spends every penny on it.

1303
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,619
He even does some
of the restoration work himself.

1304
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:27,796
Yeah. And the restoration itself
is immaculate.

1305
01:04:28,188 --> 01:04:30,799
It's absolutely stunning,

1306
01:04:31,191 --> 01:04:35,849
and now he has
this beautiful,
beautiful thing,

1307
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,678
like an extraordinary memorial

1308
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:42,682
to his-his parents
and his sister, you know?

1309
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:44,379
It's beautiful,

1310
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,381
if you don't mind paying for it.

1311
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:49,123
No. I love paying for it.
That's my favorite part...

1312
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:51,952
and Martin's face
when he sees the Visa bill.

1313
01:04:52,387 --> 01:04:54,998
[Laura laughs]

1314
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,479
Yeah.

1315
01:04:57,871 --> 01:04:59,791
[woman over PA] Mr. Drummond
to Menswear, please.

1316
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:01,614
Mr. Drummond to Menswear.

1317
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:05,139
Sorry. Mrs. Rooney?
Thanks. Yes?

1318
01:05:05,574 --> 01:05:07,837
That is a seriously sexy number.

1319
01:05:08,229 --> 01:05:09,317
Hello. Sorry?

1320
01:05:10,971 --> 01:05:12,491
I mean it.
Even from where
I'm standing,

1321
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,430
I'm gettin' a bit of a turn-on.

1322
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,671
Who the hell are you?

1323
01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:18,632
Oh, sorry, Alice.
It's Adam.

1324
01:05:19,023 --> 01:05:20,023
Adam?

1325
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:22,549
Yeah, remember?

1326
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,551
Oh. Lucy's Adam?

1327
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:25,899
Yeah. How are ya?

1328
01:05:27,249 --> 01:05:28,649
Listen, sorry if
I gave you a scare,

1329
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,919
but I spotted you
in the distance,

1330
01:05:31,122 --> 01:05:32,210
and I thought, "Wow."

1331
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:33,762
In fact, I can still see you.

1332
01:05:34,169 --> 01:05:35,692
What?
Right now.

1333
01:05:36,127 --> 01:05:38,434
Where are you?
Stop messing.

1334
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:41,132
No. Look more carefully.

1335
01:05:41,568 --> 01:05:42,848
Yeah, you're gettin' warm.
Go on.

1336
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:45,742
But listen, Alice,
I really do mean it.

1337
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:47,581
I didn't realize
the night I met you

1338
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,751
just how fuckin' gorgeous
you are. Bye.

1339
01:05:51,142 --> 01:05:52,840
Adam, hold on.

1340
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,383
Laura!

1341
01:06:13,775 --> 01:06:16,386
Listen, I just saw Adam.
He's comin' down!

1342
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:19,302
Casual, for Jesus' sake.
The boy. Great.

1343
01:06:19,694 --> 01:06:21,934
Haven't seen him since the night
of the great first date.

1344
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:23,785
Not strictly a lie.

1345
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,787
Where is he?

1346
01:06:26,222 --> 01:06:28,703
Good.
Let's hope he's gone.

1347
01:06:29,138 --> 01:06:30,858
Oh, he'll be down.
Let's see what he thinks.

1348
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,750
I wonder has he any taste
in clothes?

1349
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,448
This is terrible.
We couldn't have
missed him, could we?

1350
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,840
Relax, Laura. He's probably
buying something first.

1351
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,830
No, no, no!
He pointed down,
like he was...

1352
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:41,705
What's going on?
She's nervier than I am.

1353
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:44,173
Of course she always was
the tense, hysterical one
of the family,

1354
01:06:44,197 --> 01:06:45,197
but, oh, for God's sake.

1355
01:06:45,503 --> 01:06:46,939
[whimpering]

1356
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:51,683
Hold on now.
I think our Laura
is up to something.

1357
01:06:52,118 --> 01:06:54,904
So, when you and Adam
do meet up,

1358
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:56,949
what do you talk about?

1359
01:06:57,341 --> 01:07:00,910
Hmm? Oh, nothing, you know.
We just talk. Why?

1360
01:07:01,345 --> 01:07:04,043
My sick mind.
Don't worry about it.

1361
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,263
What? Worry about what?

1362
01:07:06,698 --> 01:07:07,917
Nothing, Laura.
You know me.

1363
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:11,436
I just wondered whether...
I don't know, you know...

1364
01:07:11,616 --> 01:07:13,072
I mean, if he talked
about personal stuff.

1365
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:14,793
You know, intimate.
Oh, come on, Laura.

1366
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:18,710
Let's say... stuff
about your looks
or sexy talk.

1367
01:07:19,145 --> 01:07:20,145
No. No, nothing.

1368
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,540
Really! Not everything
has to be seedy

1369
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,673
and cynical and all that.

1370
01:07:25,064 --> 01:07:26,675
I think that Adam
has some deep tragedy

1371
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:28,852
lurking underneath the surface.

1372
01:07:29,287 --> 01:07:30,854
Oh, right.
I didn't spot that one.

1373
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:32,889
But then, of course,
I've hardly met him.

1374
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:34,971
I mean, you obviously
know him much better.

1375
01:07:35,293 --> 01:07:37,034
No, no. I don't, but...
Oh, my God.

1376
01:07:37,425 --> 01:07:38,688
What... Adam?
No, it's Simon.

1377
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:40,079
Well, who's Simon?

1378
01:07:41,386 --> 01:07:43,226
Lucy's ex. He's a, you know,
stand-up comedian.

1379
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:46,043
Isn't that strange?
Just as we were talking
about... Hello.

1380
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:48,394
[Simon]Oh, hello,
uh, it's, uh...
This is Lucy's...

1381
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:50,482
Sister. Laura.
Laura.

1382
01:07:50,874 --> 01:07:52,179
Lu, I'm asking you.

1383
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:55,855
Sisters are supposed
to confide in each other
about these things.

1384
01:07:55,879 --> 01:07:56,923
Oh, I don't know yet.

1385
01:07:57,358 --> 01:07:59,186
Anyway, you mind
your own business.

1386
01:07:59,578 --> 01:08:01,841
Absolutely.

1387
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:03,234
So, you comin' in?

1388
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,025
He's hanging
a new exhibition today.

1389
01:08:05,149 --> 01:08:06,149
He'd love you to see it.

1390
01:08:07,238 --> 01:08:09,066
No. I'll leave you to it.
Catch you later.

1391
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:13,288
Alice.

1392
01:08:13,767 --> 01:08:16,204
Um... you know,
like, the way

1393
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:18,903
fellas always hassle about sex?

1394
01:08:19,294 --> 01:08:20,426
I vaguely remember.

1395
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:21,993
Well, Adam doesn't.

1396
01:08:22,428 --> 01:08:25,692
He seems really happy
to leave it up to me.

1397
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:28,651
It's kind of nice for a change.

1398
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:30,653
Oh, no.

1399
01:08:31,045 --> 01:08:32,917
Are you fallin' in love,
sparrow?

1400
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:36,442
See you.

1401
01:09:01,947 --> 01:09:05,994
You're pushing the boat
out a bit tonight.

1402
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:08,749
It's only one of Peggy's
impromptu piss-ups,
for God's sake.

1403
01:09:08,823 --> 01:09:11,130
[Peggy] The eyesight went,
the hair, the teeth

1404
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:12,958
The hearing not too great

1405
01:09:13,393 --> 01:09:14,393
I'd run...

1406
01:09:15,525 --> 01:09:17,045
I don't know.
I just didn't bring Karen

1407
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,920
because of Mum's
sing-along, you know?

1408
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,500
I really don't think
it'd be her sort of thing.

1409
01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:23,814
Hey, hey, David. Feck off
like a good young fella.

1410
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:24,404
What?

1411
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:25,927
Feck off.

1412
01:09:27,624 --> 01:09:31,367
So, remember what
we talked about
the other day?

1413
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:34,327
Oh, so it happened?
At last. And?

1414
01:09:34,718 --> 01:09:36,677
Gorgeous. I mean...

1415
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:39,246
[Peggy]Lucy! Lucy!
An open call.

1416
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:41,074
You go on.
I'll do this.

1417
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:42,684
My baby girl Lucy.

1418
01:09:43,076 --> 01:09:44,686
Come on.
I'll join in with you.

1419
01:09:45,078 --> 01:09:46,358
Remember, control
your diaphragm.

1420
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:50,300
[laughter/applause]

1421
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:52,128
So, how's the boy?

1422
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,763
Have you had enough of us yet?

1423
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,567
No, no. It's great.
I love your family.

1424
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,831
Don't you sing at all?
Not a note.

1425
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:00,833
You're all so different,
aren't you?

1426
01:10:01,268 --> 01:10:02,356
Only in some ways.

1427
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:04,097
[pours wine]

1428
01:10:04,532 --> 01:10:05,663
Thanks.

1429
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:07,274
Well, you're the sexiest.

1430
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:10,320
Am I?
Oh, yeah. No question.

1431
01:10:12,105 --> 01:10:13,545
I still love that outfit,
by the way.

1432
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:15,195
I'm glad you bought it.

1433
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,499
Why didn't you
come over and talk to me
that day in Brown Thomas?

1434
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,177
Would you
have liked me to?
Of course. Why not?

1435
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:23,726
So do you want to
get to know me better?

1436
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:25,380
Yes.

1437
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:26,860
I'd love...

1438
01:10:29,036 --> 01:10:32,039
What I'd love to do right now...

1439
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:34,345
is touch you.

1440
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:39,524
You're so sexy, really.

1441
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:41,831
What about Friday evening?
Let's meet.

1442
01:10:42,223 --> 01:10:43,354
Oh, no. Not Friday.

1443
01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:46,053
I've got to go to a do
with Martin.

1444
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,885
Let me baby-sit
for yourself, on Friday.

1445
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:53,887
I love kids.

1446
01:10:54,278 --> 01:10:57,238
I'll come around to your house,
and I'll baby-sit for you.

1447
01:10:57,629 --> 01:11:00,937
And I'll be there
when you come back.

1448
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,547
What do you say?

1449
01:11:02,983 --> 01:11:04,941
Yeah. OK.

1450
01:11:05,376 --> 01:11:06,944
Will Lucy know
what you're doing?

1451
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:08,815
Of course. I'll tell her.

1452
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:11,470
She's workin'
on Friday night,
so she won't mind.

1453
01:11:11,906 --> 01:11:13,951
Knowin' Lucy, she'll think
it's great idea.

1454
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:17,128
She wants me to get on well
with all the family.

1455
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:20,958
Oh, that young fellow
is a lovely drunk.

1456
01:11:21,393 --> 01:11:22,394
Did you know that?

1457
01:11:23,526 --> 01:11:25,615
Uhh!

1458
01:11:26,007 --> 01:11:28,096
[horn blasts]

1459
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:33,057
Uh, we're home? Huh?

1460
01:11:33,492 --> 01:11:35,103
Let me just...

1461
01:11:35,494 --> 01:11:37,540
Hi, Adam. Can you give me
a hand here, please?

1462
01:11:37,975 --> 01:11:39,672
Sure.
From the buckle belt.

1463
01:11:40,064 --> 01:11:41,674
And why don't you hit the sack?

1464
01:11:42,066 --> 01:11:44,155
And myself and Adam
will just go downstairs,

1465
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,201
have a couple, bit of a chat?

1466
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,316
Oh, no. Nothin'
for me, Martin.
I'm drivin'.

1467
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:52,077
I know you are, you and that
fantastic car of yours.

1468
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:55,863
You're one lucky horse
to have a car like that.

1469
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:58,040
Fairly easy to keep it
in immacul...

1470
01:11:58,475 --> 01:11:59,519
immaculate cond...

1471
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:02,629
I wouldn't drink, either,
if I had a car like that.

1472
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:05,830
Do you know why?
Do you know...

1473
01:12:11,314 --> 01:12:14,230
Well, it's the spare room
for me tonight, thank Christ.

1474
01:12:14,665 --> 01:12:16,406
[Martin snoring]

1475
01:12:22,716 --> 01:12:25,937
[whispers]
She wasn't out.

1476
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:28,679
Good party?

1477
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:32,291
No.

1478
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:35,208
Dear me.
Fancy a coffee?

1479
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,732
[chuckles]Yeah.

1480
01:12:38,168 --> 01:12:40,779
[Martin snores]

1481
01:12:41,171 --> 01:12:42,781
[switches intercom off]

1482
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:08,372
No.

1483
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:10,026
Yes.

1484
01:13:13,464 --> 01:13:16,075
I said no. I'm sorry.

1485
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:19,340
It's not that I don't think
it'd be very nice.

1486
01:13:19,732 --> 01:13:21,386
Nice and firm and...

1487
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:23,741
I know I gave you
the impression I was on for it.

1488
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:26,347
I was. I am, actually.
It's just...

1489
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:28,175
It's all right.

1490
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:31,483
I don't need to know why,
but, uh... are you sure?

1491
01:13:31,918 --> 01:13:34,051
Yes or no?

1492
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:36,749
[Martin snoring]

1493
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:39,273

[baby cooing]

1495
01:13:45,627 --> 01:13:46,628
Yes.

1496
01:13:47,064 --> 01:13:49,066
Yeah?
As in, I'm sure.

1497
01:13:49,457 --> 01:13:50,850
Fine.

1498
01:13:55,115 --> 01:13:56,160
Well, then.

1499
01:13:56,595 --> 01:13:57,944
[laughs]

1500
01:13:58,336 --> 01:13:59,616
Would you still like
your coffee?

1501
01:13:59,946 --> 01:14:03,429
Uh, yeah.
Sure, why not?

1502
01:14:03,864 --> 01:14:04,864
[cell phone ringing]

1503
01:14:05,126 --> 01:14:06,258
OK.

1504
01:14:11,176 --> 01:14:13,439
Hello?
[Lucy] Hello!
Adam gone yet?

1505
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,093
He's still here.
Great.

1506
01:14:15,441 --> 01:14:20,228
Hold on.
Adam? Lucy. For you.

1507
01:14:23,231 --> 01:14:24,798
Hey, Lucy.

1508
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,974
So, Adam...

1509
01:14:27,366 --> 01:14:28,976
I'm asking you now.

1510
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:30,586
Will you marry me?

1511
01:14:30,978 --> 01:14:33,807
[David]Jesus Christ.

1512
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:35,461
I'd love to.

1513
01:14:35,852 --> 01:14:39,160
[cheers and applause]

1514
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:42,685
[Karen]That's the most
romantic thing I've ever seen.

1515
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:44,644
[man]Go on!

1516
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,822
Unbelievable!
Isn't it?

1517
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:52,261
Yes, Mummy.
Completely unbelievable.

1518
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:54,611
[laughing]

1519
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,703
[sobbing]

1520
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:07,624
[Peggy]These feathers.
Look at them.

1521
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,322
Look at all the feathers.

1522
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:11,933
[blowing]

1523
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:14,327
Oh, Jeanie.

1524
01:15:14,762 --> 01:15:16,851
Why can't you
always stay that way?

1525
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:19,158
You'd be better off.

1526
01:15:19,593 --> 01:15:21,725
Now it's all ahead of you.

1527
01:15:22,161 --> 01:15:25,773
You'll grow up,
and you'll be beautiful.

1528
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,818
Fellas will come
sniffing around,

1529
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,821
and sooner or later, of course,

1530
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,672
some fucking idiot
will lurch over to you
with that look in his eye,

1531
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,002
and he'll say, "Do you know
what you need, love?

1532
01:15:37,351 --> 01:15:40,397
What you need
is a good shag."

1533
01:15:40,789 --> 01:15:43,357
Oh, it will happen.
Believe me.

1534
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,620
But, Jean...

1535
01:15:46,055 --> 01:15:49,711
you know what the really
annoying thing is?

1536
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,192
It might be true.

1537
01:15:52,627 --> 01:15:56,457
When you wish for

1538
01:15:56,892 --> 01:16:01,026
The kind of day

1539
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:05,553
That feels

1540
01:16:05,988 --> 01:16:09,948
The way you feel

1541
01:16:11,254 --> 01:16:14,432
Sunshine

1542
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:15,867
Makes every...

01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:19,002
[line ringing]

1544
01:16:19,394 --> 01:16:21,222
[Adam] Hello?

1545
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:23,920
Hello?

1546
01:16:24,312 --> 01:16:25,400
Hello?
[Alice hangs up]

1547
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:28,968
Mum? There's something
I forgot to do.

1548
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,102
You'll be all right with Jean
for an hour, won't you?

1549
01:16:32,537 --> 01:16:37,542
And rainy days

1550
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:39,283
You see

1551
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:40,718
Oh, God!

1552
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:45,071
Love can also be that way

1553
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,639
[Laura laughing]

1554
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:49,859
You'll get your wish

1555
01:16:50,294 --> 01:16:53,863
But it's not free

1556
01:16:54,298 --> 01:16:55,734
[bottle clinks]

1557
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:58,260
[gasps]

1558
01:16:59,522 --> 01:17:01,741
Please.

1559
01:17:02,133 --> 01:17:03,133
Don't.

1560
01:17:03,961 --> 01:17:04,961
[Laura]What's the matter?

1561
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:08,618
Huh? Oh, nothing.

1562
01:17:09,053 --> 01:17:10,620
It's just I was thinking that...

1563
01:17:11,055 --> 01:17:14,276
life is exhilarating, isn't it?

1564
01:17:14,711 --> 01:17:16,800
Oh, absolutely!

1565
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:22,458
[sighs/chuckles]

1566
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:28,159
Ah. You've not going
walking in that outfit?

1567
01:17:28,507 --> 01:17:30,596
Hey, Lucy!
Would you not
come with us?

1568
01:17:30,988 --> 01:17:32,119
I said no!

1569
01:17:33,556 --> 01:17:34,968
But there's loads of things
we could be sorting out.

1570
01:17:34,992 --> 01:17:36,950
I know, Mum. That's why
I'm not coming.

1571
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:38,996
I'm tired and sick
of invitation lists

1572
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,509
and menus and dress fittings

1573
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,502
and endless, endless talk
about the wedding!

1574
01:17:44,132 --> 01:17:45,972
I just want an afternoon
to do what I like, OK?

1575
01:17:46,352 --> 01:17:50,138
OK?! Jesus!

1576
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:51,749
[door slams]

1577
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:53,794
What's eating her?

1578
01:17:54,186 --> 01:17:56,667
Leave her, Mum.
Come on.

1579
01:17:57,058 --> 01:17:59,496
If you came with me
even once a month,

1580
01:17:59,887 --> 01:18:01,802
it'd do you no end of good.

1581
01:18:02,194 --> 01:18:03,978
It wards off
all the evil spirits,

1582
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,894
I'm telling you.

1583
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:10,550
Oh, and just look at that view.

1584
01:18:11,029 --> 01:18:12,509
Isn't Dublin huge?

1585
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,206
You knew that already.

1586
01:18:14,598 --> 01:18:17,427
But to see it, though,
all laid out on a plate.

1587
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:19,646
Yeah, I know.

1588
01:18:20,038 --> 01:18:22,040
Come on.

1589
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:24,130
[inhales]

1590
01:18:24,522 --> 01:18:26,001
[exhales]

1591
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,009
Mum?
Mm-hmm?

1592
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:35,489
Tell me the truth.

1593
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:37,491
You never liked Martin, did you?

1594
01:18:37,883 --> 01:18:40,625
Ah...
Mum, please.

1595
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:44,803
Do you mean since years ago?

1596
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:47,414
I mean since you first met him.

1597
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:50,765
Well... no.

1598
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,202
I suppose... no.

1599
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:54,943
[laughs]

1600
01:18:55,379 --> 01:18:56,815
Well, why didn't you
say something?

1601
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,250
You know, then?

1602
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:00,815
I didn't want to be
sticking my oar in.

1603
01:19:01,472 --> 01:19:02,753
But you knew.
You saw right through him.

1604
01:19:02,777 --> 01:19:05,301
You knew he was
a total fucking idiot.

1605
01:19:05,693 --> 01:19:07,217
Ohh, it doesn't matter.

1606
01:19:07,566 --> 01:19:09,263
I just wondered, I suppose.

1607
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:12,832
If I'd interfered,
I'd have been the worst
in the world.

1608
01:19:13,267 --> 01:19:15,107
You'd have married him anyway
just to spite me.

1609
01:19:15,312 --> 01:19:17,532
Tsk. Yeah, I know.

1610
01:19:17,967 --> 01:19:19,621
[sighs]
And what about Adam?

1611
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:22,711
Adam? Oh, a different
kettle of fish altogether.

1612
01:19:23,103 --> 01:19:24,103
I'm delighted there.

1613
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:26,705
The way he seems
to fit in with everyone.

1614
01:19:26,889 --> 01:19:27,889
So good to Lucy.

1615
01:19:28,282 --> 01:19:29,849
Himself and Laura
are great pals.

1616
01:19:30,284 --> 01:19:32,025
David worships
the ground he walks on.

1617
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,244
Oh, he's brightened up
the whole house.
Yeah.

1618
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,551
Oh, don't tell me
you don't like him.

1619
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:39,336
Oh, me like Adam?
I do, yeah. Definitely.

1620
01:19:39,728 --> 01:19:41,426
So what are you going on about?

1621
01:19:41,817 --> 01:19:43,340
Well, I suppose I feel...

1622
01:19:43,776 --> 01:19:45,995
don't you think there's
lots about Adam we don't know?

1623
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,551
You're worried there might be
some surprises for Lucy?

1624
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:50,043
Yeah, I suppose.

1625
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:53,110
Ah, well,
the way I see things
these days, chicken,

1626
01:19:53,134 --> 01:19:54,701
boring men are
the curse of the world,

1627
01:19:55,136 --> 01:19:56,703
and there's
just so many of them,

1628
01:19:57,138 --> 01:19:58,705
so if a girl
can avoid them at all,

1629
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,707
she's definitely
in with the chance.

1630
01:20:01,142 --> 01:20:02,317
Come on.

1631
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:08,454
So tell us...
where's the honeymoon?

1632
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:10,804
Somewhere exotic?
It's a secret, Andy.

1633
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,328
Shouldn't we start
getting the dress on, Mum?

1634
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,809
No! Wait till
the last minute.
Oh, thanks, love.

1635
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,804
Otherwise, you'll just be
standing about for ages,
afraid to move.

1636
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,205
But what if
something goes wrong?
What if it doesn't fit?

1637
01:20:21,597 --> 01:20:23,381
You had it on last night.
It was perfect.

1638
01:20:23,817 --> 01:20:25,601
Oh, no,
I couldn't, Alice. Thanks.

1639
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:27,473
[Andy]Lucy, calm down.
You'll be fine.

1640
01:20:28,822 --> 01:20:30,542
[Peggy]And you know
you look gorgeous in it.

1641
01:20:30,824 --> 01:20:33,435
So, I believe congratulations
are in order.

1642
01:20:33,827 --> 01:20:35,090
Oh, yeah!

1643
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:37,325
Professor McCormick
only told me unofficially,

1644
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:39,486
but it looks like
first-class honors.

1645
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:41,488
Oh.
Do you want to read it?

1646
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:43,098
What do you think?

1647
01:20:44,795 --> 01:20:46,164
[laughs]No, really.
It's all about women and sex.

1648
01:20:46,188 --> 01:20:47,798
There's a copy over there.

1649
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:51,410
As MA theses go,
it's a rattling good read.

1650
01:20:51,802 --> 01:20:54,042
No. Think I'll wait
for the film.
[Lucy]What do you think?

1651
01:20:54,196 --> 01:20:56,111
Oh, it's beautiful, Lucy, love.

1652
01:20:56,546 --> 01:20:57,895
Well done, Andy!

1653
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,985
David, there you are.
You ready, pet?

1654
01:21:01,377 --> 01:21:03,257
[David]Will you go through
my checklist with me?

1655
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,380
What do you think?

1656
01:21:04,815 --> 01:21:05,815
Gorgeous!

1657
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:08,166
What time is he expecting you?

1658
01:21:08,558 --> 01:21:10,318
[David]About an hour.
We want to make sure...

1659
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:12,214
I went through it all upstairs.

1660
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:14,521
Don't touch it.
[squeals]

1661
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:17,915
Right. I'm off.

1662
01:21:18,308 --> 01:21:20,876
Alice. Alice, um...

1663
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:23,139
You'll be fine.

1664
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:29,448
Bye.

1665
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:30,712
[knock on door]

1666
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,530
Better not let anybody
see you like that.

1667
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:36,413
Simon.

1668
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,894
Hello. I've just got
a present for Lucy.

1669
01:21:39,285 --> 01:21:41,026
Oh, thanks very much.
I'll give it to her.

1670
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:44,377
Maybe I could say hello
or wish her Godspeed?

1671
01:21:44,726 --> 01:21:46,423
She's up to her eyes
at the minute, Simon.

1672
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:47,931
Only a couple of hours to go.

1673
01:21:49,078 --> 01:21:50,621
Honestly, if I could
see her for a moment...

1674
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:52,168
No, Simon, but thanks
for the present.

1675
01:21:52,603 --> 01:21:53,603
Bye.

1676
01:21:57,434 --> 01:22:01,831
Oh, God. I've done
a terrible thing.

1677
01:22:05,225 --> 01:22:06,226
Laura?

1678
01:22:06,618 --> 01:22:08,272
Laura, can I see you
for a minute?

1679
01:22:08,664 --> 01:22:11,144
No, not you, Mummy.
Everything's fine.
Stay where you are.

1680
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,711
You slept with Simon?

1681
01:22:13,059 --> 01:22:15,496
I bumped into him
at the swimming pool.

1682
01:22:15,888 --> 01:22:17,498
I was in a funny mood.

1683
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:20,652
I panicked, I suppose,
thinking I'm throwing
my freedom away. Jesus!

1684
01:22:20,676 --> 01:22:22,112
[both]Mind your hair!

1685
01:22:23,809 --> 01:22:25,526
Look, everybody
does something like that
before they get married.

1686
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,117
You'd be mad not to.
Aren't I right?

1687
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:31,548
No, I shouldn't have!
It didn't matter.
It was only that one time.

1688
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:33,534
But now I can't face
Adam in the church!
I have to tell him.

1689
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:35,952
Oh, Jesus!
Now, listen...
Now, listen, Luce.

1690
01:22:36,387 --> 01:22:37,954
Do you want
to marry Adam?
Yes.

1691
01:22:38,389 --> 01:22:40,629
You want to spend the rest
of your life with him?
Oh, yes!

1692
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:42,132
Not with Simon?
No! No way.

1693
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:44,327
Well, then, say nothing.
Not today, not ever.

1694
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,789
But that's not fair.

1695
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:47,791
Will it make anyone any happier?

1696
01:22:48,226 --> 01:22:50,184
Will it mean
it never happened?
No.

1697
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,186
Well, then, do you hear me now?

1698
01:22:52,622 --> 01:22:54,536
She's right, Luce.

1699
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:55,928
Yeah.

1700
01:22:56,321 --> 01:22:58,584
Yeah, I suppose.

1701
01:22:58,976 --> 01:23:00,586
OK, I'll forget about it.

1702
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:02,414
[all laughing]

1703
01:23:02,806 --> 01:23:04,198
Thank you.

1704
01:23:05,896 --> 01:23:07,438
We'd better go
before Mum's curiosity
gets the better of her.

1705
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:08,681
Are you OK?

1706
01:23:09,116 --> 01:23:10,291
Yeah.

1707
01:23:11,684 --> 01:23:14,992
So, was it any fun, by the way?

1708
01:23:15,427 --> 01:23:16,427
What, Simon?

1709
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:17,602
Yeah.

1710
01:23:17,908 --> 01:23:21,041
Not bad, actually.

1711
01:23:21,476 --> 01:23:25,350
Good. Worth
your while, huh?

1712
01:23:28,396 --> 01:23:29,703
Well, hello.

1713
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,532
So you're gonna
go ahead and do it?

1714
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:35,535
Yeah, of course.

1715
01:23:35,883 --> 01:23:37,842
Come in.

1716
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:44,675
You're looking gorgeous.

1717
01:23:45,023 --> 01:23:46,677
Do you think so?
Really?

1718
01:23:47,025 --> 01:23:48,156
I always think so,

1719
01:23:48,548 --> 01:23:51,594
but that's especially gorgeous.

1720
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:54,162
Do you like these?
They were my dad's.

1721
01:23:54,554 --> 01:23:56,861
Is there a story
behind those, too?

1722
01:23:57,296 --> 01:24:01,692
So, you're still
sleeping with Laura.

1723
01:24:02,127 --> 01:24:04,433
I suppose you'd still
sleep with me.

1724
01:24:04,825 --> 01:24:05,825
Would you?

1725
01:24:06,044 --> 01:24:08,307
Absolutely.
If you wanted.

1726
01:24:08,742 --> 01:24:09,742
[laughs]

1727
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:13,356
I mean, why do you do it, Adam?

1728
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,881
Well, I don't know.

1729
01:24:16,272 --> 01:24:17,578
I definitely don't do it

1730
01:24:17,926 --> 01:24:19,885
because I think
someone's fucked up my life

1731
01:24:20,276 --> 01:24:21,316
and I want to get revenge.

1732
01:24:21,713 --> 01:24:23,889
That would be no good, Alice.

1733
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,978
Maybe...

1734
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:27,980
Would you believe me
if I told you

1735
01:24:28,415 --> 01:24:30,504
that when I'm with people,
listening to them,

1736
01:24:30,896 --> 01:24:33,202
I notice that they always
want something from me.

1737
01:24:33,594 --> 01:24:35,161
Oh, I'd believe that, all right.

1738
01:24:35,596 --> 01:24:37,903
And it doesn't annoy me.
I really like it.

1739
01:24:38,338 --> 01:24:42,908
I like to give people
what they want, if I can.

1740
01:24:43,343 --> 01:24:44,387
Whatever makes them happy.

1741
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:47,434
It's a very easy thing
for me to do.

1742
01:24:47,869 --> 01:24:49,566
Sinful, even.

1743
01:24:49,915 --> 01:24:52,831
Maybe.

1744
01:24:53,266 --> 01:24:54,571
Do you believe me?

1745
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,837
The thing is, I'd like to.

1746
01:24:58,272 --> 01:25:00,013
Would it make me happy?

1747
01:25:00,448 --> 01:25:03,233
We've about
half an hour to spare
if you want to find out.

1748
01:25:11,894 --> 01:25:13,461
Do you want me?

1749
01:25:13,853 --> 01:25:15,942
[moaning]

1750
01:25:25,038 --> 01:25:27,867

[sighs]

1752
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:42,665
Life... is exhilarating,
isn't it?

[door buzzer]

1754
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,235
Oh, Jesus. David.

1755
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:49,063
Probably.

1756
01:25:51,848 --> 01:25:52,848
Hello?

1757
01:25:54,198 --> 01:25:55,638
[David] How are you, Adam?
Guess who.

1758
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:57,019
Hi, Davey.
So are you ready?

1759
01:25:57,332 --> 01:25:58,452
No, of course I'm not ready.

1760
01:25:58,637 --> 01:26:00,204
I was interrupted.
Come on up.

1761
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,990
Jesus! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

1762
01:26:03,381 --> 01:26:06,167
What have I done?
What am I after doing?

1763
01:26:06,602 --> 01:26:07,951
[knock on door]

1764
01:26:09,823 --> 01:26:11,409
[David]Come on, sis.
You're holding up
the whole show.

1765
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:12,433
Who's that?
David, is it?

1766
01:26:12,782 --> 01:26:13,957
Who do you think?

1767
01:26:14,349 --> 01:26:16,742
Come out and tell us
how we look.

1768
01:26:17,134 --> 01:26:19,484
Right. Sure, yeah.

1769
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,497
Poor old Martin.

1770
01:26:34,718 --> 01:26:36,633
[sighs]

1771
01:26:42,204 --> 01:26:43,858
Well?

1772
01:26:44,293 --> 01:26:47,426
You both look very sexy.

1773
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:49,385
Yeah, we're rides, we are.

1774
01:26:49,776 --> 01:26:52,301
And, Alice, Adam was telling me
why you're here.

1775
01:26:52,736 --> 01:26:55,173
That was a really nice thing
to think of.

1776
01:26:55,565 --> 01:26:57,565
You're just a big softie
behind it all, aren't you?

1777
01:26:57,915 --> 01:26:59,874
Ah, you don't know
your sister, Davey.

1778
01:27:00,265 --> 01:27:02,224
So, what do you think
of your present?

1779
01:27:02,615 --> 01:27:04,879
They suit you very well.

1780
01:27:05,314 --> 01:27:06,445
I'm delighted.

1781
01:27:06,881 --> 01:27:08,579
Listen, I'll go.

1782
01:27:08,971 --> 01:27:10,842
Right. Davey,
are we organized?

1783
01:27:13,018 --> 01:27:15,238
I'll see you in church.

1784
01:27:19,807 --> 01:27:21,635
[ organ]

1785
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:23,594
[man]Monica, you look fantastic.

1786
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:27,990
Nice to see you.
You look gorgeous.

1787
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:29,513
I'll see you.
OK.

1788
01:27:29,948 --> 01:27:32,211
[indistinct]
You didn't.

1789
01:27:35,475 --> 01:27:36,824
Martin.
Yeah?

1790
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,826
Be a good man
and hold little Jean

1791
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:41,307
at the back here in case
she acts up, will you?
OK.

1792
01:27:41,742 --> 01:27:43,831
Now, love,
Daddy's gonna mind you.

1793
01:27:49,968 --> 01:27:52,580
Excuse me. I hope
I'm at the right wedding.

1794
01:27:52,972 --> 01:27:54,539
I'm looking for a Laura Owens.

1795
01:27:54,974 --> 01:27:57,672
Oh, yes. Laura's my sister.
I'm Alice. And you are?

1796
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:59,152
Oh, Harry McCormick.

1797
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:01,914
I'm Laura's supervisor,
you know, her thesis.

1798
01:28:01,938 --> 01:28:03,504
She asked me here today
as her guest.

1799
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,464
Oh, right. Well,
she's up here. Come on.

1800
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:08,945
So, Harry,
good thesis, I believe.

1801
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:13,601
I don't mind saying
it's extraordinary, electric.

1802
01:28:13,993 --> 01:28:15,873
Normally, theses are rather
dull things to read.

1803
01:28:16,169 --> 01:28:17,562
This is something else.
Here we go.

1804
01:28:17,997 --> 01:28:21,479
Laura, your supervisor.
Slip in there, Harry.

1805
01:28:23,785 --> 01:28:24,830
Hi.

1806
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:26,832
I reread chapter four
last night.

1807
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:28,486
Oh, Harry.

1808
01:28:32,794 --> 01:28:35,407
[ Mendelssohn's "Wedding March"]

1809
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:38,497
[shushing]

1810
01:28:41,021 --> 01:28:42,849
Look at Auntie Lucy.

1811
01:28:43,197 --> 01:28:44,982
Oh, God, Jean, look.

1812
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:46,330
[crowd murmuring]

1813
01:28:46,418 --> 01:28:47,985
See? Lovely.

1814
01:28:53,947 --> 01:28:56,384
[man]Beautiful dress.
Oh, my goodness.

1815
01:28:56,819 --> 01:28:59,953
Beautiful.

1816
01:29:00,345 --> 01:29:02,521
That dress...
Oh, she's beautiful.

1817
01:29:02,912 --> 01:29:05,176
You're beautiful.

1818
01:29:17,971 --> 01:29:19,234
[Lucy whispers]Oh, God.

1819
01:29:22,759 --> 01:29:25,023
I can't. I'm sorry, Mum.

1820
01:29:25,371 --> 01:29:27,112
[Alice]
What's she doing?

1821
01:29:27,547 --> 01:29:29,114
What's the matter?

1822
01:29:29,549 --> 01:29:31,768
Adam, you really
want to marry Lucy?

1823
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,379
Yeah.
You're sure?

1824
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,033
With all that means?

1825
01:29:35,511 --> 01:29:37,644
Yeah.

1826
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:40,342
Good. Go for it,
handsome.

1827
01:29:41,735 --> 01:29:43,824
[Adam]Lucy! Lucy!

1828
01:29:44,216 --> 01:29:45,391
It's all right.

1829
01:29:45,826 --> 01:29:47,306
Look, if you've
changed your mind

1830
01:29:47,741 --> 01:29:49,181
or if you can't face it,
don't worry.

1831
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:50,918
No, no, it's not that.
Really, it's not.

1832
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,963
There's nothing
I want more, Adam.

1833
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:56,054
But I can't. I can't.

1834
01:29:56,445 --> 01:29:57,814
Adam, there's something
I have to tell you.

1835
01:29:57,838 --> 01:29:59,278
Something I did.
I can't marry you...

1836
01:29:59,405 --> 01:30:01,320
Hold on, Lucy, hold on.
Shh. Shh.
What?

1837
01:30:01,755 --> 01:30:03,316
Don't feel you have
to tell me anything.

1838
01:30:03,627 --> 01:30:05,412
But I want to have
no secrets between us.

1839
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:07,501
Why not?

1840
01:30:07,936 --> 01:30:10,591
Because I want you to trust me.

1841
01:30:11,026 --> 01:30:13,072
But I do trust you.

1842
01:30:13,463 --> 01:30:15,465
Why should I expect you
to tell me everything?

1843
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:19,208
I trust you,
but that shouldn't mean...

1844
01:30:19,643 --> 01:30:21,558
We all need
to have secrets, Lucy.

1845
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,257
I'm not gonna tell you mine.

1846
01:30:24,648 --> 01:30:26,781
So you keep secrets
from me, too?

1847
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:30,089
Yeah, of course.
You'd be shocked.

1848
01:30:30,437 --> 01:30:31,699
[laughs]What?

1849
01:30:32,134 --> 01:30:33,309
Fellas.

1850
01:30:35,006 --> 01:30:36,767
You love people to think
you're all mysterious
and interesting.

1851
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:41,056
Yeah, well, I am.
I swear.

1852
01:30:41,448 --> 01:30:43,102
Aw, look here,
forget the wedding.

1853
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:45,104
Why don't we
just jump in the car

1854
01:30:45,452 --> 01:30:47,107
and drive away out of this?

1855
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:50,284
That? That's not...
What happened to the Jag?

1856
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,460
Oh, well, I suppose
I thought the Jag

1857
01:30:52,895 --> 01:30:55,289
had a lot of old
history behind it,
a lot of baggage,

1858
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,508
so I traded it in yesterday.

1859
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,120
I thought, you know,
maybe a family car

1860
01:31:00,468 --> 01:31:02,557
might be a bit more suitable.

1861
01:31:02,948 --> 01:31:03,948
Right.

1862
01:31:04,036 --> 01:31:05,036
You don't mind, do you?

1863
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:08,128
No. No. It's just, um...

1864
01:31:08,476 --> 01:31:09,651
Yeah?
Yeah.

1865
01:31:10,086 --> 01:31:12,132
It's the Jag
was more... you.

1866
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:16,136

1867
01:31:16,484 --> 01:31:17,484
Look.

01:31:22,229 --> 01:31:23,665
I love you.

1870
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,668
Will you marry me?

Secrets and all.

1872
01:31:29,236 --> 01:31:33,328
Go on, sure, take a chance.

1873
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:35,460
Make a new start.

1874
01:31:37,549 --> 01:31:38,724
Yes.

1875
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,770
Thank God for that.

1876
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,381
Can we get on with it now?

There were never
such devoted sisters

Never had to have
a chaperone, no, sir

1882
01:32:31,387 --> 01:32:34,999
I'm here to keep my eye on her

that we are wearing

When a certain gentleman
arrived from Rome

1887
01:32:47,925 --> 01:32:51,276
She wore the dress,
and I stayed home

we stick together

1889
01:32:55,585 --> 01:32:59,242

Two different faces,
but in tight places

We think and we act as one

1893
01:33:09,774 --> 01:33:11,471
Seen us

Know that not a thing
could come between us

1895
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:18,391
Many men have tried
to split us up

1896

01:33:41,023 --> 01:33:42,460
Those who've

1902
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:43,851
Seen us

1903
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:45,375
And plenty have seen us

1904
01:33:46,507 --> 01:33:47,876
Know that not a thing
could come between us

1905
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:48,900
Go, girl, go

1906
01:33:50,206 --> 01:33:51,526
Many men have tried
to split us up

1907
01:33:51,904 --> 01:33:55,299
But no one can

1908
01:33:57,475 --> 01:34:01,043
Lord help the mister

1909
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:05,178
Who comes between me
and my sister

1910
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:09,400
And lord help the sister

1911
01:34:09,835 --> 01:34:14,013
Who comes between me and my man

1912
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:20,454
Sisters

1913
01:34:20,846 --> 01:34:23,675
Ever-loving sisters

1914
01:34:26,461 --> 01:34:33,381
But don't come between
me and my man
