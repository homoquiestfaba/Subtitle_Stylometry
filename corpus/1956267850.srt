1
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,039
- Yes?
- Ready?

2
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:28,640
Let me talk to Michael.

3
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:31,276
- Let me know he's okay.
- Trust me, he's all right.

4
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,722
But your little boy's dead
if you're not ready.

5
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:36,321
If you really kidnapped my son
then let me hear his voice.

6
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:39,001
I've done everything you've said.
I haven't left the house,

7
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:40,196
I haven't made any calls.

8
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,561
We know...
Read the paper?

9
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,446
The paper?
No, I haven't read the paper.

10
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,235
Let me fix that.

11
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:04,355
Oh, God!

12
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,039
You sick prick!

13
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,117
You sick prick!
What have you done!?

14
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:16,805
Relax, he's got nine left.
Now, are you ready or does he die?

15
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:22,842
I'm ready.

16
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,804
Good.
Got a pen?

17
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,722
Yes.

18
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,440
Good. First stop is the
antique shop on Highway Nine.

19
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:35,520
Red truck in the lot will have
a gun on the rack. You take it.

20
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,239
A gun, why do I need a gun?

21
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,716
Just in case...
Kill or be killed.

22
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,396
Like the Fleming novel.
Read any Fleming?

23
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,446
No, I don't read any Fleming and
I don't know how to use a gun.

24
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:50,078
We will teach you. Stop number 2 is
a payphone at Brice and Arroyo.

25
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:53,444
Now, bring your duffle bag for
the gun and don't even think about

26
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:54,636
talking to the copsl

27
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,042
Ma'am?

28
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,322
Nice truck.
Clean your windshield?

29
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,646
Oh, no. Uh, let me just,
get you uh...

30
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,842
Heyl

31
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,725
Hey, what the hell you doin'?

32
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:33,558
Just wanted to
clean her window.

33
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,924
He wasn't bothering you,
was he, Ma'am?

34
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:37,839
He's my uncle and normally
I don't leave him alone, but...

35
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:40,276
Oh, don't worry, no I was just,
trying to give him some change.

36
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:42,722
Oh, never mind.
Can I help you into your truck?

37
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:08,440
Have a nice day, Ma'am.

38
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,156
Hello?

39
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,442
Hello!?

40
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,325
Hello!?
Shit!

41
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:57,916
Shit!

42
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:03,766
- Hello?
- You're late.

43
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,000
This isn't easy, damn it.

44
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,522
What's with the Deputy?
You didn't call the cops, did you?

45
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:11,485
No, I didn't call the cops.
They just... showed up.

46
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm doin' everything...

47
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,761
Shut itl Now, the finger
was for openers.

48
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:19,835
If you fail us, we'll send you
his head. Do you understand?

49
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:23,556
Yes, I understand.

50
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,595
Tell me what's next.

51
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:31,716
Learn to use the gun.
1512 Arnez Street. Ask for Peter.

52
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:35,004
Take the weapon out and say,
"Show me how to use this.

53
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,601
My husband's a two-timing
son of a bitch."

54
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,443
Let me talk to...
Hello?

55
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:02,926
I'm looking for Peter.

56
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:04,876
Why?

57
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,919
I need him to show me
how to use this,

58
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,798
my husband's a two-timing
son of a bitch.

59
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:14,925
Where do I find Peter?

60
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,560
You're looking at her.

61
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,715
You want to put a bullet
in your husband's head...

62
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,641
You got my vote.
That's what I did to mine.

63
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,282
Come on.

64
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,001
Clip holds five rounds,
six in the chamber.

65
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,725
The barrel kicks so aim low
till you get used to it.

66
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,162
Come on.

67
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,443
Now remember, aim low.

68
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,203
All right now, grip it tight with
your left hand, ease up on the right.

69
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:18,405
Good... Now think of
your husband.

70
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,076
Think of him bangin'
all those little chippies.

71
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,685
What do you know
about my husband?

72
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,922
Oh, come on. They're all
the same model, aren't they?

73
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,765
Just with different serial numbers.
Now, go ahead.

74
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,282
Put his face over
the one on the target.

75
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,320
And aim low.

76
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,642
Hey, Peter, I'm locked
in here! Peter!?

77
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,358
- Hello?
- Nice shootin', Love.

78
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,882
Gets you all warm inside,
doesn't it, Sweet Cakes?

79
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,720
Now, get to your office,
log onto your computer,

80
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,765
download a file simply
entitled: "ORBS TAR."

81
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,360
Where do I deliver it?

82
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:27,444
Wait behind the tree by the dumpster,
someone will be there to meet you.

83
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,882
Then we'll arrange to
get you back to your son.

84
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,880
Little early,
aren't you, Jane?

85
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,277
Uh, just tryin'
to catch up.

86
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,317
You're workin' too
hard for too little.

87
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,195
Why you sellin'?

88
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,837
Oh, just need the money.
I got pink slipped.

89
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:57,475
Oh, Jesus.
Not you, too?

90
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:01,442
Goddamn corporations
are like tanks.

91
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,758
They don't feel nothin', they just
roll over the top of things.

92
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,477
Well... if you need some
help gettin' placed,

93
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,926
you know where to find me.

94
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:10,956
Thanks.

95
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,279
Yeah, I got that.

96
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,203
Yeah. I tried that.
Hang on.

97
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:22,402
Damn it.

98
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:28,876
Hello?

99
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,005
Sorry, our mistake.
It's been rectified.

100
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,396
Yes?

101
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:00,483
I didn't say view it.
I said download it.

102
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,516
Okay.
I'm sorry.

103
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,121
Shut upl Hurry, or
your son loses a hand.

104
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:23,522
Yes?

105
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,398
Get to the drop point,
you've got the gun incase

106
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,278
someone tries to stop you.
If there's trouble, remember,

107
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:29,557
- leave the bag in the dumpster.
- When do I get Michael?

108
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,599
Just wait here,
I should be...

109
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:58,880
What happened?

110
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,925
He got shotl Over therel
Right over therel

111
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:14,719
- Hello?
- Tell me what happenedl

112
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:20,120
I don't know. Uh, I was sitting there
and someone behind me just fired.

113
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,000
How do I know you didn't do it?
You had the rifle.

114
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:24,765
I didn't do it!
Are you insane?

115
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,525
What possible reason
would I have?

116
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,556
Where's the disc?

117
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:32,517
In a bag, in the dumpster.
Look, I don't know what

118
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:36,082
the hell happened back there but
I have done everything you asked me...

119
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,245
Please, just give me
back my son.

120
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:40,596
You're sure you left the gun
and the disc in the dumpster.

121
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,877
Yes! That's what I said!
Now, where's Michael!?

122
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:44,485
- Right behind you.
- What?

123
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,042
Mom!

124
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,162
Michael!

125
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,836
Oh, I'm coming!

126
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,326
- What'd you do?
- What?

127
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,005
What'd you do that
made them take me?

128
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:12,436
I didn't do anything, nothing.
How can you ask me that?

129
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,000
How can I ask you that, Mom?
Because first...

130
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,958
Your fingers?
It wasn't your finger...

131
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:17,998
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

132
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:21,842
Come on...

133
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,639
Get in the car.
I can walk myself.

134
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:24,881
Just get in the car!

135
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:37,566
I don't believe you. Aren't you
even curious what they did?

136
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:41,319
They locked me in box in some yard,
like a stupid hamster in a cage!

137
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,358
Michael, I know what you
must have gone through.

138
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,363
No, how could you know?
You weren't even there.

139
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,398
Look, you're okay now.
So just calm down.

140
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,685
Something's going on I can't
figure out until I get home.

141
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:53,282
Till I stop for a second,
I just can't talk.

142
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,206
You can't talk?

143
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,121
Some jerk-offs grab me outside of
physics class,

144
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,601
wrap tape around my mouth and
lock me in a box all night,

145
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,717
and you can't talk?
What the fuck, Mom?

146
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,520
Quit your goddamn swearing,
Michael, I'm warning you!

147
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:06,642
Mom!

148
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:09,719
They're gonna ram
us from behind!

149
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:10,756
Just hold on!

150
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:23,686
Oh God, are you all right?

151
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,042
Yeah.
Mom, look out!

152
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,996
Bitch!

153
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,480
Anything you want to
tell me?

154
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:59,519
Look, I just want to get home,
regroup and then I'll call the police.

155
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:04,722
Looks like somebody's
already done that for us.

156
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,038
Mom, don't run
from the cops!

157
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,282
Turn on the radio.

158
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,363
- The radio? Why?
- Just turn it on.

159
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:30,246
...another update on the CY-KOR
assassination after a word

160
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:31,402
from our sponsor.

161
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:33,836
Hil This is Billy Bob Parker
down at Downtown Dodge...

162
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,196
Just turn on the goddamn news!

163
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,122
You betchal

164
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:41,404
We're back with news radio 620.
In case you haven't heard,

165
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,883
Carl Churnings, the 55 year old
Chairman of CY-KOR was assassinated

166
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,964
this morning. Authorities have
started a state wide manhunt,

167
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:50,441
or should we say, "woman hunt"
for the suspect.

168
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,917
She's apparently a disgruntled
CY-KOR employee recently laid off

169
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:57,004
from the accounting department.
Her name is, and mind you, this is

170
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:00,562
not an alias, her name is "Jane Doe."
If you have any information as to

171
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,960
her whereabouts, please...

172
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,879
The whole thing was a set-up.

173
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,726
Mom, did you do it?

174
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,957
No, I didn't do it.
How the hell can you

175
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,759
even ask me that?
Don't you get it?

176
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,236
They set it up and now they're
trying to kill us and

177
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,686
pin the murder on me.

178
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,522
Well, Sheriff...
What you got?

179
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,275
Truck load of bad press for
your alma matter.

180
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,037
Looks like one of your employees got
a little pissed at her layoff notice.

181
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:41,285
We found this in a dumpster next
to the sniper sight.

182
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,158
A rifle inside was fired
three times...

183
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,002
Erick says he saw Ms. Doe
enter the building with it.

184
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,276
May I?

185
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,201
The janitor saw her download
somethin' off the work station.

186
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,161
Any idea what's on it?

187
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,363
Not yet. We're waitin' for
a criminalist.

188
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,518
We don't want to compromise
the evidence.

189
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:01,802
Of course.

190
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:05,200
Meanwhile, Mr. Avery, uh,
how do you want me to handle

191
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:08,284
the press? It looks like you've
got a bit of an image problem here.

192
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,007
I mean, this'll pretty much
make CY-KOR a household name.

193
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,964
You think you can keep
things contained?

194
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:14,958
At least until we can
determine her motives.

195
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,640
Well, I'll do my best.

196
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:17,962
Thank you.

197
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,758
Well, I better be headin' back.
I'm sure you got a lot to sort out.

198
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:23,880
Were you close to him?

199
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:24,916
Who?

200
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:26,406
The victim?
Churnings?

201
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,563
I mean, he was your boss in
Washington, wasn't he?

202
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:33,801
Yes, he was. I became CEO after
transferring from the London

203
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:34,996
office a year ago.

204
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:39,524
So we hardly knew each other, really.
But I had the utmost respect for him.

205
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,476
...I think it's time you quit
lying to me and tell me what you did.

206
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,802
I don't lie to you, Michael.
I told you-nothing.

207
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,681
Churnings was murdered in the
parking lot and they pinned it on you.

208
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,843
- They must've had a reason.
- How did you know his name?

209
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,646
I heard his name on the radio.
Look, it doesn't matter what his

210
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,837
name was, it...
what did you do?

211
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:16,526
Nothing. I don't know! God,
I sent Mr. Churnings a memo.

212
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:17,722
A memo?

213
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:18,916
Yeah, I sent him a memo.

214
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,764
A confidential memo to
Washington last week.

215
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:21,796
What was in it?

216
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,481
I... why? Why are you so
interested in this?

217
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,559
God, no wonder Dad split on us,
you're so dense sometimes.

218
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,764
You know, people kidnapped me.
Forgive me for being "interested."

219
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,479
- What was in the memo?
- Level 9 codes.

220
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:35,762
Which are?

221
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:37,838
Back door passwords.
They have access to

222
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,764
everything inside CY-KOR'S
data banks.

223
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:41,676
So...

224
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,195
So, someone was using them
without clearance.

225
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,517
I notified Mr. Churnings,
I guess he was...

226
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,805
Coming here to deal with it.

227
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,443
You should have just
stayed out of it.

228
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,364
Stayed out of it?
Stayed out of it.

229
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,643
Michael, it's my job.
That's what I do.

230
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,996
I administrate passwords.
You know, I assign them,

231
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:03,278
I monitor them, and I file memos
when someone uses them improperly.

232
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,761
Yeah, well, it looks you
filed one too many memos.

233
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:22,918
These appear to be wire transfers
into Churnings personal accounts.

234
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,920
There should be an authorization
code next to each amount.

235
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,401
Yeah, there is. The same in
each case, 2A11.

236
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,603
2A11, give me an ident on that.

237
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:39,283
2A11 is assigned to Jane Doe.
It's her password audit trigger.

238
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,486
Would it give her access to
cash transfer approvals?

239
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:44,717
Not directly, but with
a little innovation.

240
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,601
What's the bottom line total
on those wire transfers?

241
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,961
Uh... four million and change.

242
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:56,606
Four million buys a lot of innovation.
I guess that settles it, gentlemen.

243
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:58,919
It's clearly a case of collusion.

244
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:02,557
Churnings was extorting CY-KOR funds
with her acquiescence and

245
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:04,001
cutting her in on it.

246
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,398
We're still missing
a motive for murder.

247
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,761
How about blackmail?

248
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,843
Churnings secretary just
faxed this from Washington.

249
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,957
It's a letter she found
hidden in his desk.

250
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:16,245
"Carl, I have reassessed my value
in your corporate game-plan and

251
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:19,279
wish to adjust my compensation
accordingly.

252
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:23,876
This is not open to negotiation.
Any reluctance on your part will

253
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:28,523
have its consequences."
Any bets on who signed it?

254
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,038
Eddy, paint it and ship it.

255
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,642
...right, it's the truck stop
off of I-17. Hey, I gotta go.

256
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:47,002
Who did you call?

257
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,639
No one. I just tried checkin'
the messages.

258
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,042
Oh, you are so lying, Michael.
Who did you call, your father?

259
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,358
Well, good. Because don't think for
one second he would lift a finger to

260
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,442
help you.

261
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,796
Just chill, okay. I didn't
call him. How much did you get?

262
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,161
Eighty-two hundred.

263
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:01,084
Geez, Blue Book had to
be at least thirteen grand.

264
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,880
I know, Michael. I took what
he offered, okay.

265
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm sure they I.D.'d the car
and he don't have any money.

266
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,684
- There's someone following us.
- What?

267
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:09,955
Don't, don't look.
Come on.

268
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,880
We have more information now in
the shooting in Bolton, Montana.

269
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,483
CY-KOR sources have revealed
shocking details of a conspiracy

270
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,445
involving Carl Churnings,
the assassination victim and

271
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,165
the suspect, Jane Doe.

272
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:24,763
The two were apparently involved in
an extortion scheme that lead to

273
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:26,763
blackmail and Churning's
eventual murder.

274
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:31,559
Yeah, it's Tony down here at
Tony's Used Cars on I-17.

275
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:33,838
Yeah, you know that
Jane Doe on the TV?

276
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,237
Yeah. She was just here.
I just bought her car off her.

277
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,318
Yeah, she's right
outside the lot.

278
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:11,522
Freeze!

279
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:13,359
You twitch, I fire.

280
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,366
You breathe, I fire.

281
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,118
You don't slip me that gun
in five-milliseconds... I fire.

282
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:25,882
Who are you?

283
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,196
My name's Lucky.

284
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,722
I'm not gonna touch that.
Why are you following us?

285
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,761
All shucks, love, I'd really
like to tell you, but uh...

286
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:35,805
- it's just not ethical, is it?
- You sonovabitch!

287
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:41,001
Sticks and stones may break
my bones but I'm just doing me

288
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,366
freaking job!

289
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:43,755
Read any Fleming?

290
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,684
What? You mickin' all
my good lines?

291
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:46,876
Didn't he write:

292
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:51,325
"Stick your face in the bowl before
I unload this clip into your skull?"

293
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:54,757
No... I don't think
he wrote that.

294
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,840
Well, I think he did.
Stick your face in the bowl.

295
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:01,520
Can I flush it first?

296
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,798
You don't have that kinda time, Lucky.
Stick your face in the bowl!

297
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,243
Hey, Mom. I really
think we should go.

298
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:10,197
In the bowl with the
rest of the shit!

299
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:11,836
Lower!

300
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,924
Hell, no sense partin'
with this kinda cash.

301
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,195
I'd a given you
a ride for free.

302
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,885
Well, we're in a big hurry.
Can we just go?

303
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,519
You betcha.
Climb right in.

304
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,082
Yeah, I got 'em.

305
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:37,482
A black freight liner,
Montana plates...

306
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,957
Mary, Apple, 4-4-6-6.

307
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,482
Look out!

308
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:17,726

Just do what they say.

315
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,005
Hands up! Put 'em on

316
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,998
Come on. Get 'em in there!
Let's go!

Into the van! Let's go!
Move! Come on!

319
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:14,158
Who are you guys,
state police?

320
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,802
No, Mom, they're not
the state police.

321
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,286
Then who? FBI?

322
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,115
They're not the FBI.

323
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,642
Well, we're innocent.
We have rights, you can't just...

324
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:24,762
Mom...

325
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,155
Just shut up.

326
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,202
Hey, Dad!

327
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:11,756
Jane...

328
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:13,476
It's been awhile.

329
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:18,836
Get off me!

330
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:21,115
Back off her!

331
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,482
- Just get your hands off me!
- Put her down!

332
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:27,038
- Mom, it's okay.
- Don't touch me!

333
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,516
- Just let me...
- I said... don'touch-me.

334
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:33,236
Jane... if you calm down
I can explain everything.

335
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:43,164
- You hungry?
- Starving.

336
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:48,447
I got all your favorites.
Turkey... Pastrami on rye.

337
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:50,442
Thanks.

338
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,197
What about you,
have you eaten anything?

339
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:57,757
Have I eaten?
No, I haven't eaten, David.

340
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:01,083
Food has not been
a huge priority lately.

341
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,285
But would you mind just taking
a second to tell me where the

342
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,160
hell we are and why everybody's
been trying to kill us

343
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:09,846
and what are you doing in
the middle of this.

344
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,963
And why are you just
so goddamn calm!?

345
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,999
- I told you she'd be pissed.
- No, I am way beyond pissed.

346
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,965
I am way beyond pissed.
I am su-a-fuckin'-cidal!

347
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,635
And beyond that,
I had the fabulous good

348
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:22,723
fortune to get one of
my migraines this morning...

349
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,600
...you know, but in my haste,
to keep the little schedule that

350
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,319
my son's kidnappers devised for me,

351
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,437
you know, gun theft,
target practice,

352
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:31,284
short-range assassination,
that kind of thing.

353
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:33,761
I just mistakenly skipped out of
the house without my Motrin.

354
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:37,283
I could really use some Motrin,
David. About a pound of it.

355
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:39,915
Can you get that for me?
Can you get that!?

356
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:45,802
Simmons...

357
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:47,878
Could you get me some Motrin?

358
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,322
- Motrin?
- That's right. I said Motrin.

359
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,606
How long have you been talking
into your collar, David?

360
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,486
In nine years of marriage and
five years of divorce,

361
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,285
I've never seen you do that.

362
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,037
You said you were
in sales, David.

363
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:08,165
"Military salvage"
I think was the term.

364
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:11,478
At least that was the excuse that
kept you on the road 350 out of

365
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,245
365 days a year.

366
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,405
Business must be good, huh?

367
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:19,276
Got yourself your own little ranch?
Your own little goon squad.

368
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:24,681
Military Salvage salesman?
I don't think so.

369
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:26,678
So who the hell
do you work for?

370
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:28,966
The D. I.A.

371
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,405
The Drug Enforcement Agency?

372
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:35,242
That's D.E. A... D. I.A.
Defense Intelligence Agency.

373
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,484
Oh, your dad's a spook, Michael.

374
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:45,200
But you obviously knew.
We'll get to that later.

375
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:50,085
So what is it that you uh,
you guys do anyway?

376
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:53,486
I don't' think I've heard
that acronym on CNN lately?

377
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:56,355
We coordinate intelligence
operations for weapons procurement

378
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:58,363
and disposal for the
United States Government.

379
00:30:58,407 --> 00:30:59,362
How long?

380
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,238
The Agency was conditioned in 1975.

381
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:03,967
No, how long have you been
lying to me, David?

382
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,959
Since before we were married.

383
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:16,522
Jane...

384
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,484
It's the way things are done.

385
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:21,445
Here, just stay over there!
Just stay over there!

386
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:23,559
Don't patronize me!

387
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,760
Tell me the rest.

388
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:28,761
You were set up.

389
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:30,997
In a word: Duh!
By who?

390
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,680
- Avery.
- Avery.

391
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:36,198
He kidnapped Michael in order to
get you in place for the murder.

392
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:39,245
Then he staged an elaborate
cover-up to give you a motive.

393
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:42,122
I'm listening.

394
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,201
The disc you downloaded?

395
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,723
Had phony files on it linking you to
an extortion attempt with Churnings.

396
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,401
Avery's saying you tried to
blackmail him and when he wouldn't

397
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:52,005
play ball you had
Churnings killed.

398
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,283
Well, that's nonsense.
I sent Churning's a memo

399
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,557
telling him someone was
using unauthorized passwords.

400
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:58,080
That someone was Avery.

401
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:00,080
Well, why would he need...

402
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,560
Information.
You work there...

403
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:04,326
You know CY-KOR collates more of it
than any institution in the country.

404
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,047
He's been using the passwords to
access it to sell it.

405
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:08,396
Sell it?

406
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,644
He's got a deal to sell it off in
one big down load to a foreign broker.

407
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,285
Well, why is this stuff
so valuable?

408
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:15,482
Think about it.

409
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:17,722
Any foreign Intelligence Agency
would love to know who's in

410
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,201
financial trouble.
Who's vulnerable to recruitment.

411
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,557
Foreign pharmaceutical
companies would pay...

412
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:24,922
You... are a lousy
spin doctor, David.

413
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,956
It's the weapon's CY-KOR is
building, isn't it?

414
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:30,083
Reconnaissance satellites,
missiles.

415
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,636
You could probably give
a rat's ass about the rest of it,

416
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:33,676
am I right?

417
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,604
You were always
a fast read, Jane.

418
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:37,763
Just illiterate when it
comes to husbands.

419
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,686
So, arrest Avery.
Stop the data transfer.

420
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:44,439
No, we want him to sell it.

421
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:46,282
Why?

422
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,759
Because we doctored it.

423
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:53,240
We spent over a year with
my contact inside CY-KOR...

424
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,966
The data's poisoned with enough
disinformation on weapon's systems

425
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:59,316
to set a hostile government
back twenty years.

426
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:03,522
Why couldn't you just come to me?
Tell me what you were doing?

427
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,445
Frankly, we didn't need you.

428
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:13,477
Oh, that's right. You said you had
your little contact inside CY-KOR.

429
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:17,160
And so what poor dumb
sap were you able to turn?

430
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,760
That would be me.

431
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,279
Jesus, your own son.

432
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:35,323
You were a goddamn mole for him?

433
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:38,877
Is that what you are, a pathetic
little mole for the D.E.A.?

434
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:42,801
It's D. I. A! And I'm not a mole.
I'm an operative.

435
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,798
Oh, I'm sorry.
An operative.

436
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:47,197
Well, I should have
figured you wouldn't understand.

437
00:33:47,247 --> 00:33:49,078
- I mean, you're just a mom.
- Jane!

438
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:53,755
Got your Motrin.

439
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:01,567
Now then, I'm Kurt Simmons,
David's partner.

440
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,080
Can I get you anything else?

441
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:06,444
Yeah, a gun like that. I'd like to
unload it into my ex-husband.

442
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:07,562
She's funny.

443
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:09,322
I like her.

444
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,644
On behalf of the agency, I'd like to
apologize for all you've been through.

445
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,598
From here on out things will
run a lot more smoothly if you

446
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:15,636
just follow me.

447
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:16,796
Wait a minute.

448
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,082
Phelps wants 'em taken to
a safe house.

449
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:25,082
A safe house? Where?
Why wasn't I notified about this?

450
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:28,202
Well, David, your ability to
deal with the situation is

451
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:31,045
seriously hampered by your
relationship to the parties involved...

452
00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:34,161
We decided this was best.
Please, we haven't much time.

453
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,526
Wait a minute, hang on.

454
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,637
Look, call Phelps.
I got my orders.

455
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,036
What should I do?

456
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,156
Go with him.

457
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,199
I'll make sure you're safe.

458
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:56,882
Jane...

459
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,077
Avery didn't know
I recruited Michael.

460
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:02,238
It wasn't supposed to
turn out like this.

461
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:06,036
Yeah. That's what you said when you
got me pregnant at eighteen.

462
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,763
How long have you
worked for them?

463
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:37,801
Fourteen months.

464
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:39,876
How'd you do it?

465
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,843
I didn't.
You did.

466
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:44,322
What?

467
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:49,358
You know how you'd take home
those password backups at

468
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:50,886
night to analyze their activity?

469
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:53,316
Three times a week they'd
send me compressed files.

470
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,835
I copied them onto your discs
after you went to bed.

471
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,479
When you went to download those
files into the system the next day...

472
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:02,839
Dad's files went along with them.

473
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:04,082
You little shit.

474
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,879
Look, it wasn't supposed to
hurt you, okay.

475
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:07,838
It was meant to be a way to
spread bogus information,

476
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:09,764
that was it.
It was no big deal.

477
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:18,956
Just tell me why.

478
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:21,759
Did he promise you something?

479
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,798
Money, tax free dead presidents.

480
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,195
Oh, you disgust me.

481
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:28,962
Do I? I earned $50,000 for
a few hours of hack time.

482
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,884
What did you make?
Thirty, forty grand

483
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:33,519
a year punching some
time clock?

484
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:34,876
So where is it?

485
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,206
What?
The cash?

486
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,559
Dad said he's holding it
for me.

487
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,525
Jesus, you're pathetic.
Like he told me he was

488
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,603
a salvage salesman.
Your dad's a liar, Michael.

489
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:47,205
Why do you think I left him!?

490
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,203
Isn't that what your shrink
refers to as "denial," Mom?

491
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:50,202
Dad left you.

492
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,835
He left because he wanted
someone who wasn't so uptight.

493
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:54,479
Someone who could relate to
what he did.

494
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:56,040
Is that what he told you?

495
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:59,478
God! I wish he was half the
man you created him to be!

496
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,559
He never gave me a chance to
relate to what he did, Michael.

497
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:06,481
He never told me what he did!
He was just gone all the time. Gone!

498
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:15,955
We're stopping.

499
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,239
I wish he'd make up his mind.

500
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:39,641
Mom, he's gone!

501
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,320
I gotta get the wheel!

502
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:53,801
Here! Help me through!

503
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,605
Hold on, we're gonna crash!

504
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,082
Mom?

505
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:26,962
You okay?

506
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,917
Yeah, I'm okay.
Are you?

507
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,082
Yeah.

508
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,038
Come on, I'll pull you through.

509
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,161
Hold on, Mom. You okay?
I'm gonna get you out.

510
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:51,157
Michael... I'm not gonna be
able to get out of here.

511
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:53,161
I want you to go.

512
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:54,316
No way!

513
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,959
No. You'll be fine.

514
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:57,725
Come on! Come on!
I'm not leaving you!

515
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:00,679
Michael, you've disobeyed me your
whole life, don't do it now!

516
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:03,321
Get out of the van!
Get out of the goddamn van!

517
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:04,442
Get out!

518
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,882
Mom!

519
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,723
Can't you listen to me once!?

520
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:19,400
Just keep kickingl

521
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:34,960
This is Simmons. Tell Phelps
there's been an accident.

522
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:43,042
How'd they die?

523
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:45,675
Dellings says the authorities
picked them up a few hours ago.

524
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:48,202
Apparently the van transporting
them crashed on route.

525
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,439
How fabulously tragic.
Call Lazar...

526
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,718
Tell him I'll meet
his deadline.

527
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,444
Mom, can we just take a break?

528
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:10,804
Can't. They'll be all over
this place to check the wreckage.

529
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,760
Then can we just take a minute to
figure out where the hell we're going?

530
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,316
I know where I'm going.
To see a man named Niles.

531
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:18,286
Why? Can he get us to
the border.

532
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,005
I'm not going to
the border.

533
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:23,645
- Well then where are we going?
- Straight into their hearts.

534
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:27,077
Would you just stop and tell me
what the hell you're talking about?

535
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,922
Michael, I have spent my entire life
as your mom trying to help you

536
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,322
and if I survive this,
I will spend years trying to

537
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:36,439
figure out how I failed you.
But right now I am sick of

538
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,443
carrying the guilt of
you growing up fatherless.

539
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:40,086
What does Dad have to
do with this?

540
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,119
Everything! He got us here.
Him and you lying to me.

541
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,119
So the way I see it...

542
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,600
I gave you your life and you
just helped me give me back mine

543
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,682
so we're even.

544
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:56,843
You wanna be your own man now, fine.
You can follow me or you can leave.

545
00:40:58,607 --> 00:40:59,835
Fair enough?

546
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,797
Yeah. That sounds fair.

547
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:10,082
Thank you.

548
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:15,805
Wait a minute.
Who's this guy, Niles?

549
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:19,962
He's a research scientist for CY-KOR.
We worked on special projects.

550
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,197
He's got a remote node
connection to Central Data.

551
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:23,436
What good is that?

552
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:26,524
From there I can shut Avery down.
Force him to make a deal.

553
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:28,366
These guys don't deal.

554
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,758
You get somebody by the balls and
squeeze hard enough, trust me...

555
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:33,475
they deal.

556
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:37,002
You know, there's room in
here for two.

557
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,245
What the fuck happened, Kurt!?

558
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:47,847
I don't know. Sniper, I guess.
One of Avery's guys.

559
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:50,355
Bullet hits the tire,
we go over this fuckin' cliff.

560
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:53,516
Your wife and kid are in the back,
I couldn't get 'em out.

561
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:56,038
It's all I could do was
jump out of the door.

562
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:00,916
David, under the circumstances
I think it's best you

563
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,320
take some time off.

564
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:05,682
Your support team can
follow things through.

565
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:07,838
I don't need time off,
it's my mission.

566
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:10,567
It's the Agency's
operation, David.

567
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:14,323
And you're aware of Agency rules
regarding emotional proximity

568
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,322
to victims.

569
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:18,399
That didn't stop you from
leaning on me to recruit my son.

570
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:20,360
You could have refused.

571
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:22,438
The Agency doesn't
like refusals.

572
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,677
Precisely, so why start now?

573
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:28,081
Take some time off.
Lester can drive you.

574
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:34,797
I'll drive myself...
Might be healthier that way.

575
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:48,718
Well, I guess we weren't
too convincing.

576
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,316
Fuck him.

577
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:56,677
I'm layin 'here like the Mummy.
I did all I could.

578
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:01,800
No matter. His role's become
muddier by the moment.

579
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:03,605
It's best he's deactivated.

580
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:05,841
Fine with me.

581
00:43:17,727 --> 00:43:18,762
David!

582
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:21,395
Nine lives, baby.
Nine friggin' lives!

583
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:23,319
- What are you talkin' about?
- Your wife and kid.

584
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,323
Recovery called, they got
a van, no bodies.

585
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:26,800
It looks like they're alive.

586
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:30,357
Kurt said that they were locked in
the back when the van went airborne.

587
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:33,161
Kurt must've been mistaken.
Van's flat as a pancake.

588
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,562
Ain't no way they gotten out
after it hit.

589
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,245
Does Phelps know about this?

590
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:39,515
Goin' to tell him.

591
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,125
What is this place,
the entrance to the Bat Cave?

592
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:45,757
Sort of. It's the back door to
CY-KOR's research facility.

593
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:48,956
Michael, don't!

594
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,598
Do not alter your coordinates.

595
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:54,402
Yeah, right!

596
00:44:54,447 --> 00:44:56,005
- Michael!
- I'm outta here.

597
00:44:58,687 --> 00:44:59,881
What was that sound?

598
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:01,241
You'll see.

599
00:45:03,487 --> 00:45:06,559
Niles, Nile's turn off the alarm,
it's Jane. Jane Doe.

600
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,761
Damn it, Jane. Get inside
before someone sees you.

601
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:12,761
Come on, Michael.

602
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:23,677
Who's the little punk pukin'
all over my property?

603
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:25,566
It's my son.

604
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:27,922
How in God's name did you
know I'd be here.

605
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:30,726
Niles, please. I know you work
here alone at night.

606
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,521
There's not much that goes on
around here I don't know about.

607
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,917
Then I suppose you know you're in
a whole lot of trouble.

608
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,605
They say you killed Churnings.

609
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:40,076
Niles, you know me.
I'm not a murderer.

610
00:45:40,247 --> 00:45:42,636
Avery set me because
I found evidence he's

611
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:44,757
been selling off
classified data.

612
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,881
Selling the blue prints of
what you build out here.

613
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:50,515
If that's true, what makes
you think I give a damn?

614
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:52,639
I'm dyin' to vacate this
place anyway.

615
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:55,446
I know that. But I also know
they must something that

616
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:56,636
keeps you here.

617
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:58,402
I'm listening.

618
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:01,245
I can find the file.
I can erase it,

619
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:03,398
I can make it go away, Niles.

620
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:09,205
Let's just say I buy into this
absurdity for a second and assume

621
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:12,080
you're tellin' the truth.
What do I gotta do for you?

622
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:14,841
Let me use your remote node to
access the system.

623
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:16,526
And then what?

624
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:18,723
We get to live another
twenty-four hours.

625
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:23,365
I gotta get outta here, man.
The night nurse in here has

626
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:25,557
breath so bad she needs
a Tic-Tac with a battery.

627
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:29,122
Simmons.

628
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,203
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

629
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,119
- She's still alive.
- Who?

630
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:35,926
Whol? Who do you thinkl?
Jane-fuckin'-Doe!

631
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:37,122
Jesus.

632
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:39,721
Yeah, he's someone you better
start prayin' to if you don't

633
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,327
find out what she wants and
then find her a body bag.

634
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:44,842
Alright, alright, trust me.
She's about to be dead along

635
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,878
with that little prick
husband of hers.

636
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:53,682
David.

637
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:55,796
Kurt.

638
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,083
Hey, how ya doin', guy?

639
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:05,959
Deal is... once we're inside
my records get erased first.

640
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,687
Fine. Just piggy-back in on
the D.O.D.'s trunk line,

641
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:10,604
that way CY-KOR can't trace us.

642
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:21,481
She's all yours.

643
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,283
If they really set you up
what makes you think you're

644
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:27,646
still clear to log on?

645
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:30,881
I'm using passwords only
Churnings knew about.

646
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:33,717
It'll take me
a few minutes to sequence.

647
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:37,602
Feel better?

648
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:42,001
Yeah. Now would you mind explaining
what the hell you did to me?

649
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:46,878
Sure. You got zapped by
sado-acoustic pulse waves-handy

650
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:48,326
for crowd control.

651
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:50,921
It's one of 20 NLWs
I'm workin' on out here.

652
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:52,122
NLWs?

653
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,323
Non-lethal Weapons Technology.

654
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:57,720
From the folks who brought
you Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

655
00:47:57,887 --> 00:48:00,082
Opening soon at
a battlefield near you.

656
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:03,047
What's this?
More crowd control?

657
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:08,281
Nope. Data control.
It's a mock-up of an EMP bomb.

658
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:12,443
It delivers an electromagnetic
burst of over four trillion watts-

659
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:16,083
Incapacitating any electronic
device in a 100 mile grid.

660
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:18,404
So what does it
do to humans?

661
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,077
Good question. One I ask them
from time to time.

662
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:25,799
They tell me, "We'll have to
drop one to find out."

663
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:30,646
Don't look for morality at the D.O.D.,
look for a whole new generation of pain.

664
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:32,922
I'm in.

665
00:48:34,527 --> 00:48:35,846
You got full access?

666
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:37,322
Looks like it.

667
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:40,161
I've been tryin' to break into
these files for ten years and

668
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:42,437
all this time all I had to
do was ask you?

669
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:47,120
Niles, until today I've never
illegally altered a record in my life.

670
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:49,845
Unlike the rest of
my family.

671
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:57,562
It's all here.
Every last lyin' bit.

672
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:00,359
Can we lose it?
Permanently?

673
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:06,238
Say goodbye to
Niles Anderson.

674
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:12,761
I'm dead.

675
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:14,599
Just a ghost in the machine.

676
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:15,762
What's next?

677
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:19,367
Churnings had a password that
would lock up all data in

678
00:49:19,407 --> 00:49:21,398
the event of a virus
or security breach.

679
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,044
No one knew about it but him.

680
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:26,724
And me of course,
I set it up.

681
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:39,686
I just wish I could be
there to see his face.

682
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:47,043
We're still down.
We've tried everything.

683
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,521
Every CPU is down.
Every trunk line is blocked.

684
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:50,915
That's impossible.

685
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,885
Initiate the restore procedure.
Start by disconnecting the drives.

686
00:49:58,927 --> 00:50:01,157
Tried that. The first one
we unhooked auto-erased.

687
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,162
What?

688
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,482
The lockup mechanism employs
a fail safe virus that prevents

689
00:50:04,527 --> 00:50:06,199
any storage disconnection
from the CPU.

690
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:07,202
What are you saying?

691
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:08,600
We're frozen.
Locked up.

692
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:10,080
What could have caused this?

693
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,719
You're not gonna like this.

694
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:14,636
I only managed to
get one screen to boot.

695
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:48,882
Thanks for the money.
Thanks for the clothes.

696
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:50,402
Thanks for everything.

697
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,199
No, it's me that
should thank you.

698
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,675
That file you erased was
my ball and chain.

699
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,478
You gonna tell me
what's inside it?

700
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:00,556
Why?

701
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:03,400
Maybe it'll help me understand
what I'm up against.

702
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:09,765
I headed one of D.O.D.'s
early germ warfare projects.

703
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:12,722
It was only supposed to
be tested on cattle.

704
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,159
But they slipped the agent in
a hepatitis B vaccine to

705
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:17,959
check its affect on humans.

706
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,155
I never knew.

707
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:25,160
46 out of 60 patients
died within a year.

708
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:27,679
I quit when I figured it out.

709
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:29,599
Threatened to tell
the whole story.

710
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:31,956
They threatened to pin it on
me if I didn't keep my mouth

711
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:33,406
shut and stay on board.

712
00:51:34,687 --> 00:51:37,201
Phony vaccination records
were in that file.

713
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:41,277
These guys play hard, Jane.
And they play for keeps.

714
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:46,716
You wanna stay and
watch me play back?

715
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:50,598
I'd love to, but I got
a date with Elvis.

716
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:51,802
Who?

717
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:54,959
That's what I nicknamed
the miniature EMP prototype.

718
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:57,084
It's scheduled for preliminaries
in the morning.

719
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:58,606
I thought you wanted out.

720
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:02,682
I worked two years to build the thing.
Like to see if it works.

721
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,164
You take care of yourself,
Jane.

722
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:07,396
You betcha.

723
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:16,999
Yeah? Hold on for a second.
Jane Doe on line one.

724
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:22,682
Hello?

725
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:25,321
If anyone else is on this line you
may not want them to hear this.

726
00:52:25,487 --> 00:52:26,920
There's no one else
on the line.

727
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:28,878
I figured out what
you've been doing.

728
00:52:29,047 --> 00:52:31,197
The downloads.
The data sales.

729
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,164
I don't know what
you're talking about.

730
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:36,165
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you might
want to get on line so you could

731
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:38,516
make your little delivery date.
My mistake.

732
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:43,919
That stupid cow.
She better pray...

733
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:48,476
Wait...
Don't hang up again.

734
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:50,126
Give me a reason not to.

735
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:51,322
What do you want?

736
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:52,641
That's more like it.

737
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:55,245
One million.
Cash.

738
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:57,156
When?

739
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:58,362
An hour.

740
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:00,715
That's impossible.

741
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,445
Then you're history.
Bye.

742
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:05,599
Wait! Where do you
want the money.

743
00:53:06,287 --> 00:53:07,720
Don't get ahead of
yourself.

744
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:10,003
All right...
what else?

745
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:15,522
Safe passage for me and my son.
Invent another patsy for the murder.

746
00:53:16,007 --> 00:53:18,601
Deal.
What do we do now?

747
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:20,999
Let's play like old times.

748
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:22,596
What?

749
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,564
Antique Shop,
on Highway Nine.

750
00:53:24,927 --> 00:53:26,758
They'll be a message in
a red truck.

751
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:28,599
I don't have time for games.

752
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:32,396
You don't have time, period.
These are my rules, or you don't

753
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:34,677
get the disc that unlocks
the system, got it?

754
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:36,276
Got it.

755
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:37,316
Good.

756
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:41,678
Oh, and don't send that pissy
little messenger boy like you

757
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:42,762
did last time.

758
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:45,316
That guy got shit
faced on the job.

759
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:52,677
That little slag, she's dead.
D-E-A...

760
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:54,922
Dead!

761
00:53:58,207 --> 00:53:59,799
It's done.

762
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,523
All right, we're backin' off.
It's in everybody's interest for

763
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:10,206
her to get Avery back on line
so we can trade the data.

764
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:12,403
It's after the deal that
I'm worried about.

765
00:54:12,567 --> 00:54:15,957
I want my family to live a long.
Far away from here.

766
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,924
How patriarchal of you.

767
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:20,078
We'll talk after
the deal goes down.

768
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:21,879
We'll talk now or
Kurt wears a headstone.

769
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:24,999
You know me better than that.
Simmons is expendable just like you.

770
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:28,797
I figured. And I bet you don't
figure yourself as expendable.

771
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:30,719
Are you threatening me,
David?

772
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:32,957
You remember the thermal imaging
gun we kept handy on

773
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:34,406
the black ops back in the day?

774
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,962
Vaguely.

775
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:37,998
I've got digital imprints of
everything.

776
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:40,356
They were black ops.
We did what we had to do.

777
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,916
Where do you get off playing
the blushing bride?

778
00:54:43,087 --> 00:54:46,363
I'm sure your brand of chicanery is
pretty much S.O.P. With Company get

779
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:49,479
ahead quick artists like yourself.
I'm pretty sure there's still some

780
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:52,405
Americans who'll blanch at government
agents fraternizing with drug lords

781
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:54,597
and getting blow jobs from
Cuban transvestites.

782
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:58,637
You wouldn't do that to me.
You wouldn't do that to the Company.

783
00:54:58,807 --> 00:54:59,762
Try me.

784
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:04,397
I assume you've got an airborne
ranger doing a lock scan on this call.

785
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:06,641
I'll have it recalled.

786
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:07,722
No. I want it.

787
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,082
Tell our boys to drop and
clear and you bring me my

788
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:11,560
family and I fly them out.

789
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:13,604
You follow,
you trace or surveil...

790
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:16,122
And I swear to God I'll download
your little film festival to

791
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,727
Diane Sawyer, Dan Rather
and Howard fuckin' Stern.

792
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:21,959
Okay, David.
You have my word.

793
00:55:22,207 --> 00:55:24,198
I don't trade in that
currency anymore.

794
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:36,155
Hey, buddy.
I'm seein' snakes out here.

795
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,202
She screwed us!
There's no red truck!

796
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:47,676
There!

797
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:55,886
- Well?
- Well what?

798
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:57,682
What does it say?

799
00:55:57,847 --> 00:56:00,156
It says, "Payphone, Brice and
Arroyo in five minutes.

800
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:01,925
Don't be late shit head.
Jane."

801
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:02,956
Let's go.

802
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,959
She's doin' this all, that's it!
I want to kill her fucking truck!

803
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:08,599
Just shut up and drive.

804
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:12,886
Wake up!

805
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:30,636
The man doesn't know
how dead he is.

806
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:48,966
Hey! Jesus!
Fuckin' Shit!

807
00:56:49,007 --> 00:56:50,235
Shit!

808
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,196
Hello?

809
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:53,396
Is that you, Lucky?

810
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:55,199
Don't play games with me, bitch!

811
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:56,800
You played 'em with me.

812
00:56:58,567 --> 00:56:59,556
Bloody hell!

813
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:03,045
Suck up to her, damnit.
Don't blow this.

814
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:07,602
Hello, love.
Long time, no speaky-weaky.

815
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:08,966
Shut up.
You got the money?

816
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:10,360
Oh... Have I got the money?

817
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:12,318
Haliburton case.
Is Haliburton all right?

818
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,358
I mean, we didn't have
time to shop around.

819
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:16,762
Yeah, that'll be fine as long as
there's a million dollars inside it.

820
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:19,719
540 Broxton. Third floor.
Ten minutes.

821
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:23,402
540 Broxton. Third in ten.
Got it. Anything else, love?

822
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,876
Yeah. You've got a little
zit on your neck.

823
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,436
I'd pop it before
the head gets unsightly.

824
00:58:03,887 --> 00:58:06,481
You-whoooo... Janey?

825
00:58:08,687 --> 00:58:13,238
Love? You've got some
explainin' to do...

826
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:27,599
"Up the stairs, down the hall,
left down the next set of stairs..."

827
00:58:35,687 --> 00:58:37,996
Baby... Darling...

828
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:44,680
Nice to see you can
follow directions, Lucky.

829
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:49,685
Drop the case in the hole
in the center of the room.

830
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:52,839
Well hello, love.
Come out where I can see you.

831
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:54,161
I've missed you.

832
00:58:55,287 --> 00:58:59,246
There's a nine-mil aimed at your
heart and you know I know how to use it.

833
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:00,322
Right...

834
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:05,404
Well, how do I know you won't
shoot me and take the dough.

835
00:59:06,007 --> 00:59:07,645
Just drop it and go.

836
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,715
Right.
Okay.

837
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,998
Anything you say...
Love, anything you say.

838
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:36,041
Chrome's a fashion fuck-up in
a handgun, boy. It reflects the light.

839
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:38,602
Shut it!

840
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:47,796
Lucky, I warned you!

841
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,199
Better not scream,
before I kill you boy.

842
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:54,922
Mom!

843
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:56,002
Michael!?

844
00:59:56,687 --> 00:59:59,155
How bloody predictable!

845
01:00:13,727 --> 01:00:15,080
Mom! Behind you!

846
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:20,755
Well, well, well.

847
01:00:22,407 --> 01:00:25,319
It's my turn to have a bit of
fun, isn't it?

848
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:28,766
Yes... a bit of Lucky fun.

849
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:33,965
Mmmm, very nice.

850
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:41,443
Oh, never realized you had such
a doable little rack!

851
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:45,604
It'll be a shame to carve it,
love, wouldn't it?

852
01:00:46,087 --> 01:00:51,400
Now, you can pick the pieces or
you can give me back my disc and

853
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:56,277
I'll do you quick and painless.
I swear to God.

854
01:00:57,447 --> 01:01:00,837
You want to say something, Love?
You want so say something?

855
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:03,123
Go ahead, say it?
What do you say?

856
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:05,517
What do you say?
What you gonna say?

857
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:13,325
That... I'm afraid is gonna
cost you three piggies.

858
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,046
This little piggy...

859
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:19,198
Oyel Tough guyl

860
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:21,082
Peter!

861
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:22,799
What exactly do you think
you're doing, Lucky?

862
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,680
What's it look like I'm doing,
Peter? I'm freakin' workin'.

863
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:28,321
Why you botherin' me while
I'm freakin' working!

864
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:29,522
Working?

865
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:31,285
Looks like you've been
feeling her up!

866
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:33,397
You have any idea
how degrading that is?

867
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,558
Well, call me a pervert.

868
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:38,845
Call me kinky but just get
the fuck out of my face...

869
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:41,237
And call me some
other fucking time!

870
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:46,720
What'd you do that for!?

871
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:48,957
We had a deal.
You didn't pay.

872
01:01:49,127 --> 01:01:50,924
I was gonna pay.
I swear.

873
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:54,204
But this bitch survived and
someone had to take care of it,

874
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:55,236
didn't they?

875
01:01:55,287 --> 01:01:56,481
Oh, I left you messages.

876
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:59,325
I would have called you.
I swear on your mother!

877
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:03,719
I really don't like it when
people swear on my mother.

878
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:04,802
Look, Peter...

879
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:07,042
- Get down on your knees.
- We can work this out.

880
01:02:08,447 --> 01:02:09,766
We are working it out.

881
01:02:10,047 --> 01:02:13,119
Now get down on your knees and
apologize to her.

882
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:15,398
You never told me you
were settin' her up.

883
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:17,478
You just said to show
her the ropes!

884
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,877
What difference does
it make what we did!?

885
01:02:21,087 --> 01:02:24,045
Tell her that you're
a sadist and a misogynist...

886
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,562
...and that you're very,
deeply sorry.

887
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:28,756
I'm... I'm sorry.

888
01:02:28,927 --> 01:02:31,521
No, say it all.
Say, "I'm a sadist..."

889
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:32,761
I'm a sadist...

890
01:02:32,807 --> 01:02:34,035
And a misogynist...

891
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,042
And a...

892
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:40,441
Why don't you give me a fuckin' word
I can pronounce you stupid little cunt!

893
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,963
God, I hate the "c" word,
don't you?

894
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:51,564
Michael!
Michael!

895
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:00,965
Michael!? Oh, God!
Michael!?

896
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:03,525
Can you help me get him down?

897
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,042
Oh, God.

898
01:03:15,047 --> 01:03:16,082
Michael...
Oh, God.

899
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:17,401
Move. Move!

900
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:22,556
Breath.

901
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:24,756
No!

902
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:27,042
Breath.

903
01:03:28,527 --> 01:03:30,882
Michael...
Oh, God... God...

904
01:03:46,807 --> 01:03:48,638
Wait a minute,
where you going?

905
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:51,965
I've got no fight with you.

906
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:55,565
They hired me, they didn't pay.
I took care of it.

907
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:57,886
My business here is done.

908
01:03:58,327 --> 01:03:59,919
What if I was to hire you?

909
01:04:02,287 --> 01:04:03,322
As what?

910
01:04:03,487 --> 01:04:04,442
I don't know...

911
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:07,755
A body guard?

912
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:10,241
How much we talking?

913
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:12,883
A hundred thousand dollars
sound about right?

914
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:15,959
Sounds real right.
Where you gonna get it?

915
01:04:17,127 --> 01:04:19,118
Did you see a Lincoln
parked out front?

916
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:20,720
Yeah.
Avery's inside.

917
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:24,199
Good. He's supposed to
have a million dollars in

918
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:25,202
a case for me.

919
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:26,722
And if he don't?

920
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:34,838
Well... I suppose it don't
cost nothing to find out.

921
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,082
I realize there's been a delay.

922
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:51,877
I'm telling you not to worry.
The exchange will go down as planned.

923
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:21,202
Enough!

924
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:24,766
Enough!
I'll give you the money!

925
01:05:33,647 --> 01:05:36,639
I've been real busy the last
twenty-four hours thanks to you.

926
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:43,564
And I am so tired of the bullshit
I feel like I could just... go off.

927
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:47,922
Like I could just start unloading
the rounds in this clip, like

928
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:50,043
candy from a Pez dispenser.

929
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,196
I said I've got your money.

930
01:05:55,887 --> 01:05:56,922
Then get it!

931
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:02,085
Thought you worked for Lucky!

932
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:04,677
Guy didn't live up to
his name, did he?

933
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,637
It's all here.
Want to count it?

934
01:06:28,087 --> 01:06:29,440
Where's the disc?

935
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:31,245
Michael, give him the disc.

936
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:38,518
That's for keeping me
locked in a box.

937
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:44,757
I don't care what happens to CY-KOR.
Don't follow us or screw us or

938
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,604
I'll leak everything.
Come on, Michael.

939
01:06:46,647 --> 01:06:48,000
How do I know this will work?

940
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:50,317
You don't.
Need a lift?

941
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:00,644
Red Tango, this is Control.

942
01:07:01,207 --> 01:07:02,162
Go ahead, Red Tango.

943
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:03,720
I have a locate on the suspects.

944
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:06,685
Heading north on I-17
in a black pickup.

945
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,205
You think he took the bait?

946
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:16,077
He's a desperate fish, ain't he?

947
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:28,041
Pull off the road!

948
01:07:36,247 --> 01:07:37,362
It's David.

949
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,484
Look, I believed in what we were
doing but I never knew Phelps was

950
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:49,721
running a rogue op.

951
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,924
He thinks as long as you're
alive his operation's compromised.

952
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:56,921
I can get you and Michael over
the border but only if we leave now.

953
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:05,922
If you screw me over,
I'll kill you myself.

954
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,401
It's more than we agreed upon.
But you earned it.

955
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:24,716
Come on.

956
01:08:27,487 --> 01:08:30,081
Boy...
I know your face.

957
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:32,444
If anything happens to these two,

958
01:08:32,607 --> 01:08:37,078
I'll track you, I'll find you,
I'll skin you and I'll eat you.

959
01:08:37,807 --> 01:08:39,763
It's been nice meeting you, too.

960
01:08:50,327 --> 01:08:52,079
You set us up,
you sonovabitch!

961
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:53,521
No, I didn't.
Come on.

962
01:08:57,407 --> 01:08:59,125
All right, let's go!
Come on!

963
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:04,115
That's the only warning
you're gonna get.

964
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:06,598
You better listen to me, David.

965
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:10,798
Get your family away from
the damn chopper... nowl

966
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:18,316
What do we do?

967
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,160
- Any idea what's on it?
- No. It's totally encrypted.

968
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:22,636
Can it hurt us?

969
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:24,604
Well, the system's already
incapacitated.

970
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:27,042
It couldn't get much worse.
Should I run it?

971
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,402
Yeah.

972
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:39,922
Are we back?

973
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,195
Tell you in a sec.

974
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:50,796
Yeah, we're back.
The data seems in tact.

975
01:10:08,447 --> 01:10:11,405
How quaint...
The "Does" reunited.

976
01:10:13,687 --> 01:10:15,086
What time does it go down?

977
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:17,477
Shut up. This isn't
your party anymore.

978
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:19,399
No need to be melodramatic,
Simmons.

979
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:22,757
David set this up. There's nothing
wrong with him seeing it play out.

980
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,282
Especially now that it depends on
his wife's ability to

981
01:10:25,327 --> 01:10:26,476
activate the system.

982
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:29,798
We're monitoring
Avery's residence.

983
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:32,800
He's inside. He hasn't
moved for three hours.

984
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:37,121
Not the behavior of a man about to
make the score of a lifetime.

985
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:42,516
Any action?

986
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:44,956
Nothin'. Lots empty.

987
01:10:46,887 --> 01:10:47,922
So it is.

988
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,363
Avery's made a deal to sell off
the data to an international broker

989
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:53,362
named Lazar.

990
01:10:53,527 --> 01:10:55,836
It was scheduled to be exchanged
an hour ago.

991
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:59,915
You better pray that little stunt of
yours didn't foul up Avery's plans.

992
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:01,958
The password was on
the disc I gave him.

993
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,963
That's all he needs to
unlock the system.

994
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,763
Sir, got a van pulling
into the lot.

995
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:12,682
Is this scheduled?

996
01:11:12,847 --> 01:11:15,680
Yeah. They clean the cafeteria.

997
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:18,841
Anything unusual?

998
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,762
Nothing. This ain't
how it's goin' down.

999
01:11:23,967 --> 01:11:25,241
Is Avery still inside?

1000
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,681
Hasn't moved.

1001
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:32,123
I made a mistake in
your case, David.

1002
01:11:32,687 --> 01:11:34,325
I'm already regretting it.

1003
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:41,679
Phelps insisted I recruit Michael.
I listened to him.

1004
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:43,485
What are you talking about?

1005
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:46,117
The Cree Indians used to
take a boy, nine or ten and

1006
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,964
indoctrinate him into a war party.

1007
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:51,439
They wanted to teach him the world
was cruel and complicated...

1008
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:54,720
...that life needed to
be cherished and fought for.

1009
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:58,802
He's just a boy, David.
Your boy, your own flesh and blood.

1010
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:01,197
That's why I wanted him to
learn it from me.

1011
01:12:01,367 --> 01:12:03,005
Well was it all worth it?

1012
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,682
What have you got left to
fight for now, huh?

1013
01:12:05,727 --> 01:12:07,718
What does he have left to
fight for, this?

1014
01:12:09,407 --> 01:12:12,046
Sir, I was wrong.
Looks like we got activity.

1015
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,805
I'm in back of the Data Wing where
they've connected water lines.

1016
01:12:16,927 --> 01:12:19,760
They're rock hard and they're
definitely not hoses.

1017
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:22,796
Fiber connection.

1018
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:24,522
What?

1019
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:29,802
Kid could be right. A high bandwidth
optical fiber connection.

1020
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,641
They've probably connected to
the main data banks via the...

1021
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:34,882
...fiber line and that's how
they're downloading the files.

1022
01:12:34,927 --> 01:12:37,122
How long would something
like this take?

1023
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:40,359
Fiber can transfer a terabyte of
data in five minutes.

1024
01:12:57,727 --> 01:12:59,046
Target's in motion.

1025
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,919
Let the games begin.

1026
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:17,479
Get the mobiles into position.

1027
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:19,205
Move it, move it, move it!

1028
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:38,564
Sir, are you getting clean audio?

1029
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:40,365
Yeah, but give me more level.

1030
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:42,245
All right, let's get outta here.

1031
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:43,476
Come on, let's go.

1032
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:58,002
Now that I've delivered
I think I'm due an apology.

1033
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,364
Screw the apologies. You were
compromised, you cost us time.

1034
01:14:01,527 --> 01:14:03,006
What's a day between friends?

1035
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,203
Everything. I have
a schedule to keep.

1036
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:07,927
Look, why argue.
It's all here.

1037
01:14:08,727 --> 01:14:12,276
Show me proof you've wire-transferred
my funds and we'll part amicably.

1038
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:14,758
When I verify the data.
Kwan?

1039
01:14:14,927 --> 01:14:15,916
Yes, sir.

1040
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:17,281
How does it look?

1041
01:14:17,567 --> 01:14:19,046
I'll know in a moment.

1042
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:25,245
Is this your idea of a joke?

1043
01:14:26,607 --> 01:14:28,006
What are you talking about?

1044
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,839
This is useless, it's
completely encrypted.

1045
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,878
It looks like some type of
high level PGP encoding.

1046
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:33,526
Playing with us, Avery?

1047
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:35,683
Where is the encryption key?

1048
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:39,879
I don't have.
I didn't encrypt it.

1049
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:44,758
The disc... she gave me to
unlock the system...

1050
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,483
...must have installed
the encryption mechanism.

1051
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:49,638
You little twit!
What did you do!?

1052
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:54,118
I downloaded a batch program that
encrypts the data on the trajar boot.

1053
01:14:54,287 --> 01:14:55,276
Is that possible?

1054
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:57,244
Yeah. Complicated but possible.

1055
01:14:58,007 --> 01:14:59,326
What's the password?

1056
01:14:59,487 --> 01:15:01,443
There isn't one.
It morphs randomly.

1057
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:03,717
The stuffs garbage.
Face it, you're screwed.

1058
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,799
Are you guys getting this?

1059
01:15:18,687 --> 01:15:20,803
Move all units to
the CY-KOR Data Center.

1060
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:24,482
I want every workstation confiscated
and taken to the holding facility.

1061
01:15:24,647 --> 01:15:26,365
You don't have
the authority to do that.

1062
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:30,281
Don't I!? Section 518,
National Security Act.

1063
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:34,645
By the time CY-KOR files a protest,
I can duplicate the data and arrange

1064
01:15:34,807 --> 01:15:36,843
a sale to Lazar through
one of our assets.

1065
01:15:37,007 --> 01:15:39,567
Do you really think some
15 year old punk...

1066
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:43,682
...and Miss Suzie-fuckin'-homemaker
can outwit the U.S. Government!?

1067
01:15:44,287 --> 01:15:45,436
Get 'em outta here!

1068
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,518
Let's go!
You're out! Move it!

1069
01:15:48,407 --> 01:15:49,442
Move it out!

1070
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:54,724
So what do I do with the Does?

1071
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:59,244
This isn't Family Feud, we don't
give consolation prizes. Kill 'em.

1072
01:16:21,007 --> 01:16:22,759
All right, that's far enough.

1073
01:16:23,047 --> 01:16:25,356
No sense dwelling on it,
who wants to be first?

1074
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:28,321
How about me?

1075
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:32,683
Let's see if you have
the stomach for it.

1076
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:34,316
Cool.

1077
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:38,555
Who's next?

1078
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:50,279
- Come on!
- Michael, come on!

1079
01:16:58,287 --> 01:17:00,517
How'd you know he'd
aim at your chest?

1080
01:17:01,447 --> 01:17:04,917
They follow procedure.
Never go by the book.

1081
01:17:05,767 --> 01:17:07,200
What are we gonna do now?

1082
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:09,198
Beat Phelps to the end of
the rainbow.

1083
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:11,437
I got enough ordinance in
that Bell Ranger to blow

1084
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:13,159
the data center back to
Great Falls.

1085
01:17:13,327 --> 01:17:15,318
I thought you wanted
the deal to go down.

1086
01:17:17,287 --> 01:17:19,005
I wanted a lot of
things once.

1087
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:22,519
Doesn't mean I'm proud of it.

1088
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:26,482
Phelps isn't gonna have
a sense of humor about this.

1089
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:29,286
But I got a tape underneath
the seat that I can...

1090
01:17:29,487 --> 01:17:30,442
See ya.

1091
01:17:39,527 --> 01:17:40,596
Oh, God. Dad.

1092
01:17:40,847 --> 01:17:43,077
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

1093
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,042
Did they teach you to
fly these things!?

1094
01:18:07,967 --> 01:18:09,036
Niles.

1095
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:15,042
Now, I'm not gonna say you're
crazy cause that's just too

1096
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:17,157
damn implicit.
Don't ask me to do this.

1097
01:18:17,327 --> 01:18:19,636
It's the only way, Niles.
You gotta believe me.

1098
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:20,836
It's the only way left.

1099
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:23,680
Look, I'm not even scheduled to
launch for three hours.

1100
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:24,716
I can't just...

1101
01:18:24,887 --> 01:18:27,355
You can Niles. You can.
You have too.

1102
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:30,201
They'll be there any minute
and it'll be too late.

1103
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:35,242
Niles!

1104
01:18:35,287 --> 01:18:36,640
Shut up, I'm busy.

1105
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:46,961
Niles, are you there?

1106
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,364
Niles, please talk to me.

1107
01:18:59,287 --> 01:19:01,323
Move it, move it.
Come on, let's gol

1108
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:04,556
Niles!

1109
01:19:07,287 --> 01:19:08,322
God help me.

1110
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:12,359
What the hell are you doing!?

1111
01:19:21,847 --> 01:19:22,802
Jane?

1112
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:25,647
Yes, Niles?

1113
01:19:27,527 --> 01:19:29,279
Elvis has left the building.

1114
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,924
Ground code, I want the perimeter
sealed and move all the vans to

1115
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:38,605
the exit doors.
You got that?

1116
01:19:39,527 --> 01:19:41,836
Okayl Move it boys and
girls, let's gol

1117
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:48,806
Phelps, is that you?

1118
01:19:50,247 --> 01:19:51,600
Yes, this is Phelps.

1119
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:56,926
Well, this is Jane and there's
three things you should know.

1120
01:19:57,087 --> 01:19:58,042
I'm listening.

1121
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,640
One, I'm still alive.

1122
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:01,839
I think I intuited that.

1123
01:20:02,807 --> 01:20:05,162
Two, I've got David's tape.

1124
01:20:07,607 --> 01:20:10,440
Okay...
What's the third thing?

1125
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,644
When you see a shooting star...

1126
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:13,722
Yeah?

1127
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,166
...don't wish on it.

1128
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,925
Everybody get back!
Everybody get the fuck backl

1129
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,447
Good afternoon, can I have
your passport, please?

1130
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:44,122
Thank you.

1131
01:20:56,807 --> 01:20:58,718
Go on.
Go on.

1132
01:21:04,887 --> 01:21:07,720
...Investigators will be
revealing more details later

1133
01:21:07,767 --> 01:21:10,725
on this evening. Now the irony of
the whole explosion is that

1134
01:21:10,767 --> 01:21:14,077
it was one of CY-KOR'S own missile
prototypes that strayed off course.

1135
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:18,521
The loss of CY-KOR's data banks has
sent a mob of credit list consumers

1136
01:21:18,567 --> 01:21:20,046
into the department stores today...

1137
01:21:20,087 --> 01:21:23,443
...as, for the moment, everyone's
credit slate has been wiped clean.

1138
01:21:23,687 --> 01:21:25,006
People are ecstatic.

1139
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:46,602
Yeah?

1140
01:21:47,727 --> 01:21:49,957
Sir, I think we got
a locate on Jane Doe.

1141
01:21:50,127 --> 01:21:51,162
Let it go.

1142
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:52,802
What?

1143
01:21:52,847 --> 01:21:55,407
It's over. We pin
the Churnings thing on Avery.

1144
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:57,797
She walks. Nobody
touches her, got it?

1145
01:21:58,727 --> 01:21:59,876
Well, yeah, but why?

1146
01:22:00,047 --> 01:22:04,040
Because I've got my orders, okay?
And I don't question my orders.

1147
01:22:05,727 --> 01:22:07,604
So, why are you standing there?

1148
01:22:08,727 --> 01:22:11,685
I'm not... standing here.

1149
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:29,803
"Dear Michael, if you're reading
this note, then obviously...

1150
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:32,516
Well, what the hell...

1151
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:35,918
Enclosed is the safety deposit box
key where I've held onto your money.

1152
01:22:36,087 --> 01:22:38,840
All of it's there...
along with a little bonus.

1153
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:41,881
Actually, it's the rest of
my operational budget.

1154
01:22:42,487 --> 01:22:44,478
But don't worry,
they can't trace it.

1155
01:22:44,647 --> 01:22:47,798
Remember, always think for yourself
and no matter what happens,

1156
01:22:47,847 --> 01:22:50,919
always take care of your mother.
She's the best thing that every

1157
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,481
happened to you and the worst
thing you could ever lose.

1158
01:22:53,647 --> 01:22:57,322
Take it from me. I found out
the hard way. Love, Dad."

1159
01:23:00,487 --> 01:23:02,205
Hey, Mom!
Let's go!

1160
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:05,125
What's the matter?
What happened.

1161
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:06,686
Don't ask.
Just let's go.

1162
01:23:09,407 --> 01:23:10,681
Was the money there?

1163
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:11,762
Oh, yeah.

1164
01:23:11,807 --> 01:23:12,762
And the bonus?

1165
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:13,882
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:17,156
Well, Christ, Michael are you
gonna tell me how much it was?

1167
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:18,885
Over two million dollars.

1168
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:21,082
Two million?

1169
01:23:21,127 --> 01:23:22,116
In cash.

1170
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:27,517
Oh...
You're gonna hate this but...

1171
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:30,205
we should probably give it back.

1172
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:33,045
What are you crazy? How the hell
we supposed to do that?

1173
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:36,002
I don't know.

1174
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:40,237
But I guess there's nothing wrong
with taking forty or fifty years to

1175
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:41,276
figure it out.

1176
01:23:43,687 --> 01:23:44,722
Hey, Mom?

1177
01:23:46,487 --> 01:23:47,522
I love you.
