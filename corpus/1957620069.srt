[music playing]

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,306
 Hi, Harry, I'm leaving early.

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,974
It's my kid's birthday.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:16,850
SOPHIE: Bye, Diane.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,643
 So long, Sophie.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,106
COWORKER: Bye, Diane.

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,736
 What are you doing here?

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,822
You're supposed to be in
Hoffman's office in 10 minutes.

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,783
 The conference
call went on forever.

10
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,952
If you can find me 301 I swear
I'll give you my firstborn.

11
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:35,869
 No thanks.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,955
I've met your firstborn.

13
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,207
Why don't you try
300, specific intent.

14
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,416
301 is general.

15
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,376
 300, that makes sense.

16
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,627
I'll give it some thought.

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,128
 You've got about
35 seconds then I

18
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,381
suggest you move your ass, sir.

19
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,008
 If you could get your law
degree, I'd hire you like that.

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,927
 You'd have to put me
through college first.

21
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,388
I'd cost you a bundle.
Now get out of here.

22
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,185
OK, we're going to
have to make this fast.

23
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,397
It's Sean's birthday and I
got a zillion things to do.

24
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,691
Can't let a little thing like
a reception for the governor

25
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,359
get in the way of
picking up my son's cake,

26
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,735
et cetera, et cetera.

27
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,321
OK, what have we
heard from The Grand?

28
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,823
 OK, The Grand, the
international ballroom

29
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,533
holds 350.

30
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,410
That's good, but
check with the Regency

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,870
and see if they can match
the Grand's price per person,

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,998
and not with rubber
chicken either.

33
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,374
Music?

34
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,917
 I have a call into the union.

35
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,128
I was thinking maybe
classical, what do you think?

36
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,462
 That's great.

37
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,256
 Press release, I'll
handle that myself.

38
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,425
You want to call the governor's
office and tell them that?

39
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,301
 OK.

40
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,927
 OK, that does it.

41
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,679
 I'm so glad they asked you
to introduce the governor.

42
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,222
You know, the partners
are pushing for you.

43
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
That's because I'm female.

44
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,059
They're so 1960s around here.

45
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,561
They don't have
any lady partners,

46
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,979
as they like to call them.

47
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,314
OK, see you later.

48
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,315
 Bye.

49
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,649
 Thanks.

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,029
[music playing]

51
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,528
 Don't let this happen again.

52
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,042
 Going down?

53
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,024
 Down to parking?

54
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,543

[tire screeching]

56
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,562
 Lady, what are you doing?

57
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,625
 Sorry, ma'am, but
you can't stop here.

58
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,127
 I'm sorry, where am I?

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,546
 Where do you need to get to?

60
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,883
 Could you-- could you
give me some suggestions?

61
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,345
 Um Giffordsville, Porta City.

62
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,846
 Porta City, yes.

63
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,264
Porta City.

64
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,724
 OK, which side?
East side?

65
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,475
West side?

66
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,482
 Where there are houses?

67
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,651
 Um, Bryland, maybe.

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,986
 Yes, Bryland.

69
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,405
 OK, what you do
is you go straight--

70
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,281
 Wait, wait, wait.

71
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,533
Wait a second.

72
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,700
Would you just wait a second.
- Sure.

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,118
- I just want to--
- No problem.

74
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:27,869
 Write this down.

75
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,959
Yes.

76
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,712
 Go straight, take
the first right.

77
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,256
You'll get to an overpass.

78
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,674
 An overpass.

79
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,093
 Go over the overpass.

80
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,554
And then when you
get to Haslet Avenue.

81
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,347
 Haslet.

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,434
 Just look to your right
and you'll see Bryland.

83
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,310
 Thank you.

84
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,562
- OK.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,563
- Gonna be OK?
- I think so.

86
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,438
 Great.

87
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,231
 Thank you.

[vacuum cleaner]

89
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,975
 Hey, Scamp.

90
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,978
Hey, little guy.

91
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,480
 He's afraid of
the vacuum cleaner.

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,065
 There's a first.

93
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,442
 Say again.

94
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,402
 What are you doing vacuuming?

95
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,696
 Somebody has to do it.

96
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,781
I thought you'd be
home right after lunch.

97
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,033
 I-- I--

98
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,118
I got stuck at the office.

99
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,995
 What?

100
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,830
 I had a million things to do.

101
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,248
 Oh yeah?

102
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,126
Then why did they tell
me you left hours ago?

103
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,294
 You called the office?

104
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,379
 Of course I did.

105
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,048
 What did you do that for?

106
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,508
 Because those hotshot lawyers
think they own you, Diane.

107
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,886
You were supposed to have
the afternoon off, remember?

108
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,055
Where have you been,
it's 4:30 for God's sake.

109
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,848
 Why are you giving me
the third degree, Jack.

110
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,099
Because I was worried.

111
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,351
 I'm sorry.

112
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,518
 Well, you could
have at least called.

113
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,436
 I know, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,937
 You should be.

115
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,064
 When did the kids get here?

116
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,441
 A couple hours ago.

117
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,609
 Did you leave the
cake in the car?

118
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,738
 My gosh.

119
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,573
 Don't tell me
you forgot again.

120
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,367
You forgot again, didn't you?

121
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,534
What's wrong with you, Diane?

122
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,537
You used to be like an elephant.

123
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,040
 I'm just going to
forget I heard that one.

124
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,500
 I guess I should go
pick it up now, huh?

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,043
 Would you?

126
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,878
It's paid for.

127
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,380
And the cold cuts.

128
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,131
The market's just
a few doors down.

129
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,425
 You didn't even pick up
the food for the party?

130
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,302
Diane, there are
18 people coming

131
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,720
over here in a few hours.

132
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,305
I don't know what you
expected them to eat.

133
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,264
 I'm sorry.

134
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,057
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,441
 Hi.

136
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,902
He just fell asleep.

137
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,737
I'll put him in his
crib in a minute.

138
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,122
Hey, it's your grandma.

139
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,001
 Whatcha looking for?

140
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,920
 Grandma's picture, you know,
the one you said I could have

141
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,213
for the mommy and me group.

142
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,424
It's the graduation
one, I think.

143
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,050
You remember?

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,511
We're doing that
generational thing.

145
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,887
 Oh, yes.

146
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,056
Yes, I was going to
show you, that's right.

147
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,142
Now where did I put
the [inaudible]??

148
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,309
 Actually, you know what?

149
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,853
Don't worry about it.
- No, no.

150
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,812
I put it-- I put it in--

151
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,565
I put it in here I'm, sure.

152
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,566
 Mom, don't worry about it.

153
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,317
OK?

154
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,569
I left work early to help you
set up, so let's get started.

155
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,445
 I'm sorry, sweetheart.

156
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,071
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,364
 I just wish you called.

158
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,074
It's like trying to
make conversation

159
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,243
with dad for two hours, it's
like total silence or Vietnam.

160
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,453
 Give him a break, sweetheart.

161
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,037
It's been a long week.

162
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,748
 Yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,168
 I hope that's your husband,
we need help with the drinks.

164
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,377
 OK.

165
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,253
What?

166
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,963
What do you need?

167
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,298
 Glasses.

168
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,549
Ice.

169
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,342
That stuff.
- Will you watch him?

170
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,135
 Yes, sure.

171
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,349
 Where is that birthday boy?

172
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,311
For he's the jolly
good fellow, for he's

173
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,940
the jolly good fellow,
for he's the jolly good

174
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,653
fellow, which nobody can deny.

175
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,238
 There you go, kid.

176
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,615
I've been working all day
on this, haven't I, Tracy?

177
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,493
 Oh yes, slaved for
hours over those roses.

178
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,702
Make a wish, doofus.

179
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,495
 I already did.

180
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,294
[cheering] And it came through.

181
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,047
She said yes.

182
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,967
Everybody, you are
all the people that we

183
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,552
love most in this world.

184
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,514
And we know about being
stupid and everything

185
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,225
but we wanted you to
be the first to know.

186
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,393
We got engaged, baby!

187
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,812
 You can't do this.

188
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,855
You're supposed to be my
bratty little brother.

189
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,732
Wow.

190
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,733
DIANE MCGOWIN: Oh my goodness.

191
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,026
 Did you know about this?

192
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,486
DIANE MCGOWIN: No, I didn't.

193
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,698
Is [interposing voices]
Oh goodness, darling.

194
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,075
Oh my.

195
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,619
We have to open the
champagne, champagne.

196
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,287
Oh, can I use the camera?

197
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,831
 I just got one more shot left.

198
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,625
 OK, go on, give him a hug.

199
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,923
 Now, no getting married
till after grad school.

200
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,887
I'll get-- I'll get
some more film--

201
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,264
oh!

202
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,181
 Diane!

203
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:40,974
 Mom!

204
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,185
 I'm OK.

205
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,144
 Are you all right?

206
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,937
 I'm OK.

207
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,359
 I'm all right.

208
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,069
I'm OK.

209
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,404
 You're supposed to put one
foot in front of the other one,

210
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,280
babe.

211
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,656
 You're all heart.

212
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,450
 What did you trip on?

213
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,327
 I'm fine.

214
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,121
I'm a klutz.

215
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,123
I'm a klutz.

216
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,876
Stop looking at me.
I'm OK.

217
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,464
I'm really fine.

218
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,299
Go on now, stop.

219
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,802
I'm fine.

220
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,451
 You really shaken up?

221
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,878
You fell hard.

222
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,339
 I just slipped, that's all.

223
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,799
 No, you didn't.

224
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,800
I saw it.

225
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,843
You didn't slip.

226
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,261
You didn't trip either.

227
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,640
 I know, Paula,
something's wrong.

228
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,392
 Excuse me, you
get some more film?

229
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:11,022
 Yeah, um, I think in
the top-- oh, the top--

230
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,190
right there in the top one.

231
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,030
So how does it feel, pop?

232
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,657
 Meh, he's too young.

233
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,241
What's he getting engaged for?

234
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,910
 Remember love?

235
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,954
 I do, and a lot of
the things that passed

236
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,247
for it when I was that age.

237
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,042
 You'd better not be
talking about me, marine.

238
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,712
Because I remember you
camping out on my doorstep,

239
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,715
night after night,
begging me to marry you.

240
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,925
 That's not the
way I remember it.

241
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,218
 You just wore me down.

242
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,135
 You were crazy about me.

243
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,553
Wasn't she, Paula?

244
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,098
 I was crazy anyway.

245
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,683
 Leave me out of this.

246
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,017
I'll catch up with you, later.

247
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,234
 Now what's up, kid?

248
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,946
You told her something
was wrong, what is it?

249
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,240
 My baby's engaged.

250
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,282
 I heard.

251
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,743
His timing stinks if you ask me.

252
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,620
He's already lost
two years of college

253
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,706
because of the accident.

254
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,624
Between us, I hope she's
not pregnant because they

255
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,543
got absolutely nothing.

256
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,212
 For that matter,
neither did we.

257
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,299
And that turned out
all right, didn't it?

258
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,051
 You tell me.

259
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,844
 I asked you first.

260
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:25,847
 Mostly.

261
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,897
You sure you're all right?

262
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,648
 Mostly.

263
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,819
 Well, the party's downstairs.

264
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,237
You coming?

265
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,322
 Yeah, I'll be there in
just a couple minutes.

266
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,033
 Here's to looking at you, kid.

267
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,732
 Mom, what are you doing?

268
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,234
There's a party
going on downstairs.

269
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,569
 I found it.

270
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,487
 Found what?

271
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,530
 Grandma's picture.

272
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,242
 Mom, I didn't mean for
it to be such a big deal.

273
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,368
 Oh no, I've got it right here.

274
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,244
Look.

275
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,538
I found it.

276
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,998
 Oh wow.

277
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,541
She was gorgeous.

278
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,211
 Wasn't she?

279
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,798
 I remember her being all
drawn and sunken, really old.

280
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,965
 No, she wasn't old.

281
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,676
She was 55 when she died.

282
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,303
She was just sick.

283
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,847
There are all kinds
of things in here,

284
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,018
notes and letters, baby
pictures of you and Sean.

285
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,353
 Mom.

286
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,021
There's 20 people downstairs.

287
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,814
Come on.

288
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,909
 I'm confused.

289
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,912
I've never been confused before.

290
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,249
I'm forgetting words that
I've known my whole life.

291
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,750
I feel-- I feel--

292
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,964
I feel my thoughts just
slipping out of my brain.

293
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,258
Something's wrong.

294
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,219
I need-- I need
tests or some kind

295
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,929
of brain scan or something.

296
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,473
Something's wrong.

297
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,269
 Is there any Alzheimer's
in your family?

298
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,062
 Alzheimer's?

299
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,147
God no.

300
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,815
How old do you think I am?

301
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,776
 I know, but there's an
early onset Alzheimer's.

302
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,486
The fact that it's
not very common

303
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,864
and there's no history your
family says that's not what's

304
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,323
going on here,
but I have to ask.

305
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,034
 No, my father died
of a heart attack.

306
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,119
My mother had cancer.

307
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,495
You know that.

308
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,081
Both my parents
were sharp as tacks.

309
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,291
As are you.

310
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,668
But I'm sure it's just stress.

311
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,545
You're working 60 hours a week.

312
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,380
But if you want me to send
you to neurological testing,

313
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,798
I can do that.

314
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,550
I'll make some calls and
set up an appointment.

315
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,551
Now, let's see.

316
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,179
What's a good time for you?

317
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:17,685
 Um, OK, um, all right.

318
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,604
I'll just-- I'll call you, then.

319
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,778
 Uh, Jack still quality
control at Lockman?

320
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,738
 Yeah.

321
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,282
 They have good insurance.

322
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,575
 Oh, I'm sorry.

323
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,453
 Everybody does
that at some time.

324
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,454
 Do they?

325
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:40,833
[music playing]

326
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,129
 Mama.

327
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,497
DIANE MCGOWIN: So do I have it?

328
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,917
 The spec test says you do.

329
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,378
It's not totally
accurate but your scores

330
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,506
were in the 95th percentile.

331
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,467
 Really?

332
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,635
95?

333
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,095
That's the best
grade I ever got.

334
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,931
My mother would be so proud.

335
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,310
 Do you really
think that's funny?

336
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,728
 Probably not.

337
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,981
It's not even true, I
got 95s in everything.

338
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,525
So how long before
I'm a vegetable?

339
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,568
 I wouldn't use that word.

340
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,116
 How about, um, basket case?

341
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,872
 Do you want to tell me
about how frightened you are?

342
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,167
 Do you want to tell me
what's going on in my brain?

343
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:28,959
 Diane, we don't know.

344
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,674
With Alzheimer's you
can never be sure.

345
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,843
One of the most frustrating
things about this disease

346
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,762
is you will never--

347
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,138
you'll never be able
to know what to expect.

348
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:49,063
Depressions,
hallucinations, confusion.

349
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:54,402
There'll be times when you won't
remember how to dress yourself,

350
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:59,532
how to use a knife and
fork, even who you are.

351
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,034
Right now you feel
really bad because you

352
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,953
are in a downward spiral.

353
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,704
But there'll be
times when you'll

354
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:11,127
feel all right, whole periods
when everything will be normal.

355
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,255
I noticed you came by yourself.

356
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,340
Have you told your
family about this?

357
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,800
 No.

358
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,553
 You might think of
telling your husband.

359
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,096
 And then again, I might not.

360
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:22,847
 Why is that?

361
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:26,767
 Can I go home now?

362
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:35,860
 Hey, you're home early.

363
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,489
 I went shopping.

364
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,741
 Yeah, what for?

365
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,495
 A dress, for the
governor's thing.

366
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,914
 Am I expected to go
to that thing with you?

367
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,916
I hate those deals, you know.

368
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,043
 You don't have to.

369
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,005
 What are you doing?

370
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,256
 Nothing.

371
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,215
 You know, I got
league tonight.

372
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,581
 Stampy, get off the bed.

373
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,000
You're not going in today?

374
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,168
 Headache.

375
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:16,919
 You want an aspirin?

376
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,132
 You use a knife and fork
to eat with, don't you?

377
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,972
Answer me.

378
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,806
 Yeah, of course you do.

379
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,019
 I thought so.

380
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,646
 Do you want me to call
the office and tell them

381
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,606
you're not coming on?

382
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,192
 No, I'll go in later.

383
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:40,985
 All right.

384
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:50,202
[music playing]

385
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,126
 I got to run.

386
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,168
I'll see tonight, OK?

387
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:58,961
 OK.

388
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,434
Mom?

389
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,349
[phone ringing]

390
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,357
 On no!

391
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,455
 Mom?

392
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,541
You awake?

393
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,292
 Yes.

394
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:26,799
 Feeling any better?

395
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,888
 Yes.

396
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,723
 Is your headache gone?

397
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,141
 What are you doing here?

398
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,685
 Dad told me you've been
in bed a couple of days

399
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,103
with a bad headache.

400
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,271
 Days?

401
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,274
 I've been thinking, maybe
it's menopause or something.

402
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,192
 I better call the office.

403
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,529
 Dad did that already.

404
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,322
Did you hear what I
said about menopause?

405
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,241
 Yes, I heard.

406
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,492
 What do you think?

407
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,119
You've been forgetting things.

408
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,956
You never used to
get headaches before.

409
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,083
Mom, you should call a doctor.

410
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:05,462
 OK, I'll go to a doctor.

411
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,755
 Promise?

412
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,216
 I promise.

413
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,010
 Hey, you never showed
me the dress you bought

414
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,221
for the governor's party.

415
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,015
 Oh, it's in the, um,
where I keep my clothes.

416
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:25,274
 Wow, it's sensational.

417
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,316
 You think?

418
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,737
 Not too much.

419
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,655
 Except for the price.

420
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,574
 Well, the office
is paying for it.

421
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,409
 Ah, then it's
definitely not too much.

422
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,379
[music playing]

423
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,869
 Hi.

424
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,873
Hi, [inaudible].

425
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:23,707
Good to see you.

426
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,662
 Come on, Diane.

427
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,538
Time to introduce
the man himself.

428
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,089
Oh my god, Diane McGowin
actually has stage fright.

429
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,260
- Knock 'em dead, Diane.
- Nobodies going to believe it.

430
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,595
 So here's the gal I have
to thank for putting together

431
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,556
such a terrific evening.

432
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,766
I don't suppose you
remember my party?

433
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,769
 What party?

434
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,271
 Diane's not political.

435
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,689
It's part of her charm.

436
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,481
OK, let's go.

437
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,155
Diane, relax.

438
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,744
 Let's hear it for Diane.

439
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:47,082
[cheering]

440
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,467
 I'm sorry.

441
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:07,853
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,018
[phone ringing]

443
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:48,894
 Hello?

444
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:54,858
 Is this 555-0196?

445
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,444
 Yeah, mom?

446
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,195
 Who is this?

447
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,367
 So what happened?

448
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,827
 Well, I got there
and Jimmy was there.

449
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,373
And mom said she was OK but
she was really freaked out.

450
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,582
 Did she know who you were?

451
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,750
 Yeah, of course
she knew who I was.

452
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,043
 What happened at the thing?

453
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,795
Why'd she call you
in the first place?

454
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,588
 Well, Ginny says that she like
froze on stage, on the podium.

455
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,007
JACK: You mean,
like, stage fright?

456
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,886
 Yeah, and then she ran out,
like right through the crowd.

457
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,596
JACK: She just ran away?

458
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,847
 Yeah.

459
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,474
JACK: Did she talk
about [INAUDIBLE?

460
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,684
 No, she didn't.

461
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,851
You know Mom.
She said she was OK.

462
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,269
She didn't want
to talk about it.

463
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,980
But she didn't talk at all.

464
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,315
JACK: Did you tell her you knew?

465
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,358
 I didn't what to say.

466
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,235
She wouldn't talk about it.

467
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,404
 She was-- she was
quiet the whole way home.

468
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,489
JACK: You guys haven't seen her
taking any pills or anything,

469
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,074
have you?
- Give me a break.

470
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,868
Mom's never taken anything
stronger than an aspirin.

471
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,996
 All the stress working
for those lousy lawyers.

472
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,330
Now she's losing it.

473
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,331
 Somebody doesn't
just lose it overnight.

474
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,666
 It's not overnight, dammit.

475
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,210
She's been losing it
for a long time now.

476
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,420
 I've got Alzheimer's disease.

477
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,023
JACK: Diane?

478
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,582
Diane?

479
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,917
[dog barking]

480
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,382
 Diane?

481
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,597
What you doing, Scampy?

482
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,118
Diane?

483
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,877
What are you doing in here?

484
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,047
This can be very
dangerous, you know.

485
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:28,720
 I was just thinking about
when I was a little kid.

486
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,102
And we used to go to Grandma's
every Sunday, everybody, aunts,

487
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:39,523
uncles, cousins,
the whole family.

488
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:44,820
I loved being part
of a big family.

489
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,949
We'd have dinner and
it would get late.

490
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,536
And my dad would drive us home.

491
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,248
And I'd curl up in the
back seat, close my eyes,

492
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,124
and I'd fall asleep.

493
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,337
Then we'd turn into
that long driveway

494
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,758
and I'd wake up and see my
house with the trees all around.

495
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,556
And it felt so safe.

496
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,229
 You scared the hell out of me.

497
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,065
 Sorry.

498
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:27,112
 I don't know about this
Alzheimer's thing, Diane.

499
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:31,283
Well you're-- you're really
the smartest person I know.

500
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,078
I mean, even now, you've
still got a real high IQ.

501
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:40,083
And you know, nobody
has to know about this.

502
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,085
It's nobody's business.

503
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,753
You know, the next
time you're having

504
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,840
a spell or something like that,
you can just stay at home.

505
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,388
 I'm going to die in a very
degrading, horrible way.

506
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,015
 Oh, who says that?

507
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,975
 I am.

508
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,435
I'm going to end
up like an infant.

509
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,811
 Come on.

510
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,521
You're not going to
end up like an infant.

511
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,024
 I am, Jack.

512
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,192
And you need to know that.

513
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,570
I need to know
that you know that.

514
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,864
 It's an awful lot to take
in all at once, isn't it?

515
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,950
I mean, I'm sorry if I'm not
acting the way I'm supposed to.

516
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,911
I'm doing the best I can.

517
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,787
You didn't even tell
me in the first place.

518
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,748
 Because you don't hear me.

519
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,375
I don't know how many years
it's been since you've heard me.

520
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,171
 You've always got to get
your digs in, don't you.

521
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:30,467
 OK, I didn't
tell you because I

522
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,845
don't feel I can count on you.

523
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:40,518
You're not there and I'm
scared because a really

524
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,395
big thing is coming
and I'm scared

525
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,482
you're not going to be there.

526
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,274
Are you?

527
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,614
 Never really ever needed
anybody but yourself.

528
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,369
 Is that your answer?

529
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,373
OK.

530
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,665
It's great.

531
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:29,336
I got a disease that
sounds like a beer.

532
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,047
 It stinks.

533
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,591
 Let me count the ways.

534
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,301
 What are you going
to do for money?

535
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,596
 Well, you know, I mean we've
got Jack's military pension.

536
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,848
And you know, he's
making enough.

537
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,974
 Oh, bull.

538
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,852
It's always been
on your shoulders.

539
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,644
I talked to the partners.

540
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,777
We've agreed to give you
six months at full salary.

541
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,694
 What?

542
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,363
 We took a vote.

543
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,864
It was unanimous.

544
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,658
 You don't have to do that.

545
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,952
 There's no discussion.

546
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:03,703
 Thank you.

547
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,667
I don't know what to say.

548
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,669
 I don't know
what to say either.

549
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,966
I'm-- I'm sorry, Diane.

550
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,135
I'm just so sorry.

551
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,140
 Toodaloo.

552
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,489
Want a cup of coffee?

553
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,240
 I've already got one.

554
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,248
 Don't forget, not a word about
my quitting to your father.

555
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,166
 I know, I won't.

556
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,292
I still don't see
why not, though.

557
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,588
 Because I said so, OK?

558
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,216
He'll just worry
about the money.

559
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,260
 Well, maybe you should
start thinking about selling

560
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,554
grandma and grandpa's house.

561
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,473
It's been five years
since grandpa died, right?

562
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,350
 Hell no, I'm not
going to sell the house.

563
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,768
Where would Grandma live?

564
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,270
 Mom, Grandma's dead.

565
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,488
 That's right.

566
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:25,869
Anyway, I don't want
your father to know.

567
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,120
Or your brother.

568
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,290
 OK, what about Paula?

569
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,541
 Paula.

570
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,959
I don't know where Paula is.

571
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,419
 You haven't heard from her?

572
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,378
 No

573
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,296
 Are you sure?

574
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,213
 Yes I'm sure.

575
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,966
What's wrong with you?

576
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,386
 After a coffee we're going
to go for a walk, right?

577
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,013
I'm going to take him
for a walk in a bit.

578
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,475
 Let me have him.

579
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,893
I'll take him for a walk.

580
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:50,894
 Mom, no.

581
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:51,686
 What?

582
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,151
Oh, you never know
where we'd end up.

583
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,281
 I'm sorry, it's just--

584
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,242
 I'd never do
anything to hurt him.

585
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,160
 I know.

586
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,369
I know that.

587
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,412
Let's all go for a walk.

588
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,371
 I don't want to go for a walk.

589
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,132
TELEVISION: Dr. Kevorkian--

590
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,383
 I'm going to bed.

591
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,052
TELEVISION: To a
heart monitor then put

592
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,929
an intravenous tube in her arm.

593
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,431
He said she was
unconscious in 25 seconds

594
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,017
and died in five or six minutes.

595
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,770
Dedicated teacher all her
life, 56-year-old Adkins

596
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,356
was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease a little

597
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,607
over a year ago.

598
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,192
However, family
member she insisted--

599
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,818
 No.

600
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,903
TELEVISION: That she was a
rational mind when she made

601
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,738
the decision to take her life.

602
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,490
They have made an
official request

603
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,827
to the district attorney hoping
there will be no prosecution.

604
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,871
Detroit city council
today voted on a measure

605
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,122
that would fund more than 15--

606
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,801
 Have Lisa's parents said
anything to you about me?

607
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:05,677
 No.

608
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,469
 No.

609
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,393
Do you-- do you
feel embarrassed?

610
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,395
Because I know your dad does.

611
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,688
 Why do you say that?

612
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,648
 Well, it's obvious.

613
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,652
He doesn't want anyone
at the plant to know.

614
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,613
He said when I'm having
one of my spells, you know,

615
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,907
I should just stay in my room.

616
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,076
And I'm-- I'm
embarrassed, you know?

617
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,871
I feel ashamed.

618
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,667
 Mom, I have never been ashamed
of you, not even for a minute.

619
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,964
Even when you danced
with Benji Perkins

620
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,633
at my 12th birthday party.

621
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,510
 I did, didn't I?

622
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,430
Janet Jackson, Control.

623
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,850
I was a happening girl.

624
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,518
 You can remember that?

625
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,104
 Oh yeah, I just can't remember
what I had for breakfast.

626
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,236
I don't know what
I'm going to be like.

627
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,571
 So what?

628
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,823
 Aren't you scared?

629
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,241
 Your sister didn't
even want to let me

630
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,619
take the baby out for a walk.

631
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,246
 Well you know, I hit a
tree at 65 miles an hour.

632
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,958
So not a lot scares me.

633
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,792
Are you scared?

634
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,010
You know, I think that
if you could rely on dad

635
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,845
a little bit more,
maybe this other stuff

636
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,221
wouldn't be so scary to you.

637
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,224
 Your dad and I do just fine.

638
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,560
Now go to bed.

639
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,395
Go on.

640
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,815
 I'm not leaving while
you're still scared.

641
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,609
 Then I'm going to bed.

642
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,110
 OK, I'll go to bed.

643
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,529
 OK.

644
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,531
You always make me feel better.

645
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,407
Thank you.

646
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:01,334
[music playing]

647
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,992
 You want me to pick up
something for dinner tonight?

648
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,368
 I don't care.

649
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,036
 I'm running late.
I'll see you, then.

651
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,785
 Keys.

652
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,786
Watch.

653
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,287
Earrings.

654
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,872
Dog out.

655
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,623
Wallet.

656
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,126
OK.

657
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,493
 I got some take out.

658
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,411
 I had a long day.

659
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm not very hungry.

660
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:35,089
[clock ticking]

661
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,517

Keys.

663

Purse.

664
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,109
Earrings.

665
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,194
Wallet.

666
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:57,987
Dog.

667
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,216
 I'm going to put
you on new medication.

668
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:46,721
Hopefully you'll get some relief
from the most severe symptoms.

669
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,391
This medication seems
to be doing that.

670
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:55,354
It's had some good results
from people in your age group.

671
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,105
 My age group?

672
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,987
Are there a lot of
people in my age group?

673
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,322
 Not a lot.

674
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,576
 Some people?

675
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,705
I'd really like to talk to them.

676
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:17,585
 I don't know, Diane,
there are privacy issues.

677
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:23,841
 Well, I'd sure be willing
to give up some of my privacy

678
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:29,055
to have somebody I could
share this stuff with.

679
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,557
I bet you--

680
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,850
I bet you you'd
find at least some

681
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,518
of your patients who
feel the same way.

682
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:43,778
This Alzheimer's thing, it's
really isolating, you know?

683
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,154
People get lonely.

684
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,218
 Linda?

685
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,219
 Yes, hi.

686
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,512
 Hi.

687
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,222
 Thanks for coming
and meeting us here.

688
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,057
He really loves this place.

689
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,642
He never would have
come to your house.

690
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,685
 Oh, I like it here, too.

691
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,145
Is that him, there?

692
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,564
 Yes.

693
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,192
So, should I stay?

694
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,236
 No.

695
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,488
 I really appreciate
what you're doing, Diane.

696
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,490
Albert needs this.

697
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,535
To be honest, I need this.

698
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:36,080
So should I come
back about 3:00?

699
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,581
 I don't know, OK.

700
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,833
 OK.

701
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,834
Don't let him scare you.

702
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,296
 Hi.

703
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,094
I'm Diane McGowan.

704
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,012
We have the same
neurologist, Dr. Newman.

705
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,852
Your sister says
you like this place.

706
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,602
 Does she?

707
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,941
 I really like
coming here, too.

708
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,693
I used to bring my kids
here in the winter.

709
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,658
You want to go for a walk?

710
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,493
 It's your party.

711
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,704
 I'll just be quiet.

712
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,580
 Somehow I doubt that.

713
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,544
I taught history at
State University.

714
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:27,840
They tell me I spoke
four languages.

715
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,550
Times have changed.

716
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,428
Awhile ago I wandered away
and was gone for three days.

717
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,930
 Boy, I haven't done that yet.

718
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,640
 Ah, but do you know
that for certain?

719
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,022
I went through a
divorce, you see.

720
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,691
My wife left me when I
couldn't teach anymore.

721
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,526
I couldn't convince
her that tying my shoes

722
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,280
was an adequate substitute for
her tenure on the Arts Council.

723
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,282
 Boy, I'm sorry.

724
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,617
 Don't be.

725
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,076
She was right.

726
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,703
Who could blame her?

727
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,122
I'm resigned to dying from
this pernicious illness.

728
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,167
I only hope my
deterioration is rapid.

729
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,835
I'm thinking of taking
up smoking again,

730
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,797
eating lots of nitrates,
hasten the process.

731
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,634
 Look, you know, we
could change all that.

732
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,302
We could spend a lot
of time together.

733
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,553
We could take walks.

734
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,180
We could listen to music.

735
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,723
We could start our
own music society.

736
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,183
What kind of music do you like?

737
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,727
 17th century, earlier.

738
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,562
Luca Marenzio.

739
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,355
 Oh yeah?

740
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,863
 When I was gone, I
slept in a laundromat

741
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,491
with my sister's dog.

742
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:38,786
The dog never came home.

743
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,536
They never found him.

744
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,378
We seem to be in the
same sinking ship.

745
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:57,304
 Yeah, well, that
that's why I wanted

746
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,224
Dr. Newman to introduce us.

747
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:05,562
I was hoping maybe we
could help each other.

748
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,024
So, so is this OK with you?

749
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,235
Can we meet sometimes?

750
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,446
You want to be friends?

751
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,615
 Can't promise
I'll remember you.

752
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,325
 That's OK.

753
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,118
Then we'll start over.

754
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,755
ALBERT: Hello, Diane.

755
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,424
It's Albert Marelli.

756
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,718
I wanted to call
before I forget.

757
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,636
I would like to
get together again.

758
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,263
And for our music
society, I don't

759
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:43,350
mind listening to something
light like Alban Berg.

760
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,310
 Yes.

761
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,185
Alban Berg.

762
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,649
Get the ball, you all.

763
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,109
Get the ball, you all.

764
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,569
Get the ball, you all.

765
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,988
Get the ball, you all.

766
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,324
Yay, team.

767
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,199
 Hi.

768
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,534
 Hi.

769
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,285
 Casual Friday?

770
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,000
 Yeah, I got home early.

771
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,461
 Yeah, the heating
system broke down at work.

772
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,838
I about froze my buns off.

773
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,924
Thought we might
go out for Chinese.

774
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,094
I could use a little
hot and spicy.

775
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,388
 I can-- I can make dinner.

776
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,390
 I know you can.

777
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,851
I just thought it might
be nice for a change.

778
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,643
Just the two of us.

779
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,358
 OK.

780
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,651
 Good deal.

781
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,569
What time should I pick you up?

782
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,324
DIANE MCGOWIN: So
now he's living

783
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,785
with his sister and her family.

784
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,620
He's had it a lot
longer than I have.

785
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,873
Anyway, he was
diagnosed some time ago.

786
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,458
What I was thinking
was that we could

787
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,835
all get together for dinner
or something, you know?

788
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,295
You and me and Albert and--

789
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,090
and-- I forget her name.

790
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,050
 But I don't see the point.

791
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,803
 They're very
interesting people.

792
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:04,390
 But what would
we have in common?

793
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,476
 Hello, anybody home?

794
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,436
 Huh?

795
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,979
 I'll be right back.

796
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:11,814
I'm going to the ladies room.

797
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,428
 Are you OK?

798
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:45,097
 I don't know.

799
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:45,848
I don't know.

800
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,901
Where were you?

801
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,028
 I just went to get the car.

802
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,822
 You just left me there.
What did you do that for?

803
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,739
 I didn't leave you.

804
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,907
 You did it on purpose.

805
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,868
 Oh stop.

806
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:06,869
 Go, get out of here.

807
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:07,911
Go on.

808
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:12,249
I will-- just, get out of here.

809
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,210
Wait.

810
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,086
You bastard.

811
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,136
I don't know how to get home.

812
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,598
[car honking]

813
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:32,436
[music playing]

814
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,692
 So I sent out tons of e-mails
to all these neurologists all

815
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,486
across the Midwest
trying to convince them

816
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,154
to start support groups, right?

817
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,948
And I got an answer from this
one doctor in Minneapolis.

818
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,910
He wants me to come and talk
to some of his patients,

819
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,453
just for a couple of days.

820
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,748
But I don't know, you know,
Jack can't get off work.

821
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,249
And I don't know.

822
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,001
You think I should go alone?

823
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,419
 You'll go.

824
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,004
You'll fret about it.
You'll talk it to death.

825
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,339
But you'll go.

826
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,673
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

827
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,092
 Well, I could
lose it completely.

828
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,969
I could make a complete
fool of myself.

829
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,348
I could drool and fall on
my face and forget who I am.

830
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,183
 You don't drool.
Even I don't drool.

831
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,100
 How do you know?

832
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,769
Who would tell you?

833
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:14,686
 You would.

834
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,146
 I guess I would.

835
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,064
 Want some coffee?

836
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:17,940
 Oh yeah.

837
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,816
 Two coffees, please.

838
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,859
My treat today.

839
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,610
 Thank you.

840
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,073
 No, $40 for two coffees?

841
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,115
 Not enough?

842
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,158
- Much too much.
- You do it.

843
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,117
The bills all look alike to me.

844
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,496
 OK, I'll do the bills.

845
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,413
You have to do the coins.

846
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,206
I'm no good at coins.

847
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,878
Between the two of us, we
almost make a whole person.

848
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:40,671
 Thanks.

849
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,134
So this is it.

850
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,678
This is where I gave
my scintillating

851
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,639
lectures to several hundred
of Michigan's finest.

852
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,308
 It's so beautiful.

853
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,479
 I was known for my
one on one counsel.

854
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,941
My students meant
a great deal to me.

855
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,485
Mind you, that was when
I still had a heart.

856
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,988
 No more?

857
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,448
 Like, um, like--

858
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,037
who's that fellow
over the rainbow?

859
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,082
 Oh, the Tin Man.

860
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,877
 Absolutely empty in here.

861
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,296
 Scarecrow.

862
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:25,799
Just stuffing,
nothing but stuffing.

863
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,303
Hey, Albert, why don't you
come to Minneapolis with me?

864
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,762
 Are you out of your mind?

865
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,763
 Natch.

866
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,723
I got Alzheimer's, remember?

867
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,852
You could come, though.

868
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,895
You wouldn't get lost.

869
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,064
We can stay in the same room.

870
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,232
You should do it.

871
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,485
It's a chance to
make a difference.

872
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,447
Listen, if we can
find the airport,

873
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,740
we can have a swell time.

874
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,038
 We can't go to Minneapolis
that weekend because they got

875
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,539
me on the rotation schedule.

876
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,915
 What, you can't
get two days off?

877
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,375
 No, I tried.

878
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,210
Some of the guys are
still on winter vacation--

879
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,047
 It's OK, I'm
going with Albert.

880
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,840
- That's ridiculous.
- Why?

881
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,216
It's just for two days.

882
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,427
I think it'll be really
fun for both of us.

883
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,429
He's even worse off
than you are, isn't he?

884
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,347
 Well, how would you know?

885
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,265
You've never even met him.

886
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:19,269
 Because you're the one
that told us all about him.

887
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,021
 Dad, this is a
lot more important

888
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,606
than some guy's vacation.

889
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,066
Get off the schedule and go.

890
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,108
 Stay out of it.

891
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,485
It's got nothing to do with you.

892
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,820
 The doctors arranged
for the whole thing.

893
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,322
We're going to be picked
up at the airport.

894
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,657
We'll be driven all over town.

895
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,575
We'll be brought
back to the airport.

896
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,620
We'll be supervised the whole
time like good little kids.

897
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,955
 Mom, that's not what he meant.

898
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,707
 Give me a little
credit, will you?

899
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,086
 The answer is no.

900
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,714
 Did anyone hear
me ask a question?

901
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,590
I don't think so.

902
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,106
 Thank you, Mrs. McGowin.

903
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,607
Room 502.

904
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,735
 Oh, there isn't
any number on here.

905
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,530
 I know, it's a
safety precaution.

906
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,241
That way if you lose it, no
one knows what room it goes to.

907
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,992
 Not even us.

908
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,454
Would you mind just writing the
number in there for me please?

909
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,664
 And on his too?

910
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,007
 Thank you.

911
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,843
 I thought you said
we'd stay together.

912
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,469
 We are, but I
couldn't tell her that.

913
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,893
What are you doing?

914
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,311
 It's going to
be too difficult.

915
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,730
 What do you mean?

916
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,897
What are all these?

917
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,984
 The notes for my
speech tomorrow.

918
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,777
 You're not going to
give a lecture, Albert.

919
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,612
Nobody wants you
to give a speech.

920
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,697
 You have no right to do that.

921
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,781
 I wasn't I going to read them.

922
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,033
 Damn right, you weren't.

923
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,954
 Look, all you have to do is
just speak from your heart.

924
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,289
 I have no heart.

925
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,707
I told you, it was
the first thing to go.

926
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,459
 Of course you have a heart.

927
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,210
Think of your students.

928
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,087
Think of those students you took
out of that enormous classroom

929
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:09,963
and helped.

930
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,923
 Diane, I want silence.

931
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,508
 Yes, professor.

932
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,761
 I'm not speaking to your
little gathering tomorrow.

933
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,636
It's just not going to happen.

934
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:53,715
 Albert?

935
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,479
Albert?

936
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:30,919
Excuse me, sir, have
you seen Doctor Marelli?

937
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:36,550
He's about six feet tall
and he's wearing pajamas?

938
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,093
 No ma'am, I
haven't seen anyone.

939
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,011
No one's been down here
in quite some time.

940
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:40,762
 Thank you.

941
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,091
 This is a lovely hotel, but
you have to go so far to pee.

942
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,851
 One of the hardest
things for me right now

943
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,812
is that I can't
communicate with my family

944
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,939
at all, especially my husband.

945
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,568
You know, I try to tell him
what's going on with me and he

946
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,611
just--

947
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,820
it's like he doesn't believe me.

948
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,739
He just-- he doesn't hear me.

949
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,325
 Aren't you worried about what
your husband is going to do,

950
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,577
if he's going to stay with
you and take care of you

951
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,996
when you can't even
pick up a spoon anymore?

952
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,289
I mean, how is he
going to do that when

953
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,916
you can't get through to him?

954
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,126
 We can't be sure
anybody's going to do it.

955
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,755
And my sister has been
taking care of me.

956
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,132
And she's been wonderful.

957
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:04,095
But the other day she got
irritated and she said,

958
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,015
you told me that before.

959
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:10,477
And I knew from
that moment on, she

960
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,312
was not going to stick around.

961
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,355
 Why didn't he talk?

962
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,360
 Nobody has to talk.

963
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:23,698
 I have a heart, Diane.

964
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,458
 I know.

965
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:39,255
 In the beginning,
I was adrift,

966
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:45,845
in limbo, just nothingness.

967
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,098
And then you.

968
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,976
And then I came alive again.

969
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:55,480
That's when it all
began, when I met you.

970
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,275
 For me, too, that's
when it happened.

971
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,151
 Yes?

972
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:00,944
 Yes.

973
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,489
 That's it.

974
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:07,951
That's good.

975
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:10,870
That's it.

976
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:19,504
 I love what you
said this afternoon.

977
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,215
 What did I say?

978
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,176
 You don't know remember?

979
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,302
 Not a word.

980
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,053
Tell me.

981
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,642
 All the right things.

982
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,604
You said all the right things.

983
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,820
You know, we could--

984
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,572
we could work off
into the sunset

985
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,157
but we'd never
find our way back.

986
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,380
Jack?

987
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,674
 What?

988
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,426
Oh hi.

989
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,635
 Hi.

990
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,262
 You're back early.

991
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,057
 No, I'm right on time.

992
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,308
 You didn't call.

993
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:14,559
 Oh, sorry.

994
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,144
 Yeah, we were
worried about you.

995
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,020
 Oh.

996
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,563
 So how'd it go?

997
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:22,400
 It was wonderful, a lot
of really interesting people

998
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,359
to care about?

999
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,778
 How'd your friend make out?

1000
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:25,737
 Just fine.

1001
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,781
He was fine.

1002
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,616
 So you're glad you went, huh?

1003
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:31,701
 Yeah, I'm really glad.

1004
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,872
Yeah, there was-- there was
this interesting discussion.

1005
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,666
Everyone's talking about
who was going to take care

1006
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,127
of them, you know, when they--

1007
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,922
later when they
couldn't do it anymore.

1008
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,424
And so I was
thinking, you know, we

1009
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,384
should talk about
that because you know,

1010
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,679
someone's going to
have to brush my hair,

1011
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:58,603
feed me, brush my teeth,
wipe the drool off my chin.

1012
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,440
So who do you think
is going to do that?

1013
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,275
 Well you know,
maybe we can get

1014
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,028
a part time nurse or a
medical student or somebody

1015
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,613
like that, huh?

1016
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:14,953
 Yeah, well, I was
thinking more you know, a--

1017
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,788
about you.

1018
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:21,835
I was thinking, are you
going to be there, you know,

1019
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:26,005
to hold me when I
forget how to breathe?

1020
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,675
 What are you laying all this
on my now for, for God's sake,

1021
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,009
you just came through the door.

1022
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,052
 Well, I'd really like to know.

1023
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,679
I need to know.

1024
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,889
 But you're doing
great, aren't you?

1025
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:40,019
 Well, things are changing.

1026
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:44,649
I haven't been honest with you.

1027
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:48,153
I-- uh, I had to quit my job.
- What?

1028
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,364
 I haven't been going to work.

1029
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,532
 Since when?

1030
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,868
 Since awhile.

1031
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:55,743
I don't know.

1032
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,328
I wrote it down.

1033
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,165
 Oh, well, why didn't you
tell me, for God's sakes?

1034
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,585
I'm not the enemy, kid.

1035
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:06,421
 So-- so are you--
are you going to--

1036
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,672
are you going to
take care of me?

1037
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,845
 I'll try, OK?

1038
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:14,596
I'll try.

1039
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,143
Christ, I put the dog out and
I haven't fed him all day.

1040
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:31,154
[music playing]

1041
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,669
 Hi, it's so cold.

1042
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,462
What are you doing outside?

1043
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:55,511
Oh, are you having a bad day?

1044
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,554
I had one yesterday.

1045
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,140
Boy, I got lost and I was home.

1046
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,934
I couldn't find my own room.

1047
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,312
 This going to be one of
your nonstop talking days?

1048
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:07,106
 No.

1049
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,566
I just want to say one thing.

1050
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,653
I'm really glad we
went to Minneapolis.

1051
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:15,114
I wanted to thank you
for coming with me.

1052
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,824
You may not remember that
you did, but you did.

1053
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:17,617
And I'm grateful.

1054
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,548
So, you want to talk
about the university?

1055
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,260
The Civil War?
- No.

1056
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,302
No.

1057
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,220
 No?

1058
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,471
 No.

1059
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,932
No.

1060
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,769
 You want to tell me
who was Alban Berg was?

1061
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,687
How about that?

1062
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:46,437
I remembered the name.

1063
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,612
Well, we could go for a walk.

1064
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,863
I'd love to see some trees.

1065
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,032
You want to go to the arboretum?

1066
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,617
 You won't remember
how to get there.

1067
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,244
 I do, right now I do.

1068
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:05,081
[music playing]

1069
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:18,970
 See, I found it.

1070
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,401
Lucky for us they keep
all this alive right

1071
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:34,736
in the middle of the city.

1072
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,321
 Lucky for us.

1073
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,531
 Did I ever tell you about
my trees around the house

1074
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,158
I grew up in?

1075
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,576
Did I ever tell you about
the attic I used to play in?

1076
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:42,827
 No, I don't know.
Maybe.

1077
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,162
I don't care.
I don't want to hear.

1078
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,580
I don't want to hear.
- Oh but come one.

1079
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,956
It's really important
to talk to each other,

1080
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,708
especially when one
of us is feeling down.

1081
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,126
 Because you always
have to be the boss.

1082
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,878
You're always the
boss, every time.

1083
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,254
- What are you talking about?
- You pick the music in the car.

1084
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,589
You pick everything.
- You never complain.

1085
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:55,882
 You pick where we go.
You pick the days.

1086
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,467
I don't-- I don't
like Elvis Presley.

1087
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,760
I like, uh--
- Who, Al?

1088
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,094
Who do you like?
Tell me.

1089
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,804
Tell me all the names.

1090
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,514
Tell me all the names of all
the great composers, if you're

1091
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:04,640
so much better than I am.

1092
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,558
 Shut up.

1093
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,393
Bossy, bossy, bossy.

1094
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,311
Moller.

1095
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:10,897
I like Moller.

1096
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,273
Diane, come back.

1097
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,442
[bell ringing]

1098
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:39,944
 Albert?

1099
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,403
Albert.

1100
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:25,406
Oh, Albert.

1101
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,742
Oh, you're so cold.

1102
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,873
I'm sorry.

1103
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:34,749
I'm sorry.

1104
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:52,058
[doorbell rings]

1105
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,768
Hi how's he doing?

1106
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:56,354
I was hoping maybe I could take
him for a walk or something?

1107
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,980
 He's not doing very well.

1108
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,482
 Really?

1109
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,858
Could I-- could I
come in for a minute?

1110
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,860
We usually manage to
cheer each other up.

1111
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:07,740
 No, Diane, he's
not at home anymore.

1112
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,950
 Where-- where-- where--

1113
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,409
where is he?

1114
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:16,123
 Had a severe episode
and we had to put him--

1115
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,750
 In a hospital?

1116
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,501
 A facility.

1117
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:22,838
 You took him away?

1118
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,049
 It's a very good
care facility.

1119
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:25,967
 No.

1120
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,468
We don't need that.

1121
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,137
He-- he could-- he could
just come right out of it.

1122
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,305
 No, Diane.

1123
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,723
He's not going to
come out of it.

1124
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:36,435
He had absolutely
no idea who I was.

1125
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,604
 One day, just one day.

1126
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,647
You know?

1127
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:42,692
Tomorrow he could be just fine.

1128
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:46,821
Listen, Miss-- what's your name?

1129
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,155
 Linda.

1130
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,740
 Linda, maybe-- maybe
if you can't take

1131
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,866
care of him anymore
maybe he could

1132
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,618
come live at my house with me.

1133
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:53,995
He's better with me.

1134
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,163
 No, that's not possible.

1135
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,081
 Why not?

1136
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,332
Don't you love him?

1137
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,002
 Of course I love him.

1138
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,670
You knew this was
going to happen.

1139
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,629
We knew it would happen.

1140
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,798
We just didn't know when.

1141
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,716
I've done the best I could.

1142
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:07,508
I'm sorry.

1143
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,447
 I'm sorry about your friend.

1144
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,740
 Albert.

1145
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,825
His name is Albert.

1146
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,702
 Albert.

1147
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,037
You'll meet other people.

1148
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:38,080
It's not the end of the world.

1149
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,165
 It's the end of my world.

1150
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,713
Albert's gone and
I'm right behind him.

1151
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:51,385
I'm losing a little more
of myself every day.

1152
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,221
Pretty soon I won't even exist.

1153
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,057
 Come on, don't talk like that.

1154
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:02,146
I'll ask Sean to check in
on you later, all right?

1155
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,939
 No, don't ask him.

1156
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,066
Don't ask him anything.

1157
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,456
 Yeah, I could take care of it.

1158
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,416
Just make sure I get
all the paperwork, OK?

1159
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,251
 Who is that?

1160
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,795
 Uh, I got to go now.

1161
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,004
So I'll see you later.

1162
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,422
Bye bye.

1163
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,799
That was the night
shift foreman.

1164
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,759
I had to check in.

1165
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,260
 Liar.

1166
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,595
 I'm not lying.

1167
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:35,471
 It was Paula, wasn't it?

1168
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,764
 What?

1169
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,474
 I know you've been
talking to Paula.

1170
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,810
 Sure, I told you I was talking
to her about finding someone

1171
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,145
to come in a couple of times a
week and help out around here,

1172
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,480
keep an eye on things.

1173
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,856
 Things, keep an eye on things.

1174
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:46,732
 Stop it, Diane.

1175
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:47,775
This ain't funny.

1176
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,193
 I know the plan.

1177
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,236
 What plan?

1178
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,862
- You and Paula.
- Oh boy.

1179
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,781
 You're planning to put me
in a facility, aren't you?

1180
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,324
 I don't know what
you're talking about.

1181
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,534
 A facility.

1182
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,494
A facility.

1183
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,037
Before I get to be
a problem for you.

1184
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,580
 Don't be ridiculous.

1185
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,916
 Because I could tell you
right now, I'm not going.

1186
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,835
And I can tell you that
nobody is going to force

1187
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,253
you to go anywhere, sweetheart.

1188
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,504
But I got to go to work now.

1189
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,672
 Sure you do.

1190
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:10,715
You're such a liar.

1191
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,007
 Please.
This is getting old.

1192
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,259
 I'm onto you.

1193
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,719
 I can't take the
fighting anymore.

1194
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,095
 You're such a liar.
You're not going to work.

1195
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,638
 Well, this is the truth.

1196
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,556
I'm out of here.

1197
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,348
 Liar!

1198
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,605
I don't know you, lady.

1199
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,982
Get out of my house!

1200
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:12,902
 Anybody home?

1201
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,501
Yeah, Trace, it's dad.

1202
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:29,502
I just got in.

1203
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,295
Look, mom's car is not here.

1204
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,172
Is she over there?

1205
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,257
Nah.
Yeah, that's all right.

1206
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,425
Yeah, you're right.

1207
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,093
She probably told
me and I forgot.

1208
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,011
All right, thanks, love.

1209
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:39,762
Bye bye.

1210
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,384
I called Albert's
house but his sister

1211
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,762
told me they hadn't seen or
heard from her since yesterday.

1212
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,640
Do you know if Diane
had a key to her office?

1213
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,810
Well, I didn't think so.

1214
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,355
No, Jenny didn't know either.

1215
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,440
I called the police.

1216
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,608
They won't touch it.

1217
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:16,942
It's too early.

1218
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,278
I say it's too soon.

1219
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:20,613
Yeah.

1220
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,031
No, it's all right.

1221
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,532
Yeah, I will when I hear.

1222
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,325
Thank you, Paula.

1223
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:57,274
 Mom.

1224
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,738
Must have been so hard for you.

1225
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:11,246
Why didn't you tell me?

1226
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,465
We didn't have those
roller blade, things.

1227
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:45,841
We had these.

1228
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,010
I used to ride like the wind.

1229
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,095
There goes Diane,
they used to say.

1230
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,388
She's going to
crack her head open.

1231
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,444
I remember her.

1232
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,072
I remember this girl.

1233
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:54,118
She was fearless and loud.

1234
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:56,495
She had a big mouth, even then.

1235
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,371
I led all the sit-ins.

1236
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,001
You hear that, Albert?

1237
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,920
I never was the silent type.

1238
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:33,550
JACK: Diane?

1239
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,593
Diane, where are you?

1240
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,388
Hey, Scampy.

1241
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,265
How are you doing, kid?

1242
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,058
There you are.

1243
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:47,522
Well, it's been awhile.

1244
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:56,949
Come on, I'll help you down.

1245
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,205
- No.
- It's me, Jack.

1246
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,290
Don't be afraid.

1247
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,252
 I'm not afraid.

1248
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:14,383
I've been here a long
time, maybe a week.

1249
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,386
 No, just overnight

1250
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,596
 Really?

1251
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,640
 Just one night but I missed
you like it was a week.

1252
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,813
Come on.

1253
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:28,563
Let's go home, kid.

1254
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,278
 You can't just try.

1255
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,115
It's not enough.

1256
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,247
 I know.

1257
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,123
I'm going to take care of you.

1258
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,294
Whatever happens,
I'll be there for you.

1259
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,086
I promise.

1260
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:56,967
Hey, come on.

1261
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:08,103
You got to trust me, see.

1262
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,521
Because I heard you.

1263
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,481
And now I know what you
meant about being safe.

1264
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:15,527
 You did.

1265
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:16,945
You heard me.

1266
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:17,738
 Uh huh.

1267
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:23,660
 Jack.

1268
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:28,123
I'm not going to lose myself.

1269
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:35,213
I remembered who I am.

1270
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:40,093
No, whatever happens
to my mind or my body,

1271
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:43,638
who I am isn't going to go away.

1272
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:47,809
I'm not going to disappear.

1273
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:50,854
Still Diane.

1274
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:53,106
Diane with
Alzheimer's, but Diane.

1275
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:15,170
 I'll never forget you and
what you meant in my life.

1276
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:25,514
And even when you don't
know me, I'll know you.

1277
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:26,431
I promise.

1278
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,560
