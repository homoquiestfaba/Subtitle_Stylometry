[Father] That's why it's hard
for me to say this...

1119

for you to pay me what you owe.

I don't owe you shit.

1131

01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,916
- [Irv talking indistinctly]
- [woman laughs]

1238
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,333
[audience laughing]

1239
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:20,833
Why is he here?

1240
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:25,041
- Relax.
- No. Don't tell me to relax.

1241
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:30,000
I just wanted him
to come and hear me sing.

1242
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:32,541
Why?

1243
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:37,375
'Cause I told him I was a good singer,
and he didn't believe me.

1244
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,625
Is that the only reason you invited him?

1245
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,750
Yes.

1246
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,750
When this is all over...

1247
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:02,541
the only person
I wanna hear applauding is you.

1248
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:10,750
I would applaud for you
even if you fall flat on your face.

1249
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:12,333
I know.

1250
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:18,583
[knocks on door]

1251
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:22,041
Who is it?

1252
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:24,291
[man] It's time.

1253
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,416
[door opens]

1254
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,875

[somber music playing]

1256
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:03,791
...and she has this aura about her
that's magnetic.

1257
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:08,583
[Irv] <i>Yes. I was drawn to her right away
when I saw her perform the other night.</i>

1258
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:11,458
[woman]<i> Mm-hmm. I don't think
I've ever met someone quite like her.</i>

1259
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,541
She's

1260
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:16,875
<i>that kind of girl
that only comes along once in a lifetime.</i>

1261
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:19,041
<i>It's... If I can say,</i>

1262
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:22,541
<i>it's like God was showing off a little bit
when He made her.</i>

1263
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:26,125
<i>- </i>[Irv] <i>Sure.
- That He breathed it on her vocal cords...</i>

1264
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:32,708
<i>smiled when He made her spirit</i>

1265
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:35,500
<i>and laughed when He finished that face.</i>

1266
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:36,791
[Irv]<i> I would agree.</i>

1267
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:39,625
[both chuckle]

1268
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:43,833
[woman] <i>Yeah. I think, uh, she made...
He made something truly special.</i>

1269
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:46,333
[gentle music playing]

1270
01:26:57,458 --> 01:27:02,250
<i>Yeah, I... I just think
that she's gonna change all of our lives.</i>

1271
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,916
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Beauty.</i>

1272
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,708
