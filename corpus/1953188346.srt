00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,475
- Baden.

363
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,476
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,480
Beginnen.

365
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,739
- Beginnen.

366
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,658
I'll show you how far I got.

367
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,914
- "The vampire is prone
to be fascinated

368
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,333
"by particular persons.

369
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,544
"With an engrossing vehemence

it has satiated its passion

374
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,066
- Hello.

375
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,943
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

376
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,863
Here you go.

377
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,032
Please.

378
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,411
- Um, it's about Carmilla.
- Okay.

379
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,205
- If she's in love with Laura,

380
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,915
then why does she want
to destroy her?

381
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,583
- Well, I don't know
that she wants to destroy her.

382
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,001
She wants to control her.

383
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,295
The vampire's
a very lonely figure.

384
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,464
Carmilla wants a companion
in her existence.

385
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,967
She wants someone
to be all hers, forever.

386
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,637
- But why does Laura want
to be friends with someone

387
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,931
who's so obviously evil?

388
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,058
- I suppose she's been
hypnotized in some way.

389
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,727
Remember, the vampire needs
the consent of the victim.

390
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,397
- The vampire needs
the victim's consent?

391
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,149
- Yes-
well, in a way.

392
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,859
Remember, in Dracula,
he can only enter

393
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,694
if the victim
leaves the window open.

394
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,321
- It's Lucy's fault
for being such a weak person.

395
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,657
- Lucy?
- No, I mean Laura.

396
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,033
It's Laura's fault.

397
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,286
- Mm, in a way.

398
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,328
- Thank you.

399
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,413
It's been a big help.

400
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,837
Hey, Lu, do you have
the shoe polish?

401
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,088
Did you get new shoes?

402
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,924
I don't think those are allowed,
are they?

403
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,259
- These are Ernessa's.

404
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,969
- And why are you cleaning them?

405
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,721
- She doesn't know how.

406
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,514
She's never had to polish
her own shoes.

407
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,808
- It's really not that hard.

408
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,019
I'm sure she could do it
if she tried.

409
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,032
She never eats.
Have you noticed?

410
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,200
- What?

411
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,160
- Ernessa, she never eats
anything, ever.

412
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,453
- Maybe she's anorexic.

413
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,163
- Remember Annie Patterson
last year?

414
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,665
Her face looked like a skull,
and she still wouldn't eat.

415
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,834
- I just don't think
that'll ever be my problem.

416
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,294
- When you lose
that much weight,

417
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,879
your body can't even
keep itself warm,

418
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,672
and you begin to grow fuzz
all over your arms.

419
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,841
You can see it when they stand
against the light.

420
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,843
They call it "the glow."
Does Ernessa glow?

421
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,137
- No, and I don't think
she's starving herself.

422
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,306
Look at her.
She has a perfect body.

423
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,724
But if you think
she has anorexia,

424
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,768
you could just go up to her
and feel her arms.

425
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,187
- This is really fucking stupid.

426
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,150
- Sorry.
- Whoa.

427
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,443
- She's too sensitive.

428
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,945
- What a way to start a morning.

429
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,788
Do you think Ernessa's
hooking up with someone

430
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,872
at Langley College?

431
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,040
- A boy?
No way.

432
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,500
- She's slipping out at night.

433
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,542
- What do you mean?

434
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,002
- I heard her door open
last night.

435
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,170
And she didn't come back in,

436
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,005
at least not until after
I fell asleep.

437
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,006
- Really?

438
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,091
- It's happened before too.

439
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,259
- Weirdo.

440
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,677
Maybe she goes out to score.

441
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,428
- In the middle of the night,
go into town?

442
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,805
- Let's follow her.

443
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,890
See where she goes,
what she gets up to.

- Can you see anything?

446
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,311
- I don't know.

447
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,354
- It's fucking freezing.

448
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,190
What does Ernessa do out here?

449
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,817
- She watches us sleep.

450
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,413
Hey, you know when you see
the school from here,

451
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,164
you can totally imagine
what it looked like

452

- When I see the school
from here,

00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,171
I think about how easy
it would be

456
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,008
to just walk out.

457
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,677
- Well, I don't see Ernessa,
and it's cold.

And Mrs. Rood needs to see you
in her study now.

- How can she give
wardrobe advice?

It's like we're in,
like, duty.

470
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,360
- When I was a little girl,

471
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,736
the farmers said that
a nosebleed

472
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,530
was a sign of good luck.

473
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,618
You really shouldn't be sad

474
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,953
about these
cheap, sentimental things.

475
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,831
I feel like sweeping them all
into a pile on the floor.

00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,041
- That's cruel.

477
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,667
Mrs. Rood lost her husband.

478
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,795
She needs these things
to go on living.

479
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,049
- I don't need things
to remember my father.

480

Before Ernessa came here,
I was getting better.

484
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,707
I was happy.

485
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:46,006
Now all the darkness
has come flooding back.

486
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:50,719
It's like she's invading
my mind.

487
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,264
Even when I'm alone,
I can't escape her.

488
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:01,605
There's this disgusting smell
that comes from her room:

489
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,442
sickly sweet but rotten.

490
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,194
Why doesn't anyone else
notice it?

Lucy?

492
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,038
I haven't seen you all day.
Where have you been?

493
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,500
- I was busy.

494
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,960
Why did you complain
to Mrs. Rood

495
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,211
about Ernessa's room?

496
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,713
- Lucy, it's right across
the hall from me,

497
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,047
and it smells really bad.

498
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,175
- I thought you would be more
sensitive, considering.

499
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,384
- Considering what?

500
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,720
- Her dad killed himself.

501
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,516
- I didn't know.

502
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,727
- I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

503
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,450
- November 9th.

504
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,619
His last day on Earth.

505
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,458
Lucy didn't remember.

506
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,959
She never said anything.

507
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,129
We spent it together
last year.

508
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,555
- What's your favorite memory
of your father?

509
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,890
Let's think about that.

510
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,271
- If I had to pick one moment,

511
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,608
it would be the night we saw
the Luna moth.

512
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,948
- Look.

513
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,950
There.

514
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,201
You see it?

515
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,372
I've never seen a moth
like that before.

516
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,177
- The Luna moth was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

517
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,934
Why weren't those things
enough for him?

518
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:09,817
"A person may become a vampyre
if he dies unseen."

519
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,696
My father
wanted to die unseen,

520
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,824
like an animal who wants
to curl up and die alone.

521
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,497
- Don't feel bad
about your father.

522
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,668
Some of the greatest artists
went mad or committed suicide.

523
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:33,007
Some people find great joy
in the prospect of death.

524
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,925
Just thinking about it
can be a comfort,

525
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:40,097
like lying in your bed
and pulling up the covers.

526
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:45,060
The moment of death
is ecstatic.

527
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,939
It's the most joyful sensation.

528
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,109
You're being born into
a new existence.

529
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,597
- Is my father's illness
in my blood too?

530
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,729
I wonder when he did it.

531
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,398
How much did it hurt?

532
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,070
And did it really
take the pain away?

00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,265
- Dora fell.

720
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,101
She must have fallen.

721
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:19,147
She went out there again
and slipped just like I did.

722
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,982
Ernessa didn't walk
through glass.

723
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,068
She couldn't.

724
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,486
The window
must have been open.

725
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,238
It was dark.

726
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,035
I won't let myself believe
things I know aren't possible.

727
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,038
[bell tolling]

728
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,007
Hi.

729
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,718
- Hi.

730
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,221
- Did you come in by train?

731
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,640
- My mom gave me a lift.

732
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,682
- How was your-

733
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,227
- I got to return these
to the library.

734
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,145
- Wait.
Lucy, wait, please.

735
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,523
I'm sorry.

736
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,899
Last term, I just-

737
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,027
I guess I just got so jealous
of you and Ernessa.

738
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,614
I think I went a little-

739
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,783
I don't know.

740
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,784
Crazy.

741
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,412
I'm sorry.

742
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,663
- It's okay.

743
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,872
These things happen.

744
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,625
- No, it's not okay.

745
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,168
It's my fault about Dora.

746
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,711
I made her go up on the roof.

747
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,672
- Rebecca,
we all went up there.

748
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,924
You can't beat yourself up
over this.

749
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,509
- I've just been so stupid.

750
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,345
I-I hated being jealous.

751
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,639
I never want to feel
like that again.

752
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,769
- I didn't want to stop
being friends with you.

753
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,896
It's just that you wouldn't give
Ernessa a chance.

754
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,191
- I've missed you so much.

755
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,029
- I missed you too.

756
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,031
- [chuckles]

757
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,203
- Let's just start over
and pretend like last term

758
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,371
never even happened.

759
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,664
- Yeah.

760
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,291
It feels like
a bad dream anyway.

761
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,629
- But you have to be friends
with Ernessa.

762
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,091
We were just talking
about you,

763
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,510
how we should all
do something together.

764
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,721
- Yes.
Let's.

765
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,265
- Maybe Sunday, we can all
go into town or something.

766
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,308
- We could go to the movies.

767
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,309
- I would love that.

768
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,312
Oh, Sunday...

769
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,897
I booked two horses
to go riding.

770
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,898
- Oh...

771
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,065
- Can you ride?

772
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,902
- No.

773
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,153
I never took lessons.

774
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,155
- We'll have to think
of something else.

775
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,156
We'll make a plan.

776
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,908
- We will for sure.

777
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,912
- I'm sorry about Sunday.

778
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,664
But we're going to spend
a lot of time together

779
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,874
very soon.

780
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,210
We have so much in common.

781
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,428
- "I heard a fly buzz
when I died.

782
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,305
"But the stillness in the room

783
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,724
"was like the stillness
in the air,

784
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,976
between the heaves of storm."

785
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,978
It's as if she's taking you
moment by moment

786
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,314
through the experience
of dying.

787
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,275
Okay, on that cheerful note,

788
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,611
thank you very much, ladies.

789
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,784
Uh, Rebecca?

790
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,619
I have something to show you.

791
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,795
It's a first edition
of your father's book.

792
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,755
You know, I have to tell you,
I so admire

793
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,174
the way your father kept writing
and working all those years.

794
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,968
- The bank?

795
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,302
- Yes, the bank.

796
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,346
- I think he kind of liked
having a real job.

797
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,931
- You know,
I try to write at night,

798
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:45,103
but there's marking papers,
and there's preparation.

799
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,980
I don't know.

800
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,816
Sometimes I just feel my life
slipping away.

801
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,987
- You know, with my dad,

802
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,572
it feels like
all the bad stuff happened

803
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,740
when he was able to stay home
all day and write.

804
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,410
- I will take that
as my inspiration.

805
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,329
He really is my hero,
you know.

806
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,415
- Mr. Davies?
- Yes?

807
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,749
- I need your supply list.

808
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,418
- Of course, uh-
- Thank you.

809
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,087
- I was just showing Rebecca
here this-this book.

810
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,297
It's her father's.

811
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,173
very rare.

812
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,758
- Bye.

813
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,060
- Hey, are you joining
basketball?

814
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,854
- I'm not going to do sports
this term.

815
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,938
It's too tiring.

816
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,981
- Why are you so tired?

817
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,274
You know,
you should eat more.

818
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,276
- I do eat.
I eat all the time.

819
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,861
- I don't see you
at breakfast anymore.

820
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,362
- I'm not hungry
in the morning.

821
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,906
- You don't seem very hungry
at dinner either.

822
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:42,243
- It's okay, Mom.
I'm fine.

823
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,121
- Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,956
I'll back off.

Where have you been?

828
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,721
- I couldn't get up
this morning.

829
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,014
I slept right through
the bell.

830

- I see that Caroline Wallis
and Lucy Blake

831
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,478
were late for assembly.

832
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,314
You will report for detention
after classes.

Ernessa Bloch
has missed gymnastics

834

for the fourth week
in a row.

835
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,156
She will report to Miss Bobbie
to make up these classes.

makes Ernessa swim laps

838
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,036
It's so unfair.

839
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,413
It's like torture for her.

840
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,252

if you want us to.

- So how was it?

I did before.

I'm not in love with him.
