to hippie parents in
the winter of 1962

in New York hospital,

15
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:15,684
and I'm getting
married in nine days.

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,122
As a result, I've been doing
quite a lot of thinking,

17
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,081
which people tell me is normal.

I don't know,

is an additional glow.

39
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,734
About five minutes ago.

couldn't get any better.

41
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:08,911
Yeah, well come on, we're
going to be very late.

00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,440
Are you going to be
able to fit into that?

more importantly,

00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,191
of course, I'm going to
fit into that wedding dress

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,456

and although it's

glibly and superficially

I am committed

to solving and destroying,

61
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,047
because I refuse to let
it fuck up my life anymore

62
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,267
and that problem is very
simply that I'm a man.

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,920
I am stink-man!

64
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:05,881
As a man, I'm at
constant war with myself.

65
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,579
One side says, look,
you're 36 years old.

66
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,712
You've been around the
block, experienced life.

67
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,062
How lucky are you that now,

68
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:15,064
at the perfect time
to settle down,

69
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,371
God has graced you with
the most beautiful,

70
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:20,156
funny, smart, warm,
compassionate,

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,115
loving woman you
could ever wish for?

72
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,465
Thank you, God.

73
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:25,596
Thank you, God.

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,294
Thank you.

75
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,948
Now the other side says,

76
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,994
you see that sexy redhead

77
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,648
at that table across
the restaurant?

78
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,476
Why don't you get the
waiter to slip her a note,

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,434
telling her to meet you in
the bathroom in five minutes.

80
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,828
You get up, your heart racing.

81
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:40,655
You glance over to her.

82
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:41,917
She reads the note.

83
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,614
Will she tell the
guy she's with

84
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:44,398
and he'll come over and
beat the shit out of you?

85
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,225
Will she show up?

86
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,530
And what'll happen?

87
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:47,488
You go into the bathroom
and shut the door,

88
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,315
but you don't lock it.

89
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,793
Anyone could come in.

90
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,405
Some fat, drunk
businessman, a bus boy.

91
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:54,059
Then this might very
possibly even be illegal.

92
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,365
The door knob turns.

93
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,019
It's her.

94
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,281
She slides in and you
lock the door behind her.

95
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,761
You hoist her up on the sink.

96
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,328
She has one stiletto
on the toilet basin

97
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,373
and the other one on
your chest for leverage.

98
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,070
You slide her silk
panties to the side

99
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,420
and fuck the shit out of her.

100
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,292
Now, granted,

101
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,294
maybe nothing even remotely
like that has ever happened,

102
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,817
but you know what?

103
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,341
It might.

104
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:15,559
Okay.

105
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,995
It might.

106
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:21,303
Hi, honey.

107
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,697
How's it going?

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,785
Do you want some tea?

109
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,530
I'm in here now.

110
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,227
I realize that, sweetheart,

111
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,881
and I was wondering if
while you were in here,

112
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,186
you might like a cup of tea.

113
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,147
I understand.

114
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,803
It's just that it's really hard

115
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,762
to have any alone,
private time in here

116
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,722
when you keep coming in to where

117
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,376
I have my alone private time.

118
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,161
Look, it's no big deal.

119
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,380
I was just making
myself some tea

120
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,120
and I thought maybe
you'd like some.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,525
I really appreciate
how thoughtful you are

122
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,831
and how considerate you are,

123
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,963
and how you think of
making me a cup of tea

124
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,225
when you're making a cup of tea.

125
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:19,536
It's super sweet, but
I do have a beverage

126
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:22,539
and it's just,

127
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,328
it's really hard to
have any kind of just,

128
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,332
alone, private time,

129
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,859
when you keep coming in here,

130
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,427
to where I,

131
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,909
where I have my
alone, private time.

132
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,569
Can I ask you a question?

133
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:54,832
Prefer if you didn't.

134
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,617
Actually it's two questions.

135
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,574
Would it be okay
if you asked me

136
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,141
neither of them right now?

137
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:01,230
First, and I'm just curious,

138
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,581
why do you have your alone
private time in the bathroom,

139
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,323
and two, I want you to have it,

140
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,326
but could you maybe
find a different place

141
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,024
than our only bathroom
to have it in?

142
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,551
Do you need to go to
the bathroom right now?

143
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:20,423
No?

144
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,206
Shower, bath?

145
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:24,253
Is there any reason you
need to be in here now

146
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,297
because I'll go.

147
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,039
You have any thing here?

148
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:29,693
The sink, anything?

149
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,042
No.

150
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,044
So no reason why you
need to be in here now?

151
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,439
Okay, then in that case,
who cares if I'm in here?

152
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,310
Here's where I want to have
my own alone, private time.

153
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,964
So maybe tomorrow
it'll be over there

154
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,792
and then it'll be there
and there and there

155
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:44,316
but for now I want
to have it here.

156
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,143
Okay, so!

157
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,627
Maybe if we had a sign.

158
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,108
That's a good idea.

159
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,849
We'll put a sign on the door.

160
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,634
Alone time happening now.

161
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,332
Just nobody be here.

162
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,292
Oh, I have a better sign.

163
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:04,032
Tabitha!

164
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,512
No, no, no.

165
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,514
I'm feeling nervous about
marrying my great girlfriend

166
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:10,038
and because of that I'm
being kind of an asshole

167
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,822
when she's just
being thoughtful.

168
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,258
Come on, I'm not joking.

169
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,303
Oh, neither am I.

170
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:15,826
Come on, it's a better sign!

171
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,352
We'll get new papers
and markers and stuff,

172
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,224
and we'll put up some signs.

173
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,573
Okay.

174
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:37,500
Wirey!

175
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,851
Wirey!

176
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,463
Open the door, you asshole!

177
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,249
Open the fucking door!

178
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,600
Open this fucking door!

179
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,472
Wirey!

180
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,345
Wirey!

181
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,695
Open the door please.

182
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,349
1969.

183
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:03,308
The bathroom door sticks
if you close it tight.

184
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,484
Maybe I'll never get out.

185
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,269
Who cares?

186
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,271
My mother will never get in.

187
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,359
Wirey!

188
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:11,360
Wirey!

189
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,623
Will you open the door please?

190
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,804
Wirey, will you open the
door please, right now!

191
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,372
Wirey, open this god
damn door right now!

192
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,156
I was always so lonely,

193
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,724
but when I was locked in the
bathroom playing my guitar,

194
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,465
then I was safe.

195
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,730
I'd play Beatles songs, but
my fingers were too small,

196
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,165
so I couldn't do it right.

197
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,955
I can't remember the next cord.

198
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,480
Idiot, G not D!

199
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
G!

200
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,351
Play a G!

201
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,397
Give me a G.

202
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,877
Play the G.

203
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,357
Yes.

204
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,534
Start at the beginning.

205
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,886
At least Time Square
was mine.

206
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,018
It would always love me.

207
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,545
The noise and the scum.

208
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,808
The neon dancing
girls would hold me.

209
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,594
They didn't think
I was an idiot.

210
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,016
I would sit in the kitchen,

211
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,540
facing the Hudson River
from the 13th floor,

212
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,194
my feet up on the window sill.

213
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,459
The river, the chilly autumn
air, the cold red wine,

214
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,722
and Rubber Soul on the
cheap mono turntable.

215
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,725
This was my Haven.

216
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,422
This was my mother.

217
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,641
It's my first memory.

218
00:09:58,685 --> 00:09:59,468
I'm seven.

219
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,385
Actually, I guess
my very first memory

220
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,995
was trying to
practice cunnilingus

221
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,736
on the electric socket

222
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,433
and getting blown across
the room when I was a baby,

223
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,871
but after that, it's
the window sill,

224
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,047
the red wine and first grade.

225
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,528
I'm in love with
three women primarily.

226
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,356
A Chinese girl named Annie.

227
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,881
My blonde haired teacher.

228
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:25,929
I forget her name, Miss,
Caca-cowa-laska, something,

229
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,323
and Brooke Swarthen.

230
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,457
Hi Brooke, I brought you this.

231
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,111
Red Hots and
Peanut Butter Cups.

232
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,504
I brought you these.

233
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,246
Oh Greg, Devil
Dogs and Yodels.

234
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,685
My main present is 57 cents.

235
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,426
Oh, thank you, Wirey.

236
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,601
Where'd you get that?

237
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,733
Bus money, sucker!

238
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,474
Brooke was cagey.

239
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,651
She'd accept our presents,
then reject us both.

240
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,654
She would tell the
candy store guy

241
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,307
she'd bought too much candy

242
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:58,222
and sell the poor guy
back his own candy

243
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,442
that we'd just stolen
to give to her.

244
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,139
She was the only
girl in first grade

245
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,402
who got to go to Bermuda
for spring break.

246
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,276
Even though I knew
Brooke's scam,

247
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,714
the thrill of the conquest
kept me coming back for more.

248
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,411
Unlike Greg, however,

249
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,065
it did not render
me stupid enough

250
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,414
to give her my Yodels.

251
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,505
First off came the
beautiful tinfoil wrapping.

252
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,508
I would eat all
the chocolate off

253
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,642
being careful not to bite
into the next layer of cake.

254
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,774
This was crucial.

255
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,474
After the main log was bare,

256
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,564
I'd bite each end off and
then unravel the thing,

257
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,741
eating the chocolatey
cake layer as I went

258
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,656
until I got to the grand prize,

259
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:46,096
the dense chocolate cream
cake inner thin log,

260
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,581
and then,

261
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,242
cold milk 'til the headache.

262
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,722
Perfection.

263
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,506
This was the orgasm.

264
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,377
I must say that to this day,

265
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:09,816
that sublime experience
doesn't dare rival sex,

266
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:10,642
but who knew then?

267
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:11,731
I hadn't had sex yet.

268
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:16,692
The Yodels made me feel better
and restored my confidence.

269
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,607
Hi.

270
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,521
Hi Wirey.

271
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,784
I was wondering, well.

272
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,525
What, Wirey?

273
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:29,836
I was wondering if you
wanted to go to the auditorium?

274
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,883
Oh, you want to go
to the auditorium!

275
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,845
I guess she never accepted
second position behind Brooke.

276
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,412
She would twist
my arm 'til I cry,

277
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:44,198
but eventually if I
could stick it out,

278
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:47,375
she would grant me a make-out
session in the auditorium.

279
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,333
My right arm, a little mangled,

280
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:52,075
making attempts at second
base kind of rough.

281
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:55,035
I had a whole nother set
of friends in my building.

282
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:57,167
If the girls at school
wouldn't put out,

283
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,212
there was Slingon,

284
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,779
a French boy who didn't mind

285
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,998
if I pissed on him
from time to time,

286
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,566
Dave who I once made
put his mouth on it,

287
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:13,227
and Billy who would let me do
pretty much everything else

288
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,011
Slingon and Dave
wouldn't let me do.

289
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,233
What's going on
under there, boys?

290
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:21,670
Nothing Mom, just
playing a game.

291
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:22,497
Okay.

292
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,196
Between giving
golden showers,

293
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,720
getting head and
riding the purple pony,

294
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,158
I had more risque gay
sex before I was seven

295
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,639
than a lot of gay men have
in their entire lives.

296
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:37,164
So basically I'd
completed my training,

297
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,774
and was ready
for the real thing.

298
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,689
Full on sex with a girl.

299
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,996
I desperately wanted
to fuck my stepmother,

300
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,086
but being 30 years older
and married to my dad,

301
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,914
well, it just wasn't practical.

302
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,351
So I utilized the
second best option,

303
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,570
Thanksgiving with my cousins.

304
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,530
I wasn't allowed to kiss or hug

305
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,793
Betsy hello or goodbye anymore,

306
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,275
and I think it was
like no TV for a week.

307
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,711
I got off pretty cheap.

308
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:03,973
I don't know.

309
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:05,453
I just started not
getting along

310
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,716
with authority figures anymore.

311
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,414
Maybe it's because I had
finally achieved my manhood

312
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,808
and I needed my
adult independence.

313
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,870
What are you doing?

314
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,307
Men drink beer and
watching football on Sunday.

315
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,711
My acting out increased
at home, and at school.

316
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
Thank you for
coming, Mrs. Spindell.

317
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:54,894
We appreciate it.

318
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,855
I don't quite know
how to put this,

319
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,860
but Wirey seemed to
have missed the toilet

320
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:06,906
a little while ago.

321
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,908
We were concerned.

322
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,433
He missed the toilet.

323
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,825
Yes, Mrs. Spindell.

324
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,354
He peed on the floor?

325
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,925
I'm afraid he
defecated on the floor.

326
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:33,715
Well, how far off was he?

327
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:41,331
Wirey, would you like to beat
the bed with a tennis racket

328
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,767
to get out some of your anger,

329
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,512
instead of shitting on
the floor at school?

330
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,825
I hate school!

331
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,568
I hate my mother!

332
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:03,310
I hate everything!

333
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,103
Why don't you try it, Wirey?

334
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,236
It works.

335
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:17,889
It's helpful.

336
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:23,025
Would you rather play tug
of war with the towel?

337
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,338
Alright then.

338
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,647
No TV, no football for a week.

339
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,269
What are you doing, Wirey?

340
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,184
I told you not to
leave this house!

341
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:39,101
Wirey, don't you
leave this house!

342
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,843
But at least Raphael cares.

343
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,672
He's a strange mangy
Puerto Rican doorman

344
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,414
who always looks like he's
been in the mail room,

345
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,807
jerking off to kiddie
porn, half drunk.

346
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,287
Wirey.

347
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,114
Wirey.

348
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,684
What's wrong, Wirey?

349
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,381
Nothing, Raphael.

350
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,253
Come over here, I want
to show you something.

351
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:01,558
Not today, Raphael.

352
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,125
You're the best guy
here, you know that?

353
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,692
I never seen nobody
like you before.

354
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,041
You're the best guy here.

355
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,323
Where are you going?

356
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:29,456
I'm running away.

357
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,719
Okay.

358
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:32,807
Have fun.

359
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:41,772
I leave.

360
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,209
I have no place to go.

361
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,298
It's cold at night in New York.

362
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,430
Luckily my guardian
angel appears

363
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,171
so I know I'll be all right.

364
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,739
She's this weird thin
woman in a trenchcoat

365
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,393
who walks up and down Broadway

366
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,351
eating nuts out of a baggie.

367
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,788
I've seen her every
day for 30 years.

368
00:18:58,398 --> 00:18:59,964
Come out
of school in seventh grade,

369
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,053
she's there.

370
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,448
I run in the
park, she's there.

371
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,147
And then one day
last week I was at

372
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,583
a fruit stand on Broadway

373
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,280
and suddenly I was
face-to-face with her.

374
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,022
She just gave me this
funny little smile

375
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,894
as if to say, I'm your angel.

376
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:17,982
I'm here.

377
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:19,680
You don't need to worry,

378
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,162
then she just turned
and marched away again.

379
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,167
They say that God watches
over kids and drunks.

380
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,560
Well, I was a drunk kid.

381
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,868
Luckily, I got a
lot of watching.

382
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,093
I love being here
when I'm not supposed to be.

383
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:04,377
This place does
what I want it to

384
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,161
when I'm the only
one who is here.

385
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,554
Brooke likes me.

386
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,686
The Chinese girl
doesn't twist my arm.

387
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,384
My mother loves me.

388
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,820
I don't shit on the floor.

389
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,264
Back so soon.

390
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,702
What's the matter,
running away was no fun?

391
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,010
You're a fucking asshole.

392
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,533
What did you say
to me young man?

393
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,317
You're a fucking asshole.

394
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,622
I hate you!

395
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,189
I will not be talked
to that way, Wirey!

396
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,713
Wirey, open this door!

397
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:37,671
I hate you.

398
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:39,020
You're a fucking asshole.

399
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,804
Open this door,
Wirey Spindell!

400
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,284
Did you hear what I said?

401
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,981
I'm your mother and
you do as I tell you.

402
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,288
Open this door right now!

403
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,115
Wirey!

404
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:49,335
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,903
Open the door and
stop this, please.

406
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:55,645
Wirey.

407
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,126
Wirey!

408
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:58,866
Open this door!

409
00:20:58,909 --> 00:20:59,997
I hate you.

410
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,868
You're a fucking asshole.

411
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,043
Fuck you!

412
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,131
Fuck you!

413
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,888
My mother had
a rough childhood.

414
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,064
She got locked in
closets and abandoned

415
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:25,414
on street corners by her father.

416
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,895
I once found her
crying in her room.

417
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:30,071
I'd forgotten to get
her a birthday present.

418
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:33,248
Her mother had sent
her a roll of dimes.

419
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,205
It was the first
present her mother

420
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:37,034
had sent her in 30 years.

421
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,340
How the hell was I
supposed to know?

422
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,950
I was only eight.

423
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,996
All I knew was I
wanted her to love me.

424
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,739
Good
evening everyone.

425
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:48,524
This is Marv Albert speaking
from Madison Square Gardens.

426
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:51,962
At least Marv was
there and the Knick game.

427
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:55,052
He talked to me with more
interest than my father did.

428
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,054
I love Marv Albert.

429
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,013
The New York Knicks
and the Los Angeles Lakers.

430
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:03,017
Game number seven in the
World Series of basketball.

431
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,280
Bill Bradley, Dave DeBuscher,

432
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,197
Walt Frazier, Willis Reed,
Dick Barnett, Dave Stallworth.

433
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,417
These were my Knicks.

434
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,201
Everybody in
the house looking for

435
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:16,204
Willis Reed, Willis is not
taking part in the warm-up,

436
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,514
and Frankie Blouse, John, on
the public address to the press

437
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:25,387
just made an announcement
that I did not catch.

438
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,868
Let's see, it's
being written out.

439
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,913
Reed will start.

440
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,741
He will start the ball game.

441
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:35,136
He just received
another injection.

442
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,009
If all heads here at
Madison Square Garden turn

443
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:42,230
toward the area in which
the Knicks and Lakers

444
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,797
take the court

445
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,625
The Knicks are warming
up without Willis Reed,

446
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,453
but Willis will play although

447
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:50,325
the crowd here at the
Garden doesn't know it yet..

448
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:52,980
Coach told him
he couldn't play,

449
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:55,069
but Willis was gonna play.

450
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:59,160
And you can throw
out all previous performance.

451
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,118
Now the crowd rises!

452
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,077
Here comes Willis Reed.

453
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,256
Making his way from the
area out on the court.

454
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,782
Willis is receiving
a standing ovation.

455
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,915
Takes the ball and he jumps

456
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,699
and it hits the rim and
it falls to the right.

457
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:19,746
Now Willis will take part
in a pre-game warm-up.

458
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:24,620
Willis with a 26.8 average
against the Lakers.

459
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:29,190
Willis is getting a
tremendous standing ovation!

460
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,979
Waits before continuing
with the introduction.

461
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,677
He jumps in
against Chamberlain

462
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,505
and scores the first
four points of the game.

463
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,681
New York is a storybook.

464
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,422
I live in fairy tale.

465
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,076
The Knicks are the
champions in 1970.

466
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,340
Marv and I share this moment
as the garden is chaos.

467
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,559
This is my father.

468
00:23:50,603 --> 00:23:52,256
This is my dad.

469
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,274
Wirey?

470
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:12,189
Wirey?

471
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,627
Wirey?

472
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,066
Yeah, I know it's
a alone, private,

473
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,285
I'm nervous, great
girlfriend, marriage time,

474
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:25,812
but we're going to be late
for our appointment, hun.

475
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:27,988
I do actually
have one other

476
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:29,990
rather weighty problem
besides being a man.

477
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,255
I can't seem to make
love with women I love.

478
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,822
After the whole falling
in love thing is over

479
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,214
and we really know each other

480
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:38,564
and the love is
based on real things,

481
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,609
I just can't seem to do it.

482
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,698
Tabitha and I hadn't
had sex in nine months

483
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,831
and the wedding was
now three days away.

484
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:46,223
She said she appreciated

485
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,181
that I had been
working on my problem

486
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:48,661
diligently for many years

487
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:51,141
and didn't want to add
any unneeded pressure,

488
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,578
but that I had 72
hours to fix the thing

489
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,405
or the wedding wasn't
going to happen.

490
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,885
I didn't want to
go to her shrink

491
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:56,886
and she didn't want
to go to my shrink.

492
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,887
So her shrink suggested a woman

493
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,454
who was supposed to be great.

494
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,281
Roxanne.

495
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,634
Oh my God.

496
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,331
Wirey.

497
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:10,378
Oh my God!

498
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,208
Honey, this is Roxanne.

499
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,864
This is my father's ex-wife,

500
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:21,345
my ex stepmother's,
ex lover, Roxanne.

501
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:25,349
Roxanne, Tabitha.

502
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:27,961
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Tabitha.

503
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:28,788
Hi.

504
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,143
So what's the problem?

505
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,293
It's so beautiful,
isn't it honey?

506
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:58,469
It is, it is so beautiful.

507
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:13,833
What?

508
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,314
You want to fuck that girl?

509
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,926
Excuse me?

510
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,232
Oh, don't make this
worse and insult me

511
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,017
by pretending that you
weren't just mentally

512
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,323
having that girl suck your
dick behind the bushes

513
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,630
while everyone else is
harmlessly walking by.

514
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,204
Okay, let me get this right.

515
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,641
You're not now only accusing me

516
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,425
of wanting to fuck
the other girls,

517
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,079
but you're actually
inventing my fantasy

518
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,385
of the actual event as well?

519
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,082
Oh, do not confuse
the issue, Wirey.

520
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:47,736
Admit it, you wanna
fuck the girl!

521
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,086
No, I don't.

522
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:53,960
Did you see the girl?

523
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:54,917
Can you admit that?

524
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,835
What, that girl
in the weird glasses

525
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:00,662
that just walked by?

526
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:01,620
Yeah.

527
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,621
So, you admit that you saw her?

528
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,361
You admit that you noticed her?

529
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:06,712
Yeah, sure I noticed her.

530
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,278
I notice a lot of things.

531
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:11,368
I noticed those kids
over there playing.

532
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,414
I noticed people walking.

533
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:14,371
I noticed the trees.

534
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:15,938
I noticed the buildings.

535
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:17,636
Okay well, let's say
that you were sitting here

536
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,464
with your friends and
that girl walks by.

537
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,422
What would you say?

538
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:27,994
What?

539
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,300
Let's say that you were
here with Spike and Robbie

540
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,216
and the girl walks by,
what would you say?

541
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,265
I'm just sitting here
with Spike and Robbie,

542
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,789
that girl walks
by, what do I say?

543
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,660
Yes.

544
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,409
I dunno.

545
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,412
I'd probably say something like

546
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:01,244
God, I'd like to fuck
that girl's tits.

547
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,465
It doesn't mean anything.

548
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:07,033
When a guy says that, it's
just like a figure of speech.

549
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,862
It doesn't mean I want to
actually go find that girl

550
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,428
and fuck her tits.

551
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,779
It just means that it's like
I could be saying anything.

552
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,215
Hey guys, you want to
go have some spaghetti

553
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,433
or fuck girls tits?

554
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:18,000
I mean, it just
doesn't mean anything.

555
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,264
Oh, well call me crazy,

556
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:23,745
but when we're sitting
here cuddling romantically

557
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,399
in the very spot that we were

558
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,488
going to be married
in in four days,

559
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,838
and you're talking about
fucking some girl's tits

560
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,579
well, then it means something!

561
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,021
Fine.

562
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,893
Okay, fine.

563
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,330
This is what happens
when I try to be honest.

564
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:46,550
This is the kind
of safe environment

565
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:50,032
that you create for us
to communicate openly.

566
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:57,953
So you fantasize about
fucking other women?

567
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,176
Do I have a point, Roxanne?

568
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,569
That when I try to be
honest, I get in trouble

569
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:06,788
and when I try to nicely say

570
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,050
that I don't want to
talk about something,

571
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,791
I get accused of
withholding secrets

572
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,706
and not wanting to be close.

573
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,360
Tabitha, do you
think you can listen

574
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,318
to Wirey's response
to your questions

575
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,625
and not react with
anger right away?

576
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,975
Just listen, hear him,

577
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:23,631
and maybe try to understand
where he's coming from?

578
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:27,504
Yes, definitely.

579
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,078
What was the question again?

580
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,474
Do you fantasize about
fucking other women?

581
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:41,562
Absolutely.

582
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,304
Fine.

583
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,392
No, no, sure.

584
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,436
Just walk away now.

585
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,611
Now you can just
walk away, right?

586
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:48,830
Up there you want to talk.

587
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:49,788
Now you just run away.

588
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,441
Now you don't wanna talk.

589
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,574
How is this my fault?

590
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,054
Tell me, how is this my fault?

591
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,446
How does this whole
thing become my fault?

592
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,274
You need to stop talking now.

593
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:00,537
Oh.

594
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,888
Oh, I need to stop talking now.

595
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,367
Then you wanted me to talk.

596
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,847
Now you don't want me to talk.

597
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,327
There, I can't talk.

598
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,241
Here.

599
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,024
Shut up!

600
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:09,982
Shut your face, okay!

601
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:10,634
I'm second guessing everything.

602
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:11,461
So, shut up!

603
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,639
Honey, come on.

604
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:17,685
Come on.

605
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:22,081
Fine, go, go, go right.

606
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:23,822
Honey.

607
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:27,260
Honey, what if we try
living in the same house,

608
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,218
but in separate
rooms for awhile?

609
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:32,482
Maybe something like
that could help.

610
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:33,570
Honey?

611
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,183
Honey.

612
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,883
The next thing
I knew, I turned 13.

613
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,885
My father bought me a
sky blue Stratocaster

614
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,887
and God bought me
Wendy and Stacy.

615
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,889
Two beautiful twin
girls who moved in

616
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,065
on the sixth floor and
replaced Slingon, Oren,

617
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,459
and Billy as my
building playmates.

618
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:53,199
Heads, Wendy.

619
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,896
Tails, Stacy.

620
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,855
Every fifth flip was five
minutes behind the bed.

621
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:01,250
It was 1975 and I was going
to junior high school.

622
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,904
Everything was going
to be different, baby.

623
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,472
Seventh grade, I had arrived.

624
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,430
I was hanging out with
the coolest kid in school,

625
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:09,084
smoking pot and
writing graffiti.

626
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,869
Devil One was my tag.

627
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,914
If you were the most seen on
one particular train line,

628
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,656
like the One or the A, you
were king on that line.

629
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,876
Like Taki 149 was
King of the Ones.

630
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,095
Moses 147 was King of the A.

631
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,097
My friend Greg was
King of the Twos.

632
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,187
I was king of the
yellow school bus fans.

633
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,581
A tad less prestigious,
but hey, it was something.

634
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,453
Things were finally
looking up for me.

635
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:31,367
I was feeling great.

636
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,978
Amassing my fans.

637
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,545
Was about to fall in
love with Rebecca Levine,

638
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,983
the prettiest, most popular
girl in my class

639
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,942
and land a starting guard
spot with the basketball team.

640
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,988
The gym glittered that day.

641
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,467
Now, wait a minute.

642
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,642
Gabe, what are you doing?

643
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:46,905
You're on the skins.

644
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,515
I'm not taking my shirt off.

645
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,038
Gabe, you're a skin.

646
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,735
You're on the skin team.

647
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:52,998
You understand?

648
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,564
I mean, how are your
teammates going to know

649
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:57,698
you're on the team, if you
don't have a shirt off?

650
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,004
I'm not taking my shirt off.

651
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:03,573
Wirey.

652
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,879
Gabe was odd.

653
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,098
He would never
take his shirt off.

654
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,142
It was weird.

655
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,970
Everyone would laugh at him.

656
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:11,364
Maybe he just caught a
chill easily or something.

657
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,280
Hell, I felt a bit of a
draft that day myself.

658
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,238
Did Gabe know something
the rest of us didn't?

659
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,066
I looked over at Rebecca.

660
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,155
She and her friends seemed
to be laughing at Gabe again,

661
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,549
but harder and more
sinister this time.

662
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:25,421
We stopped playing and it was
like slow motion or something

663
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:28,903
and then I realized they
weren't laughing at Gabe.

664
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,646
They were laughing at me and
so were the rest of the guys.

665
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:33,734
Greg included.

666
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,432
Yeah, I'd be laughing too,

667
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:37,651
if I was being schooled,

668
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,653
like I'm schooling
you fucking old women.

669
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,264
You're playing well, Wirey.

670
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,659
Go fix yourself?

671
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:48,009
What do you mean?

672
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:49,880
Fix yourself.

673
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,186
It seemed that somehow

674
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,753
unbeknownst to no one
but myself,

675
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:55,147
one of my balls was
hanging out of my pants.

676
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,280
Vince Lombardi could
not have delivered

677
00:32:58,324 --> 00:32:59,934
a motivational speech
that could've gotten me

678
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,979
back into that school.

679
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:01,980
Let alone that gym.

680
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,633
I dropped out of seventh grade

681
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,722
and sought refuge back
with my old friend, Robbie.

682
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:10,379
Thank God I was out of
that elitist private school

683
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:14,253
and back in my stomping
grounds, the subway.

684
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:16,081
With all the people smushing

685
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:19,127
and the warm smell of piss
and expensive perfume wafting.

686
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:20,955
No one could really
understand Robbie,

687
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,653
but I guess because we were
friends for awhile, I could.

688
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:25,090
So man, you ever
hear of Taki 149?

689
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,656
Of course, he's
King of the Ones.

690
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:30,095
Of course, he's
king of the Ones.

691
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,574
Yeah well, he's a
crazy motherfucker.

692
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:34,403
He blew up a subway with
two sticks of dynamite.

693
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,491
He keeps it in his house.

694
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:36,449
I saw it.

695
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:37,841
God.

696
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:44,718
God.

697
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:53,422
No way.

698
00:33:58,123 --> 00:33:59,733
What?

699
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:03,258
But.

700
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:06,783
But, I don't even know him.

701
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,697
I've never even
seen him or met him.

702
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,657
Why would he be mad at me?

703
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:17,838
Robbie's here.

704
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,672
You got the money?

705
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,108
Where's Taki?

706
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,978
He wants me to get
it and give it to him.

707
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,724
What is this?

708
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:35,899
It's all I could get.

709
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,118
I don't get my
allowance until Friday.

710
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,380
How much is your allowance?

711
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,164
Five bucks.

712
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:40,426
That's lucky.

713
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,775
Taki wants five bucks on Friday,

714
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:44,473
transistor radio and
your baseball glove.

715
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,301
Not my baseball glove.

716
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,085
He said he would beat
the shit out of you,

717
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,870
and make you eat dog shit,

718
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:51,784
and wash it down with water
from the Hudson River.

719
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:52,742
Sorry, man.

720
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,831
I lived in total
fear for my life.

721
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,747
My mother noticed
something was wrong

722
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,532
and in one of her
cooler moments,

723
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,142
she came up with
the idea to summon

724
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,709
an old FBI friend of hers

725
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,928
to interrogate Robbie
in the kitchen.

726
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:09,281
You ever been in
prison son, huh?

727
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,804
Well, you better start watching

728
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,327
some of those old prison movies

729
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,894
so you can get used to it

730
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,722
because felony extortion
is going to land you

731
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,811
in a slammer in a heartbeat!

732
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:21,902
Now, where is that Taki 149,

733
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,078
and where is Wirey's stuff

734
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,385
and you better start giving
me some straight answers here

735
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,213
or you're going to be
playing wet nurse maid

736
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:31,085
to about 100 rapist murderers.

737
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:35,655
We may even arrest and
convict your mother

738
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,570
as an accomplice and
throw her in the slammer

739
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,267
to keep your sorry ass company!

740
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:42,966
We found that although
Taki 149 did exist,

741
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,272
Robbie didn't even know him,

742
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,100
and he certainly
didn't know me,

743
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,494
let alone want to kill me if
I didn't give him my things.

744
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,279
Robbie had been extorting
me all on his own.

745
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,673
I was totally humiliated

746
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,762
and couldn't bear to be
seen in my neighborhood.

747
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:58,808
So I decided to move to Vermont
and live with my father.

748
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,549
It had to be better there.

749
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,639
All right, all right.

750
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,597
Settle down.

751
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,946
Class, settle down!

752
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,817
All right, listen up.

753
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:10,472
Class, we have a new
student up from New York.

754
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,561
Flatlander dink!

755
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:17,087
His name is Weirdy Spindle.

756
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:18,263
Nice name, Weirdy.

757
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:20,482
That's Wirey Spindell.

758
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:21,875
Wait a minute.

759
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,878
Doesn't he remind you of
that other flatlander kid

760
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,923
we had up here a
few years ago, son?

761
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,708
What was his name?

762
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:30,536
You mean Al?

763
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,103
Oh yeah, Al.

764
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,628
Yeah, it does kind
of look like Al.

765
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:38,108
He's got that flatlander
chin and everything.

766
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,025
That's right, Al.

767
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:46,421
All right class, this is
Al, the new flatlander.

768
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,903
Okay class, today we're
going to be studying war.

769
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,557
All the wars of America.

770
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:54,734
That's a dink girl shirt.

771
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:57,780
My grandmother
made me this shirt.

772
00:36:58,738 --> 00:36:59,869
Well, it's a faggy girl shirt

773
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,610
that only dinks would wear.

774
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,874
If you insult my shirt,
you're insulting my grandmother.

775
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,485
So what are you
gonna do about it?

776
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:09,096
So I'm gonna have to beat
your face in after school.

777
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,664
I had done well.

778
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:12,969
It was before lunch
on my first day

779
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,623
in Southern Vermont
High School,

780
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,844
and I had managed to
acquire a new nickname, Al,

781
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,367
that apparently
belonged to the previous

782
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,021
murder New York kid,

783
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,979
and I had a fight in the
parking lot after school

784
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:25,025
with the son of the
football team coach

785
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,853
who had five brothers
who were all heads

786
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,116
of various evil
sects in the school.

787
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,773
A couple blocked punches
and a teacher breaking it up

788
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,165
was the extent of the fight.

789
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,863
Minor damage in and of itself,

790
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,604
but the long lasting impact

791
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,301
was to resonate
through those corridors

792
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,129
for the entire next year.

793
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,566
I had arrived like Hiroshima.

794
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,959
I was on the map.

795
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,787
Every kid would drill me hard

796
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,267
and threatened to
kill me in shop class

797
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,225
or at football practice
or after school.

798
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,488
I found that if I cried,
they wouldn't hit me as hard

799
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:54,402
or as many times.

800
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:57,753
If you hit him in
the arm, he'll cry!

801
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,975
It became a joke,

802
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,890
but at least I was
avoiding beatings.

803
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,196
Until one day a kid
came out of the shadows

804
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
and punched me in the face.

805
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:22,387
Everybody, Al shit his pants!

806
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,345
Norser punched down
the flatlander dink,

807
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,999
shit all in his pants!

808
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,957
If you hit him in the face,

809
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,133
he'll cry and shit
his pants too!

810
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,961
Hit him!

811
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,922
But then, in an
effort to regain

812
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,054
at least a ray of self-respect,

813
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:41,667
proving I was not phased by
the most violent gang tackles

814
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,016
I flipped the football

815
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,018
accidentally hitting
Mike Johnson,

816
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:49,065
undoubtedly the meanest kid in
school, directly in the nuts.

817
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:51,677
I'm going to beat your
face in so fucking hard

818
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,288
your whole family's gonna
be crying and shitting

819
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,508
and puking and pissing and
and whatever the hell else

820
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,466
your weird flatlander dinks do!

821
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,688
For some reason I picked
this moment to stand tall.

822
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,124
Oh yeah!

823
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,473
That's what your
mother said last night

824
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,823
after I fucked her in the ass!

825
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,870
Okay girls, hit the showers.

826
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,222
I didn't think it would
be too wise to shower

827
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:17,355
with the rest of my
teammates that evening.

828
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,836
Let's go Wirey, you're
going to be late for school.

829
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,621
I'm not going to
school, I'm sick.

830
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:27,016
You're fine.

831
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,018
Get dressed and come
down to breakfast.

832
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,803
I'm not going to school!

833
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,461
You will not speak to
me in that tone of voice.

834
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,201
This isn't your mother's house.

835
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,768
Here, you treat me with respect.

836
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,727
I'm your father and I
tell you what to do.

837
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,904
Now get dressed and
come down to breakfast

838
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,645
and eat with the family.

839
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,951
That's what families do.

840
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,388
There was still only one way

841
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,259
I was going to go
to school that day.

842
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,216
Wirey, let's go.

843
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,304
It's getting late.

844
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,003
And that was to steal
a hit of window pane

845
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:59,397
from my father's drug stash.

846
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,050
I knew he had it
because I saw his friend

847
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:02,530
Bill Dwyer give it to him.

848
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,445
My father had met Bill
when they were both

849
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,012
at Teacher's College.

850
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:08,144
I didn't really care for Bill.

851
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:11,147
Hey, hey.

852
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:12,540
Hi guys!

853
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:15,021
Wirey, so glad you
could come tonight.

854
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:15,848
That's a nice shirt.

855
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:16,675
They were nudists.

856
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:18,241
It disgusted me.

857
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:20,287
Please don't touch me.

858
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,638
All I remember is old
dicks and Birkenstocks.

859
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,771
My genius plan was to
take an Exacto knife

860
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,381
and clip off a
bit from each side

861
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,122
of the square window pane.

862
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,167
That way, if you added
up all four sides,

863
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:32,691
I'd be taking half a hit,

864
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,736
but leaving it the
same shape just smaller

865
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,172
so he wouldn't notice any gone.

866
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:38,261
The only problem was
they were so hard

867
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,438
that when you cut them,
they would fly off.

868
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:48,533
A fitting metaphor for how
I felt most of my life,

869
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:50,491
like looking for a
quarter hit of window pane

870
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,755
in a shag carpet, but then
again, I always found it.

871
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:56,932
Window pane in my
shredded wheat

872
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:59,239
on judgment day
in eighth grade.

873
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:02,155
I had no idea how I would
feel or what I'd feel,

874
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,852
but I had faith it
would feel different

875
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:06,028
than the way I felt before.

876
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:08,291
I don't know if it was the
acid starting to kick in

877
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:09,945
or just the
overwhelming feeling

878
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,904
that I had truly found
the answer to my problem,

879
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:15,864
whatever it was, Mike Johnson
was a million miles away.

880
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,400
Until suddenly.

881
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,272
Ready to die, dick fuck?

882
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:35,275
Principal wants
to see you both.

883
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:39,322
And then in one of the most
unexpected moments of my life.

884
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:41,455
I just want people to like me.

885
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,069
I was in New York once.

886
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:48,723
It was okay.

887
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:51,639
Want some window pane?

888
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,250
Cool, thanks.

889
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:59,517
I had a friend and soon
I had lots of friends.

890
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,257
The kids because of
my desire to ingest

891
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,172
as many drugs as
often as possible

892
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:06,175
and the townspeople because
I could play basketball.

893
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,743
Well,
it comes down to this Bob,

894
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:10,832
for the state championship.

895
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:13,226
The Hawks are down by one.

896
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:15,315
I believe there is
10 seconds left.

897
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,318
Okay guys, get
the ball to Wirey.

898
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,363
Break the press.

899
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,930
Wirey, make something happen!

900
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:22,757
Let's go!

901
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,517
The coach liked me,

902
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,041
one, because I was the
best player on the team,

903
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:48,391
and two, because I was
fucking his daughter.

904
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:52,526
See, I'd started this rock
band, Distorted Visions.

905
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,137
I didn't actually
stay the drummer.

906
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:03,493
My own band ended up
kicking me out of drummer

907
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:06,453
when they found a better guy
and made me guitar player.

908
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,418
Then they kicked
me out of guitar

909
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:17,725
when they found a better guitar
player and made me singer

910
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,162
and it turned out
to be my calling.

911
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:35,090
It was a plethora of rural
America's pop anthems.

912
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:39,704
Taking Care of Business,
Freebird, Stairway to Heaven,

913
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:42,620
and finally, the PS
Stair Resistance.

914
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,232
There was a no sweeter moment
in my life than the roar

915
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:49,191
after completing an
inspired cover of Dream On.

916
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,671
My impeccable showmanship

917
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,978
making up admirably
for my total inability

918
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:55,589
to come anywhere close to
hitting the high notes.

919
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:07,688
And then just when
it seemed euphoria

920
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:09,472
could burst no grander,

921
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:11,561
Stairway let me off
on poor Betty.

922
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:14,347
She was 19, five feet tall
with the largest breasts

923
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,305
I've to this day ever seen.

924
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:18,960
She had a VW bug with
a bitching eight track

925
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,179
and she was fine.

926
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:24,966
She was the one who first
properly took my virginity.

927
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,838
She took it properly that night

928
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,449
and took it frequently and
properly for some time to come.

929
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,234
Betty had like an annex house

930
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:34,584
off of coach's regular house.

931
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:36,456
I would stay there often.

932
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:37,587
Hey coach.

933
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,375
Hey, don't get too
shit-faced, Wirey.

934
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:45,421
We got state
sectionals tomorrow.

935
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:48,729
No problem, coach.

936
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:57,825
What?

937
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,437
She's still your
daughter, Jim.

938
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:02,569
Mabel, she's 19.

939
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:04,571
She's too old for
me to fuck anymore.

940
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:13,885
I'm just joking.

941
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:15,800
It was like my second family.

942
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:17,540
It was a much better situation

943
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,717
than the evolved
intellectual liberal life

944
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,501
that had blossomed at home.

945
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:25,200
Judy and I want you both
to know how much we love you

946
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:28,421
and in order to remain together,

947
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:33,426
we're going to have to
separate, Judy and I,

948
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:35,776
but stay living
in the same house

949
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,430
and on alternating weekends,

950
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:40,389
we're going to have
our respective friends

951
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:43,784
come stay here with us
while the other goes away

952
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:46,352
to be with their friend.

953
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:49,485
All for the good of our family.

954
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:53,228
For the good of the family

955
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:55,187
my father spent the
next 20 weekends,

956
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,623
every other one in our house

957
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,104
fucking his 19 year
old piano student.

958
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:01,410
Judy, meanwhile, for
the good of the family,

959
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:04,370
had her alternate
weekend live in friend,

960
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:07,460
a very mavericky
person named Roxanne.

961
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,420
Needless to say, I rebelled.

962
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:13,118
The defining moment
being my father

963
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:14,684
having come home from work

964
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:17,209
to find me having eaten
every bit of his acid,

965
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:19,777
smoked every bit of
his pot, coke, hash,

966
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,735
and some way ingested
all the drugs

967
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,432
in his secret tea tin

968
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:25,608
and having the vacuum
cleaner on my dick.

969
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:48,501
It's like I don't even fucking

970
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:50,851
know where we're at
right now, you know?

971
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,637
He just walked in.

972
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,338
Okay, yeah.

973
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:00,818
The wedding was
now three days away.

974
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,384
Therapy hadn't been
extremely effective

975
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:04,647
and both of us were
getting really tense.

976
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,345
I believe we loved each
other more than ever,

977
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:08,042
but I just don't
think we had any faith

978
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:09,435
that that would have
anything to do with impacting

979
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:11,567
our ability to
actually live together.

980
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:13,221
I had had this
problem for 30 years.

981
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,310
No matter how much I fucking
wanted it to go away,

982
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:17,008
it just wasn't gonna happen
in the next three days

983
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:18,879
and I was getting exhausted
by talking about it

984
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:21,447
and I just didn't think
we need to see any shrink.

985
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,492
Tabitha and I always
communicated very well.

986
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,849
I realized it was
going to be an issue.

987
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:05,883
First, we're going
to fly to London

988
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:08,494
and then I think
that we're going to

989
00:48:08,537 --> 00:48:09,887
rent a double decker bus,

990
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:14,239
and then maybe put cans
on both the levels.

991
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:17,503
I know, I know, but I think
it's kind of tacky, fun,

992
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:18,634
and tacky, cool.

993
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:19,897
Like nasty good.

994
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,037
Hold on a second.

995
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:32,257
Yeah, sweetie.

996
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:38,437
Did you for any
reason spray baby oil

997
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,526
all over the bottom of our tub?

998
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:42,658
No, I don't spray
it all over the tub.

999
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:44,399
I put a couple of
drops in my bath.

1000
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:48,012
Put a couple
drops in your bath.

1001
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:50,014
Yeah, you got a
problem with that?

1002
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,716
Got a problem with that?

1003
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:57,760
Yeah.

1004
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:58,544
No.

1005
00:48:58,587 --> 00:48:59,893
I don't have a problem.

1006
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:04,463
I don't have a problem
with anything you do ever

1007
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,726
because I love you.

1008
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:09,424
Okay, no, it's fine.

1009
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:10,643
It's just Wirey.

1010
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:26,267
I'll call you back.

1011
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,467
Hi, honey.

1012
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:56,080
Honey, do you think
that we communicate well?

1013
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,473
Extremely well.

1014
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:00,606
She disagreed and as
a last ditch effort,

1015
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,521
we went back to
the shrink again.

1016
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:03,870
Although we were
both big enough

1017
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:05,437
to laugh about it a little bit,
there really

1018
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,700
just wasn't anything
funny about it anymore.

1019
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:12,531
Our marriage, our
entire relationship

1020
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:13,706
was in serious jeopardy.

1021
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:16,665
I think we just
really felt like

1022
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,667
two very different
people at that point.

1023
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:20,626
You don't think about
me when you jerk off.

1024
00:50:20,669 --> 00:50:23,063
Never once have I thought
about you when I jerk off.

1025
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:26,066
Never once have you thought
about me when you jerk off.

1026
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,111
Actually, actually,
that's not true.

1027
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,068
That's not true.

1028
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:29,635
That's not entirely true.

1029
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,289
If we're having sex together

1030
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:33,508
and as part of our sex, I
jerk off, and she's there,

1031
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,815
then yes, I definitely
think about her,

1032
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:38,165
but if it's just purely
private shower jerking off,

1033
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:39,166
then never.

1034
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,863
It's always about someone else.

1035
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:46,086
Come on, honey.

1036
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,305
I mean, we're both big.

1037
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:49,785
I don't particularly
love the idea,

1038
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:53,311
but I accept that you
don't think about me

1039
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:54,225
when you jerk off.

1040
00:50:57,315 --> 00:50:58,925
Yes, I do.

1041
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,843
I mean, not all the time.

1042
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,714
Yeah, pretty much.

1043
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:13,983
Honey.

1044
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:17,857
See, you're my reality.

1045
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,034
So I don't need you
to be my fantasy

1046
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,689
because I love
that in real life,

1047
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:26,996
I love that I actually have you.

1048
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,564
So in my fantasy life,

1049
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,131
I go and fuck the other women

1050
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,524
because that way in real life,

1051
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,962
I don't actually have
to go fuck anyone else

1052
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:39,139
and I get to keep
this wonderful,

1053
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:42,795
fabulous, monogamous
relationship.

1054
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,974
Does that make sense to anyone?

1055
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:52,631
Honey?

1056
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,287
Roxanne?

1057
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:06,123
Hi honey, how's it going?

1058
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:06,949
Want some tea?

1059
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,823
Thanks, I'm fine, mom.

1060
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:15,567
Oh, what did I
want to ask you?

1061
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,959
Oh, yeah.

1062
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,874
Are you still getting
married on Saturday?

1063
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,576
I was hitting
my stride back in

1064
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,012
high school in New York.

1065
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:27,666
It was the summer
before my senior year

1066
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:29,842
and I figured I'd check
out the rainbow gathering.

1067
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:32,366
Some weird hippie Fest
that happened every year.

1068
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:39,330
Lovely Swedish Helena
from Brooklyn Heights

1069
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:40,940
happened upon me instantly.

1070
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:44,813
Welcome.

1071
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,164
We got really stoned
and fell in love that day.

1072
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,209
As it turned out,

1073
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,819
Helena needed to
properly teach me

1074
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,865
how to go down on a woman.

1075
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:55,694
A skill historically,
I was eager to perfect

1076
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:57,174
due to the rather
excitable nature

1077
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:59,132
of my own
ejaculation timetable.

1078
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:01,613
If I could first
satisfy my lover

1079
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,092
then it didn't really matter

1080
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:04,833
that on the second and
third thrust at best,

1081
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,966
sometimes even the mere
feeling of insertion,

1082
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,838
well once actually
in Great Neck.

1083
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,826
I don't think we
should go any further.

1084
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,088
Don't you like it?

1085
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:44,569
No, no, no, it feels great.

1086
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:49,965
I like you so much.

1087
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:55,971
I don't want to go
too fast and ruin it.

1088
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:57,190
You're so sweet.

1089
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,844
What was I going to say?

1090
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:00,324
The anticipation of your
gorgeous mouth on my dick

1091
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,151
just made me cum in my pants.

1092
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:03,849
I have to take the next train
back to Manhattan immediately.

1093
00:54:03,892 --> 00:54:06,155
See you at the next
Almond Brothers concert.

1094
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:09,768
Anyway, Helena
taught me properly.

1095
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:17,123
Okay, look!

1096
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:21,301
Wirey, your enthusiasm is great,

1097
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:24,086
but you're all over the place.

1098
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,828
Like a friendly puppy dog.

1099
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:29,483
Okay, so do it like this.

1100
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,313
No.

1101
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,883
Under her tutilage,
I became skilled

1102
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:40,233
and then after a series
of tough decisions.

1103
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:48,154
You gonna come over, Wirey?

1104
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,854
What are you guys doing?

1105
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:54,943
We're going to go
hang out at my house.

1106
00:54:58,382 --> 00:54:59,165
Can you hold
that for a second?

1107
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,688
Yeah.

1108
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:02,255
Thanks.

1109
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,083
Concert was
really good, right?

1110
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:05,127
I love Neil Young.

1111
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:10,698
Thanks.

1112
00:55:11,656 --> 00:55:13,658
I'm gonna go with these guys.

1113
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:14,963
I know it seems harsh,

1114
00:55:15,007 --> 00:55:16,313
but it always paid handsomely

1115
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,532
with the twins on
the sixth floor.

1116
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,948
So do you guys want
anything to drink?

1117
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:44,123
Wirey?

1118
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,167
Yeah.

1119
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,125
What do you want?

1120
00:55:46,168 --> 00:55:47,387
Jack and Coke is fine.

1121
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:52,697
So, you want a back rub?

1122
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,351
Ah, the back rub.

1123
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,178
Adolescent foreplay.

1124
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:58,093
Beth's invitation for sex.

1125
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,752
Come on, let's go
to my parents' room.

1126
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:10,279
Can you hold that?

1127
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:13,195
Beth won the coin toss,

1128
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,850
but Sarah vetoed the decision
and enforced house rules.

1129
00:56:15,894 --> 00:56:18,244
She was not about to let her
best friend fuck the new guy

1130
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:21,203
in her house in the next
room while she slept alone.

1131
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:23,989
It's not like I was
disappointed or anything.

1132
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,991
I mean, Sarah was gorgeous

1133
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:28,080
and I could not wait to
try out my newly acquired

1134
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:30,517
cunnilingual prowess on
her 17 year old body.

1135
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:35,000
I mean, I didn't think of it
as a 17 year old body then.

1136
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:37,045
She was just a cute girl.

1137
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:39,004
Man, if God only allowed
you to understand

1138
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:41,441
that a 17 year old girl
was a 17 year old girl

1139
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:42,921
when you were 17, right?

1140
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:46,968
I was resigned never to have
another Great Neck experience.

1141
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:49,188
So I figured I'd just quickly
jerk off in the bathroom

1142
00:56:49,231 --> 00:56:51,190
to get that first excitement
cum out of the way,

1143
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,018
knowing that I had
infinitely more staying power

1144
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:54,759
in the second go round.

1145
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:56,543
I mean, I would have
a damn good chance

1146
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:57,979
to make it to actual intercourse

1147
00:56:58,023 --> 00:56:59,807
and possibly even
go a minute or so,

1148
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:03,202
but unbelievably, I was having
a hard time getting it up,

1149
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:05,944
which believe me had
never been a problem,

1150
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:08,250
but there was just
too much going on.

1151
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:10,470
Was she ready out
there just waiting,

1152
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:11,950
wondering what I was doing?

1153
00:57:11,993 --> 00:57:13,386
Did she know what I was doing?

1154
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,127
Could I get horny
enough quick enough

1155
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,217
after I came in the bathroom
to not have it be weird to her?

1156
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,525
Strange pressures I
had never felt before.

1157
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:23,135
I took the bit in my teeth,

1158
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:25,224
so to speak and
soldiered through it

1159
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,052
and just when I
was about to cum.

1160
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:28,314
I'm going to go to bed

1161
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:30,098
if you don't come
out here pretty soon.

1162
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,144
Oh my God.

1163
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:34,712
My plan had backfired
in the grossest of ways.

1164
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:36,278
I was so close to
cumming that I was afraid

1165
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:38,237
the wind against my
dick as I ran to her bed

1166
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,717
would make me lose it,

1167
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,805
but I had to risk it.

1168
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,069
I was on her like white
on fucking rice man.

1169
00:57:44,112 --> 00:57:45,984
I went straight for the money,
not wanting to even risk

1170
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:48,247
rubbing against
her during a kiss.

1171
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,120
The only problem was there
was no position I could get in

1172
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,122
while going down on
her where my dick

1173
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,515
wasn't rubbing on something.

1174
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,648
Her leg, my own leg.

1175
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,388
I had no choice,

1176
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,347
but to just go for it as
best and as fast as I could

1177
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,784
and then magic.

1178
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:06,395
My first simultaneous orgasm.

1179
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:07,962
Her at the hands
of my loving mouth

1180
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:10,269
and me at the hands of
her 300 count bedsheets

1181
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:11,488
I rubbed against.

1182
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,100
Everything was going great

1183
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:17,015
until we went to
Boston to see some band

1184
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:19,583
her friend had told her
had a cute bass player.

1185
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:23,151
Boston, what a piece
of shit town, huh?

1186
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:26,067
Pseudo intellectual, Harvard
going, racist loving,

1187
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,505
Celtic cheering, blue
blood impersonating

1188
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:30,811
fucking white trash
Capital of the world.

1189
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:32,552
Actually like the city itself,

1190
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,989
if you could just kill
all the Bostonian's,

1191
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:37,209
import New Yorkers and make it
another borough of Manhattan,

1192
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:38,993
it could actually work.

1193
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,212
Vermont was close to New York.

1194
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,561
So I chose hitchhiking there

1195
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,563
to stay with my
father for the night,

1196
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,783
over staying at the cute
bass players couch,

1197
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:48,133
listening to him fuck
my girlfriend all night.

1198
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:51,745
Anyway, Sarah, my first
true love was gone

1199
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:56,750
and soon after, so was probably
my biggest love of life.

1200
00:58:56,794 --> 00:59:00,145
A love I worked for incessantly
in spite of all my madness,

1201
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:02,147
my basketball career.

1202
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,106
At the biggest game
of my life,

1203
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,673
when my coach had called in

1204
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:08,675
a couple of division one
schools to look at me,

1205
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:10,242
I was too fucked up to play.

1206
00:59:12,244 --> 00:59:13,941
Alcohol and drugs were
beginning to bare their

1207
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:16,378
teeth now and like a good
alcoholic and drug addict

1208
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:17,902
I ignored and denied.

1209
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:21,340
Very quickly I forgot
about my lifelong dream.

1210
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:25,518
Went on a trip to visit
colleges in the Northeast

1211
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,259
and there it happened.

1212
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:30,044
I was placed in the
presence of an angel.

1213
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:32,090
God had moved the
universe in such a way

1214
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,309
as to brush me and
this heavenly creature

1215
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:37,399
against one another in what
would be an epic encounter.

1216
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:43,318
Samantha Berlin,
the love of my life.

1217
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,892
♪ I don't wanna
know you right now ♪

1218
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:01,467
♪ Just like me

1219
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:10,955
I bought a Cutlass
for 500 bucks

1220
01:00:10,998 --> 01:00:13,348
and drove to Bard with
a half gallon of gin

1221
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:17,614
and half ounce of 83%
pure jazz musician Coke.

1222
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:20,399
Luckily they had this
immediate admission plan thing

1223
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:22,706
and I was told they didn't
care that much about SATs,

1224
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:23,707
which was a good thing

1225
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,709
since I got to combined 440,

1226
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:28,363
one of the 10 worst scores
in New York state history.

1227
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:29,669
So low it was studied.

1228
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:31,802
College anyone?

1229
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,979
We hear you got good Coke.

1230
01:00:36,284 --> 01:00:37,285
I'm Niles.

1231
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:38,373
This is Jibs,

1232
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,724
and Stephanie Rent-A-Fuck.

1233
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:43,814
She's a witch with a fake
breast over her heart

1234
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:45,772
and she's my girlfriend.

1235
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:47,513
Don't you fucking touch her!

1236
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:51,256
What you got there?

1237
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:01,570
Will you give us a break,

1238
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:03,355
if we take 10
grams of that shit?

1239
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:10,841
I give you a break.

1240
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,364
My roommate bangs
your girlfriend,

1241
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,105
Stephanie Rent-A-Fuck
in the ass,

1242
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:16,281
on the floor right
now while we watch.

1243
01:01:16,324 --> 01:01:18,413
Do you have a
pillow for my knees?

1244
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:19,371
Get the fuck up!

1245
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,158
You're an asshole.

1246
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:27,292
Meet us after the auditions
at Proctor.

1247
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:30,164
Bunch of fucking weirdos!

1248
01:01:37,084 --> 01:01:38,477
Wirey, Spindell.

1249
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:41,045
I'm Dave.

1250
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:43,438
First of all, I'd like to
thank you all for coming.

1251
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:45,440
Since my basketball
career was over,

1252
01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:47,747
I became an acting
and dance major.

1253
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,531
That's what Samantha was

1254
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:52,926
and I figured it was the
best way to get close to her.

1255
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,973
It was the hottest
production of the semester

1256
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,539
by the coolest director.

1257
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,542
Coke and excitement
course through my veins,

1258
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,066
all the training,
all the waiting,

1259
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,502
all the boredom and
all the bullshit

1260
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,504
was all for this moment.

1261
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:07,158
I was ready.

1262
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:08,507
Why wouldn't she look at me?

1263
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,161
I knew she saw me come in.

1264
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:11,684
I knew she knew
where I was sitting.

1265
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,425
Please, she didn't
know I fucking existed.

1266
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,993
All I know is I
need to get fucked

1267
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:18,038
in the worst way tonight.

1268
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,400
Right, nice.

1269
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:40,495
I'm sorry.

1270
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:43,760
I was really looking forward
to doing it with you.

1271
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,022
Who the fuck are you?

1272
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:50,810
I'm the boy who's
going to break your heart

1273
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,246
into little pieces.

1274
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:54,379
Go fuck yourself.

1275
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:11,962
Hey, you guys
wanna do some coke?

1276
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:13,920
Sure.

1277
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,099
She was thoroughly
unimpressed.

1278
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:21,145
She wasn't impressed
that I had great coke.

1279
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:23,451
She wasn't impressed
that I turned her on.

1280
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:27,107
So what , the process
had begun?

1281
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:28,892
I'd begun to infiltrate her.

1282
01:03:28,935 --> 01:03:30,676
She was coming around,

1283
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,594
but she liked pretending
like she wasn't.

1284
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:38,771
I was supposed to come out
of the well with the knife.

1285
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,469
Take a quick look at Lear's
wife and then kill Lear

1286
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,820
but the Jack was rushing.

1287
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,778
Coke was rushing and
the crowd was rushing

1288
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,693
and Samantha had
really pissed me off.

1289
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:50,739
She was going to
notice me tonight.

1290
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,011
Hey, Samantha.

1291
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,627
You ever ever
pull that shit again

1292
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,977
and I swear I'll
fucking kill you.

1293
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:12,718
You noticed me, huh?

1294
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:15,895
You fucking teasing bitch,
you notice me now, huh?

1295
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:16,765
Huh?

1296
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:22,859
I don't know whether
to cut your throat

1297
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:25,557
or kiss you.

1298
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:29,126
Either way, I think you'll
notice me then.

1299
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:25,486
You wanna kill me, Wirey?

1300
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:27,836
Is that what you want?

1301
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:31,753
Come on.

1302
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:33,930
Kill me, baby.

1303
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:39,587
Kill me.

1304
01:05:45,898 --> 01:05:46,899
Kill me, baby.

1305
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:17,859
It was truly the most
incredible moment of my life.

1306
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:19,992
Seeing her standing in
my doorway that night.

1307
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:26,085
We made love in the hall, on
the floor of that freshman dorm

1308
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:29,523
till the sun came up and
people started going to class.

1309
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:32,570
They just stepped over us
like we weren't there.

1310
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:35,007
Like it was a dream.

1311
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:35,834
Magic.

1312
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:38,054
Like heaven.

1313
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,111
This changes nothing.

1314
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,635
You know that, right?

1315
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,037
This meant nothing.

1316
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,086
I didn't even cum.

1317
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,569
It was a fuck, that's all.

1318
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:33,805
You're the boy that's going
to do what to my heart?

1319
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:51,910
Fucking bitch!

1320
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:53,737
Fuck her!

1321
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,044
Fuck!

1322
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:57,871
Fuckin!

1323
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:01,224
You don't shoot, Wirey.

1324
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:02,964
I do now.

1325
01:10:00,674 --> 01:10:02,459
She's turning blue, Wirey.

1326
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,249
You're fucking a
dead girl, you dick.

1327
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:16,124
I can't believe he's
fucking a dead girl.

1328
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:17,387
I'm next.

1329
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,084
I'm next.

1330
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:21,391
I guess by my rubbing
her left fake breast hard

1331
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:23,262
breathing into her
mouth while kissing her

1332
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:26,047
and slamming her torso
while I fucked her,

1333
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:29,529
I succeeded in some sort of
perverse CPR and revived her.

1334
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:30,878
I guess it wasn't her time.

1335
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:33,925
My time was not long though.

1336
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:36,101
As you can imagine,
my bottom was nearing.

1337
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:39,974
Yes, my friends,
amazingly enough,

1338
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:42,499
it got even worse than dying
from alcohol and heroin abuse

1339
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,891
and fucking dead girls.

1340
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:48,244
Samantha could be as cruel
and heartless as she wanted,

1341
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,897
but I had always
been able to easily

1342
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:51,377
see through her icy front

1343
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:54,162
to the soft, quiet,
soulful girl beneath.

1344
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:58,166
She was just frightened to
death like the rest of us.

1345
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,559
Her dance pieces were the most

1346
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:01,518
important thing in
the world to her.

1347
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,693
It was her senior dance project

1348
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:05,870
and she had asked
me to be in it.

1349
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:08,175
8:45 ballet had
actually paid off.

1350
01:11:09,264 --> 01:11:10,831
Samantha had let me in.

1351
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:14,835
It was the only way she
would let herself love me

1352
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:17,621
and it was the only way she
would let any of my love in.

1353
01:11:18,535 --> 01:11:21,668
Now in that biggest moment,
when I could shine for her,

1354
01:11:21,712 --> 01:11:24,932
when I could hold her up to
heaven for everyone to see,

1355
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:27,413
I was too drunk to hold
a simple Arabesque.

1356
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,070
I got incompletes
in every course

1357
01:11:32,112 --> 01:11:33,853
saying I had some
personal problems

1358
01:11:33,898 --> 01:11:35,943
I needed to take care of.

1359
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:37,945
I stayed in my house
drinking Jack Daniels,

1360
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,556
listening to Tom
Waits with Cliff

1361
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:40,905
and we tried to
convince ourselves

1362
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:42,950
we were ultra hip and adult

1363
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:45,126
not to go home to our
families for Thanksgiving

1364
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,344
like all the other kids.

1365
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:50,654
There was no
sudden white light,

1366
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:53,918
no angels taking my hand,
no drama of any kind.

1367
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,182
I just got up, got in my
car and drove to rehab.

1368
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,099
I knew this place that
my stepmother had gone to

1369
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:03,710
in New Hampshire just across
the river from Brattleboro.

1370
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:07,932
I finished my drink and
walked into the place.

1371
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:10,804
As long and as hard as
I had drugged and drank,

1372
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:13,764
the hours, the days, the years,

1373
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:15,809
the vengeance with which
I committed a slow,

1374
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:19,465
disgusting, ungodly suicide,
in a moment was all cleansed.

1375
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:22,642
No white light, no
angels, no drama.

1376
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:26,342
Doesn't get any more dramatic
than when heaven opens up

1377
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:29,127
and a million angels deliver
the whitest brightest light

1378
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,955
anyone's ever heard of.

1379
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:36,221
Eye contact from God baby,
from across the universe.

1380
01:13:18,175 --> 01:13:21,179
I'm an alcoholic and a
drug addict, Samantha.

1381
01:13:26,358 --> 01:13:28,925
That in no way
condones or excuses me

1382
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:30,493
for how I treated you.

1383
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,978
All I can do is hope
you'll believe me

1384
01:13:38,022 --> 01:13:44,289
when I tell you how
unbelievably sorry I am

1385
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:45,464
for having hurt you.

1386
01:13:47,858 --> 01:13:50,077
And fucked up your piece.

1387
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:58,129
Everything.

1388
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:04,788
I'm so sorry.

1389
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:12,317
Can you stop drinking?

1390
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:24,242
I haven't had a
drink in 31 days.

1391
01:14:38,082 --> 01:14:41,128
Bard was empty, icy
cold, and black.

1392
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,304
The dance studio was
warm and comforting.

1393
01:14:44,436 --> 01:14:45,655
I'd been there for
an hour or so

1394
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:47,264
working out this piece alone.

1395
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:51,661
I believe Samantha wished she
could be able to be with me,

1396
01:14:51,704 --> 01:14:54,228
but was still too
scared and explosive.

1397
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:56,317
I knew that apologies
and promises alone

1398
01:14:56,361 --> 01:14:58,362
wouldn't bring her
nearer to me,

1399
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:01,235
but I knew if I made a
piece for her she'd show

1400
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,804
and in the vulnerability
of enough moments together,

1401
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:09,766
I knew she would be mine
and I knew that she knew.

1402
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,698
Hello, Wirey.

1403
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:33,746
Where do we start?

1404
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:41,928
Take my hand.

1405
01:15:58,945 --> 01:15:59,684
Show me.

1406
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:14,091
I'm pleasantly surprised.

1407
01:16:31,282 --> 01:16:34,023
And then my worst nightmare,

1408
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:35,329
the thing that had happened

1409
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:37,244
to every girlfriend
I'd ever had,

1410
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,769
and I was sure would never
happen with Samantha.

1411
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,467
I'd love to bend that
girl over this bench

1412
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,121
and fuck her brains out.

1413
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:47,254
So?

1414
01:16:48,603 --> 01:16:50,300
So, Samantha's
coming up tonight.

1415
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,349
I was bored and repulsed
by everything about her

1416
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:58,178
and desperately wanted to
fuck every other girl I saw.

1417
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,226
A slow, steady undertow
of my backward movement

1418
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:03,619
made her ever more scared

1419
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:05,969
and caused her to
move closer to me,

1420
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:08,710
which in turn made me
run away all the more.

1421
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:11,539
I wanted so badly to
understand and to change,

1422
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:14,368
but I just didn't
have a clue how

1423
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,109
and so like so many other

1424
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:19,460
things I love dearly in
my life, Samantha was gone.

1425
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,726
I graduated and moved
back to New York.

1426
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:26,250
I couldn't deal with any
starving actor bullshit

1427
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:28,382
and Raphael the
doorman died of AIDs

1428
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:29,949
so I guess a sort of an homage,

1429
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:33,692
I took his job, but my
building had changed.

1430
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:35,389
My neighborhood had changed.

1431
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,566
Did I tell you my sister
is dating an Italian.

1432
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:39,611
She's apoplectic.

1433
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,134
I mean, I've met this guy.

1434
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,486
His hairline, just, it goes
right down into his shirt.

1435
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,706
Having to deal with all
you dicks who condescend.

1436
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,230
You fuckheads who are
more interested in proving

1437
01:17:50,273 --> 01:17:52,276
protecting your
inalienable rights

1438
01:17:52,318 --> 01:17:55,235
instead of serving the life
that gave you those rights.

1439
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:57,063
You reek of nothingness.

1440
01:17:57,107 --> 01:17:59,718
Park Avenue address laughs at
the importance you give it.

1441
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:01,981
The building has
infinitely more humanity

1442
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:03,722
than you do, and the
pavement under the awning

1443
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:05,289
more integrity.

1444
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:07,030
Even with your abandoned
poodles shit on it.

1445
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:08,814
Don't you see that
your lives are fascist

1446
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:11,469
and destructive to the proper
evolution of God's realm?

1447
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:13,601
Your pointless opinions
about the life you view

1448
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:15,603
as momentary
distress, self import,

1449
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:17,910
and egomania that makes
that cat piss cologne

1450
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,520
you wear smell like roses

1451
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:21,609
compared to the way I
know you feel about life.

1452
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:24,177
Think about your life for
one minute, one minute,

1453
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:26,049
and maybe you won't fuck
your partner's girlfriend

1454
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:27,790
and tell your wife you
were playing squash.

1455
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,313
You won't tip me 10 bucks
at Christmas after getting

1456
01:18:29,356 --> 01:18:30,967
your bonus for three million

1457
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:33,012
but basically it comes
down to one thing,

1458
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:35,406
if your doorman saw you getting
the shit kicked out of you

1459
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:38,148
in an alleyway by three
punks, for whatever reason,

1460
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:39,932
you were in his
neighborhood, on his block,

1461
01:18:39,976 --> 01:18:41,673
in the Bronx and you
were just getting

1462
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,806
your face stomped in
by people he knew,

1463
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,242
would he stop it?

1464
01:18:45,285 --> 01:18:46,591
All he has to do is
say, yo, cool out.

1465
01:18:46,634 --> 01:18:47,374
I know that guy.

1466
01:18:47,418 --> 01:18:48,201
He's all right.

1467
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:49,594
Would he do it?

1468
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:50,594
Or would he just
pretend he didn't see

1469
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:51,987
and continue on his way to buy

1470
01:18:52,031 --> 01:18:53,467
a lotto ticket at
the corner store?

1471
01:18:54,686 --> 01:18:56,383
Excuse me, did
you say something?

1472
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:57,602
No sir, nothing.

1473
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:00,431
Anyway.

1474
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:02,563
I guess I was angry.

1475
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:06,306
As a result, I spent large
amounts of time alone.

1476
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,179
Alone with large amounts
of chocolate ice cream,

1477
01:19:09,222 --> 01:19:11,050
and a date?

1478
01:19:11,094 --> 01:19:12,704
I couldn't get close enough
to even get rejected by a girl

1479
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,401
till I was 25.

1480
01:19:14,445 --> 01:19:16,273
That's four years
from Samantha.

1481
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:19,537
I was walking down
Madison Avenue one day,

1482
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,973
I had a broken right arm.

1483
01:19:21,017 --> 01:19:23,323
I had broken it in
Greece a month before.

1484
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:25,151
A place that taught
me that maybe I judged

1485
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:28,502
my father's nudist friends,
Bill and Mary a tad harshly

1486
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:29,982
for the merits of
this lifestyle,

1487
01:19:30,026 --> 01:19:31,941
did make themselves
apparent on that trip.

1488
01:19:32,637 --> 01:19:34,508
It also served as a
wonderful challenge

1489
01:19:34,552 --> 01:19:37,642
to my celibate, be alone,
find yourself, thing.

1490
01:19:38,599 --> 01:19:40,950
I did draw the line
at recreation though.

1491
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:43,909
I just couldn't be
flopping around all naked.

1492
01:19:43,952 --> 01:19:45,519
It was gross

1493
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:48,130
and that tampon string
thing had to go as well.

1494
01:19:48,174 --> 01:19:50,960
I mean, there has to be some
place to tuck that thing.

1495
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:52,831
Just somehow fucked up
the whole aesthetics

1496
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:54,441
of a beautiful young naked girl

1497
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:56,922
to have some teabag rope
hanging out all over.

1498
01:19:57,662 --> 01:20:00,143
I don't know, call me
a repressed American.

1499
01:20:00,186 --> 01:20:02,666
Anyway, being randy
as shit from the beach

1500
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,451
and wanting to continue
my inner search,

1501
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:07,585
I journeyed to a mountain
cliff to find my male roots.

1502
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:08,716
Pun always intended.

1503
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:13,460
As I stood there naked,
overlooking the Aegean Sea,

1504
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,419
I felt like man on earth.

1505
01:20:15,462 --> 01:20:18,161
How the first man who trod
the planet must've felt.

1506
01:20:22,905 --> 01:20:25,168
I wondered how caveman
must've jerked off.

1507
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:28,911
I decided they
probably just smashed

1508
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:30,608
their dicks against
jagged rocks.

1509
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,746
I was having some of
the best sex with myself

1510
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,575
I'd ever have when
unfortunately, I slipped.

1511
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:47,494
I had never been with a model
or a black woman before.

1512
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:49,757
Apparently the five-year
wait was worth it.

1513
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,543
God was rewarding
me handsomely.

1514
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:53,892
She was sexy as shit.

1515
01:20:55,675 --> 01:20:57,548
Now for the average man
having a cast on his right arm

1516
01:20:57,591 --> 01:20:58,897
might've proved a hindrance

1517
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:00,725
in his suave attempts
at second base

1518
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:02,639
but thanks to my early training

1519
01:21:02,683 --> 01:21:04,598
with my first grade
Chinese girlfriend

1520
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:07,123
it proved not the
least bit problematic.

1521
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,168
She seemed to have a
padded bra on though,

1522
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:11,300
which although a little odd,

1523
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:14,260
I figured it was due to her
insecurity about her bust size

1524
01:21:14,304 --> 01:21:16,915
or just some fashion thing
I knew nothing about,

1525
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:18,786
but then all of a sudden,

1526
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:20,701
and I don't quite know why

1527
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:23,661
my mind froze with
a peculiar idea.

1528
01:21:24,443 --> 01:21:25,663
Are you disappointed?

1529
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,063
Well, why would
I be disappointed?

1530
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:36,934
Because I'm not
what I appear to be.

1531
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,025
Well, what are you?

1532
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,942
Physically, I'm a gay man,

1533
01:21:43,986 --> 01:21:46,553
but I work as a
female runway model.

1534
01:21:47,598 --> 01:21:48,904
Physically, you're a gay man,

1535
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:51,732
but you work as a
female runway model.

1536
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:53,212
Yes.

1537
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:54,518
Huh?

1538
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:58,782
Well Danielle, Danny?

1539
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:00,523
Yeah, Danny.

1540
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:01,699
Well, Danny,

1541
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:04,049
I feel it's only
fair to tell you

1542
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:07,183
that I'm not attracted
physically to men.

1543
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:08,619
I mean, granted,

1544
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,925
I was just enjoying making
out with you quite a bit,

1545
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:13,537
but that's because
I thought you were

1546
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:20,022
the female runway model
part of your thing.

1547
01:22:21,806 --> 01:22:23,460
Have you ever been with a man?

1548
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:25,679
No,

1549
01:22:29,422 --> 01:22:31,076
and believe you me if
it were going to happen

1550
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,079
it would be right now with
me fucking your brains out

1551
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:35,428
in the back of this limo,

1552
01:22:36,603 --> 01:22:40,041
but Danny, it's not
going to happen.

1553
01:22:42,348 --> 01:22:43,610
Really?

1554
01:22:44,175 --> 01:22:44,960
Really.

1555
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,701
You sure?

1556
01:22:50,226 --> 01:22:51,009
I'm sure.

1557
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:57,668
How about if I
just gave you head?

1558
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,714
Is that the only
color lipstick you have?

1559
01:23:00,758 --> 01:23:05,502
No, I think I have
some midnight fire.

1560
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:06,764
No, Danny, I'm sorry.

1561
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:09,767
No, no, I just, I can't do it.

1562
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:57,902
I get off work.

1563
01:23:57,945 --> 01:23:59,686
It's three in the morning
on a Tuesday night.

1564
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,732
A tire spins on the
cobblestones below.

1565
01:24:02,646 --> 01:24:03,951
The windows rattling softly

1566
01:24:03,995 --> 01:24:06,302
like a basketball
in an empty gym.

1567
01:24:06,344 --> 01:24:07,693
20 below with windchill.

1568
01:24:07,737 --> 01:24:09,044
The streets are empty.

1569
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,089
All the windows in
my car are open.

1570
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:14,223
Have the heat blasting and the
torn leather jacket I love.

1571
01:24:14,266 --> 01:24:17,791
Just me with my tires
slapping the cold dark road.

1572
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:20,794
This is my giant hallway
and these are my cons

1573
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:22,840
racing down the silent marble.

1574
01:24:22,883 --> 01:24:25,451
Abandoned Christmas
trees rip across Tribeca

1575
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:27,410
like urban tumbleweeds.

1576
01:24:27,452 --> 01:24:30,717
The bad shocks ride me up
and down like a soft cradle,

1577
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:32,632
like being rocked
to sleep by a giant.

1578
01:24:33,546 --> 01:24:34,982
I haven't had a drink of booze

1579
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:36,809
or a shot of heroin
in five years today.

1580
01:24:37,898 --> 01:24:39,378
This is my New Year's card.

1581
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,382
Thank you God
for my life again.

1582
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:54,089
Samantha?

1583
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:59,224
Hold on a second, okay.

1584
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,055
Hello, Wirey.

1585
01:25:06,753 --> 01:25:08,277
So good to see you.

1586
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,237
I've been thinking a
lot about you lately.

1587
01:25:16,415 --> 01:25:17,938
I was going to find you.

1588
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,770
I've prayed for you every day.

1589
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:26,425
You know that.

1590
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:27,252
Thanks.

1591
01:25:28,949 --> 01:25:31,561
Can you, do you
want to get in?

1592
01:25:31,603 --> 01:25:34,389
It's it's nice
to see you, Wirey,

1593
01:25:34,433 --> 01:25:38,175
but that doesn't mean I
want you back in my life.

1594
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:51,494
Take care of yourself.

1595
01:25:54,627 --> 01:25:55,933
You too.

1596
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:03,853
Let's go.

1597
01:26:04,942 --> 01:26:05,986
Who's that?

1598
01:26:07,074 --> 01:26:08,163
Just someone I know.

1599
01:26:14,038 --> 01:26:16,910
I had never felt things
when they actually happened.

1600
01:26:17,868 --> 01:26:19,522
I never mourned people
when they hurt me.

1601
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:22,438
I would just jump to
something else to distract me.

1602
01:26:22,481 --> 01:26:24,570
I had never mourned Samantha.

1603
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:26,485
It was a sweet pain.

1604
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:29,053
A healing kind of pain

1605
01:26:29,096 --> 01:26:30,054
you know was going
to clear the deck

1606
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,490
so you can get a fresh start.

1607
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:39,411
Are you free?

1608
01:26:42,849 --> 01:26:44,808
What do you mean?

1609
01:26:44,851 --> 01:26:47,071
Well, you're gypsy
cab, aren't you?

1610
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:50,291
Is my car that fucked up?

1611
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:53,469
Sorry.

1612
01:26:57,299 --> 01:27:00,693
Hey, are you all right?

1613
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,225
Where you going?

1614
01:27:16,621 --> 01:27:17,928
You didn't have
a problem with it

1615
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:19,886
when you thought I was a
gypsy cab driver, right?

1616
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:24,804
Where you heading?

1617
01:27:26,937 --> 01:27:28,025
I'm going uptown.

1618
01:27:28,068 --> 01:27:29,068
Uptown.

1619
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:29,896
Where uptown?

1620
01:27:31,115 --> 01:27:32,943
56th and sixth.

1621
01:27:32,986 --> 01:27:34,031
Perfect.

1622
01:27:34,987 --> 01:27:36,468
Why don't you get in?

1623
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:37,382
You going that way?

1624
01:27:37,425 --> 01:27:39,079
Yes, I'm going that way.

1625
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,922
And that brings
us to today.

1626
01:28:02,973 --> 01:28:04,800
What do you guys wanna do?

1627
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:05,976
Get some coffee?

1628
01:28:06,019 --> 01:28:07,193
Yeah, sure.

1629
01:28:07,237 --> 01:28:07,978
Who gets decaf?

1630
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:08,892
I do.

1631
01:28:08,934 --> 01:28:10,894
Regular for me, hon.

1632
01:28:10,937 --> 01:28:12,112
I was still living
at my mother's house

1633
01:28:12,156 --> 01:28:13,112
having been banished there

1634
01:28:13,157 --> 01:28:15,072
after our last therapy session

1635
01:28:15,115 --> 01:28:16,594
and it was down
to the 11th hour.

1636
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,423
I needed to supply Tabitha with

1637
01:28:18,467 --> 01:28:20,686
an iron clad solution to my
problem by midnight tonight

1638
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:21,905
or the wedding was off.

1639
01:28:22,775 --> 01:28:23,994
I'm such a fucking idiot!

1640
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:25,343
How did I fuck this up?

1641
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:26,996
I'm so fucking pathetic.

1642
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:27,911
I can fix this.

1643
01:28:27,954 --> 01:28:29,434
What are you talking about?

1644
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:31,130
You need to fuck someone
other than your future wife.

1645
01:28:31,175 --> 01:28:32,045
Amen!

1646
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:33,482
What do you mean?

1647
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:35,135
A prostitute, a call girl.

1648
01:28:35,179 --> 01:28:36,615
Those aren't call girls.

1649
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:38,008
You can't just advertise
in the newspaper.

1650
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:40,532
What do you think full
body on body massage means

1651
01:28:40,576 --> 01:28:41,532
you fucking retard?

1652
01:28:41,577 --> 01:28:42,360
Here's a good one.

1653
01:28:42,404 --> 01:28:44,841
Ex playmate, 36,24,34.

1654
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:46,103
What's her number?

1655
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:47,278
5-5-5-2-8-2-3.

1656
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,235
Give me the phone,
give me the phone.

1657
01:28:48,279 --> 01:28:49,019
You're fucking
the ex playmate!

1658
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:50,629
It's for your own good!

1659
01:28:50,673 --> 01:28:52,109
Maybe I can get some like
emergency couples counseling.

1660
01:28:52,152 --> 01:28:53,371
- Fuck that.
- Doesn't work!

1661
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:54,459
This is good old
fashioned therapy.

1662
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:55,939
Consider it your
bachelor party.

1663
01:28:55,982 --> 01:28:57,984
Guys, how the fuck is
that going to help anything?

1664
01:28:58,028 --> 01:28:59,334
Trust us, it'll cure you.

1665
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:00,378
Get it all out of
your system at once

1666
01:29:00,422 --> 01:29:01,291
and then get
married on Saturday.

1667
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:02,859
I just don't think I should be

1668
01:29:02,902 --> 01:29:04,121
fucking any prostitutes before
I'm getting married, okay.

1669
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:06,036
I just don't see how
that's gonna help me.

1670
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,080
Through the door.

1671
01:29:07,124 --> 01:29:07,951
Down the stairs.

1672
01:29:13,217 --> 01:29:14,349
Hello, come in.

1673
01:29:32,148 --> 01:29:33,629
Are we alone in here?

1674
01:29:33,672 --> 01:29:35,892
I mean, there's nobody
else that's in here, right?

1675
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:38,503
What?

1676
01:29:38,547 --> 01:29:40,462
Are you a policeman?

1677
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:41,463
What?

1678
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:42,725
If you're a policeman

1679
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:44,074
and I ask you if
you're a policeman,

1680
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:46,206
and you say no and you
are, that's entrapment.

1681
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:49,121
Wait, speak more slowly.

1682
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:53,039
Are you a policeman?

1683
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:53,866
Wait.

1684
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:57,653
I'm Russian.

1685
01:29:57,696 --> 01:29:59,219
I no speak English good.

1686
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:00,046
You spell?

1687
01:30:02,962 --> 01:30:04,094
It's fine.

1688
01:30:04,137 --> 01:30:05,138
It's fine.

1689
01:30:05,182 --> 01:30:05,922
Nevermind, nevermind.

1690
01:30:05,965 --> 01:30:06,749
It's fine, it's fine.

1691
01:30:09,228 --> 01:30:10,927
You pay now?

1692
01:30:10,969 --> 01:30:12,710
Although I was satisfied
she actually wasn't a cop,

1693
01:30:12,755 --> 01:30:14,452
I still was fairly sure
some detective team

1694
01:30:14,496 --> 01:30:16,236
had the place bugged
and was watching

1695
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,064
from an adjacent room and
would bust me at some point.

1696
01:30:18,108 --> 01:30:20,240
I just couldn't remember
when it was actually illegal.

1697
01:30:20,284 --> 01:30:21,807
Was it after you
gave them money

1698
01:30:21,851 --> 01:30:24,331
or did you actually have
to start having sex?

1699
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,116
I just didn't know enough.

1700
01:30:31,295 --> 01:30:33,514
What's wrong with you?

1701
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:34,385
Relax.

1702
01:30:35,517 --> 01:30:36,692
Lie down.

1703
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:46,266
Take off.

1704
01:30:46,309 --> 01:30:47,267
What?

1705
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:48,704
Take off.

1706
01:30:48,746 --> 01:30:49,748
Take off what?

1707
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:50,532
Your clothes.

1708
01:30:51,707 --> 01:30:53,143
No, no, no, I'm
leaving my clothes on.

1709
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:54,405
You leave them on?

1710
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,493
I'm leaving them on.

1711
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:57,103
I just, I wanna leave them on.

1712
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:01,760
I don't have to take
any clothes off.

1713
01:31:04,807 --> 01:31:06,504
I had given the money,
wasn't arrested yet,

1714
01:31:06,548 --> 01:31:07,809
was about to have
the Russian cop

1715
01:31:07,853 --> 01:31:09,681
suck my hermetically
sealed penis,

1716
01:31:09,725 --> 01:31:12,031
when the strangest
thought flew into my head.

1717
01:31:15,121 --> 01:31:17,297
All I could think
about was Tabitha.

1718
01:31:18,559 --> 01:31:19,909
When I was now in the position,

1719
01:31:19,952 --> 01:31:21,519
I thought I must
always have the right

1720
01:31:21,563 --> 01:31:23,478
or at least the possibility
to always maintain

1721
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:25,741
all I wanted to do
was make love

1722
01:31:25,784 --> 01:31:27,482
with the woman I loved.

1723
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:29,179
All I wanted was Tabitha

1724
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:31,964
and then the epiphany
continued with a bizarre twist.

1725
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:34,010
I remembered how distraught
I had been earlier that month

1726
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:36,055
with a sudden deterioration
of my motor skills.

1727
01:31:36,099 --> 01:31:37,492
Something I thought
happened in your seventies,

1728
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:38,318
but actually happens
in your thirties.

1729
01:31:38,362 --> 01:31:40,190
Nobody tells you that.

1730
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:41,103
Yo cabbie!

1731
01:31:41,147 --> 01:31:42,844
Fucker!

1732
01:31:42,888 --> 01:31:44,629
Things I used to be able to
walk by without thinking about,

1733
01:31:44,673 --> 01:31:46,370
now, I smashed into.

1734
01:31:46,413 --> 01:31:48,327
Simple bodily functions
such as drinking beverages,

1735
01:31:48,371 --> 01:31:50,112
things I once
enjoyed with impunity

1736
01:31:50,156 --> 01:31:52,245
now required a new and
arduous concentration

1737
01:31:52,289 --> 01:31:53,638
in order to perform correctly.

1738
01:31:53,682 --> 01:31:55,205
Fucker!

1739
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:58,382
I realized that I was
afraid of getting older.

1740
01:31:58,425 --> 01:32:02,255
I realized that I
was afraid of dying

1741
01:32:03,213 --> 01:32:05,389
and the very thing
I had always wanted

1742
01:32:05,432 --> 01:32:06,564
to make a lifelong commitment

1743
01:32:06,608 --> 01:32:08,261
to a woman I loved who loved me,

1744
01:32:08,305 --> 01:32:10,219
who I could be closer to
than anyone in the world,

1745
01:32:10,263 --> 01:32:12,614
in my scared and insecure mind

1746
01:32:12,657 --> 01:32:15,268
was like the last cigarette
before the execution.

1747
01:32:15,312 --> 01:32:17,270
I mean, until death
do you part.

1748
01:32:17,314 --> 01:32:19,359
I had apparently always
seen that kind of closeness

1749
01:32:19,403 --> 01:32:22,014
that kind of love, that kind
of marriage with Tabitha

1750
01:32:22,058 --> 01:32:24,234
as equaling death,

1751
01:32:24,277 --> 01:32:26,452
but suddenly now, when
I looked into the eyes

1752
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,978
of a life with her,
I saw light.

1753
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:30,153
I saw hope.

1754
01:32:30,196 --> 01:32:31,850
I saw friendship.

1755
01:32:31,894 --> 01:32:33,852
I saw the smiles of our
unborn sons and daughters.

1756
01:32:33,896 --> 01:32:35,505
I saw possibilities
of having a life

1757
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,943
beyond my wildest dreams
and understanding,

1758
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:39,945
but I saw the hope of
one day knowing them

1759
01:32:39,989 --> 01:32:41,294
and when I looked into the eyes

1760
01:32:41,338 --> 01:32:42,687
of that eternal sexy redhead

1761
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:44,210
at that table across
the restaurant,

1762
01:32:44,254 --> 01:32:46,386
all I saw was my fear.

1763
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:48,824
I do still see an
occasionally ridiculously

1764
01:32:48,867 --> 01:32:50,173
hot sexual tryst
in the bathroom,

1765
01:32:50,216 --> 01:32:53,568
but mainly what I
saw was my fear.

1766
01:32:53,611 --> 01:32:55,395
I certainly didn't
see anything new

1767
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:58,355
and I certainly didn't see
anything nearly as magnificent

1768
01:32:58,398 --> 01:33:00,443
as the chance of having the
kind of unknown possibilities

1769
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:02,577
I saw in a life with Tabitha.

1770
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:03,577
I took the leap.

1771
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:04,448
Oh baby.

1772
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:06,102
I let it go.

1773
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:07,190
Oh God, I missed you.

1774
01:33:07,233 --> 01:33:08,407
And I was truly free.

1775
01:33:08,452 --> 01:33:09,844
Oh God, I missed you.

1776
01:33:09,888 --> 01:33:12,064
Well, that's the easy part.

1777
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:13,457
No, you don't understand.

1778
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,197
It's crystal clear.

1779
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,371
I solved everything.

1780
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:16,503
What about the problem?

1781
01:33:16,547 --> 01:33:17,287
What problem?

1782
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:19,115
You know what problem!

1783
01:33:19,157 --> 01:33:20,550
The problem that you've had

1784
01:33:20,594 --> 01:33:22,335
that's destroyed every
relationship you've ever had

1785
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:24,163
and caused us to separate.

1786
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:25,861
I mean, the fact that
you were so freaked out

1787
01:33:25,904 --> 01:33:27,253
to make love with
someone that you love,

1788
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:29,342
that we can never
have sex again.

1789
01:33:29,386 --> 01:33:30,605
I know, honey.

1790
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:31,344
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

1791
01:33:31,388 --> 01:33:32,302
That's all cured now.

1792
01:33:32,344 --> 01:33:33,520
I've cured that.

1793
01:33:33,564 --> 01:33:35,478
That will so fucking
never happen again.

1794
01:33:35,522 --> 01:33:36,523
It's not even funny.

1795
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,139
I was just about to
get my cock sucked

1796
01:33:43,182 --> 01:33:44,531
by a 14 year old Russian whore

1797
01:33:44,575 --> 01:33:47,360
and all I could
think about was you.

1798
01:33:49,885 --> 01:33:51,887
I would say that that's
better than thinking about you

1799
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:53,452
when I'm jerking off.

1800
01:33:53,496 --> 01:33:54,803
I mean, that's like
actually about to have sex

1801
01:33:54,846 --> 01:33:56,108
with a whole 'nother woman

1802
01:33:56,152 --> 01:33:57,849
and all I'm doing is
fantasizing about you.

1803
01:33:57,893 --> 01:33:59,198
You know what I'm saying?

1804
01:33:59,242 --> 01:34:00,068
Fantasizing about you
doing that stuff to me,

1805
01:34:00,112 --> 01:34:02,288
You fucking, all that, you!

1806
01:34:06,423 --> 01:34:07,684
You want me to say
something like that?

1807
01:34:07,728 --> 01:34:09,992
Is that the truth?

1808
01:34:10,035 --> 01:34:11,166
Honestly?

1809
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,385
Yeah.

1810
01:34:12,429 --> 01:34:13,343
Absolutely not.

1811
01:34:14,387 --> 01:34:15,780
That is a fucked up example

1812
01:34:15,824 --> 01:34:17,260
to try to get it into your head

1813
01:34:17,303 --> 01:34:19,523
that this is fixed now!

1814
01:34:19,566 --> 01:34:20,742
It's fixed now!

1815
01:34:20,785 --> 01:34:22,352
Honey, honey, you
just have to trust me.

1816
01:34:22,395 --> 01:34:23,266
I love you.

1817
01:34:23,309 --> 01:34:25,442
I just want to, fargan you!

1818
01:34:25,485 --> 01:34:28,575
Sweetie, I love you so much.

1819
01:34:28,619 --> 01:34:29,359
This was it.

1820
01:34:29,402 --> 01:34:30,403
It's done!

1821
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:31,796
Smashed through!

1822
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,666
Dianetics!

1823
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:36,366
I'm fixed.

1824
01:34:36,409 --> 01:34:39,325
Oh sweetheart, you have
to marry me on Saturday.

1825
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:41,066
You'll break my heart.

1826
01:34:42,764 --> 01:34:45,723
I want you to be
my wife, please.

1827
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:54,558
Say yes and we'll
fargan right now.

1828
01:34:56,168 --> 01:34:57,692
Huh.

1829
01:34:57,735 --> 01:35:01,608
Well, Mrs. Wirey Spindell,

1830
01:35:03,175 --> 01:35:07,702
has kind of a fucked
up ring to it.

1831
01:35:07,745 --> 01:35:08,528
Honey!

1832
01:35:13,184 --> 01:35:16,580
Yes, I will marry you, Wirey.

1833
01:35:18,103 --> 01:35:19,409
As my family and friends

1834
01:35:19,452 --> 01:35:21,454
assemble around
us at the wedding,

1835
01:35:21,498 --> 01:35:23,413
I couldn't help but feel
an overwhelming sense

1836
01:35:23,456 --> 01:35:24,630
of love and gratitude
for everything

1837
01:35:24,675 --> 01:35:26,459
that had happened in my life,

1838
01:35:26,503 --> 01:35:29,636
because it had brought me
to this moment in this time

1839
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,291
with these people in this
perfect God's universe.

1840
01:35:33,335 --> 01:35:35,338
As crazy as my
childhood had been,

1841
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:37,427
I was able to revel
in the joyful memories

1842
01:35:37,469 --> 01:35:39,559
that have been there too.

1843
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:42,344
My parents, being
ill-equipped to have a child,

1844
01:35:42,388 --> 01:35:44,782
being what amounted
to as kids themselves

1845
01:35:44,826 --> 01:35:46,566
had raised me with as
much love and support

1846
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:47,611
as they had to give.

1847
01:35:48,481 --> 01:35:50,309
I knew right from wrong.

1848
01:35:50,353 --> 01:35:52,311
I could tie my shoes.

1849
01:35:52,355 --> 01:35:53,878
I could look a
person in the eye.

1850
01:35:56,141 --> 01:35:58,535
They had helped turn
me into the kind of man

1851
01:35:58,577 --> 01:36:00,145
who could attract the most
wonderful woman in the world

1852
01:36:00,189 --> 01:36:01,755
into his life,

1853
01:36:01,799 --> 01:36:04,019
and more importantly,
learn how to keep her.

1854
01:36:08,023 --> 01:36:11,068
With this ring, I thee wed.

1855
01:36:14,681 --> 01:36:18,076
With this ring, I thee wed.

1856
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:22,514
By the power invested in
me by the state of New York,

1857
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:24,255
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

1858
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,518
You may kiss the bride.

1859
01:36:31,089 --> 01:36:32,047
I was on the subway last week

1860
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,570
and I sat next to this really

1861
01:36:33,612 --> 01:36:35,441
sweet old black
couple from Iowa.

1862
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,096
Guy said that they
were in New York

1863
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:40,228
celebrating their 75th
wedding anniversary.

1864
01:36:41,534 --> 01:36:43,841
I said, how'd you
know she was the one?

1865
01:36:43,885 --> 01:36:45,755
He smiled and said,
that's easy.

1866
01:36:47,018 --> 01:36:48,454
When the worst thing
that you could imagine

1867
01:36:48,498 --> 01:36:50,456
happening in the world

1868
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,719
is that something bad
would happen to her.

1869
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:59,857
I started smiling and he said,
what, you think you got her?

1870
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:04,557
I said, yeah, I got her.

1871
01:37:06,429 --> 01:37:08,387
I definitely got her.
