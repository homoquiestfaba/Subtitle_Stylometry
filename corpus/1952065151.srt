...to keep your career may

Niurka on the stage!

54
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,571
What a beautiful woman!
Who is she?

55
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,574
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- Not, as far as l know...

56
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,576
...but l warn you,
she has two sons...

57
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,578
...and she is not
what she seems.

l don't care.
l'll bring her to Mexico...

59
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,650
...to make her a star.

60
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,594

61
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,598
Thank you, Chela.
lt's a pleasure to see you again.

62
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,601
Her character is Mirta in the
soap opera ''Vivo por Elena''.

63
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,605
We need to arrange some
documents to join...

64

...the actor's unión.
Smile.

65
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,611
She's a beautiful woman,
she dances...

66
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:58,616
Dance as you used to do
in Merida. Just a little bit.

67
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,618
Perfect, just like that.

68
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,623
We have to work on her image.
Don't be shy.

69
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,626
We have to buy her
some clothes...

70
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,697
Look how her eyes shine.
Smile, please.

71
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,701
- What?
- l feel embarrassed.

72
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,637
- What about your documents?
- l feel embarrassed.

73
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,640
Don't be embarrassed.
Where is your passport?

74
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,709
Smile.

75
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,645

- Smile, girl, please.

76
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,648

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,650
- ...just do it.
- l feel ashamed.

78
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,654
Don't be! You can't feel
embarrassed while acting...

79
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,724
...before cameras.
Smile. Smile.

80
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,664
- Did she just eat?
- That can be solved.

81
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,667
- Yes, sir.
- Send her to see my dentist.

82
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,670
That's not a problem.
Don't worry about the passport.

83
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,740
Thank you very much, Juan.

84
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,676
Juan, can we have dinner

85
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,679

Her teeth.

94
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,771
You'd die for Niurka.

95
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,709
l know you,
l know you pretty well...

96
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,712
...with all respect...

97
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,716

...and very hot...

99
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,788
...with all respect.

100

l know that
l'm not handsome...

101
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,727
...or a sexy man...

102
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,798
...but what matters is money...

103
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,734
...and power solves
everything...

104
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,736
...and l have power.

105
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,807
That's why you are
a real Casanova.

106

You have your ex-wife...

107
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,745

Kena is a good mother.

111

l don't care what they say,
''Flaco''. l will support her...

116
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,843
...although they don't like it.

How did you like the songs?
They are so romantic.

00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,908
Buy a flower to...
your girlfriend.

127
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:45,842
But...

128
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,913

Tonight, your so beautiful...

Goodnight.

Let's have a toast, ''Flaquito''!

155
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,171
A toast? Why?
To whom?

156
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:11,108
To Niurka. Who else?
To Niurka, ''Flaquito''.

157
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,110
- Niurka?
- Of course!

158
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:18,115
To her beauty,
because l respected her...

159
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,186
...l didn't make love to her.
l didn't touch her.

160
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,122
Look ''Flaco'', having sex
with no reason...

161
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,192
...doesn't take you anywhere.
Anywhere.

162
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,128
There are more important
things in life.

163
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,128
Exactly.

164
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,200
Such as respecting
the woman you like so much.

165
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,202
Niurka...

166
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,205
Niurka is the
woman of my life...

167
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,208
...but she doesn't know yet.

168
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,210
Niurka...

169
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,214
She will be the mother
of my children.

170
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,230
What is this?
What is this dog doing here?

171
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,166
l am the one who feeds it.

172
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,236
Hi!

The crazy woman is here.
Shut up mother!

This is Cuban cuisine.

Where am l?

212
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,396
What a hangover!

213
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,399

214
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,672

Men are...

221
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,632
Don't say anything.

222
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,634
Men are insecure
and we are afraid of...

223
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,705
Be quiet. l better bring
you some juice.

224

Thank you.

231
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,740

You took too long.
ln Mexico you leave me so wet.

235
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,746
Niurka, l don't want
to take anybody's place...

236
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,761
...but l want this
to last very long.

237
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,768
Take the ashtray.
Take the dishes too.

238
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,706

days of my life...

239
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,775
...with you.

240
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,770
My sons are
the most important l have...

241
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,775
...but after all
you made me feel...

242
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,789
...you won a place.

243
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,792
My relationships haven't
last longer because...

244
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,795
...l don't want to get married.

245
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,731
Who told you l wanted
to get married?

246
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,801
l don't want to get married.

247
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,805
Would you like to live
with me in Mexico City?

248
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,738
ls it a joke?

249
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,808

255
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:11,768
...l've never seen you
so happy since l met you.

256
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,770
You are like another person.

257
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,841
Niurka is so pretty,
so beautiful.

258
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:21,778
When we made love
there was magic.

259
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,780
Magic! Magic!

260
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,850
- You're in love.

261
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,786

to advise you but...

262
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,857
...l don't want you to get hurt.

263
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,793

264
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,862

l will tell you last news;
Today my new family arrives.

266
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,809
This is the family
l always dreamt of.

267
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,813
Juan, you make me so happy.
How is your soap opera going?

268
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,817
lt's been approved. The name

269
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,820
- l will start it soon.

270
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,822

271
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,825
...have to be prepared.

272
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,827
...teaching you.
He's the best.

273
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,830
Bring me the best teacher.

274
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,833
...l will study.
When can we start?

275
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,837
Calm down. Calm down.

277
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,843
...and l'll be the happiest
man in the worid.

278
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,847
When l am sitting in a box
seat, the backdrop opens...

279
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,908
...third call, thanks
and claps... and success.

280
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,922
You must be the best.

281
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:55,940
Wow!

282
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,943
''Ma'', you look...

283
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,891
''Pa''...

284
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,894
Do you like the character
l am playing...

285
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,964
...in the soap opera?

286
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,901
You want to know
what l think, don't you?

287
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,937
l like it.
But you can do it better.

288
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,907
Niurka, there's something
for you.

289
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,909
Good morning happy couple.

290
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,913
That shirt suits you
very well.

291
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,984
A credit card.
l can't believe it honey!

292
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,987
l've never been given one.

293
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,922
Niurka, l see you so happy...

294
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,993
...but l feel so sad when
l think...

295
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,930
...of your little brothers
in Cuba. That breaks my heart.

296
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,000
There's something else.

297
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,003
Here it is you checkbook.

298
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,941
Your checkbook.
The first check is for me.

299
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,944
- Let's sign it.
- l'm left handed.

300
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,946
Okay. Let's see.

301
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,948
Here it goes the date,
the numbers, and here it goes...

302
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,951
...the signature,
which is the most important.

303
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,953
- ''Pa''...
- What's wrong honey?

304
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,955
- l've never used one.
- lt doesn't matter!

305
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,026
My left handed woman,
sign here.

306
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,962
<i>I should have faced
my reality and not tried...</i>

307
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,964
<i>...to avoid my responsibility.</i>

308
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,966
<i>Perhaps this was
the beginning...</i>

309
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,968
<i>...of my sentimental problems.</i>

310
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,968
Saul!

311
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,972
Mrs., l swear l don't know.

312
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,043
He's very private with his life.

313
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:44,981
l swear l will find him
no matter where he is.

314
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,984
lf l find him with a woman
l will take her hair off...

315
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,987
...and drag her around
the building.

316
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,990
- Did you hear!
- Don't be like that.

317
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,060
l'm also worried about
where he could be.

318
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,998
Look, Saul. lf he dies
it'll be your problem...

319
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,059
...and l won't rest until
l see you behind bars, bastard!

320
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,072
Yes, Madame...

321
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,007
l'll call the boss,
if he authorizes me...

322
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,077
...to take you where
he is, l will.

323
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,080
Do it! Call him!

324
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,082
Call him now!

325
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,021
Listen to me, this is
the last time l tell you...

326
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,024
...we left everything
in Merida and followed you...

327
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,026
...we are in this city alone.

328
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,029
What will we do if Juan
doesn't come back?

329
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,032
How will you pay this house?
With what money will we live?

330
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,035
Jesus!
Niurka, do something!

331
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,038
Juan still hangs out
with his friends...

332
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,108
...and spend everything
in his addiction!

333
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,044
l can't think of anything, mom!
Anything!

334
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,047
Then, let's move on.

335
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:55,051
You've known this beautiful
life everything goes well.

336
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,053
But there is more money...

337
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,055
...more luxury and comfort...

338
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,058
...and if he doesn't show up,
it doesn't matter...

339
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,061
...there are richer men
than Juan...

340
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,131
...and you can meet them.

341
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,133
No, mom.

342
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,068
l love Juan very much.

343
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,137
l love him.

344
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:18,074
''l love Juan very much.
l love him.''

345
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,076
No, Niurka!
No!

346
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,078
Think about it.

347
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,081
That bastard is destroying
the best years of your life.

348
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,083
The most valuable years.

349
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,085
Come here, honey.
Come here.

350
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,087
Look at you.

351
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,090
Look this body.
Look how pretty you are.

352
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,094
This is your time,
the time to find...

353
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,164
...a wealthy man.

354
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,098
Did you get it?

355
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,169
How stupid you are!

356
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,181
Will you tell me
where you were?

357
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,186
What do you want to know?

358
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,189
Are you still jealous?

359
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,124
How do you think...

360
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,195
...l would cheat on...

361
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,200
...a beautiful woman like you?

362
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,149
What happened?
Did you miss me?

363
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,218
A lot.

364
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,221
This little brace.

365
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,224
l like this little red
Riding-hood brace.

366
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,229
No.

367
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,246
You are being difficult,
aren't you?

368
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,264
- Calm down.
- Did you miss me?

369
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,272
l love you.

370
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,417
l got you.

371
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,287
You're mine. Mine.

372
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,623
''Ma''.

373
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,625
Do you want to sing?

374
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:50,861
What?

375
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,497
Do you want to sing?

376
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,107
l don't mind selling my house.

377
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,411
l have a lot of faith
to my wife!

378
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,614
You don't have
to sell your house.

379
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,784
l can produce
and sponsor her.

380
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,788
- Thank you, ''maestro''.
- You're welcome.

381
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:19,923
Thanks!

382
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,226
Will you be a singer?
l'm telling you...

383
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,363
...she's my daughter
and she will never sing!

384
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,563
- She will sing!
- She won't!

385
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,835
l know that because she's
my daughter. Do you understand?

386
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,904
l can't believe it!

387
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,042
Kiko, Romina,
you will fall down!

388
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,609
Niurka will do it well.
l never make mistakes.

389
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,415
l don't make mistakes either.
What's your problem?

390
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,985
Don't worry.
Don't get mad.

391
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,753
This CD...

392
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,423
...will be a success.

393
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,300
- l'm very nervous.
- Why?

394
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,303
Because l will start recording
l can't believe it.

395
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,306
With such a body
you can sing, dance...

396
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,308
...or do whatever you want.

397
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,311
Besides, l'm working on
your show. What do you think?

398
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,381
l think it's great.

399
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,384
Hey, hey!

400
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:25,321
You won't let her
sing with those kisses.

401
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,382
You're right.
But we are so happy.

402
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,396
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

403
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,336
Juan says l can be as sexy
as Marilyn Monroe...

404
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,339
...and wonderful dresses,
l can't imagine that.

405
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,343
All media and l posing like
in the photo that...

406
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:51,347
...made her famous, where
she was wearing her skirt.

407
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,349
You believed him, right?

408
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,352
What you have to do
is find a rich man...

409
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,355
...who deposits money
in your account...

410
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,425
...and leave that addict.

411
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:07,420
l'm going to be the
Mexican Marilyn Monroe.

412
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:17,774
God...

413
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,079
God...

414
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,950
l don't want to die.

415
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,654
l don't want to die.

416
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,659
l don't want to die.

417
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:42,088
You know how much
l've fought against this.

418
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,369
l can't stop drinking!

419
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,507
l love my woman.

420
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,011
l want to die!

421
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:57,881
l want to die!

422
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,585
God!

423
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,453
Help me!

424
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,759
l don't want to die!

425
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,630
l don't want to die!

426
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,510
l don't want you
to die, Juan.

427
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,512
''Ma''?

428
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,514
''Ma''?

429
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,516
Go away!

430
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,520
Go away!

431
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,525
Don't waste you life with me!

432
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,461
Go away! Leave me!

433
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,530
l'm...

434
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,533
...a piece of shit!

435
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,535
Go!

436
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,538
Go! Leave me!

437
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,561
l love you.

438
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,565
l love you.

439
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,567
''Ma''...

440
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,572
l'm sorry.
Forgive me.

441
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,577
Dear, don't ask me
to forgive you.

442
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,513
l love you very much.

443
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,583
Let's go home.

444
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,628
Juan, brother. Juan!

445
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,563
You can't helped, right?

446
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,566
l don't know what is
my daughter doing with you.

447
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,570
You're wasting her beauty!
You're wasting the best...

448
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,573
...years of her life!
Why don't you die?

449
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,642
Bastard!

450
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,577
- Keep away from this.
- She's my daughter!

451
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,579
Leave her live her life!

452
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,581
She doesn't have
a future with you.

453
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,584
There's nothing with you.
We'll end up in the street.

454
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,586
You spend everything
in that shit!

455
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,586
Mommy, please.

456
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,648
This is not the right time.
l beg you!

457
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,629
- Please, mom.
- l have to think about you.

458
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,600
l have to take care of you.
This ends here.

459
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,602
You have to fly but high.

460
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,606
- l'm sick of your scolding!
- l'm sick of you, Juan!

461
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,667
lt's not fair! You're
destroying my daughter's life!

462
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,614
lf you hate me that much...

463
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,617
- ...get out of our house!
- l'll do with my daughter!

464
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,619
- Get out!
- Niurka!

465
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,622
Niurka, please!
Please, Niurka don't go with him.

466
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,624
Please, Niurka!
Don't go away!

467
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,628
<i>If I haven't let
my mother-in-law lived with us...</i>

468
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,699
<i>...perhaps my marriage
would have succeeded.</i>

469
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,637
l take care of your sons
and your home while...

470
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,639
...you wants to become
an actress and a singer.

471
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,709
Madam, calm down!

472
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,645
He defends you!

473
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,647
What have you done
to fool him?

474
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,650
- Did you bewitched him?
- l am a lady, mom!

475
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:58,654
l'm your mother! l know
the piece of shit you are!

476
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,657
- Don't insult my wife!
- l insult her if l want to!

477
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,659
She's my daughter and
l know her very well.

478
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,661
l know the kind of woman
l have, that's why...

479
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,664
- ...l have her with me.
- l also know her well!

480
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,666
She's a brazen woman!

481
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,669
- That's a lie!
- lf you are a lady...

482
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,671
...why do you have sons
from different men?

483
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,675
Stop it! This is nonsense.
Listen what l'm telling you!

484
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,678
She will take everything
from you!

485
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,681
She will leave you
with nothing!

486
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,750
Juan!

487
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,687
Juan! Listen to me!
She will cheat on you.

488
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,689
Listen to me Juan!
Niurka!

489
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,692
Niurka, listen what
l have to say...

490
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:40,696
...she always says you are
a black and short ugly man!

491
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,767
Madam, Niurka is incapable
of saying such things...

492
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,703
- You are a liar!
- l'm not the liar, she is.

493
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,706
Tell her what you used
to do in Merida.

494
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,708
Tell him you are a whore!

495
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,711
- That's what you are, whore!
- Leave her alone.

496
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,781
You, son of a bitch!

497
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,717
Son of a bitch!
Now you're leaving!

498
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,717
Whore!

499
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,720
Bitch! Whore!

500
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,790
Bastard!

501
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,737
l can't believe
all the things she said.

502
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,740
My own mother, who carried
me for nine months.

503
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,743
We have the same blood.
l can't believe...

504
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,813
...she said such things
about me.

505
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,749
l can't believe she called
you whore.

506
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,752
She's always been like that.
When she sees me happy...

507
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,756
...she wants to destroy me!
lt's always been the same!

508
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,759
But she's so sure
when she speaks.

509
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,761
Are you going to believe her?

510
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,763
Stop the car!
Stop it or l'll jump!

511
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,765
- Wait! Calm down!
- Stop it!

512
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:53,769
- There's a car coming.
- Stop it! l don't want...

513
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,840
...to be here. Go to hell!

514
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,842
Niurka!

515
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,786
<i>My grandfather used to tell me:
''The way you see your...</i>

516
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,788
<i>...mother-in-law
your wife will be.</i>

517
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,791
- l can't believe it! l can't.
- l thought that...

518
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,793
...our relationship
would be better...

519
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,795
...when your mother
left to Cuba.

520
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:23,799
How is it going to be better
if you are always out?

521
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,801
l'm sure you're cheating
on me!

522
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,804
l'm not dating anyone.
Once again you are jealous!

523
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,875
More and more your are crazy.
You are like your mother!

524
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,811
l'm not like my mother!
Do you understand?

525
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,882
l'm not like her!
l'm not like my mother!

526
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,824
We went beyond the limits.

527
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,894
We are disrespectful!

528
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,898
This is going to hell!

529
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,835
lt's sad to tell you, Juan...

530
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,837
...but you broke your promise.

531
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,841
You did drugs again,
so you're out of the company.

532
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,844
No! Production is my life.

533
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,846
lt's the only thing
l can do.

534
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,917
- l don't want to be out!
- l don't think so.

535
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,852
You didn't keep your word.

536
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,855
We had an agreement.
There's nothing else to say.

537
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,926
You chose. You fired yourself.

538
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,930
Thank you.

539
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,949
l'm glad you're here.

540
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,885
l'll leave you a letter...

541
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,955
...but l better read it to you.

542
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,891
<i>After having had
the life I had...</i>

543
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,894
...l felt secure
and protected with you...

544
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,897
...l thought l'd win
the battle against drugs...

545
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,967
...but l realized l won't.

546
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,902
You made me feel
like a person.

547
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,904
l was a wife to you.

548
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,974
But you won't change.

549
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,977
Thank you.

550
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:16,980
Thank you very much.

551
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,916
Specially for treating me
as a person.

552
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,919
For taking care of me
and protecting me.

553
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,989
But let me tell you, Juan...

554
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,992
...this is over.

555
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,997
Don't go, ''Ma''.

556
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,000
Don't go today.

557
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,937
Just give me 24 hours.
Just that.

558
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,008
You can go tomorrow, ''Ma''.
But not today.

559
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,944
You will never change.

560
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,014
You'll do drugs.

561
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,019
That will be
your responsibility...

562
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,022
...not mine.

563
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,024
<i>God gave me serenity and
acceptance of my disease...</i>

564
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,038
<i>...and Oceanica my recovery.</i>

565
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,976
lt's horrible to feel
that the person you love...

566
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,046
...is going away.

567
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,982
lt's horrible to know
that you cannot have him...

568
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,984
...around your arms.

569
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,986
And l love him so much.

570
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,056
How can l save him?

571
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,058
l can't.

572
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,062
Thank you...

573
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,068
Thank you, because
l can believe...

574
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,072
...that he is with me.

575
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,077
l can see him smile...

576
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,079
...see him walk...

577
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:01,016
...and move on. That's
the only thing l want to see.

578
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,086
The only thing l care of.

579
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,022
l believe there's a God.

580
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,025
l believe he can make it...

581
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,095
...because you are great.

582
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,098
l'm happy...

583
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,102
...because l have him again.

584
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,115
Let's go home, ''Ma''.

585
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,117
Let's go home.

586
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,063
- Guess what?
- You tell me. l hate guessing.

587
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,066
l got another opportunity
in Televisa.

588
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,069
- When will you start?
- l don't know...

589
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:57,140
...l have several projects.
l'll see tomorrow.

590
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,075
Did you see what you got
for leaving drugs?

591
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,077
l know.

592
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:06,081
And guess what?
l will help other addicts.

593
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:10,085
l will give lectures about
addictions. l'll do my best...

594
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:13,156
...so that children don't
have this problem.

595
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,092
Do whatever you want.
l'll be with you.

596
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:21,153
Guess what?
You have your first play.

597
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,167
You will be starring!

598
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,170
The name will be:

599
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,173
''Una viuda sin sosten''.

600
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,176
- ''Pa''.
- ''Ma''.

601
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,180
What do you think?

602
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,116
What did l tell you?
Do you remember...

603
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,118
...what l told you
long time ago?

604
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,120
l told you l'd be sitting
on a box seat...

605
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:49,124
...you and the theater,
and claps, and success.

606
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,193
''Pa''...

607
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,128
...do you think
l'll do it well?

608
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,130
Sure! You've been
rehearsing for a month...

609
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,132
...and you do it fine.
Don't worry.

610
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,202
l'm not worry...

611
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,205
...l will win the audience.

612
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,210
Thank you for your support.

613
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,145
<i>First call.</i>

614
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,148
l'll get changed.
l don't want to be late.

615
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,218
Wait, wait, wait...

616
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,220

617
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,230
l love you Juan,
with all my heart.

618
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,233
l love you too, Niurka.

619
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,235
''Ma''.

620
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,237
Yes, ''Pa''?

621
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,242
You fascinate me.

622
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,245
- You drive me crazy.
- l love you.

623
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,250
You know l'm very
proud of you.

624
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,227
- Hi, Mimi.
- How are you, Mrs.?

625
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,229
- How are you?
- Good.

626
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,232
Honey, l came to pick
my scripts.

627
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,234
l hope to perform from the
beginning of the soap opera.

628
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,237
As soon as your character
appears you'll perform.

629
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,239
lt will be decided tomorrow.

630
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:48,243
Why, honey? lf you are the
boss here. You can decide...

631
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,246
...about my performing since
the beginning of the soap opera.

632
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,248
Why are you in such a hurry?

633
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,250
- Because...
- Tell me why.

634
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,252
l don't want to be
in ''Aventurera'' anymore.

635
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:01,256
What do you say?
You didn't mention a word.

636
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,258
l didn't want
to preoccupied you.

637
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,260
The truth is l'm not happy
with Carmen.

638
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,262
Wait a second!

639
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,265
You can't leave
the theater season.

640
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,267
What about your image?

641
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,269
You are a professional,
remember that.

642
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,272
l'm going to help you but
you will finish the season.

643
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:20,275
l can't stand Carmen Salinas.
l'm fed up with it!

644
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:24,279
- l hate working with her!
- Niurka!

645
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,279
Enough!

646
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,283
What happens to you?
What happens to you?

647
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,286
Calm down. First of all,
don't shout...

648
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,357
...and don't criticize
your work mates. Calm down.

649
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,361
Take it easy.
What a character!

650
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,364
Okay, ''Pa''.

651
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,300
Promise you'll help
through all of this.

652
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,304
Of course that's why l'm here.
l'll protect you...

653
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:53,365
...and love you but you,
you will finish ''Aventurera''.

654
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:13,328
Give me those beautiful legs
which l will insure soon.

655
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,330
Here it is your tonic.

656
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:19,391
lt contains the most important
and the most delicious.

657
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,405
Be careful, it's hot.

658
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,408
Very good.

659
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,342
Did you like it?

660
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:32,347
''Pa'', more and more
your soups are better.

661
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,417
l'm a better cook.

662
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,352
Honey, if it wasn't for you
l wouldn't have...

663
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,422
...finished ''Aventurera''.

664
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,358
Today l hired Edith Gonzalez...

665
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,361
...to star ''Salome''.

666
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,422
l also told her that Niurka
will be Karicia.

667
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,368
Very good, boss.

668
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,439
Don't worry about Niurka,
she will be...

669
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:00,375
Congratulations
for our new soap opera.

670
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,377
l want to tell you something...

671
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,379
...but it makes me feel
embarrassed...

672
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:07,450
...l think ''Salome''
fits me like a glove.

673
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:12,387
You're great in ''Aventurera''
but theater and televisión...

674
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,390
- ...are two different things.
- l was a cabaret girl...

675
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,393
...l know how difficult
the environment is.

676
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,395
- That's why l was so tough.
- You're tough.

677
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:25,400
Let me tell you something,
once l was about to tear off...

678
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,403
...a girl's ear at the cabaret.

679
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,405
She wanted to fight because...

680
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:34,466
...she thought l was
flirting with her husband.

681
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,412
Were you flirting with him?

682
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,415
Me? l have never had
to do that.

683
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,417
l've always had men
wanting to be with me.

684
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,487
Since l met you...

685
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,420
...l fell...

686
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,492
...in love with you.

687
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,496
Oh, ''Ma''!
Oh, ''Ma''!

688
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:55,429
''Pa''...

689
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,500
Do you trust me
to play ''Salome''?

690
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,507
You never give up, don't you?

691
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,446
<i>How difficult is to keep
feelings away...</i>

692
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,448
<i>...from professional life
and don't get...</i>

693
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,518
<i>...to pleased your mate.</i>

694
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,283
What does that blond girl
have that l don't?

695
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,793
A career. She's got a career.

696
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:30,457
Besides, Karicia's character
is very nice. You'll like it.

697
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,535
l don't like the idea.

698
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,805
You forgot. You forgot
that you was given...

699
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,137
...an opportunity at the office.

700
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,302
You filmed
a small sentence...

701
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,573
...and you were so happy.

702
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,376
Very happy!

703
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,212
You have to trust me!
Please!

704
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,887
l'm being stupid, right?
You're right.

705
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,886
There isn't any small
character for me...

706
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,560
...because l'm a very
good actress.

707
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,467
They look very good together,
don't they?

708
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:15,670
Boss, rivalry between them
is growing.

709
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,646
l know but Edith is
a professional.

710
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,511
She hasn't said a word...

711
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,517
...that's why we've
been able to work.

712
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,520
You and l were about to
break our friendship...

713
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,523
...at the beginning of the
soap opera because of...

714
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,024
...Niurka's comments.

715
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,185
Sit down there, boss...

716
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,196
- ...you're the chief!
- lt's difficult to keep a balance.

717
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:38,028
Look, l'll tell you something...

718
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,295
...l will support my wife...

719
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,038
...but we won't take the star
the importance she has.

720
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,576
l hope this doesn't end my
friendship with Edith.

721
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,744
The suitcases are
very heavy.

722
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,813
l wouldn't change this moment
for anything in the worid.

723
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,786
Look at your face.
You are happy.

724
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,459
- l'm very happy.
- Can you imagine being able...

725
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,754
...to come back to Cuba
after long time?

726
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,864
Did you like the surprise?
Tell me.

727
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:14,025
l loved it. l loved it.
After all we went through...

728
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,897
...with my mom you
brought me to see her.

729
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:20,806
Of course. Family comes first.
She's your mother. Love her.

730
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,971
Thank you, ''Pa''.

731
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,745
l love you so much.

732
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:29,042
l love you too...for bringing
this heavy suitcases.

733
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,216
Look, my arms
are getting longer.

734
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,879
- Your documents, sir.
- Sure. How are you officer?

735
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:38,490
- You come together?
- Yes, we're together.

736
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,293
Your luggage.

737
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,123
He's checking my documents.

738
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,332
- There's no problem.
- Your luggage.

739
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,064
- You want to check it again.
- Your luggage!

740
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,541
Boy, don't check it again.

741
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,404
Of course, officer.

742
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,405
Here you are.

743
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,614
Calm down, honey.

744
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:04,242
l'm with you.
Anything will happen.

745
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,695
lt's so wonderful you came
to visit the family.

746
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,972
Mom, Juan insisted to come
and see you.

747
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:29,306
That's great, honey.
Everybody says you look great.

748
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,903
They are happy with
the soap opera and...

749
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,575
...you look pretty with
those dresses and dances...

750
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,386
What do you think about
your mother-in-law?

751
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,882
Mommy, l'm so happy. The only
problem l have is that blonde.

752
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,481
Even she's so educated and
she speaks English...

753
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,992
l can't stand that bitch.

754
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,153
My girl and her
beautiful expressions.

755
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,322
Netito and everybody love
both of you...

756
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:52,424
...you are such good people.
And besides you brought things.

757
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,025
l love all you gave me.

758
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:58,164
You know, we'll rent a van so
all we can head to the beach...

759
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,401
...you will get a tan.

760
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,738
- How are you, Celeste?
- How are you, man!

761
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:11,177
You can't imagine how many
times l dreamt of this moment...

762
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:15,348
...coming to Cuba and bringing
all those presents to my mom.

763
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,688
l will never forget this moment.

764
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:21,525
The bad thing is that we have
to come back because...

765
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:26,034
- ...we don't have much time.
- Thank you for taking me here.

766
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,696
And thank you for giving me
a day off from my job.

767
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:34,368
- l just wanted to see you happy.
- lmagine, to see my family...

768
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,708
...makes me so happy. To go
to the places l loved...

769
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,442
...when l was a girl: ''La
Bodeguita'', ''El Morro''...

770
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,115
Can l tell you something?

771
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,824
Calm down, girl.
Calm down, baby.

772
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,269
Tom s, call my husband, please.

773
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,739
Why would you hire a girl
who came from a reality show...

774
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,036
...if there are so many
actresses?

775
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,869
Well...wait a second.

776
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,213
- Hello.
- Where are you?

777
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,282
Hi, ''Ma''.

778
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:53,446
l'm happy for all the
controversy about ''La Mapacha''

779
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,957
Tell them that it's
a strategy to get rating...

780
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,461
...because if l catch you
with another girl...

781
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:05,193
...l will drag her
around the building.

782
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,797
l'm with Alejandro Fagoaga,
he's interviewing me.

783
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,463
l'll put him on the phone.

784
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,302
Hi Niurka, how are you?

785
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,138
Yes, it's me Alejandro
Fagoaga. Perhaps you could...

786
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,303
...give us some minutes
for an interview.

787
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:21,315
- Here it is your husband.
- What's up honey?

788
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:25,854
l see you later, and have
lunch in our new house.

789
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,687
Kisses, honey.

790
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:34,491
- Juan, she marks your time.
- lt's love.

791
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,828
l don't know if it's just my
imaginations but...

792
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:41,495
...l want you to see what he's
doing with ''La Mapacha''.

793
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:42,502
Calm down.

794
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,334
Hector, stop it!

795
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,566
Don't move.

796
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,410
''Ma'', come.

797
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,015
Come here.

798
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,585
No, honey. lt's too cold.

799
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,392
Come here. lt's very nice.
Look!

800
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,629
See?

801
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,296
Come, anything will happen.

802
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:49,464
l'll take care of you.
Come my girl.

803
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,969
Come honey.

804
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,308
Come. Yes?

805
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,970
Give me a kiss.

806
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,643
Give me a kiss, honey.

807
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,970
Congratulations to both
of you.

808
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,701
Don't worry about Niurka, we'll
take care of her on Salome.

809
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,037
Our life will change radically.

810
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,547
Yes, honey.

811
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,646
Our lives have been
like a plane...

812
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,482
...a plane that flies
and flies...

813
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:21,655
...but this love
event makes us land.

814
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,961
Besides, you have friends who
care about you...

815
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:28,730
...and we will take care
of Niurka and the baby.

816
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,000
Yes, boss, count on us.

817
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,005
l got to go.

818
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:34,076
- l have to work.
- Of course.

819
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,388
This fountain
is in your honor.

820
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,093
This cage with birds...

821
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:52,783
...too.

822
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,094
Both will be here forever...

823
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,097
...whether we are
together or not.

824
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,766
Oh, baby...

825
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:05,107
That's why l thank God...

826
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,101
...for our child.

827
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,082
lt's a very loved child.
He's not born yet...

828
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,814
...and there are
lots of flowers.

829
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,787
Of course.
Of course.

830
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:25,619
She's a queen
and we will spoil her.

831
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,959
Careful.
Careful.

832
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,464
You're so beautiful.

833
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,899
The suitcase is too big
for you and the baby, Ms.

834
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,637
The suitcase belongs
to both of us.

835
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,670
l'm also getting interned.

836
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,079
We both will have the baby.

837
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:52,143
- l love you so much.
- l love you too.

838
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,824
We'll go to the OR in
5 minutes.

839
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,778
Honey, our baby is coming.

840
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,181
Our baby is coming.

841
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:28,448
When he's born take him with
you. He could be stolen.

842
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,856
No, no. Don't worry.

843
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,192
Everything is fine.

844
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,700
You're very brave.
Very brave.

845
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,534
Look, Juan.

846
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,537
lt's a boy, Juan.

847
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:16,905
Look.

848
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:18,903
Look, honey.

849
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:22,843
l have him here.

850
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:23,912
Look at him.

851
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,915
He's our son.

852
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,253
He's our son.

853
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,248
He's beautiful, honey.

854
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,143
Let me go.

855
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,051
ln the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

856
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,191
God bless you.

857
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,529
<i>''Ma'', I'm going to work.</i>

858
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,728
Where are you?

859
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,307
''Ma''?

860
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:00,675
''Ma''?

861
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,073
What happens honey?

862
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:05,810
What happens to you?

863
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,483
Are you okay?

864
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,619
Tell me.
What's wrong?

865
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,214
What happens?

866
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,193
l'm ugly, right?

867
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,625
l'm sad.

868
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,632
''Pa'', you don't love me
anymore, do you?

869
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:36,643
l love you, honey.
Of course l love you.

870
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:40,044
Honey, l adore you.

871
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:43,976
You are sad.

872
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:44,814
Listen...

873
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,324
You know, how important
it is for a woman...

874
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:54,658
...to have a baby.
A baby inside of them.

875
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:59,666
You know how many women
can't have babies.

876
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,998
There are thousands
around the worid.

877
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,731
But you can have them.

878
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:06,999
Look at me.

879
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:11,307
Do you know how many men like
me are so happy...

880
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:15,406
...because a woman like you
gave us a baby?

881
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,747
Life that gives life.

882
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:21,756
Honey...

883
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,691
...please understand...

884
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:30,425
...this is the last time
you are going to be pregnant.

885
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:34,766
Don't feel like that.
You are a queen.

886
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,127
l love you.

887
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,767
l love you.

888
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,116
lt's okay. lt's okay.

889
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,733
''Velo de Novia''
is a good title.

890
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,738
The only thing
we want to ask you...

891
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,536
...is not to have your wife
in the soap opera.

892
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:18,739
No! We can't stop her career!
Please!

893
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,476
lt's not possible to have
Niurka in every soap opera.

894
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,319
l hope l was clear.

895
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,760
Do your best. This body
must be beautiful.

896
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,925
l'm sure my husband will
give me a surprise.

897
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,129
You've always been
very pretty.

898
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,436
You've always been a star.
lt doesn't seem...

899
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,100
...you just had a baby.

900
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,144
l will go to the gym, you
know why...

901
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,840
...to star his next
soap opera.

902
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,183
- Hi, ''ma''.
- Hi, honey.

903
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,913
How is your soap opera doing?

904
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,113
You're smoking. l told you...

905
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,520
...not to smoke.
l'll see Emilio.

906
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:04,856
What a pretty woman.

907
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,530
See? l'm sure. l'm sure.

908
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:18,537
Your negotiation was very
skillful to make Niurka perform...

909
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,632
- ...in the soap opera.
- Thank you, sir.

910
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,802
l want to ask you a favor.

911
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:26,142
Could you call her
and tell her the news?

912
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,546
- She's going to be happier.
- Okay.

913
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:32,312
lt's your responsibility.
Even she's your wife...

914
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:35,219
...she can't have more
privileges than others.

915
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,887
Juan, produce with your brain
not with your heart.

916
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,225
- You know how to succeed.
- Thank you.

917
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,563
Thank you.
You make me feel so well.

918
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:49,665
You're not only my boss,
you are a great friend.

919
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,002
Don't worry about
the soap opera...

920
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,075
...it's going to be
very successful!

921
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,308
Thank you St. Jude.

922
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,903
Thank you.

923
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,245
That l won't be starring
''Velo de Novia''?

924
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,915
l have anything
against Susana...

925
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,186
...but l deserve to star it.

926
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:14,194
Being the producer's wife
makes everything go slower.

927
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,526
lt's not fair!
l've worked very hard.

928
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,190
l'm getting older...

929
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,531
...and those characters are
given to stupid giris!

930
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:24,868
Honey, this is your
opportunity to grow...

931
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:27,874
...so people believe
in you and star. Understand?

932
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,308
The character is great.

933
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:32,875
Look, she's a taxi driver...

934
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,539
...from the countryside, brave...

935
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,878
...she's got a family...

936
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,212
...and, guess what?

937
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,219
She also has her
love story.

938
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,619
Just don't cheat on me.

939
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,621
Don't you trust me?

940
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,560
Of course l do.

941
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,062
lt's just the company's policy.

942
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:53,225
They don't want the actress
has problems with the producer.

943
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,132
lt's a company's policy, right!

944
01:12:55,337 --> 01:13:00,240
Tell me who didn't want me
to star the soap opera?

945
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,640
Tell me and l will
convince them! Tell me!

946
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,576
Things aren't the way you think.

947
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,578
Understand?

948
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,148
So it's you.

949
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,317
You don't want
me to star it!

950
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:10,916
Listen to me.

951
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,919
l already explained
it to you.

952
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,581
lf you don't like it
don't do it.

953
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,249
Don't do it!

954
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:18,656
As simple as that.

955
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:24,325
''Pa'', promise it'll be
something important.

956
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:26,664
Okay, okay.

957
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,860
The character is a
brave taxi driver...

958
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,405
Can l be called ''Vida''?

959
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:39,275
<i>It's going to be very nice
with all the lighting and...</i>

960
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,348
...the rain.

961
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:42,945
And the 136...

962
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:46,179
''Pa'', look at me.

963
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:48,019
What's this?

964
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,954
You can't wear
long nails, Niurka.

965
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,549
Neither clothes like that!

966
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,788
That's not your character.
You'd be assaulted.

967
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:56,956
l agree. l thought you'd
authorized it.

968
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,625
Besides... it's not the
character's psychology.

969
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,295
Do you want me to dress
like a nun.

970
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:05,396
lf there's a problem with
my nails, l will take them off.

971
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,407
Bring me a pair of
scissors, please.

972
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:10,307
Your character is a taxi
driver, a taxi driver.

973
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,210
You come from a little town.
You'll change tires and...

974
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:16,148
...get your hands dirty,
you'll fix the car engine.

975
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,651
All your passengers are men!

976
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,585
You won't be dressing like that!

977
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,657
What's wrong with it?

978
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:26,387
l'm telling you it doesn't
goes with your character.

979
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,056
Sir, sir...

980
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:32,695
''Profe'', we will film...

981
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,668
...the scene the way
she's wearing...

982
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:39,673
...then we'll see where
we can change her appearance.

983
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,402
Yes, sir.
As you wish.

984
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,418
Hi, Emilio.

985
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:58,760
Forgive me for not seeing you
all day long.

986
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:04,258
Yes, dad is working.

987
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,099
l know that dad and mom
aren't very close...

988
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:12,407
...because of problems
and pressures...

989
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,705
...but we'll always have
time for you.

990
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,779
You're hungry, aren't you?

991
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,782
How heavy you are, my son.

992
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:27,119
My dear father-in-law, l wanted
you to be in Emilio's baptism.

993
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:32,282
l cooked spaghetti
the way you like.

994
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,421
Emilio needed you.

995
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,859
l know, my girl.

996
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,802
l have this damned disease.

997
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,570
- Every time l feel like dying.
- Give me a break.

998
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,736
Don't talk nonsense.
You're always saying that.

999
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,473
lt's true, woman.

1000
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,749
l'm so happy to see...

1001
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:59,810
...the beautiful family you
and Juan have started.

1002
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:05,482
We as parents always ask God
for a good woman...

1003
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,386
...to their sons
to take care of them...

1004
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,488
...and support them forever.

1005
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,103
Emilio, God bless you.

1006
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,641
l hope you keep
your parent's love...

1007
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:23,176
...when you're older.

1008
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,112
And you Niurka, be a good
woman and a good mother...

1009
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,310
...to your sons.

1010
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:37,188
Don't let anybody disturb your
marriage or your family.

1011
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,194
Well...

1012
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,697
...l'm going to bed.
l'm very tired.

1013
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:45,533
Son...

1014
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:55,206
- l love you daddy.
- l love you too.

1015
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,204
l love you too.

1016
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:59,213
Come on, honey.

1017
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:17,726
Juanito!

1018
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,091
Hi, honey!

1019
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,627
Welcome home, Juanito!

1020
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,365
- ''Velo de Novia''.
- What do you think?

1021
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:30,804
l thought you were joking
when you asked me...

1022
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,847
...to perform in your
new soap opera.

1023
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,642
- No way.
- That's nice, Juanito.

1024
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,218
l want Sergio Jimenez
be the director.

1025
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,117
- As you wish.
- He's great.

1026
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,148
Whatever you want.
You can do whatever...

1027
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,953
...you want to the character.
You're great.

1028
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:51,524
l just want to tell you, Juanito,
remember that ''Aventurera''...

1029
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,928
...is my priority.
We'll go out of the city.

1030
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,227
But you know about it.

1031
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,337
You're always with us.

1032
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,474
- You know l love you very much.
- And l love you too.

1033
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:06,172
l don't forget you were one
of my son Pedrito's best friend.

1034
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,612
Before passing away, he went
to say goodbye.

1035
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:10,979
- Remember?
- Of course.

1036
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:12,416
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1037
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,423
Hello.

1038
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:31,635
ls something wrong?

1039
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:33,565
What happened, Juanito?

1040
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,734
ls something wrong?
Are feeling well?

1041
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:36,970
Bad news, Juanito?

1042
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,239
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

1043
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,578
- What happened?
- Calm down.

1044
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,083
We are here.
What happens?

1045
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,949
My dad just passed away.

1046
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,246
Calm down, Juanito.

1047
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,653
Sit down.

1048
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:52,994
My mom.

1049
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,260
What are we going
to tell my mother?

1050
01:18:57,365 --> 01:18:59,595
You have to calm down.

1051
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:02,602
Who will give the bad news
to your mother and sisters.

1052
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:05,002
Calm down, son.
Take it easy.

1053
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,350
l want to ask everybody
to go out.

1054
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:30,122
l want to be with my siblings.

1055
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,359
We will say goodbye
to my father.

1056
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,367
Don't go out Niurka...

1057
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:43,033
You know my father
loved you as a daughter.

1058
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,380
Goodbye, dear father-in-law.

1059
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:54,715
We will miss you a lot.

1060
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,055
Your grandchildren
love you.

1061
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,725
Go to heaven.

1062
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,058
God bless you.

1063
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,407
Like my mother says...

1064
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,082
...life will be difficult
without my father...

1065
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,758
...and he doesn't want
us to cry...

1066
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:34,094
...because tears
are resentment...

1067
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:38,762
...and pain...

1068
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,766
...and we have to move on.

1069
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,138
How does life is?

1070
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,606
l don't know how life is.

1071
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,780
lt took my father from me...

1072
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,781
...and gave me a son.

1073
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:27,406
<i>My father's death is an
emptiness I'll never fill...</i>

1074
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,574
<i>...but life goes on.</i>

1075
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,747
No, boss, no, no.

1076
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,413
Niurka asked me
to give her more scripts...

1077
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,251
...to Mr. Larios!
No!

1078
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,486
He's not an actor
and never will!

1079
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:42,090
He lacks of energy.

1080
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:47,499
l have to be asking to bring
some food to him!

1081
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:53,341
''Profe''...

1082
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,946
The soap opera is going
very well. lt's improved a lot.

1083
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,778
Now is the time to make
changes and an ending.

1084
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,112
What changes?

1085
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:06,779
- What ending?
- You're the writer...

1086
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,186
...you are the soap opera's
genius.

1087
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,192
Yes, Juan, l'm the writer.
But l don't want more changes.

1088
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:14,785
That Niurka wants
this or that...

1089
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:18,457
...that this guy, that is not actor
wants some more scripts...

1090
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:20,193
...l'm tired of it.

1091
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:24,970
l can't talk to Juan.

1092
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:29,134
l told him to film Beto and
Vida in more sexual scenes...

1093
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,678
...but he doesn't understand.
l can't believe it.

1094
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,044
Shut up, please.
Don't talk to me like that.

1095
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,549
- l'll come back later.
- Go away too!

1096
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,556
Bobby is so lonely.

1097
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,221
He has nobody listen to him...

1098
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,154
...and he's so cute.

1099
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,165
Yes, baby, he's very cute...

1100
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:55,566
...you're giving him importance,
and they could realize.

1101
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:58,068
And everything
would be spoiled.

1102
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,639
You remember my birthday.

1103
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,474
lt's also Emilio's...

1104
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,412
...our son.

1105
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:16,746
What a coincidence to
be born in the same day.

1106
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:19,319
But we have to share presents.
Let me see.

1107
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:25,993
Look...

1108
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,325
...but you, ''Ma''...

1109
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,831
...you are my queen.

1110
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:32,499
My queen.

1111
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:42,669
Listen, ''Ma''...

1112
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:46,605
...l want to visit
Gloria in jail in Chihuahua.

1113
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:48,409
After all that it's been said.

1114
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:50,313
l would be close to that people.

1115
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,852
And you shouldn't do it.
lt's not good for us.

1116
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:55,946
''Ma'', it was very difficult
to get an appointment...

1117
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,458
...besides l've been very close
to her since she left Brazil.

1118
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,995
l'm sure she's innocent.

1119
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,288
l want to offer her
a soap opera.

1120
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,699
That could stain our reputation.
Understand, please.

1121
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,628
l don't trust Gloria.

1122
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,467
Because you don't know her.

1123
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:15,475
Sergio Andrade's problem
is an enigma.

1124
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:16,976
Nobody know the truth.

1125
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:18,807
But let me tell you something...

1126
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:20,972
...let me take you with me...

1127
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:23,983
...you get to know her and if
you don't trust her...

1128
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,883
...we forget the project
with her. What do you think?

1129
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,893
Hi, ''Ma'', l'm home.

1130
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:38,395
How are you?

1131
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,063
l'm tired.

1132
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:44,504
Guess what?
Don't say a word to anybody.

1133
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,665
l have the ending
of the soap opera.

1134
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:48,332
lt's great.
Great!

1135
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:49,671
Picture this.

1136
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:51,677
Everything
happens at the sea.

1137
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,373
There's a violent persecution
there's a chopper...

1138
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,347
...it shoots and Santamarina...

1139
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:58,180
...rescues you
and become a hero.

1140
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,378
What do you think?

1141
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,921
Who had the idea that
Santamarina rescue me?

1142
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:04,014
The writers and l.

1143
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,184
The one who should
rescue me is Beto.

1144
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:11,023
The one who should rescue you
is the starring character.

1145
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:13,032
That's what characters
are for...

1146
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,364
...to be heroes.

1147
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,404
Your character
is important because...

1148
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,097
...you will end marrying him.

1149
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:21,442
You don't convince me!

1150
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:25,108
The one who should rescue me
is Bobby, l mean, Beto.

1151
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:30,045
Don't misunderstand
what l say.

1152
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:32,381
l'm talking on behalf of
an actor who...

1153
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:34,648
...doesn't have a person
to care about him.

1154
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:35,950
lt's logical is...

1155
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:39,722
...if he is the one rescuing
me because l love him.

1156
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,158
l mean Vida loves him.

1157
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:45,966
Bobby must rescue me.

1158
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,301
l'm going to work.

1159
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,135
l hope you change the script.

1160
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,841
Honey, l'm glad you're here.

1161
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,111
Wait, wait.

1162
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,523
l'm watching the news.

1163
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:29,555
You are watching the news,
and l'm here masturbating!

1164
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,925
Calm down. Are you crazy?

1165
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:36,203
Crazy? Crazy is your
fucking mother's ass!

1166
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:42,635
How is it possible that a
man has a woman like me...

1167
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:47,337
...and doesn't realize.
You prefer to watch the news...

1168
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,076
...instead of fucking me.
How is that?

1169
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,882
Because the only thing
you want is sex!

1170
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,813
Sex, only sex.

1171
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:58,523
What about making love?

1172
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:02,385
What about caress
and romance?

1173
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,931
Making love is a pleasure
not an obligation!

1174
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,201
Not everything is just
to fornicate.

1175
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:10,603
l'm sick of it!

1176
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:14,167
Don't you like my teats?

1177
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:18,072
Don't you like my ass?

1178
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:21,342
All men want my body.

1179
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,608
l'm sick of you!

1180
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:26,448
You are sick of a man who
has loved you and...

1181
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,181
...given you everything!

1182
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:30,884
Who is a faithful man...

1183
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:34,018
...and he's good father
to your sons!

1184
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,958
Now that you're successful
you are sick of it!

1185
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,964
Do you want to talk?
Let's talk!

1186
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,192
Come on.

1187
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,895
l'm fed up!

1188
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,034
l'm fed up!

1189
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,073
l think we should break up.

1190
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,202
That's what you think.

1191
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:53,972
l will fight for this marriage!

1192
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:55,882
l'll fight for it!

1193
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:02,017
You have to let him go to his
appointment in ''Aventurera''.

1194
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,589
l'm sorry but Bobby didn't ask
for permissión he can't leave.

1195
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:06,951
Don't be an idiot.

1196
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:09,428
Everybody is rubbing
Juan's balls!

1197
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:13,398
l warn you. lf you don't
do what l'm telling you...

1198
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:15,795
...l will ask him
to fire you!

1199
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:17,630
Honey...

1200
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:19,430
That was too much.

1201
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:22,408
Poor Bobby, this is
the first job he gets...

1202
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:25,143
...and this assholes
wouldn't let him go out.

1203
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,310
lf you talk to your husband?

1204
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:30,746
You were right, Jorge.
Here we need discipline.

1205
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:34,078
lf Bobby didn't ask for
permissión he can't go.

1206
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,654
Even my wife...

1207
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,518
She must ask for permissión!
Understand?

1208
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,989
That's what l told
Niurka, sir...

1209
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,526
...but she went
to talk to Martha.

1210
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:45,160
Why she do that?

1211
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:47,427
She knows what we have to do.

1212
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:50,669
We're under pressure.
lt's the end of the soap opera.

1213
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,671
Get the pending business.

1214
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:54,365
Jorge!

1215
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,802
lf you can help him do it.

1216
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,477
Niurka, Niurka!

1217
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:09,055
Hi.

1218
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,254
Look what l have here.

1219
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,189
Here it is the song, ''Ma''.

1220
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:17,655
She is going to be the first one
to listen to it.

1221
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:21,196
l don't want to travel.
l have a bad feeling.

1222
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:23,096
l feel l shouldn't go.

1223
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:26,636
How weird. You love
travelling with me.

1224
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,675
l don't want to go.

1225
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:32,409
l'm leaving on Sunday.
l hope you change your mind.

1226
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,581
l'd love to go
with you.

1227
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:40,183
l've asked you not to
smoke here.

1228
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,452
l found an ashtray.

1229
01:32:58,105 --> 01:32:59,333
l'm going to hurry.

1230
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,670
l don't want to miss
the plane.

1231
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:04,539
- How bad l'm feeling.
- Hi, honey.

1232
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,408
Do you have to
go to Chihuahua?

1233
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,214
Or you aren't going.

1234
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:10,875
l'd like to go with you.

1235
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:14,576
...but l have to be here when
Romina leaves to Merida...

1236
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:16,789
...and l can't be away.

1237
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,382
What if l cancel the trip?

1238
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:21,256
Are you crazy?
You have to see Gloria Trevi.

1239
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,659
lmagine how lonely
she feels in jail.

1240
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:25,923
You can't do that to Gloria.

1241
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:28,297
You're right.
You're right.

1242
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:32,167
l'm going to hurry. And
l'll give her the present.

1243
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:36,776
Honey, tell her l'm very happy
for the song she gave me.

1244
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:39,277
- Of course.
- Can l help you with something?

1245
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,415
No, thank you.
Don't worry.

1246
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,453
Why am l feeling so bad?

1247
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,218
You know why, Juan.

1248
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:08,901
Maria, can
l talk to my wife?

1249
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:11,870
She's not here, sir.
She went out.

1250
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,571
Do you know where she is?

1251
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:16,079
She didn't tell me but
the moment you left...

1252
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:18,344
...she took a shower,
get dressed...

1253
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:19,578
...and she left too.

1254
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:21,353
lt was around 9:30.

1255
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:24,583
Do you want me to tell her
you're looking for her?

1256
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:26,926
No, thank you.

1257
01:34:29,797 --> 01:34:32,527
Good afternoon.
Sorry for the interruption...

1258
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:34,066
...you don't know me...

1259
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,159
<i>...I'm Bobby's ex-wife.</i>

1260
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,534
<i>You and I were betrayed...</i>

1261
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,233
...but l'm being loosing my
reputation as a mother...

1262
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:45,210
l know, l know, please
understand me.

1263
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:46,870
<i>I feel desperate.</i>

1264
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,541
<i>I haven't seen my son
for more than a year.</i>

1265
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,550
l'd do anything for him.

1266
01:34:51,652 --> 01:34:53,119
l'd give my life.

1267
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:55,816
Yes, l know.

1268
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,982
l've receive some messages...

1269
01:34:58,092 --> 01:34:59,889
...that l wouldn't dare
to show you.

1270
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,621
l'm ashamed.

1271
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:03,964
Yes, sir.

1272
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:07,297
Thank you very much, sir.

1273
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:10,561
Thank you for listening.

1274
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,229
Of course.
Of course yes.

1275
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:13,636
Bye.

1276
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:20,242
SHE DOESN'T NEED HlM WlTH
THE GOOD SUCKS SHE GlVES ME

1277
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:24,977
AND l CAN RECOMMEND YOU
TO FUCK OUT OF HERE.

1278
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:28,249
We have to talk!

1279
01:35:28,355 --> 01:35:30,550
What for?
Why should we hurt each other?

1280
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:33,718
l haven't hurt you. l've
given you everything!

1281
01:35:33,828 --> 01:35:37,264
- Don't play a martyr.
- l'm not playing a martyr.

1282
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:39,559
l just don't want to
be arguing with you.

1283
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:41,259
We are civilized people.

1284
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:43,165
Say something...

1285
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:45,431
...l think this
relationship is over!

1286
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:46,665
lt is time...

1287
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:50,602
lt's time to recover all
we have been working for!

1288
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,941
Your house,
your home and sons...

1289
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:56,141
...when saving a marriage
sacrifices doesn't matter!

1290
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,445
There must be sense!

1291
01:35:58,552 --> 01:35:59,610
You start.

1292
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,778
l accept...

1293
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:03,618
l accept our relationship
wasn't going well.

1294
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:06,955
But there are two in a
relationship...

1295
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:10,963
...the way we live,
work and pressures.

1296
01:36:11,065 --> 01:36:15,695
l want to try it again.
l want our marriage back.

1297
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:17,697
lt won't work!

1298
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:19,471
You left me alone.

1299
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:22,303
You haven't thought
about me for a long time!

1300
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,502
You haven't made me feel
like a woman!

1301
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,375
l had to masturbate...

1302
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:30,482
- ...to feel alive!
- That's what you're looking for...

1303
01:36:30,584 --> 01:36:32,814
...an excuse to end up
our relationship!

1304
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,979
You don't care.
You don't care.

1305
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,649
This is very weird.
This is very weird.

1306
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:40,625
Why didn't you say goodbye
to your son...

1307
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:42,457
...when he went to Merida?
Tell me.

1308
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:44,997
What were you doing
out of your house...

1309
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:46,327
...all day long?
Tell me!

1310
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:49,334
l already talked to her!
We aren't talking about that.

1311
01:36:49,436 --> 01:36:53,736
l want to leave this house.
l don't want to be here!

1312
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:58,339
Besides, l want to forget you.
l really want to forget you.

1313
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:00,743
- l want time to find a house!
- Niurka!

1314
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,908
On Christmas you can be
with Emilio...

1315
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:06,348
...because l'm going
to be with them.

1316
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,588
l've already planned
my vacations.

1317
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:09,756
Niurka!

1318
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,752
This is over!

1319
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:24,367
ls something wrong, boss?

1320
01:37:25,272 --> 01:37:27,103
There are many things wrong.

1321
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,232
Boss...

1322
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:31,574
l'm destroyed...

1323
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:34,911
...lonely...

1324
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,110
...l feel very bad.

1325
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:40,913
All my worid...

1326
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:45,717
All my worid fall apart.

1327
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:49,856
l don't know if l'm going
to overcome this.

1328
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:53,860
Juan, you can't fall apart.

1329
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:58,702
There are lots of people who
depend on you and love you.

1330
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,534
lf you fell we all fell.

1331
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:04,903
lf you fell l'll do it
too, bastard!

1332
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:06,737
What do you want me to do?

1333
01:38:06,847 --> 01:38:09,873
What do you want me to do
if suddenly l lost everything.

1334
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:13,345
Everything!

1335
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:15,950
...my wife...

1336
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:17,555
...my sons.

1337
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:19,917
The three of them were
like my sons!

1338
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:23,153
l'm going crazy.

1339
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:24,397
l think that...

1340
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:29,232
...if my life depends on
another person to be plenty...

1341
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:33,034
...my life is fucked.

1342
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,836
There are lots of people
who want to see you down...

1343
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:37,136
...don't let them.

1344
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:39,807
You won't fell.

1345
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:42,277
Look at my eyes.
Repeat: l won't fell.

1346
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:45,978
- l won't fell!
- No, no! My father died!

1347
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:49,784
My father died.

1348
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:54,657
Who will hug me?
Who will advise me?

1349
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:58,229
You don't know how difficult
it was to try to talk...

1350
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:02,001
...to the woman l thought
was my wife!

1351
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:06,434
What about the love?
Try to rescue our marriage!

1352
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,509
And you know what...

1353
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,244
...you know that
everything was fake.

1354
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:13,446
Everything.

1355
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:20,953
Do you want to be my father?

1356
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:22,387
Say yes.

1357
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:29,596
Look.

1358
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,827
l'm your father.

1359
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:09,703
My son...

1360
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:17,569
You're the oldest. You
have to understand me.

1361
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:20,875
This is the first Christmas
without your father...

1362
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:22,506
...l can't resist it.

1363
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:24,344
Don't worry.

1364
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:26,544
l love you so much, mom.

1365
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:29,315
- My son...
- l love you.

1366
01:40:35,429 --> 01:40:36,396
l...

1367
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:41,030
...explain them.

1368
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,632
Well...

1369
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:50,300
...this night is going to
be sad since my dad isn't here.

1370
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:55,809
We have to try.

1371
01:40:56,016 --> 01:40:58,883
He wouldn't like
to see us sad.

1372
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:01,350
- You're right.
- l'll bring Emilio.

1373
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:03,990
- Okay.
- Can you give me my suit?

1374
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:42,453
<i>Juan, you're filming
the last chapters...</i>

1375
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,291
...of ''Velo de novia''
in Veracruz.

1376
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:46,965
Yes, you're right.
Here it is where it started...

1377
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,725
...Veracruz has given us a lot.

1378
01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:50,527
Here it is going to end.

1379
01:41:50,737 --> 01:41:52,637
Of course, not
the way l wanted.

1380
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:55,400
And the gossips about
your breaking up with Niurka...

1381
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,167
...because she has
another man?

1382
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:01,838
Honey, our room is ready.

1383
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:03,083
Thank you.

1384
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:08,785
Let's go because l'm
getting horny, you know.

1385
