1
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:29,717
What?

2
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,725
I keep thinking about Hawaii, right now.

3
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,091
My heart's in Hawaii.

4
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,364
How the hell can your heart be in Hawaii
when you've never been there?

5
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:42,100
You mean there's no place
you'd rather be than here?

6
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:46,037
I'm just saying I don't know
how you can think about Hawaii right now.

7
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:50,143
If I was in Hawaii right now,
I wouldn't think about being here.

8
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,184
See the difference?

9
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:53,142
No.

10
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:57,051
I'm not in Hawaii. I'm here, right?

11
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:59,751
I don't want to be here.
I want to be in Hawaii.

12
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,726
But I can't be in Hawaii.

13
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:05,955
Therefore, I think about it so as not
to get depressed about being here.

14
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,361
But I'm here.

15
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:10,633
Right.

16
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,002
- I don't want to be here.
- Right.

17
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:16,634
But I can't be anyplace else,
'cause all I see is this shit.

18
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:20,201
Now, how do you get around that?
That's what I'm asking you.

19
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:22,874
Focus.

20
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,111
"Focus."

21
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,721
It's time.

22
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:34,717
No more Hawaii. Focus on this.

23
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:41,830
Yeah?

24
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,871
- Aloha.
- Aloha my ass, Divinci.

25
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,240
Left at the corner.

26
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:30,605
What's up?

27
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,718
Hope you don't mind
me checking for weapons.

28
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,014
- Yeah. I do mind.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,023
What the fuck do I want
a man's hands on my body for?

30
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,153
Hold it.

31
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,593
Okay, check him.

32
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,332
Check good.

33
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,632
There's a lot of good hiding spots
on this body.

34
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,573
- Watch out. That's the loot.
- He's got nothin'.

35
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,702
So, what you got?

36
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:18,821
Not bad at all.

37
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,190
Any more where this came from?

38
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,528
Maybe.

39
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,196
Then maybe we talk again.

40
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,598
Maybe.

41
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,677
Yeah.

42
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:38,547
Told you there was
a lot of good hiding places on this body.

43
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,317
Bet you got a lot of good hiding spots
on that body, too.

44
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,692
Come on, man, hurry up!

45
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,022
Let's go! Let's go!

46
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,557
Joe.

47
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:32,687
Wake up.

48
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,163
Get out of the street
before you get run over.

49
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,669
Other way, Joe.

50
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,480
Forget it.
I don't think you'd feel it anyway.

51
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,231
- What the fuck?
- Keeping some late hours?

52
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,998
Come on, man! What the fuck
are my neighbors gonna think?

53
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:17,599
I apologize. I understand your concerns.

54
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,907
You must also understand that,
unlike a bank...

55
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:25,615
...I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient
encouragement to repay one's debts.

56
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:30,314
Therefore, I am forced
to hire the likes of Mr. Cutlass Supreme...

57
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,848
...whom, I might add,
contributes significantly to my overhead.

58
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:37,585
I'm the real loser here,
and I'm concerned about your sincerity...

59
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:42,192
...in repaying the $27,942 gambling debt...

60
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,202
...that is one week past due.

61
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,498
What can you do
to reassure me of your good intentions?

62
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,508
I can make your life fucking miserable,
that's what I can do.

63
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:53,009
Look at me.

64
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,838
Do I have a wife and three kids?

65
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,816
Do I have a good job at IBM?
Am I a handsome guy?

66
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,352
No, no and no.

67
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:03,488
I loan money at excessively
high interest rates...

68
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:06,616
...to pricks like you
who can't control their urge...

69
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,217
...to lose big money playing cards.
Then I have to stay up all night...

70
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,787
...trying to convince them
that I have needs, too.

71
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:17,064
The point of which is,
I already have a fucking miserable life...

72
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:21,132
...so don't threaten me,
you lousy bag of cat shit.

73
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,674
You fuckin'...

74
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:29,276
All I'm asking is that you be responsible.

75
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,780
Is that unreasonable?

76
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,448
That's $4,000.

77
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:42,856
That's all I got.

78
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,058
I'm proportionally reassured.

79
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,957
You purchased yourself an extension.

80
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:05,908
Another day, another body.
Where do you want to start?

81
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,986
- A hit?
- Yeah. It looks like it.

82
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,421
Could be gang related.

83
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:15,760
Happened some time last night.
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

84
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,261
Got an African-American male.

85
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,427
Looks like he's in his 30s,
but even that's a guess.

86
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,437
Half his head is on the upholstery.

87
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,167
- Got any witnesses?
- Sure. Hundreds.

88
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,916
Fucking animals!

89
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,778
- Shotgun shells, 12-gauge.
- Three shotgun shells, 12-gauge.

90
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:45,516
Hey, Divinci. Heard you got
a gang related, you lucky guy.

91
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:49,651
- Yeah, one less drugstore on the street.
- The world's a safer place.

92
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,590
- Thanks.
- No problem.

93
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,826
Brown?

94
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,195
Blond?

95
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,467
Blond like Mel Gibson?

96
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,038
Want to go for a ride?

97
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,240
Why, did you get it?

98
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:42,178
As of last night, partner,
I have enough to make the down.

99
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:46,784
Picture me under some swaying palms,
sipping on a mai tai.

100
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:50,344
You got primary on the drug related
this morning on 27th?

101
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,418
We're working on it right now.

102
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:55,086
- Who's your second?
- Rodriguez.

103
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:58,324
- In my office, both of you.
- Why?

104
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,893
Now.

105
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,262
Let me finish this.

106
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,669
No, no, no. Come on. Come on!

107
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,877
Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez...

108
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,675
...this is Richard Simms.
He's with the DEA.

109
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,808
He wants to ask you some
questions about your case.

110
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,450
- What's the occasion?
- You get an ID on the victim?

111
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:25,350
- Still waiting on the prints.
- Car was registered to...

112
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,985
Anchor Imports. '81 El Dorado, black.

113
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:36,028
- Lf you got this, what do you want with us?
- The man in the car was Lionel Hudd.

114
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:39,329
How does he know that?
What the hell's going on here, Captain?

115
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,236
Hudd was DEA, undercover.

116
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:46,070
He was working a case
on syndicate distribution of narcotics...

117
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,841
...but every dealer we tagged
kept getting killed.

118
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:51,380
We finally got a lead on a girl.

119
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:59,484
Hudd was a friend of mine, and I'm gonna
nail the son of a bitch who killed him.

120
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:10,796
Look...

121
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:13,964
...we're gonna do
everything we can to help you.

122
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:20,241
- A cop's a cop, right?
- That's right.

123
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:33,416
Shit!

124
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,289
- Fucking dumb fuck. What a dumb fuck!
- All right, just calm down.

125
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,161
Why didn't you fucking frisk him?

126
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,327
- Calm down for a second.
- You didn't think to fuckin' search him?

127
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:44,664
Just calm down! You hear me?

128
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,672
- You killed a fucking cop!
- Calm the fuck down!

129
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,903
Calm the fuck down!
Goddamn son of a bitch!

130
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,877
Get your fucking hands off me, fucker.

131
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:56,210
You just calm the fuck down!
You understand me?

132
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:58,317
You fucking understand me?

133
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:04,723
I want you to shut up
and fucking listen to me for a second.

134
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:08,287
They could be watching us right now,
you asshole.

135
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:10,893
Let me go.

136
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,765
Get in the fucking car.

137
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,849
Now look,
there's no fucking reason to panic.

138
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,147
No fucking reason to panic?
This ain't no fucking reason to panic?

139
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,586
Stop being an idiot. All right?

140
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,984
We're the cops on this case.
This is our case.

141
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:42,494
- We're gonna find the fucking killer.
- We are the fucking killers!

142
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,829
Since when does that matter?

143
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,515
All they want is someone to go down
for the crime. Right?

144
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,415
Do we care who goes down for the crime?
Fuck, no.

145
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,817
As long as someone goes down
for the crime.

146
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,288
It's a slot that's gotta be filled.

147
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,226
"Slot to be filled."

148
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,529
Frank, we killed a fucking cop.

149
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,191
- That doesn't bother you?
- Of course it bothers me.

150
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:24,066
What the hell you want me to do?
Turn myself in? I'm not gonna do that.

151
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:26,331
Look, this is a risk we take
every goddamn day.

152
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:29,306
Somebody might pop us,
especially undercover like that.

153
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,935
So somebody got popped.
He got popped. It happens.

154
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:33,907
"It happens." He's a fucking cop!

155
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,174
You don't get popped by cops
when you're a cop!

156
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:39,251
I patted him down.
He had no badge. He had no gun.

157
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:43,083
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
How was I supposed to fucking know?

158
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:45,646
You patted him down?
You couldn't feel a fucking wire?

159
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:49,388
No. He had no badge, nothing.
I'm telling you, he was a fucking idiot.

160
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,526
But we got to start thinking
about us here, man.

161
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:56,459
The important thing
is not to lose control of this case.

162
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:57,627
Yeah.

163
00:15:57,703 --> 00:16:01,036
Whatever evidence there is,
it's got to go through us.

164
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,234
We lay down a trail,
we make it nice and logical.

165
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:09,238
We're the teachers and two and two
can add up to five if it's our classroom.

166
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,175
So what are you saying?

167
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:16,483
- You're saying we stick this to somebody?
- Yeah.

168
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:19,490
Evidence points to wherever
the fuck we want it to point.

169
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:20,820
Too fucking weird.

170
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,985
We can provide so much fucking evidence...

171
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:26,725
...that even the asshole we pick
will think he fucking killed him.

172
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,860
- So you got an asshole in mind?
- Don't worry.

173
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:34,269
"Don't worry."

174
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,639
We'll find a killer.
There's lots of them out there.

175
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,910
Come on.

176
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:32,156
What the fuck did I do now?

177
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,233
What the fuck is all this for?

178
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:48,811
Do we look like fucking track stars to you?
We're here to fucking run?

179
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,023
- Yo, man, that ain't my gun.
- Never is, is it?

180
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,188
- It ain't my fucking gun.
- It's got your fucking prints.

181
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:08,028
Know somethin'?
You know what? Whatever.

182
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,660
Where were you last Friday night?

183
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:14,199
Friday night?

184
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,173
- Last Friday night?
- Come on, am I fucking talking to myself?

185
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:20,575
Where were you last Friday night?

186
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,441
Whatever the hell I was supposed to
have done happened last Friday night?

187
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,042
You better have a good alibi, James,
or it's good ali-bye-bye.

188
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,287
I was in jail all night. Check it out.

189
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,296
Y'all ain't got nothin' on me!
So y'all can just let me go right now.

190
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,857
What's up?

191
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,494
Freeze! Police!

192
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,263
Shut the fuck up!

193
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,805
Get down!
Get on the fucking ground right now!

194
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,932
Down on the fucking ground!

195
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,906
- Shut the fuck up!
- Here, take them!

196
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,445
God damn it! My fucking shoulder!

197
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,539
That's the last motherfucking time
I open the goddamn door!

198
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:03,076
Ain't my gun.

199
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,680
That's funny,
it's got your fingerprints on it.

200
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,117
- Fuck! I never seen that gun...
- Get the fuck down!

201
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,092
Where were you Friday night?

202
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,365
Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer.

203
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,632
A lawyer? What are you, stupid?

204
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:24,767
You think a hotshot lawyer will
come in here and save your ass? Hell, no.

205
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,777
All the evidence we have
points to you, Cortez.

206
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,577
Did you say last Friday night?

207
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,443
Yeah, that's right.

208
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:39,723
Intensive care,
you <i>pendej</i>o fucking gutter shits.

209
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:44,627
And Thursday night and Saturday, too.
I just fucking got out this morning.

210
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,365
Shit! All right, all right, all right.

211
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:54,270
- I ain't gonna fight you.
- I know you're not gonna fucking fight.

212
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,173
Ain't my gun.

213
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,274
- That's what they all say.
- I wish it was.

214
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,246
No better gun than a Smitty & Wes,
.44 mag.

215
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,625
With the serial numbers filed off.

216
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,853
Got any bullets?

217
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,397
- Who did I kill?
- Where were you last Friday night?

218
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,064
- You mean, what's my alibi, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:32,101
I was breaking and entering.

220
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:36,648
Jewelry store on Seventh and Front
about 9:00.

221
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:41,712
Not even close to your jurisdiction.
And I got the rocks to prove it.

222
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:45,888
Sorry I can't help you guys...

223
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,820
...but one to five is way better
than 10 to life.

224
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:52,030
You know what I'm saying?

225
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,557
Look, this is our case,
not the goddamn DEA's.

226
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,432
It's been three days.

227
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:02,135
Look, we're not fucking magicians here.
It's only three days.

228
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:05,074
This is a big goddamn murder case.
We need a little time.

229
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,003
When a federal undercover officer
goes down...

230
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,978
...it's never a fucking murder case.

231
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,644
Look, I don't like the DEA on my ass
any more than you like them on yours...

232
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:16,517
...but this is personal for them,
and they want answers.

233
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:20,886
Forget your other cases and get me
something, anything I can give to them.

234
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:23,928
The last thing I want
is the goddamn FBI on my back, too.

235
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:26,863
All right, we got a few leads.
We'll follow up.

236
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:28,999
I can't hold them off much longer.

237
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,134
This is bullshit.

238
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,836
And you both know it. No disrespect...

239
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,375
...but this is no way to run
a fucking investigation!

240
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:38,569
Easy.

241
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,336
Let me tell you both something.

242
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,506
If you don't solve this quick,
they're gonna start asking why.

243
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,413
And they'll want to blame
somebody in this department.

244
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:52,480
Get something fuckin' fast, or turn over
what you've got and get out of the way.

245
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,725
That's it, baby!

246
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,837
I think this is breaking and entering,
isn't it?

247
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,737
I work homicide. I don't work that shit.

248
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:47,072
Did you learn anything
you didn't already know?

249
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:50,204
Yeah. You surprise me sometimes.

250
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:54,445
I think you're just a hard case,
and I discover you got a heart of gold.

251
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,919
Organ donor?

252
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,249
That's really nice.

253
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:04,529
- Too bad they'll never use your best parts.
- I'll make sure you get them.

254
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,530
Thank you. I appreciate that.

255
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,398
I just think it's real nice, that's all.

256
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:15,902
I'm surprised we got
something in common besides...

257
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,706
...what we got in common.

258
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,847
What's so interesting out there?

259
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,413
I'm just thinking, that's all.

260
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:32,222
About us?

261
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,217
No.

262
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,289
Good.

263
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,535
What if I was thinking about us?

264
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,575
- Don't waste your time.
- What if I was?

265
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,738
- Where's it gonna get us?
- Maybe I got plans.

266
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,407
Yeah, I don't want to hear them.

267
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:01,482
Plans just make you think
that something's gonna get better.

268
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:06,518
I'm fine. I don't need to get screwed up
waiting for something good to happen.

269
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,856
I want you to know
that love is important to me.

270
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,230
- Me, too.
- But more important is Ioyalty...

271
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:19,134
...'cause Ioyalty is about respect.

272
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,172
And I'm Ioyal to you...

273
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,104
...like I am Ioyal to my partner.

274
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:31,040
We are closer than blood,
and I trust him with my life.

275
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,282
Why are you telling me?

276
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,354
'Cause when you asked me if I was
thinking about us and I said I wasn't...

277
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:42,389
...I want you to know...

278
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,217
...I do.

279
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,237
God damn it!

280
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,170
Fucking idiot!

281
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,607
Get out of here.

282
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:11,615
Asshole.

283
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,269
What do we have here?

284
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:42,446
Where were you last Friday night?

285
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:45,747
What's your name?

286
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,219
Your name. Your name.

287
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:52,524
What's your name?

288
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,967
Joe.

289
00:25:58,237 --> 00:25:59,363
Joe.

290
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,800
Where'd you get the gun, Joe?

291
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,945
It was in your pocket, your coat pocket.

292
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,650
Must carry it for protection, Joe?

293
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:16,677
I don't know.

294
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,481
Sure you do, Joe.

295
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,484
Everybody needs protection.

296
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,360
Especially a guy like you
who lives on the street.

297
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,027
Go ahead and put it away, Joe.

298
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:33,498
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

299
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,637
Put it in your pocket.

300
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:40,133
Wake up.

301
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,346
Joe, wake up.
You might wanna look at something.

302
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:46,950
Out the window, Joe.

303
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:51,155
Come on. Look out the window.

304
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,391
This is where it happened, Joe.
You remember?

305
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:59,190
This is where you killed him. Right here.

306
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,896
Look, look, Joe.

307
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,899
This is where you did it.
Do you remember?

308
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,836
Remember how you pulled
the gun out and shot him in the head?

309
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,270
I don't.

310
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:12,770
You will.

311
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,890
Come on, Joe. Time to get up.

312
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:36,296
Time to get up, Joe.

313
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,794
Come on. Get those photographs.

314
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,836
Get up, Joe.

315
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,667
Shit, this fucker smells.

316
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:50,580
I want you to look at something here.
There's the guy. There's the car.

317
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,080
Joe!

318
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:56,887
Tell me how you shot him.

319
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:02,024
Come on, Joe. Bring that booze over here.

320
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:05,528
Remember,
and I'll give you something to drink.

321
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,095
Joe?

322
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,931
You've got to remember
how you saw him driving towards you...

323
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,037
...and you were in the street...

324
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,539
...and you were afraid
that he was gonna hit you...

325
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,370
...so you shot him...

326
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,274
...to protect yourself, Joe, Right?

327
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,846
You remember now, don't you, Joe?

328
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:27,751
The gun, Joe?

329
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,781
Where do you keep the gun, Joe?

330
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,417
Where do you keep the gun, Joe?

331
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:47,563
There you go, Joe.

332
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:02,680
I know it's tough to remember things
you don't want to remember, Joe.

333
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:04,550
Okay, Joe.

334
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,382
Now, tell me...

335
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:10,051
...what happened?

336
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,795
How did it happen, Joe?

337
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:20,898
- You saw him driving towards you.
- Saw him driving towards me.

338
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,438
<i>-Y</i>o<i>u were In the street. </i>
<i>-I was In the street. </i>

339
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:54,696
Then what did you do?

340
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,545
You ran.

341
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:08,748

<i>I dldn't mean t</i>o.

343
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:16,452
He was gonna hit me. I was really scared.

344
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,195
- That's why you shot him.
- That's why I shot him.

345
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:23,765
- I didn't mean to.
- It's all right, you gotta protect yourself.

346
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:25,598
I was really scared.

347
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,602
That's why I...

348
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:33,736
<i>Y</i>o<i>u sh</i>o<i>t hlm. </i>

349
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,049
Hell of a shot, Joe.

350
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:55,695
You're doing
the right thing for yourself, Joe.

351
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:57,857
- You got it?
- Yep.

352
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:59,028
All right.

353
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:09,979
Hey, baby.

354
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,650
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the day.

355
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:14,116
Just talk.

356
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:16,053
Since when?

357
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,758
I need you to do something.

358
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:26,296
Good. I need the money.

359
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:29,424
No, it's not one of those deals.
Something else altogether.

360
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:32,536
- Where you going?
- I got perishables, baby.

361
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,772
Know the guy we did the deal with
the other night? He's dead.

362
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:40,403
- What?
- Yeah. Somebody popped him that night.

363
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:43,306
Probably when he was unloading the stuff.
I don't know.

364
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:47,374
- Look, does anybody think that...
- Don't worry about that.

365
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,186
They can't connect us.
Besides, we got the guy who did it.

366
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,684
You scared the hell out of me.

367
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:58,629
- But I need you to do one thing for me.
- Yeah, what?

368
00:31:58,863 --> 00:31:59,989
It's simple.

369
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:05,062
He'll be second from the left.
Don't fuck up.

370
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:07,764
- Second from the left.
- And what am I supposed to say?

371
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,501
You look at them,
and then you look at the man...

372
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,008
...and you say, "It's him."

373
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:15,811
- And I ask you if you're sure.
- And you say, "Absolutely. No question."

374
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,074
And this is all I have to do?

375
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,980
He confessed.
You ID him, he's going straight to the can.

376
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:22,349
Okay, but this is it.
I'm not doing anything more.

377
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,787
It's a done deal.
Will you quit complaining? Come on.

378

Now, take your time.

384
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:45,836
Try to remember his face.

385
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:49,479
I know him.

386
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:53,511
If you can identify the man...

387
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:56,049
- No, I know him.
- Choose him for us.

388
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,988
- No, I fucking know him.
- What's the problem?

389
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,581
Do you see him up there?

390
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,358
You don't understand.

391
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,323
Just pick the asshole out.

00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,100

Number two, Jimmy.

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,719
What the hell was that about?

397
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,784
I know him!
He hangs around my building in the alley.

398
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:40,388
People who hang around your
neighborhood aren't capable of killing?

399
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,296
You don't live in a great neighborhood!

400
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,200
- Sign the goddamn paper.
- What paper?

401
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,197
When you pick a guy out of a lineup,
you gotta sign a paper that says so...

402
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:50,969
...or they'll think we made the shit up.

403
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:54,205
Yeah? Why would they think
something like that?

404
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:55,745
Just sign it.

405
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,481
I thought you said
all I had to do was pick him out.

406
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,145
This is just part of it.
You sign it, and you're finished.

407
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:06,248
- How come you're so sure he did it?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

408
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,417
- He confessed.
- Bullshit!

409
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,519
- Lady, we got the confession on paper.
- He didn't do it!

410
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:15,760
Yeah? How the hell you know that?
Were you with him at the time?

411
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,730
Are you gonna be his goddamn alibi?

412
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,270
- She was probably blowing him.
- Better him than you.

413
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,863
- I can't afford you.
- Shut the fuck up!

414
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:27,201
Now, look...

415
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:29,780
This is what they call
an open-and-shut case.

416
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,840
He did the kill,
and he's going fuckin' down!

417
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:38,947
Don't make the mistake of thinking
you know the right fucking thing to do.

418
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,355
Now just sign the goddamn thing!

419
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:47,360
Fuck.

420
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,662
Bring him down here.

421
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,506
Warden.

422
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:00,134
Damn, man, you smell him?

423
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,335
"Doe"?

424
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:34,235
He wouldn't give us his last name.

425
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:38,804
He signed a confession,
but he wouldn't give you his last name?

426
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:43,513
He couldn't remember it.
What can I say? The guy's a head case.

427
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:48,091
- You run the prints?
- Yeah. No priors.

428
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,987
Ballistics match?

429
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:53,527
You know, you guys are funny.

430
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:58,026
A.44 was used in commission.
We found a fucking.44 on him.

431
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:01,366
It doesn't take a rocket scientist here,
guys. He did it.

432
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:04,670
- Went down pretty quick.
- It's our street.

433
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,836
- I think they did a hell of a job.
- God damn it!

434
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,811
Some goddamn piece of shit
blows him away for nothing!

435
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:13,851
Fuck.

436
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:22,023
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:28,591
Hudd was too good for this to happen.
I just didn't think he'd go down this way.

438
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,490
It was good work.

439
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:32,030
Thanks.

440
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:33,563
Sorry.

441
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:36,164
I appreciate it.

442
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,115
Do me a favor. Make sure this one sticks.

443
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,516
I don't want these DEA assholes
back in here.

444
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,379
Word is he killed a DEA undercover.

445
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,825
Word is he signed a confession.

446
00:36:55,894 --> 00:37:00,058
Word is everyone's entitled to a defense,
no matter how guilty they...

447
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:03,859
Shit.

448
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:08,037
- Okay, Judy.
- He's detoxing.

449
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,336
I gave him something
to help him through it.

450
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,069
Can I talk to him?

451
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:25,245
Joe, can you hear me?

452
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:32,292
Joe, I'm Elliot Goff.

453
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:34,965
Hi. I'm your attorney.

454
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:38,328
Joe...

455
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,397
You understand what I'm saying to you?

456
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:43,467
Joe...

457
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:53,381
And it was just two hours later,
on that same Friday night...

458
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:55,052
...when the defendant, Clyde Dunner...

459
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,815
...entered the home
of George and Carol Beeman...

460
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:00,824
...a.44 caliber pistol in his hand.

461
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,094
He entered that house
with one thing in mind...

462
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:06,454
...to kill George and Carol.

463
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:09,866
Why? Because those were
the two people...

464
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:13,870
...he blamed for the breakup
of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

465
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,802
George and Carol were watching a movie.

466
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,641
They were sitting on their couch
watching television...

467
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,907
...when the defendant
entered the living room...

468
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:25,539
...and opened fire.

469
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,916
George was killed instantly, hit in the face,
and Carol died later...

470
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:31,853
...three bullet wounds to her chest.

471
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:36,958
And then the defendant,
in an effort to cover up his crime...

472
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:40,487
...doused them both with lighter fluid...

473
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:43,092
...and set the house on fire.

474
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:47,236
Carol was still alive.

475
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,574
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

476
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,010
...we will prove to you
beyond any reasonable doubt...

477
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:59,315
...that the defendant, Clyde David Dunner,
is guilty of two counts of murder...

478
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:01,151
...in the first degree.

479
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,779
The defense may now proceed.

480
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,821
- Jesus Christ!
- I don't know where.

481
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,260
- What's wrong?
- They can't find the murder weapon.

482
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,527
- What are you talking about?
- They can't find the goddamn gun!

483
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,966
- They lost it or something. Misplaced it.
- What?

484
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:22,097
I don't have a goddamn case
without the goddamn gun!

485
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:26,507
The fingerprints, the ballistics, everything.
I have to have the fucking gun.

486
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:31,045
That murdering piece of slime
is gonna go free without the.44.

487
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:33,311
How the fuck can they lose it?

488
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:38,083
Yes. Eden, I want to speak
to Capt. Henderson.

489
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,157
You used the Dunner gun?

490
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:43,386
- I can't believe it!
- This is not my fuck-up.

491
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:46,726
Why didn't you use the fucking gun
from the Kennedy murder?

492
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:50,029
Listen, our shooting was supposed to be
gang related and unsolved.

493
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:52,500
Only because we popped
a goddamn undercover cop...

494
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,800
...did we need to find
a fucking.44 for evidence.

495
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:58,308
Otherwise, we would've never needed it,
so don't point your finger at me.

496
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,402
All right, okay? All fuckin' right. Fine.

497
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:03,707
But you explain to me
how we got the same gun...

498
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:06,079
...for two murders
by two different fucking killers?

499
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,141
And it's supposed to be in police custody.

500
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,812
All right. Don't explain it.
It's their fuck-up.

501
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:12,788
They lost the goddamn evidence.

502
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:15,724
Ballistics are already complete
in the Dunner's case.

503
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,852
All we need is another gun.

504
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:23,267
All my merchandise is in top condition.
Untraceable.

505
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,165
We'll take the.44.

506
00:40:45,623 --> 00:40:47,853
Hi, Joe. I'm Elliot. We met the other...

507
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:50,519
You weren't in good shape.

508
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,564
You look better now. Have a seat.
We have to talk.

509
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,261
About what I did?

510
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,898
Yeah. Sit down.

511
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:04,536
Before we get started, I want to go over
a couple of things with you first.

512
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:09,374
Now, Joe is your first name.
I assume that's "Joseph."

513
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:11,815
Okay.

514
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:15,879
What about Doe?

515
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:19,957
Is that what you told the officers
your last name was?

516
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:21,689
I don't think so.

517
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,751
What did you tell them
your last name was?

518
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,090
I don't remember.

519
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:30,033
Is Doe your last name?

520
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,199
Do you know what your last name is?

521
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:39,075
I would tell you if I could remember.

522
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:42,544
Joe Smith? Joe Jones? Joe DiMaggio?

523
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,615
All right. Okay.

524
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:53,888
Do you have any family?

525
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,495
Do you have any friends?

526
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:01,731
I don't know.

527
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:04,794
Joe, you...

528
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,499
You don't know very much
about yourself, do you?

529
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:13,237
But you remember the night
you shot the man in the car?

530
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:19,373
Why?

531
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:23,850
Because I can.

532
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,056
I'm sorry, I'm not...

533
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:31,325
...much help.

534
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,698
When you approached
the suspect in his apartment...

535
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,863
...did you identify yourself
as a police officer?

536
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:42,906
Yes.

537
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:45,272
- And did the suspect respond?
- Yes, he did.

538
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:46,776
In what way?

539
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,436
He shot through the door.

540
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:54,984
He fired six times until his gun was empty.
Ladies and gentlemen...

541
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,612
...I would like to show you
the weapon that he used.

542
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,652
A Smith & Wesson.44 caliber revolver.

543
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,017
The same weapon...

544
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:06,359
...he used to viciously murder
George and Carol Beeman.

545
00:43:06,597 --> 00:43:09,623
I would like to enter it into court records
at this time.

546
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,295
Thank you. Bailiff?

547
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,234
Thank you, Mr. Divinci.

548
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:19,605
At this time, the prosecution
would like to recall Mr. Steven J. Allen.

549
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:22,205
Call Steven J. Allen.

550
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:32,950
Could you remind the court
as to what you do, please?

551
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:35,891
Sure. I'm a lab technician
for the police department.

552
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,555
One of my duties is to examine
weapons used in violent crimes.

553
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,895
I tested the defendant's revolver
and matched the bullets fired...

554
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:45,128
...to those removed
from the body of the deceased.

555
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:46,191
That ain't my gun!

556
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:49,037
I must remind the defendant
he is not to speak out.

557
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:51,301
- That ain't my gun!
- Order in the court!

558
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:53,742
That ain't my fucking gun!

559
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:04,780
They're trying to fucking frame me!
That ain't my fucking gun!

560
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:11,652
- We gotta put the right gun back.
- We can't put it back.

561
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:13,924
Without that gun, they won't convict Joe.

562
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:16,056
Without that, they'll let Clyde back out!

563
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:19,864
I don't give a fuck about Clyde!
I give a fuck about us right now!

564
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,367
Look, it's like you said.
He signed a confession, right?

565
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:24,931
It's an open-and-shut case.

566
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:27,210
I swear to God, Frank...

567
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:30,814
...if we let Clyde get back on the streets,
he's gonna kill again.

568
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:35,419
How'd that little piece of fuckin' puke
know that wasn't his damn gun?

569
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:36,986
Tell me that!

570
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:41,248
I don't think he knows his own mother,
but he knows his own fucking gun?

571
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:42,724
Bullshit!

572
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:45,958
I don't think that's important right now.

573
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:47,862
I know it's not important!

574
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:53,531
- Open up.
- Sorry, Divinci, can't do it.

575
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:56,232
What do you mean you can't?
I gotta check something.

576
00:44:56,307 --> 00:44:59,708
- You got written permission?
- Since fuckin' when?

577
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:03,405
Since an hour ago, when he ripped me
a new asshole big as a three-car garage.

578
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:04,606
Okay, what's the problem?

579
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:07,149
Something about missing evidence.
Who the hell knows?

580
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:10,244
All I know is
I want to transfer the hell out of here.

581
00:45:10,554 --> 00:45:13,022
- What are we supposed to do?
- How should I know?

582
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,856
Ask the fucking chief, all right?
Policy ain't my department.

583
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:20,821
Thanks a lot.

584
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:23,029
Whenever you're ready.

585
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:25,362
Yes, we would like to plead not guilty...

586
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,996
...to the charge of murder
for reason of insanity.

587
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:30,131
- But I did it.
- Let me handle this.

588
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,674
I signed the confession.

589
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:35,337
Don't worry, I'm the attorney.
All right? Let me handle it.

590
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:37,937
Your Honor, can we have
a moment, please?

591
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:40,307
Counsel may approach the bench.

592
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:48,384
My colleague's client
has admitted to the killing.

593
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:50,893
I don't see any reason
to go through a trial...

594
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,691
...when it is obvious that the man
would like to plead guilty.

595
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:54,958
I don't agree.

596
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:57,262
If he wants to plead guilty,
you have to let him.

597
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:59,768
- Not if he's not of sound mind.
- Come on, Elliot!

598
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:01,828
- I think he's crazy.
- Sure. Of course he is.

599
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,237
You think he's putting it on.

600
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:05,969
That's DA's standard procedure.
But I don't think he is.

601
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:07,704
So I'm standing by the not guilty...

602
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:10,178
...because I believe he's incapable
of sound judgment.

603
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:13,307
- Have you had a psychiatrist look at him?
- Yes, Your Honor.

604
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:17,649
I think you'll see that my diagnosis
is not without warrant.

605
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:24,454
I'll review the findings
and make my decision tomorrow.

606
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:27,222
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

607
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:32,829
Besides, I hear there's a good chance
of beating the charges for lack of evidence.

608
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:44,546
Nobody can connect us to the evidence.
We're clean there.

609
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:47,741
The most important one
is the DEA mess, anyway.

610
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:50,412
Once that's finished,
we're completely in the clear.

611
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,318
You know we can't do this anymore, Frank.

612
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,328
Yeah. I guess.

613
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,693
No. No fucking "I guess." That's it.

614
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,426
No more!

615
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:07,070
Good while it lasted, though.

616
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:10,039
$100,000 a piece for a few nights' work?

617
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,166
- That's not bad.
- You know, Frank...

618
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:16,802
...I think maybe what we did wasn't right.

619
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:19,648
- I mean...
- Come on, man.

620
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:21,909
Think about it.

621
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:26,451
Look, we took out a few scumbags.
That's it, right?

622
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,725
Nobody's ever gonna miss
those shitheads anyway.

623
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,154
They were all garbage.

624
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:33,321
None of them had a sheet
less than a mile long.

625
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:36,366
Drugs, extortion, assault.

626
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:39,992
They were all guilty and still on the street,
and you know that.

627
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:41,961
All except the cop.

628
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,198
Except the cop.

629
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,778
That's just part of the job.

630
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:51,110
It could have easily happened
to you or me.

631
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:54,082
But that's just fucking it.
We are fucking cops.

632
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:57,047
- We fucked up, man.
- We fucked up once.

633
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:58,554
Once out of 10.

634
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,988
Come on, that's not bad.

635
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:05,961
All right, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

636
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,828
The guy was in the wrong place
at the wrong fuckin' time.

637
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:12,363
What do you want me to say?
I'm not going down for it.

638
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:13,425
I know.

639
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:17,163
I mean, all I want in life
is a goddamn fishing boat...

640
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,732
...a couple of drinks, a beach
and some Hawaiian music.

641
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:24,109
That's not much to ask for 20 years putting
murdering assholes behind bars, is it?

642
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:30,920
It's just not fair. That's all I'm saying.

643
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:35,255
And for a while, we made it fair.

644
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:42,623
And quit thinking you're a bad guy.
You're not a fucking bad guy.

645
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,094
All right?

646
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:47,396
You made one mistake. Let it go.

647
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:51,341
- I guess you're right.
- Damn right, I'm right.

648
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:53,103
I just get worried, that's all.

649
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:54,701
Worry!

650
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:58,108
Worry. It's natural.
You should be worried a little bit.

651
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,479
Shit, if you didn't worry, I'd be worried.

652
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,946
Just don't ever lose your sense of humor.

653
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:07,120
"Sense of humor."

654
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:09,588
They're all garbage.

655
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:12,885
Nothing wrong
with taking out the garbage.

656
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:16,862
A lot of people don't know that.

657
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:21,436
The defendant will stand and face the jury.

658
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:23,699
What is your verdict?

659
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:27,369
We find the defendant, Clyde David Dunner,
not guilty.

660
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:29,703
Yes!

661
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:32,874
Fuckin' A, man.

662
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:35,308
Thank you! Thank you!

663
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:46,229
And you haven't seen him
any time since then?

664
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:47,860
All right.

665
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:51,300
- We gotta talk.
- Could you hold on one second, please?

666
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:53,962
Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked, right?

667
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:56,370
No. Joe's going to fucking trial.

668
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:00,339
Judge found him mentally unfit to plead.

669
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:03,847
His lawyer pleads
not guilty by reason of insanity.

670
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,742
- You're fuckin' kidding me.
- I love to make people laugh.

671
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,908
That's my life's work.

672
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:11,681
Did you hear the one about the two cops
who popped a DEA agent?

673
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,518
I'll call you right back.

674
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:17,482
Hello?

675
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:19,889
Divinci. It's Gardner.

676
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:21,897
Sorry to call you so late, but...

677
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,296
...I got a really stressed out woman here.

678
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:26,359
Said she needs to talk
to you about a murder.

679
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:30,567
I told her I couldn't call you at home,
but she insists that it's very important.

680
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:34,441
You know, it's the "life and death" thing.

681
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,706
What's her name?

682
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:41,209
All right. Tell her to wait.
I'll be right there. Shit.

683
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:45,312
- What the hell are you doing?
- I got to go down to the station.

684
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:48,084
Now? Jesus, what time is it?

685
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,225
Go back to sleep.

686
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:53,286
Frank, this is no way
to repair our marriage, you know?

687
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:54,854
Yeah, I know.

688
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:59,532
Approximate weight?

689
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:01,870
Color of hair?

690
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,336
Gardner, this her?

691
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:04,666
Yeah.

692
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,207
How do you do?

693
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,672
This way.

694
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:12,944
- Frank, this guy came...
- Not now.

695
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:18,821
I thought you said
all I had to do was pick him out...

696
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:20,151
...and that was all.

697
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:23,022
- What are you talking about?
- Look! They want me in court!

698
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:25,618
This is not what you promised, Frank.

699
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,091
I can't go to court. I can't do this, Frank.

700
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:32,067
I cannot go to court. I can't do this.
I'm getting out of here. I gotta go.

701
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,969
You're not getting out of here.
Get in. Shut up.

702
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,140
Fuck!

703
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:43,643
- I can't do this, Frank!
- Calm the fuck down!

704
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:46,682
- No! I told you I can't do this!
- I warned you about this!

705
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,584
Calm the fuck down for a second!
This was not supposed to happen!

706
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:53,020
Just calm down!
Let me think for a second!

707
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:56,290
Fine. Think. Think away.

708
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,828
Think away. All right.

709
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:02,423
Here. They want you to be a witness.
That's all, okay?

710
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:04,864
There's nothing to worry about.

711
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,402
You saw something happen.

712
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:09,695
What, Frank? What did I see?

713
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,841
I will tell you everything you gotta know.

714
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:15,106
Everything.

715
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:18,337
I will tell you exactly what to say.

716
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,179
Just like another stage.

717
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,082
It's like dancing.

718
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:25,722
Hi, Joe.

719
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:29,984
You look much better.

720
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:31,928
Jail has been good for me.

721
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:36,064
Trial date is set for Thursday.
I just wanted to go over...

722
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:40,763
I've been thinking about what I did,
and I don't think that it's right...

723
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:42,328
...that I should try getting off.

724
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,932
Excuse me?

725
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:45,668
I wanna plead guilty.

726
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:49,473
I killed a man. I should be punished.

727
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:52,706
I'm a little surprised.

728
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:54,149
Why?

729
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:58,580
Nobody ever wants to be punished
for what they've done.

730
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:02,022
That is a totally new concept for me,
believe me.

731
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,420
But listen, I still think
our defense is reasonable.

732
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:07,828
I don't believe,
under the condition you were in...

733
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:09,866
...that you were responsible
for your actions.

734
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:15,001
Then why was I carrying a gun?
I had no right to carry a gun.

735
00:53:15,072 --> 00:53:16,903
If you hadn't been, you might be dead.

736
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:19,068
And he might still be alive.

737
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,609
I underst...

738
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:23,145
Can I think about this, please?

739
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,747
No.

740
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:27,511
I've made up my mind.

741
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:32,744
Joe...

742
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:42,292
No, I didn't know him.

743
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:45,824
- I used to see him in the neighborhood.
- Where were you standing?

744
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:48,570
What if she takes off?

745
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:52,642
Then we got no goddamn witness
puts him at the scene.

746
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:56,040
Yeah, but what if she testifies
and nobody fuckin' believes her?

747
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:57,705
Perjury, maybe.

748
00:53:57,981 --> 00:53:59,414
That's a 50-50.

749
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:01,382
They might believe her.

750
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:03,851
She's a fucking stripper, for Christ's sake.

751
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:07,755
- Nobody's gonna believe her.
- Look, she's got... What the fuck?

752
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:10,251
I don't believe her when she tells the truth.

753
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:11,316
What?

754
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:12,828
- We got two bodies out here.
- So?

755
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:14,523
- Three more in the house.
- So?

756
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:17,829
I just wondered
if you're gonna be the primary on this.

757
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:20,665
Yeah, we're coming.
Just give us some room.

758
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:22,633
Come on!

759
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:26,599
Look, Frank,
she could blow this whole thing.

760
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:29,237
She could tie us in.
That would be it, we'd be fucked.

761
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:31,045
All right.

762
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:35,111
If it looks like she's gonna crumble,
we'll take steps.

763
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:36,510
What steps?

764
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:38,054
Steps.

765
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:40,923
One more chalk outline in the city,
more or less.

766
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:42,822
- Who's gonna notice?
- Shit, Frank.

767
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,191
Come on, man. You think I like this?

768
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:47,763
You know, you just can't go around
killing everybody.

769
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,160
Wait just a second.

770
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,726
Look around. What do we got?

771
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,306
We got two stiffs on the pavement,
shot to shit, three more inside.

772
00:54:57,374 --> 00:54:59,865
That's five chalk outlines in one day...

773
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:02,434
...in one deal, in one neighborhood,
in one city.

774
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:05,811
Just let me fill you in
on some fuckin' statistics here, okay?

775
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,907
We're not killing everybody!

776
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:15,624
Look, it's strictly last resort, all right?

777
00:55:17,394 --> 00:55:18,622
Let's not kid ourselves.

778
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:20,595
Push comes to shove,
somebody's going down.

779
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:23,656
If you got another candidate,
I'm willing to listen.

780
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:30,671
Come on. Let's do some work.

781
00:55:32,476 --> 00:55:34,944
- What?
- There's a body here.

782
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:36,309
He's dead.

783
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,138
- There's the other one.
- He's dead, too.

784
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,547
<i>In the last few weeks, </i>
<i>we've g</i>o<i>tten hundreds... </i>

785
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,991

786
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:53,659
- Hello?
- Cynthia Webb?

787
00:55:54,197 --> 00:55:56,893
This is Richard Stein
with the District Attorney's office.

788
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,603

790
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:07,065
Miss Webb?

791
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:08,767
Yeah.

792
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:10,908
Any chance we could get together today?

793
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:13,748
I'm really busy today.

794
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,418
It won't take long.
You gonna be home around 2:00?

795
00:56:20,457 --> 00:56:23,483
Yeah. 2:00 is fine.

796
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:57,726
Mr. McCall is on the terrace.

797
00:57:06,937 --> 00:57:08,598
Mr. Baylor is here.

798
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,804
- Arthur.
- Nathan, how are you?

799
00:57:12,876 --> 00:57:15,868
Good, Arthur. Thanks.
Would you like some coffee?

800
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:17,436
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

801
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:18,741
Thank you.

802
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:23,712
This is all a bit of a mystery.

803
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:26,949
You certainly got my attention
with your phone call.

804
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:28,513
What's this all about?

805
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,761
Is there something here
you want me to see?

806
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,199
My God.

807
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:00,884
Cynthia?

808
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:11,959
Shit!

809
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:16,035
God damn it.

810
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:23,869
- Divinci?
- Yeah.

811
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,313
- Richard Stein, DA's office.
- Stein! Sure, sure, DA's office, yeah.

812
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:29,215
Sorry about that. I didn't expect this.

813
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:32,221
- What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk with Cynthia Webb.

814
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:33,881
She's a witness in...

815
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:34,956
Wait.

816
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:38,552
- Aren't you and Rodriguez on this one?
- Yeah, yeah, we're on this case.

817
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:42,086
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Got to go over the details, you know?

818
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,099
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah.

819
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,930
- Is she in?
- No.

820
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:50,163
- Don't know where the hell she is.
- I was supposed to meet her at 2:00.

821
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,868
- Do you know her?
- What do you mean?

822
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:55,267
I just mean...

823
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:59,808
- What?
- She's not in, and you were inside.

824
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,511
The legal scenario.
She's a witness in a murder case, all right?

825
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,282
You know, they don't answer a knock,
and the door's open...

826
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,390
...it's been my experience...

827
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:11,857
You know, I wanted to make sure
there were no bodies lying around.

828
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:12,984
Sure.

829
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:16,530
- Don't tell on me.
- No, no, of course not.

830
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:18,123
Great, man. Good to see you.

831
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:22,365
Think I'll wait.
She might be stuck in traffic or something.

832
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:25,736
If she does show up,
you let me know, all right?

833
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:27,674
- Because I need to talk to her.
- Of course.

834
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:29,541
All right. I'll see you in court.

835
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:31,806
- Right.
- All right.

836
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,249
Yeah, it's open.

837
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:47,058
- Elliot Goff?
- Yeah?

838
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:50,290
- Arthur Baylor?
- Yes.

839
00:59:53,069 --> 00:59:56,300
Sorry. God, Arthur Baylor. Hello.

840
00:59:56,506 --> 01:00:01,273
- Would you like... You're here to see me?
- Yes.

841
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:14,217
William.

842
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:31,404
Yes.

843
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:37,603
I waited till 3:00, but she never showed.

844
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:41,444
So what are you telling me?
That she missed the appointment?

845
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:43,075
Forgot you were coming? What?

846
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:45,780
My guess? She split.

847
01:00:46,022 --> 01:00:48,616
She split? Our witness split?

848
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:53,619
Can't we keep our evidence and witnesses
from disappearing around here?

849
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:56,689
I mean, what do I have to do,
lock them in the trunk of my car?

850
01:00:56,766 --> 01:00:58,700
What the fuck is going on?

851
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:01,828
I want that bitch back here
and on the stand or in jail!

852
01:01:01,905 --> 01:01:03,702
I'll find her. All right?

853
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:07,170
- I'll find her.
- Great. Thanks.

854
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:22,386
Yeah.

855
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:25,022
So why do you think he'd go there?

856
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:28,923
- We need to talk.
- Just a second.

857
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,967
Not just a second. Now!

858
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:34,364
What do you want, Divinci?
Look, I got a witness took off.

859
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:37,235
I gotta get her back. I ain't got no time.

860
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:39,969
You're the police.
What you coming to me for?

861
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:44,776
Don't ask me the fucking questions here.
Your job is to find her.

862
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:49,547
- Where have I seen her before?
- She dances.

863
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:51,912
Yeah, right.

864
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:53,783
So why'd she leave?

865
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,518
What the fuck is with the questions?

866
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:59,119
Look, I heard what the fuck you said.
Now, you want me to find her?

867
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:03,154
You need to tell me why the fuck she left,
so I know where not to look, all right?

868
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:12,001
All right, she's supposed to testify.
She got scared.

869
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:14,009
She thinks somebody might try to kill her.

870
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,975
That's why I want you to find her.

871
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:20,574
Because if someone's trying to pop her,
I don't want anyone knowing where she is.

872
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,316
So how long I got?

873
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:25,616
- You got two days.
- Two fucking days, man?

874
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:27,588
Just find her, pus-head.

875
01:02:29,392 --> 01:02:30,984
Sure, Detective.

876
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:35,628
I always like to help out the fucking police
whenever possible.

877
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:52,907
Isn't that Arthur Baylor?

878
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:00,686
What the hell is he doing here?

879
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:02,991
Hear ye, hear ye, all rise.

880
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:07,027
Face the flag and recognize
the principles for which it stands.

881
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:10,832
Criminal Court, Department G,
is now in session.

882
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:13,728
The Honorable Howard W. Pine presiding.

883
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:16,494
Please be seated and come to order.

884
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:20,337
<i>The Pe</i>o<i>ple v. J</i>o<i>e D</i>o<i>e</i>...

885
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:25,245
...in case number C9524705.

886
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:26,804
Before we proceed...

887
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:30,716
...I must ask the defense if there's anything
this court should be made aware of.

888
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:33,756
Yes, Your Honor.
I have joined the defense...

889
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:36,291
...in the representation
of Mr. William Daine McCall...

890
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:38,953
...otherwise known
to this court as Joe Doe.

891
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:41,729
I represented the McCall family
for several years...

892
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:44,562
...before Mr. McCall
disappeared seven years ago.

893
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:46,166
It was assumed that he had died...

894
01:03:46,236 --> 01:03:49,899
...but since he has reappeared
under these tragic circumstances...

895
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:54,376
...I would ask the court for a continuance
to allow the defense to prepare...

896
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:57,035
...in the light of his real identity
now being known.

897
01:03:58,314 --> 01:03:59,212
How long do you need?

898
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:01,183
One week should be sufficient.

899
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:04,920
Any objection
to a week's continuance by the state?

900
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,122
I don't...

901
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:09,457
...believe so, your Honor.

902
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:11,788
Then I grant a one-week's continuance.

903
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:14,893
We'll start the proceedings
next Monday morning.

"William McCall shunned
the business world...

01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:48,126
"...and turned his life to medicine...

"Once again, he turned his back

"...performing organ transplants
for the poor."

919
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:04,175
This is who you picked?
This is who you fucking picked?

920
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,511
You picked a surgeon who performs
transplants on the poor in Africa?

921
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:10,085
He was living on the fucking streets!

922
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:13,121
How was I supposed to know
he's a goddamn doctor?

923
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:18,126
He's not a fucking doctor.
You picked a saint to pin a murder on!

924
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:20,553
God!

925
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:23,926
When we pick them, we sure do pick them.

926
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,601
Why didn't you get the Pope
and pin it on him?

927
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:29,862
Here: "Disappeared seven years ago
on September 19th...

"...is now the mystery
that the court will try to help unravel."

934
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:52,753
Shit.

935
01:05:57,233 --> 01:06:00,498
- Let's just think about it for a second.
- Yeah, let's.

936
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:04,966
What's the worst-case scenario?

937
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,409
What, are you joking me?

938
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:10,309
- No.
- Are you playing?

01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:13,405
What's worse than what we've done
that could still happen?

940
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:16,451
Or what's worse if this doesn't work out,
blows up in our face...

941
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:20,853
...we go to jail, sent to the electric chair,
then we die, then we go to fucking hell?

942

Worse than that?

943
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:26,392
Will you work with me here?

944
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,293
Excuse me, I'm having a bad morning.
Maybe you could excuse me.

945
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:31,765
Would you repeat the question?

946
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:34,159
All right, Doc walks.

947
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,665
There's nothing to connect us
to the evidence.

948
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:42,311
There's one person
who can connect us to him.

949
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:50,742
I don't even want
to argue about it anymore.

950
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:52,714
Let's just fucking kill her.

951
01:06:54,891 --> 01:06:56,051
Frank?

952
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,267
All right, let's do it.

953
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:09,667
We need to talk.

954
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:15,238
- Man, are you fucking with me?
- I'm not fucking with you.

955
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,872
- Are you fucking with me?
- Hold on. You don't know?

956
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:22,706
- Know what?
- This isn't good.

957
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:25,083
- What?
- You're a cop, and you don't even know.

958
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:27,085
Come on, knock it off. What?

959
01:07:27,724 --> 01:07:28,918
The cops got her.

960
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:32,654
Ain't that a bitch? You a cop,
and you got to come to me to find out?

961
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:35,363
This is a crazy fucking world
we're living in, man.

962
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:37,399
What fucking cops? What cops?

963
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,162
I don't know what cops!

964
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:41,635
All I know is my people
went to her sister's house...

965
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:43,934
...and she had already left.

966
01:07:44,107 --> 01:07:47,304
Her sister said cops took her.
I figured it was you.

967
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:50,670
Fuck!

968
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:52,505
Fuck!

969
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,884
- Shit.
- What an asshole!

970
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,744
You're a good judge of character.

971
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:01,183
Look, she's our goddamn witness...

972
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:04,784
...and if she's in custody,
somebody better fucking tell me!

973
01:08:05,628 --> 01:08:07,960
Try to get at me as soon as you can.
All right.

974
01:08:09,766 --> 01:08:11,859
Anything? Nothing.

975
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,868
Nobody knows nothing.

976
01:08:14,203 --> 01:08:18,139
DA doesn't know anything.
The DEA doesn't know shit from shinola.

977
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:21,272
If she's being held by the police,
we'd know.

978
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:22,538
Unless she said something.

979
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:25,604
No, she didn't say anything,
or we wouldn't be sitting here.

980
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:27,308
It was that piece of shit.

981
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:29,479
What, Manny?

982
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:43,555
Don't ever lie to me again.

983
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:45,726
Okay?

984
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:59,246

<i>... In case number 9524705.</i>

992
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:33,804
...when he pulled this gun
and fired at agent Hudd...

993
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:36,350
...killing him instantly.

994
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:39,521
Let the record show
that this is the weapon used in the crime:

995
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:42,523
A Smith & Wesson.44-caliber handgun.

996
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:48,058
All these.44s
are starting to look the same to me.

997
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:52,328
So when you arrested the defendant,
did he deny having killed Agent Hudd?

998
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,390
No.

999
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:57,670
Can you describe the defendant's condition
at the time of his arrest?

1000
01:09:58,107 --> 01:09:59,165
Yes.

1001
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:00,942
He was drunk.

1002
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:05,379
We could smell the booze on him,
but we drew blood, and he did not object.

1003
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:07,175
We have the blood test report showing...

1004
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:09,877
...that he had four times
the legal limit to drive.

1005
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:14,647
But you knew that this was the man
that you were looking for?

1006
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:16,885
- Yes, sir.
- Based on what?

1007
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,350
Based on his description.

1008
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:22,094
And who provided you
with that description?

1009
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:25,894
A Miss Cynthia...

1010
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:27,694
...something.

1011
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:29,795
I don't know. I'm not sure.

1012
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:32,840
I believe her name is Cynthia Webb.

1013
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:35,537
Cynthia Webb.

1014
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:40,844
At least...

1015
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:44,653
...based on the statement filed
the night she picked him out of the lineup.

1016
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,046
Now, is that name familiar to you?

1017
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,219
Yes, that's her.

1018
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:52,725
And where did you find Miss Webb?

1019
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:55,925
On the same street. Same area.

1020
01:10:56,866 --> 01:11:00,597
And she agreed
to pick the defendant out of the lineup?

1021
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:01,694
Yes.

1022
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,602
Were you aware that
Miss Webb disappeared...

1023
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:05,971
...after she was served with a subpoena?

1024
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:10,977
Yes. My partner and I...

1025
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:14,344
...tried to contact her about the case...

1026
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,583
...but we were unsuccessful
in our attempts.

1027
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:21,985
Thank you, Detective.
That's all the questions I have.

1028
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:26,754
I'm gonna tell you right now,
you did a great job.

1029
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,989
Don't come down on yourself.

1030
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:31,525
Here.

1031
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,433
To justice in all its forms.

1032
01:11:38,074 --> 01:11:40,065
We're not out of the woods yet, buddy.

1033
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:43,339
Without Miss Webb,
there's no place they can go.

1034
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:45,903
We still got the confession,
the gun, the ballistics...

1035
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:48,506
...and I don't care
about all this African doctor crap.

1036
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:50,711
The man is a fucking drunk.

1037
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,822
He's been a fucking drunk
for seven goddamn years.

1038
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:57,523
Let's have a drink for drunks.

1039
01:11:59,662 --> 01:12:00,993
To drunks.

1040
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:08,433
I just wish I knew where the fuck she was.

1041
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:10,130
So...

1042
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:13,197
...I think we'll have
to rely on his confession...

1043
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:17,173
...for a description of what happened,
because he's never gonna take the stand.

1044
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:18,645
DA's office.

1045
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:20,873
What?

1046
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:23,518
When?

1047
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:25,347
Where...

1048
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:32,694
- They found Cynthia Webb.
- What? Where?

1049
01:12:33,963 --> 01:12:35,726
- I don't know.
- When?

1050
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:37,992
- I don't know.
- Who the hell was that?

1051
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:41,059
I don't know, I don't know. They hung up.

1052
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:46,166
What the hell is going on around here?

1053
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,208
I don't know.

1054
01:12:52,314 --> 01:12:56,341
You don't need to say nothing,
but are you really a doctor?

1055
01:12:58,354 --> 01:12:59,514
I was.

1056
01:13:00,556 --> 01:13:03,218
- A surgeon.
- No shit!

1057
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,551
No shit! Really?

1058
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:07,695
A surgeon?

1059
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:12,460
I know I'm nobody to judge,
but you must've been a smart guy.

1060
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:15,927
What the hell are you doing in here?

1061
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:23,167
I had an affair with another woman.

1062
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:27,107
A nurse at the hospital that I worked at.

1063
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,847
It was...

1064
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,951
...something.

1065
01:13:34,323 --> 01:13:38,259
I don't remember much about her,
except that my wife found out about it.

1066
01:13:41,397 --> 01:13:42,921
We had a fight.

1067
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,561
She left the house, she took the kids.

1068
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,499
She was hysterical.

1069
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:55,836
I should've done something...

1070
01:13:57,213 --> 01:13:59,374
...gone after them, I don't know.

1071
01:14:07,757 --> 01:14:11,955
They died in a car accident
about a mile from the house.

1072
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:30,301
I never told anybody that.

1073
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:43,848
Your Honor, the people would like to call
Miss Cynthia Webb to the stand.

1074
01:14:43,926 --> 01:14:46,360
The court calls Cynthia Webb.

1075
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:03,711
Raise your right hand.

1076
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:06,009
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1077
01:15:06,115 --> 01:15:08,242
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1078
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,409
- Sure.
- I know her.

1079
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:14,114
- She's the woman who identified you.
- No, no, I mean, I know her.

1080
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:16,283
- How?
- I don't know.

1081
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:17,882
I think I lived near her.

1082
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,326
Could you please state your name
for the court?

1083
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:21,294
Cynthia Webb.

1084
01:15:21,363 --> 01:15:24,662
Do you recognize the man
that you identified in a police lineup?

1085
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,065
- Yes.
- Is he anywhere in this courtroom?

1086
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:30,062
Yes.

1087
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:33,238
Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?

1088
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:35,735
Yes.

1089
01:15:37,613 --> 01:15:42,107
Could you please describe for us
what you saw on the night of June 14?

1090
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:48,022
<i>I was c</i>o<i>mlng</i> o<i>ut</i> o<i>f thls</i>
<i>all-nlght mlnl-mart. </i>

1091
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:09,535
How sure are you...

1092
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:12,547
...that the man you saw with the gun
is the defendant?

1093
01:16:14,383 --> 01:16:15,611
I'm sure.

1094
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:18,350
Thank you.

1095
01:16:18,554 --> 01:16:20,351
No further questions.

1096
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:22,154
Miss Webb...

1097
01:16:23,259 --> 01:16:25,124
Is it "Miss"?

1098
01:16:25,628 --> 01:16:26,652
Yes.

1099
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:28,491
Miss Webb...

1100
01:16:28,564 --> 01:16:32,091
...had you ever seen the defendant
before that night you just described?

1101
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:33,458
No.

1102
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,603
Do you know what perjury is?

1103
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:44,679
- When you lie.
- When you lie under oath in a court of law.

1104
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:46,578
Do you know what the penalty for that is?

1105
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:49,082
- You go to jail.
- Yes.

1106
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:50,345
Cynthia...

1107
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,354
...did you ever see
the defendant before that night?

1108
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:56,357
Objection. The witness
answered that question, Your Honor.

1109
01:16:56,425 --> 01:16:57,414
Sustained.

1110
01:16:57,593 --> 01:17:01,461
I'm just trying to give the witness
the opportunity to remember...

1111
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,964
...if she ever saw Mr. McCall...

1112
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:06,761
...any other time before
the night in question.

1113
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:10,328
Miss Webb, do you
understand the consequences of perjury?

1114
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:13,970
- Yes.
- Let's get on with it then.

1115
01:17:16,145 --> 01:17:18,443
What did you buy
when you went into the mini-mart?

1116
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:22,781
- What did I buy?
- You remembered seeing Mr. McCall.

1117
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,978
You remembered a gunshot
and the car crash.

1118
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:28,250
I just wondered if you remembered
what you bought in the mini-mart.

1119
01:17:35,164 --> 01:17:37,962
- Shampoo, I think.
- That's all?

1120
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,362
- Yeah.
- Where do you live?

1121
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:44,139
435617th street, No. 4.

1122
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:46,003
Is that close to this mini-mart?

1123
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:48,339
Close? Sort of.

1124
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,570
How far would you say?

1125
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,278
- I don't really know.
- Is it walking distance?

1126
01:17:52,481 --> 01:17:55,143
- Not really.
- Did you walk there that night or drive?

1127
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:57,919
- I drove.
- You drove?

1128
01:17:57,987 --> 01:18:01,548
But when you left the mini-mart,
you said you walked along the street.

1129
01:18:01,623 --> 01:18:03,989
- Yes.
- How far?

1130
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,152
- To the corner.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1131
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,719
I don't see the point
to this line of reasoning.

1132
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:11,957
- Is there a point?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1133
01:18:12,034 --> 01:18:13,865
Since this is the only witness...

1134
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:17,329
...I'm just trying to establish
what the scene was like that night.

1135
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:20,898
- Try to get there as quickly as possible.
- Thank you, sir.

1136
01:18:21,377 --> 01:18:24,210
How far from the corner
was this mini-mart?

1137
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,448
I mean, was it in the middle of the block?

1138
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:28,044
Close to the corner?

1139
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:32,816
- In the middle, I think.
- So you walked all the way to the corner?

1140
01:18:32,888 --> 01:18:36,187
- I assume you were going back to your car?
- Yes.

1141
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,158
Any reason you parked so far away?

1142
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,293
There were a lot of cars
on the street that night.

1143
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:43,228
Any other people on the street?

1144
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:45,257
No.

1145
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,396
Lots of cars, no people.

1146
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,002
Any traffic?

1147
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:51,535
I don't really remember.

1148
01:18:51,707 --> 01:18:55,370
So you were the only person
who saw Joe on the street that night?

1149
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,445
I didn't see anybody else.

1150
01:18:58,747 --> 01:19:00,214
So you heard a gunshot.

1151
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:02,014
You heard a car crash.

1152
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:04,985
You saw Joe running past
with a gun in his hand.

1153
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:07,955
What did you do then?
Call the police, 911?

1154
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:09,956
I went home.

1155
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:12,316
You went home? Straight home?

1156
01:19:12,661 --> 01:19:13,821
Yes.

1157
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:19,123
So you're sure it was Joe
you saw that night?

1158
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:22,068
Yes.

1159
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:23,971
When you went home?

1160
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,228
Yes.

1161
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:27,932
When you went home, you saw Joe?

1162
01:19:30,946 --> 01:19:33,471
- No.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1163
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:35,982
The defense
is trying to confuse the witness.

1164
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:40,078
I'm not trying to confuse the witness.
The witness is trying to confuse this court.

1165
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,555
And I have witnesses
who will refute her testimony...

1166
01:19:42,624 --> 01:19:44,922
...who were on the corner
the night of the shooting...

1167
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:47,553
...who never saw Miss Webb,
who never heard a gunshot...

1168
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:48,994
...who never saw Joe running past.

1169
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:52,227
Now, Miss Webb saw Joe
outside of her building that night...

1170
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:55,065
...because he lives in the alley next door.
Isn't that true?

1171
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:59,471
- Objection!
- When I referred to the defendant as Joe...

1172
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:02,237
...you knew exactly who I was
talking about, didn't you?

1173
01:20:02,311 --> 01:20:05,508
Now, this trial is
<i>The Pe</i>o<i>ple v. WIIIlam McCall</i>...

1174
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:06,375
...not "Joe."

1175
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:09,242
The name Joe
has never been mentioned in this trial...

1176
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:11,581
...so how did you know
who I was talking about?

1177
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:13,353
Miss Webb?

1178
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:16,856
How do you know the defendant as Joe?

1179
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:29,861
He lived in the alley
next to my apartment building.

1180
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,408
Shit.

1181
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:46,544
Why did you lie to this court?

1182
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,712
I don't know.

1183
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,284
Are you afraid of somebody?

1184
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:58,158
- I don't know.
- Are you trying to protect somebody?

1185
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:01,461
I don't know.

1186
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:06,774
Answer the questions, Miss Webb,
or I'll be forced to cite you for contempt.

1187
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:27,689
- She didn't talk.
- Don't hold your breath.

1188
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:31,028
- Do you think she's gonna talk?
- I know she's gonna talk.

1189
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:32,828
We can make it look gang related.

1190
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:35,199
The problem is,
we're gonna need another gun.

1191
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:38,569
The problem is, she's in fucking jail.
That's the goddamn problem.

1192
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,664
Yeah.

1193
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:43,233
Since when is being in jail
ever a guarantee of a long life?

1194
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:45,641
Just get another gun.

1195
01:21:53,589 --> 01:21:55,819
Wake up, Manny. Get up.

1196
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:58,951
- I didn't do anything.
- Everything's fine, everything's fine.

1197
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:02,656
I just came to apologize,
but I need a little privacy here.

1198
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,500
Come on, come on, come on. Move!

1199
01:22:08,203 --> 01:22:09,670
I need a favor.

1200
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,672
I need you to bail somebody out of jail.

1201
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,401
Bail's $25,000.

1202
01:22:13,742 --> 01:22:17,109
- You gotta be kidding.
- Now, look, I want her out tonight.

1203
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:19,545
I do not want you to tell her who.

1204
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,982
- It's a surprise.
- So how am I supposed to pay for this?

1205
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:25,884
You know, they don't take
American Express.

1206
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:32,088
I know you know how to get rid of this.

1207
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:35,061
There's a lot more than $25,000 here.

1208
01:22:35,464 --> 01:22:38,831
You keep the change.
But I want her out in two hours.

1209
01:22:39,468 --> 01:22:42,995
Otherwise,
I'll come back and nail you for possession.

1210
01:22:46,475 --> 01:22:48,272
How'd you get to be such a prick?

1211
01:22:48,977 --> 01:22:49,966
DNA.

1212
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:53,738
Asshole. I got your DNA.

1213
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:27,575
Did you get the gun?

1214
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:29,841
Yeah, I got it.

1215
01:23:31,453 --> 01:23:34,422
What's with you? You all right?
Everything okay?

1216
01:23:35,424 --> 01:23:37,415
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

1217
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:39,687
- What? What?
- We're going to kill a witness...

1218
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:42,457
...who's in jail because
we killed a fucking DEA agent.

1219
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:45,056
This kind of shit troubles me.
I'm sorry, Frank.

1220
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:49,293
Take off the fucking dress
and get back in the game, will you?

1221
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:52,799
Shake it off. Come on.

1222
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:56,699
We got to do what we got to do. That's it.

1223
01:23:57,779 --> 01:23:58,837
Yeah.

1224
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:02,183
I know. We got to do what we got to do.

1225
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:03,751
That's right.

1226
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:05,953
Let's just get it over with.

1227
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:10,682
I don't understand.
Why can't you tell me who bailed me out?

1228
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,455
The man comes to me
and tells me to bail you out.

1229
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:16,456
He gives me cash, I do it.
It's what I do for a living.

1230
01:24:16,531 --> 01:24:19,557
I bail people out of jail, all right?
You stay with me.

1231
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:21,458
Was he a cop?

1232
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,802
Right. Cops bail people out all the time.

1233
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:26,670
Ain't there some kind of dichotomy
in that shit for you?

1234
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:27,902
I don't like this.

1235
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:31,412
Look, you can either stay here in jail,
or you can come with me.

1236
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,849
- Shit, the choice is yours.
- Just tell me, what did he look like?

1237
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,589
You are a stripper, right?

1238
01:24:43,658 --> 01:24:45,956
Guys fall in love with your type
all the time...

1239
01:24:46,027 --> 01:24:48,621
...but they don't know how to get close.
You know?

1240
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:53,995
Baby, somebody wants you
to owe them something.

1241
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:56,994
You take that shit or leave it.

1242
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,236
Fuck!

1243
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:27,526
This is the last time, Frank.

1244
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:30,137
The last time we kill somebody.

1245
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:32,537
Yeah. It's the last time.

1246
01:25:33,308 --> 01:25:34,935
I mean...

1247
01:25:36,044 --> 01:25:37,534
...eleven is enough.

1248
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:40,205
Eleven dead bodies is enough.

1249
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:42,480
I get the picture.

1250
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:44,449
Damn, man.

1251
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:49,816
Why'd you have to go and kill Hudd?

1252
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:56,224
What's going on here?

1253
01:25:59,334 --> 01:26:01,928
What's the matter?
You mad at me or something?

1254
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:04,699
Why did we have to start
killing people, man?

1255
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,237
None of this shit would have
never happened if you...

1256
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:09,937
...hadn't started killing people.

1257
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:13,475
Look, drug dealers don't qualify as people.

1258
01:26:13,815 --> 01:26:15,282
Never did, never will.

1259
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:18,719
Now, what the hell's wrong with you?

1260
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:23,782
What's the matter? You're worried about
where the money went, is that it?

1261
01:26:25,193 --> 01:26:26,922
I'm just sick of it.

1262
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:28,954
Sick of it all.

1263
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:30,825
That's all.

1264
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:32,633
I'm all right.

1265
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:03,230
I need some fresh air.

1266
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:47,469
What's going on, man?

1267
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:52,604
Just talk to me, all right?

1268
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:55,449
Just fucking talk to me.

1269
01:27:55,717 --> 01:27:56,843
I don't know.

1270
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:10,491
Look...

1271
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,627
...I owe some people some money...

1272
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:16,367
...and I don't know how
I'm going to pay them back.

1273
01:28:16,438 --> 01:28:18,030
I got problems.

1274
01:28:18,473 --> 01:28:19,667
Gambling.

1275
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:21,434
Yeah.

1276
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:23,103
Yeah.

1277
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:26,803
You know, Frank...

1278
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:31,885
Why can't we just forget this shit?

1279
01:28:32,954 --> 01:28:35,422
Why can't we just get the fuck out of here?

1280
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:39,116
Maybe leave the country or something.

1281
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:47,724
- What are you doing?
- Take off your fucking shirt!

1282
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:50,596
What are you talking about?

1283
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:53,666
Just take off your shirt now.

1284
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:57,542
If there's nothing to worry about,
then I'll apologize.

1285
01:28:57,912 --> 01:29:00,039
But I'm not gonna argue.

1286
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:05,183
- Now take off your fucking shirt. Now!
- I can't believe this shit!

1287
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,855
After all we've been through,
you don't trust me?

1288
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:10,686
After all this shit you got me into,
you don't trust me?

1289
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:13,522
Take off your shirt.

1290
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:18,526
Or what?

1291
01:29:21,102 --> 01:29:22,899
Or you'll shoot me?

1292
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:25,204
Is that what you'll do, Frank?

1293
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:27,637
Kill me? Me, too?

1294
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,111
Then shoot.

1295
01:29:34,816 --> 01:29:38,308
I'll ask you one more motherfucking time.
Now take off the goddamn shirt.

1296
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,546
Take it off!

1297
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,157
Fuck!

1298
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:57,770
I can't fucking believe you.
I can't believe you.

1299
01:30:01,142 --> 01:30:02,837
Shit!

1300
01:30:03,311 --> 01:30:04,938
I'm sorry, man.

1301
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,078
You're right.

1302
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:11,815
I don't know what the fuck, man.
I'm just...

1303
01:30:12,387 --> 01:30:14,821
I'm fucking nervous, man, like you.

1304
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:18,554
Come on, forget it, all right?

1305
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:21,993
It's this fucking thing,
I'm telling you, it's this fucking thing.

1306
01:30:22,063 --> 01:30:24,327
I can't believe you did that.

1307
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,492
Really, man. Let's just do it.

1308
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:29,730
Let's just get it over with.

1309
01:30:39,914 --> 01:30:41,211
I'm sorry, man.

1310
01:30:43,485 --> 01:30:47,012
Look, I know I'm gonna feel
a whole lot better when she's dead.

1311
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:49,113
Then we're off the hook.

1312
01:30:49,557 --> 01:30:50,785
Whatever.

1313
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,997
What the fuck are you doing?

1314
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:03,401
You fucking asshole! You fucking asshole!

1315
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:05,939
You fucking rat! You fucking rat!

1316
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,041
- Yeah, I'm a fucking rat!
- Fucking A!

1317
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:11,101
Yeah, I fucking ratted you out!

1318
01:31:11,846 --> 01:31:13,711
Simms knows everything.

1319
01:31:14,415 --> 01:31:16,474
Go ahead. I don't give a fuck.

1320
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:19,485
Go ahead, blow my brains out.
I deserve to fucking die.

1321
01:31:19,554 --> 01:31:21,749
Fucking A right you do, man!

1322
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:33,896
Get out of the car.

1323
01:31:36,437 --> 01:31:37,404
Frank.

1324
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:41,937
Get out of the car now.

1325
01:31:54,189 --> 01:31:55,156
Frank.

1326
01:31:57,859 --> 01:32:00,919
This is why you can never lose
your sense of humor.

1327
01:33:19,674 --> 01:33:21,574
I hate my fucking life.

1328
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
Damn.

1329
01:33:50,905 --> 01:33:52,167
God!

1330
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,571
I hate my fucking life!

1331
01:33:55,777 --> 01:33:57,074
I hate it!

1332
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:21,567
Guess we caught you at a bad time.

1333
01:34:29,143 --> 01:34:31,304
But we all have problems.

1334
01:34:33,047 --> 01:34:35,140
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1335
01:34:43,024 --> 01:34:44,651
Divinci must've figured it out.

1336
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:47,217
I didn't think he'd kill
his own partner, though.

1337
01:34:47,295 --> 01:34:48,785
He's an animal.

1338
01:34:49,163 --> 01:34:50,721
The recorder's busted up...

1339
01:34:50,798 --> 01:34:53,767
...but we might be able
to salvage some of the tape.

1340
01:34:54,469 --> 01:34:56,334
I want him, you understand me?

1341
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:59,737
I don't care what it takes.
I want that son of a bitch.

1342
01:35:13,788 --> 01:35:14,880
Shit!

1343
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:17,515
Who the fuck are you?

1344
01:35:19,394 --> 01:35:20,827
Miss Webb...

1345
01:35:21,262 --> 01:35:22,695
...we'd like you to come with us.

1346
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:36,237
- Who set it up?
- I don't know.

1347
01:35:36,344 --> 01:35:38,938
- It was Divinci, wasn't it?
- I don't know.

1348
01:35:39,013 --> 01:35:41,573
Which one pulled the trigger,
Divinci or Rodriguez?

1349
01:35:41,682 --> 01:35:44,014
- I don't know.
- Detective Rodriguez is dead.

1350
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:45,780
He was shot in the head last night.

1351
01:35:46,254 --> 01:35:49,155
Rodriguez was wearing a recorder.
Divinci found it.

1352
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:52,886
- You can do addition, can't you?
- You are so full of shit.

1353
01:35:56,197 --> 01:35:58,062
Just tell us what you know.

1354
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,197
- Look, where's Divinci?
- We don't know.

1355
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:05,538
- But we're gonna find him.
- You're gonna find him? Yeah, right.

1356
01:36:05,606 --> 01:36:07,597
I don't know a fucking thing.

1357
01:36:07,675 --> 01:36:09,438
- Listen!
- Back off!

1358
01:36:10,778 --> 01:36:12,643
Hooper, get her out of here.

1359
01:36:19,487 --> 01:36:21,819
Get a copy of the tape to Baylor.

1360
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:23,919
Make sure it doesn't come from us.

1361
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:26,457
Your attorney is here.

1362
01:36:27,995 --> 01:36:29,553
What attorney?

1363
01:36:34,702 --> 01:36:35,999
Hi, Cynthia.

1364
01:36:36,337 --> 01:36:39,795
- Sit down, please.
- I got nothing to say.

1365
01:36:40,007 --> 01:36:42,601
Yes. So I'm told.

1366
01:36:43,744 --> 01:36:46,975
<i>F</i>o<i>rget It. Same shlt. </i>

<i>Yeah, I am. I'm a fucklng ratl</i>

<i>-I fucklng sh</i>o<i>uld dle. </i>
<i>-Yeah... </i>

1376
01:37:10,905 --> 01:37:13,430
I think you know my client is innocent.

1377
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:15,942
That's all I care about, my client.

1378
01:37:16,878 --> 01:37:19,346
But I understand why you're scared.

1379
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:23,138
You're already facing perjury charges,
and my guess is that...

1380
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:25,549
...you're in this a lot deeper.

1381
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:26,518
But I'm not after you.

1382
01:37:27,221 --> 01:37:29,314
I get nothing if you go to jail.

1383
01:37:29,624 --> 01:37:31,785
But I think that if I help you...

1384
01:37:33,494 --> 01:37:34,722
...you could help my client.

1385
01:37:35,997 --> 01:37:38,431
- How?
- Sit down, please.

1386
01:37:38,766 --> 01:37:40,529
William... Joe...

1387
01:37:41,335 --> 01:37:42,996
...didn't really do it, did he?

1388
01:37:44,906 --> 01:37:45,930
No.

1389
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:48,342
No, he didn't.

1390
01:37:48,476 --> 01:37:50,944
No goddamn way.
I'm won't grant that whore immunity.

1391
01:37:51,012 --> 01:37:53,446
She lied on the stand.
She's protecting somebody.

1392
01:37:53,548 --> 01:37:55,345
And she's involved.

1393
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:58,210
- I want them all.
- All right.

1394
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,220
Before I leave,
I want to remind you of something.

1395
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:02,916
You have shit for a case.

1396
01:38:02,990 --> 01:38:05,686
If you cared about seeing justice
for your dead comrade...

1397
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,159
...you wouldn't blow this deal.

1398
01:38:07,228 --> 01:38:11,028
Immunity for her testimony
is a small price for a bad cop.

1399
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:13,999
And that's the only way she's gonna talk.

1400
01:38:14,969 --> 01:38:18,735
And William McCall walks right now.
All charges dropped.

1401
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:25,842
If what she says is any good, I'll deal.
If it isn't, nobody goes anywhere.

1402
01:38:45,366 --> 01:38:46,890
Cynthia, sit down, please.

1403
01:38:57,278 --> 01:39:00,839
- How does it feel to be a free man again?
- Do you have any comments, sir?

1404
01:39:01,048 --> 01:39:03,209
Sorry, no more questions.
No more questions.

1405
01:39:03,317 --> 01:39:04,409
Thank you.

1406
01:39:04,752 --> 01:39:06,014
Thank you!

1407
01:39:58,472 --> 01:40:00,599
Guess you had no choice.

1408
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:04,978
You had to do the right thing.

1409
01:40:12,386 --> 01:40:14,149
Baby, look at you.

1410
01:40:17,091 --> 01:40:18,718
What do you want?

1411
01:40:19,794 --> 01:40:21,318
What do I want?

1412
01:40:22,196 --> 01:40:24,323
You're asking me what I want?

1413
01:40:25,366 --> 01:40:27,664
Are you gonna grant me three wishes?

1414
01:40:29,036 --> 01:40:30,435
Let's see...

1415
01:40:31,138 --> 01:40:33,197
...I don't know what to ask for.

1416
01:40:35,509 --> 01:40:37,409
Money would be nice.

1417
01:40:43,818 --> 01:40:45,615
Love would be better.

1418
01:40:48,055 --> 01:40:50,285
But a little fucking Ioyalty...

1419
01:40:52,393 --> 01:40:54,918
...you can never get enough of that.

1420
01:41:02,036 --> 01:41:04,004
We'll start with money.

1421
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:18,580
That's all I've got.

1422
01:41:20,721 --> 01:41:24,418
- They'll catch you.
- No. They don't got a clue, baby.

1423
01:41:24,492 --> 01:41:27,552
You know why?
'Cause I'm following my heart...

1424
01:41:28,295 --> 01:41:30,286
...and they don't know where that is.

1425
01:41:30,364 --> 01:41:32,059
What about your plans?

1426
01:41:32,133 --> 01:41:34,397
Why don't you tell me about
your fucking plans?

1427
01:41:34,468 --> 01:41:36,231
Maybe I'd like to hear them now.

1428
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:39,599
Plans.

1429
01:41:43,177 --> 01:41:44,235
Plans?

1430
01:41:47,081 --> 01:41:50,710
Once a Ioyalty's broken, baby,
you can never get it back.

1431
01:41:52,086 --> 01:41:54,281
You should not have told them.

1432
01:41:56,257 --> 01:41:59,488
There are a lot of things in my life
that I shouldn't have done.

1433
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,619
But that is not fucking one of them!

1434
01:42:01,695 --> 01:42:03,424
Move out of my way!

1435
01:42:05,599 --> 01:42:07,089
Let me tell you something.

1436
01:42:07,968 --> 01:42:11,233
The only difference between
a witness and a liar...

1437
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:14,737
...is just one of them knows
what he's doing.

1438
01:42:20,648 --> 01:42:21,774
No!

1439
01:43:07,595 --> 01:43:10,462
- Shit!
- Manny, lock the door.

1440
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:11,859
Lock it!

1441
01:43:12,566 --> 01:43:14,796
You scared the shit out of me.

1442
01:43:20,207 --> 01:43:21,299
Shit.

1443
01:43:23,844 --> 01:43:25,311
Manny.

1444
01:43:27,147 --> 01:43:28,614
One more favor.

1445
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:33,516
Now, since when did I become
such a good fucking friend?

1446
01:43:33,754 --> 01:43:37,053
Look, I'm thinking of taking
a little time off.

1447
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,388
Think you can get me a car tonight?

1448
01:43:45,799 --> 01:43:46,925
Yeah, man.

1449
01:43:48,068 --> 01:43:49,399
I can do that.

1450
01:43:50,304 --> 01:43:52,636
But you know
you're hot as hell right now, right?

1451
01:43:52,706 --> 01:43:54,401
And drivers that don't talk...

1452
01:43:54,975 --> 01:43:56,533
...don't come cheap.

1453
01:43:57,745 --> 01:43:58,973
I got the money.

1454
01:44:00,114 --> 01:44:01,604
Make it happen.

1455
01:44:04,118 --> 01:44:07,383
<i>Dr. Travls, y</i>o<i>u have a vlslt</i>o<i>r In R</i>oo<i>m 4.</i>

1456
01:44:07,454 --> 01:44:10,048
<i>Dr. Travls, a vlslt</i>o<i>r In R</i>oo<i>m 4.</i>

1457
01:44:12,693 --> 01:44:15,560
<i>Dr. Fl</i>o<i>rence, please dlal 112.</i>

1458
01:44:20,267 --> 01:44:24,169
<i>-Dr. Fl</i>o<i>rence, dlal 112.</i>
- You want to do the op. Report?

1459
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,264
- Not if you do.
- How did you close?

1460
01:44:34,381 --> 01:44:35,905
There you go, man.

1461
01:44:37,518 --> 01:44:40,954
Leather seats, mini-bar, CD player.

1462
01:44:41,455 --> 01:44:43,286
What more could you ask for?

1463
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:46,023
Better not be a setup.

1464
01:44:46,694 --> 01:44:48,958
You want me to hold your hand, too?

1465
01:44:51,665 --> 01:44:53,394
Walk me to the car.

1466
01:44:54,501 --> 01:44:55,593
Shit.

1467
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:15,587
- I guess I'll let you live.
- You're a real prince.

1468
01:45:15,656 --> 01:45:17,521
Give me my money, man.

1469
01:45:20,394 --> 01:45:23,886
- You never saw me.
- Yeah, don't I wish that was true. Go on!

1470
01:45:26,133 --> 01:45:28,533
Thank you, sir.

1471
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:33,770
Have a nice trip, shit.

1472
01:45:38,445 --> 01:45:39,571
Go south.

1473
01:45:40,214 --> 01:45:42,011
Get on the Interstate.

1474
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:44,543
Don't break the speed limit.

1475
01:45:52,393 --> 01:45:54,884
You know, that's the thing about life.

1476
01:45:56,563 --> 01:45:59,498
You can never, ever
lose your sense of humor.

1477
01:46:01,301 --> 01:46:03,394
Without it, you got nothing.
