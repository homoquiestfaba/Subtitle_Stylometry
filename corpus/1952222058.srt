00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,813
All right. $1,000.

161
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,913
- [Chuckling]
- This is so much fun.

162
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,049
What?

163
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,821
<i>It's a little low, Mom.</i>

164
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,989
- <i>Offer me, say, 2,500.</i>
- All right, then.

165
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,567
2,500.

166
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,569
- No.
- <i>What do you mean, no?</i>

167
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,434
You just said, "Offer me 2,500."

168
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,568
I can let you have it for 33, Mrs. Devereaux,
but that's as low as I can go.

169
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,612
2,700.

170
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,374
3,275.

171
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:14,784
2,950, Fred, or we're out of here
faster than a cat in a rainstorm.

172
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,015
- Huh?
- <i>[George] What about Dad?</i>

173
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,149
What does he have to say about all this?

174
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,696
Your father has betrayed us,
and I never wanna hear his name again.

175
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,697
What about marrying my father again?

176
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,563
Once was an adventure.
Twice would be a perversion.

177
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,105
Look, you can't just take a kid
away from his father like this.

178
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,799
Ask any psychiatrist.
A boy needs his father's influence.

179
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,277
- That is what the telephone is for.
- I'm not going.

180
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,576
- Well, who's gonna drive the car?
- Robbie can drive.

181
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,480
Robbie doesn't have
the personality for driving.

182
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,782
- I'm too sensitive.
- You're too full of shit is what you are.

183
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,482
- George!
- Then you drive it.

184
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,582
It would not be appropriate
for me to drive it.

185
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,218
It's 1953, Mom.
Women vote now.

186
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,820
They smoke. They even
go to the bathroom by themselves.

187
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,456
You're becoming very crude, darling.

188
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,467
Your father's influence, no doubt.

189
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,338
Nice car.

190
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,437
<i>The only reason why I'm giving in...</i>

191
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,446
is because I know that
we'll be back here in a week.

192
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,039
It's time for your boy's medicine, ma'am.

193
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,278
- Bernice has your medicine, George. Take it.
- <i>It's not my medicine.</i>

194
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,287
I do not care whose medicine it is.

195
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,085
Just one of you take it,
and let's get out of here.

196
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,160
Good-bye, Bernice.

197
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,752
<i>I'll miss you.</i>
<i>Any parting words of advice for us?</i>

198
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,765
Yeah. Take the parking brake off.

199
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,198
- <i>[Gears Grinding]</i>
- <i>[Robbie] George! George!</i>

200
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,708
- Please don't get us killed.
- [Tires Screeching]

201
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,372
<i>[Narrating] My mother was</i>
<i>determined to teach my father a lesson...</i>

202
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,950
<i>even if it meant</i>
<i>killing us all in the process.</i>

203
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,646
<i>With that in mind, she told us</i>
<i>to drive around the city for an hour...</i>

204
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,952
<i>so she could teach me everything</i>
<i>she knew about driving a car...</i>

205
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,185
- <i>which wasn't much.</i>
- <i>[Brakes Screech]</i>

206
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,193
George, I almost stabbed myself.

207
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,354
- You wanna drive?
- That was a lovely stop.

208
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,695
You're a natural, darling.
Well, I think we're ready to go.

209
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,167
- Anywhere in particular?
- Boston.

210
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,498
- Boston?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,541
- For how long?
- Well, with a little luck, forever.

212
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,701
What are we going to do in Boston?

213
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,711
We're gonna start a new life.

214
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,409
We are going to have fun, that's what.
My dear friend Julie Harper lives there.

215
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,352
- Bette Davis was born in Boston.
- Boston is a very elegant city.

216
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,650
It's full of museums and universities.

217
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,850
- Tea parties.
- Precisely.

218
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,223
Accelerate, darling.

219
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,697
- Put the pedal to the metal, George.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

220
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,428
- What did you just do?
- I was checking the rear view mirror.

221
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,131
Oh. Never, never look
in the rear view mirror, darling.

222
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,207
It makes no difference what's behind you.

223
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,708
I don't even know why
they put those up there.

224
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,177
Just look where you're going
and pretend that that's not even there.

225
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,441
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

226
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,414
Now go.

227
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,252
<i>[Narrating] The whole drive up</i>

<i>Around Hartford, her euphoria</i>
<i>was sounding a little forced.</i>

230

<i>It made me think.</i>
<i>By the time we got to Boston...</i>

231
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,160
<i>she'd proclaim this was all</i>
<i>a big misunderstanding...</i>

232
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,204
<i>and tell me to turn around</i>
<i>and drive us back to New York.</i>

233
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,206
<i>But she didn't.</i>

234
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,243
We'll stay here until
Julie returns from her cruise.

235
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,108
- Mom, isn't this place a little...
- Isn't it a little what?

236
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,409
Well, don't you think that
we should be saving our money?

237
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,850
Certainly not.
What an unpleasant thought.

238
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,945
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.

239
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,025
- Are you okay?
- I'm very sorry.

- Oh, my goodness. Ann Devereaux.
- Wallace...

241
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,562
- Ann Devereaux.
- Wallace McCallister!

242
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,461
<i>[Ann] Wally's an old beau of mine,</i>
<i>and he's divorced.</i>

243
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,431
He once asked me to marry him.

244
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,733
<i>He tried to kill himself when I turned</i>
<i>him down. Unsuccessfully, of course.</i>

245
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
Great. He deserves another chance.

246
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,373
Well, if that's the way you wanna put it.

247
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,776
So, is this the look
we're going for, Robbie?

248
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:06,181
I'm trying to find you a balance between
Dorothy Malone and Donna Reed.

249
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,277
- Try this one.
- I'm completely in your hands, darling.

250
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,119
- You're like some predator.
- I'm merely having dinner with an old friend.

251
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,750
Like the angler fish we studied in biology.

252
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,489
Never compare a woman to a fish, George...

253
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,465
- or anything with scales for that matter.
- Here. Try these.

254
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,763
[Gasps]
They're perfect.

255
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,569
We're newcomers here, and Wallace

256
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,644
whose friendship will help
establish us in the community.

257
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,112
I got a feeling this is all gonna
come flying right back in your face.

268
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,725
Well, sometimes,

Things are bad for me, Ann.
They're bad.

274
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:58,629
Well, divorce is a terrible experience.

275
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,791
But sometimes, good things can come from...
from trials like ours.

276
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,531
I'm not talking about divorce.
I'm talking about... my business.

277
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,369
- Oh, your business.
- Yeah.

278
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:14,071

Lower your voice, Wallace.

281
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,991
It's why I wanted to see you tonight.

282
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,921

- Dollars?
- All right, 50.

286
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:44,506
Fifty. And I will get it back to you
by the end of the month, I swear to God.

287
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,137
It's not appropriate for you

- Madam, please.
- Listen, I am the victim here.

302
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,029
I returned from the ladies' room
to find that my purse has been ransacked.

00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,668
Madam, all I know is that
someone needs to pay for this meal.

Yes, of course. Harlan.
Well, Colonel.

<i>slapping me on the back...</i>

What was your father like?

I saw a picture of him once.
His pants were too short.

That's 'cause Stalin

That's why we're fighting
Communism, boys.

332

- Right, George?
- Yes, sir.

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:02,263
Hell, if the Commies did take over,
everybody would be wearing the same clothes.

335

Every street would have
the same exact stores...

each the same as the next.

00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,376
Mom, don't worry about us.
We'll be fine. She's a great dancer.

651
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,421
Well, maybe your mother
could teach us to do the Charleston.

652
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,616
I could probably teach you
a lot of things, child.

- Oh, no.

Look, um, I should be
at the William Penn at 11:00.

656
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,898
You and I could, uh, sneak off
and do some serious catching up.

657

- That sounds like fun, Charlie.
- Good.

your father, aren't you?

663

So what if I am?

664
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,856
What are you gonna say to him?

665
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,826
That I wanna go back to New York
and live with him.

666
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,699
I'm not gonna let you do that, George.

<i>We have no money.</i>

669
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,616
He doesn't want you.

670
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,414
- He does too want me.
- <i>You don't know him like I do.</i>

671
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,150

that he'll take me back in a minute.

George. I know
this has been hard for you.

673
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,495
But things will change soon, I promise.

674
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:58,762
How? How will they change?

675

- You know that for a fact, do you?
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.

679

- In an apartment on the South Side.

- Yeah.

Your mother always thought
she was too good to work.

I hate to be the one
to break it to you, kid...

742

but your mother has got
delusions of grandeur.

743

- No, she doesn't.
- Mm-hmm.

of southern royalty, man, you know.

It's pretty obvious that you're not

When you were two...

or maybe three years old...

859
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,335
you came down with something awful.

860
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,344
Like an earache or something.

861
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,346
Well, whatever it was, you were crying...

862
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,747
and nothin' anybody did
could make you stop.

863
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:05,686
Until your father came into your room...

864
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,919
sat down on your bed,
and started playing his clarinet.

865
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,592
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

866
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:17,155
And whenever he would stop,
you would just start crying again.

867
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:21,966
So he just kept on playing nonstop
for what felt like days.

868
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,939
