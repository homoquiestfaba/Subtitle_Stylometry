00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:24,010
She said it would be the
best summer ever, and it was.

5
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,014
I wanted it to last for
the rest of our lives.

6
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,418
As much as I hate what she did
to me, I will always love her.

MAN: Good morning, Mrs. Conrad.

10
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,433
Hi, Brent.

11
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,434
Hi.

12
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,339
Hi, Felicia.

Keep it going.

There you go.

17
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,318
There you go.

18
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,787
Keep going.

19
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,290
You can do it, Lauren!

20
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,292
Bring it in, sweetheart.

21
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,393
Yes, honey!

25
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,938
is Lauren Conrad.

26
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,806
Congratulations!

27
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:34,741
Did you see my mom?

28
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,742
Did you see me win?

29
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,210
Of course, I did, darling.

30
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,545
And that's the first
medal of the summer.

31
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,446
Come on, Lauren.

32
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,348
Let's look at your medal.

33
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,383
Congratulations.

34
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,284
Thanks.

[chatter]

36
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,290
You must be very proud
of your swimmers, today.

37
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,557
You really whipped
them into shape.

38
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,427
It's so early in the summer.

39
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,095
Thanks, Mrs. Conrad.

40
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,031
Matt, we've known
each other for years.

41
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,768
Don't you think it's
time you call me Vivian?

42
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,337
OK, sure.

43
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,471
ANNOUNCER: Your
attention, please.

44
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,773
Next Wednesday the 14th--

45
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,643
Hey, how about a
picture of the winner?

46
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,412
Matt, we need the coach, too.

47
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,887
Come on, guys, smile.

48
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,294
Say, Matt, we're going
to throw some steaks

49
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,595
on the grill tonight.

50
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,165
One more wouldn't
be any trouble.

51
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,900
Well, I-- I don't know.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,801
LAUREN: Come on, Matt.

53
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,536
Please, come?

54
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,271
OK, sure, yeah,
sounds like fun.

55
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,939
Yay!

56
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,574
Good.

57
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,576
Justin will be glad, too.

58
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,978
We have so much to catch up on.

59
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,879
Thank you, Mrs.--

60
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,780
Vivian.

61
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,315
Dinner is at 7:30.

62
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,084
OK.

63
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,386
So are you off the clock yet?

64
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,255
Uh, n-- no, I still
got to punch out.

65
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,758
Are you coming to the party
at the Winstead's this weekend?

66
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,926
Of course, he's coming.

67
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,961
My man, Matt, would
never miss a big blowout.

68
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,096
Would you, Matt?

69
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,066
[sighs] Actually, I got
some stuff I need to do.

70
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,435
Oh, well, I hope
that you can make it.

71
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,473
Uh, I think we'd have
a pretty good time.

72
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,174
Bye, Matt.

73
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,275
I'll see you, Alec.

74
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,276
You bet.

75
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,083
What is the matter?

76
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,153
Diane's really hot for you.

77
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,054
What do you need?

78
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:28,955
A tour guide?

79
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,690
An engraved invitation?

80
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,725
A note from your mother?

81
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,128
Is that all you
think about is sex?

82
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,496
Yeah.

83
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,730
Look, face it, man.

84
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,766
Sooner or later, you've
got to do it with somebody.

85
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,634
Well, maybe that
someone hasn't come along.

86
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,136
Look, Diane is a sure thing!

87
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,270
Go for it!

88
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,973
Look, when it
happens, it'll happen.

89
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,307
Yeah, but at the
rate you're going,

90
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,277
you'll probably collect
Social Security first.

91
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,378
Come on.

92
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,295
[doorbell ringing]

93
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,329
Oh, I'll get it, Mrs. Conrad.

94
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,464
No, no, I'll get it, Maggie.

95
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,732
You finish the salad.

96
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,119
Hi.

97
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,354
Hi.

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,356
Um, I hope I'm not too early.

99
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,759
No, not at all.

100
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,760
Come in.

101
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,505
Would you like a drink?

102
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,307
Yeah, yeah, a
beer would be great.

103
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,613
Lauren's going to be
so excited you're here.

104
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,614
She's right outside.

105
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,154
Looks like you survived
your freshman year.

106
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,455
How are your grades?

107
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,258
Uh, Dean's list
both semesters.

108
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,928
Congratulations.

109
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,830
I do hope, though,
that you managed to do

110
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,199
something more than study.

111
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,034
Uh, not really.

112
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,805
It's what summer
vacations are for.

113
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,174
Are you still diving?

114
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:33,446
Um, not as much as I used
to when I was competing.

115
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,648
The pool at school is
really always crowded.

116
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,183
Hey, Matt.

117
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,151
Hey, squirt.

118
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,453
VIVIAN CONRAD: Lauren
has not taken off

119
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,787
that medal since we got home.

120
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,688
Wow!

121
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:43,656
LAUREN: Do you like it?

122
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,825
MATT TEMPLETON:
Yeah, that's great.

123
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,260
I got a new video game.

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,728
Do you want to go
upstairs and play it?

125
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,296
Oh, maybe some other
time, sweetheart.

126
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,632
But right now, Maggie could
use your help in the kitchen.

127
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,933
OK.

128
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,768
All right, I'll see
you later, squirt, OK?

129
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,769
See you later, Matt.

130
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,841
I think somebody's
got a crush on you.

131
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,543
[chuckles awkwardly]
She's a great kid.

132
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,886
I don't know where Justin is.

133
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,823
He was supposed to
be home an hour ago.

134
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,160
Matt, how do you feel
about starting the fire?

135
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,995
No problem.

136
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,330
OK.

137
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,733
So how late does Mr.
Conrad usually work?

138
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,402
Depends.

139
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,605
I stopped trying to keep
up with Justin's schedules.

140
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,710
[door closing]

141
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,744
Speak of the devil.

142
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:48,220
Well, company for dinner.

143
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,221
Any calls?

144
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,122
No.

145
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,791
Uh.

146
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,392
Nice to see you, Matt.
How is school?

147
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,560
- It was great, Mr. Conrad.
- Good.

148
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,361
- Daddy!
- Uh-huh.

149
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,829
Look what I won!

150
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,730
Whoa!

151
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,965
Look at that thing!

152
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,634
Congratulations, sweetie!

153
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,236
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't there.

154
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,304
That's OK, dad.

155
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,806
No, no, I'll be
there next time.

156
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,707
I promise.

157
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,641
LAUREN: Really?

158
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,642
JUSTIN CONRAD: Really.

159
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,078
VIVIAN CONRAD: Of
course, he will.

160
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,346
Matt, would you
excuse me a minute?

161
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,847
I'm going to go get out
of this suit, all right?

162
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,881
Sure, I'm in no hurry, sir.

163
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:16,949
Here, come on.

164
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:17,850
Grab that.

165
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,018
Yeah, take your time.

166
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,019
JUSTIN CONRAD: All right.

167
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,863
[music playing]

168
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,733
So have you thought
about what you

169
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,802
want to do after you graduate?

170
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,004
No, sir, not really.

171
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,405
Mm.

172
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,407
Justin, maybe Matt would like
to learn about your securities

173
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,443
business while he's home.

174
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,411
Yeah, good idea.

175
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,712
Would that interest you, Matt?

176
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,282
Yeah, that would be great,
but I know how busy you are.

177
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,451
No, I'm sure we can
work something out.

178
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,352
[phone ringing]

179
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,720
Excuse me.

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,688
Yeah.

181
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,589
Yeah, hold on.

182
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,757
This is Bailey from the office.

183
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,758
This could take a while.

184
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,526
Why don't you two
finish without me?

185
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,361
Sorry.

186
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,230
Yeah.

187
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,465
Well, what do they counter with?

188
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,367
You're kidding.

189
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:13,039
No, that's unacceptable from
our standpoint, you know that.

190
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,375
When did they say
they'd call again?

191
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,410
Who?

192
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,679
Yamasura?

193
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,614
But don't you have a
connection inside his office?

194
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,317
Are you listening to me?

195
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,090
Oh, no, I can't
do it on Thursday.

196
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,061
I-- I have a lesson to go to.

197
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,162
Well, then change--

198
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,530
VIVIAN CONRAD: It's been
very nice having you

199
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,464
here this evening, Matt.

200
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,734
[sensual music]

201
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,437
Bill, you're not listening.

202
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,806
Hey, that's your job,
not mine, all right?

203
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,179
Bill, I want you
to go talk to him.

204
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,080
I'll be by tomorrow.

205
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,214
Thanks.

206
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,316
Look, I think I should go.

207
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,519
JUSTIN CONRAD: I want this
cleared up by lunch tomorrow.

208
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,021
Thanks for a
really nice evening.

209
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,190
JUSTIN CONRAD: I said lunchtime.

210
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,791
Would you tell Mr.
Conrad I said goodbye?

211
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,333
[chuckles]

212
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,903
[children chattering]

213
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,115
I'll get the rest of
my bags out of the car.

214
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,696
What-- what is he doing here?

215
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,599
Your father decided it's
time for him to come back home.

216
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,034
[scoffs] Mom, you've
got to be kidding?

217
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,874
Matt, he's been sober
for six months now.

218
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,775
Says who?

219
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,510
Is that what he told you?

220
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,178
Mom, I can't believe
you're giving in to him

221
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,246
after what he did to you.

222
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,414
He can't afford to
rent his own apartment

223
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,083
and pay the mortgage
on this house anymore.

224
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,385
Well, he should have thought
about that before he moved out.

225
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,125
Hi, Matt.

226
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:35,314
Son, I want to put
the past behind us.

227
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,049
I'm sure you do.

228
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,050
What did you say?

229
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:42,922
Nothing.

230
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:43,956
No, what did you say?

231
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,163
Nothing.

232
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,834
Look, whether you like it
or not, I'm moving back in.

233
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,569
I don't need your permission.

234
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,489
ANNOUNCER: Mr. Green and party
to the first tee, please.

235
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,124
Mr. Green and party
to the first tee.

236
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,492
And when you're done
with those towels,

237
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,795
my car could use a wash and wax.

238
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,964
Don't hold your breath.

239
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,198
A little testy.

240
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,967
[sighs] Yeah.

241
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,336
Yeah, I'm sorry.

242
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,371
My old man moved back in.

243
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,772
Oh, that's a drag.

244
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,474
Yeah, I knew he
couldn't leave us alone.

245
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,743
I-- I knew he'd worm
his way back in somehow.

246
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,644
You never know, man.

247
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,745
Maybe he's changed.

248
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,213
[scoffs] Changed?

249
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,948
My old man?

250
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,783
He'll never change.

251
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,086
Yeah, well, father
or no father, you're

252
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,055
coming to the party tonight
whether you want to or not.

253
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,559
I won't let you pull your little
shy act again this summer.

254
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,629
Do I have to wear a tux?

255
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,332
Yep, but don't worry,
I got you covered.

256
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,667
I'm warning you, man.

257
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,502
You better watch out.

258
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,005
You might just have a
little bit of fun tonight.

259
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,073
Mwah Catch.

260
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:08,974
Mwah.

261
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,409
Hey!
[reggae music]

262
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,477
(SINGING) Paradise nights.

263
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,978
Mr. Paradise Nights.

264
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,715
Paradise nights.

265
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,217
Mr. Paradise Nights.

266
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,589
Give us a look, come on.

267
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,657
[sighs]

268
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,259
And you know you're
almost presentable.

269
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,260
Do we have to do this?

270
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,962
Yes, you do.

271
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,297
[sighs]

272
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,698
Let's go.

273
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,699
[chatter]

274
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,267
WOMAN: Hello!

275
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,268
Hi!

276
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

277
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,151
Excuse me.

278
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,422
You look wonderful.

279
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,489
Thanks, so do you.

280
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,158
Where's Justin tonight?

281
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,392
Chicago on business.

282
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,862
Oh, poor baby's all alone.

283
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,465
[chuckles] Yes, all alone.

284
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,568
[laughs]

285
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,638
[sighs] I have to go be a wife.

286
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,572
All right.

287
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,740
I'll catch up with
you in a minute.

288
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,741
OK.

289
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,882
Hi, Vivian.

290
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,850
HI.

291
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,952
You look wonderful.

292
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm interested
to hear all about.

293
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,289
It's about 150--

294
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,557
Well, well, well.

295
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,958
Justin's out of town, I take it.

296
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,893
[chuckles awkwardly]
Whatever gave that idea, Frank?

297
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,328
Oh, just a lucky guess.

298
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,931
Uh, uh, exactly what do
you think you're doing?

299
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,299
Merely, my dear,
taking advantage

300
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,801
of a perfect situation.

301
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,737
But thanks, but
no thanks, Frank.

302
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,538
Got one like you at home.

303
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,073
[chuckles]

304
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,512
Yes, OK.

305
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,513
Well, that's--

306
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,558
[applause]

307
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,563
He looks like he
could use some company.

308
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,931
I think I'll go talk to him.

309
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,604
Vivian, you are
absolutely shameless.

310
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,473
[chuckles] How do I look?

311
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,942
[reggae music]

312
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,077
Irresistible.

313
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,591
(SINGING) Human eyes.

314
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,795
The Earth and now.

315
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,230
Human eyes.

316
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,634
The Earth.

317
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,070
Human eyes.

318
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,506
The Earth and now.

319
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,707
Mind if I join you?

320
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,608
No.

321
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,743
No, not at all.

322
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,518
Are you having a good time?

323
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,220
I guess so.

324
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,423
[chuckles] You
don't sound so sure.

325
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,060
I-- I feel sort of
out of place here.

326
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,830
Why is that?

327
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,300
A lot of these people used to
be, um, friends of my parents

328
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,334
before--

329
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,671
before my dad's
business went under.

330
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,040
I never really know
what to say to them.

331
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,677
Well, you seemed just fine
when you're at the club.

332
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,980
People treat you differently
when you work for them.

333
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,216
Oh, Matt.

334
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,885
Don't let any of these people
make you feel uncomfortable,

335
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,353
not for a minute, believe me.

336
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,922
They are just not worth it.

337
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,258
It's easy for you to say.

338
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,659
Not really.

339
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,628
It used to bother
me, too, at first.

340
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,067
You seem so relaxed.

341
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,902
It's probably because I
just got to learn how to play

342
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,403
their games, that's all.

343
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,776
I'm from a small town, Matt.

344
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,045
I'm a preacher's daughter.

345
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
I didn't grow up with
all these people.

346
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,084
[laughter]

The Earth and now.

349
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,726
Lauren and I got
a little surprise

350
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,060
for you this afternoon.

351
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:22,961
Really?

352
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,163
Uh-huh.

353
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,631
I mean, just a little
something to say

354
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,766
thank you for all the time
you spent coaching her.

355
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,771
Let's get out of here.

356
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,339
Why don't you put on
something more comfortable

357
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,275
and drop by my house and
pick up your present?

358
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,457
And here's a little something
extra for staying late tonight.

359
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,392
Oh, you didn't have
to do that, Mrs. Conrad.

360
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,293
No, really, I want to.

361
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,494
Please, Maggie, take it.

362
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,796
I feel bad about keeping
you away from your family

363
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:58,830
on a Saturday night.

364
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,965
MAGGIE: Well, thank
you very much.

365
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,934
VIVIAN CONRAD: Oh,
you're welcome.

366
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,935
Goodnight.

00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,533
[sensual music]

369
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,847
Where is everybody?

370
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,682
Lauren's upstairs asleep.

371
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,052
She's going to be very
upset she missed seeing you.

372
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,554
And Justin's out of town.

373
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,998
So when is Mr.
Conrad getting back?

374
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,132
I haven't the faintest idea.

375
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,004
I'd like to propose a toast.

376
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,808
To the best summer ever.

377
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,146
To the best summer ever.

378
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,429
Here, open it up.

379
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,630
I think you're going to love it.

380
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,723
Well, aren't you
going to try it on?

381
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,858
Where?

382
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,061
What's wrong with right here?

383
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,268
Matt, I see you in much
less than that at the pool.

384
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,569
It's just a shirt.

385
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,603
Slip it on.

386
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:22,974
OK.

387
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,588
I better go.

388
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,124
I wish you wouldn't.

389
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,024
Matt.

390
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,326
I shouldn't even be here.

391
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,062
Th-- thanks for the shirt.

392
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,096
Matt?

393
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,466
I'd really like you to stay.

394
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,702
I can't do this.

395
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,238
Well, you can trust me.

396
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:33,512
I-- I haven't been with
that many girls before.

397
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,115
[sensual music]

398
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,788
I'm a very good teacher.

399
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,448
[sensual music]

400
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,026
Is everything OK?

401
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,794
Yes, Lauren's sound asleep.

402
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,669
Can I ask you something?

403
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,670
Of course.

404
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,574
Did, um--

405
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:32,617
[chuckles awkwardly]
was-- was that good?

406
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:37,122
[chuckles] Terrific.

407
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,189
Really?

408
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,792
(CHUCKLING) Mm-hmm.

409
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,261
Really.

410
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:48,233
The truth is, um,
tonight was my first time.

411
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,437
I-- I just feel like I
should tell you that.

412
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,371
I-- I don't know why.

413
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:58,043
I-- I just thought
you should know.

414
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,112
That's very special, Matt.

415
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,683
I'm quite flattered.

416
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,317
Does that mean I
can see you again?

417
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:21,733
The best summer
ever, remember?

418
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,673
But you do have to
promise me one thing.

419
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,674
Anything.

420
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:38,717
While this can be as wonderful
a summer as you want it to be,

421
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:44,489
as long as we keep this
just between you and me.

422
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,325
But what about Mr. Conrad?

423
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,296
I thought I told you to
let me worry about Justin.

424
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,565
I know, I know, but what if--

425
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,569
Matt, you have got to
tell me and promise me

426
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,206
that you will not say one
word about this to anyone.

427
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,411
Promise?

428
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,180
I promise.

429
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,381

[chatter]

433
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,471
What are you looking at?

434
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:12,210
[chuckles] The look on
your face says it all.

435
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,545
Nothing serious, Jackie.

436
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,679
You know that.

437
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:19,517
[chuckles] Yes, but
the question is, does he?

438
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,686
He's adorable, isn't he?

439
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,521
There's just this
innocence about him

440
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,089
that I find fascinating.

441
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,259
[laughs]

442
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,497
Well, if you can tear yourself
away from Mr. Fascinating,

443
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,565
our court is ready.

444
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,942
SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): The
bottom of the fifth inning.

[phone ringing]

446
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,477
MATT TEMPLETON: I got it.

447
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,812
SPORTSCASTER (ON TV):
The prospects look

448
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,315
good in the fourth when
the bases were loaded.

449
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,649

CHARLES TEMPLETON: Hello?

453
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,754
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON
PHONE): Charles.

454
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,956
CHARLES TEMPLETON: Hi, Vivian.

455
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,090
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE):
It's been a long time.

456
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,758
Yes, it-- it has
been a long time.

457
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,060
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON
PHONE): Is Matt home?

458
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,328
Matt?

459
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,896
Yes, he's-- he's here.

460
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,397
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE):
May I speak to him?

461
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,398
Just a minute.

462
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,538
Hello?

463
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,340
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): I hope
it's all right that I called.

464
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,444
Of course.

465
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,379
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd forgotten about me.

466
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,814
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON
PHONE): After the evening

467
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,050
we spent together, how could I?

468
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,585
Where are you?

469
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,454
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE):
Look out your front window.

470
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,400
So want to play a little
tennis for a while?

471
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,401
I'll be right out.

472
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:24,242
So I take it we're not
going to play tennis?

473
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,446
Would you like to play tennis?

474
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,863
I have been wanting to
do this all day long.

475
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,112
[upbeat music]

476
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,016
MATT TEMPLETON: I'd say you
have been officially stood up.

477
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,117
ALEC: Man, she'll show.

478
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,419
I'm telling you, this
girl really digs me.

479
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,654
Whoa!

480
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,222
Inspiration has arrived.

481
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,418
Viv, I have a little
surprise for you.

482
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,220
I've rented a house
at the beach for us.

483
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,092
A whole week of nothing but
sea and sun, just and me, hm?

484
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,696
Justin, that's wonderful.

485
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,797
I called your folks.

486
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,499
They'd be happy to take
Lauren for the week.

487
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,337
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

488
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,740
Of course, we haven't been
away together in a long time.

489
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,349
Hey, Matt.

490
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,450
Matt!

491
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,052
Uh, Matt, what do
you want to drink?

492
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,153
You drinking anything?

493
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,154
Uh, nothing.

494
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,329
Excuse me, for a
minute, will you?

495
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,833
[chatter]

496
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,883
Well, hello there.

497
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:46,851
What are you doing here?

498
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,654
I might ask you
the same question.

499
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,589
The girl you're with is pretty.

500
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,524
Yeah.

501
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,426
Y-- yeah.

502
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,061
Alec keeps trying to
set me up with her.

503
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,297
I-- I got stuck.

504
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,331
No, no, really, I--

505
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,966
I-- there was nothing
I could do about it.

506
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:06,404
Matt, I'm just teasing you.

507
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,106
Oh, right.

508
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,679
I tried calling
you this afternoon.

509
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,746
That's funny.

510
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,615
Maggie didn't say there
were any messages.

511
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,117
Messages?
I'm not crazy.

512
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,351
I didn't leave any messages.

513
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,423
I've been thinking
about you all day.

514
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,424
Really?

515
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,497
When can I see you again?

516
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,233
I'm free tomorrow.

517
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,003
I'll arrange for Maggie
to take Lauren someplace.

518
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,839
And we can spend part
of the day together.

519
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:42,840
That would be great.

520
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,348
Whoa, little jumpy, aren't we?

521
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,215
I-- I, uh--

522
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,116
Hello, Matt.

523
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,284
Hi, Mr. Conrad.

524
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,120
I-- I was just telling,
uh, Mrs. Conrad that I--

525
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,423
I've been meaning to drop by
the office and-- and see you.

526
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,691
I-- I've been really busy.

527
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,592
Any time.

528
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,960
Any time at all, Matt.

529
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,769
Well, thanks.

530
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,275
Uh, just a minute.

531
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,076
Lauren won't be at swim
practice this week.

532
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,478
Viv and I are going
to be going out

533
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:26,184
of town, so, uh, Lauren will be
staying with her grandparents.

534
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,186
Is that a problem?

535
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,086
No.

536
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:29,987
No, sir, not at all.

537
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:30,888
Good.

538
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,123
Always nice to see you, Matt.

539
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,162
[chatter]

540
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,501
They're all out.

541
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,241
I can't believe you're going
away with him for that long.

542
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,742
Matt, it's only a week.

543
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,178
Yeah, but the summer is
short enough as it is, Vivian.

544
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,013
School's starting soon.

545
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,616
Oh, Matt, look,
don't do this to me.

546
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,290
Justin planned this trip.

547
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,729
He just dropped it on
me out of the blue.

548
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,899
What was I supposed to do?

549
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,338
You're going to miss me?

550
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,511
Of course, I'm
going to miss you.

551
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,748
You're going to miss me?

552
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,116
Let me show you how much.

553
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,561

[clock chiming]

557
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,050
Your mother was worried
half out of her mind

558
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,919
when you didn't come
home last night.

559
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,254
I told her I'd be late.

560
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,490
This isn't late, Matt.

561
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,792
It's dawn.

562
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,261
Where the hell have
you been anyway?

563
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,162
None of your business.

564
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,163
Matt.

565
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,435
As long as you're living under
this roof, everything you do

566
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,436
is my business.

567
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,615
Look, I just want to make sure
you're not doing something

568
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,584
you'll be sorry for later.

569
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,220
Get real.

570
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,357
You don't care about me.

571
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,593
You don't care
about mom, either.

572
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,262
And the only reason why
you're back in this house

573
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,463
is because you're flat broke.

574
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,071
There's the dad I know.

[moans]

579
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,859
Look, I hate to do
this, but I have

580
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,528
to fly back to Chicago tonight.

581
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,196
The Cramer deal's falling apart.

582
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,101
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

583
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,937
[sighs] Because I didn't
want to disappoint you.

584
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,605
Oh.

585
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,542
This is so typical
of you, Justin.

586
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,143
You say you want us
to be alone together,

587
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,379
then you just run off on
business the first time

588
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,480
the phone rings.

589
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,851
Business is what pays
for vacations like this.

590
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,387
Business puts a
roof over your head

591
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,022
and a tennis racket
in your hand.

592
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,691
I'm sorry you find my
business so offensive.

593
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,229
How long are you
going to be gone?

594
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,498
[sighs] Well, if I'm
lucky, only a day or two.

595
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,966
And I'll probably have
to go straight back

596
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,200
to the office when I return.

597
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,277
Look, I'm sorry.

598
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,351
I better go pack.

599
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:14,124
[phone ringing]

600
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,060
Hello?

601
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,529
Hi, I'm glad it's you.

602
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,564
MATT TEMPLETON (ON
PHONE): Hey, how are you?

603
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,067
I'm fine, but I miss you.

604
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,903
Are you where you can talk?

605
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,072
Uh, sort of.

606
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,173
What's up?

607
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:34,144
Well, Justin had to
leave on business today.

608
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,546
I can leave right now.

609
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,849
Mm, why don't you
come down tomorrow.

610
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,319
But you call me just as
soon as you get to town, OK?

611
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,954
I'll give you the number.

612
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:44,955
OK.

613
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,593
See you tomorrow.

614
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,732
Who was that, honey?

615
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,468
Uh, Tommy Ferguson.

616
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,203
Oh, your old roommate.

617
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,071
Yeah, yeah.

618
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,007
Um, he wants me to come
up to his parent's cabin.

619
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,943
A bunch of friends
are there from school.

620
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,311
When?

621
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,212
Tomorrow.

622
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,514
I can be there before lunch.

623
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,350
What about work?

624
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,718
I'll get somebody
to replace me.

[uplifting music]

626
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,965
VIVIAN CONRAD: You did it!

627
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,566
Oh, it looks great!

628
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,506
Yes!

629
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,314
Come on!

630
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,382
Let me hold it.

631
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,283
Oh!

632
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,453
[chuckles]

633
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,255
You still have the kite?

634
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,256
I still have the kite.

635
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,323
Do I have to hold this kite now?

636
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,291
Yes.

637
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,292
I might not.

638
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,260
I might let go.

639
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,161
You better.

640
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:02,099
[chuckles] OK, I'll hold it.

00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:18,215
I wish the wind could
pick us up like that

644
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,783
and never bring us back.

645
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:37,401
Yeah, Mom, hi.

646
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,872
I just wanted you to know,
uh, I got here safe and sound.

647
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,508
OK, I'll be home in
a couple of days.

648
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:47,411
OK, bye.

649
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,512
That was so sweet.

650
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,383
I don't like my mom to worry.

651
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:57,154
Well, all mothers worry
about their children.

652
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,256
Yeah, well, this is different.

653
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,090
It is?

654
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,325
How is this different?

655
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,296
I-- I did something
a while back

656
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:10,067
that really scared her a lot.

657
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,338
Mm, that sounds like it
must have been pretty serious.

658
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,339
It was serious.

659
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,309
Well, do you want
to tell me about it?

660
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,914
I don't think I really want
to talk about it right now.

661
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,121
I hope you know that
you can tell me anything.

662
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,590
And it's never going to change
the way I feel about you.

[somber music]

664
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:44,635
I tried to kill myself.

665
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,339
Why?

666
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,579
To get away from my dad.

667
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,014
What did he do to you?

668
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,322
It started when
I was about six.

669
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:09,092
He used to slap
me with his hand.

670
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,761
That wasn't so bad.

671
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,463
But when that didn't
work, he used to whip me

672
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:19,369
with a belt, a thick,
black, leather belt.

673
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,571
Anything would set him off.

If I-- if I didn't
win a swim meet.

675
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,876
If-- if I didn't bring home
straight A's in my report card.

Oh, Matt.

677
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,612
He would just grin at me.

678
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:36,086
And then he'd snap that
belt. I can still hear it.

679
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:40,290
Did your mother
ever try to stop it?

680
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,793
She'd try.

681
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:48,699
But he'd just slap her
down and keep coming at me.

682
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:49,833
When did it stop?

683
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,034
[scoffs] Stop?

684
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:55,906
It never stopped.

685
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:03,347
There were times when
he beat me so hard,

686
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,715
I thought he was
going to kill me.

687
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,822
That's-- that's why I
decided to kill myself

688
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,024
and save him the trouble.

689
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,492

Well, I don't know, Justin.

Uh, I'll be home
in a day or two.

Yeah, that's good.

see what happens.

Yeah, I am.

MATT TEMPLETON: I don't
want to go back to school.

708

I don't want to be away from
you, not even for a day.

That's sweet, Matt.

You have to go back to school.

You can't lose your scholarship.

I care for you so much.

727
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,497
Stop it, Vivian!

728
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,199
I love you!

729
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,834
I want to be with you.

730
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:11,735
Matt.

731
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,072
Say you love me, too!

732
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,039
It's not that easy.

733
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,407
You told Justin you loved him.

734
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,743
I heard you!

735
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,946
Vivian, I've told you
things that I've never

736
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,015
told anyone before in my life.

737
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,918
You're the first person I've
trusted enough to do that.

738
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,619
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

739
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,654
Of course, it does.

740
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,457
Then why can't you
tell me you love me?

741
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,193
Tell me you love me!

742
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,227
Matt, you're hurting me.

743
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:38,295
Three words, Vivian!

744
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,797
I want to hear them!

745
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,698
I love you.

746
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,934
Again!

747
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:44,835
I love you.

748
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,735
Again!

749
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:46,970
[ominous music]

750
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,971
I love you!

751
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,514
See, was that so hard?

752
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,830
ALEC: You know, I can't believe
you actually showed up today.

753
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,098
Sorry, man.

754
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,566
But it's not like
I've been hiding out.

755
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:19,402
Yeah, well, you
could have fooled me.

756
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,938
MATT TEMPLETON: Alec, have
you ever cared about someone

757
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,774
so much that it hurt?

758
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:28,545
That if you left them
behind, you thought you die?

759
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,847
[scoffs] Once.

760
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,048
Well, then maybe
you'll understand

761
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,049
what's been going on.

762
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,419
I'm in love.

763
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,024
Well, that explains a lot.

764
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,563
You finally did it, didn't you?

765
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,331
You did it, and you
kept it all to yourself.

766
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,602
Well, come on,
Matt, who is she?

767
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,775
Vivian Conrad.

768
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,310
We've been seeing each
other since the beginning

769
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,211
of the summer.

770
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,813
We're-- we're in love.

771
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,949
Oh, man.

772
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,551
You are in way over your head.

773
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,091
KATHERINE TEMPLETON: I didn't
know whether to show them

774
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,427
to you or not.

775
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,695
Matt, get in here!

776
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,397
Charles, he leaves
for school soon.

777
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,600
You let me handle this.

778
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,769
What?

779
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,138
What's going on here?

780
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,473
This is Vivian
Conrad's credit card.

781
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:31,508
I want an answer.

782
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,784
I'm in love with her, mom.

783
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,686
[ominous music]

784
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,421
You can't mean that.

785
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,656
Vivian's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

786
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,391
You must be out of your mind.

787
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:52,295
Matt, she's a grown woman.

788
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,496
She's married.

789
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:54,831
And she has a child.

790
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,399
You haven't even
finished school.

791
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,668
Vivian wants me
to finish school.

792
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,271
She's the only reason
I'm bothering to go back.

793
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:06,142
[sighs] This
just isn't normal.

794
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,080
Oh, sure, like this family
wrote the book on being normal.

795
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,348
Just a minute.

796
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,616
I'm not through with you yet.

797
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,617
Don't you touch me again.

798
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,728
KATHERINE TEMPLETON: [sobs]

799
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,002
VIVIAN CONRAD: Oh, the
cake was so beautiful!

800
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,003
Yeah.

801
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,939
[chatter]

802
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,841
Thank you very much.

803
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,975
Oh, this is just--
[doorbell ringing]

804
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:39,976
--lovely.

805
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:48,652
Matt.

806
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,423
What are you doing here?

807
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,491
We need to talk.

808
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,525
This is not a good time.

809
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,328
Vivian, my parents
found out about us.

810
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,663
I thought we had
an arrangement.

811
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:00,463
How did that happen?

812
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,364
It doesn't matter.

813
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,532
They-- they found out!

814
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,900
Look, you have to leave now.

815
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,302
Vivian, we need to talk.

816
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,803
Viv, who is it?

817
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:07,704
Oh, hello, Matt.

818
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,339
What can we do for you?

819
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,374
Matt just stopped over
to say goodbye on his way

820
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,343
back to college, isn't
that right, Matt?

821
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,981
Yeah, sure, whatever.

822
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,082
Well, good luck.

823
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:20,417
Uh, you're going to
have to excuse us, Matt.

824
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,318
We have company

825
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,453
Right, company.

826
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:24,454
Sorry, Matt.

827
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:28,558
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

828
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,811
[birds chirping]

829
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,761
See you tomorrow, bye.

830
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,651
[electric whirring]

831
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,016

[water splashing]

833
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,025
You are absolutely beautiful.

834
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,862
[gasps] Matt, what
are you doing here?

835
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,232
I wanted to see you before
I went off to college.

836
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,100
I've been trying to call you
for the last couple of days,

837
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,404
but Maggie keeps giving
me the runaround.

838
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,739
How did you get in the house?

839
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,640
No one answered.

840
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,541
I let myself in.

841
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,077
That's OK, isn't it?

842
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,680
No, it's not OK.

843
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,016
Justin and Lauren will
be here in a few minutes.

844
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,185
Well, then we
got a few minutes.

845
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,987
No, don't.

846
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,456
Stop it, Matt.

847
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,791
We could get caught.

848
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,593
You never wanted
me to stop before.

849
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:20,163
[ominous music]

850
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,431

[door closing]

852
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,282
Justin's home.

853
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,251
He's going to kill
me if he finds you.

854
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,252
Hurry, Matt.

855
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,854
Get going, quickly!

856
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,161
My shoes.

857
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,162
What?

858
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,533
- Will you write to me?
- Yes, of course, I will.

859
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,235
- Promise.
- Yes, I promise.

860
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:33,236
Go.

861
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:44,647
Hi!

862
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,982
Oh, hi, sweetie.
LAUREN: Hi, mom.

863
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,116
JUSTIN CONRAD:
Lauren, go change,

864
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,751
and then you can watch
the videos, all right?

865
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,793
I think I'll get dressed now.

866
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:57,794
You do that.

867
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,361
[school bell tolling]

[chatter]

869
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,704
VIVIAN CONRAD (VOICEOVER):
Dear, Matt, as always,

870
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,574
it was great hearing from you.

871
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,075
Why is it that
whenever I'm alone,

872
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,479
my mind goes back
to thoughts of you?

873
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,348
I can almost touch
your smooth skin,

874
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:55,785
see your bright, beautiful
eyes, and feel the way you

875
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,655
used to hold me in your arms.

876
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,223
We both know you
going back to school

877
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,859
was the right thing
to do, but I will

878
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:07,630
always cherish the time we
spent together this past summer.

879
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,365
I hope your classes
are going well.

880
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:10,767
I just know you'll
make the dean's

881
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,869
list again this semester.

882
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,771
I am so proud of you.

883
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,474
And I know you have a
bright future ahead of you.

884
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,376
Write again, soon.

885
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:21,444
I miss you.

886
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,445
Vivian.

01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,818
[door closing]

888
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:29,819
Mom's here.

889
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,390
Isn't that nice!

890
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,227
It's beautiful!

891
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,499
Hi, Maggie.

892
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,467
Where's Mr. Conrad?

893
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,269
He's in your bedroom.

894
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,638
Any messages?

895
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,606
Matt Templeton called.

896
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,776
Three times, mommy.

897
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,777
Three times?

898
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,118
You better get a move on.

899
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,619
We have to be there in an hour.

900
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,821
OK, I won't be long.

901
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,255
I won't be long at all.

902
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,691
Good.

903
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,094
[phone ringing]

904
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,230
I'll get it.

905
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,264
Hello?

906
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,299
Thank god, you're home.

907
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,967
I've been trying to
call you all day.

908
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,635
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): Hi.

909
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,904
Hi, Jackie.

910
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,673
I guess you can't talk.

911
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,008
No, Justin and I are just,
uh, getting ready to go

912
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,276
out for dinner this evening.

913
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,783
Listen, I thought I was always
supposed to call you, remember?

914
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:34,884
I know, I know.

915
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:37,987
I-- I couldn't help it.

916
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,056
I've been getting your
letters, they're great.

917
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,426
I can't wait to see
you over the holidays.

918
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,462
No, actually, this is not a
very good time for me to talk.

919
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:48,464
OK.

920
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,266
I get it.

921
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,901
Well, when would be a good time?

922
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,070
I'd love to talk to you.

923
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,438
Well, thank you for calling.

924
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:56,839
I'll, uh, talk to you soon.

925
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,153
[chatter]

926
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,771
[thunder clap]

927
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:32,308
[phone ringing]

928
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,512
STUDENT: Hey, Tony, telephone!

929
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:37,780
TONY: Oh, I got it, thanks!

930
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,220
[thunder clap]

931
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,741
MATT TEMPLETON
(VOICEOVER): Dear, Vivian,

932
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,511
all I do is think about you.

933
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,814
Just when I think I
can't miss you anymore,

934
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,282
the hurting starts
all over again.

935
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:18,855
I see people everywhere, but
I don't try to make friends.

936
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,957
What's the point?

937
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,459
They're not you.

938
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,261
I'd much rather be
alone in my room

939
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,662
with only my thoughts of us.

940
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:34,303
I still can't believe how lucky
I am you let me into your life.

941
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:38,107
I asked myself a
million times, why me?

942
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,077
I think it's because deep
down you know that no one will

943
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,678
ever love you as much as I do.

944
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,255
[crashing]

945
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,358
LAUREN: [sobs]

946
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,995
Here I am, sweetheart.

947
01:04:59,095 --> 01:04:59,962
[sobs]

948
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,030
Oh!

949
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,065
OK, honey, here
take your foot out.

950
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,467
Come on, come on.

951
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,535
Mommy's going to
make that all better.

952
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,037
Here, here, you lean on me.

953
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,005
Come on now.

954
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:09,906
Lean on me.

955
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,474
OK.

956
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,775
Is it bad?

957
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,312
No, no, nothing a little
antiseptic won't fix.

958
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,480
I'll be right there, sweetie.

959
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,370
[sighs]

960
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:50,980
[ominous music]

961
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,415
MATT TEMPLETON (VOICEOVER):
When I'm missing you,

962
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,750
the most I keep telling myself,
I'll be home before I know it

963
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,286
and that you'll hold
me in your arms again.

964
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:59,221
Remember that I will
always love you.

965
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,156
Matt.

966
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,231
VIVIAN CONRAD: Oh, there.

967
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,500
So it wasn't as bad as
we thought it was, right?

968
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,836
It stings a little
bit, but it's better now.

969
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,237
VIVIAN CONRAD: OK.

970
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,440
Now you go and scoot.

971
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:34,156
You made quite an impression
on Matt Templeton last summer.

972
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,257
What are you talking about?

973
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,028
Care to explain this?

974
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:45,935
Vivian, I want an explanation.

975
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,136
VIVIAN CONRAD: Keep
your voice down.

976
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,704
Lauren can hear
every word you say.

977
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,440
You always get exactly what
you want, don't you, Vivian?

978
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,975
Oh, don't you dare
look at me like I'm

979
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:57,146
the only one in this room
who's ever had an affair.

980
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,583
I never claimed to be
perfect, but even at my worst,

981
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,651
I still used a
little common sense.

982
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:12,561
The boy is only 19 years old.

983
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,065
Dammit, Vivian, this isn't
just a casual affair to him.

984
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,400
He thinks he's in love with you.

985
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,834
What the hell were you thinking!

986
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,736
I was thinking maybe I
was happy for a change.

987
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:21,637
For a change.

988
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:22,872
How could you not be happy?

989
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,874
You have a daughter who
loves you, a beautiful home,

990
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,375
clothes, cars, money, the club.

991
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,110
I have given you everything
you have ever asked for.

992
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,713
You just don't get
it, do you, Justin?

993
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,215
You've given me everything
except what I needed.

994
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,450
Yeah, what's that?

995
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,152
- I needed you.
- Uh.

996
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,386
But you've never
been in this home

997
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,188
long enough to even see it.

998
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,790
So your way of
getting back at me

999
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,892
is to have an affair
with Matt Templeton?

1000
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,628
No, I was not
getting back at you.

1001
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:49,432
I was merely trying to keep
myself from being so alone!

1002
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:00,943
You don't know the
meaning of the word

1003
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,579
alone till you have
to live in this house

1004
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,147
without your husband
or your daughter

1005
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,083
because that's exactly what's
going to happen if you don't

1006
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,250
cut this thing off with Matt.

1007
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,719
I will see to it that
you lose everything,

1008
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,123
me, Lauren, everything.

1009
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,258
Do I make myself
perfectly clear?

1010
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,829
Do I!

1011
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,601
Call Matt.

1012
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:26,535
I think you know the number.

1013
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,072
[ominous music]

1014
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,947

[knocking]

1016
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:47,990
What is it?

1017
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,059
STUDENT: Phone call, Templeton.

1018
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,026
Who is it?

1019
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,895
STUDENT: Some
woman named Vivian.

1020
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:56,365
[ominous music]

1021
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,739
Hi, I can't
believe you called.

1022
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,575
Matt, I have
something to say to you.

1023
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:09,812
It's important that you
listen very closely.

1024
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,281
What are you talking about?

1025
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,817
It's over, Matt.

1026
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,086
You can't possibly
mean that, Vivian.

1027
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,854
Justin found one
of your letters.

1028
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,156
He knows everything.

1029
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,458
I don't give a damn if your
husband found out or not!

1030
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,859
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON
PHONE): I'm sorry, Matt.

1031
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,461
It's over.

1032
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,296
But you told me you love me!

1033
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:28,898
VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE):
I have to hang up now.

1034
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:29,899
No, don't.

1035
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,934
Please, don't--
Vivian, don't hang up!

1036
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,275
[ominous music]

1037
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:51,654
CHARLES CONRAD
(ON PHONE): Hello?

1038
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:52,655
Hello!

1039
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,508
[tires screeching]

1040
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:22,017
[doorbell ringing]

1041
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,286
JUSTIN CONRAD: [sighs]
What the hell do you want?

1042
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,487
Where's Vivian?

1043
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,456
JUSTIN CONRAD: Mrs.
Conrad is upstairs asleep.

1044
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,424
I need to talk to Vivian.

1045
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,525
JUSTIN CONRAD:
That's not possible.

1046
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,793
You're no longer
welcome in our home.

1047
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,161
Vivian!

1048
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,062
Vivian!

1049
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,564
Would you shut up!

1050
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,066
Now are you going to
leave on your own, Matt,

1051
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,267
or do I have to call the police?

1052
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:50,479
Yes, I'd like to report an
intruder, 903 Braxton Way.

1053
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,480
Thank you.

1054
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,285
The police are on their way.

1055
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,586
Do you care to wait in the den?

1056
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,479
Are you proud of yourself?

1057
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:24,780
LAUREN: Mom?

1058
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,748
What's wrong?

1059
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,586
Nothing, sweetheart.

1060
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,288
Daddy just thought
he heard something.

1061
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,322
You go back to bed.

1062
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,218
[shouting, screaming]

1063
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:04,987
KATHERINE TEMPLETON: No, don't!

1064
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,455
JUSTIN CONRAD: [shouts]

1065
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,891
KATHERINE TEMPLETON: [screams]

1066
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,925
Get away from her!

1067
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:10,826
You hear me?

1068
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:11,794
Leave her alone!

1069
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:12,928
KATHERINE TEMPLETON:
No, Matt, no!

1070
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:13,862
Please?

1071
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:14,763
No!

1072
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,131
Matt!

1073
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,933
Don't!

1074
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,568
No!

1075
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,403
No!

1076
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,771
[groans]

1077
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,306
Where's your belt now, Dad?

1078
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,607
Matt, stop it!

1079
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,775
You've got two choices.

1080
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,744
You can pack your bags
and get out of our lives,

1081
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,613
or I can finish
you off right now!

1082
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:32,614
Which is too going to be?

1083
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:22,731
I was only trying to
do the right thing, Matt.

1084
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,600
I know.

1085
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,001
I know.

1086
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:30,139
What on Earth brought
you home from school?

1087
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,373
Let's get you some
sleep, and we'll

1088
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,574
talk about it in the morning.

1089
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,051
[chatter]

1090
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:51,727
Ma'am.

1091
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:00,736
Matt's back!

1092
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,213
Son of a bitch.

1093
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,750
Justin, please, let it go.

1094
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,424
Hello.

1095
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:23,425
Hello.

1096
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,497
[chuckling]

1097
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:29,465
No, she's said it.

1098
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,365
I promise you.

1099
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,667
[chuckles] Yeah.

1100
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:32,701
Oh, OK.

1101
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,069
I've got to go, though.

1102
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,038
Lauren and Justin are going
to be looking all over for me.

1103
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,105
Bye, girls.

1104
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,106
Bye.

1105
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,077
I'm not so sure that
you should be here.

1106
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:42,978
It's OK.

1107
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,513
I just got my old job back.

1108
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,381
Well, that's not going
to change anything.

1109
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,150
I still can't see you anymore.

1110
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,952
Not now, but it will.

1111
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,453
I know Justin made
you say those things.

1112
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,387
And he was right.

1113
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,890
I love you, Vivian.

1114
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,492
And I'm-- I'm willing
to wait for you,

1115
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,727
no matter how long it takes.

1116
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,363
I'm here to take you back.

1117
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,232
Look, it's over Matt.

1118
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,501
Nothing can change that.

1119
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,401
Vivian?

1120
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,669
You'll find somebody else.

1121
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,671
You'll find someone
who is right for you.

1122
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:11,440
Vivian, I don't
want anybody else.

1123
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,408
I want you.

1124
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,077
You can't have me.

1125
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,712
You can't!

1126
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:20,682
You're tearing yourself up over
something that can never be.

1127
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,752
Look at me.

1128
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,754
You have got to let this go.

1129
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,589
[somber music]

1130
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,926
Do you understand?

1131
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,929
We have hurt enough
people already.

1132
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,707
So next week same time.

1133
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:47,743
No.

1134
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:48,644
[chuckles]

1135
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,546
Oh, I understand.

1136
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,047
You'll take care of it?
Good.

1137
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:53,448
[ominous music]
- Thanks, Brent.

1138
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,850
Don't worry, Mr.
Conrad, leave it to me.

1139
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,619
You're the best.

1140
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,122
Sure.

1141
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,292

[phone ringing]

1143
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,413
Brent from the
club is on the phone.

[buzzing]

1145
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:50,706
Vivian!

[lounge music]

1149
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,267
Where was Lauren off to
in such a hurry tonight?

1150
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,903
Oh, the Hendersons
for a slumber party.

1151
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:23,238
She was very excited.

1152
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,307
[chuckles]

1153
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,708
MATT TEMPLETON: Let go of me!

1154
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,610
I have to speak to Mr. Conrad.

1155
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,446
Get off me.

1156
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:32,881
I'm very sorry, Mr. Conrad.

1157
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,116
JUSTIN CONRAD: It's
all right, Henry.

1158
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,350
I'll take care of this.

1159
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,353
Matt, why don't you grab
a chair and join us, hm?

1160
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:39,254
That'll be all.

1161
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:40,255
Yes, sir.

1162
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,927
What seems to be the problem?

1163
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,029
You are the problem.

1164
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:51,066
You just decided I
can't have a job here.

1165
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,768
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1166
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:53,735
You liar!

1167
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,303
Matt, calm down.

1168
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,039
He had me fired, Vivian!

1169
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,573
That job was the only
thing I had left.

1170
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,675
JUSTIN CONRAD: I
don't think this

1171
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,209
is the time or the
place to be discussing

1172
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,611
your employment problems, Matt.

1173
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,347
My problems are your
problems, Mr. Conrad.

1174
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,383
You should know that by now.

1175
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:10,452
You have to tell him, Vivian.

1176
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,088
You have to tell him everything.

1177
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,456
Tell him what, Matt?

1178
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,860
- Take Mr. Templeton outside.
- Yes, sir.

1179
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,928
Come on.

1180
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,597
It's time everyone
knows the truth, Vivian!

1181
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:23,498
SECURITY: Go on.

1182
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:24,900
That's it.
Come on.

1183
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,034
MATT TEMPLETON: Let go of me!

1184
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,469
SECURITY: Come on, now.
MATT TEMPLETON: Vivian!

1185
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,370
SECURITY: Relax.

[lounge music]

1187
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,621
VIVIAN CONRAD: Dear,
Matt, alone again

1188
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,057
with only my thoughts of you.

1189
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,093
I can almost taste your
lips touching mine,

1190
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,294
and it triggers my
craving for you.

1191
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,228
[ominous music]

1192
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,063
What starts out
as soft and gentle

1193
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:58,066
soon bursts into
full-blown passion.

1194
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:01,136
I can feel your hands move along
my body, and my need for you

1195
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:04,072
grows until it's
almost unbearable.

1196
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,174
Oh, I miss you so very much.

1197
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:20,956
Oh!

1198
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:21,823
Morning.

1199
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,125
Hi, Vivian.

1200
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,294
[whispering]

1201
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:27,195
Morning.

1202
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,563
Hi, Mrs. Conrad.

1203
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,771
[giggling]

1204
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:36,772
Good morning.

1205
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,090
That bastard!

1206
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:04,533
[bar music]

1207
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,734
You did what?

1208
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,603
I copied the letter she
sent me, the one about how

1209
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,272
I made love to her,
about how she missed

1210
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,706
being with me, everything.

1211
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,074
Tell me you're
making this up, man.

1212
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:13,975
You are making this up.

1213
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,944
No, I really did it.

1214
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,245
Excuse me.

1215
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,314
[chatter]

1216
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,516
I plastered it everywhere.

1217
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,952
I plastered it all
over the club, all

1218
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,954
over their neighborhood,
everywhere.

1219
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,222
What did you do that for?

1220
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,858
Because the Conrads run
around telling lies about me.

1221
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,026
That's why.

1222
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,128
I can't let them get
away with that, Alec.

1223
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:36,198
I want everyone to know the
truth about me and Vivian.

1224
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:37,766
The truth about
you and Vivian.

1225
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,634
The truth is she used you.

1226
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,436
She used you, and
she dumped you.

1227
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:42,337
You don't understand.

1228
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:43,405
We loved each other.

1229
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,273
Matt, it had nothing
to do with love.

1230
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,274
Damn it, Alec!

1231
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:47,642
Matt, I know what
I'm talking about.

1232
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:48,543
No, you don't!

1233
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:51,079
No one understands.

1234
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,747
Matt, I do understand.

1235
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,322
Did she give you a shirt, too?

[ominous music]

1237
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:06,394
I thought so.

1238
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,800
Matt, I hate to
break this to you,

1239
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,435
but she does this every summer.

1240
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:17,772
Last summer, it was me.

1241
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:21,409
[scoffs] Don't worry, man.

1242
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,310
You'll get over it.

1243
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,311
I did.

1244
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:41,296
[doorbell ringing]

1245
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,001
Yes.

1246
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,236
I'm here to see
Matt Templeton.

1247
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:50,071
Just a minute.

1248
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:51,072
Matt?

1249
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:55,477
Someone to see you.

1250
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,616
Matt Templeton?

1251
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:02,817
Yeah?

1252
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,052
As an officer
of the court, I've

1253
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,454
been instructed to deliver
this into your hands.

1254
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,589
Here.

1255
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,157
What is this?

1256
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,059
If you have any questions,
just call the number

1257
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,227
at the bottom of the document.

1258
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,228
Good day, sir.

1259
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:24,606
Come on.

1260
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:25,707
Good.

1261
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,343
This is 2 for 2 and 3 for 3!

1262
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:29,411
Do right hand.

1263
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,578
OK, right hand?

1264
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:33,515
[groans] Time out, time out.

1265
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:34,749
Change of player.

1266
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,151
[chuckles]

1267
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,052
Go on.

1268
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:37,953
Go on.

1269
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:39,020
OK.

1270
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,623
See you in a minute.

1271
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:42,857
Are you ready for this?

1272
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:49,364
Oh, sorry.

1273
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,334
[tires screeching]

1274
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,102
Lauren, go inside.

1275
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:54,970
LAUREN: Oh, Mom.

1276
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,771
No, go inside now, Lauren.

1277
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:58,740
Tell Daddy that I need
him out here right away.

1278
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,352
You must want to go to jail.

1279
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,220
What do you mean?

1280
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,588
Weren't you served
with restraining

1281
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,256
papers this morning?

1282
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,592
Oh, yeah.

1283
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:18,493
Big deal.

1284
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,262
Yes, it is a very big deal.

1285
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:24,232
You're not allowed
to be here legally.

1286
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,434
If you don't leave,
I'll have you arrested.

1287
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,936
I should have you
arrested anyway.

1288
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:28,937
For what?

1289
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:36,878
For making some sick,
public joke of my letters.

1290
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,213
How could you do that?

1291
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:41,149
Alec told me everything.

1292
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:44,319
[ominous music]

1293
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:45,353
Justin!

1294
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,621
Save your breath, Vivian.

1295
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,957
Justin can't get
you out of this one.

1296
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:52,093
Everything's a game to
you, isn't it, Vivian!

1297
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,661
I loved you!

1298
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,196
I trusted you!

1299
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,564
You never cared about me!

1300
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,266
You only care about yourself!

1301
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,035
You're just like everyone else!

1302
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:10,712
[ominous music]

1303
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:42,277
[knocking]

1304
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:43,978
MATT TEMPLETON:
Uh, come in, Mom.

1305
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:44,913
What's the matter?

1306
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,948
I thought you had
a job interview.

1307
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:48,316
I didn't go.

1308
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,885
Oh, Matt, why not?

1309
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:53,121
Uh, I had some
stuff on my mind.

1310
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,528
It still hurts, doesn't it?

1311
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:01,529
Yeah.

1312
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,736
I really loved her, Mom.

1313
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:10,472
But after what
she did to me, I--

1314
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,641
I hate her, too.

1315
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,009
I don't know.

1316
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,179
I can't tell the difference
between love and hate anymore.

1317
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,315
They both just feel
the same to me.

1318
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,321
You can't hide in
your room forever.

1319
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,691
That won't make your
problems with Vivian go away.

1320
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,059
Sooner or later,
you're going to have

1321
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:34,529
to come out and face the world.

1322
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,565
Tell you what, why don't
you put on a fresh shirt

1323
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,834
and go see if you can
still have that interview?

1324
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,375
Yeah, anything you say, Mom.

1325
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:57,152
Matt, everything's
going to be just fine.

1326
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:10,298
[chatter]

1327
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:15,737
[laughter]

1328
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:17,405
I'm sorry.

1329
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,113
What a shot.

1330
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,814
I got lucky, again.

1331
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,055
He's here again.

1332
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:39,594
It's all right.

1333
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,564
I can handle it.

1334
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,033
Are you sure?

1335
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:46,201
I'm sure.

1336
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,902
Look, would you ask
Justin to check on Lauren?

1337
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:15,196
What is it now, Matt?

1338
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:16,798
I just wanted you to
know that I'm sorry I

1339
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,166
ever even met you, Vivian.

1340
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:28,343
[ominous music]

1341
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,778
Vivian!

1342
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,747
[gunshot]

1343
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:34,682
Vivian!

1344
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:38,219
[gunshots]

1345
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:50,665
MAN: Somebody call an ambulance!

1346
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:51,666
Help!

1347
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,138
Somebody call
an ambulance, now!

1348
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:41,716
[door closing]

1349
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,065
Hi, honey.

1350
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,333
How did the interview go?

1351
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:43,144
[ominous music]

1352
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,823
[knocking]

1353
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,793
Matt, what's wrong?

1354
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:06,300
Matt, what's the matter?

1355
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,837
[sirens wailing]

1356
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,219
Come on, give us
some backup here.

1357
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,655
[radio chatter]

1358
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:28,556
There he is!

1359
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:29,690
There he is!

1360
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,192
No!

1361
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:32,360
Get her out of here now!

1362
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:38,966
You have the right
to remain silent.

1363
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,568
If you give up this
right, anything you say

1364
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:41,669
can and will be
used against you.

1365
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,670
MATT TEMPLETON
(VOICEOVER): Vivian

1366
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,471
looked me right in
the eye an instant

1367
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:46,374
before I pulled the trigger.

1368
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:49,944
It was as though she knew what
was going to happen and why.

1369
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:50,845
KATHERINE TEMPLETON: No!

1370
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:51,979
No!

1371
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:53,848
Matt!

1372
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:56,317
I love you, Matt.

[radio chatter]

1374
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:03,157
MATT TEMPLETON (VOICEOVER):
Vivian meant everything to me,

1375
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:07,462
but nobody understood
that, not even her.

1376
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,564
Maybe now, they'll
all understand.

1377
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:11,766
[somber music]

1378
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:22,009
KATHERINE TEMPLETON: [sobs] No!
