(birds chirping)

13
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,083
- Hey, Jeff, what's up?

14
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:57,588
- Hi, Steve.

15
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,125
Bogglins.

16
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:01,568
- Hey little faggots,

17
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:05,328
what is this, some sort
of girly slumber party?

18
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,631
- What's up, Sculley?

19
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,366
- [Sculley] Fuck you too.

20
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:10,727
- [Steve] Did you find a job?

21
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,861
- Yeah, me and your fuckin' mom

22
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,239
are washing windshields
on the turnpike.

23
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:16,740
- Funny.

24
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,544
- Hey, what'd you fuckin'
eat my Droogies for?

25
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:20,978
- They're my Droogies!

26
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,913
- Oh, yeah, they're
your Droogies?

27
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:23,781
- [Jeff] Yeah.

28
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,715
- Well, here you go.

29
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,984
Enjoy your fuckin'
Droogies, man.

30
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,284
- Why are you such an asshole?

31
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:33,289
- Because I like to take
after you (chuckles).

32
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:33,750
- Don't quit your day job.

33
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,251
- Why don't you faggots get
on your way out to school,

34
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,527
and go learn the golden rule.

35
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,795
- I'm not a faggot!

36
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:38,629
- You are too a faggot.

37
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,590
You've always been a faggot
and you'll always be a faggot.

38
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,999
- Shut the fuck up!

39
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,126
Drink up and let's
get outta here.

40
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,469
- Yeah, why don't you
get outta here, man.

41
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,303
- Let's go, Steve.

42
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:53,744
- Oh, I'm really fuckin'
hurt by your actions, look.

43
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,178
- [Steve] Have fun.

44
00:04:54,228 --> 00:05:02,228
- I feel like I just
made out with you.

45
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,493
Mom?

46
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,130
You bitch!

47
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:21,180
(birds chirping)

48
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:31,624
(students chattering)

49
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,339
- This is Principal
Kaplan speaking.

50
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,977
I have a few announcements to
make before you leave today,

51
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,580
and I want everyone to
pay close attention.

52
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,281
I mean it now.

53
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,583
These are important
announcements, you know.

54
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,419
All right now, I'm sure you
all wanna hear the results

55
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,388
of last week's Battle
of the Bands contest

56
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,224
to decide which
group will preform

57
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,227
this Saturday night
at the school dance.

58
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,699
Though I question your taste
in music, it's your decision.

59
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:25,468
So, the winner is
Blood Sucking Ghouls.

60
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,206
Blood Sucking Ghouls?

61
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,000
They will be performing at
the dance tomorrow night.

62
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,408
It will begin at 7:30,

63
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,312
and everyone is
encouraged to attend,

64
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,347
and no drinking, I'll be there!

65
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,350
If I catch anyone drinking
or smoking any pots,

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,686
they will be
expelled on the spot.

67
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,523
So, everyone better be
on their best behavior.

68
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,224
(clears throat)

69
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:53,130
Now that we're on the
topic of good behavior.

70
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:01,180
(light rock music)

71
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,651
Now, there will be
basketball practice

72
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,519
in the gym this afternoon.

73
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,713
- Jesus, when is
this fuckin' jerk off

74
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,688
gonna shut up already?

75
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,422
I always hated the shithead.

76
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,291
- Relax, it'll be
a few minutes tops.

77
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,493
We'll slip in when the little
pukes start coming out.

78
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:28,398
- The little bastards,
I'd like to kill them all.

79
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,666
- I'll keep the gun for now.

80
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:35,873
We don't need to attract
any fuckin' attention.

81
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,233
You're sure the shit's
in there, right?

82
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,075
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

83
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,069
I mean, unless that fuckin'
shithead janitor's moved it.

84
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,246
It should be in
the wall somewhere.

85
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:48,552
- Cool, how come you never
graduated this shit hole?

86
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:48,986
- Fuckin' jerk off principal

87
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,188
that's jerkin' us off
over the loudspeaker,

88
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,490
he screwed me over.

89
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,728
I'd like to rip his
fuckin' face off.

90
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,422
- Fuck him, after we
take down the janitor,

91
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,765
you'll have enough money
to buy the fuckin' diploma.

92
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:07,470
- (chuckles) Yeah, it'll be
easy to steal as this bike, huh?

93
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,299
- I think we could all
learn a valuable lesson

94
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,910
from Mr. Franklin's
own life experiences.

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,960
That's all I have for today.

96
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,621
Well, that went well.

97
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,323
- I think they got the point.

98
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,090
- I hope so.

99
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,325
- I wouldn't worry about it.

100
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:34,097
- All right, I'll
be in my office.

101
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:42,147

119
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,884
Hold on a minute.

120
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:08,819
Principal Kaplan.

121
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:09,820
- Oh, very good.

122
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,487
How are you?

123
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:11,722
Joe Franklin speaking.

124
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,858
- Hello, Joe, Bob Kaplan here.

125
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,119
Listen, I just
wanted to thank you

126
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,262
for speaking at the school
assembly this morning.

127
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,097
- Ah, don't mention it.

128
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,231
It was my pleasure, Bob.

129
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,281
They were great kids.

130
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,334
Beautiful kids,
every one of them.

131
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,302
Great, great kids.

132
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,403
Ah, God bless them all.

133
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,338
They are such nice
people, I mean it.

134
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,465
Listen, Bob, but more important,

00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,035
and work out the
details for the next uh,

00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,012
for the next appearance,
for the next speech?

138
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,079
- How about Monday?

139
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,115
- Ah, no, Monday's
not a good day for me,

140
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:41,752
because uh, no Monday I've

00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,746
I've got an appointment

142
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,055
I don't wanna
disappoint Zsa Zsa.

143
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,056
I can't make it Monday.

144
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,724
- Well, how about

145
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,852
- Well, my only problem,
not, not that it's a problem,

146
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,663
but I gotta go to the
Club Med on Saturday.

147
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,531
Yeah, I promised,

Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm considering

00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,216
- [Jackie] Excuse me.

157
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,151
(knocking on door)

158
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:14,918
Joe, Joe?

159
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,312

00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:19,573
I'm sorry, okay bye, Bob.

00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,422
I have great jokes and not
too dirty, not too dirty.

169
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,532
I mean I have a reputation.

170
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,331
I tell dirty jokes.

171
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,693
- I, I, I've heard that
reputation, yeah, yeah.

172
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:30,893
- Did ya, I, I work
all over the place.

173
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,604
I have a joke line,
9-2-2-y-5-1-6, you've called it.

174
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:34,271
- Many times.

175
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,205
- The jokes aren't too dirty.

176
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,265
Well, they're a little dirty,

177
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,601
but they don't have
dirty words in them.

178
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,968
A little girl walks
out of the bathroom...

179
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,704
- Have you, have you seen
my show through the years?

180
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:42,345
- Oh yeah, I watch
it every night.

181
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,213
Is it still on?

182
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,184
- Yeah, I was on last
night, I was on last night.

183
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,083
- No, listen, I'm kidding.

184
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:46,883
Of course I watch it,

185
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,553
and I have jokes that are good

186
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,555
without the four letter words.

187
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,488
- There are such things?

188
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,815
- Yeah, a girl walks
out of the bathroom.

189
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,024
Her mother's making a cake.

190
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,493
She says, Mommy,
can I lick the bowl?

191
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:57,327
And her mother says,

192
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:01,064
why don't you just flush it
like everybody else (laughing).

193
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:01,865
You know when you know
you're really lonely?

194
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:02,466
- When?

195
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,360
- You're own tongue starts
to feel good in your mouth.

196
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,135
(both laugh)

197
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,663
- That's good, that's the
kind of a joke, no wait.

198
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,164
- Well, that's not dirty,
there's no four letter...

199
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,298
- That's the kind
of a joke, Jackie,

200
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,734
that can not only close
theaters, it'll close cities.

201
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,075
- (laughs) Wait,
uh, what's that?

202
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,410
- I'm only kidding, I give up.

203
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,244
- That's a dead Italian,

204
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:19,550
because if he was alive, he'd
be going like that (laughs).

205
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,350
Ask me how fat she was.

206
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,351
- How fat she was?

207
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,554
- No, say, how fat was she?

208
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,454
- How fat was she?

209
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:28,593
- She was so fat that when
she forgot her diaphragm,

210
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,761
they used a hubcap.

211
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,295
- That is good, right, right.

212
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,598
- A guy's in bed with a girl,

213
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,832
he says, you're flat
and you're tight.

214
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:40,771
She says, get off
my back (laughs).

215
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,331
- You think that's good
for a family type show.

216
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,073
I think so, right?

217
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,040
- I think it could work.

218
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,709
- I think it is.

219
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,676
- A couple's in the living room,

220
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:46,611
he says, you're dry tonight.

221
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:51,214
She says, you're licking
the rug (laughs).

222
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,809
What do you say to a girl
with no arms and no legs?

223
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,584
- I give up.

224
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:54,251
- Nice tits.

225
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,945
I've been a fan of
yours ever since I heard

226
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,180
that I was auditioning
for you (laughs).

227
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,447
- A week from Saturday
we definitely tape.

228
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,490
You're on the panel
with a couple of kids

229
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,627
named Milton Berle and
Henny Youngman, all right?

230
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:05,061
We'll do the changing face
of comedy, how's that?

231
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,189
- They're gonna steal my jokes.

232
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,099
How are a woman's breasts
like electric train sets?

233
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:09,767
- I give up.

234
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,027
- They're originally
intended for the kids,

235
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,563
but Pop always ends
up playing with them.

236
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:16,940
What do a bleach blond
and a 747 have in common?

237
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,575
- Uh.

238
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,911
- They both got a
black box (laughs).

239
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:21,278
I'm pretty good, pretty good.

240
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,480
Did you hear about the
guy who couldn't come?

241
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,447
We had to go get him (laughs).

242
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,817
- Listen, speaking,
speaking about coming,

243
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,818
I wanna thank you...

244
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:28,485
- You know how.

245
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:29,419
- I wanna thank you for coming.

246
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,353
- Just, just one more.

247
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,087
- All right.

248
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,315
- You know your boss
is like a diaper?

249
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:32,889
- How?

250
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,791
- He's always on your ass,

251
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:35,084
and he's usually full
of shit (laughs).

252
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,285
- Listen, all right,
one more, one more,

253
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,987
then I'll uh, then I'll
give you my, my uh,

254
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,964
informed appraisal, my
educated assessment.

255
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:41,799
- They'd be going nuts.

256
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:42,992
I can hear 'em,
listen, I can hear 'em.

257
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:43,934
- Listen, Jackie, Jackie,

258
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,703
I wanna, I wanna
tell you something.

259
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:46,637
I wanna tell you something.

260
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,773
That your future is secure.

261
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:49,472
- Yeah?

262
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,667
- Yes, but don't
quit your day job.

263
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:51,542
- I got a few more here.

264
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,277
- You will go overnight from
obscurity to total oblivion.

265
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:54,978
- Where.

266
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:55,680
- One, one more.

267
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,340
- Where would you find
a turtle with no legs?

268
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,114
- I give up.

269
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,408
- Right where you
left him (laughs).

270
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,677
- (chuckles) Have a good,
have a good evening.

271
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:01,712
- It's because he couldn't get,

272
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:02,813
because he couldn't
get anywhere.

273
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:04,146
- You are the greatest,
you're the greatest.

274
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,448
- You know why you should
never drink diet soda

275
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,356
while you're having oral sex?

276
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:06,990
- Why?

277
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,150
- Because then you
have two aftertastes

278
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,660
you gotta get rid of (laughs).

279
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,754
- [Joe] Have fun, have fun.

280
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:11,921
- Joe, I've got
millions of these.

281
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,923
I'll call you with some more
if you want me to call you.

282
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:14,632
- Promise, please.

283
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:15,759
- [Jackie] I can call you back,

284
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,260
because I know I've got
lots of great stuff here.

285
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,001
I wanna do you show.

286
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,236
- [Secretary] Carol Nestling.

287
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:19,870
- Hello?

288
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,972
- [Janitor] No, no,
what're you doing?

289
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,242
(screams) Help me!

290
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:30,615
(gun firing)

291
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:31,682
- Yell all you want!

292
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,050
No one's gonna
hear you down here!

293
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,153
Now, tell me where it
is while you still can!

294
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,154
- Yeah, tell him where it is

295
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,625
before we blow your
fuckin' brains out

296
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:43,026
- Fuck you!

297
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:46,229
- Fuck this, are
you sure it's here?

298
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,163
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

299
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,465
It's in the wall somewhere.

300
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:51,167
He's had that here for
years, the bastard.

301
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:59,217
- Watch him, I'll
find it myself!

302
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,085
(janitor screams)

303
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:16,026
- You find it?

304
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:21,632
- I can't see a fuckin' thing.

305
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:26,269
Wait a minute.

306
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,905
(janitor screams)

307
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:35,955
- Where the fuck is it?

308
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:44,129
(gun firing)

309
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:55,007
(suspenseful music)

310
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,334
I can't see a fuckin' thing.

311
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:04,575
- Cool out.

312
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,244
What the fuck?

313
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,046
- What is this place?

314
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:17,922
- Beats the shit outta me.

315
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:19,957
- Hey, what do these do?

316
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:20,624
- No!

317
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:25,095
(suspenseful music)

318
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,397
Shit.

319
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:35,447
(suspenseful music)

320
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:47,994
(thugs choking and coughing)

321
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:06,512
(suspenseful music)

322
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:36,334
(hard rock music)

323
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,937
- Come on, man, do you
got the tape or not?

324
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,171
- Relax, I got it.

325
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,473
Crazy Tommy told me
it was awesome too.

326
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:27,177
- Now, all you have to do
is find the God damn thing.

327
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,012
- So, is your old man

328
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:30,748
getting you a gun for
your birthday or what?

329
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:32,215
- I don't know.

330
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,316
Shit, he must be.

331
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,611
We've been going
to the firing range

332
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,922
every weekend for
two months now.

333
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:42,960
I'm getting pretty good.

334
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,262
What the fuck, man, where is it?

335
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,397
- It's movie time.

336
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,134
- Cool, let's go
up to the AV room.

337
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,735
I wanna see some good gore.

338
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,538
- The AV room?

339
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,438
Are you sure?

340
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,807
We could get busted.

341
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:57,942
If Kaplan catches us.

342
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,044
- That old bastard
won't catch us.

343
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:00,945
Don't worry about it.

344
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:03,614
Besides, have I ever
gotten us busted?

345
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:04,682
- [Jeff] No.

346
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:05,248
- Bolt.

347
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,152
- Okay, but I hope we
don't get in trouble.

348
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:15,258
- Trust me.

349
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,308
- I love you.

350
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,195
- [Mike] Yeah, me too, babe.

351
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,097
- Do you want your
history notebook?

352
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:23,499
- [Mike] No, I don't need it.

353
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,868
- What're we gonna do tonight?

354
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:27,470
- Well, I thought we'd
go over Danny's later.

355
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,707
- [Mary] Danny's again?

356
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:30,340
- Yeah.

357
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,735
- Well, I thought we'd spend
some time alone tonight,

358
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,836
and not go out with the guys.

359
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,979
- We are gonna spend
some time alone together.

360
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,681
- When?

361
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,048
- Right now.

362
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,098
- Oh, Mike, not here.

363
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:47,133
- Come on.

364
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,036
(boy whistling)

365
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:07,086
(suspenseful music)

366
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:18,330
(thugs coughing and groaning)

367
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,387
- What the fuck happened?

368
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,022
- I don't know.

369
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,192
You pressed the fuckin' button.

370
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,627
- I don't feel so good.

371
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,529
I gotta go to the hospital.

372
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,734
- What the fuck are we
gonna tell them, huh?

373
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:44,784
Let's get the fuck outta
here before the cops come.

374
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,853
- He's getting his
time down real good.

375
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,387
- He certainly is.

376
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,156
We should do really
well tonight.

377
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:02,425
- Well, we're going to
do better than just well.

378
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,228
We're gonna kick their butts.

379
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,599
- (laughs) You better not let
them hear you talk like that.

380
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:11,135
They might actually
think we're human.

381
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,537
(swim coaches laughing)

382
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:21,587
(swim team growling)

383
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,854
- Oh, my God!

384
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:31,722
- I think they're putting

385
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:35,726
a little bit too much
chlorine in the pool.

386
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:39,029
(suspenseful music)

387
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,464
(swim coaches screaming)

388
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:49,515
- Let me up, no!

389
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,607
(female coach screaming)

390
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:58,348
(suspenseful music)

391
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,518
(male coach screaming)

392
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:05,055
(suspenseful music)

393
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:08,125
(female coach screaming)

394
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:16,175
(suspenseful music)

395
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:27,945
(Blade screaming)

396
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:35,995
(hard rock music)

397
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:24,301
- [Blade] One,
two, three, hit it!

398
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:32,351
(hard rock music)

399
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:34,438
(audience cheering
and applauding)

400
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,841
- Yeah!

401
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,977
That was
fan-fuckin'-tastic, man.

402
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,871
We're gonna play our fuckin'
brains out tomorrow night.

403
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:43,614
- Fuckin' aright, man.

404
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,615
Listen, we'll take a break.

405
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,817
We'll come back and practice
to close the set, okay?

406
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,085
- What's wrong with Roxanne?

407
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,086
- Nothing, everything's good.

408
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:54,157
It's cool, really, really.

409
00:27:54,207 --> 00:28:02,207
(light piano music)

410
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,570
What the fuck is wrong with you?

411
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,337
- What the fuck
are we doin' here?

412
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:08,839
- What do you mean?

413
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:10,407
- This place,
that's what I mean.

414
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:11,274
- It's a great gig.

415
00:28:11,324 --> 00:28:12,843
The kids will love us.

416
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:13,903
- I thought all the hard work

417
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,338
was so that we could
play bigger places,

418
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:16,880
not fuckin' high schools.

419
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,609
- Listen Rox, I've been
doin' this for awhile,

420
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,585
and these so-called
fuckin' high schools

421
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:21,785
is where it all starts.

422
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,413
Besides, these kids,
if they really like us,

423
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:24,447
and really get into our music,

424
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:25,649
we'll have the whole
graduating class

425
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:29,326
full of Blood Sucking Ghoul
fans in just a few months.

426
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,093
- Well, I hope so,

427
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,155
because we're definitely not
making any money on this deal.

428
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,131
- Don't worry about it, Roxanne.

429
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,132
- Listen, Blade,
you know I think

430
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:38,636
you're the best God damn
lead singer in New York,

431
00:28:38,686 --> 00:28:40,704
but we've gotta make a change.

432
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:41,972
- What kind of change?

433
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:47,077
- I think I should
start managing the band.

434
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:48,646
Don't give me that look.

435
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:49,739
We've talked about this before,

436
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:53,316
and you know it's
the best thing.

437
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:53,750
You have a big heart,

438
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,452
but you don't have
a head for business

439
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,187
and strategy and I do.

440
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,482
- Yeah, and what're
the guys gonna think

441
00:28:58,506 --> 00:28:59,923
when I tell them all this?

442
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:01,150
- They'll be thanking
you when you start

443
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:03,927
playing big clubs and
get a record contract.

444
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:07,665
- Oh, and you think
you can do all that?

445
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:08,799
- Yeah, I think I can.

446
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,602
I'm pretty tough
when I have to be.

447
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:16,440
- Let me think about it, and
I'll tell you in the morning.

448
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:24,490
- Okay, you fucker, think hard.

449
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,850
- Don't get me started,
don't get me started.

450
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,784
Hold that thought though.

451
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:31,054
Everybody up, let's go,
let's practice the next set.

452
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:39,104
(light piano music)

453
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,070
- [Jeff] That's
fuckin' beautiful!

454
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,371
- [Steve] This is great!

455
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:52,242
- I told you crazy Tony
really knows his gore.

456
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,210
- [Steve] How did he get this?

457
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,846
It's not even out yet.

458
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,280
- It's a bootleg.

459
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:03,019
- [Steve] I gotta get a copy.

460
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,790
- [Both] Oh, shit!

461
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,627
- Look at that.

462
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:12,929
I didn't know that was
physically possible.

463
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,999
- They're dead remember?

464
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:24,049
(zombies groaning)

465
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,649
- Did you hear something?

466
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,752
- What?

467
00:30:34,802 --> 00:30:39,356
- Nothing, I guess.

468
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:47,406
(hard rock music)

469
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,045
(whistle blowing)

470
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,648
- Okay, listen up.

471
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:05,041
Before we get started
with the layup drills,

472
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:07,150
I have something to
say to you girls.

473
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,277
Your performance Monday night

474
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,187
against Aquinas
High was pathetic.

475
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,314
You should've
kicked their butts.

476
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,448
You're better than they are.

477
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:13,990
We are never gonna
make to the states

478
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,526
playing the way
we did on Monday.

479
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,493
To tell you the truth,

480
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,563
I almost wish I was home
watching the Giants game.

481
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:20,197
- We wish you were
home too, Coach.

482
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:22,332
- Now, I wanna see one
hell of a practice today,

483
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,527
and we're gonna go an extra hour

484
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:26,236
just to make sure we're
ready for Pope John.

485
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,296
You're all gonna have to start

486
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,464
working a lot
harder around here,

487
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,307
if you wanna keep
chalking up the wins

488
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:32,843
and impressing the babes.

489
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:33,778
- Yo, Coach.

490
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:34,477
- What, Stewart?

491
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:35,839
- Don't you think it's
gonna be a little hard

492
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,548
with only five
players on the team?

493
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:40,150
- Yeah, we gotta play
the whole game now.

494
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,886
- Those other guys didn't
wanna listen to me.

495
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:44,154
I'm in charge here.

496
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:49,059
You five will just
have to suck it up.

497
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:53,363
Okay, let's get to it.

498
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,933
Come on, O'Rawe, move your ass.

499
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:04,983
(hard rock music)

500
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,137
- I'm leaving now, Lois.

501
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:35,472
Have a nice weekend.

502
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:38,308
- Oh, wait, I'll
walk out with you.

503
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,009
I'm done anyway.

504
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,878
- Okay, I'll tell
Kaplan we're leaving.

505
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:42,312
- Okay.

506
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:44,782
- I finished the last
of the alumni letters.

507
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:45,516
- [Kaplan] Oh, good.

508
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,710
- Lois and I are leaving now.

509
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:49,452
- Drive safely, I'll
see you tomorrow night.

510
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:54,090
Oh, how is the work on the
set for the play coming along?

511
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,393
- Good, they're working
on the sets backstage

512
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:57,521
in the auditorium everyday.

513
00:32:57,545 --> 00:32:59,262
Except tonight and
tomorrow, of course,

514
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:00,163
because of the dance.

515
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,365
- Well, hopefully it
won't get to rowdy.

516
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,366
- Well, let's hope for the best.

517
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,602
Goodnight now, sir.

518
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,002
- Goodnight, Miss Owen.

519
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,672
Blood Sucking Ghouls.

520
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:10,508
Whatever happened to
romance and slow dancing?

521
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:16,781
Now all they wanna do is
grunt, groan, and slam dance.

522
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:17,380
- Don't worry, I'm coming.

523
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,116
- Relax, I'm in no
hurry to get home.

524
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,652
- Thank God it's Friday.

525
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:22,485
- Are you kidding?

526
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:24,889
Now I have to spend the
next 48 hours with my kids.

527
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:27,324
(Miss Owen laughing)

528
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:35,098
(hard rock music)

529
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,133
That's the band for
tomorrow night's dance.

530
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,805
- I know, they sound good.

531
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:41,304
- You like that stuff, huh?

532
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,974
- Sure, you mean you don't
like rock and roll, Lois?

533
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,442
- I like rock and
roll all right,

534
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:47,277
but that's a little
bit too loud for me.

535
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,605
- [Miss Owen] Well,
I think I'm gonna go

536
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:49,980
check it out for
a little awhile.

537
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,474
- Not me, I have to get
home and make dinner,

538
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:54,417
and see what my little
darlings have destroyed today.

539
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,352
- Sounds like fun.

540
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,555
- It's more like
Nightmare on Elm Street.

541
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:58,949
- Well, I'll see
you on Monday then.

542
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:00,490
- Yeah, have a good weekend.

543
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,526
- Thanks, you too.

544
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:05,495
- Bye.

545
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,396
- I gotta take a leak.

546
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:11,602
Pause the movie
until I get back.

547
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:12,335
- Hurry up.

548
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:20,385
- Relax, I'll just
be a few minutes.

549
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:55,120
(girl grunting and gurgling)

550
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,864
Oh, shit!

551
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:16,332
(suspenseful music)

552
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:24,382
(girl growling)

553
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:32,950
- (sighs) Where the hell is he?

554
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,188
Screw this, I'm watching it.

555
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:44,494
I'll tell him what he missed.

556
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:47,397
(boy growling)

557
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:53,704
(suspenseful music)

558
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:58,809
Shit, he's missing
the best part.

559
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:05,649
(swimmers growling)

560
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,350
God damn it, Jeff.

561
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:15,358
This really pisses me off.

562
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:22,032
What the hell?

563
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:23,233
What the fuck is going on?

564
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:24,101
- They're coming.

565
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:24,935
- Who's coming.

566
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:25,769
- The swim team.

567
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:26,863
- So, what do they
want with you?

568
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:28,572
- I think they wanna eat me.

569
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:29,372
- (chuckles) Funny.

570
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:31,876
- I'm serious, these
monsters attacked me.

571
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:32,977
One was eating a leg.

572
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:33,677
- A leg?

573
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:37,848
- Yeah, I think
it was Miss Lloyd.

574
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:39,783
- Bullshit.

575
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,284
(suspenseful music)

576
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,586
(swim team growling)

577
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:45,523
Holy shit.

578
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:46,389
- That's them.

579
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,223
- The swim team?

580
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:52,830
- I think they're putting too
much chlorine in the pool.

581
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,632
- Come on!

582
00:36:54,682 --> 00:37:02,682
(swim team growling)

583
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:13,325
(mysterious music)

584
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:21,257
- [Woman] Die copper.

585
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:29,307
(ghoul grunting and growling)
(electricity crackling)

586
00:37:51,538 --> 00:37:55,059
(suspenseful music)

587
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,960
(Jeff grunts)

588
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,631
- Wait a minute.

589
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:04,068
It's time for a fire drill.

590
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:09,272
(girl growling)

591
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,307
(fire extinguisher thuds)

592
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:19,357
(girl screaming)

593
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:23,319
- This is serious.

594
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:27,257
- No shit.

595
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:30,060
- Isn't that Mary Beth Allen?

596
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,261
- Yup.

597
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,597
- This kind of shit just
doesn't happen around here.

598
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,367
- This kind of shit
doesn't happen anywhere.

599
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:39,803
- What're we gonna do?

600
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:41,772
- We get help fast.

601
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:48,012
First I wanna check
out the pool, come on.

602
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:56,062
(hard rock music)

603
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:04,995
(moves into dramatic music)

604
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:08,032
- I think the swim team
is gonna forfeit tonight.

605
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:11,334
- This is one very
fucked up nightmare.

606
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:12,870
- What're we gonna do now?

607
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,905
- We get help fast.

608
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:18,474
- Okay.

609
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:26,525
(ball thudding)

610
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:35,225
- Go get it, O'Rawe.

611
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:37,127
- Me, Heidinger threw it.

612
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:41,331
- I don't wanna hear it.

613
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,833
Just use the other one for now.

614
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:48,839
Come on, O'Rawe, go get it.

615
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:56,889
(ball thudding)

616
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:09,893
- Oh, man, I can't
see shit in here.

617
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:17,943
(ball thudding)

618
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:30,488
- Where the hell is that kid?

619
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,066
O'Rawe, get over here.

620
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:57,116
Heidinger, get that ball.

621
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,381
- Oh, Bob, uh, this is Joe.

622
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,618
I'll tell ya, Bob, I don't
uh, I don't feel so good.

623
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:08,585
That's why I called ya.

624
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,079
I want ya to know I don't
feel so hot right now.

625
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:12,723
What, what, what might've
been in that water?

626
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:16,459
- Just water, Joe.

627
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,394
We bottled it ourselves.

628
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:20,030
There's a natural spring
in the boiler room.

629
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,998
- Bob, it occurs to me,

630
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:23,433
I ran into these two kids
named Steve and Jeff,

631
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:24,268
yeah, Steve and Jeff.

632
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,229
Do you think they might've
put something into that water?

633
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:30,073
I'm a little bit uh,
curious about that, yeah.

634
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:32,009
- Those two guys,
Steve and Jeff,

635
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:36,246
they've been a pain
in my ass all year.

636
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:37,540
- Well, you could
really maybe do me

637
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:40,083
one very definite,
specific favor,

638
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,785
and check out what
was in that water,

639
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,454
because I'll tell ya a
funny thing, I feel funny.

640
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,524
Yeah, Bob, do check it out
for me, very important.

641
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:52,663
- Okay, take care, bye Joe.

642
00:41:52,713 --> 00:42:00,713
- Uh, I'm feeling very, very
peculiar, very, very something.

643
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,868
- Mr. Kaplan, sir, we
gotta call the police.

644
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:06,769
- Yeah, and I'd cancel the
swim meet if I was you.

645
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:08,145
- Just hold it right there.

646
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,581
Who do you think you
are barging in here

647
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,549
without knocking like that?

648
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,118
You just bought yourself
a couple of detentions.

649
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:16,053
- You don't understand, sir.

650
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:18,322
We've got a real horror
story on our hands.

651
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,323
- [Kaplan] A horror story?

652
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:20,190
- That's right, sir.

653
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,451
Mary Beth Allen ate
Miss Lloyd's leg,

654
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:23,493
and we had to stick
an ax in her chest.

655
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:25,295
- What the hell are
you talking about?

656
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:26,763
Are you on drugs, son?

657
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:27,531
- Listen to me.

658
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:28,658
There are these
things in the school

659
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,234
killing people and eating them.

660
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:33,403
- And just what
are these things?

661
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:34,671
- The swim team.

662
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,374
- The swim team?

663
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,242
- Yeah, the swim team.

664
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,776
- Get out of my
office right now.

665
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:42,412
- We're not fuckin'
around here, God damn it.

666
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:43,580
We need to get help.

667
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,982
We gotta call the cops.

668
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:45,883
- Are you totally insane?

669
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:49,052
You barging in my office
telling me some crazy stories

670
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:50,754
about things eating people,

671
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:52,890
and you expect to use my phone?

672
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,724
- It's an emergency.

673
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:58,495
- Emergency, your grade point
averages are an emergency,

674
00:42:58,546 --> 00:42:59,546
you two horror freaks.

675
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,165
The whole horror world
should be heavily censored.

676
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:04,001
It's brainwashing
you into making up

677
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:06,504
and believing these
incredible stories.

678
00:43:06,554 --> 00:43:08,038
If you gore fanatics thought

679
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,407
like the majority
of normal people,

680
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:15,145
there would be a lot less
problems in this world today.

681
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:16,547
- Screw this.

682
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:21,485
- [Kaplan] Put that phone
down right now, young man.

683
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:24,588
- It's dead.

684
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:27,124
- You're both
suspended as of now.

685
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:28,458
- Suspended?

686
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:29,586
- [Kaplan] Now get out of here

687
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,762
before I decide
to expel you both.

688
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:32,729
- Expelled?

689
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,599
- You can't expel us, we quit.

690
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:37,834
- Come on, let's get outta here.

691
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:39,703
- I'll expect you
both in my office

692
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:44,374
first thing Monday morning.

693
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:46,209
- Asshole.

694
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:49,246
- Hey, I gotta get the tape.

695
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:49,746
- Are you nuts?

696
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,007
We gotta get outta
here and get help.

697
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:51,882
Those things will kill ya.

698
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:55,118
- Crazy Tommy will kill me if
I don't bring that tape back.

699
00:43:55,168 --> 00:44:01,792
- Fuck it, okay, but after
that we're getting outta here.

700
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:03,260
What the fuck happened here?

701
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,397
- Oh, God, we're
dead now for sure.

702
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:08,732
- Oh, shit.

703
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:09,833
- Who would do that?

704
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:10,701
- It doesn't matter.

705
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:11,761
We'll get blamed for it anyway.

706
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,270
- It was the fuckin'
swim team I bet.

707
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,105
- Really, there are
swimmers out there

708
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:16,673
eating people's fuckin' flesh.

709
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,443
You really think anybody's
gonna give a shit

710
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,010
about a God damn TV?

711
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,178
- No, I guess not.

712
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:23,347
- Okay then, hurry
up and get the tape,

713
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:30,854
and turn the other one off.

714
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:32,990
- It's stuck.

715
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,927
- Forget it, let's bolt.

716
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:44,977

720
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,813

(suspenseful music)

722
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,954
Oh, my God!

723
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:39,423
- It's too late, he's fucked.

724
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:42,627
We can't help him.

725
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:44,027
It'll only get us killed too.

726
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:47,197
Come on, let's get
the fuck outta here.

727
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:54,505
(suspenseful music)

728
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:55,640
- Wait a minute.

729
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,173
- What?

730
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,240
- We can't leave yet.

731
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,775
- Are you fuckin' crazy?

732
00:45:58,825 --> 00:45:59,677
We're outta here.

733
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:01,111
- Those things are
still in there.

734
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:02,238
- So, let's go get some help.

735
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:04,915
- By the time it gets back
here, they're be dead.

736
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:05,849
We have to warn them.

737
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:07,317
We have to get them out.

738
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,252

739
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:10,854
I hope you don't mean Kaplan.

740
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:14,958
- No, not him, the
band, man, the band.

741
00:46:15,008 --> 00:46:17,695
- The band, shit.

742
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:18,663
Okay, we'll go back.

743
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:20,531
They're in the
auditorium, right?

744
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:21,932
- Yeah.

745
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:29,982
- Oh man, I got a bad
feeling about this.

746
00:46:37,497 --> 00:46:39,116
- Watch how it's done, homo.

747
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:44,421
- Yeah, your momma
shows me how it's done.

748
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,982
- I'm gonna kick your
ass, mother fucker.

749

- Your mother kicks my
ass every Saturday night.

750
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:56,441
- [Coach] Just
shoot it, Heidinger.

751
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:04,141
- Go get it, O'Rawe.

752
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,009
- Me?

753
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,336
- And I don't wanna

around the gym shit either.

755

00:54:03,777 --> 00:54:05,395
- I don't know.

891
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:09,299
(suspenseful music)

892
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:15,471

893
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:19,475

895
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:58,649

896
00:54:58,699 --> 00:54:59,249
- [Roxanne] Fuck this.

897
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:03,453
- [Vicki] Roxy, wait!

898
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:04,822
- What's she doing?

899
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:09,893
- Taking charge.

900
00:55:09,943 --> 00:55:10,828
- Oh, this is a great gig.

901
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:15,298
The kids are gonna love us.

902
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:15,799
- That oughta hold
them for awhile.

903
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:18,669
- Hey, what the fuck is
going on here anyway?

904
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,335
- I wish I knew.

905
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:20,303
- You mean you guys don't know?

906
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:22,364
- [Steve] All we know is that
they kill you and eat you.

907
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:23,907
- And they're real pissed.

908
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:26,143
- The whole fuckin' swim team?

909
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:27,044
- [Jeff] We think so.

910
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:28,846
- Maybe they should
check the chlorine.

911
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:30,206
- [Steve] It's not
the fuckin' chlorine!

912
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,042
- It doesn't make any
difference what the hell it is.

913
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:34,151
We've gotta figure
a way out of here.

914
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:35,552
- Just call the cops, man.

915
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:37,154
- We tried but the
phones are dead.

916
00:55:37,204 --> 00:55:38,756
- If you would all
just listen to me.

917
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:39,723
You can't just...

918
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:40,423
- Shut up, dick.

919
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,258
- Yeah, shut up, dick.

920
00:55:41,308 --> 00:55:42,893
- My name's not Dick.

921
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:46,630
- She's right, we gotta find
another way outta here fast.

922
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,065
- No kidding me, but how?

923
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,967
- I don't know, but
we better work fast.

924
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,169

gonna hold forever.

places to check out.

929
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:11,922
Things are getting crazy.

930
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:13,116
- Relax, there's probably
none here anyway.

931
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,358
Come on, let's get
this over with.

932
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:16,126
- What's the rush?

933
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:19,763
I mean, maybe we
should call the backup.

934
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:20,130
- Forget about it.

935
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,858
They got calls all over
the city, it's crazy.

936
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:25,869
