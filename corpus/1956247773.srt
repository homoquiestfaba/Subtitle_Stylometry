00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,796
- You're not working for Rincon.
- Hey. Listen, I'm setting up.

173
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:33,630
Soon, I'm gonna be
a runner like you.

174
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:36,133
You're not like me and you're
not gonna sell. Come on, man!

175
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:38,168
- This is bullshit!
- I gotta take care of your ass, too?

176
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,771
I don't wanna see you

00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:46,610
Yo, Daniel, my brother, my man.
Got a five? Got a ten?

179
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,513
I'm not coppin' no more, man.
I'm strictly buyin' food.

180
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:52,383
Takin' care of myself.
Got me on a meat diet.

181
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:54,317
Cuttin' out bread, sugar
and all that shit.

182
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,521
'Cause, man, them carbs,
that's the shit that's gonna kill you.

183
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:59,389
They call it a primal diet.
Primal like a caveman.

184
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:01,091
You know how them
vegetarians don't eat meat

185
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,393
'cause how it's killin'
all the animals

186
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:03,661
and they feel all bad
for the animals.

187
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:05,662
But you know what scientists
are sayin' now?

188
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:10,270
They sayin' vegetables...
Vegetables, man, they also got feelings.

189
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:13,403
Like a lettuce or a tomato
know that you eatin' 'em.

190
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:15,239
Straight up.
Heard this shit on NPR.

Said they done studies
on this shit.

192
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,046
Like, if you eat a cabbage,
that cabbage, it knows you eatin' it,

193
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:21,778
and it feels pain.

It got feelings, too.

196

So what are vegetarians
gonna eat now, huh? Rocks?

197
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,156
Man, they don't understand,

198
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:34,492
but in this world one man gonna
survive, another man gonna get hurt.

199
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:37,164
That's the way it is.
That's the way it's always been.

Abraham Lincoln initiated

00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:52,015
[shushing]

345
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:53,850
I'll get it, buddy,
I promise. I promise.

346
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:56,919
Hey, after three fuckin' times,
I ain't your fuckin' buddy.

347
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,158
Argh!

348
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,791
- You got that shit?
- [crying] This is the last time, man.

349
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,128
This is the last time...

350
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:04,698
Do your fuckin' job.

351
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:08,098
Jester. Jester.
Take care of this.

352
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,136
I'm trying to discuss
business with Lucas.

353
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:11,901
Okay?

354
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:13,138
[whimpering]
Yo, please, man.

355
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,708
No, man. No! Argh!

356
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:20,146
Please, man. Please! Hey, man, it's me!
I'm your boy, man!

357
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:22,983
- [door closes]
- [whimpering continues]

358
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,624
- What the hell is this?
- [Lucas] Oh...

359
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,890
Carlos said he couldn't pay.
His wife's sick.

360
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:35,694
But he promised
he would pay next time.

361
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:39,163
Didn't I talk to you
about this before?

362
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,134
He promised
this was the last time.

363
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:46,139
You know...

364
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:51,644
you got too much
of your older brother in you.

365
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,015
He was smart, but soft.

366
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:59,252
He got his ass killed on the other side of
the world thinking he was helping you out.

367
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:04,658
People have to fear you.

368
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:09,228
Your heart...

369
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,132
like stone.

370
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,936
- Understand?
- Yeah.

371
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,936
- [muffled screaming]
- [scoffs]

372
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:21,905
Paco, tell Jester
to keep it down.

373
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,077
I got my sister getting ready
in the other room.

374
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:32,986
You know, I felt sorry for
them, too, when I was your age.

375
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:37,189
I came here alone
with nothing.

376
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:40,393
Younger than you.

377
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:44,163
My father and brothers
killed in El Salvador,

378
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:47,233
my mother raped and murdered
by the <i>coyotes,</i>

379
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,236
leaving me to take care
of my little baby sis

380
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:54,106
born with a disability,
the way she is.

381
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:57,974
Had to do
what needed to be done.

382
00:23:57,976 --> 00:23:59,245
Know what I'm sayin'?

383
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,648
Just like with your father.

384
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:09,389
Fuckin' MAGAs wanna come in here
and take control of my own barrio?

385
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:13,055
The Bloods, the cops,
the <i>federales,</i> whatever.

386
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:16,729
You gotta be ready to do
what your enemy is not.

387
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:18,997
[speaks Spanish]

388
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:22,167
You know...

389
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:25,938
I wasn't always
the biggest dealer in DC.

390
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:30,743
But I was the one
who killed them.

391
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:35,545
I'm gonna send Mousey
over to Carlos tomorrow.

392
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:37,214
No, man,
you don't gotta do that.

393
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:38,349
Why?

394
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,085
No one's gonna take over that
crap-hole once he's gone.

395
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,155
And then the payments
will stop coming in.

396
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:43,890
So, I thought, what's better,

397
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,423
a guy with two broken knees
and an empty shop,

398
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:49,829
or we wait a week or two and then
the payments will keep coming in?

399
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:54,333
See, that's why I trust you
more than any of these clowns.

400
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:03,308
I got a drop-off for you.
Two bricks of smack.

401
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:07,610
Pure "H." Take it to the gas
station across the train tracks.

402
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:10,315
- There'll be someone waiting for you.
- By the gas station?

403
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:12,549
Give him the bricks,
come right back.

404
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,986
All right.

405
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:20,325
Lucas.

406
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,961
This ain't no ordinary drop-off.
I'm counting on you.

407
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:27,901
Get to the gas station,
make the drop, and come right back.

408
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,804
You gotta get ready
for the wedding.

409
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:46,351
[labored breathing]

410
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,101
Here, I got these from upstairs.

411
00:26:03,302 --> 00:26:04,871
They're dry.

412
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:11,076
Thought you said you were gonna
stick to your prescription.

413
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:16,416
[recorded male voice] <i>Doctors
changed up my dose again.</i>

414
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:22,021
<i>At least Lucas sells me
what I need.</i>

415
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,931
What happened
to the rest of it?

416
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,467
The tattoo?

417
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:40,137
I think it looks good
like that.

418
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,008
It's, like... more special.

419
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,188
Here.

420
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:19,445
[man] Daniel.

421
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,415
Let's finish the Caddy.

422
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:28,453
[Rincon] I want you
to keep an eye on him.

423
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:30,721
He's meeting
our friend from El Salvador.

424
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:32,455
You're sending him
across the tracks?

425
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:35,591
The car's still outside.
I got the feds on my ass.

426
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:37,930
I don't want no trouble
at my sister's wedding.

427
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,997
I promised her I wouldn't
have any deals go down today.

428
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,065
Then why send the kid?
I could make the deal.

429
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:44,503
Are you stupid or something?

430
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,005
Hmm?

431
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,209
I just told you, the feds are on my ass.
It's gotta be the kid.

432
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:56,082
Go, please.

433
00:27:58,016 --> 00:27:59,217
Jester...

434
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:01,954
leave his kid brother alone.

435
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,424
Yo. Yo, Lucas.

436
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:10,229
- I'm busy, Rodrigo.
- Too busy for the jump-in?

437
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:14,100
Whose jump-in?

438
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,632
Watch your head
and take it like a man.

439
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:19,802
And whatever you do,
don't cry like a bitch.

440
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,504
Hey, Miguel. What the hell?

441
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,205
- Hey! What are you doin'?
- He's not being jumped in.

442
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,774
- Yeah, he is.
- No way! My brother's not!

443
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:30,149
Just like me. Just like you, Lucas.
I got the call from Jester.

444
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:33,649
Besides, you should be proud.

445
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:37,521
Kid's got <i>cojones</i>
your older brother never had.

446
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,055
[laughs]

447
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:39,790
Miguel!

448
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,128
Don't let him scare you.

449
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:45,628
Just 'cause his jump-in left
him with a couple broken bones,

450
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,397
it don't mean
the same gonna happen to you.

451
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:49,398
- Come on, Miguel!
- What you doin', huh?

452
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,201
- What the...
- Fuck you, man.

453
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:52,735
Hey, Miguel! Come on!
You don't have to do this!

454
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:55,138
Come on, Miguel!
You're not being jumped in!

455
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,442
Leave him alone! He's just a kid, man!
He's just a kid.

456
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,408
Yeah!

457
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,279
- [grunting]
- One, two...

458
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,284
- Get up!
- [dog barking]

459
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,349
- Three.
- Leave him alone!

460
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,488
- He's a kid, man! Let him go!
- Four.

461
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:11,221
[groaning]

462
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:12,558
He's just a kid!

463
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,528
Five. Six.

464
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:22,634
Seven. Eight. Nine.

465
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:26,271
Ten. Eleven.

466
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:32,578
[inaudible]

467
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:36,082
Twelve.

468
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:38,618
[Lucas] Get off!

469
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,850
[Miguel] Lucas!

470
00:29:40,852 --> 00:29:42,054
Thirteen!

471
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:45,457
[cheering and applause]

472
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,763
- You a bloody mess!
- Hey! Get off him, man!

473
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:57,199
Well, at least
you didn't squeal like a girl.

474
00:29:57,201 --> 00:30:00,169
- Welcome to MS-13, bitch!
- Get off him. Hey.

475
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:01,471
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

476
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:03,273
Everything's gonna be fine.
Let's go.

477
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,511
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you goin'?
He's gotta get to his spot. Hey!

478
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,212
Look, I don't got time for this, man!
Rincon's gonna be pissed.

479
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:10,546
- What?
- He's gonna be pissed.

480
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:12,616
He wanted me
to take him to the drop-off.

481
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:14,184
- Yeah? Well, he didn't tell me nothing.
- Of course he didn't!

482
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:16,253
The delivery
is across the train tracks.

483
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:18,221
He wanted me
to take him with me.

484
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:19,356
- What?
- Hey, I...

485
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,224
You wanna go ask Rincon?
Let's go.

486
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:23,526
He should be with the priest and
Gabriela getting ready for the wedding.

487
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:24,496
No, no, no.

488
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,766
Well, go on. But then bring
his ass back to his corner.

489
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,534
All right. Let's go.

490
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,471
- [dog barking]
- Wait.

491
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,581
Come on.

492
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:08,507
That's what I keep telling you.
You don't run with the gang.

493
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:15,747
It's too late for me, but you're smart.
You have a chance at something.

494
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,585
Do you just wanna
throw it all away?

495
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:40,438
[engine starts]

496
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:44,409
You were right about
the starter relay.

497
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,213
Take it around the block.
Make sure...

498
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:48,712
[speaks Spanish]

499
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:49,782
What?

500
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:52,184
[speaking Spanish]

501
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,619

504
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:14,532
Wow.

505
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,306
- You look beautiful.
- [chuckles]

506
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:24,409
Thank you for everything.

507
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,522
I don't got
any pills on me, man.

508
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:42,460
We're good.

509
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:45,463
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

510
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:00,313
- The tracks are that way.
- We're not going to the tracks.

511
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,480
I'm getting you out of here.

512
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:18,063
- Why are we home?
- Just wait here.

513
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:20,599
- Lucas.

[dog barking]

515
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,521
[Miguel] Drink up, drink up.

516
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:18,187
Drink up. Come on.

517
00:35:18,189 --> 00:35:19,892
Come on.
Drop it and let's go.

518
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,057
No, I'm not gonna leave her.

519
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,892
I said let's go.
You're not taking it.

520
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:25,928
[Miguel] It's our brother's dog!
I'm not gonna leave her.

521
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,830
You think this is some kind of game?
I'm doing this for you.

522
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:29,466
Look, I'm starting out
as a drug boy

523
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:30,899
and working my way up,
just like you did.

524
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:33,135
You're always acting like my...
What is that?

525
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,706
You see what this says?

526
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,976
You got in. You hear me?
You got in.

527
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:49,921
All right, let's go.
We need to get out of here. Come on.

528
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:02,631
Shit, I lost a brick.

529
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:03,902
- [Jester] Lucas!
- Fuck.

530
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:05,671
Oh, shit.

531
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:09,571
Whatever this is, I don't got time, man.
Gotta get to the drop-off point.

532
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:11,140
Yeah, yeah.
Just like you told me.

533
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:14,113
Rincon said to take your
brother, huh, smart-ass?

534
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:16,713
That's what he said.
Why don't you believe me?

535
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:17,946
Oh, cut the shit!

536
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:19,851
Why ain't you
at the drop-off, huh?

537
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:22,588
And what the fuck's
your brother doing here?

538
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,461
Jester, you dumb-ass.

539
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:32,128
What did you call me?

540
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,664
Dumb-ass. You really think the deal's
going down by the train tracks?

541
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,566
You think Rincon
would tell your fancy-ass face

542
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:37,836
where the real
drop-off point is?

543
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:40,206
Just 'cause he's your cousin,
you think he trusts you.

544
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:43,907
With your Ricky Martin clothes and gel
and shit, like you're his right-hand man?

545
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,941
"Oh, I'm Jester.
You gotta listen to me."

546
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:48,644
You're not on top.
You never will be.

547
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:50,979
I'm the right-hand man,
and you know it.

548
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:53,251
Only me and Rincon know
where the deal's going down.

549
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,887
Get out of my face.
I got shit to do.

550
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:58,320
Come on.

551
00:36:58,322 --> 00:37:00,725

[both laughing]

553
00:37:13,905 --> 00:37:17,042
Let's go

[indistinct chatter]

555
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:26,619
Everybody, ready for the picture?
Come on, everybody.

On the right side, please.

Rincon, please?

559
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:39,731
Everybody's waiting.
Could you get in the picture?

560
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,800
Please?

561
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:44,135
Rincon?

562
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:59,918
Yes. Very good.

563
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:01,853
Smile.

564
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:07,957
You know how pissed Rincon's gonna
be when you interrupt the wedding?

565
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,727
- You wanna be green-lit, Jester?
- Yeah.

566
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:13,262
Except it'll be your ass green-lit.
[laughs]

- I'm gonna fuck him up.
- Yeah, fuck him up.

568
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,899
I should feel sorry for you.

569
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:18,934
You remember what Rincon
did to Smiley last year

570
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:21,004
just because he started
selling without his okay?

571
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:22,905
They're still finding pieces...
Argh.

572
00:38:22,907 --> 00:38:26,979
- [barking]
- Shut the fuck up. I don't wanna hear another word.

573
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:30,015
Got it, smart-ass?

574
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:36,986

I don't mind. We'll skin
your kid brother first.

583
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:03,114
Let you watch him die.

584

You like that, kid?
You scared, kid? Huh?

Not so smart now, huh? Huh?

Are you cryin', man?

595
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,314
Look at him
when he talkin' to you.

- Oh, he's gonna cry.
- Oh, you gonna cry, man.

597

- I think he got something in his eye, man.
- Don't do it, me brother.

Come on, you fuckin' midget.

00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:15,606
Shirt?

686
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:17,575
Yeah.

687
00:47:36,693 --> 00:47:38,195
Argh.

688
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,401
Okay. [groans]

689
00:47:55,412 --> 00:47:56,747
Where'd you learn all that?

690
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:58,749
Military?

691
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:06,224
My older brother was a Marine.

692
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,595
You remember?

693
00:48:11,528 --> 00:48:13,532
Yeah, he got drafted
as a green card soldier.

694
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,832
He wanted to get out, you know.
He wanted a different life for us.

695
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:18,600
He wanted to get out of there.

696
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:21,836
He used to send us pictures of
him shooting his guns. Remember?

697
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:23,340
It was awesome.

698
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,611
He hated the food from there.
And the weather. He wasn't used to it.

699
00:48:32,717 --> 00:48:35,686
He got killed in action
before he got his citizenship.

700
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,763
Yeah, so whatever.

701
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,638
What, citizenship?

702
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:56,338
Don't know.

703
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,840
Rincon just told us
if anyone found out about us,

704
00:48:57,842 --> 00:49:00,477
they'll take us away and put
us into a home or some shit.

705
00:49:07,952 --> 00:49:10,222
Yeah, the two of us.

706
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,625
It used to be us and our dad, but he
split after Jose left for Afghanistan.

707
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:18,262
Better off anyway.

708
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,765
You ever was there?
Afghanistan?

709
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:29,373
This will be the moment.
It will be beautiful. Your moment.

710
00:49:29,673 --> 00:49:30,742
Hey.

711
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,908
Of course, during the mass,
I will ask you to read...

712
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,780
<i>la carta del apóstol San Pablo
a los corintios.</i>

713
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:38,984
You'll be the one...

714
00:49:39,483 --> 00:49:41,852
[speaking Spanish]

715
00:49:45,423 --> 00:49:47,392
- Okay?
- [Jester] Rincon!

716
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:06,544
[Lucas] He's got the whole clique on us.
We gotta go. We gotta move now.

717
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:18,355
It's baseball camp for Miguel.

718
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:22,360
Let's go.

719
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:32,403
[Jester] I knew...

720
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:35,506
that kid wasn't goin'
to make no drop-off.

721
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,709
You saw him drive off
with the <i>chavala?</i>

722
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,577
He helped him get away.

723
00:50:40,945 --> 00:50:41,845
The package?

724
00:50:44,814 --> 00:50:46,318
He's still got it.

725
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,762
I always knew
he'd turn his back on you.

726
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:00,598
After all you did for him.

727
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:04,335
I gave you one job.

728
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:07,635
To look after him.

729
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:09,171
And you couldn't do that?

730
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:11,743
Now I gotta fuckin'
fix this for you?

731
00:51:13,177 --> 00:51:15,780
Get everybody.

732
00:51:17,414 --> 00:51:20,384
I want the bricks
and I want the kid.

733
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:22,820
Alive.

734
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:26,691
Yes.

735
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:36,934
Knowing Rincon,
he's got his drug boys on lookout.

736
00:51:42,506 --> 00:51:44,008
[scoffs]
It ain't here.

737
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:45,673
[Miguel] What?

738
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:47,175
The brick.
It fell in the car.

739
00:51:47,177 --> 00:51:50,047
- What?
- The brick. It's our only chance.

740
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:53,148
[recorded male voice] <i>Wait
here while I get another car.</i>

741
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,586
Miguel, let's go.

742
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:57,788
[recorded male voice]
<i>I'll drive you out.</i>

743
00:51:58,021 --> 00:51:59,523
Why do you wanna help us?

744
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:01,693
Let's go.

745
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:06,930
Look... Okay, I'll be back.
All right.

746
00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:10,602
[indistinct chatter]

747
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:15,840
[man speaking Spanish]

748
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:20,778
Congratulations.

749
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:23,814
I'm glad I'm not late.

750
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:25,749
I love weddings.

751
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:28,018
Go inside.

752
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,759
- [sirens blaring]
- [radio chatter]

753
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:47,005
Oh, shit.

754
00:52:53,977 --> 00:52:57,615
My first time in DC.
Maybe you show me the sights.

755
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:00,584
Who's that president
sitting on the big chair?

756
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:03,121
You shouldn't be here, Spider.

757
00:53:03,686 --> 00:53:05,923
I told you to wait on the
other side of the tracks.

758
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:07,958
Your homeboy never showed.

759
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:09,193
Hmm.

760
00:53:10,595 --> 00:53:14,466
The <i>federales</i> could've seen you.
They've been on my ass all day.

761
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:18,869
You mean those <i>hura</i> bitches?

762
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,539
I spotted that shit
a mile away.

763
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:32,784
Back in El Salvador,
they say you're hot shit.

764
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:36,119
"That Rincon, he a badass.

765
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,923
One day, he gonna run
the entire East Coast."

766
00:53:42,226 --> 00:53:43,291
I need badass.

767
00:53:43,293 --> 00:53:45,996
Don't worry. You'll get it.

768
00:53:48,231 --> 00:53:51,633
I couldn't get close enough to the car.
But I saw the brick. It's full of cash.

769
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:53,635
Cash? How much cash?

770
00:53:53,637 --> 00:53:56,037
I don't know,
but more than I've ever seen before.

771
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:58,543
Why is it full of money
instead of drugs?

772
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,012
It's back at the apartment.

773
00:54:01,278 --> 00:54:03,615
- What?
- The other brick.

774
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:06,648
I need to get that money.
Let's go.

775
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,686
<i>Capitan</i> is in prison expecting
you to make your payment.

776
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:14,323
I can't go back without
that quarter million.

777
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:17,529
You think this is local heat?

778
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,229
This is the feds
we're talking about.

779
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:23,901
After they took down
the <i>clicas</i> in Virginia...

780
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:25,802
I gotta be smart.

781
00:54:27,003 --> 00:54:29,905
They find out about the money,
they take out our entire crew.

782
00:54:29,907 --> 00:54:31,340
I gotta look out
for my <i>familia.</i>

783
00:54:31,342 --> 00:54:34,546
That's why this was supposed
to look like a drug deal.

784
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:38,815
And you were supposed to be
on the other side of the tracks.

785
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:42,052
[recorded male voice] <i>Run now,
while you have the chance.</i>

786
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:45,019
Chance? What chance?
Look at us, man.

787
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:46,887
The only kind of future
kids like us got

788
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,624
is getting drafted by
the army or by the gang.

789
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:50,626
And even then,
if I get into that baseball camp,

790
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:53,097
what chance you think I got
without that kind of cash?

791
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:55,600
Miguel, let's go.

792
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,200
[recorded male voice]
<i>He'll get you killed, Miguel.</i>

793
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:02,072
Hey, you don't tell my brother what to do.
I know what's best for him!

794
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:04,041
I raised him on my own.

795
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:08,309
Back off, all right?
I don't wanna hear that phone no more.

796
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:10,278
[labored breathing]

797
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,150
I sell drugs to you, man.

798
00:55:13,717 --> 00:55:15,253
Why would I listen to you?

799
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:17,854
Leave us alone! Let's go.

800
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:45,148
[speaking Spanish]

801
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,046
[woman] I'm on my way to my grandmother's
who lives deep in the woods.

802
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:22,283
[man] And what have you got in your
basket, Little Red Riding Hood?

803
00:56:22,285 --> 00:56:24,151
[children laughing]

804
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:27,388
[woman] Some yummy carrot cake
for my poor old grandmother

805
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,293
so that she can feel better.

806
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:31,126
[sneezing]

807
00:56:31,128 --> 00:56:34,329
[man] Carrot cake?
I'm allergic to carrots.

808
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:36,231
[children laughing]

809
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:38,803
[puppet show continues
indistinctly]

810
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:44,275
What are we waiting for?

811
00:56:57,121 --> 00:57:00,791
[whispering] Let's go. Come on.
Stay low, stay low. Come on.

812
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:03,827
[children laughing and clapping]

813
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:10,133
[knocking]

814
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:15,504
Anyone else down here?

815
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:17,041
No, just me.

816
00:57:17,775 --> 00:57:18,910
Come on.

817
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:20,912
Hurry up.

818
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:22,814
Thanks for opening it.

819
00:57:24,182 --> 00:57:26,417
- Come on, Miguel, hurry up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

820
00:57:27,383 --> 00:57:29,954
[Lucas] Don't worry about it, man.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

821
00:57:30,454 --> 00:57:31,823
Come on.

822
00:57:40,564 --> 00:57:41,866
Come on.

823
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:49,037
Hey, where you been?
Everybody's lookin' for you.

824
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:50,539
Shh. Quiet the fuck down.

825
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:52,407
Rincon's got the whole clique
looking for your ass.

826
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:55,109
Said you stole his smack.
Tried to make a run for it.

827
00:57:55,111 --> 00:57:56,544
Do me a favor,
go stand over there.

828
00:57:56,546 --> 00:57:57,879
Anyone comes up,
you let me know.

829
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:59,414
- All right? Thanks.
- Okay.

830
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:01,115
- Go it. Keep my eyes open. I'm watching you.
- Shh.

831
00:58:01,117 --> 00:58:02,450
- Shut the fuck up.
- Always watching you!

832
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:04,019
- Shut up.
- Don't forget. I got your back.

833
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:05,189
[Lucas] Shut the fuck up.

834
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:11,963
Come on.

835
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:14,030
Get back.

836
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:18,202
Hurry up.

837
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:24,041
Close the door.

838
00:58:28,378 --> 00:58:30,981
[music playing]

839
00:58:35,017 --> 00:58:37,053
[indistinct chatter]

840
00:58:40,057 --> 00:58:41,555
Is everything okay?

841
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:44,061
Everything is fine. Okay?

842
00:58:44,427 --> 00:58:46,029
Just like I promised.

843
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:48,933
Let us be.

844
00:58:53,236 --> 00:58:55,907
Go outside.
Don't talk to anyone.

845
00:58:56,572 --> 00:58:59,943
By the time the wedding ends, the money
will be here, and you'll be out of here.

846
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:08,352
Shit.

847
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:13,991
Yes.

848
00:59:18,227 --> 00:59:20,430
- [Miguel] Come on. You got it?
- [Lucas] Yeah, let's go.

849
00:59:25,535 --> 00:59:26,838
Come on.

850
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:31,372
Come on. It's clear.
Right out the back.

851
00:59:31,374 --> 00:59:33,110
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

852
00:59:37,113 --> 00:59:38,849
Come on. Let's go.

853
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:40,251
Come on.

854
00:59:44,186 --> 00:59:45,954
Come on, guys, let's go.

855
00:59:45,956 --> 00:59:47,224
- All right?
- Yeah.

856
00:59:51,327 --> 00:59:52,559
- [Miguel] Whoa!
- [Jester laughs]

857
00:59:52,561 --> 00:59:54,461
- You lying rat!
- Hey!

858
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:56,932
Don't be like that, Lucas.
Finally getting down with the gang.

859
00:59:56,934 --> 00:59:58,332
- I trusted you, man!
- [Miguel] Lucas!

860
00:59:58,334 --> 01:00:01,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, don't blame little <i>gordito.</i>

861
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:03,972
He's just doing
what he's told, man.

862
01:00:03,974 --> 01:00:05,273
Just business.

863
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:07,077
Maybe you should've done
the fucking same, huh?

864
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:09,010
[Lucas] Hey, get off me, man.

865
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,414
Let me see it.

866
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:15,052
- Where's the other brick?
- I don't got it.

867
01:00:17,521 --> 01:00:19,287
Where's the other brick?

868
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:20,624
I'm telling you the truth.

869
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,423
I swear.

870
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:23,427
[laughs]

871
01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:27,898
Oh, this was it?

872
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,198
- Ow.
- [Miguel] Leave him alone!

873
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,066
You wanna keep playin' games?

874
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:33,734
- [Miguel] Get off me!
- I don't got it, I swear. It burned in the fire.

875
01:00:33,736 --> 01:00:35,503
- What?
- It's ash!

876
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:37,073
It's all ash.

877
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:39,309
I swear.

878
01:00:43,113 --> 01:00:44,948
Where's the <i>chavala?</i>

879
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:51,988
- Ah...
- Hey.

880
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,059
What is that?

881
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:57,495
Okay.

882
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,229
They're ready.

883
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:00,931
Okay.

884
01:01:49,678 --> 01:01:52,215
[groaning and crying]

885
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,122
No, you stay away.

886
01:01:59,655 --> 01:02:00,590
This is all your fault.

887
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:03,791
You stay away. It's okay.

888
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:05,496
- [Anna speaking Spanish]
- [coughing]

889
01:02:45,668 --> 01:02:47,437
They were looking for you.

890
01:02:48,805 --> 01:02:52,276
They said you stole Rincon's drugs.
You and the kids.

891
01:02:52,709 --> 01:02:53,611
Did you?

892
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:05,352
They couldn't find them on
Lucas, so they were looking here.

893
01:03:05,354 --> 01:03:07,257
They tore this place apart.

894
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:19,202
They had them in the car.

895
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:21,505
Both of them.

896
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:31,148
[speaking Spanish]

897
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,598
<i>Está bien.</i>

898
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:53,470
Don't get involved.

899

[priest speaking Spanish]

900
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:18,561
What are you doing?
I could talk to him.

901
01:04:19,262 --> 01:04:21,532
Out of respect for my ex,
they'll listen to me.

902
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:28,539
You're going after them,
aren't you?

903
01:04:30,673 --> 01:04:33,675
You know what's gonna happen to
you if you go in there alone?

904
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:36,380
Do you know
what they're gonna do to you?

905
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,582
This isn't your fight.

906
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:42,186
Why don't you just call the cops
or something? Why do you have...

907
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,294
Francisco, my ex.

908
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,229
He got this tat
on the back of his hand.

909
01:04:54,564 --> 01:04:57,434
Three dots.
All the <i>maras</i> have it.

910
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,170
Do you know what it means?

911
01:05:02,872 --> 01:05:06,544
It's the three places you end
up once you join the gang.

912
01:05:07,644 --> 01:05:08,579
Hospital...

913

915
01:05:13,682 --> 01:05:16,186
You think
you're different from them?

916
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,621
You're not.

917
01:05:19,856 --> 01:05:20,758

921
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:34,470
No.

922
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:37,308
Just...

[Jester] Oh, man,
I can't wait to see your face...

934
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:32,723
when el Rincon
marks you <i>luz verde.</i>

935
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,925
Take you up
to Daingerfield Island.

Who knows?

937
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,738
Maybe he'll even let me
cut up the two of you myself.

938
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:49,773
I don't know which one.

See, I don't even know
the fucking rhyme,

first so you can fucking watch it.

You hungry?
You want something to eat?

What the fuck do you care
if they're hungry?

The kids don't need no food.

949
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:34,745
Now run back out there...

Get down!

The reason you ain't dead already is
'cause Rincon gonna kill you himself.

[Rincon] Hey!

1028
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,361
Why?

Why'd you do it?

1030
01:22:14,737 --> 01:22:15,672
You know why.

1031
01:22:18,406 --> 01:22:20,409
I was like a father to you.

1032
01:22:23,012 --> 01:22:25,348
I treated you like my son.

1033
01:22:27,348 --> 01:22:29,751

she's dead.

01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:41,798
Look at me!

1036
01:23:00,915 --> 01:23:02,384
Please.

1037
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,409
Lucas.

1038
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,348
Go.

1039
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:34,683
What?

1040
01:23:36,018 --> 01:23:37,887
And don't fucking come back.

1041
01:23:42,558 --> 01:23:44,427
You're gonna let him go?

1042
01:23:46,995 --> 01:23:51,431
After he betrayed you, took the money,
you're gonna fucking let him off?

1043
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:52,535
Jester.

1044
01:23:53,568 --> 01:23:55,604
You... you fucking lost it, bro.

1045
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:59,608
If you weren't so soft on the kid,
none of this would've gone down.

1046
01:24:01,576 --> 01:24:04,079
Well, fuck you, Rinc.
What you gonna do, huh?

1047
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:06,113
What the fuck you gonna do?

1048
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:09,786
Should've trusted me with the drop-off.
That's a kid!

1049
01:24:11,452 --> 01:24:13,723
You're my own flesh and blood.

1050
01:24:15,624 --> 01:24:17,791
My little cousin, man.

1051
01:24:17,793 --> 01:24:21,531
All I wanted
was to be the next in line!

1052
01:24:21,964 --> 01:24:23,800
- Now I am!
- [Rincon] Jester.

1053
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:25,867
No!

1054
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:27,570
No!

1055
01:24:28,137 --> 01:24:29,405
No.

1056
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:37,746
[grunts]

1057
01:24:39,915 --> 01:24:41,351
Toss it over!

1058
01:24:42,918 --> 01:24:44,720
You drop the fucking gun.

1059
01:24:53,429 --> 01:24:54,797
Give me the fucking brick.

1060
01:24:55,664 --> 01:24:57,500
Give me the fucking brick.

1061
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:11,781
[woman screaming]

1062
01:25:28,964 --> 01:25:32,602
[man] All right, boys, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

1063
01:25:33,869 --> 01:25:35,468
[choking]

1064
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,906
Hold his mouth. Hold his mouth.

1065
01:25:37,138 --> 01:25:38,473
Breathe. Breathe.

1066
01:25:39,508 --> 01:25:41,077
Give me two. Give me two.
Quick. Come on. Hurry.

1067
01:25:41,576 --> 01:25:43,243
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1068
01:25:43,245 --> 01:25:44,543
Come on. Breathe.

1069
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:45,947
[Jester] <i>Where's the money?</i>

1070
01:25:46,948 --> 01:25:48,617
Where's the money?

1071
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:52,854
Where's the fucking money?

1072
01:27:12,134 --> 01:27:13,803
Lucas. Lucas.

1073
01:27:16,338 --> 01:27:17,740
[gasps]

1074
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:25,514
We did it, Miguel.

1075
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,114
[cheering]

1076
01:28:34,116 --> 01:28:37,153
Come on! Come on, run!
Come on!

1077
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:38,920
Yes!

1078
01:28:39,888 --> 01:28:41,991
Yes, Miguel!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
