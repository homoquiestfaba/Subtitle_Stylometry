00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:20,994
<i>When I get downstairs,</i>

2
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:24,980
<i>and walk in that back room,
and see that bike...</i>

3
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,982
<i>it's just, like,
"You my girlfriend."</i>

4
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:28,984
<i>Like, I'm
talking to her, like...</i>

5
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,999
<i>"Yeah, we're gonna tear
the streets up today."</i>

6
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,998
<i>This your boy, Stro,
right here with it,</i>

7
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:34,980
<i>you feel me?</i>

8
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:35,992
<i>You know what's up with me, yo.</i>

9
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:36,998
<i>That's that bike life, yo.</i>

10
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:38,990
<i>M.N.C. fucking with it.</i>

11
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:42,980
<i>I start that bike up,
it's like a nervous feeling.</i>

12
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,989
<i>My legs start to shake.</i>

13
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,997
<i>Maybe police chasin',
maybe get hurt.</i>

14
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,993
<i>I think about everything.</i>

15
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:55,989
<i>But once I pull off,</i>

16
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,994
<i>all that feeling just goes out
the window.</i>

17
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:04,003
<i>And it's just me, the world,
the bike and the streets.</i>

18
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,993
<i>You already know anybody
want it, we can bet it.</i>

19
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:15,996
<i>Like I said, nobody fuckin'
with my young nigga, Stro.</i>

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,982
<i>M.N.C. boys, you already
know we in the building.</i>

21
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:21,985
<i>Midnight, it's your boy, Blax.
Let's get it.</i>

22
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,983
<i>Yo, Mouse, what's goin'
on, Mouse?</i>

23
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:24,991
<i>Come on, hop on.</i>

24
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:27,023
<i>You got it. You got it.</i>

25
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:29,997
<i>Ain't you supposed to be home...</i>

26
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,997
<i>- taking care of Mama?
- That's my brother!</i>

27
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:33,986
<i>- What you doin', Mouse? Oh, okay.
- That's my brother!</i>

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,998
<i>You wanna be with the big boys?</i>

29
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:36,988
<i>I wanna be just like you
when I grow up.</i>

30
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,978
<i>What you mean you wanna
be like me, Mouse?</i>

31
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:39,982
<i>You're gonna
be better than me, Mouse.</i>

32
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,006
<i>You're gonna be better.</i>

33
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,022
<i>If I see that sun, I know...</i>

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,013
<i>it's gonna be a good day.</i>

37

I'm ridin' it.

55

Them knockers thick over
this way.

56
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,013
Let 'em try and catch me.

57
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:45,983
You got five minutes.

58
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,487
He doesn't show up,
I'm takin' you in.

59
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,167
Yeah, that's Rivers'
little protege over there.

That Baltimore Buddy Program's
a little more responsibility

61
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,017
than he thought.

62
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:01,081
Glad I didn't do that shit.

63
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:13,994
Thanks for callin', man.

64
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:16,996
Said you're his mentor,
so I took a flyer.

65
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,984
So, what happened here?

66
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,985
Caught him on his quad.

67
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,994
Public street. Detained him.

68
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:24,658
Last thing I need
is this headache

69
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,979
right before a shift change.

70
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,283
You wanna take him
off our hands?

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,001
God bless.

72
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,563
Just drop me 'round this corner.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,991
Why?

74
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,992
Mama can't see me gettin' outta
no cop car with a dirt bike.

75
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,021
Gotta stash it.

76
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,011
You know you can sit up front.

77
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,991
Snitches ride shotgun.

78
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:53,014
Look, I don't mind
helping you out.

79
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:54,990
Always have been.

80
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:57,981
But I ain't no damn
get-out-of-jail-free card.

81
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,285
What you good for, then?

82
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:01,993
I don't know.

83
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:03,991
Stuff you can't take
to your mama.

84
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:05,987
Things you might want a man
to hear you out on.

85
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:06,994
I'm pretty good at advice.

86
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,021
Shit like that.

87
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,979
Like a big brother?

88
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:13,980
Hey, your brother's
death was tragic.

89
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,984
It breaks my heart that he
never got a second chance.

90
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:17,998
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

91
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,993
and that I got your back.

92
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,007
Just not for police stuff.

93
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:26,987
Can we listen to something else?

94
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,013
- Oh, what? You don't like this?
- No.

95
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,988
I can't hear you, man.
You've got to speak up.

96
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:33,998
- What'd you say?
- I don't like this.

97
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,987
- Huh?
- I said I don't like it.

98
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,994
Oh, you said you wanna hear
what I got.

99
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,980
No, that ain't what I said, bro.

Open up.

146
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,985
Yo! Mouse!

147
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,989
Why you looking through
the blinds? It's me.

148
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,017
I know you in there, my nigga.
Come on, open up.

149
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:01,987
What?

150
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:04,016
Hey, there's a new shorty
down the street.

151
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:07,017
She kinda bad, bro.

152
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,991
Where Sweartagawd at?

153
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,988
- Look at this slow-ass nigga.
- You tell him?

154
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,012
Hell yeah, I told him.

155
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:14,997
Swear to God.

156
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,986
Dime piece.

157
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,004
Swear to God.

158
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:21,978
All right.

159
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,006
Let me get my shoes.

160
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,046
Why you always leaving me?

161
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,983
Don't touch me again, fat boy.

162
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,487
Don't touch me again.
You fat as hell.

163
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:31,997
Nigga, you know
I can't go as fast as you.

164
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:34,021
All right, relax.
Don't try to eat my ass.

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
You're supposed
to be watchin' me.

166
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,015
Gonna be right back.

167
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,986
I'm just gonna call Mom

168
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,992
and let her know that
I'm home alone.

169
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:48,008
But it's okay,
since you'll be right back.

170
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,017
Damn.

171
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,994
Turn around, yo. No peeking.

172
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,013
I already know
it's under the bed.

173
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:00,019
Okay.

00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:12,993
This ain't enough.

00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,997
You better not tell Mama either.

00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,005

You wanna bet who gonna get her?

179
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:24,984

00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:25,996

00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,997
Hey, come on, nigga, fat boy.

Yo, but nigga, you ugly. So...

00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,007
Y'all niggas know I got asthma.

189
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,009
What's up, girl?

190
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,989

00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:20,997
How you doin'? My name...

192
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,992
Heard there was
someone new in the hood.

193
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:25,019
We just wanted
to make ourselves acquainted.

194
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:26,999
What's your name?

195
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:28,023
Nicki.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,991
You can call me Mouse.

197
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:31,997
I'm Lamont.

198
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,008
I stay, maybe,
just right down there.

199
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:36,998
And I'm Sweartagawd.

200
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,983
I'm an organ donor.

201
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:39,996
It just means
I can give you my heart.

202
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,984
- Oh, okay, anyway.
- Nigga, shut the fuck up.

203
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:42,995
You can hop on if you want to.

204
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,991
I'm down to show you around
if you want.

205
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,000
Not allowed to leave the porch.

206
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,980
- What?
- Wait.

207
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,987
Mouse, Sweartagawd.

208
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,986
What kinda names are those?

209
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,982
You know, that's just what
the streets gave us.

210
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,988
You know. You know.

211
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,998
So, are you guys, like,
a welcoming committee?

212
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:05,983
Or, like, the world's saddest
little bike gang?

213
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,981
Wow.

214
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:09,998
We just
got called a sad bike gang.

215
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,987
You got dope jokes, huh?

216
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,021
Here. Stand together.
Right here.

217
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:19,997
Relax.

218
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:21,996
Hey,
what kind of camera is that?

219
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,992
Ain't even got no screen on it.

220
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:27,989
Lot of the good cameras
don't have screens on them.

221
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,693
How do you know what the picture look like?

222
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:32,997
Okay.

223
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:35,998
Three... two... one.

224
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,992
Hey, you like takin' pictures
of niggas on bikes...

225
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,979
you should come down
to the Ride.

226
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:43,979
What is he doing?

227
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,021
- The Ride?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,022
The Ride.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,985
Every Sunday in the summer?

230
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,011
Midnight Clique?

231
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,017
Where are you from?

232
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,981
Oakland, California.

233
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,016
They don't have YouTube
in Oakland, California?

234
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,996
Let me break it down.

235
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,988
- Here we go.
- The Ride is the shit.

236
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:05,999
Every Sunday in the summer,

237
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:08,980
everybody with a bike show out.

238
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,988
You know, havin' fun,
doin' tricks...

239
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:11,999
- But you ain't got what it takes.
- ...hittin' 12.

240
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,985
Twelve?

241
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,997
You don't know nothin', do you?

242
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,984
Pull the bike back,

243
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:19,980
a wheelie,
but, like, straight up...

244
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:22,980
so it looks like the hands of
a clock when it hit midnight.

245
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,997
Twelve o'clock.

246
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:26,991
You new to Baltimore.

247
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:28,978
You gotta go to the Ride.

248
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,981
There's bikes as far
as you can see.

249
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,994
You know, it's loud,
but it's like, um...

250
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,013
I don't know, it's calm, too.

251
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,023
It's like the ocean.

252
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,983
- Did you just say ocean?
- Crazier it gets,

253
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,994
- the more calm it be.
- You gay!

254
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,985
Bro, the ocean?

255
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,990
Bro, you sound like
you in a Febreze commercial.

256
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:48,991
- Shut up.
- The ocean?

257
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:49,994
"It smells like the ocean."

258
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:50,992
I'm tryin' to...

259
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,016
Oh, you mad-mad.

260
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:56,985
Just sayin' the shit's lit.

261
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,009
Bet you could get
a lot of good pictures.

262
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah. Maybe I'll check it out.

263
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:06,988

- Ronique?

264
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,532
Swear to God,

265
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:09,986

266
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,993
Hey, bro. Shut up.

267
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:12,021
I gotta go.

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,003
- Aw, come on.
- So soon?

269
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:20,991
What are you doin'?

270
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:22,983
- Nigga, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

271
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:23,999
What the hell

272
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,991
Get off my lawn.

273
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,989
Foolish children, come back
and get the bikes

274
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:29,016
and take 'em with you.

275
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:31,996
Lord, have mercy.

276
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,979
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

277
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,203
- Boy!
- Wait for me.

278
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:37,996
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,983
- You know what?
- Please don't call the cops.

280
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,987
Yeah, yeah.
Mouse, though, for real.

281
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,023

Nigga, says history.

287
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:55,981
Every year, you like,

288
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:56,996
Then summer

00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:56,994
Ew.

349
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,022
That was a lot.

350
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
- Yeah.
- You want a hug, Ma?

351
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:01,981
You ain't stupid.

352
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:02,987
No, but I want a hug!

353
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:04,331
Mouse, if you bring
your ass up...

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
- Don't you dare.
- But I want a hug.

355
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,881
Mouse, I will lay your ass
on the fucking floor!

356
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,983
Stop it!

357
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,983
Get off.

358
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,987
What's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

359
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,980
Leroy.

360
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,018
I didn't bring you shit.

361
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:24,979
What's up?

362
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:25,989
Stand still, man.

363
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,991
This would go a lot faster
for the both of us.

364
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,022
I'll throw this milk
right across the room.

365
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:46,996
<i>You got it.</i>

366
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,995
<i>Ain't you supposed to be home
taking care of mama?</i>

367
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,981
<i>What you doin', Mouse?</i>

368
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,982
<i>Oh, okay, you wanna be
with the big boys?</i>

369
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:53,997
<i>Grow up.</i>

370
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:55,985
<i>What you mean,
you wanna be like me, Mouse?</i>

371
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:56,989
<i>You gonna be better
than me, Mouse.</i>

372
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:57,995
<i>You gonna be better.</i>

373
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,993
Mouse! Mouse, get out here.

374
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:02,023
Damn.

375
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,993
Mouse! Get out here.

376
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:13,982
...Grandma's house? There
was a rat under her refrigerator...

377
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,013
Get over here, boy.

378
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,023
What, you think I forgot
what today is?

379
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:28,989
What's today?

380
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,981
Oh, what you think, I'm dumb?

381
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:34,997
It's the first fuckin' Sunday
of the summer. The Ride.

382
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,023
Just 'cause I'm at work,
ain't nothing changed.

383
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,015
Your ass better not
leave this house.

384
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,002
You understand?

385
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:46,023
Well, I don't hear you.

386
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,011
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

387
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,982
Shay. His ass leave this house,
you better tell me.

388
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,994
Ma. Ma!

389
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:58,995
- If his ass touch that door...
- Ma!

390
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,981
- ...call me.
- Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

391
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:01,989
Hey, yo, shut up, yo. Shut up!

392
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,982
Don't tell me to shut up!

393
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,012
- All that yellin' in my house.
- Ma!

394
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,007
Better be right this time.

Shay. I'm gonna leave.

00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:45,020
Where's my money?

404
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:50,023
Right here. Move, you in my way.

405
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,023
Clean them Barbies up.

406
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,987
It better be double next time.

407
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,998
I ain't payin' you shit
next time.

408
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:59,980
Be in bed by 8:00.
Spaghetti's in the fridge.

409
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,983
Don't put it in the microwave
for over a minute.

410
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:02,993
Burn the whole house down.

411
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,984
- Where you goin'?
- Don't worry about it.

412
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,987
What do you mean,
don't worry about it?

413
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,006
I mean, don't worry about it.

414
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,993
I don't want...
I don't want spaghetti.

415
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:15,001
I don't care.

416
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:17,982
- Mouse!
- What?

417
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,993
- Bring me a chicken box.
- Man, please,
I just gave you money.

418
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,979
I don't care.
I want salt, pepper, ketchup.

419
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:24,998
You tellin' me your order
ain't gonna do shit
'cause I ain't gettin' it.

420
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,980
- Mouse!
- Eat that spaghetti.

421
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:11,004
Oh, shit!

422
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:15,984
Hey!

423
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,015
Sweartagawd!

424
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,997
Hey! Watch my shit for me.

425
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,015
What up, Kisha? How you doin'?

426
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,082
Hey!

427
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,011
Hey!

428
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,992
My nigga actually showed.

429
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:04,978
Come on, I told y'all.

430
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,986
- Hey, where your bike at?
- Behind the dumpster.

431
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,988
That's where it's supposed
to be at, nigga.

432
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:11,998
I swear to God, yo,
I'mma get me one of them quads.

433
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,998
Just like I'm gonna
get a unicorn that shit hundos.

434
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:18,023
Swear to God,
you always trolling, eh?

435
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,998
You guys, well,
I believe in you.

436
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:22,990
We gonna get there one day,
you feel me?

437
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,978
Yo.

438
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:25,979
Right here.

439
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,010
Look at this nigga.

440
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:31,991
Hey, nigga,
I bet you can't do that shit.

441
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:33,978
- Yeah, Mouse.
- Hell, yeah!

442
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,979
Go drop that baby Honda quad
on the boys, eh?

443
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,982
- I dare you.
- Yeah!

444
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,981
Fuck y'all, nigga.
I'm about to stunt. Watch this.

445
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:41,993
Hey.

446
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:45,983
- Mouse! Mouse, no!
- Yo, it was a joke!

447
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,023
- Yo. Stop.
- We was playin'.

448
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,981
- Get off the bike.
- Mouse, what are you doin'?

449
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:51,987
Nigga, what are you...

450
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:52,996
What are you doing?

451
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,988
- What the fuck? Get off!
- Nigga, stop. Get off.

452
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,979
- Chill!
- Yo!

453
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:57,996
- Nigga, it was a joke!
- Mouse!

454
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,991
That nigga gonna die.
That nigga gonna die!

455
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:04,010
His mom is going to kill us,
because he's dead, eh?

456
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:21,008
Hey, man, shut the fuck up!
Shut up! Shut up, bro.

457
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:38,009
- It wasn't that serious, yo!
- It was a joke!

458
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,001
Fuck!

459
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:47,998
Yo, get up, Mouse!

460
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,986
Warned your stupid ass.

461
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,983
Get up, nigga.

462
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:52,990
I bet
you don't think the Ride's
so beautiful after that.

463
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:54,992
Fucking dickhead.

464
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:59,993
Yo, one with the...

465
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:03,008
Yo, get your little ass up.

466
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:12,978
Damn, nigga.

467
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:15,984
You see me?

468
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:16,997
Yeah, I saw you.

469
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,987
You okay?

470
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,020
Yeah, I'll be a'ight.

471
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,985
I see you came down
to the Ride after all, huh?

472
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,987
Yeah. I told my Grandma
I was too sick for church.

473
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:31,978
She'll freak out
when she gets home
and sees I'm not there, but...

474
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,979
A'ight.

475
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:36,981
You were right.
I mean, this is crazy.

476
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:37,993
I already got some good shots.

477
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:40,985
That's dope.
You got me on it,
though, right?

478
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:42,992
I don't know.
Maybe if I had a screen.

479
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,991
Yeah.

480
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:47,994
That's right.
You ain't got no screen
on that bougie-ass camera.

481
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,978
- Shut up.
- Look at you
with your little camera.

482
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,018
Who's that?

483
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,991
That's Jamal
and his right hand, Queen,
right there.

484
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,016
The old Midnight Clique legends.

485
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,992
You see all these people
out here on these dirt bikes?

486
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:09,998
Those are just everyday riders.
But Midnight Clique...

487
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:11,987
they mad different.

488
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:15,006
They got the best bikes,
the best tricks,
the best riders.

489
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:16,997
They just the best.

490
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:20,021
So, that's who you wanna
be down with, then?
The Midnight Clique?

491
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,981
I didn't say that.

492
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,979
You don't have
to say it out loud.

493
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:26,043
You say it with your eyes.

494
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,010
That's Blax.

495
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,990
I thought
he was locked up, though.

496
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,979
Who's Blax?

497
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:38,994
You know Michael Jordan?

498
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,979
Duh.

499
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:45,009
Well, in West Baltimore,
Blax is that nigga.

500
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,010
What's up, y'all?

501
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:51,984
- Welcome back, nigga.
- What's up?

502
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:52,990
Come on. Come with me.

503
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:55,001
Come on, come on.

504
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,987
Aw, shit.

505
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,023
Hey. Hey, come on. I got you.

506
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,996
The first Sunday
of the summer, folks.
Y'all know the drill.

507
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,985
Shut it down.

508
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,982
Hold on tight.

509
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:42,998
Listenin' to me
is the only thing that's
keeping y'all from lockup.

510
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,006
Move!

511
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,003
Yo, what up? You good?

512
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,980
Man, fuck that chopper.
This my favorite part.

513
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,007
Queen!

514
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:38,000
Move, move, move, move.
Now, now, now.

515
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,982
Stand down, Officer.
I repeat, stand down.

516
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,406
There's a no-chase policy
in effect.

517
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,987
He smashed a brick
through my goddamn window!

518
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:02,022
This is not your call, Officer.
Now, stand the fuck down!

519
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,996
That is a direct fucking order!
Stand down!

520
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,008
Fuck! Fuck! Goddamn it!

521
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,988
<i>You don't mean that
you're thinkin' of testifyin'</i>

522
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,990
<i>against some people
that we might know?</i>

523
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:53,981
<i>I don't know, Charley.</i>
<i>There's more to this</i>
<i>than I thought...</i>

524
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,996
Yo, Ray-Ray, G,

with the Clique

525
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,023
by just going up
and confronting it.

526
00:28:59,001 --> 00:28:59,989
They did it. We can do it, too.

527
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:00,998
You trippin', Mouse.

528
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,989
Why I gotta be trippin', 'Mont?

529
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,980
'Cause you know damn well

530
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:05,992

531
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:09,980
Eighth. We finna be in eighth

532
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,999
What kids you know our age
is down with the Clique?

533
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:15,985
- Stro wasn't that much older
when he got down.
- Oh, come on.

534
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:16,997
I'm serious.

535
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,980
That nigga always watching
the same old-ass movie.

536
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,008
He won't move
one inch till it's over.

537
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,995
Y'all know, if y'all fixed
these damn cameras,

538
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,982
y'all will have a better time
spyin' on us, right?

539
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:35,994
Did she just call us niggas?

540
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:37,998
Hey, would y'all stay focused
for two seconds, please?

541
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:41,978
How we even supposed
to go about doing this shit?

542
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:43,998
You know I'm down.
But what's the plan?

543
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:46,983
Hey, we can just go

544
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:48,998

00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:51,982
A'ight,

546
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,984
Fuck that shit gonna look like?

547
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,019
So, we pull up, Mouse,
and then what?

548
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:00,995
Hey, look.

549
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:02,999
Y'all can do what you wanna do.

00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:07,982
But this summer,
I'mma fuck this summer up, bro.

551
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:08,995
Last year, I was just Mouse.

This year, I'm finna be
M.N.C. Mouse, you feel me?

553
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:13,999
One way or another,

554
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:15,996
and nobody gonna stop me.

555
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,990
You feel me?

556
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,997
Fuck, yeah.
That's the shit I wanna be on, huh?

557
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,980
You feel me? You feel me?

558
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:22,998
Man, this that big talk,
expensive talk,

559
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:26,011

560
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:32,981
What's it gonna be? You down?

561
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:38,980
Ah!

562
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:39,992
Yeah, let's go.
Let's run this shit.

563
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,008
That's what I'm talkin' about!

564
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,002
Yo, Queen. Check it out.

565
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,984
- Ooh!
- Oh, goddamn.

566
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,993
Man, these some fuckin' kids.

567
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:19,988
- What they want?
- They probably lost.

568
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,004
Can I fuckin' help y'all?

569
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,995
Nah. Nah, we good.

570
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,021
Well, y'all can't
fuckin' play here, so dip.

571
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,997
We ain't playin'.

572
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,981
Well, what exactly
is y'all doing, then?

573
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:36,981
Shit, we chillin'.

574
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:37,980
Just like y'all.

575
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:39,985
Oh, I see.

576
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:42,985
Y'all tryin' to chill
with the Midnight Clique, huh?

577
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:43,987
Well, how about this?

578
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,985
Y'all go get some real bikes,

579
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,689
and come back with some hair
on y'all nuts,

580
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,982
then maybe y'all
can chill with the Clique.

581
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,987
I told y'all this is
a dumb idea. Yo, let's go.

582
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:57,010
- Nigga, no, you didn't.
- Yo, I fuckin' said dip!

583
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:02,992
Well, fuck y'all, then.

584
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:04,982
What the fuck
did you just say, yo?

585
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,995
Yo, Queen, chill.

586
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:08,992
They small-ass kids.

587
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:11,998
What, y'all got no respect?
Y'all know this a girl?

588
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:15,007
Nah, we couldn't tell.

589
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:18,985
Let me see you twerk
that motherfucker.

590
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,979
Let me see you
hit 12, li'l nigga.

591
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,986
Got a hundred for you.

592
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,016
Scared money
don't make no money.

593
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,978
Man, you got it, Mouse.

594
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,014
Shut up, nigga.

595
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:39,998
Come on, Mouse.

596
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:42,991
- Can't even get
the fuckin' bike started.

597
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:44,976
-Come on, Mouse.
-Come on, you got that shit.
You got that.

598
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,120
Dumbass little kids.

599
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:49,003
Yo.

600
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,022
Don't be right here
when we get back.

601
00:32:59,007 --> 00:32:59,997
It's good. It's good. You good.

602
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,999
All you gotta do,
you gotta pull that back.

603
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,998
When you pull it back,
and all the liquid and stuff
just makes it going...

604
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:06,980
Shut up.

605
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:32,992
- So, you need a ride?
- Nah, I'm good.

606
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:35,011
-I got room, nigga.
Come on...
-Hey, yo!

607
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,992
I said I'm good, a'ight?

608
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,982
Sure. All right, nigga.

609
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:42,995
Shit. Don't gotta be
no bitch about it.

610
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,059
I'll hit you up later, Mouse.

611
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:49,004
Come on, nigga.

612
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,010
Work!

613
00:33:57,003 --> 00:33:59,004
Shit.

614
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,161
It needs a spark plug.

615
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,020
And you should change
your valves, too.

616
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,007
You work here?

617
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:23,001
Yeah, you surprised?

618
00:34:24,015 --> 00:34:26,985
Nah, it's just you...

619
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:29,010
You're M.N.C. Blax. I just...

620
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:35,982
Even M.N.C. Blax get a job
when your P.O. on your ass.

621
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:36,990
'Cause I ain't goin' back
to jail.

622
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:39,014
So, a nigga
gotta get it how he live.

623
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:46,016
Let's see what you
got here, li'l man.

624
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:51,987
Well, this shit done.

625
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:53,021
Ain't even worth my time.

626
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:58,007
Mouse, right?

627
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,006
- Stro little brother?
- Yeah.

628
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,981
Stro was a real nigga, man.

629
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:08,992
He always used to talk about you,
telling that you future M.N.C.

630
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,023
Not after today, I'm not.

631
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:16,989
You see that look right there?

632
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:20,002
Don't ever let a man
see you like that,

633
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:24,978
'cause you give 'em
the power over you.

634
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,991
If you gotta take a "L,"
you take it with your head up,

635
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:29,020
chest out.

636
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:32,000
Like a man.

637
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,006
Come on. Show you somethin'.

638
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:40,010
Come on.

639
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:50,997
See, nobody in the Clique
ain't gonna respect you

640
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:52,994
till you pull up
on something like that.

641
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:58,996
Aw. Goddamn.
You got a CRF 250 up
in here?

642
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,004
- Yeah, a little something.
- Ah.

643
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,981
KX 450F.

644
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:08,988
Yeah, I'd say anybody'd take me
pretty serious

645
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:10,983
if I pull it up on that shit.

646
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,979
I see somebody know they bikes.

647
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:16,993
Yeah. I know enough to know
I ain't got no eight stacks

648
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:18,989
for a 450.

649
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:20,979
Well, if you know all that,

650
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:23,014
then you know you don't need
no new bike, right?

651
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:30,978
Oh.

652
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,980
Shit. What's this? 125?

653
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:37,001
Yeah. You can get this
if you want it.

654
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:40,004
You just gonna let me have it?

655
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:41,999
I ain't gonna let you have it,

656
00:36:42,023 --> 00:36:45,014
but, shit, you could rebuild it
if you wanna earn it.

657
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,978
For real?

658
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:50,995
Yeah, for real.
We ain't giving away shit
for free.

659
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:52,023
This ain't a charity,

660
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:53,991
but you know
if you work hard for it,

661
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:56,003
you could leave with somethin'.

662
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:00,985
- What about my friends, though?
- What about 'em?

663
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:03,023
I mean, I'm supposed
to just get a new 125

664
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:04,985
and not put 'em on to the deal?

665
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:05,996
That shit don't seem right.

666
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,982
What deal? We never made
a deal with your friends.

667
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:10,994
I don't think you understand.

668
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:12,997
This shit on me
and your brother relationship.

669
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,022
Don't got nothin' to do
with your boys.

670
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:21,983
A'ight, so, why that mean
they can't get in on it, too?

671
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,986
You a loyal motherfucker, man.

672
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,999
There's probably
enough junk over there

673
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:28,981
for your friends to build
their little bikes, man.

674
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:32,018
Just make sure you be here
at 6:30. Don't be late.

675
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:46,998
Ay! What the fuck
were y'all doin', bro?
You almost made us late.

676
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:49,985
Oh, my God, nigga,
we here. Damn.

677
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:51,998
Swear to God, I ain't never
been up this early in my life.

678
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:54,986
Ay, look.
Y'all can't mess this up.

679
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,978
It's a big opportunity.
For all of us.

680
00:37:58,002 --> 00:38:00,019
Okay, Mom. Damn. We get it.

681
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,003
Come on.

682
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,998
What the fuck?

683
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:15,987
Ay, look,
I'mma tell y'all one time.

684
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:19,983
The first step is make sure
y'all keep every part clean
on your bike.

685
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,006
<i>♪ 'Cause you hang
With ghetto angels ♪</i>

686
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:25,019
Spotless.

687
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,022

Nicki!

706
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,989
Hey. I got something for you.

707
00:39:57,013 --> 00:40:00,013
Hi!

708
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,004
Be gentle with him now.

709
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,019
There you go.

710
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,982
You like him?

711
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:09,997
Does this usually work for you?

712
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:11,981
What?

713
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:14,018
Bringing newborn animals
around to impress girls.

714
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:19,005
- So, you impressed?
- I didn't say that.

715
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,986
They are hella cute, though.

716
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,017
Is he cute enough for me
to get that number?

717
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:29,979
You could get my number...
if I had a phone.

718
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:31,988
You ain't got no phone?

719
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,987
Girl, what year is this, bro?

720
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,978
My grandma took it
when I came out here.

721
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,983
Damn. She that strict, huh?

722
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:42,988
She's just worried
I'm gonna turn into my mom.

723
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:45,993
Which, definitely not.

724
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:49,003
Your mom, is she why
you moved out here?

725
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:52,999
I didn't technically
move out here. Um...

726
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:55,998
Visiting, if you could
even call it that.

727
00:40:56,022 --> 00:40:57,987
A'ight, well, we just gonna
have to make the most

728
00:40:58,011 --> 00:40:59,992
of your time
while you here then, huh?

729
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:01,998
Uh, and since you ain't got
no phone and shit,

730
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,980
we just gonna have
to keep it old school.

731
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,984
A'ight, well, like,
when I'm coming down the block,
right, I'mma hit this joint.

732
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:14,017
A'ight, now listen again.

733
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,017
That mean Mouse comin'.

734
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:21,001
What's your real name?

735
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:22,983
Myron.

736
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:25,001
Then why they call you "Mouse"?

737
00:41:26,006 --> 00:41:27,990
- That's a long story, bro.
- Just tell me.

738
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:29,994
- Come on, just tell me.
- It's corny.

739
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:32,984
A'ight.

740
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:35,988
Uh, when I was about
four or five or somethin',

741
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:37,992
you know, we had got a mouse
in our kitchen.

742
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:40,985
Uh, and, you know,
my mom was going crazy

743
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:43,978
tryin' to find that thing.
She would set traps and shit.

744
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,162
You know, goin' crazy, and...

745
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,980
What she didn't know was
that I had caught it,

746
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:50,992
put it in a shoebox,
and put it in my closet.

747
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,080
I've been Mouse ever since.

748
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,019
What?

749
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,007
I don't know. What?

750
00:42:05,014 --> 00:42:06,996
Shoot. My grandma's comin'.

751
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,005
Ronique?

752
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:14,985
- Hey.
- What?

753
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:17,016
See you, Myron.

754
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:19,010
Okay.

755
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,011
See ya.

756
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,981
Oh, this shit, Sophie.

757
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:39,003
I finna to be flexin'
when I pull up on this shit.

758
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,016
All the bitches
gonna be jockin'.

759
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,989
Watch. I'm tellin' you.

760
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:48,985
I'm tellin' you.

761
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:50,289
You ain't gonna be flexin' shit,

762
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:51,983
you don't be paying attention
while you doin' this.

763
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:52,991
- What?
- I've been seeing niggas

764
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:55,023
flex their way
right in the hospital.

765
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:58,993
For not paying attention while
they tighten their bike up.

766
00:42:59,017 --> 00:43:02,017
That shit ain't
happenin' on my watch.

767
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,993
This shit ain't
all about flexin'

768
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,992
and doin' it for the look.

769
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:10,978
What you little niggas
think it's about.

770
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,005
What, then?

771
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:15,003
It's about freedom.

772
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:16,998
When I couldn't get out the hood

773
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:20,000
and I was stuck on a corner
and caught up in the mix,

774
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:23,002
shit saved me right here.

775
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:26,004
Make sure
you respect that, a'ight?

776
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:32,001
Yo!

777
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:34,999
What's up?

778
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:36,978
About to go
to the spot. You goin'?

779
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:38,012
Give me a second, Mouse.

780
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:44,987
What's up?

781
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:45,996
I know you're in here
runnin' your after-school
program and shit...

782
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,997
but it's a bag out here to get.

783
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,979
Let's get it.

784
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,004
I'm good, man.

785
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,981
Come on, bro.

786
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,991
We want you to get some payment.

787
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:55,986
Shit waitin' for you.

788
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,983
I'm telling you,
I'm straight. Been good.

789
00:43:58,007 --> 00:43:58,988
Come on, bro.

790
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:00,983
Stop acting like
you don't need no money.

791
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:01,995
It's your cut.

792
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,003
Take it.

793
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,993
That's my motherfuckin'
jam right there!

794
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:37,999
Yeah, as good as new.

795
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:39,992
That's my motherfuckin' jam.

796
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:40,997
Ugh.

797
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:43,981
Nobody wanna hear
that old shit. God.

798
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:44,988
Y'all are bitches, look.

799
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:46,989
Y'all need to get
a motherfucking life.

800
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:48,093
Shit, I'm feelin' that one.

801
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:49,988
- Don't know why this shit.
- Coco!

802
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:51,989
- I'm tryin' to study, bitch.
- Hey, Teri.

803
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:52,992
Ladies.

804
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:56,023
Hey, Mr. Handsome!

805
00:44:58,004 --> 00:44:58,992
I was looking for Mouse.

806
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:00,990
Somebody dropped off some
Ravens gear at the station.

807
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:02,990
I thought he might want
a hat or somethin'.

808
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:04,023
He ain't here.

809
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:05,990
You know where I might be
able to find him, then?

810
00:45:06,014 --> 00:45:07,997
Um... He down at the vet.

811
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:10,995
He pickin' up all kind of
extra hours down there.

812
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:12,980
Hm.

813
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:13,995
I don't know why
I didn't think of that.

814
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,982
Mm-hmm.

815
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:16,994
Maybe I'll run over there
and see if I can catch him.

816
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,985
- A'ight.
- A'ight, y'all be cool.

817
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:20,988
Hey, hey, hey! Hold it!

818
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:22,992
You came up here
and you killed my vibe.

819
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:25,997
Could you let me get
my vibe back, please, baby?

820
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:28,978
- A'ight. Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Dance with me. Ooh.

821
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:30,362
There we go!

822
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,988
Don't hurt him, girl,
don't hurt him!

823
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:32,998
Watch the spin. Watch the spin.

824
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,996
- Yes.
- Okay. Watch it.

825
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,982
Okay. yeah, yeah.

826
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:37,999
- A'ight, y'all be cool.
- All right, all right.

827
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:40,990
- A'ight. I'll see you.
- Okay, see you, baby!

828
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:41,998
See you later, boo.

829
00:45:42,022 --> 00:45:43,993
- Sit your ass down.
- What?

830
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:45,991
You all up on
that man like this.

831
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:47,989
Y'all need
to start having some
motherfuckin' fun, yo.

832
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:50,994
I'm tryin' to get some dick.
That's what I'm tryin' to get.

833
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
What's this?

834
00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,242
It's for hip dysplasia.

835
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:00,999
Hip-what?

836
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:02,995
Hip dysplasia.

837
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:04,989
This little limp in her step?

838
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,987
- Yeah
- Happens to a lot of old dugs.

839
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:09,986
Bones get all outta whack.

840
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,982
Should be a'ight
if you treat it.

841
00:46:13,006 --> 00:46:14,979
And how you know that?

842
00:46:15,003 --> 00:46:17,019
I work at the animal hospital
sometimes.

843
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,010
Picked up a few things.

844
00:46:25,007 --> 00:46:27,013
I guess we gotta do
my baby right, huh?

845
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:31,994
See, Mouse...

846
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:34,178
if there's one thing I learned
while I was locked up...

847
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,001
if you down bad, you really
find out who in your corner.

848
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:44,001
See, everybody talk
that loyal shit.

849
00:46:45,016 --> 00:46:46,985
When it's time to be loyal,

850
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:48,018
everybody disappear.

851
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:53,003
You see niggas like that?

852
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:59,007
You need to be more wise about
who you're making friends.

853
00:47:01,015 --> 00:47:04,009
Somethin' your brother
should've been
a whole lot better at.

854
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:17,979
What are you doin'?

855
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:18,980
Yo, I'm a samurai.

856
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,979
Nigga, you a sumo wrestler.

857
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:22,323
Shut up. You ruinin'
my Zen, dude.

858
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:24,995
Ay!

859
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:27,981
Don't start this bullshit.

860
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:29,006
Ay!

861
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:31,983
What's going on, yo?

862
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:33,847
What the fuck it look like,
nigga? We chillin'.

863
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,160
So I guess y'all ain't comin'
to the shop no more, huh?

864
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:39,984
Y'all niggas some whores, yo!

865
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:41,989
For real. How y'all gonna
leave me hangin'?

866
00:47:42,013 --> 00:47:42,996
Nigga, look!

867
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,989
I'm not working for free
in no hot-ass auto shop!

868
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:46,997
Swear to God,
that shit be hot as fuck.

869
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:48,981
It ain't for free.

870
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:49,997
You gonna get a bike
at the end of it.

871
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:53,980
Nigga, it's the summer!
We supposed to be havin' fun!

872
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,994
Swear to God, that nigga Blax
like a mean-ass principal.

873
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:56,998
Real mean.

874
00:47:57,022 --> 00:47:59,023
Like a crooked-ass soccer coach.

875
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:00,999
You letting him
Mr. Miyagi you, my nigga.

876
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,979
Oh, really?

877
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:04,981
Wash that. Paint this.

878
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:06,016
Fuck all that shit!

879
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:08,992
Mr. Miyagi?

880
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:12,023
Mr. Miyagi? Daniel-san,
<i>Karate Kid?</i>

881
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:13,996
- Do you not know anything?
- I don't know!

882
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,979
It's a old movie about
this Chinese dude

883
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:18,363
that made this white boy
his slave.

884
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,989
That ain't what it's about!

885
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:20,997
He was training him to win.

886
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:23,023
He did. We could win, too!
Come on!

887
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,998
While he was doing
all that fuckboy shit, too?

888
00:48:26,022 --> 00:48:27,984
Nigga, not me.

889
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,981
I'm tryin' to be like
them Cobra Kai niggas.

890
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:30,989
They were swipin'
nigga legs off, RIP!

891
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:31,997
Yeah, I like the Cobra Kai.

892
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:33,990
Y'all missin' the whole point.

893
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:35,992
We ain't gonna get another
chance like this to get a bike!

894
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:38,982
No, no, no.
You missin' the point.

895
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:39,994
That ain't even
how you go about gettin'

896
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,983
your own bike
in Baltimore City, yo.

897
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:44,001
How you do it, then? Huh?

898
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,011
Like that.

899
00:48:51,022 --> 00:48:52,989
Here come Mr. Miyagi number two.

900
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,978
Damn.

901
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:55,993
Just that easy.

902
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,982
Yeah.
Came over here yelling.
For real.

903
00:48:58,006 --> 00:48:58,991
- Yo, poor Mouse, yo.
- Damn it!

904
00:48:59,015 --> 00:49:00,986
He real-life confused.

905
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,991
He don't know
how he like his eggs.

906
00:49:03,015 --> 00:49:05,991
He don't know
what sock to put on first.

907
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:07,992
Smartest people ruin your life.

908
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:10,014
Nigga thinks he's so fine.

909
00:49:11,016 --> 00:49:13,010
Man, fuck the police.

910
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:15,994
Yeah, fuck the police.

911
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:20,986
Mouse, come sit up front.

912
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,987
I told you, I ain't no snitch.

913
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:24,984
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

914
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:26,008
Come sit up front.

915
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,995
You know Tupac grew up
in Baltimore, right?

916
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,022
How can I not know that?

917
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,978
That's all you old folks
ever talk about.

918
00:49:54,002 --> 00:49:55,999
"Tupac from Baltimore."
Who cares?

919
00:49:56,023 --> 00:49:59,002
Nigga died, like,
a million years ago.

920
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,001
I saw you at the Ride.

921
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:12,999
I thought we talked about
keeping that quad

922
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:14,996
- off the main streets.
- No.

923
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,985
- You talked about that.
- Where you been at today, yo?

924
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:19,980
Minding my business.

925
00:50:20,004 --> 00:50:21,990
Well, your mama think
you at the animal hospital.

926
00:50:22,014 --> 00:50:23,998
And the animal hospital think
you out sick.

927
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:27,988
And I find you with the homies
lookin' pretty damn healthy.

928
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:30,981
Can't jerk around your job, yo.

929
00:50:31,005 --> 00:50:31,996
Job.

930
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,991
Pretty sure a job gotta pay.

931
00:50:34,015 --> 00:50:34,996
Oh, they pay you.

932
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,998
When I hooked you up over there,

933
00:50:36,022 --> 00:50:36,997
I made sure of that.

934
00:50:37,021 --> 00:50:38,992
Uh, barely.

935
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,978
Not even minimum wage.

936
00:50:41,002 --> 00:50:41,996
That's because they can't.

937
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,992
You're not old enough yet.

938
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:47,013
They give you what they can,
when they can, off the books.

939
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:49,988
What you want me
to do with that?

940
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:52,014
You know exactly
what to do with that.

941
00:50:53,022 --> 00:50:54,990
Go to work.

942
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:56,983
Keep your nose clean
and don't let me see

943
00:50:57,007 --> 00:50:59,004
you on them damn bikes again.

944
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:01,994
I'm not playin', Mouse.

945
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:02,999
Do not get me twisted.

946
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:05,023
I will lock your little ass up.

955
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:37,987
I rebuilt it for
one of my customers

956
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,983
down there on King and Ferry.

957
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:41,992
I gotta get it back to him.

You know where that's at?

959
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,002

What I look like?

967
00:52:00,022 --> 00:52:01,984
You look like
somebody that'd crash

968

to get into a chase.

969

00:52:08,017 --> 00:52:10,003
Well, come on.

971
00:52:12,023 --> 00:52:13,999
Okay.

973
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:18,988
- So make sure
you can handle it.

974
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:20,012
Go ahead, start it up.

975
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,986
- Yeah.
- Hey, look.

976
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,999
Take the bike straight there

977
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:30,986
and take the bus back.

978
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,989

00:53:32,013 --> 00:53:34,016
Hi. What's this?

996
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:35,994
This?

997
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:38,991
This is what happens

998
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,993
Hey, what's with Stro's helmet?

999
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,993
None of your business.

1000
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:45,983
Hey, I, uh... I'll hit y'all up.

1001
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:56,013
Yo!

1002
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:58,982
What the fuck.

1003
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:01,978
Bro, did you see
the shocks on that shit?

1004
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:03,004
It was all right.

1005
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:06,997
Like I was sayin'

1006
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:09,010
I'm not playin'...

1007
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:19,010
Come on.

1008
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:26,998
New bike?

1009
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:28,998
It's a loaner.

1010
00:54:29,022 --> 00:54:30,989
Looks fast.

1011
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:33,017
Whatever you think,
it's faster than that.
Trust me.

1012
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:36,017
Where your grandmama?

1013
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:38,021
Work.

1014
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:41,006
Get on.

1015
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:43,998
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1016
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:45,022
Hm.

1017
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,996
It's a special helmet.

1018
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,023
- Tell you about it later.
- Okay.

1019
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:52,012
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1020
00:54:53,012 --> 00:54:54,017
Hold on tight.

1021
00:54:58,007 --> 00:54:59,982
Is this your brother's helmet?

1022
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,009
Yeah.

1023
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:03,991
When Stro died,

1024
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:05,994
my mom just throwed out
a bunch of his stuff.

1025
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:08,990
Got rid of it. I told her
to let me keep the helmet...

1026
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,997
because I know he would've
wanted me to have it.

1027
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:13,978
What was he like?

1028
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:16,003
Stro was such a good dude.

1029
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:17,980
Real good dude.

1030
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:19,996
I mean, everybody loved him.

1031
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,001
Everybody.

1032
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,995
He was my mama's firstborn
and she loved Stro.

1033
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,988
I mean, she loved-loved him.

1034
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:33,011
I know she loved him
more than she loved me.

1035
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,015
Don't say that.

1036
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,002
I miss him.

1037
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,484
You know, he used
to always talk about

1038
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,480
how he was gonna
take me to the ocean.

1039
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:47,988
Always used to be goin' on,
and on, and on

1040
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,007
about how much I'd love it.

1041
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:54,014
You never been?

1042
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:56,017
To the ocean.

1043
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:58,983
No.

1044
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,979
What about
"The Ride's like the ocean"?

1045
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:07,022
Stop trippin', bro.
That's what he used
to always say.

1046
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:09,999
You're talking about a dude

1047
00:56:10,023 --> 00:56:13,004
that ain't ever been outside
West Baltimore before.

1048
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,991
I know I haven't either.

1049
00:56:16,015 --> 00:56:17,997
And I know he probably
wanted the best for me,

1050
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:19,981
but it's like...

1051
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:21,005
Hey, Mouse.

1052
00:56:22,017 --> 00:56:24,021
Ah, man, what you do that for?

1053
00:56:26,004 --> 00:56:27,981
Candid. No posing.

1054
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:29,987
- The real you.
- Aw, man, bump all of that.

1055
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,997
How do you even work this joint?

1056
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:34,001
A'ight, let me show you.
Let me show you.

1057
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,993
Focus.

1058
00:56:37,017 --> 00:56:38,989
Crank. Okay, you did that...

1059
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:41,133
and then take the picture.

1060
00:56:47,022 --> 00:56:49,001
Focus.

1061
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:51,004
Crank it.

1062
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:58,981
Take the picture.

1063
00:56:59,005 --> 00:57:00,007
You got it.

1064
00:57:09,003 --> 00:57:10,006
We'll go one day.

1065
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:12,014
Where?

1066
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:15,011
The ocean.

1067
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:18,011
When are you leaving?

1068
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:21,011
About a month from now.

1069
00:57:24,003 --> 00:57:25,007
Will you wait for me?

1070
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,002
Mm-hmm.

1071
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,000
Not yet.

1072
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:44,017
Yo, Mouse.

1073
00:57:45,023 --> 00:57:46,986
You Mouse, right?

1074
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:47,995
- Yeah.
- I'm D.

1075
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:50,979
I used to hang
with your brother, Stro.

1076
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:53,985
Yeah, Derrick, right?
I remember you.

1077
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:54,994
What's up, bro?

1078
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:56,999
Yeah, man, let me get
a ride on that thing.

1079
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,984
Ah, nah, man,
it's not even mine.

1080
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:00,999
- I'm just holdin' it.
- Come on, man.

1081
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,992
Just let me get a ride, man.
I'm not goin' nowhere.

1082
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:04,995
I'm just gonna be right here.
To the corner and back.

1083
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,985
Uh...

1084
00:58:07,009 --> 00:58:08,988
What, you scared?
Don't be scared, bro.

1085
00:58:09,012 --> 00:58:10,981
I'm not goin' nowhere.

1086
00:58:11,005 --> 00:58:12,976
They're waitin'.
I ain't even say I was scared.
I'm just...

1087
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,400
Well, let me get
a ride on the bike.

1088
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:17,990
No.

1089
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:19,999
You just goin' up the block
and comin' right back?

1090
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:23,003
To the corner
and right back, bro.

1091
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:27,003
A'ight.

1092
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:37,244
- To the corner and right back.
- To the corner and back.

1093
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:00,008
Got no space back here, man.

1094
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:03,246
I'm takin' it around the block.

1095
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:36,006
Shit!

1096
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:40,991
What the actual fuck
were you thinking?

1097
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:43,992
Why would you even let
somebody ride that bike?

1098
00:59:44,016 --> 00:59:46,982
Swear to God,
I wouldn't let no one touch
Blax's shit.

1099
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:50,023
I know. I fucked up.
I know. A'ight.

1100
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:54,009
I wanna know why Blax
lettin' you just walk around
like shit cool.

1101
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:56,996
You ain't tell him.

1102
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,994
You ain't tell...
What are you waiting for?

1103
01:00:00,018 --> 01:00:01,983
I mean, it ain't like you
any less dead

1104
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:03,016
when that nigga find out.

1105
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,160
I know the nigga who took it.

1106
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,019
What's his name, yo?

1107
01:00:10,002 --> 01:00:10,978
Derrick.

1108
01:00:11,002 --> 01:00:12,985
- Damn.
- Derrick, Derrick?

1109
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,991
- Live around the way, Derrick?
- Yeah, that Derrick.

1110
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:16,998
Yo, that boy stay
choppin' up bikes, Mouse.

1111
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:18,994
That shit's gone. Forever.

1112
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:21,978
Man, I don't even know
why I be talkin' to y'all,
see...

1113
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:23,282
Okay, okay, okay, look.

1114
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:26,986
What you wanna do, then?

1115
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,994
I mean,
'cause I could find out
where that nigga stay at.

1116
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:30,991
Stomp his ass into
a pavement right quick.

1117
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:33,019
How's that gonna help? Huh?

1118
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:36,987
Who knows? Maybe it won't.

1119
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:38,978
I mean, but if you got
a Derrick pancake

1120
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:39,988
stuck on the bottom
of your shoe...

1121
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,985
At least Blax'll know
you ain't no punk.

1122
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:44,979
I'd be still thinking
he a little punk.

1123
01:00:45,003 --> 01:00:46,988
You did let his bike get took.

1124
01:00:47,012 --> 01:00:48,995
Nigga, I'd rather be
half a punk who
got his ass beat

1125
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:52,003
than a whole punk
who didn't do nothin'.

1126
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,004
We with you.

1127
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:57,001
What you wanna do?

1128
01:00:59,013 --> 01:01:00,015
Let's go.

1129
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:09,993
So, you got
Blax's bike stolen,
and you ain't get a kiss?

1130
01:01:10,017 --> 01:01:11,992
So, what now?
You gonna call her?

1131
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:13,998
Yeah, and look thirsty?
Nah, bro.

1132
01:01:14,022 --> 01:01:15,985
So you dud her.

1133
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:18,013
Can we talk about
somethin' else, please?

1134
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:20,996
I'm gonna keep it
G-real with you.

1135
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,980
I don't like the light in here.

1136
01:01:23,004 --> 01:01:23,990
It like a fuckin'
horror story, yeah?

1137
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,993
Yeah, this it.

1138
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:27,984
Shit look like
a old meat locker.

1139
01:01:28,008 --> 01:01:29,208
Probably 'cause it is.

1140
01:01:32,012 --> 01:01:34,982
I bet you that nigga in there.

1141
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:36,998
Okay, so we can go in there
and be, like, "Excuse me, sir,

1142
01:01:37,022 --> 01:01:38,988
"do you mind stepping out
your humble abode

1143
01:01:39,012 --> 01:01:40,984
so we could beat
the ever-lovin' shit out you?"

1144
01:01:41,008 --> 01:01:42,994
- Hey, yo, Derrick!
- Ay!

1145
01:01:43,018 --> 01:01:45,022
- Yo, Derrick!
- Shut up.

1146
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:50,994
Stop.

1147
01:01:51,018 --> 01:01:55,001
- God damn it. Fuck.
- Fuck you doin' here, Mouse?

1148
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,017
Bike's gone.

1149
01:01:59,010 --> 01:01:59,993
Wasn't mine.

1150
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,985
It was M.N.C. Blax's bike.

1151
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,005
You don't know
no fuckin' M.N.C. Blax.

1152
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:07,998
Why the fuck would you
do me like that, huh?

1153
01:02:08,022 --> 01:02:09,996
This shit happen all the time.
You know this.

1154
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,982
Nah, it's different.
We go way back, bro.

1155
01:02:13,006 --> 01:02:14,011
It's messed up.

1156
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:18,017
Yeah, well, you live
and you learn.

1157
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,007
We all gotta eat.

1158
01:02:23,013 --> 01:02:24,021
Go home, Mouse.

1159
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:26,987
Let's just go.

1160
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:27,989
Fuck that.

1161
01:02:28,013 --> 01:02:30,000
- Let's just go.
- Fuck that.

1162
01:02:32,012 --> 01:02:33,996
Y'all ain't hear
what the fuck I just said?

1163
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,999
Get the fuck out of here
before I fuck y'all up.

1164
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:37,986
Who you think
you're fuckin' up, yo?

1165
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,990
All of y'all, don't push me!

1166
01:02:39,014 --> 01:02:40,983
Nigga, I'm pushing. What's up?

1167
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,984
- Ay, Lamont. Let's just go.
- Yo, yo, fucking chill, Lamont.

1168
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:43,996
You ain't gonna do shit.

1169
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,982
- You heard
what the fuck I said!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1170
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:46,996
Yo! Yo! Fuckin' chill, yo.

1171
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,994
- Get the fuck away from him.
- Put that gun down.

1172
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:51,022
- Lamont, ay!
- Talk that tough shit now!

1173
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,989
Lamont! Let's go!

1174
01:02:53,013 --> 01:02:54,994
That's what
the fuck I thought.
Didn't I say dip?

1175
01:02:55,018 --> 01:02:57,987
Roll out!

1176
01:02:58,011 --> 01:02:59,011
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1177
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:18,010
Derrick, right?

1178
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:21,988
We already know.

1179
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:23,983
Don't too many people
get away with stealin'

1180
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:26,003
no bikes
and we don't know about it.

1181
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:30,007
I see you got your little strap.

1182
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:34,987
I used to play with them, too.
Until I got on parole.

1183
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,990
I ain't got it,
but y'all got it?

1184
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,983
Is a fat baby heavy?

1185
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,018
Shit. Don't get done up
by no girl, nigga.

1186
01:03:47,016 --> 01:03:49,003
You know who I am, right?

1187
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:51,983
- M.N.C. Blax.
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.

1188
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:54,001
That was a rhetorical question.

1189
01:03:57,019 --> 01:03:59,023
Man, I can start
to pay you now, man.

1190
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:01,989
- We can figure somethin' out.
- It's already figured out.

1191
01:04:02,013 --> 01:04:03,984
- Hey, look,
I'mma tell you one time.
- Fuck wrong with you?

1192
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,980
We catch you touchin'
one of our fuckin' bikes

1193
01:04:06,004 --> 01:04:08,016
and I'm gonna blow
your fuckin' brains out, nigga.

1194
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:11,004
You understand me?

1195
01:04:18,011 --> 01:04:19,023
Yo. Yo.

1196
01:04:20,001 --> 01:04:22,988
That's what you do
to a nigga that took
your bike? Talk?

1197
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:24,992
It got out he took our shit
without repercussions,

1198
01:04:25,016 --> 01:04:26,023
that's on us.

1199
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:29,983
- You M.N.C. Blax.
- It's already over with, man.

1200
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,022
This nigga need the shit
beat out of him, for real.

1201
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:37,012
I said we out.

1202
01:04:42,013 --> 01:04:43,022
Yo, we out, yo.

1203
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,015
Thanks, man.

1204
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:49,984
Thanks, Blax, man...

1205
01:04:52,004 --> 01:04:53,006
Oh, shit.

1206
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,400
- Yo, chill.
- Lamont.

1207
01:05:02,016 --> 01:05:02,993
Oh.

1208
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:04,018
Lamont.

1209
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:07,994
Oh, shit.

1210
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:10,979
Now who talkin' that tough shit?

1211
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:12,997
- Come on, boy, nigga...
- Yo, chill!

1212
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:15,994
Lamont! Yo, get off of him.
Lamont, get off of him.

1213
01:05:16,018 --> 01:05:17,997
He needed that. He needed that.

1214
01:05:18,021 --> 01:05:22,978
Yo. Yo! Yo! Chill.

1215
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,990
Young boy, young boy, chill.
Chill, chill.

1216
01:05:25,014 --> 01:05:27,023
Don't need you catching
no body just yet.

1217
01:05:34,016 --> 01:05:35,096
Learned your lesson, right?

1218
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:40,014
Bitch-ass nigga.

1219
01:06:48,012 --> 01:06:49,015
Talk.

1220
01:06:51,014 --> 01:06:53,978
I-I stopped by the park
real quick.

1221
01:06:54,002 --> 01:06:57,021
And then this dude
just fuckin' jacked me.

1222
01:06:59,002 --> 01:07:00,014
So he put a gun to you?

1223
01:07:06,008 --> 01:07:07,992
So, how he jack you?

1224
01:07:08,016 --> 01:07:11,994
Well, he, uh, I let him ride it
for, like, two seconds,

1225
01:07:12,018 --> 01:07:15,998
and he just, he took off
and he just left and I was...

1226
01:07:16,022 --> 01:07:18,983
What did I tell you
about that, man?

1227
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:20,980
Didn't I tell you don't never
let another man

1228
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,008
make you feel like this?

1229
01:07:23,013 --> 01:07:24,988
Not even if it's me.

1230
01:07:25,012 --> 01:07:27,991
You come in here stuttering,
with your head down.

1231
01:07:28,015 --> 01:07:29,987
Men don't act like that.

1232
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:32,990
You sure you even ready
for this shit?

1233
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:34,993
I ain't got time to keep
twisting your arm around.

1234
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:37,003
I got shit to do.

1235
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:40,008
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

1236
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:42,005
Yeah.

1237
01:07:47,003 --> 01:07:49,016
You on clean-up duty
from now on, man.

1238
01:07:51,009 --> 01:07:52,289
If you don't get
this shit right,

1239
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:53,997
we ain't gettin' back
to what we're supposed to.

1240
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:55,987
You do what you gotta do,
then maybe we could

1241
01:07:56,011 --> 01:07:58,002
get back to what we was doin'.

1242
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:00,013
Maybe.

1243
01:08:10,011 --> 01:08:12,999
- Cheap ass.
- What you doin' after this?

1244
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:15,989
Me? Finna get
two girls this year.

1245
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:17,981
One in seventh, one in eighth.

1246
01:08:18,005 --> 01:08:19,981
Play it right, they won't even
know about each other, yo.

1247
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:21,990
Fuck you talkin' about?

1248
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,998
You already got two.
Leftquisha and Rightina.

1249
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,994
Shut your ass up, yo.
You always gangin' up on me.

1250
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:29,990
I only use my right.

1251
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:54,020
Yo.

1252
01:08:58,015 --> 01:09:00,007
Not your fat ass.

1253
01:09:09,008 --> 01:09:11,013
- What's up?
- What they call you?

1254
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:13,989
Lamont.

1255
01:09:14,013 --> 01:09:16,980
You went hard
on that bitch-ass nigga
that took your bike.

1256
01:09:17,004 --> 01:09:17,999
Yeah, that shit had me
trippin', for real.

1257
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:21,982
Yeah? I thought
you was gonna kill him.

1258
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:23,987
You stopped me.

1259
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:25,998
Bluffin'-ass li'l nigga.

1260
01:09:26,022 --> 01:09:28,011
You trying to get some money?

1261
01:09:29,016 --> 01:09:30,978
What are you lookin' back for?

1262
01:09:31,002 --> 01:09:32,442
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

1263
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:34,022
Yeah.

1264
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,998
I don't really be fucking
with kids,

1265
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:38,003
but I'mma holler at you.

1266
01:09:59,004 --> 01:10:00,006
Ma.

1267
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,005
- Ma.
- Uh-huh.

1268
01:10:16,019 --> 01:10:18,016
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

1269
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:24,978
- Don't you got class?
- Uh...

1270
01:10:25,002 --> 01:10:26,996
I'm gonna take
a little break from school.

1271
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,011
Pick up some extra hours.

1272
01:10:31,005 --> 01:10:32,992
Dr. Parish called.

1273
01:10:33,016 --> 01:10:36,011
Said she ain't seen you
in a month of Sundays.

1274
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:38,015
You quit on her?

1275
01:10:41,009 --> 01:10:42,018
That's what she think.

1276
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,986
You love animals, baby.

1277
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,990
You been saying
how you was gonna be a vet

1278
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:53,020
since your little ass
could talk.

1279
01:10:56,007 --> 01:10:57,008
What's going on?

1280
01:10:59,014 --> 01:11:00,017
Um...

1281
01:11:03,006 --> 01:11:04,982
A'ight.

1282
01:11:05,006 --> 01:11:06,994
I ain't gonna nag you
about it now.

1283
01:11:07,018 --> 01:11:11,986
If you wanna quit a job, quit.
Lord knows how many I have.

1284
01:11:14,022 --> 01:11:17,009
But don't give up
on your dreams, Mouse.

1285
01:11:19,006 --> 01:11:21,018
'Cause they don't get
no easier to hold on to.

1286
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:24,023
You hear me?

1287
01:11:28,006 --> 01:11:29,010
Promise me.

1288
01:11:31,019 --> 01:11:32,021
I promise.

1289
01:11:41,019 --> 01:11:43,018
I gotta get ready to go to work.

1290
01:11:46,003 --> 01:11:47,012
I'll see you tonight.

1291
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:32,005
What's up, Mouse? You ready
to get back to your bike?

1292
01:12:33,008 --> 01:12:35,023
I see you been workin' hard.

1293
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:38,009
Feel like you learned
your lesson by now.

1294
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,981
What?

1295
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:44,019
What's the matter?
I thought you wanted this.

1296
01:12:46,016 --> 01:12:47,021
I do.

1297
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:51,999
I need more than a bike, man.

1298
01:12:52,023 --> 01:12:55,988
I quit my job to work here,
and that's money I don't have.

1299
01:12:56,012 --> 01:12:57,992
It's money my family could use.

1300
01:12:58,016 --> 01:13:01,013
I don't know what
you talkin' about.
I got bikes for you, Mouse.

1301
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:06,015
Put me on.

1302
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:08,991
Put you on what?

1303
01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:11,993
You see me workin' here?
It look like they hirin'?

1304
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:14,990
But Jamal is.

1305
01:13:15,014 --> 01:13:18,988
Don't act like
you ain't gettin' money
with him. I seen it.

1306
01:13:19,012 --> 01:13:20,995
Put me on, man, I'm asking
for your help.

1307
01:13:21,019 --> 01:13:23,002
Fuck, no.

1308
01:13:28,014 --> 01:13:29,014
No?

1309
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:31,010
No.

1310
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,999
Then what the fuck
am I doin' here?

1311
01:13:34,023 --> 01:13:37,018
What am I doin' here? Huh?

1312
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:40,989
You better watch
who the fuck you talkin' to.

1313
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:41,998
You forgot
who you talkin' to, man?

1314
01:13:42,022 --> 01:13:44,995
I know exactly
who I'm talkin' to.

1315
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:46,979
I know exactly
who I'm talkin' to.

1316
01:13:47,003 --> 01:13:47,990
I'm talkin' to
an ex-con mechanic

1317
01:13:48,014 --> 01:13:50,004
who think he still run shit.

1318
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:52,985
Man, fuck this place!

1319
01:13:53,009 --> 01:13:54,979
I mean,
fuck this half-built bike

1320
01:13:55,003 --> 01:13:56,985
and fuck you, too, Blax!

1321
01:13:57,009 --> 01:13:58,997
I thought you was down for me.

1322
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:00,023
I am.

1323
01:14:01,014 --> 01:14:02,019
Then prove it.

1324
01:14:03,017 --> 01:14:06,003
Put me on.

1325
01:14:07,011 --> 01:14:08,011
No.

1326
01:14:18,002 --> 01:14:19,162
Hey, yo, Mouse.

1327
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:21,993
My nigga.

1328
01:14:22,017 --> 01:14:23,978
What up?

1329
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:28,992
These are my niggas.

1330
01:14:29,016 --> 01:14:31,012
Blax let you off the leash, huh?

1331
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,007

You wouldn't know it.
It came out this century.

1345
01:15:17,002 --> 01:15:17,988
You headed to the clinic?

1346
01:15:18,012 --> 01:15:18,997
I can run you over there
real quick.

1347
01:15:19,021 --> 01:15:20,989
Nah, I'm not.

1348
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:22,998
You not going
to see Blax, are you?

1349
01:15:23,022 --> 01:15:26,985
- No, I'm not.
- Well, that's good.

1350
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:29,129
Well, don't leave me
in suspense, man.
Where you goin'?

1351
01:15:32,014 --> 01:15:34,986
Why you think that's any
of your damn business, huh?

1352
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,987
- Mouse.
- Nah. Nah, for real.

1353
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,983
Why you think you can
just roll up on me

1354
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:40,990
any time of the fuckin' day

1355
01:15:41,014 --> 01:15:42,984
and just ask me
all these questions?

1356
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:46,003
And I gotta tell you everything
that's goin' on in my life.

1357
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:47,993
Hmm?

1358
01:15:48,017 --> 01:15:49,996
I mean, you came
into my school
a few months back

1359
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,006
when I was, like, what, 10?

1360
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:53,994
Hmm?

1361
01:15:54,018 --> 01:15:56,982
That wasn't supposed to be
no lifelong commitment.
Move on.

1362
01:15:57,006 --> 01:15:57,996
- Oh, it's like that?
- It's been like that.

1363
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,023
- It's like that, Mouse?
- It's been like that.

1364
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:03,013
You just can't take a hint.
That's your problem.

1365
01:16:07,006 --> 01:16:08,997
Hey. Mouse.

1366
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:11,987
Hey, look, you ain't
gotta like it, but oh, well.

1367
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:13,981
I'm gonna keep
being here for you

1368
01:16:14,005 --> 01:16:15,995
and one day you gonna look back
and you gonna think about me

1369
01:16:16,019 --> 01:16:17,983
and you gonna be glad that
somebody had...

1370
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:20,001
- What is it with you, bro?
- What you mean?

1371
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:23,986
Is you gay?

1372
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,991
You like touching
on little kids or somethin'?

1373
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:27,979
Or is it that you feelin' guilty

1374
01:16:28,003 --> 01:16:28,991
about all the little niggas
you done locked up

1375
01:16:29,015 --> 01:16:30,982
and put in a cage?

1376
01:16:31,006 --> 01:16:31,993
Whatever your fucking
problem is,

1377
01:16:32,017 --> 01:16:33,990
I ain't the solution.

1378
01:16:34,014 --> 01:16:35,997
I promise you I'm not.

1379
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:37,995
And for your information,

1380
01:16:38,019 --> 01:16:42,022
I don't need you.
I don't need anybody, but me.

1381
01:16:44,006 --> 01:16:45,008
Step!

1382
01:16:50,017 --> 01:16:52,004
You don't need me?

1383
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:55,010
Okay, big man.

1384
01:16:56,003 --> 01:16:57,003
A'ight.

1385
01:16:59,002 --> 01:16:59,998
<i>♪ I see your graves
Gettin' dug ♪</i>

1386
01:17:00,022 --> 01:17:02,988
<i>♪ If you fucks with my cut
What? Yeah, I said ♪</i>

1387
01:17:03,012 --> 01:17:04,012
Ay!

1388
01:17:05,006 --> 01:17:06,022
Shut the fuck up, bro.

1389
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,001
For two seconds, be serious.

1390
01:17:12,019 --> 01:17:14,023
- You think they got ice cream?
- Nigga, shut up.

1391
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:16,011
Or, like, candy or...

1392
01:17:25,022 --> 01:17:28,978
Y'all little niggas ready
to get down with the Clique?

1393
01:17:29,002 --> 01:17:31,009
Still fucking around
with these kids.

1394
01:17:39,011 --> 01:17:40,999
Y'all download what I told
y'all to download?

1395
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,982
Yeah, but what I'mma do
with a datin' app, man?

1396
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:45,983
I do be gettin'
hella girls, though.

1397
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,996
Man, shut the fuck up
and listen.

1398
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,014
Take out y'all phones.

1399
01:17:51,001 --> 01:17:52,004
Find me.

1400
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,010
Swipe right.

1401
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:56,999
Y'all think these dumbass police

1402
01:17:57,023 --> 01:17:59,987
gonna be lookin'
for a conspiracy
in a datin' app?

1403
01:18:00,011 --> 01:18:00,996
Really?

1404
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,980
<i>Keep your phone on you
at all times.</i>

1405
01:18:04,004 --> 01:18:05,984
<i>Don't put that shit
on silent, ever.</i>

1406
01:18:06,008 --> 01:18:09,991
<i>I'mma hit you on there.
Tell you where to meet at.</i>

1407
01:18:10,015 --> 01:18:12,022
<i>You got 20 minutes to get there.</i>

1408
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,981
<i>It ain't never gonna be
the same place twice.</i>

1409
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:18,998
<i>You gonna be gettin'
a specific order that day.</i>

1410
01:18:19,022 --> 01:18:21,982
<i>You pick up the bag
from my man inside.</i>

1411
01:18:22,006 --> 01:18:23,988
<i>Listen, don't open that bag.</i>

1412
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:28,023
Just put it in this bag.
Don't even fuckin' look in it.

1413
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,996
<i>Take it to the second spot.
Just give them the bag.</i>

1414
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:34,998
<i>They gonna hit me
and let me know they got it.</i>

1415
01:18:35,022 --> 01:18:37,022
<i>They gonna give you another bag.</i>

1416
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:41,997
<i>Don't open that one, neither.</i>

1417
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:45,006
- Where they asses?
<i>- Just bring it back to me.</i>

1418
01:18:46,005 --> 01:18:47,990
<i>Do exactly what I say,</i>

1419
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:50,005
<i>then you gonna get paid.</i>

1420
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:54,020
<i>Shit, you might fuck around
and get rich.</i>

1421
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:57,980
<i>This light work y'all are doing.</i>

1422
01:18:58,004 --> 01:19:00,022
<i>Y'all little niggas can't ride
with the Clique.</i>

1423
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,993
You ain't shit but cheap labor.

1424
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:04,984
Man, it take more
than that to be M.N.C.

1425
01:19:05,008 --> 01:19:06,989
<i>Until I say otherwise,
anything I give you,</i>

1426
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:09,010
<i>I could take the fuck back.</i>

1427
01:19:10,008 --> 01:19:10,993
Mouse.

1428
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:12,991
<i>Don't mention shit to nobody.</i>

1429
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,022
What?

1430
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:15,986
Ain't you forgettin' somethin'?

1431
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,998
Can't fuckin' do that
right now, Shay.

1432
01:19:18,022 --> 01:19:20,992
<i>You get hemmed up,
you on your own.</i>

1433
01:19:21,016 --> 01:19:21,999
Got any questions, ask now

1434
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,021
'cause I ain't sayin'
shit twice.

1435
01:19:27,023 --> 01:19:28,993
Speak the fuck up.

1436
01:19:29,017 --> 01:19:30,988
Um...

1437
01:19:31,012 --> 01:19:33,006
When we gonna get our bikes?

1438
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,989
Hey, I could put you on my own.

1439
01:19:42,013 --> 01:19:43,988
Look at this,
he think he smooth.

1440
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:44,995
This nigga always think
you got the sauce, man.

1441
01:19:45,019 --> 01:19:46,982
Baby-ass bike.

1442
01:19:47,006 --> 01:19:48,979
What y'all goofy-ass niggas
talkin' about, bro?

1443
01:19:49,003 --> 01:19:50,986
My bike is the best one
out of all of us, bro.

1444
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,985
- Out of all of us.
- This that big stuff.

1445
01:19:53,009 --> 01:19:54,976
- I got that muscle right here.
- Come on, nigga.

1446
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,980
Bro, I picked my shit first,
how about that?

1447
01:19:57,004 --> 01:19:58,005
Ay! Ay, Nicki.

1448
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,021
Hey, guys.

1449
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,988
- 'Sup, Nicki?
- What's up?

1450
01:20:06,012 --> 01:20:09,005
You okay? Haven't been
answering my calls.

1451
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,013
Nice camera.

1452
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:15,020
I'm good.

1453
01:20:16,023 --> 01:20:18,980
I been busy.

1454
01:20:19,004 --> 01:20:20,993
Yeah, well, I printed
a few pictures of you.

1455
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:23,005
Thought you might like this one.

1456
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:29,982
Thanks.

1457
01:20:30,006 --> 01:20:30,999
My grandma's gonna be
gone all day.

1458
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:33,987
Had to visit a cousin in D.C.
or somethin'.

1459
01:20:34,011 --> 01:20:35,051
We could go catch a movie.

1460
01:20:37,011 --> 01:20:37,997
Shit. But you know, actually,

1461
01:20:38,021 --> 01:20:40,996
like I was sayin',
we kinda busy.

1462
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,987
So, it's...

1463
01:20:43,011 --> 01:20:44,012
You're busy?

1464
01:20:45,018 --> 01:20:47,009
Yeah, busy.

1465
01:20:48,018 --> 01:20:49,992
Who are these people?

1466
01:20:50,016 --> 01:20:52,988
These are my friends
from school.

1467
01:20:53,012 --> 01:20:55,007
And they live here year-round.

1468
01:20:59,023 --> 01:21:01,998
You know what? I was actually
finna get going anyway.

1469
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:04,001
Mouse.

1470
01:21:05,004 --> 01:21:06,978
You'll wait for me,
though, right?

1471
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:08,002
Let's go, Mouse.

1472
01:21:16,018 --> 01:21:17,992
Look, I know that was messed up,

1473
01:21:18,016 --> 01:21:19,980
but if you wanna go
to the movies,

1474
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:21,084
- I can take you.
- Shut up.

1475
01:21:39,021 --> 01:21:41,007
Where you get all of this?

1476
01:21:42,009 --> 01:21:43,012
What is this?

1477
01:21:44,021 --> 01:21:45,997
Why are you going
through my stuff?

1478
01:21:46,021 --> 01:21:49,000
I ain't gonna ask you again.

1479
01:21:50,021 --> 01:21:51,997
It's money.

1480
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:54,015
Little boy, don't play with me.

1481
01:21:57,001 --> 01:21:58,041
Where you get all of this?

1482
01:21:59,016 --> 01:22:00,023
Huh?

1483
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:01,986
Vet don't pay that much,

1484
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:04,017
and hell, you ain't been
going there no way.

1485
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:08,013
I earned it.

1486
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:10,992
- How?
- Working.

1487
01:22:11,016 --> 01:22:13,012
Workin' for who?

1488
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:14,997
Some dudes.

1489
01:22:15,021 --> 01:22:16,994
What fuckin' dudes, Myron?

1490
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:19,020
Some dudes I been
ridin' bikes with.

1491
01:22:34,013 --> 01:22:36,981
I done lost one of my sons
to these fuckin' streets

1492
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:37,998
and if you think
I'm finna lose another one

1493
01:22:38,022 --> 01:22:41,019
it ain't gonna be while you up
under this fuckin' roof!

1494
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:43,995
You know what?

1495
01:22:44,019 --> 01:22:47,991
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out my house.

1496
01:22:48,015 --> 01:22:48,996
Get the fuck out, Myron.

1497
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,982
Where the fuck
you want me to go?

1498
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:51,993
Where the fuck
you think you gonna go?

1499
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:54,978
You a grown-ass man now, right?

1500
01:22:55,002 --> 01:22:57,985
You a grown-ass
fuckin' man now, right?

1501
01:22:58,009 --> 01:22:59,983
What the fuck
I look like takin' care

1502
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,979
of a grown-ass fuckin' man?

1503
01:23:02,003 --> 01:23:02,983
You gettin' money,

1504
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:05,979
get the fuck out
and figure it out!

1505
01:23:06,003 --> 01:23:06,991
Figure this shit out, Myron!

1506
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:09,015
I ain't fuckin'
playin' with you!

1507
01:23:19,011 --> 01:23:20,989
Myron!

1508
01:23:21,013 --> 01:23:23,983
All the shit
I've done for you, boy.

1509
01:23:24,007 --> 01:23:26,985
This the shit you gonna do.

1510
01:23:27,009 --> 01:23:30,023
All the fuckin' shit
I have done for you.

1511
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:34,010
You know what it took me to...
Fuckin' shit!

1512
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:38,023
Shit!

1513
01:24:14,011 --> 01:24:15,011
Yo, Sophie.

1514
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:21,002
M.N.C. Blax.

1515
01:24:22,019 --> 01:24:23,984
Detective Rivers.

1516
01:24:24,008 --> 01:24:25,994
I just came through
to check you out.

1517
01:24:26,018 --> 01:24:29,007
It's not a official visit.
Your P.O. didn't send me.

1518
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:33,000
It don't matter,
'cause I ain't dirty anyway.

1519
01:24:34,013 --> 01:24:36,981
That's good, brother,
that's good.

1520
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,286
Finally gettin'
yourself together
after all this time, huh?

1521
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:41,978
And after all of this time,
you still runnin' around here

1522
01:24:42,002 --> 01:24:43,562
acting like you better
than niggas, huh?

1523
01:24:44,019 --> 01:24:45,994
Shit don't change, huh?

1524
01:24:46,018 --> 01:24:47,997
We closed, so what's up?

1525
01:24:48,021 --> 01:24:51,986
You know, they used
to have this program
called BPD Buddies.

1526
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:54,989
It got cut a few years back.
Budget constraints.

1527
01:24:55,013 --> 01:24:56,293
But what it was, it allowed cops

1528
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:59,006
to go inside of schools
and be a mentor.

1529
01:25:00,002 --> 01:25:01,011
Mine was Mouse.

1530
01:25:03,012 --> 01:25:05,004
I mean, this little boy, man.

1531
01:25:07,004 --> 01:25:08,993
This little boy blew me away.

1532
01:25:09,017 --> 01:25:12,979
I mean, anything that you
wanted to know about an animal,

1533
01:25:13,003 --> 01:25:14,987
whether it was
the life expectancy of a frog

1534
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:15,998
or the diet of an arctic fox,

1535
01:25:16,022 --> 01:25:17,988
I mean, he could just recall it

1536
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,988
from his memory just like that.

1537
01:25:20,012 --> 01:25:23,004
I probably learned more
from him than he learned
from me.

1538
01:25:24,022 --> 01:25:26,994
The more we got
to know each other,

1539
01:25:27,018 --> 01:25:30,021
the more I got to know
what he's been through.

1540
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,120
How his brother died in that
police raid and all that.

1541
01:25:34,019 --> 01:25:36,012
That's tragic stuff, brother.

1542
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:39,984
So, I started digging.

1543
01:25:40,008 --> 01:25:42,005
And guess whose name came up?

1544
01:25:43,023 --> 01:25:45,001
You.

1545
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:46,999
Bryan Tarver.

1546
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:49,989
And I said to myself, I said,
"Man, I know this guy.

1547
01:25:50,013 --> 01:25:54,983
Bryan, Bryan. Yeah!
Bryan from the West Side.

1548
01:25:55,007 --> 01:25:56,985
Grew up on the same block. Yeah.

1549
01:25:57,009 --> 01:25:57,991
Little big-head-ass Bryan,

1550
01:25:58,015 --> 01:25:59,980
used to follow
behind us and shit.

1551
01:26:00,004 --> 01:26:00,997
Yeah, I know him.

1552
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:02,995
Turned out to be
one cold-hearted brother,

1553
01:26:03,019 --> 01:26:05,995
but yeah, I know him."

1554
01:26:06,019 --> 01:26:08,023
Man, nigga, you don't
fuckin' know me.

1555
01:26:09,014 --> 01:26:10,021
Maybe you right.

1556
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,002
I thought I did.

1557
01:26:15,006 --> 01:26:17,982
But I had no idea how cold

1558
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:21,014
- M.N.C. Blax really was.
- Nigga, you don't know shit.

1559
01:26:24,007 --> 01:26:26,984
I know when we found Stro,
he had, like, what?

1560
01:26:27,008 --> 01:26:28,978
800, 900 on him.

1561
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:29,996
And what kid you know
from West Baltimore

1562
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,978
got that kinda cash on him
unless he trappin'?

1563
01:26:33,002 --> 01:26:33,999
Stro don't trap.

1564
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,012
I was lookin' out for Stro.

1565
01:26:39,017 --> 01:26:41,013
Well, you did a hell of a job.

1566
01:26:44,008 --> 01:26:46,020
No matter how
you cut it, Bryan...

1567
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,021
this on you, ain't it?

1568
01:26:50,021 --> 01:26:52,022
Ain't none
of your fucking business.

1569
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,994
Now what else you want?

1570
01:26:54,018 --> 01:26:56,418
I wanna make sure
that the same thing
doesn't happen to Mouse.

1571
01:26:57,001 --> 01:26:58,977
I wanna make sure that
the same thing doesn't happen

1572
01:26:59,001 --> 01:26:59,993
to any of these
other young Black boys

1573
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:01,995
followin' your ass
down the same road.

1574
01:27:02,019 --> 01:27:04,996
I know you ain't just said
what I think you said.

1575
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:09,000
Black boys?
What about Black boys?

1576
01:27:10,002 --> 01:27:11,994
You don't give a fuck
about Black boys.

1577
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,988
Matter of fact, you ain't even
Black no more, nigga. You blue.

1578
01:27:16,012 --> 01:27:17,022
Bitch-ass nigga.

1579
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,998
That's why Mouse
don't wanna be
around you now.

1580
01:27:19,022 --> 01:27:21,011
Fuckin' joke.

1581
01:27:22,021 --> 01:27:23,978
He know I'm the only nigga

1582
01:27:24,002 --> 01:27:25,984
around here that care about him.

1583
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,989
Only nigga around here
that ain't on a payroll

1584
01:27:28,013 --> 01:27:30,010
to act like he care about him.

1585
01:27:32,023 --> 01:27:34,016
Ah. Okay.

1586
01:27:36,015 --> 01:27:38,990
You and I both know...

1587
01:27:39,014 --> 01:27:40,986
that the best thing
that could ever happen to Mouse

1588
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:44,001
is for a nigga like you
to be out of his life forever.

1589
01:27:46,021 --> 01:27:48,023
Let me ask you somethin', Blax.

1590
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:50,015
Bryan.

1591
01:27:53,019 --> 01:27:55,020
Does Mouse know
what really happened to Stro?

1592
01:28:01,002 --> 01:28:02,005
Figures.

1593
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:13,992
Oh, Mouse, if you
gonna be stayin' at my house,

1594
01:28:14,016 --> 01:28:15,998
don't be using
my toothbrush, a'ight?

1595
01:28:16,022 --> 01:28:17,995
That shit's nasty, yo.

1596
01:28:18,019 --> 01:28:19,987
Yeah, whatever, yo.

1597
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:21,997
I'm tellin' you, nigga,
these are O.G.

1598
01:28:22,021 --> 01:28:24,997
Nigga, these are better
than those, though.

1599
01:28:25,021 --> 01:28:26,995
- Here we go.
- I'm tellin' you, yo.

1600
01:28:27,019 --> 01:28:29,987
- This is the best shit ever.
- They're not even
made the same, yo.

1601
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:30,997
Yes, they are.

1602
01:28:31,021 --> 01:28:32,901
- What're you talkin' about, yo?
- No, they not.

1603
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,984
They way different textures.

1604
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:35,978
No, they're not.
They're both gummy.

1605
01:28:36,002 --> 01:28:36,995
- They're literally both gummy.
- Those are Sour Patch Kids.

1606
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:38,990
- These are gummy bears.
- But they're both gummies.

1607
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,982
- Hey, yo. Jamal
was right about us.
- They're sour.

1608
01:28:41,006 --> 01:28:42,982
- Fuck you talkin' about?
- Here we go.

1609
01:28:43,006 --> 01:28:45,988
He was right about us, a'ight?

1610
01:28:46,012 --> 01:28:47,998
We doin' the same shit
we always used to do.

1611
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,994
We just sittin' on
some borrowed bikes.

1612
01:28:50,018 --> 01:28:53,989
Hey, nigga.
I love my borrowed bike.

1613
01:28:54,013 --> 01:28:56,979
Oh, yeah? What happens
if you wreck it?

1614
01:28:57,003 --> 01:28:59,982
What you think Jamal gonna say?
What you think Jamal gonna do?

1615
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:00,997
Forgive and forget?

1616
01:29:01,021 --> 01:29:03,995
Take a couple
thousand dollar loss
and just move on?

1617
01:29:04,019 --> 01:29:05,996
I mean, seriously,
did y'all even think about

1618
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:07,994
the deal we took
when we got these bikes?

1619
01:29:08,018 --> 01:29:10,996
- Nigga, did you?
- Yes. And I am now.

1620
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:13,022
So what would you like us
to do, then, Mouse?

1621
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,992
Make our own money.
Get our own bike.

1622
01:29:16,016 --> 01:29:18,022
That's the kinda shit
we need to be on, yo.

1623
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:23,022
Ay, look, it's like this.

1624
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,992
As long as we keep
holdin' our hands out,

1625
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,993
we always gonna be seen
as some little kids.

1626
01:29:29,017 --> 01:29:30,997
And I don't know about y'all,
but I'm sick and tired

1627
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:33,017
of grown folks runnin' my life.

1628
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:38,020
Boys wait for other people.
Men go out and get it.

1629
01:29:39,013 --> 01:29:40,998
I'm tryin' to go get it.

1630
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:43,995
How the fuck
we supposed to do that, Mouse?

1631
01:29:44,019 --> 01:29:45,023
Huh?

1632
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:49,019
We can just rob
that motherfucker right there.

1633
01:29:54,005 --> 01:29:56,986
- Is you high?
- Nah, think about it.

1634
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:58,986
We'll get the props we need

1635
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,994
for actually doin' something.
Something real.

1636
01:30:02,018 --> 01:30:04,981
And we can get the cash
to get all our bikes.

1637
01:30:05,005 --> 01:30:06,013
It's a win-win.

1638
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,983
Yeah.

1639
01:30:09,007 --> 01:30:10,022
Yeah, it'd be easy.

1640
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,981
Old man Kim ain't gonna
put up no fight.

1641
01:30:13,005 --> 01:30:13,988
We get in, we get out,

1642
01:30:14,012 --> 01:30:15,983
we get the cash,
we get our own bikes.

1643
01:30:16,007 --> 01:30:19,981
And we prove to Jamal
we down for whatever.

1644
01:30:20,005 --> 01:30:21,995
And we get to fuck
with them racist ass.

1645
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:23,982
Yeah.

1646
01:30:24,006 --> 01:30:25,981
Y'all do know this,
that's a real crime, right?

1647
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,990
Jail time. Doin' our nickel.
Don't drop the soap, like...

1648
01:30:29,014 --> 01:30:31,978
The fuck you think
we've been doin' for Jamal?

1649
01:30:32,002 --> 01:30:33,011
Delivering pizzas?

1650
01:30:37,003 --> 01:30:38,023
Let's go get it.

1651
01:30:40,015 --> 01:30:40,997
I don't know.

1652
01:30:41,021 --> 01:30:42,988
Y'all know
y'all still babies, right?

1653
01:30:43,012 --> 01:30:43,998
- We know we ready, Queen.
- What we tryin' to tell you

1654
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,991
is we ain't
no fuckin' babies, bro.

1655
01:30:46,015 --> 01:30:47,023
Yo, Jamal.

1656
01:30:48,022 --> 01:30:51,018
J! Come here, right fast.

1657
01:30:53,006 --> 01:30:54,009
Hold up, yo.

1658
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:55,990
Yeah?

1659
01:30:56,014 --> 01:30:58,006
J, they tryin' to tool up.

1660
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Say what?

1661
01:31:01,006 --> 01:31:02,016
Say they need a strap.

1662
01:31:03,016 --> 01:31:04,980
Give 'em one.

1663
01:31:05,004 --> 01:31:06,010
One, though.

1664
01:31:13,019 --> 01:31:14,983
Yo, Queen.

1665
01:31:15,007 --> 01:31:16,167
Give it to that little nigga.

1666
01:31:18,002 --> 01:31:19,008
You bet.

1667
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:22,010
Man, come on.

1668
01:31:31,002 --> 01:31:32,984
Whoo... Pay up.

1669
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:34,021
Yeah. Pay.

1670
01:31:37,022 --> 01:31:39,006
Yo!

1671
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:45,015
Hey, yo.

1672
01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:47,978
Let me holler at you, yo.

1673
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,022
Yo, what's up?

1674
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,680
You makin' it hot out here.
What you doin'?

1675
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,983
I see you
holdin' court out here.

1676
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,984
Yeah, it's the shit
you taught me.

1677
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,006
Keep the money
and the work separate.

1678
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,984
What's the problem?
Nigga, I'm on parole.

1679
01:32:01,008 --> 01:32:03,022
You know if the cops
come up in here, I'm done.

1680
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,040
All right. We gonna chill.

1681
01:32:07,008 --> 01:32:08,996
I'll let niggas know
we can't be ridin' here.

1682
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,023
Cool? What else?

1683
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,991
- Fall back off Mouse.
- No.

1684
01:32:15,015 --> 01:32:16,989
That little nigga a trapper.

1685
01:32:17,013 --> 01:32:18,988
Gotta keep him around, he good.

1686
01:32:19,012 --> 01:32:20,015
Just like Stro.

1687
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,013
Fall back off Mouse, nigga.

1688
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,991
Yeah, whatever.

1689
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:27,981
Tell that little nigga
to bring my shit back

1690
01:32:28,005 --> 01:32:29,285
and go ahead about his business.

1691
01:32:30,001 --> 01:32:32,985
Oh, yeah,
and if you still tryin'
to save the youth and shit...

1692
01:32:33,009 --> 01:32:34,981
he came asking for a piece.

1693
01:32:35,005 --> 01:32:36,996
And you fuckin' gave it to him.

1694
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,983
Pretty sure
I was around the same age

1695
01:32:39,007 --> 01:32:41,006
when you gave me
my first strap, nigga.

1696
01:32:57,006 --> 01:32:59,002
- I didn't contribute that.
- Yeah.

1697
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:05,984
Oh, my bad.

1698
01:33:06,008 --> 01:33:08,608
- Well, what's up?
- -Well, that was messed up.

1699
01:33:14,022 --> 01:33:15,994
Don't even do that.

1700
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:29,010
Hey, yo, I gotta go.

1701
01:33:30,022 --> 01:33:32,012
Ay, you hear me talkin' to you?

1702
01:33:33,015 --> 01:33:35,983
I gotta go. Blax texted me.

1703
01:33:36,007 --> 01:33:36,990
- A'ight.
- All right.

1704
01:33:37,014 --> 01:33:38,214
Yo, text me when you get back.

1705
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,021
Yo.

1706
01:33:59,023 --> 01:34:01,006
I need to holler at you.

1707
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,018
I'm here.

1708
01:34:06,008 --> 01:34:08,007
You know I know
what you been up to, right?

1709
01:34:11,005 --> 01:34:11,997
So?

1710
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,992
- "So"? What the fuck
you mean, "so"?

1711
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,986
You not even built like that.
I don't even know why...

1712
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:17,010
Mouse!

1713
01:34:19,007 --> 01:34:20,008
Ay.

1714
01:34:21,012 --> 01:34:21,995
Ay, what's wrong with Sophie?

1715
01:34:22,019 --> 01:34:23,983
I don't know
what's wrong with Sophie.

1716
01:34:24,007 --> 01:34:25,983
- What the fuck is wrong
with you?
- Ay.

1717
01:34:26,007 --> 01:34:28,995
Listen to me,
something's wrong with her.
You got your car here?

1718
01:34:29,019 --> 01:34:31,020
What you mean,
there's something wrong
with Sophie?

1719
01:34:34,004 --> 01:34:35,364
- Right here.
- Well, come on, man.

1720
01:34:55,016 --> 01:34:58,000
Have you noticed any change
in behavior recently?

1721
01:34:59,010 --> 01:34:59,992
She been, like,

1722
01:35:00,016 --> 01:35:01,978
moving a little slow

1723
01:35:02,002 --> 01:35:03,986
and like not eating
as much as she usually eat

1724
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:07,003
but she get like that sometimes.

1725
01:35:12,015 --> 01:35:13,989
You think it might be bloat?

1726
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:16,990
What's that? What's bloat?

1727
01:35:17,014 --> 01:35:22,010
It's, uh, actually
called gastric dilatation...

1728
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:24,986
Vol...

1729
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,016
- Volvulus.
- Volvulus.

1730
01:35:28,015 --> 01:35:29,986
It's a gas build-up.

1731
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:32,993
Blockage, it makes
the stomach twist up
on itself.

1732
01:35:33,017 --> 01:35:35,010
And that's
supposed to be serious?

1733
01:35:38,009 --> 01:35:39,089
So, what we supposed to do?

1734
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:45,997
Well, surgery
is certainly an option.

1735
01:35:46,021 --> 01:35:49,017
But with a dog of this age...

1736
01:35:52,013 --> 01:35:55,005
Well, what you trying to say?
We gotta, like, put her down?

1737
01:35:58,013 --> 01:36:00,989
Well, that's 100% up to you.

1738
01:36:01,013 --> 01:36:02,984
We can operate
as early as tomorrow morning

1739
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:05,003
if that's the route
you wanna go.

1740
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:07,986
But, honestly...

1741
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:11,009
that's a lot
for this little girl to take.

1742
01:36:25,015 --> 01:36:26,023
Mouse gonna do it.

1743
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,000
Um...

1744
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:34,000
I got you.

1745
01:36:36,013 --> 01:36:36,998
Okay.

1746
01:36:37,022 --> 01:36:39,021
I'm gonna
walk you through it,
all right?

1747
01:36:42,009 --> 01:36:43,985
All right, keep your hand
really steady, okay?

1748
01:36:44,009 --> 01:36:46,994
We're gonna find
the major artery
in the back of this front leg.

1749
01:36:47,018 --> 01:36:49,983
Just go ahead
and feel around for it.

1750
01:36:50,007 --> 01:36:51,984
Right there, do you feel that?

1751
01:36:52,008 --> 01:36:53,987
Just put the needle
directly into it, okay?

1752
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:20,050
I'll leave you guys to it.

1753
01:37:30,015 --> 01:37:31,993
You remember I told you

1754
01:37:32,017 --> 01:37:34,990
your brother was,
like, no good at choosin'

1755
01:37:35,014 --> 01:37:36,017
who he hung around?

1756
01:37:37,012 --> 01:37:38,013
Yeah.

1757
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,019
I was talkin'
about niggas like me.

1758
01:37:44,002 --> 01:37:45,996
He should've
avoided niggas like me.

1759
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,008
Wait, what you talkin' about?

1760
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:51,009
He called me...

1761
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,992
and he kept tellin' me
how he needed money

1762
01:37:55,016 --> 01:37:56,989
and how the lights went out

1763
01:37:57,013 --> 01:37:58,999
for the second time.

1764
01:37:59,023 --> 01:38:01,018
So I sent him to do a run.

1765
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:05,011
He ain't never make it back
from that run.

1766
01:38:07,015 --> 01:38:09,015
It's my fault your brother died.

1767
01:38:12,009 --> 01:38:13,016
I put him on.

1768
01:38:16,018 --> 01:38:19,980
And I only took you
under the wing
'cause I felt like...

1769
01:38:20,004 --> 01:38:21,994
this would be the only thing
I could do

1770
01:38:22,018 --> 01:38:24,011
to feel like I'm doin' right.

1771
01:38:27,005 --> 01:38:28,006
Mouse.

1772
01:38:30,006 --> 01:38:31,011
Yo, Mouse.

1773
01:39:18,008 --> 01:39:19,008
Got it?

1774
01:39:22,012 --> 01:39:23,986
What if
he fixed the cameras, ay?

1775
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:26,990
You think he just so happened
to fix 'em
the night we rob him?

1776
01:39:27,014 --> 01:39:28,986
Besides,
all these engines, nigga,

1777
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,979
you ain't gonna hear
no shootin'.

1778
01:39:31,003 --> 01:39:31,990
Nigga, there ain't gonna be
no shootin'.

1779
01:39:32,014 --> 01:39:33,981
I'm just sayin' if shit go left.

1780
01:39:34,005 --> 01:39:35,999
No. We get in, we get out.

1781
01:39:36,023 --> 01:39:38,015
We get the money, we leave.

1782
01:39:41,015 --> 01:39:42,022
No shooting.

1783
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,023
Lamont, I'm serious.

1784
01:39:44,001 --> 01:39:44,984
Nigga, I'm serious.

1785
01:39:45,008 --> 01:39:47,003
Stop being so damn scary.

1786
01:39:48,007 --> 01:39:48,985
Fuck.

1787
01:39:49,009 --> 01:39:49,995
Man, nigga, you know what?

1788
01:39:50,019 --> 01:39:52,023
- Fuck that shit.
- Fuck are you doin'? 'Mont.

1789
01:39:55,009 --> 01:39:56,009
'Mont!

1790
01:40:05,022 --> 01:40:08,007
Let them have their fun.
Everyone sit tight.

1791
01:41:20,008 --> 01:41:21,013
Ready?

1792
01:41:30,018 --> 01:41:33,015
<i>I wanna know
who killed my brother!</i>

1793
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,990
Hey, hey, hey...

1794
01:41:40,014 --> 01:41:41,978
Give me your money.

1795
01:41:42,002 --> 01:41:42,998
Get the money
right now. Right now!

1796
01:41:43,022 --> 01:41:45,994
Yo, I swear
to God, yo, I'mma
shoot your ass.

1797
01:41:46,018 --> 01:41:47,978
Give me the money right now.

1798
01:41:48,002 --> 01:41:48,986
I'm calling the police.

1799
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,978
Ay! Yo, yo, yo.
What is you doin'?

1800
01:41:51,002 --> 01:41:51,988
What are you doing?

1801
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:53,979
No, no, no.
Let's go back. Come on.

1802
01:41:54,003 --> 01:41:55,982
Hey, yo. It's bad, bro.
We gotta go.

1803
01:41:56,006 --> 01:41:57,981
- Give me the money.
- Lamont, leave him.
Let's go.

1804
01:41:58,005 --> 01:41:59,005
We gotta go!

1805
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:01,985
Let me go!

1806
01:42:03,018 --> 01:42:05,979
What the fuck?
I said no shooting!

1807
01:42:07,008 --> 01:42:08,488
Shit, gun!

1808
01:42:10,023 --> 01:42:11,989
What the fuck?

1809
01:42:43,019 --> 01:42:46,986
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1810
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:47,999
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Sweartagawd.

1811
01:42:48,023 --> 01:42:49,995
- We gotta go.
- Sweartagawd!

1812
01:42:50,019 --> 01:42:53,005
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Sweartagawd, get up!

1813
01:43:01,014 --> 01:43:02,214
<i>Shots fired.</i>

1814
01:43:03,001 --> 01:43:03,990
<i>There's a store robbery
in progress.</i>

1815
01:43:04,014 --> 01:43:07,978
Multiple suspects fleeing
from Clinton and Calhoun.

1816
01:43:08,002 --> 01:43:09,002
All right, I'm on it.

1817
01:43:17,008 --> 01:43:18,981
We gotta split up.

1818
01:43:19,005 --> 01:43:20,990
Lamont, no.
We should stay together.

1819
01:43:21,014 --> 01:43:21,992
Nah, too risky.

1820
01:43:22,016 --> 01:43:23,023
I'mma go find Jamal.

1821
01:43:24,001 --> 01:43:24,987
He'll know what to do.

1822
01:43:25,011 --> 01:43:25,998
Lamont!

1823
01:43:26,022 --> 01:43:27,990
Wait, 'Mont, come back.

1824
01:43:28,014 --> 01:43:30,011
Please. Lamont!

1825
01:44:13,009 --> 01:44:15,015
Miguel. You can take
a break, Miguel.

1826
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:21,007
You don't fuckin' hear me?
Take a break!

1827
01:44:24,006 --> 01:44:25,366
And lock the door
when you leavin'.

1828
01:44:36,004 --> 01:44:38,000
What happened to you?

1829
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:42,170
Tell me what happened, Mouse.

1830
01:44:45,005 --> 01:44:46,011
He's dead.

1831
01:44:47,003 --> 01:44:48,007
Who dead?

1832
01:44:51,012 --> 01:44:52,981
Sweartagawd got shot

1833
01:44:53,005 --> 01:44:53,993
- and now he's dead.
- Oh, God.

1834
01:44:54,017 --> 01:44:56,003
How'd he get shot? By who?

1835
01:44:57,003 --> 01:44:58,013
Mr. Kim's wife.

1836
01:44:59,023 --> 01:45:00,991
We didn't know she had a gun.

1837
01:45:01,015 --> 01:45:04,001
The fuck? Was y'all tryin'
to rob the store, Mouse?

1838
01:45:05,004 --> 01:45:05,992
We had a plan.

1839
01:45:06,016 --> 01:45:07,023
Oh, my fucking God.

1840
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:09,991
No shooting.

1841
01:45:10,015 --> 01:45:12,016
But then they shot, and we shot.

1842
01:45:13,019 --> 01:45:15,010
Shut up and let me think, man.

1843
01:45:26,011 --> 01:45:28,008
I need you to listen
to me, Mouse.

1844
01:45:32,003 --> 01:45:32,987
You wanna know
what a second chance

1845
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:35,004
feel like for people
like me and you?

1846
01:45:38,011 --> 01:45:41,006
Niggas like us don't get
no second chances, Mouse.

1847
01:45:42,015 --> 01:45:43,095
What are you talkin' about?

1848
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,998
Just promise me
you gonna do right, Mouse.

1849
01:45:55,014 --> 01:45:56,017
Promise.

1850
01:45:59,003 --> 01:45:59,992
I promise.

1851
01:46:00,016 --> 01:46:03,011
Then take this hoodie off,
and then go put that shirt on.

1852
01:46:04,008 --> 01:46:05,008
And wash your hands.

1853
01:46:07,017 --> 01:46:09,003
Diesel, shut up.

1854
01:46:14,009 --> 01:46:15,012
I'm fucked.

1855
01:46:53,001 --> 01:46:54,005
Blax.

1856
01:46:56,018 --> 01:46:58,002
Blax, what's next?

1857
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:06,997
I'm not strapped.
I'm here to turn myself in.

1858
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:08,981
Blax, what's goin' on?

1859
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:10,978
Turn yourself in for what?

1860
01:47:11,002 --> 01:47:12,983
For that robbery that killed
that little boy earlier.

1861
01:47:13,007 --> 01:47:13,999
No, no, no, Blax.

1862
01:47:14,023 --> 01:47:15,983
Shut the fuck up.

1863
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:18,001
- No, no, no. But you can't.
- Shut the fuck up.

1864
01:47:23,012 --> 01:47:24,991
He ain't got
shit to do with this.

1865
01:47:25,015 --> 01:47:26,998
He been here
fixin' his bike the whole time.

1866
01:47:27,022 --> 01:47:29,006
This is all me.

1867
01:47:30,014 --> 01:47:32,013
You know he a good kid,
right, Rivers?

1868
01:47:38,002 --> 01:47:40,000
The best thing you could do
is take me.

1869
01:47:41,012 --> 01:47:42,984
And keep me out
of his life forever.

1870
01:47:43,008 --> 01:47:44,009
Blax.

1871
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:53,989
Don't do this. Don't.

1872
01:47:54,013 --> 01:47:54,999
Blax.

1873
01:47:55,023 --> 01:47:56,988
- Primary suspect in custody.
- Blax. Listen to me.

1874
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:57,991
Listen to what I'm sayin',
Blax, please.

1875
01:47:58,015 --> 01:47:59,055
No sign of his accomplice.

1876
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:02,996
You have the right
to remain silent.

1877
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:06,984
Anything you say
can be held against you
in a court of law.

1878
01:48:07,008 --> 01:48:08,987
You have the right
to an attorney.

1879
01:48:09,011 --> 01:48:11,982
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

1880
01:48:12,006 --> 01:48:13,011
Blax.

1881
01:48:14,007 --> 01:48:15,018
No, no, don't do that.

1882
01:48:21,018 --> 01:48:23,000
