1
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,654
(Clock strikes )

2
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,291
I don't know why you bother
with that clock.

3
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,938
It never strikes the proper hour.

4
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,736
It keeps good time.

5
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:51,374
Right, what's on the docket
for this afternoon?

6
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,607
You're free.

7
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:56,452
The Langston case has been postponed.
They can't find the defendant.

8
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,610
Should I shift some appointments?
Fill up the day?

9
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:03,376
No. I'm going home early
this afternoon.

10
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,177
You haven't gone home early since...
Well...

11
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,294
You've never gone home early.

12
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:11,770
Family problems?

13
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,577
Yes, Doris. I've done in
the wife and child

14
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:16,967
and I've got to dispose
of the bodies.

15
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:18,776
Bye.

16
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:51,373
Hello.

17
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,053
My idea of paradise is one key
that opens everything.

18
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:57,015
Hello.

19
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:00,812
Doris phoned to say
you were on your way.

20
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,934
She's certain we're having problems

21
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:06,454
and no amount of reassurance
could persuade her otherwise.

22
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,928
So I had to tell her
I was with a satellite installer.

23
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:13,977
Well, as long as you get us
a good picture on Channel 5,

24
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,049
I can forgive anything.

25
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,527
Hello. Hello.

26
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:22,167
Have you been to the house
or are you on your way there?

27
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:25,216
No fooling you, is there?

28
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,651
(Gurgles )

29
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:35,534
I was on my way there.

30
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:38,496
But now I don't know
if I really want to see her.

31
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:44,968
You want to, Tom.

32
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:46,933
Hmm?

33
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,112
(Giving instructions )

34
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:16,833
(Woman ) Tom.

35
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:26,191
(Woman ) Tom.

36
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,660
Tom, hurry up. Your aunt
and uncle are waiting.

37
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,630
Come along now, Tom.

38
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,710
Mind Aunt Gwen and Uncle Alan,

39
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,748
do everything they say.

40
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,706
Why do I have to go?
Peter and I had plans.

41
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,750
We've explained all this, Tom.
Peter's ill.

42
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,426
You don't want to have measles, too,
do you?

43
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:56,470
- We'll take good care of him.
- Yes, glad to help.

44
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,703
It'll be good practice
for when we have our own.

45
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:11,671
The doctor said he wasn't
to get out of bed.

46
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:16,109
Tom, remember, you'll be a visitor.
Do try to be good.

47
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,750
We can climb the tower
one day, if you like.

48
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,060
How about now?

49
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,188
Not while you're in quarantine.

50
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,862
We'll climb it one day.

51
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:32,943
One day soon.

52
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:38,787
I trust we'll get on reasonably well.

53
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:40,464
Yes, Uncle Alan.

54
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:44,227
There's not much for you to do
at our flat, I'm afraid.

55
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:47,782
No children your age.
No garden to play in.

56
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,863
But we'll make the best of it.

57
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,228
(Alan ) We're here, Tom.

58
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,626
This house was something in its day.

59
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:18,146
It was split up into flats
some time ago.

60
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:30,790
Ours is on the first floor.

61
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,662
Don't touch that! It belongs
to the landlady upstairs.

62
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:40,223
- She's rather particular about it.
- Then why does she leave it there?

63
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:42,382
The clock's screwed to the wall.

64
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:46,991
My sister's eldest.

65
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:51,751
There won't be any running about,
will there?

66
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,145
My nerves can't cope
with running about.

67
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,348
He's a quiet boy, I assure you.

68
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:04,224
It's not worth
going out the back, Tom.

69
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,951
There's no garden.
Just the rubbish bins.

70
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,943
(Strikes )

71
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:12,502
Huh, seldom strikes
the correct hour, I'm afraid.

72
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,426
- What good is the old thing, then?
- Well, keeps good time.

73
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:30,706
The landlady lives there.
Mrs Bartholomew. She's very old.

74
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,987
She can't be fond of children.

75
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:37,145
We shan't be bothering her
during your stay here, shall we?

76
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:47,668
We're home.

77
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:54,948
This is the living room.

78
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:59,102
Come and see your bedroom, Tom.

79
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,991
This is a nursery!

80
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:14,585
I'm not a baby.

81
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:18,584
No. Of course you're not, Tom.

82
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:21,140
Well, the room...came like this.

83
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:24,383
The bathroom window has bars
on it as well.

84
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:29,020
We'll leave you to unpack. Settle in.

85
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:31,501
Then it'll be tea time.

86
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,031
(Knock)

87
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,945
Thought you might like to write home.

88
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:47,661
- Tell them you arrived safely.
- Thank you, Aunt Gwen.

89
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:58,784
(Tom ) 'I hope
your measles are better.

90
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:00,863
'This is a picture of Ely Cathedral.

91
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,625
'The house is flats
and there isn't a garden.

92
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:07,864
'My bedroom window has bars,
but Aunt Gwen says it's a mistake.

93
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,344
'Tom...

94
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:17,945
'Long.'

95
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,865
You may read in bed for ten minutes.
No longer.

96
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:25,619
Oh, and if you need
to use the convenience, remember...

97
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:28,582
it isn't shameful
for a young man to sit.

98
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:30,177
It's quieter that way.

99
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,619
I'll try to keep that in mind.

100
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:37,015
- Night, Tom. Sleep tight.
- Good night.

101
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:10,614
(Clock strikes )

102
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:22,303
Eight...nine...ten...

103
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:25,342
eleven...twelve.

104
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:28,655
For once it's correct. Thirteen.

105
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:31,133
Thirteen!

106
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,408
(Snoring)

107
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,415
(Door creaks )

108
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,888
Just rubbish bins.
They lied to me.

109
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,010
(Sneezes )

110
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:23,495
I'm very sorry.

111
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:03,092
I've lit a fire in the parlour.

112
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:44,485
(Softly) I'll come back.

113
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,740
- Do you believe lying is wrong?
- Of course, Tom.

114
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,338
- Always?
- Always.

115
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:07,939
- So, it's never justifiable?
- Never.

116
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:12,493
Suppose someone wasn't told
about something he'd enjoy,

117
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:15,223
because some people
didn't want to tell him?

118
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:18,216
Suppose they even said
the thing wasn't there,

119
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,818
so as not to let
the first person use it?

120
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:25,614
What was it the second people didn't
want the first people to know about?

121
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:29,253
Person, not people.
And let's say the thing was...

122
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:32,180
A hot water bottle?

123
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,061
No,

124
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:38,535
more like a couch, say, a large...

125
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:42,617
- outdoor couch.
- I'm not sure I've heard of that.

126
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,774
A large outdoor couch.

127
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:47,458
I don't think it matters
what the thing is.

128
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:49,216
If I understand Tom correctly,

129
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:51,898
some persons lied
for their own convenience

130
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,054
and to the harm of other persons.

131
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,499
That's it exactly, Uncle Alan.

132
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:59,815
I wondered if you thought
that kind of lying is right.

133
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:03,453
- I just wondered.
- Of all possible forms of lying,

134
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:06,820
that is surely the least justifiable.

135
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:10,453
Uncle Alan has a highly developed
sense of right and wrong.

136
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:13,934
I'm sure you will, too, one day.
When you're grown up.

137
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,099
Excuse me.

138
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:22,462
(Under breath) I have one now.
It's other people who haven't.

139
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:58,018
Hello.

140
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:01,141
I know you. You're the boy
from the first floor front.

141
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,021
The Kitsons'.

142
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,935
Bit dull for you round here?

143
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:10,462
Yes. Do you live
on the ground-floor back flat?

144
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:11,977
I do at that.

145
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,419
Do you have a maid?

146
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:16,574
Do I look the type to have a maid?

147
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:21,857
(Mutters ) No.

148
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:25,778
(Door bangs )

149
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:29,334
Old Ma Bartholomew's coming
to wind her precious clock.

150
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,221
You don't want to run into her.

151
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:35,183
There've never been children here.
She wouldn't like it.

152
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,975
Only twelve hours after all.

153
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:56,020
(Clock strikes )

154
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,895

159
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:50,819
(Footsteps )

160
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,573
(Birds twittering)

161
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,417
'Dear Peter, something
incredible has happened.

162
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,139
'You'll never believe it.'

of the devil, that he hurt me not.

00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:01,555
(Scream )

179
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,274
(Gasp )

180
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:15,639
(Birds twitter)

181
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:35,604
Er...not unless
you put the clock back.

182
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,732
So a tree could not be lying
fallen at one time,

183
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:41,932
and then standing up again
as it was before it fell?.

184
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,973
- Unless you put the clock back.
- Correct.

185
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,285
- What clock?
- No particular clock.

186
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,845
It's a saying - to have the past
again. No one can have that.

187
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,051
Time isn't like that.

188
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:02,728
You feeling all right?

189
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:05,807
- Yes, thank you.
- You were shivering,

190
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:07,692
as if you'd caught a chill.

191
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:10,885
I hope it's not the onset of measles.

192
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:13,011
You'd have to stay several weeks

193
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:15,006
instead of ten days.

194
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,888
Only ten days?

195
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:20,489
You must be dying to get home.

196
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:29,933
I think I do have a temperature.
And that it is measles.

197
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:41,013
No, you've no temperature.

198
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:42,972
No temperature, no measles.

199
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:47,048
(Alan ) That's a relief...for you,
I'm sure. Home soon.

200
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,853
(Crackles )

201
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,097
(Dog barks )

202
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,489
Let's all run from Hatty. Come on.

203
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,298
(Dog barks )

204
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,817
Please don't run from me.

205
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,094
(Scoffs )

206
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,489
Silly little juggins. Come on.

207
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,894
(Sniffs )

208
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,299
What will Aunt say?

209
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,534
Why did you fall?.

210
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,338
I'll think of something
to tell Mother.

211
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,208
Now I'm off with the others.
You'll stop crying, though?

212
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,616
Oh!

213
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,168
(Hatty ) Abel, have you seen
my cousins?

214
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,058
They been playing
hide and seek with you again?

215
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,370
It's the only game
they play with me.

216
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,419
Why don't you ask to do the hiding
and them the seeking for a change?

217
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,139
If they did, they wouldn't
find me easily.

218
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,293
I can hide better than they do.
I know more...secret places.

219
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,575
Do you, now, Miss Hatty?

220
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,017
I can be so quiet that nobody would
even know I'm in the garden at all.

221
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,458
Can you, now?

222
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,691
I can see everybody
and nobody can see me.

223
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,174
Hey!

224
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,179
Hey!

225
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,455
This way. Catch up.

226
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,490
(Soft wind)

227
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,013
Blooming heck.

228
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,052
(Cymbal clash)

229
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,855
(Dog barks )

230
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,898
(Gasps )

231
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:12,135
Shoo. Go away.

232
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,374
Shoo.

233
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:14,864
(Dog growls)

234
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:20,054
- Let's play another game.
- Yes. But Hatty sits it out.

235
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,854
- She doesn't play by the rules.
- Can I have an apple, please?

236
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:27,904
- Only if you play by the rules.
- You keep changing the rules.

237
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:30,738
That's because
you're too dense to keep up.

238
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:33,817
How dare you
stick your tongue out at us?

239
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:36,419
My tongue was hot.
I wanted to cool it off.

240
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:39,417
- Don't give pert, lying answers.
- Let her be.

241
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:43,498
Yes, we'll let her be, James.
We'll let her be all alone.

242
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:50,024
(Dog barks )

243
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:45,458
I've seen you watching me
and following me.

244
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:47,979
I saw you when Susan was dusting

245
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:50,784
and when you waved from the tree.

246
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:54,096
I saw you going right through
the orchard door.

247
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,301
I saw you when you never knew it.

248
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:00,538
- Who are you?
- I'm Tom.

249
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:04,698
Tom Long. I know your name.
It's Hatty.

250
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:08,983
Princess Hatty, if you please.
You may kiss my hand.

251
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,021
I don't want to kiss your hand!

252
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:17,859
If you're a princess, your father
and mother must be King and Queen.

253
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:20,456
- Where are they?
- I'm not allowed to say.

254
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,021
I'm held prisoner here.

255
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:25,412
Someone here calls herself my aunt,
though she isn't.

256
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:26,935
She's wicked and cruel.

257
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:29,820
Those boys you saw
aren't really my cousins,

258
00:33:29,902 --> 00:33:32,655
though I'm forced to call them that.

259
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:36,018
Now you know my secret,
I'll permit you to call me Princess,

260
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:38,058
and allow myself to play with you.

261
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:43,820
(Tom ) 'Peter, on a postcard,

262
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:46,655
'I can't describe
everything in the garden.

263
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:49,302
'I can tell you
what the garden looks like,

264
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:52,055
'but I can't explain
what it feels like.

265
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,692
'I mean to ask Hatty questions
about the garden and...

266
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:58,579
'everything, but somehow...'

267
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:00,653
- (Hatty ) Tom.
- '..I always forget.'

268
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:07,963
- Did you get it?
- Susan almost caught me, though.

269
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:13,520
I always wanted
to play bow-and-arrows,

270
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,642
but my cousins said I was too young.

271
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:19,036
Then when I was older,
they said they were too old.

272
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:24,919
(Glass smashes )

273
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:32,244
- You made this, Miss Hatty?
- All by myself.

274
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:35,682
- But who taught you to do it?
- Someone.

275
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:38,841
Well, whoever it was taught you,

276
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:41,963
take care he don't teach you
trouble with it.

277
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:44,719
Trouble, how could there
possibly be trouble?

278
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:45,761
(Scream )

279
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,974
(Laugh)

280
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,619
I left the gate open.

281
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:13,295
How she came here unbeknownst
is more than I know.

282
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,974
Unless the devil himself drew her.

283
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:19,209
I wager Hatty let the old thing in.

284
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:23,574
Harriet!

285
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:32,490
Why is there little doubt
you are to blame for this?

286
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:35,093
Must I remind you, Harriet,

287
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:38,933
that I received you into my home
as a duty to my late husband.

288
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:42,091
No, you don't need to remind me.

289
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,409
As a child of charity,

290
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,455
- you should be grateful.
- I am.

291
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,336
- Are you?
- Yes, Aunt.

292
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:50,171
- And obedient?
- Yes, Aunt.

293
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:51,931
Show me.

294
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,453
To your room, instantly.

295
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:10,415
Come on, girl.

296
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,578
Poor Hatty.

297
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:04,935
(Sobbing)

298
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,495
(Sobbing continues )

299
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:50,818
Don't cry.

300
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:54,097
What are you crying for?

301
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:58,377
For my real home,
my mother, for my father.

302
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,576
They're dead.
I don't want to be here.

303
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:06,853
Hatty!

304
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:09,976
Please leave me alone.
I just want to be alone.

305
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:16,416
(Tom ) 'Strange things happen
in the garden, Peter.

306
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:18,967
'I've seen Hatty
as a very little girl,

307
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:23,849
'very unhappy, crying,
and it makes me sad to see it.

308
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:27,534
'Sadder, I think,
than I've ever been.'

(Sighs )

310
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,096
I'm sorry our outing's ruined.

311
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,898
Can't we climb the tower?
I don't mind rain.

312
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:41,289
They close the tower
in weather like this.

313
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,768
I wish I didn't
have to go home tomorrow.

(Door closes )

318
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,909
If he has got a cold,
he can't go home.

319
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:11,032
Not with Peter just getting over
the measles.

320
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:12,594
No, you're right.

321
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:16,714
We'll telephone your sister and say
Tom must stay a little longer.

322
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:17,989
(Gwen ) Mmm.

323
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:24,068
Did Mr Bartholomew
always own this house?

324
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,033
Mr Bartholomew never even
lived in this house.

325
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:31,267
Mrs Bartholomew came here as a widow.
That wasn't many years ago.

326
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:35,792
But what about the clock in the hall?.
You said Mrs Bartholomew owned it.

327
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,435
But the clock has
always been in this house.

328
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:40,585
Now, why do you suppose that?

329
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:44,668
Come to think of it, that clock
must have been here for some time

330
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:48,270
because the screws at the back
have rusted into the wall.

331
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:52,871
Oh, I imagine Mrs Bartholomew must
have bought the clock with the house.

332
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:56,106
It's all straightforward
when you reason it out.

333
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:59,312
- Isn't it?
- I suppose so.

334
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:05,626
Gwen, I'm not saying yes
and I'm not saying no.

335
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:10,585
- But you do enjoy having him here?
- Most of the time.

336
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:16,106
But it would be different
if we had one of our own.

337
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,224
It would be permanent.
Not just a fortnight's visit.

338
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:25,626
It's such a wonderful feeling.

339
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:29,788
Knowing that there's another life
in the room next to us.

340
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,945
Sleeping peacefully.

341
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:41,865
What's it like, I wonder,
to be dead and a ghost?

342
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:43,149
You tell me.

343
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:45,590
I'm not a ghost.

344
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:49,270
Don't be silly. I saw you
walk through the orchard door.

345
00:41:49,355 --> 00:41:53,507
I'm not a ghost. The orchard door is.
The garden is. You are.

346
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:57,144
Indeed I'm not. You are,
and a silly little ghost you make

347
00:41:57,235 --> 00:42:00,147
- in those clothes.
- These are my best pyjamas.

348
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:03,386
- And this is my slipper.
- Why do you wear just one?

349
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:07,514
Is that the fashion nowadays?
Course not, because you are a ghost.

350
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:10,905
I could put my hand through
you as if you weren't there.

351
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,145
- I could!
- You're a ghost.

352
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:18,627
There you go. Your hand
didn't go through my arm,

353
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:20,671
my arm went through your hand.

354
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:23,553
And boys,
in their best pyjamas or not,

355
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:25,227
do not float in the air.

356
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:27,783
But I've proved it.
You're dead and gone

357
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,025
- and a ghost!
- I'm not dead.

358
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,949
I'm not dead.
Please, Tom, I'm not dead.

359
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:36,424
I'm sorry, I take it all back.

360
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:38,904
You're not a ghost, only don't cry.

361
00:42:38,995 --> 00:42:40,906
(Sniffs )

362
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:49,348
(Tom ) 'I'm glad you're better.
Try as I might,

363
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:52,984
'I can't seem to get
any real answers out of Hatty.

364
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:56,545
'The more time I spend with her,
the more confused I get.

365
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:59,388
'Peter, I'm learning
girls can be very...

366
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:02,069
'emotional and sometimes,
when they cry,

367
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:06,068
'you find you say any old rubbish
just to get them to stop.

368
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:11,190
'I need to find out more about Hatty.

369
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,468
'I need to find out
everything about her.

370
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,551
'But time is running out.'

371
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,153
(Thunder and heavy rain )

372
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:29,665
If you look through the yellow one,

373
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:31,985
everything's drenched in lemonade.

374
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:34,951
This one makes it look like night.

375
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:40,952
You can't really see
anything through the star.

376
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,265
Sometimes I like that best of all.

377
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:45,425
Look through and see nothing.

378
00:43:45,515 --> 00:43:47,949
You might think
there wasn't a garden.

379
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:49,912
But all the time, of course,

380
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:53,874
there is one, waiting for you.

381
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:02,705
This is my favourite tree. It's the
hardest to climb. I call it Tricksy.

382
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,655
See what I've carved here?

383
00:44:08,783 --> 00:44:11,661
This means Hatty Melbourne
climbed this tree.

384
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:13,256
Carve my name, too.

385
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:35,301
That means Tom Long
climbed this tree with you.

386
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,096
- It will always be here, won't it?
- Always.

387
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:41,378
Always and always.

388
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:48,821
I wonder what's on
the other side of that wall?.

389
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:51,337
I'm gonna climb
that wall and find out.

390
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:53,618
No, Tom. That wall's far too high.

391
00:45:02,823 --> 00:45:06,259
What do you see, Tom?
What do you see beyond the garden?

392
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:08,095
You can see the river

393
00:45:08,183 --> 00:45:12,256
and if you follow it with your eye,
you can see the Cathedral at Ely.

394
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,413
- And beyond that...
- Yes?

395
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,618
(Gasps )

396
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:45,977
Hatty!

397
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:51,419
Hatty, what happened?

398
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:55,098
Abel made me swear on the Bible
I would never climb the wall.

399
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:57,094
It's so high, he says, so dangerous.

400
00:45:57,183 --> 00:46:00,414
- Why would he think you would?
- He saw me looking up.

401
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:04,382
- Perhaps he heard me talk to you.
- No, your voice was too soft.

402
00:46:04,463 --> 00:46:06,693
He couldn't have heard me
or seen me.

403
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:09,980
- I don't know. He seemed so...
- Angry?

404
00:46:11,343 --> 00:46:12,901
Frightened.

405
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:20,495
I'm afraid you'll have to
stay indoors again, Tom.

406
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:25,738
We don't want you catching cold.

407
00:46:25,823 --> 00:46:27,700
I suppose not.

408
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:31,059
(Thunder)

409
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:35,138
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Tom.

410
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:37,940
All the time you've been here,

411
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:41,493
it looks as if you might
never climb the cathedral tower.

412
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:43,058
Mrs Kitson!

413
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,652
I thought we had an understanding.

414
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:49,940
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you mean, Mrs Willows.

415
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:52,457
No running about.
We agreed.

416
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,218
We weren't running about.
We were just climbing the stairs.

417
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:57,816
Rather quietly, I'd say.

418
00:46:57,903 --> 00:47:03,341
I don't mean now, I mean at night.
Every night there are footsteps.

419
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,981
Oh, and at what time

420
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:08,214
- do you hear these footsteps?
- Midnight.

421
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:10,294
Every night at midnight

422
00:47:10,383 --> 00:47:13,261
when the clock strikes, footsteps...

423
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:15,254
running down the stairs,

424
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:18,699
across the hall, out the back,
then right away,

425
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,421
back again!

426
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:24,416
Surely you're not suggesting Tom...
He's safely tucked in bed

427
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:26,095
at midnight, aren't you?

428
00:47:26,183 --> 00:47:30,540
Yes, Aunt Gwen. You see,
a boy my age needs ten hours sleep.

429
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:37,379
I know running about when I hear it.

430
00:47:40,463 --> 00:47:42,021
(Door closes )

431
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:43,855
(Sighs )

432
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:46,582
Well, the old dear is hearing things.

433
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,133
Must have her wig
strapped on too tight.

434
00:47:50,223 --> 00:47:51,736
(Laugh)

435
00:47:53,223 --> 00:47:54,781
(Clock strikes )

436
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:08,060
(Creak)

437
00:48:31,628 --> 00:48:33,346
I promised not to climb the wall.

438
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:36,181
I didn't say anything
about this tree.

439
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:38,782
If this is to be a proper house,

440
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:40,460
it must have windows,

441
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:42,857
not accidental gaps in the walls.

442
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:44,859
You expect too much.

443
00:48:44,948 --> 00:48:46,301
I hope I always shall.

444
00:48:46,388 --> 00:48:47,503
(Cracking)

445
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:48,907
(Hatty screams )

446
00:48:48,988 --> 00:48:50,660
Hatty!

447
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:18,460
Get you gone!

448
00:49:18,548 --> 00:49:21,506
Get you back to hell
where you come from.

449
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:22,816
I know you,

450
00:49:22,908 --> 00:49:26,947
I've seen you always and heard you
and thought best to seem deaf,

451
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:29,781
but I've known you for what you are -
the devil!

452
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:33,463
Please, Miss Hatty.
Is she alive or dead?

453
00:49:33,548 --> 00:49:35,903
You've tried to kill her
often enough.

454
00:49:35,988 --> 00:49:38,946
Her that had neither mother
nor father nor home here.

455
00:49:39,028 --> 00:49:42,384
Her innocence against your devilry.
May the Lord keep me

456
00:49:42,468 --> 00:49:45,346
from all the works of the devil,
that he hurt me not.

457
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:55,821
Let me in! Hatty! Hatty!

458
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:03,546
(Woman ) Abel, what's happened?
James, fetch the doctor!

459
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:05,663
(Door opens )

460
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,809
Abel, please. How is Hatty?

461
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,654
She's not...dead, is she?

462
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,493
No. She's alive.

463
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,057
(Clock ticking)

464
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,939
(Footsteps )

465
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,490
- Mother.
- Come in, James.

466
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,650
James.

467
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,259
How is Hatty?

468
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,377
Hatty will do well enough.

469
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,530
Is that what the doctor says?

470
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,417
Yes.

471
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,458
- We must be thankful, then.
- Thankful!

472
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,532
What was she doing
climbing trees at her age?

473
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,531
Hatty is young for her age.

474
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,975
Perhaps it's from being
alone so much.

475
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,972
It's beyond me to know
what would happen

476
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,575
to someone who so stubbornly
refuses to grow up.

477
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,858
Hatty will grow up, Mother.
She hasn't a choice. None of us do.

478
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,579
She'll grow up and she'll marry.

479
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,618
I'll not have her ruling this house
when I'm gone.

480
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,090
- Oh, Mother, please.
- You and Hubert and Edgar

481
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,934
are grown now and in your
father's business, independent.

482
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,213
But if any of you think
of marrying Harriet,

483
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,178
never ever expect a penny from me.

484
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,652
You know perfectly well
she loves only that garden.

485
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,128
We must change that,
include Hatty more

486
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,017
in parties with our friends.

487
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,854
You said yourself, she likes
only to be in that garden alone.

488
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,056
We could make her want more.

489
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,019
I'll tell her we all want her
to go out to make friends.

490
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,250
Can I say that you wish it, Mother?

491
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,570
Can I say at least that you agree?

492
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,653
You can say and do what you like,
but the less I see her, the better.

493
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,292
Why do you hate her so much?

494
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,136
I hate her...

495
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,690
because it's so easy
for the rest of you to love her.

496
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,898
(Hatty ) Come in.

497
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:18,888
Tom, come through slowly.
I want to see how it's done.

498
00:54:22,972 --> 00:54:24,291
It's a knack.

499
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:27,370
I wish I could do that.

500
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:31,445
How are you?

501
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:35,650
Oh, I'm quite well. The doctor
says the scar won't show.

502
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,087
- You had a visitor just now.
- Yes.

503
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:39,571
Cousin James.

504
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:43,486
He says I should do other things
besides falling out of trees.

505
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,325
Things without me?

506
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:49,165
Oh, no Tom. You can come
whenever you want to.

507
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,720
I count on it. I depend on it.

508
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,123
You have bars on your windows.

509
00:55:11,212 --> 00:55:13,248
It was a nursery once.

510
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,927
Don't be so sad, Tom.

511
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:27,640
Shall I show you something? A secret?

512
00:55:27,732 --> 00:55:29,529
I'd like that.

513
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:54,487
This was my mother
and father long ago.

514
00:55:54,572 --> 00:55:57,006
You used to say they were
King and Queen.

515
00:55:57,092 --> 00:56:00,050
James said I shouldn't
say things like that.

516
00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:03,329
And so I shan't.

517
00:56:03,412 --> 00:56:07,690
James says a great many things
that seem to take away the fun.

518
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,041
I have to go now.
I'll see you tomorrow.

519
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:18,770
You always say that. Then it's months
and months before I see you again.

520
00:56:18,852 --> 00:56:21,207
But I come every night.

521
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:36,324
Oh, Tom, I'm afraid
it's time for me to grow up.

522
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:40,925
I'll never get back.

523
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:44,049
Aunt Gwen, Uncle Alan!

524
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:55,524
(Bell rings )

525
00:58:10,412 --> 00:58:12,323
Sleep well, Miss Hatty.

526
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:42,008
- Who is it?
- It's only me.

527
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:43,684
Tom.

528
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:46,206
You came back.

529
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,884
I can't get home.

530
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:52,083
But you are home, Tom.

531
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:18,805
(Birds twittering)

532
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:04,485
'It was awful, Peter.
I was trapped in the past with Hatty.

533
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:08,485
'In the end I returned to now,
but I don't know how I did it.

534
01:00:08,572 --> 01:00:12,451
'It's almost as if Hatty
somehow helped me to get back.'

535
01:00:12,532 --> 01:00:14,523
'I think the clock holds the clue.

536
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,490
'So I need to get back
to the garden and to Hatty.

537
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,528
'That's really all I want.'

538
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:25,513
Well, Tom, we must be
saying goodbye to you soon.

539
01:00:25,595 --> 01:00:29,031
- When?
- On Saturday.

540
01:00:29,115 --> 01:00:31,675
I've just had a letter
from your mother.

541
01:00:31,755 --> 01:00:34,110
- This Saturday?
- Mmm.

542
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:35,787
We'll both miss you, Tom.

543
01:00:37,955 --> 01:00:40,947
We could hardly expect
to keep you any longer.

544
01:00:41,035 --> 01:00:42,707
Unless we adopted you.

545
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,312
If you adopt me?

546
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:49,066
I was only joking, Tom.

547
01:00:50,835 --> 01:00:54,510
It's gone rather chilly.
Shall I plug the fire in?

548
01:00:54,595 --> 01:00:56,631
Oh, yes.

549
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:04,384
- Hatty!
- Tom.

550
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:10,022
Tom, you're so much thinner.

551
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:14,548
I'm no such thing.
Aunt Gwen weighed me yesterday.

552
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:19,104
No, I didn't mean that.
I meant... thinner through.

553
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,629
No, I didn't mean that either.
Or rather...

554
01:02:22,713 --> 01:02:26,342
I thought we could look at the clock
to see what the book says

555
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:27,786
the angel's holding.

556
01:02:27,873 --> 01:02:31,422
Could we wait? Must you know now?
I'd much rather skate.

557
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:33,026
Oh, all right.

558
01:02:33,113 --> 01:02:35,627
I'm getting much better.
They all say so.

559
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:37,510
- Who's all?.
- James and Edgar

560
01:02:37,593 --> 01:02:40,426
and Hubert and...

561
01:02:40,513 --> 01:02:43,107
our new friend, Barty.

562
01:02:44,633 --> 01:02:46,351
Don't you like skating, Tom?

563
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:50,506
I do, yes, but I'd much rather
find out what the clock says.

564
01:02:50,593 --> 01:02:52,265
What the picture means.

565
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:55,671
All right.

566
01:03:05,793 --> 01:03:09,069
We must be very quiet.
Aunt is upstairs.

567
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:17,388
Time no longer.
But no longer than what?

568
01:03:17,473 --> 01:03:19,304
Tell me, Hatty.

569
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:22,112
Perhaps it means
when the last trump sounds

570
01:03:22,193 --> 01:03:24,548
and the end of the world comes.

571
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:33,632
Sometimes, Tom, it doesn't do
to ask so many questions.

572
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:40,504
Are you coming to the pond
with me to watch me skate?

573
01:03:40,593 --> 01:03:43,903
No, I must think.

574
01:03:59,193 --> 01:04:00,626
Imagine, Tom, that...

575
01:04:04,158 --> 01:04:06,035
this is a point in time.

576
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,908
Now, imagine a painter

577
01:04:09,998 --> 01:04:13,035
standing in a landscape
and painting it.

578
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,669
Imagine a second painter
coming up behind him

579
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:20,147
and painting
the same landscape with...

580
01:04:20,238 --> 01:04:21,956
the first painter's picture in it.

581
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:25,235
Imagine a third painter
painting the same landscape

582
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:27,195
with the first painter's picture,

583
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:31,317
and the second painter's picture
of the first painter's picture.

584
01:04:31,398 --> 01:04:33,434
Then a fourth painter.
A fifth!

585
01:04:33,518 --> 01:04:36,316
I hope this parallel
has made things clearer.

586
01:04:36,398 --> 01:04:37,751
Oh, yes.

587
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:39,476
Thank you, Uncle Alan.

588
01:04:39,558 --> 01:04:41,435
Let's look at it another way.

589
01:04:42,998 --> 01:04:44,750
Think of Rip van Winkel.

590
01:04:44,838 --> 01:04:47,591
No, actually
that's not very illuminating.

591
01:04:47,678 --> 01:04:50,351
Think of another point in time.

592
01:04:50,438 --> 01:04:54,431
That we'll call...point 'A'.

593
01:04:54,518 --> 01:04:57,669
Maybe different people
have different times

594
01:04:57,758 --> 01:05:00,716
although they're all bits
of the same big time.

595
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:03,392
- That would imply...
- So I might be able

596
01:05:03,478 --> 01:05:07,266
to step back into someone else's
time in the past

597
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:09,713
or she might step forward
into my time,

598
01:05:09,798 --> 01:05:14,076
which would seem the future to her,
but to me, the present.

599
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:18,477
It would be clearer
to go back to point 'A'.

600
01:05:18,558 --> 01:05:21,595
Whichever way, she'd be
no more a ghost in the past

601
01:05:21,678 --> 01:05:24,636
than I a ghost from the future -
we're not ghosts.

602
01:05:24,718 --> 01:05:26,913
And the garden isn't, either.

603
01:05:28,998 --> 01:05:31,796
That settles that.
You've been very helpful.

604
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:35,837
What settles what?
Gardens? Ghosts?

605
01:05:35,918 --> 01:05:37,874
We're talking of theories here.

606
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:42,031
But Uncle Alan, suppose someone had
stepped out of one time to another?

607
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:43,836
Like that. It would be proof.

608
01:05:43,918 --> 01:05:46,910
Apparently, I have
explained very little to you

609
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:48,556
if I haven't conveyed...

610
01:05:48,638 --> 01:05:50,708
Proof, in matters of time theory!

611
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:52,311
(Alan ) Proof!

612
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:12,032
- Barty.
- Just coming, James.

613
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:13,870
(Chatter)

614
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:16,915
James, may we go on Sunday?

615
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:22,231
Tom!

616
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:25,993
I'm so glad to see you. I miss you.

617
01:06:26,078 --> 01:06:29,275
Even now, in spite of the cousins
being so much nicer.

618
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:34,436
And Barty and skating!
Oh, Tom, skating!

619
01:06:34,518 --> 01:06:38,113
I feel as if I could go from here
to the end of the world.

620
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:41,793
I want to go far. So far.

621
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:45,632
- Tom, why haven't you skates?
- Where do you keep your skates?

622
01:06:45,718 --> 01:06:49,631
- When you're not using them.
- In the cupboard in the hall.

623
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:53,597
- Will you promise something?
- Not if it's wrong or dangerous.

624
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:57,193
- No tree-climbing.
- No, promise to keep your skates

625
01:06:57,278 --> 01:07:00,395
in the secret place you showed me,
in the wardrobe.

626
01:07:00,478 --> 01:07:03,117
- Under the floorboards.
- Why there?

627
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:06,349
Please promise.
I know it sounds silly,

628
01:07:06,438 --> 01:07:09,077
but that place is still secret,
isn't it?

629
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,388
The only person I ever told was you.

630
01:07:12,438 --> 01:07:14,906
I don't understand
why you want me to,

631
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:17,592
but I'll keep them there, I promise.

632
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:20,510
Tom!

633
01:07:21,118 --> 01:07:24,906
That promise means I'd have
to leave the skates behind

634
01:07:24,998 --> 01:07:26,716
if I ever went away from here.

635
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:01,605
(Creaks )

636
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:25,438
-To whomever may find this,

637
01:09:25,526 --> 01:09:28,802
-these skates are the property
of Harriet Melbourne,

638
01:09:28,886 --> 01:09:33,243
-but she leaves them in this place
in fulfilment of a promise she made.

639
01:09:33,326 --> 01:09:37,842
-Harriet Melbourne. June 2O, 18...-

640
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:15,843
Peter, you're looking
your old self again!

641
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:18,799
The doctor says you can
take a walk tomorrow.

642
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:21,241
Is there a card from Tom?

643
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:23,203
No, nothing today.

644
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:25,720
But you'll see him soon enough,

645
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,320
he's coming home
the day after tomorrow.

646
01:10:29,446 --> 01:10:33,564
Poor boy. He must have had
a dreadfully dull time.

647
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:37,639
(Clock striking)

648
01:10:59,206 --> 01:11:00,924
Tom!

649
01:11:04,606 --> 01:11:06,119
Hatty!

650
01:11:06,206 --> 01:11:08,845
I wasn't sure if it were you
or a trick of the light.

651
01:11:08,926 --> 01:11:13,044
- Of course it's me.
- I hope so. Look.

652
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:15,515
James is going to market this morning

653
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:17,915
and I'm going with him
to skate to Ely.

654
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:20,804
- Come.
- Without going through the garden?

655
01:11:20,886 --> 01:11:23,446
- I don't know if I can.
- Of course you can.

656
01:11:23,526 --> 01:11:26,598
The garden will always be there.
Waiting for you.

657
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,040
Ready, Harriet?

658
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:08,565
(Neighs )

659
01:12:20,126 --> 01:12:21,957
Never thought I'd see you again.

660
01:12:24,446 --> 01:12:26,277
What are we to do with that man?

661
01:12:27,566 --> 01:12:29,477
He keeps talking to himself.

662
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:10,883
(Market traders calling)

663
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:20,038
(Man ) Come on!

664
01:13:23,046 --> 01:13:24,764
(Man ) Merry Christmas!

665
01:13:27,566 --> 01:13:29,363
I'll be no longer than an hour.

666
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:32,961
If we miss each other,
you'll need to take the train.

667
01:14:18,302 --> 01:14:20,691
- Shall we climb the tower, Tom?
- Yes!

668
01:14:45,852 --> 01:14:47,683
(Visitors exclaim )

669
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,284
286 steps.

670
01:14:52,372 --> 01:14:56,126
Five minutes!
Five minutes until last descent.

671
01:15:06,812 --> 01:15:10,248
(Tom ) -Mr James Robinson,
gentleman of the city...

672
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:13,404
-who exchanged time for eternity.-

673
01:15:36,252 --> 01:15:37,890
Tom, where's the garden?

674
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:40,088
I want to see the garden

675
01:15:40,172 --> 01:15:43,448
- where you and Hatty play.
- The garden's over there.

676
01:15:43,532 --> 01:15:46,444
Hatty's here. She's the one
carrying skates.

677
01:15:46,532 --> 01:15:49,842
That's not Hatty,
that's a grown-up woman.

678
01:15:49,932 --> 01:15:51,365
(Tower keeper) Time!

679
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,841
Time to go down,
ladies and gentleman.

680
01:15:53,932 --> 01:15:55,490
But she's grown-up.

681
01:15:55,572 --> 01:15:58,040
How can you play
with someone grown-up?

682
01:16:05,372 --> 01:16:09,160
Who was he, Tom? What was he?

683
01:16:09,252 --> 01:16:12,324
Come on, lady. Time, time.

684
01:16:14,732 --> 01:16:19,169
He's my brother, Hatty.
He's real. Like me.

685
01:16:44,452 --> 01:16:45,771
Miss Hatty.

686
01:16:47,412 --> 01:16:49,243
Barty.

687
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:51,963
I'm so glad to see you.

688
01:16:52,052 --> 01:16:53,963
Where are you off to all alone?

689
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:55,849
She's not alone, actually...

690
01:16:55,932 --> 01:16:58,685
James brought me to town.
I'm taking the train home.

691
01:16:58,772 --> 01:17:01,332
I have my carriage.
Might I give you a lift?

692
01:17:03,892 --> 01:17:05,689
Hatty, wouldn't you rather...

693
01:17:18,252 --> 01:17:23,042
- I see you like skating.
- Yes. More than anything.

694
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:27,284
We could go next week, if you like.
To Castleford or Littleport.

695
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:29,010
If you'd like.

696
01:17:29,092 --> 01:17:31,287
We'd love to.

697
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:51,132
Whoa. Here we are.

698
01:18:18,812 --> 01:18:20,768
Good night, Miss Hatty.

699
01:18:22,092 --> 01:18:23,684
Good night, Barty.

700
01:18:26,332 --> 01:18:28,209
Yes. Good night, Barty!

701
01:18:58,132 --> 01:19:01,647
Hatty, wouldn't you like
to go into the garden?

702
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:03,484
(Sniffs )

703
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,766
Hatty.

704
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:07,366
Don't you see me, don't you hear me?

705
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:12,126
Please don't walk through me.

706
01:19:13,132 --> 01:19:16,169
Hatty, please don't walk through me.

707
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:17,624
- Perhaps we should wake him.
- Yes.

708
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:21,500
A boy his age needs
ten hours sleep, not twelve.

709
01:20:47,392 --> 01:20:48,825
No, not this time.

710
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:51,028
- What is it, Tom?
- Not now.

711
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:53,546
You're awake. It's morning.

712
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:57,509
Oh, you've been in a nightmare.

713
01:20:59,352 --> 01:21:03,868
It's over now. It's over now.

714
01:21:03,952 --> 01:21:05,510
(Gwen ) Alan.

715
01:21:07,512 --> 01:21:10,948
I think it's time
for Tom's sake that he went home.

716
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:14,820
He's terribly strung up.
Bad dreams, nightmares.

717
01:21:17,912 --> 01:21:21,905
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
even walking in his sleep.

718
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:36,865
'I have to get Hatty back,
Peter, the way she was.

719
01:21:36,952 --> 01:21:40,627
'I have a feeling that if I make
one last trip into the garden,

720
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:44,864
'Hatty might be a little girl again
and we could play together.

721
01:21:44,952 --> 01:21:48,627
'I want that so much.
I want time to go back.

722
01:21:48,712 --> 01:21:52,990
'I'm telling you this because I might
not be home tomorrow as planned.

723
01:21:53,072 --> 01:21:57,543
'Tonight I will exchange
time for eternity.'

724
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,989
I'm coming, Hatty.
I'll find you in the dark.

725
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:13,826
(Clatter)

726
01:22:31,152 --> 01:22:33,620
Hatty! Hatty!

727
01:22:33,712 --> 01:22:35,509
(Door opens )

728
01:22:35,592 --> 01:22:36,866
(Dogs bark)

729
01:22:44,112 --> 01:22:46,546
Uncle Alan.

730
01:22:46,632 --> 01:22:48,668
Come on, let's get you into bed.

731
01:22:55,032 --> 01:23:00,868
Midnight. Every night at midnight
footsteps running down the stairs...

732
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,270
He seems to be in shock.

733
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:07,912
(Sighs )

734
01:23:07,992 --> 01:23:10,426
It must have been
the terror of waking up

735
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:14,300
and finding himself standing outside
in the dark all alone.

736
01:23:14,392 --> 01:23:16,189
And he was carrying these.

737
01:23:16,272 --> 01:23:19,867
Strange things to carry around,
even when sleep-walking.

738
01:23:19,952 --> 01:23:23,740
- Where did he come by them?
- That's what I'd like to know.

739
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:28,064
- And he was calling out to someone.
- Probably his mother.

740
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:32,065
No, it was someone else.

741
01:23:42,968 --> 01:23:46,278
(Alan ) It was that old woman.
(Gwen ) Mrs Bartholomew?

742
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:49,883
Why can't she leave
well enough alone?

743
01:23:49,968 --> 01:23:51,959
- What did she want?
- An apology

744
01:23:52,048 --> 01:23:53,925
for last night's disturbance.

745
01:23:54,008 --> 01:23:56,124
Of course, I apologised profusely.

746
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:58,563
But she says the boy
must go up himself.

747
01:23:58,648 --> 01:24:01,037
That's outrageous.

748
01:24:01,128 --> 01:24:04,165
I wouldn't dream
of sending him up there.

749
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:07,797
No, I'll go. I ought to.

750
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:10,481
I don't mind.

751
01:24:10,568 --> 01:24:12,399
I don't mind anything now.

752
01:24:31,968 --> 01:24:33,686
(Woman ) Come in.

753
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,764
Your name is Tom, isn't it?

754
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:04,840
Yes. My name is Tom.

755
01:25:04,928 --> 01:25:07,283
- And I've come to apolo...
- Tom Long.

756
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:08,687
I'm sorry about...

757
01:25:08,768 --> 01:25:12,044
You woke me in the middle
of the night.

758
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:14,084
I've said I'm sorry.

759
01:25:15,888 --> 01:25:17,844
You called out a name.

760
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,322
Tom,

761
01:25:23,408 --> 01:25:26,127
you called me.

762
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,607
Don't you see?

763
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:31,566
You called me.

764
01:25:35,368 --> 01:25:37,165
I'm Hatty.

765
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:45,600
That's the barometer.

766
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:48,407
The barometer
from the Melbournes' hall!

767
01:25:48,488 --> 01:25:50,399
Uh-huh.

768
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:54,203
And the owl!

769
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:58,606
I don't understand.

770
01:25:58,688 --> 01:26:01,077
The garden is gone and yet...

771
01:26:01,168 --> 01:26:02,726
all these things are here.

772
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:09,444
You say you were Hatty.
Our Hatty!

773
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:14,556
- Yes. I was Hatty. I am Hatty.
- What happened after the day

774
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:16,923
we skated to Ely
and climbed the tower?

775
01:26:17,008 --> 01:26:18,805
The last time we saw each other.

776
01:26:18,888 --> 01:26:23,279
But that wasn't the last time
we saw each other, Tom.

777
01:26:23,368 --> 01:26:25,040
Have you forgotten?

778
01:26:26,008 --> 01:26:27,760
Don't you remember?

779
01:26:39,165 --> 01:26:41,121
That's young Barty.

780
01:26:43,005 --> 01:26:45,565
His name was John Bartholomew.

781
01:26:45,645 --> 01:26:48,034
That was taken soon after we married.

782
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:55,118
It was in the year 1895
that we skated to Ely

783
01:26:55,205 --> 01:26:57,196
and climbed the tower.

784
01:26:57,285 --> 01:27:00,800
We met Barty and he gave us a lift.

785
01:27:00,885 --> 01:27:03,683
He told me later
he'd made up his mind that day

786
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:05,756
he wanted me for his wife.

787
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:08,040
We married a year later.

788
01:27:08,125 --> 01:27:12,915
Aunt Melbourne was more than happy
to have me off her hands.

789
01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:15,838
Midsummer eve
was the eve of my wedding.

790
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:19,554
I was finishing the last
of my packing that night.

791
01:27:19,645 --> 01:27:23,320
I took what I thought
was a last look around the house.

792
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:29,155
Suddenly, and I don't know why,
I remembered my skates

793
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,361
and that made me remember you.

794
01:27:31,445 --> 01:27:33,913
It had been so long
since I'd seen you

795
01:27:34,005 --> 01:27:39,238
and I knew I had to leave them there,
in the wardrobe, where we'd agreed.

796
01:27:39,325 --> 01:27:44,718
- I wrote a note to go with them.
- I found the note. Signed and dated.

797
01:27:44,805 --> 01:27:47,558
In one of the last years
of the old century.

798
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:51,840
That night was very hot

799
01:27:51,925 --> 01:27:54,564
and I was so excited,
I couldn't sleep.

800
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:57,000
I thought of my wedding the next day

801
01:27:57,085 --> 01:28:03,877
and for the first time, I thought of
all I'd be leaving behind me.

802
01:28:03,965 --> 01:28:06,035
My childhood.

803
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:08,434
All the time I'd spent in the garden.

804
01:28:08,525 --> 01:28:11,597
All the time I'd spent with you, Tom.

805
01:28:11,685 --> 01:28:13,323
You remembered me?

806
01:28:15,845 --> 01:28:19,963
That night there was a thunderstorm

807
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:24,084
with the most brilliant lightning
I was ever to see.

808
01:28:25,645 --> 01:28:28,159
'Aunt Melbourne was away in London.

809
01:28:28,245 --> 01:28:32,841
'I stood at her sitting room window
and looked out over the garden.

810
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,959
'The lightning flashes
made everything very clear.

811
01:28:38,045 --> 01:28:39,922
'I could see every tree,

812
01:28:40,005 --> 01:28:42,599
'every bush, every memory.

813
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:47,076
'And when I looked down,
I could see you.

814
01:28:47,165 --> 01:28:49,998
'You were standing
at the back of the house

815
01:28:50,085 --> 01:28:54,442
'and you looked as thin through
as a piece of moonshine.

816
01:28:55,605 --> 01:29:01,521
'You went indoors
and that was the last I saw of you.

817
01:29:01,605 --> 01:29:06,759
'I said to myself,
he's gone, but the garden is here.

818
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:10,114
'The garden will always be here.

819
01:29:10,205 --> 01:29:12,435
'It will never change.

820
01:29:13,605 --> 01:29:16,802
'At the far end of the garden,
there was a ruin.'

821
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:19,843
(Tom ) 'With an old tree
growing out of it.'

822
01:29:19,925 --> 01:29:23,361
That midsummer eve,
when the storm was at its worst,

823
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:28,565
a great wind caught the tree
and the lightning struck it.

824
01:29:28,645 --> 01:29:30,636
It fell.

825
01:29:30,725 --> 01:29:32,204
(Screams )

826
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:34,003
You cried out.

827
01:29:34,085 --> 01:29:35,484
(Gasps )

828
01:29:39,805 --> 01:29:42,114
It was then I realised, Tom,

829
01:29:42,205 --> 01:29:46,881
that of course the garden
was changing, all the time.

830
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,525
Nothing stands still.

831
01:29:49,605 --> 01:29:51,880
Except in our memory.

832
01:29:53,525 --> 01:29:58,997
When the house was being sold, Barty
and I came over for the auction.

833
01:30:03,725 --> 01:30:08,799
'The past I had escaped from,
but which was so much part of me,

834
01:30:08,885 --> 01:30:11,479
'was up for sale.

835
01:30:11,565 --> 01:30:16,355
'I stood with Barty
in front of the mantle

836
01:30:16,445 --> 01:30:19,403
'in what was once the parlour.'

837
01:30:19,485 --> 01:30:20,884
Excuse me, sir.

838
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:24,594
(Hatty ) 'In that place where
I had stood on Christmas Eve

839
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,483
'the night I realised
that Barty loved me

840
01:30:27,565 --> 01:30:29,362
'and that I loved him.

841
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:34,717
'The house was already
quite different by then.

842
01:30:36,445 --> 01:30:40,757
'Colder, sadder, emptier.

843
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:45,965
'But the clock, our clock,
was still there.

844
01:30:47,005 --> 01:30:49,519
'Still ticking! Still alive.

845
01:30:51,605 --> 01:30:56,395
'Something that day, some feeling,
some vestige of memory,

846
01:30:56,485 --> 01:31:00,398
'drew me back to what
was left of the garden.

847
01:31:00,485 --> 01:31:03,716
'Somehow I knew that Tricksy
would survive.

848
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:07,718
'Barty sensed that tree, that place
held a special memory for me.

849
01:31:07,805 --> 01:31:11,036
'Even though I could never
really explain why to him.

850
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:14,435
'To know that it was
important to me was enough for him.

851
01:31:14,525 --> 01:31:19,155
'Very much in love,
Barty and I stood together

852
01:31:19,245 --> 01:31:24,365
'beneath Tricksy's branches as the
world around us continued to change.

853
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:28,643
'By the end of that day, there would
be just one tree still standing

854
01:31:28,725 --> 01:31:32,513
'in what was once our garden -
Tricksy.'

855
01:31:32,605 --> 01:31:37,315
It's in its very own,
very much smaller garden now.

856
01:31:38,925 --> 01:31:42,076
I hope whoever owns it
takes good care of it.

857
01:31:43,725 --> 01:31:46,080
Did Barty buy the clock for you?

858
01:31:46,165 --> 01:31:50,158
Yes. Barty bought the house
and the clock.

859
01:31:50,245 --> 01:31:53,476
I'd always loved it.
Loved to hear it striking.

860
01:31:53,565 --> 01:31:56,159
But you didn't come to live here?
Not then.

861
01:31:56,245 --> 01:31:59,999
No. We had a home in the Fens

862
01:32:00,085 --> 01:32:03,680
and we were content there,
more than.

863
01:32:05,085 --> 01:32:07,076
We had two children.

864
01:32:08,485 --> 01:32:09,838
Two boys.

865
01:32:16,605 --> 01:32:19,165
They were both killed
in the Great War.

866
01:32:20,205 --> 01:32:22,719
The First World War, we call it now.

867
01:32:25,925 --> 01:32:29,759
And then many years later,
Barty died.

868
01:32:30,765 --> 01:32:33,598
Peacefully. In my arms.

869
01:32:35,445 --> 01:32:37,481
I was left quite alone.

870
01:32:38,685 --> 01:32:40,835
And that was when I came here.

871
01:32:41,885 --> 01:32:44,524
And I've lived here ever since.

872
01:32:45,725 --> 01:32:49,923
Since you've come here, you've
often gone back in time, haven't you?

873
01:32:50,005 --> 01:32:53,236
- Back into the past?
- Oh yes, Tom!

874
01:32:53,325 --> 01:32:56,874
When you're my age,
you live in the past.

875
01:32:58,085 --> 01:32:59,996
You remember it.

876
01:33:01,525 --> 01:33:02,844
You dream it.

877
01:33:08,205 --> 01:33:12,244
These last few nights you've hardly
dreamt about the garden at all.

878
01:33:12,325 --> 01:33:15,556
You've been dreaming
of winter and skating

879
01:33:15,645 --> 01:33:17,124
and Barty.

880
01:33:17,205 --> 01:33:21,642
Yes. Of growing up.

881
01:33:22,685 --> 01:33:24,960
Of love.

882
01:33:25,045 --> 01:33:26,717
Of Barty.

883
01:33:26,805 --> 01:33:31,276
I suppose you couldn't really
help that, if you were growing up.

884
01:33:31,365 --> 01:33:34,198
You were getting thinner
every time I saw you.

885
01:33:34,285 --> 01:33:37,243
The last time we were together,
you seemed to vanish.

886
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:39,600
So last night...

887
01:33:39,685 --> 01:33:44,805
I dreamt of my wedding
and of leaving here.

888
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:49,481
Last night I called to you, but I
never thought you would hear me.

889
01:33:49,565 --> 01:33:52,284
Oh, you woke me.

890
01:33:52,365 --> 01:33:54,959
But I didn't mind.

891
01:33:55,045 --> 01:33:58,401
I knew it was Tom calling for help.

892
01:33:58,485 --> 01:34:03,036
- I couldn't believe you were real.
- We're both real. Then and now.

893
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:05,639
It's as the pendulum says...

894
01:34:05,725 --> 01:34:07,920
(Both) Time no longer.

895
01:34:08,005 --> 01:34:11,077
Do you think our marks
still show on Tricksy?

896
01:34:11,165 --> 01:34:13,599
I dream they do.

897
01:34:23,605 --> 01:34:25,323
How is that brother of yours?

898
01:34:25,405 --> 01:34:27,282
- What was his name?
- Peter.

899
01:34:27,365 --> 01:34:31,324
Peter. Will you bring him
to visit me next time you come?

900
01:34:31,405 --> 01:34:33,441
I promise. And you and I...

901
01:34:33,525 --> 01:34:36,358
- we keep our promises.
- We do.

902
01:34:42,805 --> 01:34:44,921
Until the next time.

903
01:34:45,005 --> 01:34:48,395
- Goodbye, Tom.
- Goodbye, Ha...

904
01:34:50,285 --> 01:34:52,515
Goodbye, Mrs Bartholomew.

905
01:35:11,845 --> 01:35:13,278
Goodbye, Hatty.

906
01:35:24,965 --> 01:35:27,718
When he ran to her
and they hugged each other,

907
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:30,558
it was as if they'd known
each other for years

908
01:35:30,645 --> 01:35:34,274
instead of only having met
for the first time this morning.

909
01:35:35,085 --> 01:35:37,235
And there was something else, Alan.

910
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:39,520
I know this sounds even more absurd,

911
01:35:39,605 --> 01:35:44,360
Mrs Bartholomew's an old woman
and hardly bigger than Tom, but...

912
01:35:44,445 --> 01:35:46,356
when he put his arms around her

913
01:35:46,445 --> 01:35:49,960
and they hugged each other goodbye,
it was as if...

914
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:51,683
as if she were a little girl.

915
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:55,361
- Stop! Stop the car.
- Tom!

916
01:35:57,405 --> 01:35:59,123
(Tyres screech)

917
01:36:01,565 --> 01:36:04,079
(Alan ) Tom, what are you doing?

918
01:36:04,165 --> 01:36:06,395
I'm sorry, sir, do you have a garden?

919
01:36:06,485 --> 01:36:09,045
A small one, yes.
Would you care to see it?

920
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:12,276
Tom, what are you doing?
So sorry. But...

921
01:36:12,365 --> 01:36:14,833
I'm sorry. Good morning.
Would you mind?

922
01:36:18,085 --> 01:36:19,643
Tom where are you?

923
01:36:23,685 --> 01:36:26,358
Where have you gone? Tom!

924
01:36:28,845 --> 01:36:31,120
We...we're very sorry. The boy...

925
01:36:31,205 --> 01:36:34,277
- He's been...
- He's been very ill with a bad cold.

926
01:37:13,885 --> 01:37:16,683
Gwen, I think it would be...

927
01:37:16,765 --> 01:37:19,757
I know what you're going to say.

928
01:37:19,845 --> 01:37:22,234
I think it would be nice
to have a child.

929
01:37:22,325 --> 01:37:25,078
What? After everything
that just happened?

930
01:37:25,165 --> 01:37:26,644
With...

931
01:37:26,725 --> 01:37:28,716
(Whispers ) With Tom?

932
01:37:28,805 --> 01:37:30,682
- I...
- It would be wonderful.

933
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:32,960
Another life
asleep in the next room.

934
01:37:34,245 --> 01:37:35,564
Won't it?

935
01:37:35,645 --> 01:37:37,363
Won't it just?

936
01:37:37,445 --> 01:37:40,357
Of course, discipline
will be paramount.

937
01:37:40,445 --> 01:37:42,959
(Sighs )

938
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:05,316
(Crash)

939
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:06,995
(Shattering)

940
01:38:15,843 --> 01:38:17,435
She's asleep.

941
01:38:23,883 --> 01:38:26,033
How was it?

942
01:38:26,123 --> 01:38:28,353
Sad to see the old place go, but...

943
01:38:28,443 --> 01:38:31,515
it really hadn't been
the same since she died.

944
01:38:32,883 --> 01:38:35,477
Well, you were very good to her, Tom.

945
01:38:36,523 --> 01:38:39,083
She loved seeing you grow up.

946
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,841
Seeing you married.

947
01:38:43,603 --> 01:38:46,117
I wish she could have seen
young Harriet.

948
01:38:46,203 --> 01:38:49,513
Hmm. But she saw us here.

949
01:38:50,763 --> 01:38:55,154
I've never seen her so happy as the
day we brought her to this house.

950
01:39:10,043 --> 01:39:14,002
She stood here and touched it...

951
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:16,916
and said, -It's all real.-

952
01:39:17,363 --> 01:39:19,558
-You've made it all real, Tom.-

953
01:39:21,763 --> 01:39:23,719
-And you've kept it alive.-

954
01:39:27,683 --> 01:39:29,878
And so you have, my love.
