1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,934
Yeah, that right, Chris.
FEMA officials are now saying

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:06,633
that if you can get out
of the tri-state area

3
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:08,684
before this storm gets here,
you really should.

4
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:11,103
The National Weather Service
equating the severity

5
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:14,223
of this nor'easter
with a category three hurricane.

6
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:15,942
Now we're already picking up.
(screaming) Help!

7
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:19,028
Sustained winds right here around...
Help!

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,698
Please, someone!

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,450
Help!

10
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:27,370
What happened?

11
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:28,537
He mugged me.

12
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,489
Here, come on.

13
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:33,409
(newscast continues
indistinctly)

14
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,578
Let me see what happened.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,463
(French accent):
I don't want to hurt you.

16
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:38,748
Just do as I say.

17
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,082
Open the door.

18
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:42,891
Don't!

19
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:44,858
(gunshot)

20
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,924
(newscast continues
indistinctly)

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,852
(tone chimes)

22
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:03,354
Let's go.

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,225
(beep, tone chimes)

24
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,871
(gunshot)

25
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,956
Hey, I'm back.

26
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,276
There was a run
on the storm stuff,

27
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:28,946
but I got, uh, bottled water,
batteries, soup.

28
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,799
Oh, hi.

29
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,052
Um, I'm Joan Watson.

30
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:36,521
Ms. Hudson.

31
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,339
Pleased to meet you.

32
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,558
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
we had a meeting.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,377
Oh, no, I-I'm not a client.

34
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,779
(sniffles)
I'm-I'm a mess.

35
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,965
Oh, do you want to talk
about it?

36
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,168
You know...

37
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,137
Love.

38
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,607
You know what, let me...
let me put this stuff away.

39
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,275
Uh, can I get you
some coffee?

40
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:59,577
Uh, no.

41
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,313
Maybe some tea.

42
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:05,583
White Darjeeling.

43
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,004
Ms. Hudson
is a fascinating woman.

44
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,006
She has
an Oxford don's knowledge

45
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,375
of ancient Greek,
but she's a complete autodidact.

46
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:16,427
She consulted with me

47
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:19,163
for several cases I worked
with Scotland Yard.

48
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,966
Of course, you had more than one
case involving ancient Greek.

49
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:23,851
Well, it's actually
a very fitting field of study

50
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,187
for Ms. Hudson, considering
she makes her living

51
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,106
as something of a muse.

52
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,775
Well, "muse" is not a job title.

53
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:34,195
Yet our Ms. Hudson
consistently finds herself

54
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,013
in the company of
powerful men in crisis.

55
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:38,149
A novelist

56
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:39,784
who can't quite finish
his masterpiece here,

57
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:43,371
a designer abandoned
by fickle inspiration there.

58
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,707
Well, at some point these men
must realize that Ms. Hudson...

59
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,208
Has a Adam's apple, yes.

60
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,876
Of course.

61
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,828
It's all rather complicated,
I imagine,

62
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,380
but life is infinitely stranger

63
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,365
than anything the mind of man
could invent.

64
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,866
Cod liver oil?

65
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:56,884
No.

66
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,403
And what is

67
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:01,205
the fascinating Ms. Hudson
doing in the library?

68
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,892
She's recovering from her latest
romantic contretemps.

69
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,228
For the last year or so,
Ms. Hudson has been

70
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,715
the kept woman of a Davis Renkin
of 3T Enterprises.

71
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:12,317
I gather Mrs. Renkin

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,769
recently found out
about the arrangement.

73
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,688
The salient detail
is she's been evicted

74
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,439
from Mr. Renkin's pied-à-terre.

75
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,491
Nevertheless, there's
a blizzard on the way.

76
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,160
She needed a place to stay.

77
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:23,661
Oh, so we have a houseguest now.

78
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,697
Yes, would you have advised
I throw her out on the street?

79
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,565
Of course not, but you know,
you have a lot of work

80
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,066
to do
on this whole roommate thing.

81
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:30,868
I mean, the polite thing would
have been to ask

82
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,286
before inviting her
into the house.

83
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,421
(phone vibrating)
You know,

84
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,739
just like it's polite

85
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,424
to clean up after yourself
in the kitchen.

86
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,743
I clean the refrigerator once
a month; that was our bargain.

87
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,412
Yeah, and once a month,
it is sparkling clean,

88
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,914
and the rest of the time,
it is a science experiment.

89
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,466
This is all rather diverting,

90
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:46,917
but I'm afraid
it's gonna have to wait.

91
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,436
Captain Gregson needs
our assistance

92
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,472
investigating a homicide.

93
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,274
(sirens chirping)

94
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:56,427
GREGSON:
You guys got here fast.

95
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,062
L Train still running?

96
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:01,632
Yeah, orderly shutdown commences
at midday.

97
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,268
This is, uh,

98
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,870
Frank Dempster.

99
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,072
The cleaning crew found
him at 5:00 this morning.

100
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,957
He'd been dead
for about three hours.

101
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,342
Thief was long gone,

102
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:13,211
and nobody saw nothing.

103
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:15,446
Yeah, security footage is gone?

104
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,448
Yeah.

105
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,951
Well, no sign of forced entry,

106
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:24,806
so Mr. Dempster let
the murderer in.

107
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:27,124
He was shot right there,

108
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,093
dragged behind
this station,

109
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:32,313
at which point...

110
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,016
(indistinct radio transmission)

111
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,971
He wasn't dead yet,

112
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,523
the guard.

113
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:46,828
He got off one shot
before he took a second wound.

114
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,196
Agreed.

115
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,615
The height of the bullet lodged
in the wall here

116
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:52,083
and this blood splatter suggests

117
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,702
that Mr. Dempster's final act

118
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:58,589
was blasting a hole
through someone's abdomen.

119
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,007
A through and through
like that

120
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,826
would require
medical attention.

121
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,011
Yeah, we put the word
out to all the hospitals

122
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,963
in the city;
Red Cross storm shelters

123
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,765
are gonna keep
an eye out, too.

124
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,183
You said the killer was a thief.

125
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,551
What was stolen?

126
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,303
BELL:
The hot new toy.

127
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:14,138
It's supposed to come out
at midnight tomorrow.

128
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,891
I don't know who lines up
at midnight for a phone,

129
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:18,342
but somebody didn't
want to wait.

130
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,677
They took the floor models

131
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,529
then got about 200
from the supply room.

132
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,980
You're looking
for a group of thieves,

133
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:24,899
one may be a woman,
and I suspect that "she"

134
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:26,534
did the shooting.

135
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,786
This hair is synthetic.

136
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,521
It comes from a cheap blond wig.

137
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:32,857
Probably got stuck
to the packing tape

138
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,826
when they opened up a box
of Verzia 8s

139
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,627
to verify its contents.

140
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,995
Now, given the wig,

141
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,881
I suspect that murdering
a security guard,

142
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41,716
not part of the plan.

143
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:44,135
You think she had help.

144
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,804
Well, hard to imagine her toting
all those phones

145
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,723
after being shot
in the gut.

146
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:50,258
So I'd say two accomplices,

147
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,176
plus given the nature of parking
in this neighborhood,

148
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,595
a driver to help
with the getaway.

149
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:56,380
Just to be certain,

150
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:58,900
uh, you want my assistance
in solving this?

151
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:00,735
Yeah, that a problem?

152
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,236
No, it's just...

153
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,522
Due respect to Mr. Dempster,

154
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:06,073
this is a garden-variety
robbery-homicide.

155
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,058
You find the phones,
you catch the killers.

156
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,695
So it's a bit...

157
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,064
OFFICER:
What happened to the lights?

158
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,232
Hey, what's
going on?

159
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,734
Hey, Captain, sounds like

160
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,536
(car horns honking)
the whole city is dark.

161
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,571
We're trying to figure
out what's going on.

162
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,540
Well, if I have to solve this
in the Stone Age,

163
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,342
I suppose it might be
interesting after all.

180
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,913
The winds knocked out
a power plant down there,

181
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,182
and tripped
the whole northeastern grid.

182
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,883
So the power is not
coming back, folks.

183
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,686
Coordinated deployment just got
that much more important.

184
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,920
I don't think
that's what they had in mind

185
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,190
when they said
essential functions only.

186
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,559
This is essential; I'm conducting
a murder investigation.

187
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,860
You're browsing Instagram.

188
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,645
BELL:
Guys,

189
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,397
I'm on rapid
response as of now,

190
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,066
but I managed to squeeze in
a few calls on the murder case.

191
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,618
I talked to someone
from Toshiwo,

192
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,036
the company that
makes the phones.

193
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,771
Wasn't good.

194
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,740
Normally they'd be able to
track down the missing batch

195
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,209
with GPS as soon as any of
the phones got activated,

196
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,877
but the New York
office is shut down.

197
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,462
Well, good idea.

198
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:04,298
Thoroughly unnecessary,
but good idea nonetheless.

199
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,752
Look at this.

200
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,887
BELL:
Posted 45 minutes ago?

201
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,006
These guys work fast.

202
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,624
It looks like there's a
line in the background.

203
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,842
That picture stamped
with a location?

204
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:15,893
It may as well be.

205
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,960
You see the shadow?

206
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,896
Yeah, looks like a shadow.

207
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:20,848
Direct your attention

208
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,983
to the curvature there.

209
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,801
The brutal postmodern sweep.

210
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,303
That is the amphitheater
at Columbus Park.

211
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,774
That is where they're
selling the phones from.

212
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,810
That's the real thing, man.

213
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,162
I can let you have it
for $75.

214
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,500
(whistle blowing)

215
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:41,836
Good afternoon, we are
employees of the NYPD.

216
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,655
We need a few moments
alone with this gentleman

217
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,157
to discuss stolen
cell phones.

218
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,324
Thank you.

219
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,095
Thank you.

220
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,633
Private Maggio,

221
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,353
you masterminded any slick
burglaries recently?

222
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,721
What?

223
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:03,140
No, I-I found
these phones, man.

224
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,776
Ain't nothing wrong
with selling them.

225
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,561
You found them?

226
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,280
Where?

227
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,015
Uh, Katy's,
the bakery on Beach Street.

228
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:15,169
The lady there gives me
their old scones.

229
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,654
I'm out back,

230
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,372
asleep in the alley,

231
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,291
and I hear this boom.

232
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,411
Sounds like something big
getting throw in the Dumpster.

233
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:27,164
So I get up
to check the old in-box,

234
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,051
and there's all these phones
right there on the bottom.

235
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,252
Hand to God.

236
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,803
Did you see who left them?

237
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,538
Couple of big
white dudes.

238
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,373
I only saw them
from behind

239
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,393
while they were running off
down the alley.

240
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:42,212
Listen, your
prices are too low.

241
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,433
Residents of this neighborhood,
they'd pay a bit more.

242
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:48,352
Get yourself a room tonight.

243
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,155
Come on.

244
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,557
Wait, you're just gonna
leave the phones there?

245
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,409
Well, the killers didn't care
about them.

246
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,445
Why should we?

247
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,330
No, the robbery of the phones
was a distraction

248
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,064
to put us off the scent
of whatever

249
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,900
they were really there
to steal.

250
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,570
Let's get back to the Flatiron
before the taxis pack it in.

251
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,339
REPORTER (on radio): The latest advisory
from the mayor's office

252
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,258
is urging citizens to return
to their homes immediately.

253
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,345
Hey, are you
listening to this?

254
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,514
The advisory
is for citizens.

255
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,466
We are not citizens.

256
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,134
We're detectives.

257
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:23,086
So if they weren't
the real target,

258
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:24,605
what was, hmm?

259
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:28,142
None of the other stores
in the lobby were robbed.

260
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:31,112
Must have gone upstairs.

261
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,599
But the stairs were locked.

262
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,869
The guard's elevator card
was still in his jacket.

263
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,605
You think they used it
and then put it back?

264
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,823
I think the thieves
didn't want us

265
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,125
to imagine they had access

266
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,442
to any other floors.

267
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,994
Don't you have
an app for that?

268
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,379
Power is at a premium, Watson.

269
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,581
Here.

270
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,137
Note the shiny scratches.

271
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,839
Someone was jittery
after they shot the guard.

272
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,558
They made a real hash of it.

273
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,127
See if I can do any better,
shall we?

274
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,147
Any luck,

275
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,767
and we'll find similar scratches
on another floor.

276
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,437
HOLMES: So, the killers picked
the lock in the lobby,

277
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,673
they walked up 12 flights
of stairs, they picked their way

278
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,642
into this foyer, all so they could
gain access to...

279
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,161
An architectural firm.

280
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:21,445
Mysteries abound.

281
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,747
Answers reside within.

282
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,866
Want to give it
a go this time?

283
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,818
(gasps)
MAN: Called the police,

284
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,620
and we don't have
anything to loot.

285
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,372
We're not here to loot
you; we <i>are</i> the police.

286
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,040
Let me see your badge, then.

287
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,325
Well... we're
<i>with</i> the police.

288
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,995
Look, we need to come in.
We mean you no harm.

289
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,763
And if you intend
to defend yourself

290
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,665
with that knife,
you're holding it all wrong.

291
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,669
My associate, Ms. Watson, she holds
several black belts.

292
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,004
I just figured, go camp out
at the office, you know,

293
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:48,890
get some work done.

294
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,939
It's nice, I've had
the place to myself since

295
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:51,776
I came in this morning.

296
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,195
Hey, we should really hurry it
up; it's getting bad out there.

297
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,146
Listen, man,
I'm telling you,

298
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,283
I haven't seen anything
out of place since I got here.

299
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,785
The computers and stuff,
they're all here.

300
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,154
That's not what they were after.

301
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,290
These drawers
not normally empty?

302
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,692
Yeah, no way, we're seriously
crimped for space.

303
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,861
Then they stole blueprints.
So they killed

304
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,195
a security guard
and stole a bunch

305
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,864
of smartphones as a
smoke screen so that

306
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,699
we wouldn't know that
they wanted a drawerful

307
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,051
of blueprints?
Interesting, isn't it?

308
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,202
Squatter, we need to know
what the numbers

309
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,371
9-2-Alpha-Uniform-5

310
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,508
to 9-4-Gulf-Yankee-2-3 mean.

311
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,477
It's year and job code.

312
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,046
Everything's listed online, but,
you know, the system's down.

313
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,181
We do keep all the plumbing and
electrical specs in the brown cabinets

314
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,983
over there.
I need the ones that correspond

315
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,519
to these missing blueprints
so I can see what was stolen.

316
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,604
I can't just give you

317
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,988
all of...
Tell me, do your employers

318
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,223
look kindly on
vagrancy, do they?

319
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,613
(groans softly):
Aw, damn it.

320
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,731
Do you want
to know what helps?

321
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:51,869
You just make a little tepee
out of the kindling, and it

322
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,421
acts like a chimney.
Oh.

323
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,340
Do you mind if I...

324
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,509
(laughs): Oh. Please.

325
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,929
(Watson sighs)

326
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,048
(phone rings)

327
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,433
Hey, I think your phone
is ringing.

328
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,218
Oh, that's Davis.

329
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,939
He won't stop until the
cell phone towers go down.

330
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,757
(ringing continues)
The guy who kicked you out?

331
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,061
He said he made a mistake.

332
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,363
He said
he wants me back.

333
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,984
But... he just wants
to stick me in some walk-up,

334
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:26,737
give me a clothing allowance.

335
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,773
I think it's fair to expect more
than that from a relationship.

336
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:34,578
Nice.

337
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,446
(knocking)
Merit badge.

338
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,666
DAVIS (calls): Baby!
I know you're in there! Now...

339
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:41,051
(knocking continues)
(whispers): It's Davis.

340
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:45,055
I know she's here.

341
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,974
I just need to talk
to her. Please.

342
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,309
I think you should go home.

343
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:52,346
DAVIS:
I love you, baby.

344
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,516
I'll leave her this time,
I swear.

345
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,518
It's okay.

346
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,687
(wind whistling)

347
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,473
WATSON: Hello?
(Davis and Ms. Hudson arguing)

348
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,776
HOLMES: I take it Mr. Renkin
has come a-courting?

349
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,161
(sighs):
So you noticed?

350
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,946
Why are you hiding in here?

351
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,832
Oh, be careful, I heated some
very large rocks on our grill.

352
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,983
They're in here for warmth.

353
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,835
Well, there is
a fire downstairs.

354
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,338
There's also a lovers' tiff,
and I need to work.

355
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,322
Now, these electrical schematics

356
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,542
match the blueprints
that were stolen.

357
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,993
Presumably, one of these places

358
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,346
is a target
for the thieves.

359
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,664
But viewed as a whole, they
comprise an incredibly mundane

360
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,932
roster of clients.

361
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,333
Unless the thieves are angling

362
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,969
to steal onesies
from a Baby Gap,

363
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,887
very difficult to see
what they're after.

364
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,639
Listen, if you're gonna
be up for a while,

365
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,608
will you keep your ears
open, because I don't know

366
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,894
if those two are making up
or breaking up forever.

367
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,846
Ow!

368
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,398
What?

369
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,567
Hot rock.

370
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,538
Come on, rise and shine.
Got to get going.

371
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,792
There's a <i>blizzard.</i>
Yeah, you should put on layers.

372
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,326
Now, come on, please,
time to get dressed.

373
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,862
It's not exactly gonna
happen with an audience.

374
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,214
Mm.

375
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,699
Are we fleeing from
the scene of a murder?

376
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,334
Because Ms. Hudson
and her boyfriend

377
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,837
were up half the night
yelling at each other.

378
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,139
They've progressed to
the "quiet conversation" stage.

379
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,373
Ms. Hudson assures me

380
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,892
he will be leaving
within the hour.

381
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,727
Now, I have ascertained
which building

382
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,430
designed by Masslin & Associates
the thieves intend to hit.

383
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,515
The answer is: none.

384
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,218
It seems like a conversation
that can wait until I'm <i>clothed.</i>

385
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
When I was reviewing
the accounting files,

386
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,656
I noticed that several
of the stolen blueprints

387
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,908
lacked the accompanying
plumbing schematics.

388
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,827
These are jobs
that Masslin & Associates

389
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,412
bid on but didn't get.

390
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:32,946
One of particular note.

391
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,643
A classified government job--
an addition to an existing

392
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,316
government building--

393
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:38,722
administered by the GSA.
What is that?

394
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,456
It's the government's thrilling
General Services Administration.

395
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,075
Now, architects approved
to bid on the addition,

396
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,744
they had access to
the building's original plans.

397
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,765
These plans were the real prize
the thieves were after.

398
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,101
So, what building
are they planning to hit?

399
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,853
EROC. That's an acronym:

400
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,638
East Rutherford
Operations Center.

401
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,190
It's a cash depository
and processing center for...

402
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,277
the New York branch
of the Federal Reserve,

403
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,429
home to the largest
cash vault in the world.

404
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,283
I do not think for a minute
the timing is an accident.

405
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,535
The thieves intend to use
the storm as a cover

406
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,621
and strike when security is
at dangerously depleted levels.

407
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:19,126
So they were waiting for a storm?
Yes. It's quite clever.

408
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:21,662
I mean, global weather
patterns are producing more

409
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,196
and more powerful storms.

410
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:25,358
You have a list of targets
and cities that are likely to be struck.

411
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:28,385
You have a plan in place
when the weather strikes.

412
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,054
The ensuing chaos when police
are otherwise engaged--

413
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,506
ideal time for a robbery.

414
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,007
Oh, good, you're ready.

415
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:36,677
(loud sigh)

416
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,011
Did you call
Captain Gregson yet?

417
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:40,063
I lost cell phone
service at 3:00 a.m.

418
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,482
The landline
is down as well,

419
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,684
and I cannibalized
the echo board on my CB radio

420
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:44,985
for an experiment
last week,

421
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,470
so we have <i>no</i> way
to contact the police.

422
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:51,074
We know that this team is
capable of murder when provoked.

423
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,160
We're gonna have
to stop this ourselves.

424
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,412
Hold on.
How are we gonna stop it?

425
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,698
I don't know-- I'll think
of something on the way.

426
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,784
It's a long trek
to East Rutherford.

427
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,337
(wind whistling)

428
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:34,997
(lively music playing
over radio)

429
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,422
Hello. Sorry.
Shouldn't you be plowing?

430
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,841
I'm on standby.
Who the hell are you?

431
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:47,509
My name's Sherlock Holmes.

432
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,594
This is my associate,

433
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:50,012
Joan Watson.

434
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,597
We're assisting the NYPD

435
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,799
with a matter
in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

436
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,685
Why is the NYPD helping
with something in Jersey?

437
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:57,937
It's a bit complicated.

438
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,438
Well, do you mind if we come in,

439
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,390
just to escape
this bone-freezing agony?

440
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:03,108
Come on.

441
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,443
Thank you.

442
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:08,096
(lively music continues)

443
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:09,231
(groans)

444
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,867
Oh! (exhales)

445
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,569
(turns off music)
Oh, thank you.

446
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:16,538
Hey, hey, I was listening to that.
HOLMES: Right.

447
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,957
Would you raise the police?

448
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,209
We need to speak
to the 11th precinct, please.

449
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,377
It's rather urgent.

450
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,629
Breaker Nine,
this is Pam

451
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:26,281
calling from a plow
truck in Greenpoint.

452
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:28,801
I need police dispatch,
11th precinct.

453
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,619
(brief radio static)

454
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:33,589
On the line for a bear
with ears. Come back.

455
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,258
Your CB handle is "Pam"?

456
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,126
DISPATCHER: Copy, Pam.
This is the 11th precinct.

457
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,763
You're on the emergency channel.
State your business.

458
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:43,849
This is Sherlock Holmes,
guest of Pam

459
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,468
and consultant with NYPD.

460
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,320
Need to speak
with Captain Gregson.

461
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:51,023
I can't put you on
with Captain Gregson, sir.

462
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,976
He's not here at the station.
There's a storm.

463
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:55,744
A storm, you say?

464
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,080
We shall be on the lookout.

465
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:00,649
Could you give him this message?

466
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:05,087
Fairly certain E-R-O-C
will be robbed today.

467
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,957
Connected
to security guard murder.

468
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,843
Sherlock Holmes. Over.

469
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,344
(brief radio static)
Right.

470
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,346
We need to get
to East Rutherford, New Jersey.

471
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:16,015
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I thought the whole reason

472
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:18,667
we left the house was because
we could not reach the police.

473
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,103
Well, we have no idea if they're
going to get the message.

474
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:22,805
Or if the authorities
can seem to spare the manpower

475
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:24,673
if, by some miracle,
they do get the message.

476
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,809
And we don't even have
any proof. No,

477
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:28,753
the most sensible course is
for us to go to EROC ourselves.

478
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:30,113
And do what?

479
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,513
What if there are
50 commandos

480
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,782
shooting up the place?
Well, I have my whistle.

481
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,350
I don't know what's
gonna happen next!

482
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,119
That's what makes
this an adventure.

483
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,738
But someone has to try and race
ahead and warn the guards.

484
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,408
So, Pam, very sorry to do this,
but we're commandeering

485
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,294
this vehicle on behalf
of the NYPD. And let's go.

486
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:46,662
You, get out.

487
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:49,631
You, I can give a ride
home to if you want.

488
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:52,217
All right,
forget the commandeering.

489
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:55,587
Let's just call it a rental,
shall we?

490
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:02,044
Hey, uh...

491
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,395
Vince?
Yeah.

492
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:04,546
Yeah. Detective Bell.

493
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:06,365
I radioed in
a little while ago.

494
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,734
Uh, I think we spoke.
I double-checked.

495
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,736
We haven't had
a gunshot victim in two weeks.

496
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,237
Right. No,

497
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:14,106
but here's the thing,
none of the hospitals

498
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:16,058
near the shooting
had anybody come in,

499
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,410
so now I'm just making the rounds
looking for a patient

500
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,446
with any kind of abdominal wound.
Thought maybe

501
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:22,898
the person I'm looking
for came in with a different story.

502
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,084
Well, it's hard to explain
you got a bullet wound

503
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:26,401
by falling down the stairs.

504
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:27,753
Give me a break, man.

505
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:31,423
I got 20 minutes off
from snow patrol.

506
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:33,258
Um...

507
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:36,578
Um...

508
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,415
we do have one young woman.

509
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,518
She's about to be discharged.
She was stabbed.

510
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,969
Alysa Darvin.

511
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,220
Hm.

512
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,556
(knocking)
I'm decent.

513
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:49,308
Ms. Darvin?

514
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,710
Detective Bell, NYPD.

515
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:53,812
Oh. I thought
you were a nurse.

516
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:56,598
They keep stopping by trying
to talk me out of leaving.

517
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,067
Yeah, why <i>are</i> you leaving?

518
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:00,035
No health insurance.
Nobody can say for sure

519
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:01,269
that they won't charge me

520
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,938
if I stay through
the storm, so...

521
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,989
(quiet groan)

522
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:06,875
I'm all stitched up.

523
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:08,627
So, is this
good news?

524
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:10,129
You guys find
the bastard?

525
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:11,279
Hm?

526
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:14,500
(laughs):
Well... the mugger.

527
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:16,718
The guy who stabbed me.

528
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,138
No, sorry.
This is about something else.

529
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,974
Parking tickets?

530
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:24,126
No, no, you're not
in any trouble. I just...

531
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:26,395
You mind if I take a look
at your chart?

532
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:28,463
Yeah.

533
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:34,119
Two lacerations.

534
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,387
Ouch.

535
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,156
Can you tell me
what happened?

536
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:39,691
Well, uh... okay.
Well, um,

537
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:43,478
this guy with a beard,
he steps out with a kitchen knife.

538
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,980
I gave him my purse, but...

539
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:47,249
he said I was mouthy.

540
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:48,367
You have a...

541
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:50,452
blond hair on your coat.

542
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:54,339
Yeah, I loaned it to my friend
last week, so... must be hers.

543
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:05,934
Okay.

544
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,972
Just one
more question.

545
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:13,392
What hurt worse, getting shot
or letting your friend stab you

546
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:15,277
to disguise the wound?

547
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,396
What?

548
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,181
You see that?

549
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:20,199
It's melted.

550
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,450
Real hair doesn't do that.

551
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:22,868
It came from a wig.

552
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,536
Like the one
you were wearing

553
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:26,905
when you shot
a security guard last night.

554
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:29,191
I don't know what
you're talking about.

555
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:31,743
Right. Well, since you're
checking out anyway,

556
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to insist on giving you a ride.

557
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:38,033
(handcuffs rattle)

558
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:40,669
PAM:
<i>So, you're with the NYPD</i>

559
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:42,471
but you're not cops.

560
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:44,640
How does that
work, exactly?

561
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,041
We met your price, Pam.

562
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:49,645
I assumed it included
freedom from small talk.

563
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:55,350
He gets carsick,
like a six-year-old.

564
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:57,069
We consult.

565
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,655
Oh, I got a bar;
I'm gonna try the home line,

566
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:02,157
see if the landlines
are working now, maybe.

567
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,443
Why on earth
would you call our house?

568
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,612
Well, because every time I call
the police I get a weird signal.

569
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:08,203
I just want to make sure that
Davis is out of the house

570
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:09,415
and Ms. Hudson is okay.

571
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:12,417
WOMAN (recorded): The number
you have dialed is not in service.

572
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,587
Please check the number
and try again.

573
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:16,838
The number is
out of service,

574
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,457
and it is not
because of an emergency.

575
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,342
Do you have any idea
why that would be...

576
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:22,844
Did you not pay
the phone bill?

577
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,763
In this day and age
a landline

578
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,882
is like an appendix
or a vestigial tail.

579
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:28,483
I don't know
why you care anyway.

580
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:30,686
Yesterday you complained
when I took Ms. Hudson in.

581
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,638
Yesterday I was upset because
you brought a stranger

582
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,606
into our shared living space
without asking.

583
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,058
Today she's
no longer a stranger.

584
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,693
I like Ms. Hudson.

585
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:38,927
You know, she's lost.
She's just trying

586
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,646
to figure herself out.
You identify with her.

587
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:42,076
She's like you were
before you met me.

588
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:42,899
What?

589
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,150
HOLMES: Lost, trying to figure yourself out.
No, I reject

590
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,818
that analogy.
I just want to help her.

591
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,704
I think it would
be good if Ms. Hudson

592
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:51,156
learned to take care
of herself, that's all.

593
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:54,793
Well done, Pam.
We're here.

594
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,335
MAN:
Little early for a plow,

595
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:05,620
isn't it?
Still coming down.

596
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,139
We're not here
to shovel snow.

597
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:08,390
There's an emergency.

598
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:14,680
You want to know why
today's your lucky day?

599
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:17,799
Normally these tests don't
take any time at all.

600
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,519
But... we got no power.

601
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,404
Can't run the test.

602
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:27,475
Means you have a little
window to be smart here.

603
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:30,445
If you're ready to tell me
what I already know--

604
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:32,314
that you killed Frank Dempster,

605
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:35,334
that you and your buddies stole
200 Verzia 8 phones--

606
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:37,819
I'll get a D.A. in here
and cut you a deal.

607
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,288
You know what,
why don't you shove...

608
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,591
GREGSON:
Sorry to interrupt, but...

609
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:46,378
sounded like a no.

610
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,848
So... let's
switch gears.

611
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,002
Why don't you tell us
about EROC.

612
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:55,904
MAN:
<i>You say you're with the NYPD,</i>

613
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,557
but we can't raise anybody
on the radio to confirm that.

614
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,509
HOLMES: They're a bit busy dealing
with the storm of the century.

615
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,445
Well, be that as it
may, there's no way

616
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:04,896
we're letting you past
the control room.

617
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:07,032
Nobody gets past
the control room.

618
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:10,535
This entire facility
is automated, Mr. Holmes.

619
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:13,071
Most days, nobody's allowed
on the cash floor.

620
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:15,791
Automated vehicles--
our AGVs--

621
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:17,542
they unload pallets of bills

622
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:19,527
from the armored trucks
that bring in the deposits.

623
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,196
Then they take them
into the vaults

624
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:23,215
for processing and storage.

625
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,834
It's all commanded remotely
from rooms like these.

626
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:28,337
There's no way...
no chance

627
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:31,873
you could get into
our vault directly.

628
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,043
Huh.

629
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,395
Is something wrong?

630
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:37,929
Nothing. It's all there
and accounted for.

631
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:41,650
I just didn't realize
they were doing a sort today.

632
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:44,369
Steve, did you hear about this?
Machines ran about 980.

633
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,021
An unscheduled,
unsupervised sort

634
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:48,907
of nearly a billion dollars
run on auxiliary power.

635
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:51,026
Okay, yes, it's
weird, but...

636
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,828
nothing's missing.

637
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,697
All the bills that ran through
the machines are accounted for.

638
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,249
System's tamperproof.

639
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,368
You destroy currency at
this facility, do you not?

640
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,119
Sure, if a bill gets
too worn out

641
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,337
it gets sifted out and shredded.

642
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:04,573
Can we see where?

643
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:06,241
The money's already been
shredded, has it not?

644
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:09,211
Ms. Watson and myself are not
here to steal confetti.

645
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:12,347
MAN: Our processing machines read
70,000 bills an hour.

646
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:14,850
These bills are
from this morning's shred.

647
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:18,603
Just under $33 million.

648
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:20,138
That's about average
for four hours.

649
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,423
It's all here.

650
00:26:21,425 --> 00:26:23,692
(spits) Something was
shredded here this morning,

651
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:25,944
but it's not U.S. currency.

652
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:27,729
This is supposed
to be cotton.

653
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:29,731
This is regular paper.
This is fake.

654
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,950
That's not possible.
Well, you be sure to mention that

655
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:34,486
in your exit
interview. Yeah.

656
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:36,455
Well, it's hard to say
how the thieves got in,

657
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:38,123
not without access to the
blueprints they stole.

658
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,875
But they got into
your control room,

659
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:41,877
they looped the security footage,
and they gave themselves

660
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,712
run of the place-- they
switched out the bales

661
00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:45,831
that were meant to
be shredded with fake currency.

662
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,549
That doesn't make any sense.
If they got in,

663
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,000
they could've taken
as much as they wanted.

664
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:50,785
HOLMES: But not without
risking detection,

665
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:53,388
inviting a massive manhunt.
If these bales

666
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,357
had gone to the landfill
as you'd intended,

667
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,925
no one would even know
there'd been a crime here.

668
00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:59,261
So we're not trying
to prevent a robbery;

669
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:00,929
we're trying to
find these people

670
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:04,149
before they disappear
with $33 million.

671
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:14,389
WATSON: It's freezing out.
What are we looking at?

672
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:15,930
HOLMES: Since she chose
the shed

673
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,536
at the most remote
point of access to unlock.

674
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:20,020
Look at this. See the
discoloration there?

675
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:23,074
Rather than break down the door,
they've unscrewed the keypad,

676
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,993
they wired in and then
reattached it on their way out.

677
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:28,079
Left hardly a trace.

678
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,030
We're standing
over a tunnel.

679
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,549
Yeah.

680
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,134
Without question,

681
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:36,071
this was our point of ingress
and egress onto the property.

682
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,100
Well, it looks like
someone's been smoking here.

683
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:39,974
You think it's normally guarded?

684
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:42,426
Huh. Unless a
massive storm

685
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,045
forces them to work
with a skeleton crew.

686
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,715
You have to admire
the ingenuity of the plan.

687
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,350
If they hadn't killed someone,

688
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:53,270
I'd have half a mind
to let them get away with it.

689
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,339
They came out of EROC with
$33 million in small bills.

690
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:14,241
They loaded their haul
into an ambulance--

691
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:15,626
American-made in the late '90s.

692
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:16,777
They haven't been gone

693
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,879
more than an hour.

694
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,427
WATSON: The driver had a lazy eye,
the other two met

695
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:23,850
at basketball camp,
and one has canine lupus.

696
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,221
You see how it feels?

697
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:29,106
Just tell me how you know.

698
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,525
Well... just...

699
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,729
These tire tracks,

700
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,264
they're varying axle bases.
The front wheels,

701
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,532
little bit
closer together.

702
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,067
That is a very
rare configuration.

703
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:41,368
It's common only
in ambulances

704
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,936
and certain U-Haul-
style box trucks.

705
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:45,122
Now, if I was trying to
make my way unimpeded

706
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,841
through a storm-locked
area, I'd rather be

707
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:50,277
in an ambulance
than a U-Haul. Wouldn't you?

708
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,047
Two inches of snow
are falling every hour.

709
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:55,015
Those tracks would
be impossible to see,

710
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,752
unless they were here within what,
the last 90 minutes or so?

711
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:58,919
Very good, Watson.

712
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,287
And given
the current conditions,

713
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,140
it's not too late
to catch them.

714
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,760
GREGSON:
Do you know we have

715
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:08,979
a satellite phone linkup to
other law enforcement agencies?

716
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,233
It's so we can stay in touch
in case of emergencies.

717
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:15,903
BELL: Alysa Darvin, the name
you used at the hospital,

718
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:17,822
it's an alias.
You dropped it before.

719
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,607
Your real name
is Elle Bastin.

720
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:21,242
You were born
in Marseilles.

721
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:24,111
You got dual citizenship
with arrests for larceny

722
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:26,614
in Germany and Portugal.

723
00:29:26,616 --> 00:29:31,652
Your husband, Ibn Casimir,
was in on both jobs.

724
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:34,705
Is that why
you won't talk to us?

725
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:36,757
'Cause you're married
to a guy who decided,

726
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,093
go ahead with the robbery
after you got shot?

727
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,545
GREGSON:
Elle...

728
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,330
tell us what
he's up to,

729
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:44,998
where we can find him.

730
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,352
Otherwise, you're gonna
eat a murder charge alone.

731
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,356
(French accent):
You will never find my husband.

732
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:55,359
MAN:
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

733
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:58,262
There's someone named Sherlock
Holmes on the radio for you.

734
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,564
He says EROC's
already been robbed.

735
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:08,706
(door closes)

736
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,291
HOLMES:
<i>You found the murderess?</i>

737
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:13,160
GREGSON: Yeah, the murderess
is name Elle Bastin.

738
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:15,028
Detective Bell's
been talking to Interpol.

739
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,197
They say she's got
four plane tickets

740
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,868
booked out of BWI day after
tomorrow; headed to Belize.

741
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,088
HOLMES: And on to a non-extradition
country from there, I assume.

742
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,723
The good news is,

743
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:26,925
if they're flying commercially

744
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,709
they will have to unload
the money first.

745
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:32,763
$33 million in cash takes up
enormous physical space.

746
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:35,048
At the moment, they're carrying
it in the back of an ambulance.

747
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,902
What was she carrying on her
when you arrested her?

748
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,687
BELL:
Uh, not much.

749
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:41,856
She had a burner on her
when I found her,

750
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,574
but the texts
are limited right now.

751
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:45,993
Only managed to pull the last
dozen numbers she dialed.

752
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,945
You can use a reverse directory.

753
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,114
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my first day, Holmes.

754
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,783
I did. She mostly called
friends and family.

755
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:55,402
There were a couple to
Oak Knoll out in Queens.

756
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,588
Who did she call
at the racetrack?

757
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,623
A guy named Joseph Leseur.

758
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,792
He's the Director of
Thoroughbred Racing over there.

759
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,911
Well, Detective,
what would you do if you had

760
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:06,213
an enormous amount
of old, worn-out bills

761
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:07,848
with old serial numbers?

762
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,301
<i>I</i> would swap them out
with nice new clean ones,

763
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,585
little bit at a time.

764
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:13,587
Especially if I
had a contact who worked

765
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:16,423
in one of the largest-volume
cash businesses there is.

766
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:20,945
Tell me, can we get an address
for Mr. Leseur?

767
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,038
Who's driving you around?

768
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,239
Pam.

769
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:34,275
So, what have
you learned?

770
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:37,294
Well, none of the, uh, neighbors
spotted an ambulance

771
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,713
driving up to Leseur's house.

772
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:43,500
If they plan on coming here,
they haven't done it yet.

773
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:48,005
Takes time to move $33 million
around a paralyzed city.

774
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,807
Mm.

775
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,811
Do you know where the term
"stakeout" comes from?

776
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,763
No, but I'm guessing
I'm about to find out.

777
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:58,732
DISPATCHER: All units, be advised that
a Stuyvesant Memorial ambulance

778
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:01,018
just passed the road closure
and is driving east

779
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,319
across the City Island Bridge.

780
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,471
Copy that.
Let them through.

781
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:07,691
We'll arrest everybody after
they pull up to Leseur's place.

782
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:11,578
(vehicle approaching)

783
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,916
BELL:
Hold it.

784
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,620
Wait for the exchange.

785
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,542
(rings doorbell)

786
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,311
OFFICER: Detective,
I think one of the EMTs

787
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,029
just clocked me.
I'm going in.

788
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,716
(sirens wailing)

789
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:44,311
OFFICER:
Get on the ground now!

790
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:46,313
MAN: What the hell are
you guys doing?!

791
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:48,365
Don't move. You're under arrest.
For what?!

792
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,734
We got a nonemergency
call to this address.

793
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,703
You telling me
you don't have $33 million

794
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,154
in the back of that ambulance?

795
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:55,656
What?!
Of course not!

796
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,371
Stretcher,
medical supplies.

797
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:14,658
Street value, maybe
a few thousand, but hey,

798
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,927
it's not like we're busy
today or anything.

799
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,732
I don't understand.

800
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,567
We've been duped.

801
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:35,859
HOLMES:
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

802
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,027
We were waiting for a Stuyvesant
Memorial ambulance,

803
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,113
and even though there was
no emergency

804
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:41,347
at Joseph Leseur's house,

805
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:42,949
Stuyvesant Memorial
ambulance showed up.

806
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:44,284
Now, that can't be
a coincidence.

807
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:46,402
So, taking odds,
you think that

808
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:49,038
Davis has shacked up
with Ms. Hudson or not?

809
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,024
Uh, hey, listen.
This was pretty fun.

810
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:54,244
If you ever need,
you know, a snowplow

811
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:55,545
for hire again...

812
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,964
give me a call.

813
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:01,885
(sighs)

814
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:10,560
(sighs)

815
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,730
Oh, my God!

816
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:16,232
It's spotless.

817
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:17,400
HUDSON:
Don't hate me.

818
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,385
Hate you?
I love you.

819
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:22,772
How's it arranged?

820
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:24,073
By subject matter,

821
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,359
then by author.

822
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:28,361
You start with
hard sciences

823
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:30,747
on the north wall,
and then you move

824
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,248
clockwise around the room

825
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,901
in descending order
of academic rigor.

826
00:34:35,903 --> 00:34:38,504
That way,

827
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:41,174
<i>Physics</i>
by Aristotle is as far away

828
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:46,179
from <i>You Can Learn Telepathy</i> by
Morton Zuckerman as possible.

829
00:34:46,181 --> 00:34:47,597
That's reasonable.

830
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,849
Oh, and I stacked
your monographs

831
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:52,268
that you wrote on your desk.

832
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,803
I liked the one

833
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:55,388
about queen bees.

834
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,223
(chuckles)

835
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,475
WATSON:
I'm impressed.

836
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,728
I have a touch of OCD.

837
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,665
Seems to flare up
after a breakup.

838
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,982
Davis?

839
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:08,934
He stayed over
the first night, but...

840
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,988
our thing wasn't
really healthy.

841
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,456
Or happy.

842
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,993
I think maybe I have to take
another look at that whole

843
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,962
"kept woman" thing.

844
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:25,134
Why does Clyde have tape
on his back?

845
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:27,337
It's a cross.
He's an ambulance.

846
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,005
He's <i>the</i> ambulance.

847
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,223
Oh, I see.

848
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:32,308
So, the locks are checkpoints
and road closures?

849
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,761
Mm. According
to Captain Gregson,

850
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:37,230
we have reason to believe
that Ibn Casimir

851
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:41,184
and his compatriots
were... here

852
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:42,652
at 3:00.

853
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,103
That's when multiple
eyewitnesses report

854
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,655
seeing a Stuyvesant
Memorial ambulance

855
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:48,408
flagrantly disregarding
a severe traffic accident

856
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,193
on Soundview Terrace.

857
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:52,144
It's odd for an ambulance

858
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:54,580
to ignore those
in distress.

859
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:57,583
Less strange if it is carrying
$33 million in cash

860
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,452
instead of
medical supplies.

861
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:02,171
Let's presume the
thieves learned

862
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,823
that we were looking
for them.

863
00:36:03,825 --> 00:36:06,009
They call in a
false distress signal

864
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:07,510
to Joseph Leseur's house,

865
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:11,330
and then they take their
stolen cargo elsewhere.

866
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:13,800
It's hard to see where
they could have gone.

867
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:16,502
I mean, every cop
was looking for them at that point.

868
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:19,272
Mm, exactly.
And what's more,

869
00:36:19,274 --> 00:36:21,641
the streets were a maze of
emergency checkpoints.

870
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:24,894
The whole city was
virtually locked down.

871
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:28,231
I like what you did
with the-the locks and everything.

872
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,984
I'm not trying
to create a visual pun.

873
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:33,319
I'm trying to see how

874
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,871
an ambulance could have got
anywhere,

875
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,489
even a decent hiding place,

876
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,858
when there was quite literally
nowhere for it to turn.

877
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,577
It seems impossible. The only way
it could have gotten anywhere

878
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,529
is if those checkpoints
and road closures weren't there.

879
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:44,747
But they <i>were</i> there.

880
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,532
You can't just
wish them away

881
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:49,402
with a wave of your...
What?

882
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:52,221
<i>Most</i> people can't just wish
them away

883
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:54,724
with a wave of their hand.

884
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:58,327
GREGSON:
So, the stapler's the ambulance?

885
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:01,898
Yeah, It was was a tortoise
last night. Bear with me.

886
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,435
These stickers represent
the checkpoints and closures.

887
00:37:05,437 --> 00:37:08,704
We know that the ambulance
driven by Ibn Casimir

888
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:12,909
and his associates
was spotted here yesterday.

889
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:15,495
We do not know how
it got out of the city.

890
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:18,831
Ms. Watson has a copy of
yesterday's dispatch log.

891
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,234
A commendable attempt to catalog
the blizzard's madness.

892
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:25,738
Ms. Watson, would you please
read the events in question?

893
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,091
Yes, of course. Um, at 3:32,

894
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:30,626
a stretch of St. Ann's Avenue
was reopened

895
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:32,261
when officers manning
a checkpoint

896
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:33,763
were reassigned
to Garvey Park.

897
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:37,583
3:45. Police officers
at the Triborough Bridge

898
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:39,635
were directed to investigate
reports of a fire

899
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:41,687
that turned out
to be false.

900
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:44,724
At ten to 4:00, the checkpoint
at Astoria and 31st

901
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,926
was deemed unnecessary
and shut down.

902
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:48,945
Yes, now, see, there's more.
There's many, many more.

903
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,613
But you, uh, you get the idea.

904
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:54,066
A series of personnel maneuvers,
on their own, unremarkable,

905
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:56,435
but you consider them
as a whole,

906
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:59,271
they add up to quite a tidy
escape route out of New York.

907
00:37:59,273 --> 00:38:02,775
You think someone was playing
Moses, parting the Red Sea?

908
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:07,163
If you're right, they've got
a high-level player inside.

909
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:11,834
So how's it been,
working with Mrs. Castor?

910
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,387
It's fine.
She's tough.

911
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:15,621
Knows her job.

912
00:38:15,623 --> 00:38:17,423
Sharp enough to be
able to arrange

913
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:20,810
the chessboard without
arousing suspicion.

914
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:23,095
Do you know what

915
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:26,599
a FEMA Emergency Response
Administrator is paid in salary?

916
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:29,301
She's GS-13 on the
government pay scale.

917
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:30,603
It is <i>not</i> exorbitant.

918
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:32,071
I don't make a fortune either.

919
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:33,806
You want to make
a citizen's arrest?

920
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:37,126
I am merely suggesting a motive.
She is paid the same amount

921
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:41,164
as the postmaster
of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

922
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,366
Perhaps she decided
she needed a raise.

923
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:44,483
That's all very
interesting,

924
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:45,985
but we don't
have a case.

925
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:48,337
All I can point to
is the few instances

926
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:49,589
of her doing her job.

927
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:51,340
Now our thieves are gone,

928
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:53,709
and the one we've
got isn't talking.

929
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,295
Oh. Why do you
think Ms. Bastin

930
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:58,014
has decided not
to bargain with us?

931
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:01,217
I suppose it's possible in her
case there is honor among thieves.

932
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,219
But it's also possible that
she's holding onto

933
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:04,804
her most valuable
bargaining chip:

934
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:07,390
the identity of a corrupt
government employee

935
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:09,892
until she is quite certain
that her inside contact

936
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:14,146
cannot facilitate her escape.

937
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:17,016
I don't know about you,
I'm quite hoping her faith

938
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:20,036
in that remote possibility
is redeemed.

939
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:30,713
(sighs)

940
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:34,133
Do you know what a Mass
Spectrometer is, Elle?

941
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:37,253
Truth is, I don't really know
how the thing works myself,

942
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,639
so I'm not the best person
to explain it, but I'll try.

943
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:42,875
Here goes: a Mass Spectrometer
is the thing

944
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:44,477
that just ruined your life.

945
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:47,563
The GSR test came back.

946
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:51,100
You had gunshot residue
all over your right palm.

947
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,319
You're going down for
the murder of Frank Dempster.

948
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,738
We're gonna put you away
for life.

949
00:39:58,075 --> 00:40:03,162
Guess the backup generator
wasn't built for the long haul.

950
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:05,998
Oh, right, I was talking about
how they're clearing the roads

951
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,451
and you're about to be transferred
to Central Booking.

952
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:11,420
(men shouting indistinctly)

953
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,339
What's going on?

954
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,459
Somebody got stabbed
in the holding cells

955
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,410
during the blackout. Come on.
You, too. Let's go.

956
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:20,796
Shouldn't somebody
keep an eye on her?

957
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:23,349
Come on. The door's gonna lock
from the outside.

958
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,101
Ms. Bastin's not going anywhere.

959
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,855
Detective Bell once confided
he played Sky Masterson

960
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:32,775
in his high school
production

961
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:34,426
of <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

962
00:40:34,428 --> 00:40:38,030
I had not, until this moment,
imagined that he was any good.

963
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:42,785
The stage's loss is New York
City's gain, I suppose.

964
00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:44,704
GREGSON (on radio):
How we looking, Holmes?

965
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:47,657
Nothing yet.

966
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:48,941
How's the riot?

967
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:50,910
(officers shouting)

968
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:13,399
Not a word.
Follow me.

969
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,267
Here we go.

970
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,656
The happy collaborators
are on their way out, Captain.

971
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:22,992
Okay.

972
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:24,327
Wait, wait.

973
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:25,611
We can't charge them
with escape

974
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:26,996
until they clear
the floor.

975
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,165
(shouting continues)

976
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:38,424
You didn't say anything
to them, did you?

977
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:40,710
Say anything about what?

978
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:45,348
♪

979
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:57,526
Hey, Gregson
just called.

980
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:59,061
Denise Castor turned
on her partners.

981
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:00,446
Turns out the ambulance

982
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:02,417
and the cash were in a
garage in Rockaway.

983
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:03,233
Wonderful.

984
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:05,701
Oh, redecorating
already?

985
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:09,121
(horn honking)

986
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,074
Uh, what's Pam doing here?

987
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:14,126
Ms. Hudson needs a ride
to her cousin's.

988
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:16,295
Some of the roads
still a bit dicey.

989
00:42:16,297 --> 00:42:18,130
That's me.

990
00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:19,382
Thank you.

991
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:20,800
I'll see you Tuesday.

992
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:23,469
What's Tuesday?

993
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:26,038
Ms. Hudson needs some cash
while she figures out

994
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,339
her next move.
I've engaged her

995
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:29,041
to clean the place on
a weekly basis.

996
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:30,426
Oh.

997
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:34,930
That's very considerate.

998
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:36,899
I wasn't going to do
it myself, was I?

999
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:38,234
And you've decided
to take on

1000
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:39,735
some extra casework
to cover her fees.

1001
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:42,238
Excuse me.
We never agreed to that.

1002
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,739
Well, 50-50, then.

1003
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:48,227
Now, come back in ten minutes,
wear a blindfold.

1004
00:42:48,229 --> 00:42:49,728
The bloodstains will
be ready,

1005
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,630
and the lesson can begin.
