1
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,396
I got Russia, Evie.

2
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:32,866
Did you hear me?
I got Russia.

3
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,446
Great, Dad.

4
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:41,824
I'm turning in.

5
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,754
Good night, Daddy.

6
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,254
Good night.

7
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:53,673
You're listening to Dick Dondair.
This is "Lime Hour."

8
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:58,601
This song was from Buddy
to his own beloved Tammy.

9
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:03,855
The same goes for Laura from Dexter.
He says to forget last night, it'll never happen again.

10
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,525
I believe him.

11
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,200
It's midnight here in Sweetheart Land,
and this next one is for Emily from Billy.

12
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,326
Come on outta there.

13
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,411
Why you have to bug me so?

14
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:04,416
It is nine o'clock.
Get your butt movin'.

15
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:08,632
Leave me alone, Mom.
Take off the Walk-Man.

16
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,971
Hey, kids.

17
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:11,574
Evie! Evie Decker!

18
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,951
Take off your head
when I'm talking to you.

19
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:23,168
Let me have thoses headphones.
Pronto, Tonto.

20
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:28,844
Let's see your buns...

21
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:31,181
hotdog buns.

22
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:42,562
These buns are to be laid out neatly,
light side up, dark side down.

23
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,617
Hand warm and ready to serve.

24
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:49,741
Put your head on when I'm talking to you. Think of the children, for Chirst's sake.

25
00:05:56,296 --> 00:06:01,717
Evie. I didn't like your attitude back
when you worked in the gift shop.

26
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:06,839
Now you shape up, or you can hop right outta here, for good.

27
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,517
You are way too qualified
to be a rabbit.

28
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,059
If you hate your job so much,
why don't you just quit?

29
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:22,062
It's not just the job, Violet.
I felt this way at the Dairy Queen.

30
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:26,411
How much longer, Vi?
About 5 more minutes, Hon.

31
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,906
I'm turning it up to "broil."

32
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,875
Don't look up, don't look up. Be like you're talking to me.
- I was talking.

33
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,384
It's Jeff Wright.
Can you bear to see him?

34
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:44,549
Even he's getting outta here.

35
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,481
You ever feel like it wouldn't matter if you lived or died?

36
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,980
Pardon?

37
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,614
I could disappear,
and no one would notice.

38
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:17,549
One two three four, -

39
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:21,009
five, six, seven, -

40
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,712
eight nine.

41
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:58,502
It's Evie.

42
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,633
I must have dozed off.

43
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,565
Did you pick up your prescription?

44
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,900
No, I meant to.

45
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:27,498
There is too much Spanish in the world.

46
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,710
I'll get it after work.

47
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,087
There's cocoa in the kitchen.

48
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,849
That was Bruce Springsteen singing
"Jersey Girl."

49
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,016


50
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:49,806
That's from Lyle to his Carolina girl, Janice. His heart is on his sleeve.

51
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:53,607
And also from Mary Cline to Grady. Her cup runneth over.

52
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,691
So give her a call, Grady, only don't wait too long.

53
00:08:56,907 --> 00:09:03,028
You're on the air with Dick Dondair,
and this is 89 sweetheart time, WWLV. in love.

54
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:08,871
I'm sitting here with my guest, our own up-and-coming man of romance, Mr. Bertram Casey.

55
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:13,131
He'll be appearing live this Saturday night
at the Plaza Theater.

56
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:16,841
Welcome to the show Bert.
- Drumstrings.

57
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:22,264
Sorry, say what?
I go by "Drumstrings."

58
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:26,889
OK, Drumstrings, it says here in my notes that you live right here in Farinia. Is that so?

59
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:31,733
Heh, you don't live in Farinia, you die here.
I'm gettin' out.

60
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:36,239
It's a good area, such high hopes.
Hope's got nothing to do with it.

61
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,578
Well let's see then, have you done much recording, Drumsticks?

62
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:43,325
Drumstrings. No.

63
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,541
What is it you do, exactly?

64
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,828
Do you want to know what I do?

65
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,044
We've all got our own way of fighting off the devil.

66
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,423
I write, sing, play guitar.

67
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,886
Why not call you "Guitarstrings" then?

68
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,265
I want too much

69
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,061
and I want you

70
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,320
when I hope I woke I want too much

71
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:23,953
when you try
to save yourself

72
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,538
and I hope I you don't
I want too much.

73
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:33,759
Well I'm thinking you do, Pal.

74
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:37,635
You think you're invisible,
but I see you.

75
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,719
You break, you bend.

76
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:46,348
You disappear. Everybody is staring.
Maybe we should go farther.

77
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:50,516
And then again, maybe we shouldn't.
Now back to music from this planet.

78
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,229
We've got some Michael Bolton.

79
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,032
You don't know me now, Dick,
but you will.

80
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,583
Sorry...

81
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,635
Sorry...

82
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:32,399
He's not like these people.

83
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:53,633
That's a diaper pin in her ear.

84
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,425
Wait.

85
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:06,019
It's him.

86
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:30,500
Here comes the night
there go your knees

87
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,804
reaching for the floor

88
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:40,433
you say I'll stand guard down here
she stands in the door

89
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:44,016
with a pony on the tether

90
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:48,813
pulling cold and sugar cane

91
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:59,115
there go your knees

92
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:05,623
and there she goes

93
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,101
Take a deep breath.
I got a mirror and a good idea.

94
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:21,229
You say your eyes  are speaking now

95
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:25,486
Should I say what you did?
Are you mute?

96
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:28,566
Should I say what you did?

97
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:31,618
Are you mute?

98
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,706
I feel like I've heard him before.
Yeah, you did, on the radio.

99
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,122
It's wierd, but I feel like I know him.

100
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:47,215
Have I gotta say it?
Have I gotta say it?

101
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,925
I want to answer him.

102
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:32,850
I could have sworn I saw you and that Parker
friend of yours at the concert the other night.

103
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,643
I was there with Violet.
No shit?

104
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,597
Hey, unzip me, will you?

105
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:48,651
Ah, working at that peas wheel makes me sick.

106
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,864
What d'you...what d'you?
Ah, sweet Jesus.

107
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:02,999
What'd you think of
Drumstrings Casey?

108
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:09,007
Well I don't know what the fuck he's jabbering about,
but with a body like that...-

109
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,260
...who cares?

110
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,144
I've got something for you.

111
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:32,206
What's this?
It's Drumstrings Casey, who do you think?

112
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,950
I did it one night at the Unicorn.

113
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,206
It's a pretty good likeness, don't you think?

114
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:44,544
Easy, peanut. Spas'.

115
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:53,598
What'd I tell you? Here she is.
Yeah, raft and all.

116
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,734
Look who's here.

117
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:00,268
Where do you think you are going?

118
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:03,654
I'll show you around.

119
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,802
Follow me.

120
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:02,590
I'll see you in my
wet dreams, baby.

121
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:16,144
He is so hot. Looks like he's packin'
a summer squash in them pants.

122
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:22,024
Oh, gimme gimme gimme gimme.

123
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,425
Wait.

124
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:51,096
You say you want to wake up,
but you just sleep, in your dreams.

125
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:54,150
Can you sleep in your dreams?

126
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,437
If I was on fire, would you burn up
with me? would you burn down with me?

127
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,154
I think it's a code.
Why d'ya think that makes money, babe.

128
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,327
Sure, why not?

129
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,743
It's not just the words. It's like there's something underneath 'em.

130
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:23,265
How I hate to see you this way
I feel for you, Love

131
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:29,606
Is there nothin' I could say
to cheer you up?

132
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:37,608
For I see your face
Is filled with so much sorrow

133
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:43,367
Wish I could make it disappear

134
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:47,363
Before this night is through with us

135
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,790
Casey!

136
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:03,595
I gave you his picture.
Oh, yes you did, and I remember it
so clearly.

137
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:13,273
You from some newspaper?
No.

138
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,072
Oh.

139
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,199
Did he say "Oh" or "Well", Jimmy?
- Whatever.

140
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:30,752
You should've had an answer planned.
In code?

141
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:35,257
No, I'm serious.
But what, it's not something you could've
expected, after all.

142
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:37,377
Ouch!  Shit!

143
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:44,263
Ouch, god damn it.
What are you doing?

144
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:48,772
I want to finish up the roll,
so I can put them in now.

145
00:19:55,698 --> 00:20:00,277
It wasn't something I thought up first, you know.
I thought 'why not.' I did.

146
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,654
Just stood up and did it.

147
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:06,621
Impulse, that's what it was.
- Right.

148
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:11,794
If I'd have thought about it first, I might've
fallen on my face and broken the camera.
-Yeah, your hands were shaking.

149
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:13,667
You mean you saw?

150
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:17,834
Vi, well I couldn't think what name to call him.
Gimme that, gimme that.

151
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:11,903
Woah! easy, easy!

152
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,945
I mind this stuff in my space.
- We've gotta fuckin' rehearse.

153
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:21,490
Always talking out, where's that going to get
us?  Maybe you're into dodging golf balls -

154
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:25,492
but selling life insurance is killing me.
-If what I do is  holding you back,

155
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:28,333
maybe you should get someone else.
- I just wanna figure out a way to get
these going.

156
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:32,131
Figure out a way without selling me out.

157
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,222
Just a minute.

158
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:55,069
Get back to work.
This ain't no Photo-Mat.

159
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,986
The head goes on in five minutes.

160
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,983
Hello, I'm Evie Decker.

161
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:33,199
I know you don't know...you don't know  me, but ...

162
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:43,877
Hello, I'm Evie Decker.
I know you don't know me, but ...

163
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:47,005
Hello, I'm Evie ...

164
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,673
Well, nice that you could show up.

165
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:01,895
See you.

166
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,276
Hey Baby, let's go.

167
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:14,275
Get  your ass back there, boy.
We got a customer.

168
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:20,035
even now
even now

169
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:25,377
even now
I want no more,

170
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,924
and I want too much.

171
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:33,427
and I want too much.

172
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:43,099
If I called your name wrong,
would you still say 'yes'?
-You bet I would!

173
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:49,480
Oh, Elizabeth-Jade

174
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,954
I've got to find you curling in the shade

175
00:23:56,332 --> 00:24:00,330
Oh, Elizabeth-Jade

176
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:07,052
Take that plane from number seven
You will find yourself unleavened

177
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:10,382
I couldn't go up like those other girls.

178
00:24:10,597 --> 00:24:15,058
I'd be playing all out ahead of time and a
couple of words would come out backwards.

179
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:19,267
He wouldn't know if it was
backwards or forwards.

180
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:26,191
Open a window in my head -

181
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,648
you telling me

182
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,947
Names don't stick with me 
half as much as faces

183
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:38,872
but take that step
from nothing to one. 1, 2, 3, go now!

184
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,465
Elizabeth-Jade

185
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:49,131
You shake me up like pre-war lemonade

186
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:56,346
I've got to find myself a stopper
Before I find myself a popper

187
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,600
Elizabeth-Jade

188
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:11,405
I love the way your triangle's displayed

189
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,746
The warning on the label said:
Keep away or you'll be dead

190
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:49,484
Taste this.

191
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:53,017
I love the way your triangle's displayed

192
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,356
The warning on the label said:
Keep away or you'll be dead

193
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:12,622
Move! Get the fuck out of the way.

194
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:14,744
What happened? Oh my god, what happened?

195
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:23,545
C-A-S-E-Y.

196
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,265
Is Casey her boyfriend?
- No.

197
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:31,762
Well who then?
He's a singer.

198
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,274
A rock and roll, I suppose.
Don't move.

199
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:39,652
He has his own style.

200
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:49,156
Well, that set some kind of a record.
Don't you know any singers named Al or Ed?

201
00:27:49,374 --> 00:27:52,209
His first name is Drumstrings.

202
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,880
Well, I suppose she did the bast she could.
You know it's backwards.

203
00:27:57,091 --> 00:28:00,875
Backwards?
- You cut his name backwards.

204
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:07,344
I believe this might be the best 
thing I've ever done.

205
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,306
Something out of character, definite.
Not like me at all.

206
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,151
They'll bring you breakfast in bed,
I suppose, eggs and home fries.

207
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:30,120
I brought you some clothes.

208
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,502
You did?
- I thought you might need them.

209
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,418
Does that have to be so... so, uh, big?

210
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:44,089
It has to cover the whole forehead.
Didn't the doctor tell you?

211
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:47,843
Well, yes, but it takes getting used to.

212
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:52,605
Do you want to see it?
- No, that's alright.  I know what it says.

213
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,033
I don't understand.
Who is this Yesac kid?

214
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:06,614
You mean Casey. He is a singer.

215
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:10,201
Yes, I know, Casey. I know.

216
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:16,339
You know him?
- I mean, I know that's what his name is.

217
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:21,178
I never heard of Casey before.

218
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,220
We have to get
a good plastic surgeon.

219
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:31,432
I don't want one.
Evie.
This is one thing I'm never gonna back down on.

220
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:36,697
You know, while I was walking through that crowd,
I kept thinking of my name.

221
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:40,489
Evie Decker. Me.

222
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,620
Taking something in my own hands for once.

223
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,374
If I'd have started acting like this a long time ago,
my whole life might have been different.

224
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:52,915
Yeah, you could have whittled
off you whole head by now.

225
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:42,140
You know you're going to be famous.
A photographer's  here.

226
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:46,599
What photographer?
-They heard what you did. They
want to put you in the papers.

227
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:56,320
You hungry?
Breakfast will be here in a minute.

228
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:07,127
Let it breathe for a while.

229
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:12,381
That singer guy, he's here too.
- What singer?

230
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:15,629
Yesac. He's at the nurses'
station right now..

231
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,464
May I help you?

232
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:58,720
David Elliot. I'm Mr. Casey's
drummer and manager.
-Paul Ogle, Courier.

233
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:04,599
Wow, it's a great thing you did for us.

234
00:32:04,815 --> 00:32:08,315
I did it for myself.

235
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,529
Shades off, Casey.
I need a reaction here.

236
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,000
You the newspaper lady?
- No.

237
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:28,628
You sure do look like her.
- Don't you know how to smile?

238
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,297
Look this way, Miss.

239
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:37,931
I need some with your arm around her.
- Come on, man, you got enough.

240
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:41,227
Almost done, Drum.

241
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:45,638
Breathe, miss, breathe.

242
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:53,485
Now...Evie ... It's Evie Decker, is that right?

243
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:57,110
And your, uh, occupation?

244
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,117
I work at Kiddie Acres.

245
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,871
Really?
-Really.

246
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:09,456
And could you tell me what end you have in mind?
- End?

247
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:14,054
What was your goal, for doing that?
- Your reason.  Did you have a reason?

248
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:19,642
She did it as a personal tribute to
Drum's musical & physical chrisma.

249
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:23,389
Excellent.
Can I quote you on that?

250
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,815
Sure?

251
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:28,815
Do you mind telling us what you did it with?

252
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,569
I don't remember.

253
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:34,701
Had you planned it?
- Give her a break.

254
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,284
It's hard to say.

255
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:41,330
Well, I think I got it all.
It's only a caption anyway.

256
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:46,835
A caption?
- You know, the writing under a photo.
-He knows what a caption is.

257
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,130
This is supposed to be an article. Now we're
just gonna get a newspaper photo?

258
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:54,383
Don't talk to me, talk to my boss.
See you folks.

259
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,925
I'm gonna straighten this out.

260
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:04,608
Why'd you go and cut it backwards?

261
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:07,061
It just worked out that way.

262
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,863
Can't you read it?
- Sure I can.

263
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:15,572
I can see not, it's uneven.
The 'Y' droops.

264
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:19,205
Why'd you make it Casey?
Why not my first name?

265
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,918
What, Drumstrings?
I don't have that big a forehead.

266
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,419
'Drum.' Just 'Drum.'

267
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:29,252
They call you Drum?
- That's right.

268
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:34,179
I certainly wish I'd have known.
-Yeah, well.

269
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:42,185
It's funny, I never would've taken you for a groupie.
- I'm not.

270
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,491
You're gonna be famous someday.

271
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,252
This sorta has a peculiar feeling.

272
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:09,806
Kinda like meeting up with your own face
somewhere. You know, like in a dream.

273
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:15,391
See you.

274
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:25,524
Hello, it's Bertha. What you...

275
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:32,408
Now what I wanna know is when that
Dr. Menthe's in such a stuck-up way

276
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:36,951
Is it his way, or do he just
act like that for the play?

277
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,668
Hello.
- Who is it?

278
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:46,751
Another friend of your daddy's.
- You talk to them.

279
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:50,803
Honey, they ain't nothin' I can say to 'splain you to nobody.

280
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:53,590
She don't want to talk to you.

281
00:35:56,147 --> 00:36:00,359
Why don't you get dressed up instead
of parading your mopey self aroun' here?

282
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:05,610
Why, I'm not going anywhere.
- Well I can see that, Miss,
and it sho' do twist my heart.

283
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:24,050
Those bills.

284
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:26,467
Here.

285
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:40,649
BUNNY'S TALE: WHAT I DID FOR LOVE

286
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,758
Hello. Hello!

287
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:47,257
Here is E ... Hello!
- Hello!

288
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:51,769
Hello, I'd like to speak to Drum, please.
- Who?

289
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,388
Oh,  just a second.

290
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:58,228
Bertram!

291
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,563
Phone!

292
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,285
He's coming.

293
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:09,113
Hello.
- Hello. This is Evie Decker.

294
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:14,409
Your name is on my forehead.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

295
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:19,373
What's that?
- I'll have to tell you when I see you.

296
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:22,594
Where are you?
- I live in Fulquay.

297
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:26,470
My address is 205 Enshaw.

298
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:49,905
The beetle spray seem to be working.
- Good.

299
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:57,465
Well, you been...out much?

300
00:38:58,718 --> 00:39:02,134
Talked to anyone?
- Just Violet.

301
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:09,686
What, was there something you wanted to say?

302
00:39:10,523 --> 00:39:13,773
No, not that I can think of.

303
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,409
I didn't know you wore glasses?

304
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:22,759
I thought you'd drive me to work,
while we talk.
-I don't have much time.

305
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:26,261
Well to Kiddie Acres, I'll tell you
the fastest way.

306
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:38,692
I thought you'd have a motorcycle.

307
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:41,780
No, they're too dangerous.

308
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:45,081
What is it you wanted to tell me about?

309
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,666
How do you usually get publicity?
Do you advertise?

310
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:52,715
My manager does all that.

311
00:40:52,924 --> 00:40:57,219
Wouldn't  he like it if you got more?
-Why? Where you gettin' it?

312
00:40:57,429 --> 00:41:02,637
I thought...if I started coming to your shows, you know, at the Unicorn,

313
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:05,094
where people could see me.

314
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:10,105
I could pull the hair off my face,
and...and show your name.

315
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:14,069
People would talk.  You know this town.

316
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,942
D'you know what I mean?

317
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:24,033
Are you going to have, um...?
- Scars.

318
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:29,536
So what do you think?

319
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:45,727
I can't play under those conditions.

320
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:51,853
Talk to your manager about it.
-Look, I'm real sorry about what happened to you...

321
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:57,782
and I appreciate everything you're done,
but I have my own life to lead.

322
00:41:57,994 --> 00:42:02,242
No one said you didn't.
You can lead your own life all you want to.

323
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:11,088
Wait.

324
00:42:38,163 --> 00:42:40,369
Here we go, Evie.

325
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,539
Make sure your father takes
one of these in the morning, and now, too.

326
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:46,995
Thank you.
- Thank you, Evie.

327
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:50,669
Hey, how you doin', Evie?
- Hey, Joe.

328
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,762
I'm David Elliot.

329
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,474
Yes, I know.
- This is about Drum.

330
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:17,990
Drum is an amazing talent. I think he deserves
a bigger audience, don't you?

331
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:23,330
That's why when I heard what you suggested
I was naturally interested.

332
00:43:23,545 --> 00:43:27,128
Why, he's not?
- What does he know?

333
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,875
He knows whether he can sing or not.
- Do you want to try it?

334
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:34,677
If people notice, you can stay.
If not, you go, alright?

335
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,102
What, just try sitting there?
-That's right. Be ready tomorrow night. I'll pick you up.

336
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:45,646
I don't...I don't feel right without knowing what he said.

337
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,941
You can't listen to him. He says no to
everything, and where's that leave you?

338
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:54,985
Played in a room to himself, wasting all that
talent. I hate to see things wasted.

339
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:05,498
Which d'you like better, top or bottom?

340
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:09,635
They both look good.

341
00:44:14,891 --> 00:44:19,933
You didn't have to bring it up.
You must've gotten to him somehow.

342
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,114
Can I heal you?

343
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,703
Tomorrow is nothing.

344
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:40,490
I'll see about yesterday.

345
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,795
But don't forget your keys.

346
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:49,505
Take your tiny load ...

347
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:07,944
Who shall I say is calling?

348
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:20,160
Speak it.

349
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:34,724
But wouldn't your time be better spent

350
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:37,937
On days to come?

351
00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:40,900
Not the ones that went

352
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:46,614
And left you on a doorstep one grey morning

353
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:56,699
One grey morning
One of many

354
00:45:56,918 --> 00:46:00,085
I dream about you

355
00:46:00,296 --> 00:46:05,338
Always turning up on your doorstep

356
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:21,145
Are you okay
- It's all right. It didn't get that dirty.

357
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,519
Yeah, it's good.

358
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:30,410
Oh, I am hungry!

359
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,546
Did the lens go down?

360
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,462
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

361
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,924
Hey, I'm insured. I swallow the lens,
I only have to pay the deductible.

362
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,758
You OK?
You alright?
- Excuse me.

363
00:46:56,232 --> 00:47:00,230
Oh, look. See that, oops, see that.
You got food all over yourself.

364
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:04,650
You're a mess.
- Thank you.

365
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:07,571
Thank you. I'll take this right off.

366
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:09,577
Thank you.

367
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:29,474
Someday the right people are gonna hear your
music, and everything will change for you.

368
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:31,807
You think so, huh?

369
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,848
When you speak your loudest, it's like you're talking
straight to people. It's like you know something.

370
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,436
How you know all this?
- I know if it sounds good.

371
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:44,070
I don't know that, how do you know?

372
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:49,154
I feel a lot better about life then when I'm playing.

373
00:47:49,372 --> 00:47:53,156
It's the only time that things go right.

374
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:57,540
Am I making any sense?

375
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:05,009
God, you have the prettiest eyes.

376
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:12,971
Hey you all. Well, it's not a total loss.
Met this guy in the john,
wants to use us for a prom

377
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:17,731
A prom?
- Elvis did proms.

378
00:48:17,944 --> 00:48:22,405
There are so many things I could say

379
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:27,661
you just don't wanna hear

380
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:33,412
Lord knows I don't want to stand in the way

381
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:38,919
But I can see through what you see in the mirror

382
00:48:39,134 --> 00:48:43,179
dirty windows fogging up your mind

383
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:46,058
if it seems to you I'm failing

384
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:50,273
It seems to me I'm trying

385
00:49:12,628 --> 00:49:17,172
Ahhh Bertram, I just keep feeling something would happen

386
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:20,294
You wanna dance?

387
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:22,546
Come on.

388
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:29,395
Athens GA is the hottest place to play.

389
00:49:29,605 --> 00:49:32,772
What about Unicorn?
- What about it?

390
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:37,693
Come on, gimme some congratulations.
-Congratulations. I'm gonna get a sip of water.

391
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:41,321
You wanna dance?
No, I'm......

392
00:49:42,786 --> 00:49:46,736
Pardonnez-moi,
s'il vous plait.
[Pardon me, please.]

393
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:54,543
I just hope he doesn't get so famous
that he forgets about the little people
who did him a good turn.

394
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:59,336
He would have hired him anyway.
He's the best musician I know of.

395
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:02,175
Honey, Evie's going [inaudible].

396
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,095
As a matter of fact,
Evie's been thinking of quitting.

397
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:10,352
She feels the point's been made by now,
besides which the scars are starting to fade

398
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:15,857
Of course, she might just want to go and sit at a little table and watch.

399
00:50:16,071 --> 00:50:20,781
She doesn't.
-Well you...you can let her speak for herself, Bertram.

400
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:26,119
I don't know, I mean, if it was up to me I might want to drive along and hear you play.

401
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:30,662
See!
-You don't know what it's like playing night after
night with those letters staring back at you.

402
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:37,131
Woah, woah, wait a minute, you're getting
worked up over nothing.
If you don't want Evie there, she won't come.

403
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:40,796
Right, I won't come, not if that's the way he feels.

404
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,852
All you've got going, is on account of me

405
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:51,020
Speaking out doesn't make any sense,
and I'm not gonna be around.
We'll see how far you go.

406
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:54,818
What a bum she is.

407
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:05,662
No wonder no one understands what you're
talking about. You just hammer out noise
like any old fool in a roadhouse.

408
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,876
That's a lie. You don't mean that.

409
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:12,538
You're just pissed off because I'm not taking you to Athens.

410
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:18,210
I was working at the Unicorn
before I ever heard your name.

411
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:23,223
I didn't notice anyone asking how come
no girl had cut 'CASEY' in her forehead.

412
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:28,731
How long did you think it was gonna last?

413
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,565
It was a waste.
It was all for nothing.

414
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:49,994
That's my girl.

415
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:57,007
I always knew you'd come out of this
if I just let you be.

416
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,489
Is everybody doin' all right?

417
00:52:15,158 --> 00:52:19,108
Let's give it up for Mr. Drumstrings Casey!

418
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:29,455
I'll keep your monkey

419
00:52:29,673 --> 00:52:32,924
I'll treat him good

420
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:39,511
I'll talk to him
Like he talks to you

421
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:50,148
I'll try forgetting

422
00:52:50,362 --> 00:52:53,566
So I won't forget

423
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:58,575
And maybe someday, someday, someday

424
00:52:58,788 --> 00:53:03,996
maybe you'll come back to me

425
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,873
And maybe someday, someday, maybe

426
00:53:09,091 --> 00:53:12,875
maybe someday you'll come back...home.

427
00:53:18,142 --> 00:53:23,184
Are they greys?
When were they pink?

428
00:53:23,398 --> 00:53:26,897
Look at the letters cut backwards.

429
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,318
You know how I do it, breaking the silence.

430
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:38,365
If I tell you again, will you listen this time?
-NO!

431
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:49,629
I don't want what I have got.
- You don't know what we want either.

432
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:55,589
I do not want what I have got.
- Yeah, yeah, fucking neither do I,
alright, come on, let's go.

433
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:59,058
That's just your pain and all, expressed like that.

434
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:26,541
Your coffee. Hey.

435
00:54:28,551 --> 00:54:30,923
I talked to Craig.

436
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:34,304
Rest of the gig he just wants our songs, no talking out.

437
00:54:34,516 --> 00:54:38,383
Fuck him. I play what I play.

438
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:42,732
It's his club. We were hired to open.
- We were hired to play.

439
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:46,726
We were hired to open.
Check this out.

440
00:54:48,114 --> 00:54:50,819
This is good.

441
00:54:52,243 --> 00:54:59,207
“The Cat’s Cave, the hub of the Athens club scene, prides
itself on mixing the old & the new, crisscrossing rebel-rousing
rock & roll with cutting-edge musical discoveries.

442
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:04,578
It's a hit-&-miss proposition, and Drum Casey,
the opener, definitely falls into the 'miss' category.

443
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,586
"This unorthodox ..."

444
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:11,005
Just play the fucking songs tonight!

445
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:18,218
Fucking baby. You better give Teed-Off
a call, let 'em know you're coming back!

446
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,913
Evie, you're wanted out here.
-What?

447
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,332
You'll want to come out here.

448
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:13,954
I thought you were in Athens.

449
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:21,964
I guess I should have called or something.
- Damn straight.

450
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:31,598
It's so hot.

451
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:35,225
I got fired.
- What?

452
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:41,397
Evie, there's a drink here
for Elvis if he wants it.

453
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:47,985
Is this your mother?

454
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:52,318
You have the same eyes.

455
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:55,706
She died when I was born.

456
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:13,096
Tell me what happened?

457
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:40,289
You think I could sleep on your couch?

458
00:57:47,181 --> 00:57:50,432
No. I don't think so.

459
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:25,300
Have you been to David's?
- Not yet.

460
00:58:26,098 --> 00:58:31,603
How about your parents? Have you been home?
- What for? Why the hell would I go there?

461
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:39,278
Why was it me you came to?

462
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:47,244
You and me really had some fight that night.
- I asked you a question.

463
00:58:47,454 --> 00:58:53,291
I heard you.
-Have you ever answered one, had a real conversation,
one that goes back & forth like it's supposed to?

464
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:03,796
Don't you ever smile?
- Of course I do.

465
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:07,679
You weigh on my head,
but you bring me luck, too.

466
00:59:07,893 --> 00:59:10,811
What do you mean?

467
00:59:11,021 --> 00:59:14,936
If I'd taken you to Athens like you asked,

468
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,235
it might have worked out differently.

469
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:24,901
I see you cut yourself some bangs.
- I thought it was time to.

470
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:30,495
Does that mean you were serious?
- Serious about what?

471
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:34,043
What you said about my music.

472
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:37,959
That's my father.

473
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:40,377
When'll I see you.

474
00:59:43,515 --> 00:59:47,762
I was just angry.
I can listen all day when you play.

475
00:59:51,732 --> 00:59:57,071
It should have said: "I don't like you anymore."
I don't like your music, I don't even
remember what it sounds like

476
00:59:57,279 --> 00:59:59,949
"And I don't want you sleeping on the porch."

477
01:00:00,157 --> 01:00:04,369
Maybe he should have leaned over and planted a big wide kiss on those speaking-out lips.

478
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:13,744
Guess who.

479
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:19,379
I heard about Athens.

480
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:26,136
I've blown some big ones myself.

481
01:00:27,353 --> 01:00:32,644
Sorry I'm late, I was with a client.
JJ, can I get a beer &
a shot of Bushmill's, please...

482
01:00:32,859 --> 01:00:35,315
and whatever Drum's having there?

483
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:40,446
No, I'm sorry, bring Faye-Jean
a glass of water, no ice.

484
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:45,452
Honey, do you mind? Working on kind of a tight schedule.
That's all right, big man.

485
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:48,701
Naturally.
So, stranger...

486
01:00:51,004 --> 01:00:54,539
Whatcha  been doing?
- Not much.

487
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:57,758
Eh?

488
01:01:00,264 --> 01:01:02,837
Fuck off.

489
01:01:06,228 --> 01:01:08,767
He'll pass.

490
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,520
Come on, man, lighten up. We'll give it another shot.
Unless we go on.......

491
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,653
We start in the evening
half past eleven surfaces.

492
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,133
I wish you would go.

493
01:01:42,351 --> 01:01:44,178
I mean it.

494
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:48,724
As soon as I get used to you being gone,
you turn up again.

495
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:52,357
Why don't you just get out and stay out?

496
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:07,959
Evie.
- What?

497
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:16,173
What?

498
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:21,598
I was thinking about how you are

499
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,475
How am I?

500
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:30,476
Different.

501
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:44,286
Say something.
- About what?

502
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:48,665
I don't care, anything.
- I can't think of things just like that.

503
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,252
I like to hear you talk.

504
01:03:01,686 --> 01:03:04,521
Your face is so soft.

505
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:11,731
That was the first thing I noticed about you

506
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:18,317
I didn't know skin could feel this soft.

507
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:24,534
I work at the library now. I quit Kiddie Acres.

508
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:29,686
Hey Babe.

509
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,419
I looked for you.
You disappeared.

510
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,934
I saw in this magazine once about this place in Ashville.

511
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:03,773
The computer picks out a haircut
to go with the shape of your face.

512
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,775
What?

513
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:13,903
What  business is it of yours how I look?

514
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,204
I want to marry you.

515
01:05:19,084 --> 01:05:22,001
What? Don't you want to?

516
01:05:30,471 --> 01:05:33,140
No, I don't.

517
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:40,688
Evie, I can't stop thinking about you.
- Why, what do you like about me?

518
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:45,067
No, I mean it. Name one thing.

519
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:51,649
I like how you listen to me.
-What else?

520
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:58,374
I like how I feel with you.
-You don't even know me.

521
01:05:59,419 --> 01:06:03,499
You make me feel like I can be myself.

522
01:06:05,467 --> 01:06:09,050
I want to get married.

523
01:06:09,262 --> 01:06:12,798
I want us to have a home, someplace safe.

524
01:06:13,851 --> 01:06:17,018
Change.

525
01:06:17,229 --> 01:06:20,480
Make a change.

526
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:25,985
Don't you want to change your life around some?

527
01:06:27,157 --> 01:06:30,407
How can you ask me that?

528
01:06:38,419 --> 01:06:42,251
Do you need someone to care about you?

529
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,151
here comes Evie and she walks down the aisle

530
01:07:03,362 --> 01:07:07,657
there is Drum man
he's wearing a bigger smile

531
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:11,533
Vi, I do think this is the
most exciting day of my life.

532
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:18,210
Don't mess with that.
- I didn't and don't you touch that.

533
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:21,706
Now, all we need is something blue.

534
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:27,886
What do you think you're doing?
- I was standing by traditional.
Something old. new, borrowed, blue.

535
01:07:28,097 --> 01:07:33,009
This whole thing is against my better judgement.
Just want you all to know that.
-Yeah, we know.

536
01:07:33,228 --> 01:07:39,432
He thinks we shouldn't be getting married?
-Gee, about the first time I've seen you 2 on speaking
terms & here we are driving to your wedding.

537
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:42,937
You're wrong, it's not the first time.

538
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:47,199
I don't see anyone asking for your advice.

539
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:59,457
I'm driving my own hearse wagon.

540
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:04,501
Inside a month you'll be a full-time
gas station attendant. We can kiss
what's left of our career goodby.

541
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,263
Hey, don't look at me that way, Evie.
I'm saying this for your own good, too.

542
01:08:09,475 --> 01:08:14,980
Where's your tact? Here we are, we're
about to get my best girlfriend married
& you're talking about hearse wagons?

543
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:20,101
You know what? Pull over & let him out. We'll walk the rest of the way.
- Be my guest, if you wanna walk.

544
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:28,661
Hey, things are getting out of hand here.
- Oh, nice time to back out.

545
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,243
Shut up. Let's go.

546
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:37,578
Wait, we are not walking anywhere.
I plan to have a normal, ordinary wedding
at which there is no fighting.

547
01:08:37,797 --> 01:08:43,136
We're going to do this one thing the way it
ought to be done, and afterwards we can
celebrate with a bottle of champagne.

548
01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:46,595
Now is that too much to ask?
- Nope.

549
01:08:47,432 --> 01:08:49,805
Sounds good to me.

550
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:20,884
Casey Decker.

551
01:09:23,221 --> 01:09:26,471
This is what I wanted.

552
01:10:00,302 --> 01:10:03,090
I guess I'll change.

553
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,750
[inaudible]

554
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:28,347
Hey, I can see why they wrapped the glasses but what is this paper band on the toilet supposed to do?

555
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:32,562
Do you know what I mean?
What happens when you break the seal?

556
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:38,483
Is it like when you're not supposedto take the
tag off your pillow? You know those guys on
the raft in the Tidy Bowl commercial?

557
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,156
Evie.
- What?

558
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:44,454
Take off your jacket.

559
01:11:57,512 --> 01:12:01,973
I've always wondered how people get
to this part of taking off their clothes.

560
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:06,808
Come here.

561
01:12:23,498 --> 01:12:26,784
I like this song.

562
01:12:27,753 --> 01:12:30,873
You're so little.
- What do you mean?

563
01:12:35,261 --> 01:12:39,306
You're so pretty.
- You don't have to say that.

564
01:12:43,436 --> 01:12:47,386
Why do you think I married you?

565
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:05,371
You lie down next to me?

566
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,136
Evie Elizabeth.
- What?

567
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:33,944
Casey.

568
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,947
It's your name now too.

569
01:13:46,462 --> 01:13:51,927
Would you like to make love with me?
-Yes.

570
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,344
I'm a virgin.

571
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,273
Drum.
- What, Baby?

572
01:15:11,137 --> 01:15:14,422
Come here.
- I can't, I got to go.
-It won't take long.

573
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,262
No, I can't, I can't be late for work....again.

574
01:15:17,477 --> 01:15:22,186
Then I'll just have to kill more buggles.
- Aren't you supposed to be playing with the guys at Broom's?
-I'd rather stay here & play with you.

575
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:25,234
No, I mean it, I mean it, aren't you
supposed to be practicing?

576
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:28,611
Jesus, will you lighten up?

577
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,875
My, my, the happy couple.

578
01:15:43,088 --> 01:15:47,584
Can't you ever knock?
- Don't talk to me about knocking.
I'm missing my stories.

579
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:53,592
I expect I'll be teaching you how to use it.

580
01:15:53,807 --> 01:15:57,640
Did you get my biscuit recipe yet?
- Look it up in the cookbook.

581
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:01,472
You know a cookbook won't do.
Drum has a special recipe in mind.

582
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:03,814
I'm sure.

583
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:07,610
His kind uses bacon drippings.
Nothing special to that.

584
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:12,236
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you liked Drum?

585
01:16:12,452 --> 01:16:16,035
I'll tell you why. Go see your daddy.
You broke his heart.

586
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:27,088
Kills me to see somebody so shook up.
Just wanders around like a ghost.

587
01:16:28,929 --> 01:16:33,425
When you gonna visit him?
- If I invite him to dinner, will you help out?

588
01:16:33,642 --> 01:16:37,972
I expect you'll be wanting my
tuna casserole recipe now, too.

589
01:16:41,984 --> 01:16:45,188
That...that looks delicious, Evie.

590
01:16:46,322 --> 01:16:50,320
What it is?
- Tuna supreme.

591
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:55,874
Uh, just a smidge. I'm allergic to artificial coloring.

592
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:59,369
Except in your hair.

593
01:16:59,586 --> 01:17:02,256
Give me a lot, Evie.

594
01:17:02,465 --> 01:17:06,593
It's a little cold in here, isn't it?
- Crying out loud, Mom, it's November.

595
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:11,422
I have to teach you how to make biscuits.

596
01:17:12,684 --> 01:17:16,302
Drum is very particular about biscuits.

597
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,522
I love you.

598
01:17:21,068 --> 01:17:23,393
Do you bowl, Mr. Decker?

599
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:28,358
Well, I have bowled, but...never regularly.

600
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:33,660
You mean you have irregular 'bowl' movements?

601
01:17:33,873 --> 01:17:39,663
Dear god, will you spare us?
- I'll spare us, I'll spare us all right.

602
01:17:40,797 --> 01:17:45,127
I was so glad you all could come,
because we never had a real reception.

603
01:17:45,344 --> 01:17:52,177
Uh, Evie, Drum. I'd like to give you two
young people a belated wedding present.

604
01:17:52,393 --> 01:17:56,012
I'm buying a new car anyway.

605
01:17:56,815 --> 01:18:00,148
Would the old VW be of any help?

606
01:18:02,696 --> 01:18:07,239
Thank you so much daddy. That would be great
-Yeah, that's really great.

607
01:18:08,536 --> 01:18:11,027
I'm glad to hear it.

608
01:18:11,247 --> 01:18:15,197
What do you need a car for?
You're not going anywhere.

609
01:18:15,418 --> 01:18:18,918
Lord knows, we don't have any
extra cars to hand out.

610
01:18:20,465 --> 01:18:23,917
I do have a little housewarming gift.

611
01:18:34,897 --> 01:18:40,140
I know this one was always your favorite.
- Oh my gosh, we used to dance to Les Brown.

612
01:18:40,361 --> 01:18:43,944
And I used to sing with him. That's me.
I'm right there.

613
01:18:44,157 --> 01:18:47,324
What did you have to drag that out for?

614
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:53,706
This is a....it's a lovely party.

615
01:19:09,518 --> 01:19:12,435
Evie, would you care to dance?

616
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:39,840
Out of the way.

617
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,793
Luther.
- Sit down, you.

618
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:46,089
Get your hands off her.

619
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:50,143
Don't you mess....[inaudible]

620
01:19:50,282 --> 01:19:53,241
Why'd you have to go and plan this for?
I was just trying to patch things up.

621
01:19:53,357 --> 01:19:57,900
Quit trying to plan my life out, will you!
- It's our life, Drum.
-Don't remind me.

622
01:20:03,492 --> 01:20:07,158
Uh, I...I just...use the powder room.

623
01:20:08,623 --> 01:20:11,197
It's in through the bedroom.

624
01:20:11,418 --> 01:20:14,372
Put paper down.

625
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:17,589
Where's the TV?
- We don't have one.

626
01:20:17,799 --> 01:20:21,584
All right, get going in there, then.
We're leaving.

627
01:20:26,726 --> 01:20:31,851
You know it'd been a hell of a lot more sacrifice
if she'd been prettier to begin with.

628
01:20:43,827 --> 01:20:46,864
I'll just clear these away.

629
01:20:47,081 --> 01:20:50,082
There's jello.

630
01:20:57,425 --> 01:21:00,343
That's OK. Sit down, Daddy.

631
01:21:03,599 --> 01:21:09,435
You and Drum could come to supper some day.
Would you do that?

632
01:21:10,857 --> 01:21:13,145
Thanks.

633
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:21,617
Thank you for the dance.

634
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:08,708
Come talk to me, Baby.

635
01:22:10,629 --> 01:22:13,666
What are you doing out there?

636
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:25,760
Come here.

637
01:22:40,661 --> 01:22:44,362
I shouldn't have talked
to you like that.

638
01:22:48,503 --> 01:22:51,754
I don't know what's gone wrong.

639
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:56,716
I was thinking like...maybe my own life is ruined.

640
01:22:56,929 --> 01:22:59,598
And whose life is it?

641
01:23:03,102 --> 01:23:06,020
Is this some kind of slipping-down menace?

642
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:11,059
You need to get your music out
to people who appreciate it.

643
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:17,486
How you going to get out, then, if nobody knows your name?
-Well that's my business, isn't it?
-It's my business, too.

644
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:23,156
It's me you're talking to.
- You're not listening, you're thinking
about publicity, which makes me tired.

645
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,586
I'm tired, too, of getting nagged at all the time.

646
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:31,046
And having to face that
nagging forehead of yours.

647
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:37,462
I don't know why don't you wear bangs anymore?
- I don't wear bangs because I don't
back down on things I've done.

648
01:23:37,681 --> 01:23:41,809
And I've never said a nagging word to you in my life.
- All right.
- Have I?

649
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:52,479
Forget it. I was just talkin'.

650
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,361
Take your coat off.

651
01:23:56,576 --> 01:24:00,242
Come on, take off your coat.

652
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:22,602
Where's my luck gone?

653
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:38,701
It feels like I've hit my peak & passed it.

654
01:24:40,499 --> 01:24:44,283
Like I'm just waiting to grow old.

655
01:24:51,677 --> 01:24:55,378
Are you still awake?
- No.

656
01:24:55,598 --> 01:25:00,225
Don't fall asleep before me.
- I won't. I'll tell you the second I do.

657
01:25:00,437 --> 01:25:03,391
You know I didn't lie alone in the dark.

658
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:06,643
But you're not alone. I'm here too, Drum.

659
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:57,036
It's for him, David. I know he won't like it,
but I  can't stand watching him
curl up around the edges.

660
01:25:58,082 --> 01:26:01,249
It'll never fly.
- I'll arrange the whole thing.

661
01:26:01,461 --> 01:26:04,830
You can't arrange Drum.

662
01:26:11,221 --> 01:26:14,507
Hi, Drum.
- Hey, hey, what's going on?

663
01:26:14,725 --> 01:26:17,050
Would you like a cracker?

664
01:26:19,855 --> 01:26:23,189
I got him. I got him.
- What's going on?

665
01:26:23,401 --> 01:26:26,367
And it's a kidnapping, and we're going on the radio station.

666
01:26:27,155 --> 01:26:31,105
Evie, call 'em off.
- It'll be good publicity, Drum.

667
01:26:31,326 --> 01:26:35,573
You're not going to call the police on a bunch
of crazy fan types. I'm gonna bring you back.
Think of it as a field trip.

668
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:38,363
Watch the door, watch the door.

669
01:26:58,772 --> 01:27:02,984
Evie, it's me, Mr. Harrison.
- I was just on the way out. Drum has been kidnapped.

670
01:27:03,194 --> 01:27:07,061
Not for real.  A bunch of fans got him.
-Well Drum can wait. Your father is sick.

671
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:11,445
And I want to take you with me.
- No... but Drum's been kidnapped.
-Well we don't have time for that.

672
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:16,703
Your father has had another heart attack, Evie.
He's dying.

673
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:19,915
He's dying.

674
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:22,835
He's in this....?
- In there.

675
01:27:25,968 --> 01:27:29,135
How is he?
- Aw Evie, Dear.

676
01:27:29,347 --> 01:27:31,719
He passed, Dear.

677
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,175
Oh, I know he's not. This is Evie Decker.

678
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:50,307
I need you to have him get a
message to Drum.

679
01:28:50,517 --> 01:28:53,222
He's at the beauty parlor on Gleneve.

680
01:28:53,437 --> 01:28:57,601
Have him tell Drum,
that my father died.

681
01:28:57,817 --> 01:29:01,268
Have him...have him come to
my father's house.

682
01:30:37,174 --> 01:30:39,665
BUNNY'S TALE: WHAT I DID FOR LOVE

683
01:31:12,295 --> 01:31:15,498
What the fuck are you doing out here?

684
01:31:16,507 --> 01:31:19,877
Get in, you sorry piece of shit.

685
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:49,834
Lord, I still can't take it in.

686
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:57,292
Where's your bangs, may I ask?
- I pin them back now.

687
01:32:13,944 --> 01:32:17,195
I need to go to the bathroom.

688
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:34,337
You don't look good.
How far along are you?

689
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:37,420
What?
- One month, two?

690
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:42,303
Three almost.
- And you never told your daddy.

691
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,394
What is it makes you act like that?

692
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:50,856
Drink your cocoa, good for the baby.

693
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:55,901
...in "Rolling Stone" at the library, a lot of ...

694
01:32:57,825 --> 01:33:02,119
Drum, this is for you so you can
hear how good your songs are.

695
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:08,000
I read about it in "Rolling Stone" at the library.
A lot of musicians use the words you're writing.

696
01:33:08,211 --> 01:33:11,165
I know you won't want to hear this.

697
01:33:11,381 --> 01:33:13,872
Where the fuck is she?

698
01:33:14,092 --> 01:33:16,714
She's in there?

699
01:33:18,722 --> 01:33:21,213
What'd you get there?

700
01:33:21,433 --> 01:33:24,221
I'm sorry, it looks like I'm late for the party.

701
01:33:24,437 --> 01:33:26,180
Get lost.

702
01:33:26,397 --> 01:33:30,525
You separated, too, ain't you?
- I am not.

703
01:33:30,735 --> 01:33:34,947
Well where's he at in your pile of trouble ?
- He'll be here. It's complicated.

704
01:33:35,157 --> 01:33:39,237
No point in a husband if you ain't
got him to lean on during stress?

705
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:56,344
If I'd have thought, I'd have brought my mother.

706
01:33:56,554 --> 01:34:02,344
She's the consoler at the Baptist Church.
She console the mourners 'till they get cheered up.

707
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:05,310
How's she do that?

708
01:34:05,522 --> 01:34:09,521
Oh, she just hug 'em, pat 'em on the shoulder, offer 'em kleenex

709
01:34:09,735 --> 01:34:12,227
How else would she do it?

710
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:16,819
It all comes down to sex

711
01:34:19,913 --> 01:34:24,125
Up or down, up or down, and then...

712
01:34:25,461 --> 01:34:28,711
It all comes down to sex

713
01:34:30,049 --> 01:34:33,465
All comes down, all comes down to sex.

714
01:34:33,678 --> 01:34:38,139
I'm afraid you won't want to hear it...
that's the way I feel whenever I try
to tell you...

715
01:34:38,349 --> 01:34:41,304
I was trying to find the right time ...

716
01:34:41,519 --> 01:34:43,927
Shut up!

717
01:34:46,108 --> 01:34:48,813
But there never seems to be one.

718
01:34:49,028 --> 01:34:53,405
I believe I'm having a baby in about six months.

719
01:34:54,408 --> 01:34:59,699
Anyway, merry Christmas, Drum. Can  you believe that next Christmas
we'll have our own family.

720
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:36,067
Nice of you to show up.

721
01:35:46,673 --> 01:35:49,544
Think you can just stay away all night ...

722
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,093
and pop back in here like nothing happened?

723
01:36:11,783 --> 01:36:13,740
Cool it.

724
01:36:21,919 --> 01:36:25,917
Excuse me for being here,
but you were away, after all.

725
01:36:26,799 --> 01:36:28,792
Zip me up, would you?

726
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:36,223
How do I get out of here?

727
01:36:36,435 --> 01:36:40,219
Think my car's gonna even start?
- Walk to the highway and catch a bus.

728
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:45,018
In these shoes?
Can you just give me a ride?
- I don't have the time.

729
01:36:55,705 --> 01:36:59,205
I've been home. My father died.

730
01:37:13,349 --> 01:37:16,304
Evie, I'm sorry about your father.

731
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:23,147
Nothing happened with her.

732
01:37:33,705 --> 01:37:36,160
Can you say something.
What are you thinking about?

733
01:37:36,374 --> 01:37:41,036
We've gotta get organized.
You ever look at this place?
It's a pig pen.

734
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:45,047
And it's freezing in here.
- So you want to talk about housekeeping?

735
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:48,213
Not housekeeping, just everything.

736
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:52,593
Look at yourself, Drum. You gotta pull yourself together.
- You're the one that had me kidnapped last night.

737
01:37:55,728 --> 01:38:01,067
I can't live up to this dream of yours.
It's like you're pushing me to lift something
I don't have the muscles for.

738
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:06,022
I'm not talking about your career, Drum.
I'm talking about you.
- So what is it you don't like?

739
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,525
You don't write anymore, you don't play, you've just given up. You don't even try anymore.

740
01:38:09,743 --> 01:38:15,118
You want me to be more like you?
Crawl through the bathroom window
even when the front door's open?

741
01:38:17,335 --> 01:38:20,170
You're right, Evie.
You're always right.

742
01:38:21,297 --> 01:38:25,046
You want to change things?
You want me to change?

743
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:28,131
Getting married sure didn't do it, did it?

744
01:38:28,347 --> 01:38:32,179
I don't know why I thought anything would be different?

745
01:38:32,393 --> 01:38:35,844
You're right, you can just think you're so fucking good.

746
01:38:36,063 --> 01:38:39,479
Is this it?
Is this what you want?

747
01:38:39,692 --> 01:38:44,236
I want to pack up and leave. We could start over.
We can move into my father's house today.

748
01:38:44,447 --> 01:38:47,235
You mean live there, in his house?
- It's our house now.

749
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:50,867
This is our fucking house!
- It doesn't feel like it.

750
01:38:51,079 --> 01:38:55,540
Shit, Evie. I can't just trail after you like that.
- Alright.

751
01:38:55,751 --> 01:39:00,081
My globe broke. Oh, then I'll go away.

752
01:39:05,011 --> 01:39:09,056
If we move into that house,
we'll be stuck in this town forever.
We'll die here.

753
01:39:10,475 --> 01:39:14,805
If you don't come, then, it's you leaving me.
The choice is yours.

754
01:39:21,362 --> 01:39:26,155
What about this? How will you support our
baby all alone?

755
01:39:27,035 --> 01:39:30,071
And how do you explain to strangers
having 'CASEY' written across your face?

756
01:39:30,288 --> 01:39:34,238
I'll tell 'em it's my name.
It is my name.

757
01:39:35,377 --> 01:39:38,829
Evie, don't go.
[recording]There's something I've gotta tell you.
I'm afraid you won't want to hear it.

758
01:39:39,965 --> 01:39:42,005
Come with me, then.
[recording]that's the way I feel
whenever I try to tell you

759
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:49,052
I keep looking for the right time
or the right way,
but there never seems to be one.

760
01:39:50,769 --> 01:39:55,063
I believe I'm having a baby in about six months.

761
01:39:57,693 --> 01:40:03,150
Anyway, merry Christmas, Drum. Can  you believe that next Christmas
we'll have our own family.

762
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:08,488
In my mind, I see him clearly.
He looks just like you.

763
01:40:43,867 --> 01:40:46,275
Do you like it?

764
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:37,209
You're on the air with Dick Dondair.
Tonight I'm broadcasting to you live
from the Fox Theater in Atlanta.

765
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:41,174
So, when might we be seeing you
back at the Unicorn?

766
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:46,595
Well, I don't know, but right now,
me & the guys are headed over
to Nashville to make a record.

767
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:53,560
Well that sounds good to me. I never did know
what you were all about, but the crowd
out there tonight sure seemed to like it.

768
01:41:53,776 --> 01:41:55,982
You think you're invisible, but I see you.

769
01:41:56,195 --> 01:42:01,782
Is that more of that speaking out that you do?
- No, that's me talking.

770
01:42:02,827 --> 01:42:07,205
Now this one goes out to Evie, from Drum.
He loves her very much.

771
01:42:07,415 --> 01:42:10,333
I believe him, Evie.
I think you should, too.

772
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:27,769
if I had a voice

773
01:42:29,147 --> 01:42:31,982
it would sound like yours

774
01:42:33,986 --> 01:42:37,355
if my eyes could see

775
01:42:38,324 --> 01:42:42,820
they would see much more than I believe

776
01:42:45,665 --> 01:42:48,286
learn to speak

777
01:42:49,419 --> 01:42:51,910
learn to see

778
01:42:53,757 --> 01:42:57,375
forget what I always knew

779
01:42:58,429 --> 01:43:01,928
start again

780
01:43:05,853 --> 01:43:09,139
as I watch you

781
01:43:10,024 --> 01:43:12,729
I am moving, too

782
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:18,356
as you travel through

783
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:23,869
I am walking to a move by you

784
01:43:26,584 --> 01:43:30,202
to leave this place

785
01:43:30,421 --> 01:43:34,834
where I can't turn

786
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:38,421
I can't even breathe

787
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:43,014
start again

788
01:43:46,647 --> 01:43:50,266
if I had your heart

789
01:43:51,277 --> 01:43:53,982
I would dare like you

790
01:43:55,824 --> 01:43:59,952
I can't seem to start

791
01:44:00,162 --> 01:44:04,740
to love the world like that, I want it, too.

792
01:44:07,211 --> 01:44:10,129
i can learn to trust

793
01:44:11,007 --> 01:44:13,676
just enough

794
01:44:15,595 --> 01:44:19,130
to push past all the ends

795
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,386
to start again
