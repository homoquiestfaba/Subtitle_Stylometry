  Is that what happened here,

887
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,826
       new kid whose face
     I can't see or trust?

888
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,431
       (Crispo)
       We like doing good things
       for our school

889
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,266
                   that we love.

890
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,101
                       Things.

891
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,203
         What is that?
       What is it saying?

892
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,106
What he means is

893
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,408
the confidence
and strength you project

894
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,111
inspires us all to
do great things.

895
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,846
Thank you.

896
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,749
Well,
you're welcome.

897
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,552
I am here to inspire.

898
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,353
             And might I suggest
             early dismissal.

899
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,789
             We've had a lot
             of excitement today

900
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,524
          and I think you'll win
          even more students

901
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,760
           with your compassion.

902
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,695
                  (whispering)
                  Do it before
                  somebody dies.

903
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,165
I am compassionate too.

904
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:14,037
     Hader, Hader, Hader...

905
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,441
         (all chanting)
      Hader, Hader, Hader,

906
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:22,011
     Hader, Hader, Hader...

907
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,148
Oh, early
dismissal, everyone!

908
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,550
     (school bell ringing)
         (all cheering)

909
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,152
                Principal Hader!

910
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,354
              I saw them,
              the three of them!

911
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,189
                  All in--
    Shut it, Paul.

912
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm being cheered.

913
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,462
           (cheering)

914
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,734
            (Hader)
            Up high.

915
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,872
       Principal Changer
         in the house!

916
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:53,843
     Well, thanks for that,
    uh, one last adventure.

917
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,215
   I guess it's back to your
 studies and back to your book.

918
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,653
        See you around.

919
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,421
Seriously,
you're leaving?

920
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,893
            (Crispo)
   'Cause if we're gonna stay
        friends forever,

921
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,196
        we're gonna need
a lot more one-last adventures.

922
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,299
                  Well, this is
                  middle school,

923
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,769
           the time to live life
           and try new things.

924
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,804
How many things?

925
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,706
                  I can think of
                  a hundred.

926
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,608
            (Crispo)
              Ooh!

927
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,877
           Then we're
       gonna need these.
       (animal growling)

928
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,682
        So looking back,

929
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,686
do I recommend freeing a raccoon
  on your first day of school?

930
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,154
             Yeah!

931
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,357
Because I learned that no matter
      how bad things get,

932
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,160
       we have the power
     to make things better.

933
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:48,231
 I learned that with friends by
your side, you can do anything.

934
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,068
 And I learned that slow-motion
  makes everything look cool.

935
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,269
               ♪♪

936
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,140
     But if you don't have
  a raccoon in your homeroom,

937
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,976
  try just getting out of your
         comfort zone.

938
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,844
         Sure, it might
      get a little crazy,

939
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,080
   but isn't that the point?

940
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,884
And the biggest thing I learned
     from my singing dream

941
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,321
       is that these are
the greatest years of our lives,

942
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,324
       so let's make sure
         we break out.

943
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,192
        All you need is
       a little courage,

944
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,961
   a couple of good friends--

945
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,930
      oh, and don't forget
        the sunglasses.

946
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,901
     One down and 99 to go.
