1
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,335
Try to drink this,
sweetheart.

2
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,312
He's not gonna make it
to tomorrow.

3
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:23,057
But you know,
he's not going to be alone.

4
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,849
Doesn't that give you
any kind of comfort?

5
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:34,103
I've spent so much time
with you and your father..

6
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:36,664
When we were waiting for
your mother to pass..

7
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,294
Don't you think she's there
waiting for him right now?

8
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:47,084
Why don't you go in there,
talk to him?

9
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:48,989
He's awake.

10
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,214
He'll be up
for a little while.

11
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:54,414
Go talk to your daddy.

12
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:47,831
Hey, you think you could get me
out of here?

13
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,539
Where to?

14
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,929
I could go for a cold beer
right about now.

15
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,309
Is that game on?

16
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,822
Yeah.

17
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,524
We're playing Boston.

18
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,816
Yeah?
-We're losing.

19
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,150
Alright, hold still.

20
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:15,037
Where's your guy?

21
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,895
Come on,
stop it.

22
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,145
What's his name?

23
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:20,109
There is no guy.

24
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,188
After we lost
your mom..

25
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,500
It occured to me..

26
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,392
Just how great that stuff was.

27
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:33,433
I don't want you alone
out there, Sophia.

28
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:35,164
I know.

29
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:39,349
I want you to be struck
by lightning..

30
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,758
Floored by someone
you just can't live without.

31
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:46,000
Like i was.

32
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,087
You make it sound
so easy.

33
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,807
I know.

34
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,292
But if you pay attention..

35
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:58,973
Something that profound
could actually happen.

36
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,001
Something that profound, huh?

37
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,475
I'm serious.

38
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,872
I've come to a realization that..

39
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,283
This life may actually
be all we really have.

40
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,414
I spent my entire life
trying to live up..

41
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:17,950
To something..

42
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,029
For the church.

43
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:21,542
But..

44
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,134
Now i'm finding..

45
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,712
I'm more alone than i ever was.

46
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:30,076
I know you've been
here for me.

47
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,813
But..

48
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,400
Everything i ever believed in..

49
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,088
Was tested after
your mom died.

50
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,032
And the more i
cried out..

51
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:41,265
The lonelier i got.
-Sshh..

52
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:44,531
I don't feel it anymore, Sophia.

53
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:49,497
I think it's never really there.
-Hey, come on.

54
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:53,249
I need you to consider the possibility
that i was wrong about it.

55
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:55,411
I was wrong about everything
i taught you.

56
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,422
Dad, come on.
-Sorry.

57
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,698
I'm so sorry, Sophia.
-Dad..

58
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:02,125
Dad, come on.
Relax.

59
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:03,778
Sshh..
Don't do this.

60
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:06,656
There's nothing here.
-Daddy.

61
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,644
Many of you watch me
grow up here..

62
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,433
In this place that my father started
more than 20 years ago.

63
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:39,672
And as you know,
he devoted his life to a God he believed..

64
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:41,732
Was worthy of it.

65
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:44,541
That he believed
was real.

66
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,136
And as you know, he gave
his heart and soul..

67
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,384
To a God that..

68
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,725
Eventually took his
beloved wife..

69
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,976
My mother, from us,
6 months ago.

70
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:59,750
After a year long battle
with cancer.

71
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,782
He gave his heart and soul
to a God..

72
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,094
That mere months
after she passed..

73
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:09,566
Allowed him to be stricken
with an illness so severe..

74
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:13,134
That he begged and pleaded
with this God to take him.

75
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,200
Night after night.

76
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:18,711
Just so he could have
a moment of peace.

77
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:23,003
I'm not here to talk about..

78
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,043
Where my father is going or..

79
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:29,879
A God that will received him
at the holy gates of heaven..

80
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,496
I'm here to talk about a man
who was an embodiment..

81
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,523
Of an entire set of
believes for us.

82
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,978
For me.

83
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,941
Because..

84
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:48,639
I've realized that that set of believes,
as solid as it may have felt..

85
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,770
It was based entirely
on his.

86
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,904
Without him, i have never seen
a shred..

87
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:58,188
Of evidence to validate..

88
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:01,536
What i had naively
accepted as facts.

89
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,414
As my father lay
on his death bed..

90
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:09,441
His last words
confirmed something for me.

91
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,754
He said he was wrong.

92
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:18,336
He was wrong about
all of it.

93
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,688
And after days of
soul searching..

94
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:25,140
I believe he was right.

95
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,665
There are no ghosts or demons or loved ones
waiting for us on the other side..

96
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,654
There is nothing.

97
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:36,913
There is nothing.

98
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:42,424
Those children stories
we grew up believing..

99
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:45,128
A grown man
living in a whale..

100
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,254
A talking bush..

101
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,841
They're just that,
they're children stories.

102
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,808
I'm sorry to say this here..

103
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,370
And now.

104
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,055
But this earth..

105
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,941
Is all we will
ever know.

106
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:11,412
And i defy god of any kind
to prove me otherwise.

107
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,699
Everyone i have ever loved
is gone.

108
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:24,540
And the idea of a life
after this, it's a myth.

109
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,050
It's a sham.

110
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,745
And if there is a God
and you can hear me..

111
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:36,486
Then fucking prove it.

112
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,305
Are you for real
right now?

113
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,323
Seriously, Sophia.

114
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:57,048
I love your work
as much as anybody else, but..

115
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:59,507
Don't you think it's time
for some new stuff.

116
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:03,170
Aha. So you were thinking
about it.

117
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,859
No.

118
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,935
By the way, they're almost here.
-Who?

119
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:10,387
This little Penny
and her brother.

120
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,533
They're new in town.
-Here for what?

121
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,984
We're taking them out tonight.

122
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,401
No, Sam.
-I'm telling you.

123
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,848
This is just what you need.
It'll snap you right out your funk.

124
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,055
I haven't even showered yet.

125
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,774
Don't worry,
you smell like roses.

126
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,951
Oh, and bring the camera.

127
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,054
You probably see something
that'll kickstart you a little bit.

128
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:32,715
James is dying to meet you.

129
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:34,691
He likes brunettes.
-Who?

130
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,501
The brother. I told him how fun
and charming you used to be.

131
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,456
Come on.

132
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,261
I'm busy, Sam.
-No, you're not.

133
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,139
You're hiding, Sophia.

134
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:46,953
Come on.

135
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,832
Sam..
I beg you.

136
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,583
Hey guys.
-Hey.
-How are you doing?

137
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,879
Great.

138
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,817
James, slight change of plans.

139
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,998
Sophia's got a migrain, so it's just gonna be the three of us.
-Okay.

140
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:06,429
But they are beautiful,
thank you mate.

141
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,677
Well, physically everything is normal.

142
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:37,526
Same as it was
a couple of weeks ago.

143
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:42,664
Sophia, you're going to live
a long and healthy life.

144
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,629
Good. Good cause i've..

145
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:50,780
I don't know, i feel like things
haven't been right lately.

146
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,318
Grieving is a journey.

147
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,455
Takes time.

148
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,028
I know it does.

149
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,785
But i feel..

150
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,919
I feel like..

151
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,411
Like what?

152
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:09,667
Come on.

153
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,763
I've known you since
you were in braces.

154
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:16,490
I can't even explain it.
I just feel like..

155
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,886
It's the way people
look at me.

156
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:23,363
Is it similar to how you feel
when you're in high places?

157
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:27,294
Because i know you've been
noticing your fear of heights a bit more.

158
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,461
Yeah, i think that'll
always be there.

159
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:33,571
Well, that's true. But i think
the fear of height..

160
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,060
Has something to do with
a lack of control.

161
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,493
What about your
personal life?

162
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:44,294
You getting out there
a little bit?

163
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,739
It's a little slow.

164
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,471
Sophia, i see girls your age
coming here all the time..

165
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,105
And they all have this..

166
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:57,278
Spark of hope
in their eyes.

167
00:15:57,398 --> 00:16:00,296
They've got the whole world
laid down in front of them.

168
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,004
That's in there,
somewhere.

169
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,053
Do you feel alone?

170
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,061
I am alone.

171
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,262
But that's okay,
that's just how it is.

172
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:16,832
Doesn't have to be.

173
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:20,090
I think maybe it does
right now.

174
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,065
Why?

175
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:24,120
Because how can i possibly
lose someone else?

176
00:16:24,162 --> 00:16:26,551
You know?
It's like..

177
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:31,074
I'm not physically built
to endure it.

178
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:35,937
You know? I give up another piece of me
and i lose it..

179
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,301
So this is it,
and i'm okay with that.

180
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,452
Are you?

181
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:43,572
Yes.

182
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,759
Oh my God!

183
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,461
I am so sorry.
Are you alright?

184
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:17,131
Are you okay?
-Yeah.

185
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,491
Are you sure?
-Yeah, i'm okay.

186
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:21,265
Is there like a bruise or a cut or something?

187
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,283
No, it's okay.

188
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:25,209
Here, let me help you up.

189
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:26,965
I'm so sorry.

190
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,078
I.. I run sometimes.

191
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:34,542
To get there quicker.
I scared the crap out of you, didn't i?

192
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,153
No.

193
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:40,596
Yeah, you scared me half to death.

194
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,020
Yeah, i..

195
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,640
Don't know how i could miss you.
I'm Adam Hunts, by the way.

196
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,213
Sophia Monet.

197
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,360
Like the painter?
-Yeah, exactly like him.

198
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:54,966
Do you paint?

199
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,201
No, i'm a photographer.

200
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:01,583
Well, Miss Monet, i totally get being startled in the dark.
It happens.

201
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:05,348
It might have been the creeper running
through the darkness that did it.
-Yeah.

202
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:07,161
Yeah, it might have.

203
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,399
What's wrong?

204
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:13,089
Oh no, nothing.

205
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:16,214
Are you sure?
It doesn't look like nothing.

206
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,565
Yeah, it's okay.
I just.

207
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,012
I keep seeing these
blank of spots.

208
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:23,574
Are you serious?

209
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,063
Here, wait just look at me.
Look at my eyes.

210
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,847
How's your balance?

211
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,805
Are you messing with me?

212
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:36,886
Come on.
-You deserved it.

213
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:39,516
I was about to call an ambulance.
-Come on.

214
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:42,528
You were about to faint.
-You look a lot meaner than you look.

215
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:45,455
You shouldn't tackle helpless woman
on the street.

216
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:46,996
I guess not.

217
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:50,135
It was valiant of you though.
Try to cure my blindness.

218
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:55,762
Can i walk you and make sure you get where you're going?

219
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:58,333
I mean, i did save your eyesight.

220
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:03,516
Kind of a hero..
If you want to get technical about it.

221
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:06,750
OKay.

222
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,398
But i need you to
maintain a 3 foot perimeter.

223
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:11,367
Okay. That's fair.
-Okay.

224
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,793
I can do that.

225
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,853
Safety zone right here.

226
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,942
Wow, you really coming out of the corner.
-I hurt you, didn't i?

227
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:19,785
I run fast.

228
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,495
So, this is my building up here.

229
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:32,102
Wow.
-Yes, very impressive.

230
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:34,981
That would be the little tour group
that's always there.

231
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:38,684
For what?
-It's one of the city's oldest building. It's like..

232
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,905
A spooky haunted thing.

233
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:42,815
That's comforting.

234
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,939
I guess it's kind of big
with the paranormal crowd.

235
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,444
You think they tell you something like that,
before you moved in.

236
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,265
I wouldn't.

237
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:53,212
Well, not that i..

238
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,942
Buy into that stuff.

239
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:58,130
You're creeped out by it, but you don't believe in it.
How exactly does that work?

240
00:19:59,452 --> 00:20:01,442
Well, i think..

241
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:05,131
You grow up with an idea and
it kind of becomes engrained in you.

242
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:08,416
I bet if you go on
this tour with me..

243
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,209
You wouldn't be freaked out.

244
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,432
Look at you. You're freaked out.
Come on.

245
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:16,967
It's gonna be fun. We can make fun on how
ridiculous the whole thing is.

246
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,485
Maybe another time.

247
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,869
The thing is, i might like you a little bit.

248
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:26,650
And if we are gonna go out,
just for me..

249
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,095
I think i need to know
a little bit more about you.

250
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,434
Like maybe you could tell me..

251
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:33,403
Something else you're afraid of.

252
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:37,420
I never said we were going out.
-I think you did, didn't you?

253
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,850
Maybe it was me.

254
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,875
Come on, humor me.
Tell me something.

255
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,442
You first.

256
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,419
Okay.

257
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:51,102
I'm afraid of missing the boat.

258
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:54,045
If i see something
right in front of me and..

259
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,490
My gut says go after it,
then..

260
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,379
I go.

261
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:00,291
Gets me in trouble sometimes.

262
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:03,375
And that's why you're a hero.
-See, you get me already.

263
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:04,776
Your turn.

264
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:10,620
I'm afraid of heights.

265
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:13,520
Like deathly afraid.

266
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:15,052
It's weird.

267
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:17,778
Everybody's afraid.
That's not weird.

268
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:20,729
Mine borders on extreme..

269
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,153
I've always been a bit of
an over achiever.

270
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,848
My car's just up here, but..

271
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:32,199
Thanks for the walk.

272
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:35,366
And, for restoring my vision.

273
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,840
You're gonna let me
do this by myself?

274
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,452
I gotta sleep up there.

275
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:42,559
Hey, i'm sure you'll be fine,
big boy.

276
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,160
Well, maybe i'll get
to run into you again..

277
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,495
I'll walk..
Don't want to injure you.

278
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:51,776
I know you think
i'm crazy.

279
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,612
But it is possible,
you know.

280
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:56,631
I mean something that profound
could actually happen.

281
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:11,746
There is a certain mystique to the halls
of the Weldon Tower.

282
00:22:13,338 --> 00:22:16,925
This hall is registered with estates
that are official haunted landmarks.

283
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:20,692
With the history of more paranormal sightings
than any other on record.

284
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:23,130
Follow me.

285
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,291
You're alright there, tiger?
-Yeah.

286
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,822
Dating back to the turn of the 20th century..

287
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,631
This was all a state run of hospital
where hundreds of people died.

288
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:35,327
It would appear for about 25 years.

289
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:38,549
Then, in the 40's they shut it down
for about a decade..

290
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:41,096
Before converted the rooms
to apartment units.

291
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:45,313
Many tenants have reported seeing
apparition over the years.

292
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,849
Figures, shoveling above the halls.

293
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,147
I'm definitely not coming up,
by the way.

294
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:54,258
There are several cases where patients reported their personal belongings missing..

295
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:57,374
Of the course of a few days,
and soon after..

296
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,833
The patients themselves
would go missing.

297
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:02,054
You better hang on
to your purse.

298
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:06,225
Now, couple of wardens found a chest full of the patients' missing belongings.

299
00:23:06,274 --> 00:23:07,997
Stashed in various places, but..

300
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,204
No trace of the patients.

301
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,666
And back in 1972..

302
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:17,786
A renovation crew worker reported
several of his belongings missing..

303
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:20,341
And soon he too went missing.

304
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:23,235
Into my knowledge..

305
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,316
He hasn't been found.

306
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:43,648
Check this out.

307
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:46,937
Shouldn't we get back?
-No, come on. are you kidding?

308
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,536
Hey, we can get in trouble.

309
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,293
This place is old.

310
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:56,899
Yeah, like you.

311
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:00,255
Oh wow.

312
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:04,371
Creepy kitchen.

313
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:07,461
Yeah.
-Smells like bacon.

314
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:10,396
Hey, real quick thing.
Smile.

315
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,991
That's.. I wasn't ready.
-I nailed it.

316
00:24:14,047 --> 00:24:15,735
Alright.
-It's good.

317
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:18,862
Horrible, hang on i have a camera.

318
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,427
Alright, here we go.
-You look like an alien.

319
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,483
Wow, you are a professional.

320
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,707
Oh..
-I'm not ready.

321
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:33,555
Oh no. Wow.
-Not sexy.

322
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,217
Yeah..
-Alright one more, one more try.
-That's amazing.

323
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,723
-This is the one.
-Ready?
-Yeah, this is the one.

324
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,796
I'll just..

325
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,297
That was..

326
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:01,571
We thought we lost you guys.

327
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:07,198
Sorry.

328
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:00,320
See you guys later.

329
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,056
Wow.
You guys are really serious.

330
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:08,233
Yeah, my dad signed me up
when i was younger.

331
00:27:08,268 --> 00:27:10,685
I used to hate doing this.
-No, you're good.

332
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:13,102
Well, i love it now.

333
00:27:13,956 --> 00:27:16,927
Can i show you something?
Can you get out of here?

334
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,524
Can i shower first?

335
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:21,758
No, i don't want you
to miss it.

336
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,792
What are we waiting for?
-You'll see.

337
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:38,888
Nice tights, by the way.

338
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,398
Come here.

339
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,009
Isn't this kind of
a bad idea?

340
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,194
You do this a lot?

341
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:56,432
It's a great idea.

342
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:02,370
You know i'm deathly afraid of heights, right?
-I know.

343
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:05,782
Okay, no no..

344
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:07,581
No, no..

345
00:28:07,623 --> 00:28:11,096
I think this is a bad idea.

346
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:15,468
You'll like it.
-No, i'm terrified about this.

347
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,418
Stop it.
Oh my God.

348
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,506
No!
-I promise you, it's gonna be worth it.

349
00:28:19,562 --> 00:28:21,965
Please.. What are we looking for?
-Come here.

350
00:28:21,987 --> 00:28:23,472
Come on.

351
00:28:30,364 --> 00:28:31,513
Wow.

352
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,931
Hey.
-Yo.

353
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,109
You read?

354
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:31,486
Yes, Sophia.
I read.

355
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,403
Oh wow.

356
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:41,573
He is handsome.
-Stop.

357
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:45,385
No, i love how i spend my nights
searching for the perfect partner..

358
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,935
And you get run over by them
on the street.

359
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:51,495
What's going on
with this one?

360
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:56,140
Must be the flash.

361
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,135
So, when are you and this sprinter
seeing each other again?

362
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:03,918
He called me a couple of days ago,
i didn't call him back.

363
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:06,191
What do you mean?
You're not into it?

364
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:08,622
I just want to keep it simple.

365
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:12,869
Seems like maybe that's not an option
with him.

366
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,685
Oh, because he isn't capable..

367
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,221
Or you aren't?

368
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:19,224
You..

369
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:23,348
Wow..
So you're that girl now.

370
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:26,916
Good for you,
if you're lucky this way..

371
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:29,823
He can disappear
and you can be alone some more.

372
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:31,238
Funny.

373
00:30:31,336 --> 00:30:33,067
You're an ass,
you know that?

374
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,758
No, i'm serious.

375
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:37,163
Happiness is not allowed
in here.

376
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,440
You know that?
-I'm not listening.

377
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:16,002
Hey, i just want to throw this out there
one last time.

378
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:19,493
I know you're a little jumpy
and i get it but..

379
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,247
I don't know,
i thought we had fun.

380
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,896
I did anyway, so..

381
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:27,159
I was actually thinking to skydiving this weekend..

382
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,834
I know you're into that sort of thing,
so i figured maybe you'd want to..

383
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,020
Jump out of an airplane
with me.

384
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:35,150
Anyway, just give me a favor
and shoot me a quick text.

385
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,434
So i at least know you're okay.

386
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:40,868
If you're not into hanging out again,
it's all good.

387
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,851
You know?
I get it.

388
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:16,896
Hello?

389
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:20,300
Hey!

390
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:23,339
Don't tell me i scared you.

391
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,496
You're messing with me right now,
seriously?

392
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:28,005
No, i'm on my way home.

393
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:30,332
I'm stuffing at Penny's tonight so..

394
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:33,940
If you and prince charming want the place,
it's all yours.

395
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:36,635
I never called him back.

396
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:40,630
2 weeks?
And you never called him back?

397
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:43,789
Oh my word, you are turning
to the ice queen.

398
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,415
I'm awful, aren't i?

399
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:51,018
Yes.

400
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:53,877
Yes you are.
-Yeah, alright.

401
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,087
Good talk.
-Good talk.

402
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:39,452
Hello?

403
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:42,506
Hey.
-Sophia?

404
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,027
Yeah.

405
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:48,137
Hi, i'm sorry i called so late.

406
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,805
Are you alright?
-Yeah.

407
00:34:51,057 --> 00:34:53,236
Yeah, i don't even know
why i called.

408
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:56,149
Tell me what's going on.

409
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:59,997
I'm just really freaked out
and i needed to talk to someone.

410
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:01,615
Okay.

411
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:03,892
Are you..
What happened?

412
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:08,456
I woke up in the middle of the night
and i couldn't breathe.

413
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:10,812
I don't know if it's just
a really vivid dream..

414
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,551
Or..
-You want me to come over?

415
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,908
No, you don't have to do that.

416
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:19,060
Well..
-I don't even know if i want to be here right now.

417
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:22,330
Come over here,
i'll pick you up.

418
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,432
To your place?
-Yeah.

419
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:28,288
Okay.

420
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:32,031
Okay, but you don't have to drive.
I can drive.

421
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,412
Are you sure?
-Yeah.

422
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:36,745
What's your apartment number?

423
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,395
2112.

424
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:41,268
On the 21st floor?
-Yeah.

425
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:43,774
I'll keep you away from the windows,
i promise.

426
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,079
Okay.

427
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,591
I'll see you soon.
-Okay, bye.

428
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:17,312
Excuse me, are there stairs?

429
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,057
The stairs have been closed
since the 70s, mam.

430
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,160
Don't tell the fire marshall.

431
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,336
No seriously, is the elevator the only
way up?

432
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,253
Take the fire escape outside
if you want to, sweetheart.

433
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,812
But i'm pretty sure that thing
hasn't been used since the 20s.

434
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,037
Hey.

435
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,013
Hey.
-Come on in.

436
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,427
I'm sorry i didn't call,
i have been thinking about you.

437
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:18,469
It's fine. Sit down,
i got something for you.

438
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,537
It's just something my mom used to make for me,
when i was a kid.

439
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,639
Hot chocolate?
-Oh yeah.

440
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:32,374
You are such a little boy.

441
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:34,006
I know,
i can't help it.

442
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,111
Do you have marshmallows?
-Of course i do.

443
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:46,839
Feeling better?
-Yeah, thanks.

444
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,612
That wasn't convincing.

445
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:51,778
Try some of that.

446
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:02,181
Tell me about this dream,
you couldn't breathe?

447
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,838
It's gonna weird you out.

448
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:06,435
If it can.

449
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:07,745
Okay.

450
00:38:08,942 --> 00:38:12,108
Both my parents died within
6 months of each other.

451
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:14,104
Recently.

452
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,436
My God, that's terrible.

453
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:19,015
I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.

454
00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:22,880
I just sort of came to
the realization that..

455
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,863
There's nothing really
out there, you know?

456
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,792
You die and that's it.

457
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:32,143
I actually started challenging anything
to prove me wrong..

458
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,781
And now i don't know, i feel like i keep noticing all these weird little things, like..

459
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:39,570
Especially after that tour we took.

460
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:42,641
And now this.

461
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:46,396
Do you think you open yourself up to something or..
-How?

462
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:49,994
I don't know, by challenging it?

463
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,067
Whatever you did.

464
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,520
I'd have to actually believe in it,
and i just don't..

465
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:58,542
It's like Santa Clause.

466
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,381
You grow up your whole life believing he's real
and then you find out he's not..

467
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:06,125
It would take Santa himself hitting you
over the head to prove you're wrong.

468
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,301
That makes sense.

469
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:10,648
It's violent but..

470
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,389
These are ridiculous.
-I know.

471
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:23,547
Look, i want you to know
it's not that i..

472
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:25,903
Didn't like you..
I..

473
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:28,348
Just don't have a phone?

474
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:30,568
You have a phone, it's fine.

475
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:32,537
Don't worry about it.

476
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,466
Sorry, i just really wanted to get that out
of my system.

477
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:50,203
Apologies accepted.

478
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,422
You should probably take it
with a grain of salt though, cause..

479
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:55,356
You did hit me on the head.

480
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:58,194
Well, i like to brain damaged my women,
good way to go.

481
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,269
And then you apply them with marshmallows?
-It's working.

482
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:03,731
It is, you monster.
-Come on.

483
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,477
That's not even near my mouth.
Whatsoever.

484
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:08,433
You're not aiming for my mouth.
-No.

485
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:10,535
You're the fine girl..

486
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,784
Can i tell you something?
This marshmallow..

487
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:15,323
Is magical.

488
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:17,404
Oh yeah.
-Yeah.

489
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,324
Oh.

490
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,523
Oh, Adam has a girl over.

491
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:10,269
Yeah, i'm sorry.

492
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:15,299
Are you..
-No, not at all.

493
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:17,772
He's just my roomie.
I'm Astrid.

494
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:19,848
Hi, I'm Sophia.

495
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:22,104
My roomate's a guy too.

496
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:24,064
So much better than chicks, right?

497
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,767
I can't stand chicks.

498
00:42:25,823 --> 00:42:29,431
Plus it's kinda nice having a sexy man around the house.

499
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,211
You like him?

500
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,240
That's cute.

501
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:37,582
Well, you have his attention and
he's a hard man to please, so..

502
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:40,616
Well, i'll let you.

503
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:41,828
Yeah.

504
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:22,067
You knew?

505
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:24,876
You knew about this?

506
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:28,727
Sophia baby, i..

507
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,996
Where did you find that letter?

508
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:33,845
Did he pay you?

509
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:35,632
Listen to me.

510
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:38,695
Your father gave up
when we lost your mother.

511
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:42,331
Honey, he didn't want you
to turn out like him.

512
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,373
He didn't pay me,
he begged me to help him end it.

513
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:50,001
And he didn't want you
to find out.

514
00:43:51,248 --> 00:43:54,760
He didn't want to hurt you.
-He didn't want to hurt me?

515
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,282
So he chose to die.

516
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:59,651
He couldn't go on, Sophia.

517
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,788
And the cancer?

518
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,741
Was all of this just so
i wouldn't know?

519
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:10,712
Your father thought that
it would be easier.

520
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:13,367
If you believed that he died
naturally.

521
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,415
Baby, i'm so sorry.

522
00:44:17,662 --> 00:44:20,002
So everything he ever said..

523
00:44:20,486 --> 00:44:21,733
I know.

524
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,155
I know.

525
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:25,758
Just read it, you can see.

526
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:27,859
I begged him not to
go through with it.

527
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:30,921
You agreed to help him.
-I didn't want to, baby.

528
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:34,589
He would've gone and done this
anyway.

529
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,820
At least this way, i felt that you would be protected.

530
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,470
You know that is an eternal death sentence
in his book.

531
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,409
This is just such a lie.

532
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,358
What are you gonna do, Sophia?

533
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:54,542
I'm gonna go to his funeral.

534
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:57,001
And i'm gonna speak
like i said i would.

535
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:51,080
Is someone here?

536
00:47:06,982 --> 00:47:08,257
hello?

537
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:18,936
Hey.
-Hey.

538
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:27,142
Let me see it.
-Come on, this doesn't have to be a big deal.

539
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:28,901
Come on, let me see it.

540
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,709
Alright, it's not as bad as it looks.

541
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:35,589
Yeah well, you said there's a piece of glass in it, so..

542
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:38,599
Yeah, this one.

543
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,364
Ouch.
-Sorry.

544
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:43,758
It's okay.

545
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:47,172
Where was Sam?

546
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:49,281
He was sleeping.

547
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:52,539
It doesn't have to be
a big thing.

548
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:55,537
This might burn.

549
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:58,263
That's never what a girl
wants to hear.

550
00:48:58,614 --> 00:48:59,952
Astrid..

551
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,253
Ignore her.

552
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:09,784
Is that alright?
-It's okay.

553
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:12,978
How this happened again?

554
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:19,185
I broke some glass, so maybe i touched a piece with my finger and..

555
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:21,693
I don't know, scratch my chest.
-Yeah.

556
00:49:21,813 --> 00:49:23,647
How did you break the glass?

557
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:26,691
A picture fell while i was
in the other room.

558
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:29,452
How did it fall?
By itself?

559
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:32,168
Maybe i set it down too close to the edge.

560
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,248
It just fell?

561
00:49:37,223 --> 00:49:38,372
Hey..

562
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:41,962
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

563
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:43,377
Yeah?

564
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:46,342
I think you should stay here tonight.

565
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:52,043
I'll sleep on the couch.

566
00:49:58,833 --> 00:49:59,898
Okay.

567
00:51:28,424 --> 00:51:29,315
Wait.

568
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:33,500
What?

569
00:51:35,531 --> 00:51:37,940
What happens if i fall in love with you?

570
00:51:42,524 --> 00:51:43,830
Everything.

571
00:53:35,825 --> 00:53:36,739
Adam?

572
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:47,703
Adam?

573
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:05,993
Adam?

574
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,241
Adam?

575
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:13,231
What's going on?

576
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:15,575
I can't find him,
and there's blood..

577
00:54:24,183 --> 00:54:25,689
Is that his blood?

578
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:28,320
Where is he?
-I don't know.

579
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:32,048
Oh my God.

580
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:34,333
Do you have your phone?
Call the police.

581
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:37,404
I'm gonna call him first.

582
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:39,415
You never know,
mabye he's..

583
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,705
Call the police, Astrid.

584
00:54:54,554 --> 00:54:55,579
Shit.

585
00:54:56,691 --> 00:54:58,592
Fucking hold!

586
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:01,959
What are you doing?

587
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:03,775
Sophia?

588
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:13,915
Sophia..

589
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:15,792
Stop, seriously.

590
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:17,212
Can you get through?

591
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:45,980
Oh my God.

592
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:49,893
Wait, are you still on hold?

593
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,942
Yes.

594
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:52,989
We should go back and wait.

595
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:55,927
What are you doing?

596
00:56:02,517 --> 00:56:04,082
Yes hi, hello.

597
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:06,472
I live in the Walden Tower,
16th and Harper..

598
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:10,134
Apartment 2112, my roomate has gone missing
and there's blood on his bed.

599
00:56:10,525 --> 00:56:13,278
No, we found him gone.

600
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,907
His girlfriend was in bed with him,
she's here with me now.

601
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:23,443
No, there's blood everywhere.

602
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,756
We think he was taken
to the top floor.

603
00:56:25,828 --> 00:56:27,285
Hello?

604
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,698
Hello?

605
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,075
Okay, we should..

606
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:32,868
We should stop and wait.

607
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,075
No.

608
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:36,344
We can't just go up there, Sophia.

609
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:37,902
Why not?

610
00:56:38,022 --> 00:56:40,089
Someone came into our apartment
and took him.

611
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:42,090
We don't know that.

612
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,071
We should go back.

613
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:29,550
Oh my God.

614
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:33,703
No, no Sophia,
someone else is in there.

615
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,603
We have to go please,
we have to go.

616
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:37,803
Come on, come on.

617
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:50,063
And the last time you saw him
was around 11 pm, correct?

618
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:51,285
Yes.

619
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:53,114
We went to sleep together.

620
00:57:53,153 --> 00:57:56,385
Okay, after you realized he was missing,
how long before you called 911?

621
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:57,915
I called, actually.

622
00:57:57,987 --> 00:58:00,775
I heard Sophia yelling for Adam,
that woke me up.

623
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,092
I called a few minutes
after that.

624
00:58:02,137 --> 00:58:03,628
And how much blood
did you see?

625
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:05,673
There was some on the sheets and..

626
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,150
Kind of a trail
leading to the door.

627
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:10,155
You should look
upstairs too.

628
00:58:10,188 --> 00:58:12,144
We are, we got men up there now.

629
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:13,804
And did you see the blood as well?

630
00:58:14,196 --> 00:58:16,584
Yes.
-And how much blood did you see?

631
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:19,492
The same amount that she did.

632
00:58:19,923 --> 00:58:21,717
Did you guys even
look in there?

633
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:23,923
Yeah, i've looked.

634
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,576
We've looked all over.

635
00:58:25,696 --> 00:58:26,789
Okay.

636
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:28,677
We scouted the entire apartment.

637
00:58:28,733 --> 00:58:30,863
We checked all of it,
there's no blood anywhere.

638
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,188
What do you mean?
Of course there is.

639
00:58:33,973 --> 00:58:36,465
There was blood all over here,
and on the..

640
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,663
On the door.

641
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:48,337
There was blood here.

642
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:50,265
Excuse me, Officer Sowman.

643
00:58:50,696 --> 00:58:51,722
Can i have a word?

644
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:54,004
Give me a sec, ladies.

645
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:58,452
Did we leave the door unlocked
when we went up?

646
00:59:00,212 --> 00:59:01,704
I don't know.

647
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:11,233
Well, we did a thorough check
of the elevator and all of this area..

648
00:59:11,272 --> 00:59:12,992
It's completely vacant.

649
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:15,632
Nothing suspicious,
no signs of force entry.

650
00:59:16,288 --> 00:59:17,972
Do you ladies..

651
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:19,603
Drink any alcohol tonight?

652
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:21,346
You can't be serious.

653
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,535
On any kind of medication
or anything?

654
00:59:23,591 --> 00:59:24,886
No.

655
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:26,371
Okay.

656
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:28,325
These things often happen.

657
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:30,376
Someone gets up
in the middle of the night..

658
00:59:30,432 --> 00:59:31,753
Doesn't tell anybody.

659
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:33,866
They usually turns out to be nothing in the end.
-No.

660
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:36,260
He was bleeding, officer.

661
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,351
How long have you known him?
-Long enough.

662
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:41,477
You're not listening,
we both saw his blood.

663
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,461
You can't tell us that
we didn't see it.

664
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,253
I understand that.
-Then do something!

665
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:48,607
I've got zero evidence
and nothing to go on.

666
00:59:48,727 --> 00:59:51,031
You can't be fucking serious.

667
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,973
Listen, why don't you just
get some rest, okay?

668
00:59:54,093 --> 00:59:55,629
I'm sure he'll be fine.

669
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:58,622
If he doesn't come up in the morning,
come and file a report.

670
00:59:59,491 --> 01:00:00,948
Wait, that's it?

671
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,569
Until he's gone 24 hours,
nothing else i can do.

672
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:06,242
This thing has a way of
working themselves out.

673
01:00:06,596 --> 01:00:07,896
I'm sure he'll be okay.

674
01:00:07,935 --> 01:00:09,740
Ready?
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

675
01:00:18,394 --> 01:00:20,349
I don't want anything
to do with this.

676
01:00:20,952 --> 01:00:22,836
Besides i don't have
any keys.

677
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:24,588
So i can't help you.

678
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,267
But isn't that part of your job?

679
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:30,505
It's not.

680
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:33,601
We're really worried about him.

681
01:00:33,987 --> 01:00:36,213
Anything you could tell us
will help.

682
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,511
I can tell you not to go up there.

683
01:00:39,422 --> 01:00:41,031
Call the police.

684
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:42,727
I'm not a detective.

685
01:00:42,783 --> 01:00:45,999
We did call the police, 
they don't want to come until tomorrow.

686
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,337
How long have you lived here?
-A year.

687
01:00:48,393 --> 01:00:49,829
A year?

688
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,735
And you haven't heard about
what goes on up there?

689
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:54,620
What's up there?

690
01:00:54,907 --> 01:00:57,514
It's infested.
-With what?

691
01:00:57,808 --> 01:00:59,728
People came to die here.

692
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,074
For over a half century.

693
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:04,592
What do you think?

694
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,960
I went up there once.

695
01:01:07,016 --> 01:01:09,519
When i first got here,
about 30 years ago.

696
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:11,193
And?

697
01:01:11,313 --> 01:01:13,057
I'm not going up again.

698
01:01:14,732 --> 01:01:16,385
Look, Mr Carter..

699
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:19,226
All these ghosts stories aside..

700
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:22,701
Don't you think that maybe there's just a couple of vagrants up there?

701
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:27,209
I can't imagine anything last more than
5 minutes up there.

702
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,375
Top floor is where they all
came to die.

703
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:45,089
This woman, supposedly was in charged up there,
lived up there for years.

704
01:01:45,672 --> 01:01:49,238
They said she used to steal patient's.

705
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:52,067
Put their all belonging in a box.

706
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:54,323
And do God knows what
with them.

707
01:01:56,243 --> 01:01:58,492
said she was..

708
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,257
Trying to help them.

709
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:02,740
Pass on.

710
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:06,824
Ladies.

711
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:09,951
This building has an
ugly history.

712
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,447
Just..

713
01:02:13,657 --> 01:02:15,261
Wait for the police.

714
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:33,007
How do you do this?

715
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:38,090
It takes a little patience.

716
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:44,998
Why did you stop?

717
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:48,985
I don't know.

718
01:02:50,176 --> 01:02:51,446
Yeah you do.

719
01:02:55,827 --> 01:02:59,197
I think maybe i lost sight of
the beauty around me.

720
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,131
I just didn't feel it anymore.

721
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:11,329
It keeps coming back
to the water.

722
01:03:18,046 --> 01:03:23,041
My dad used to say that the ocean is the closest we'll ever get on this earth to God.

723
01:03:30,828 --> 01:03:33,666
I think maybe it's just the shared magnitude of..

724
01:03:38,883 --> 01:03:42,397
I used to go there after my mom died
and tried to capture it.

725
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,365
Maybe i could..

726
01:03:44,986 --> 01:03:48,383
Experience something she was experiencing.

727
01:03:51,922 --> 01:03:54,255
I want to take you to the ocean.

728
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,001
Who are you again?

729
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:05,707
I'm Adam.

730
01:04:08,187 --> 01:04:09,952
You can call me Biff.

731
01:04:10,478 --> 01:04:11,905
All the ladies call me Biff.

732
01:04:15,107 --> 01:04:16,760
You better not let go.

733
01:04:18,362 --> 01:04:19,763
I won't.

734
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:22,594
Promise?

735
01:04:34,177 --> 01:04:35,746
I promise.

736
01:04:44,953 --> 01:04:47,062
Your friends supposed to be here
an hour ago.

737
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:52,837
Mr Carter's crazy.

738
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:54,799
You got that too, right?

739
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:04,241
You're late.
-Nice to meet you too.

740
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,817
I thought you were bringing
another guy.

741
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:10,689
Hi, I'm Penny.

742
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:15,100
Hey.
-I'm sure it'll be fine, there are 4 of us.

743
01:05:15,163 --> 01:05:16,816
It's gonna be alright.

744
01:05:16,863 --> 01:05:20,057
Sam told me about what happened.
I think it's awful.

745
01:05:20,365 --> 01:05:22,815
But i can help you guys look.
-Thanks.

746
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,218
Sophia, who's to say..

747
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,166
This guy didn't just skip town.

748
01:05:27,222 --> 01:05:29,758
Maybe he wants you to believe
something happened to him.

749
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,622
That's not what happened, Sam.

750
01:05:31,742 --> 01:05:33,522
I'm just saying.

751
01:05:33,564 --> 01:05:37,858
Why don't the 4 of us go grab some drinks,
see how this thing pans out..

752
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,567
He's gonna come running back
in a few days.

753
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,566
Look, if we just go up there
and look around, we'll find him.

754
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:45,097
Okay?
I promise.

755
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,100
Are you sure we need
all this stuff?

756
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,761
Yes.
-Alright then.

757
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:28,286
Is that normal?

758
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:30,604
It's not usually that bad.

759
01:06:39,522 --> 01:06:41,252
What is happening?

760
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,836
I don't know.

761
01:06:52,352 --> 01:06:53,606
Okay.

762
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:05,817
What the hell was that?

763
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:09,572
I don't know, it's a really
old building.

764
01:07:36,278 --> 01:07:37,735
Hello?

765
01:07:39,466 --> 01:07:41,462
Anybody here?

766
01:07:53,863 --> 01:07:55,629
Should we even be here?

767
01:07:55,749 --> 01:07:58,961
You guys said the police investigate
this entire floor right?

768
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,329
So, we'll be fine.

769
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:10,197
alright, let's go down here.

770
01:08:12,663 --> 01:08:16,886
Penny, wait here. Tell me if you see anything.
I'm gonna check this room out.

771
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:20,630
Great, thanks.

772
01:09:17,843 --> 01:09:19,013
Sam?

773
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:24,206
sam, i'm gonna go, okay?

774
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:28,808
Sam?

775
01:09:32,184 --> 01:09:33,417
Are you okay?

776
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:36,675
No, i don't want to be here anymore.
Okay?

777
01:09:36,934 --> 01:09:40,501
You said we'd be doing something fun tonight.
And we are not doing something fun right now.

778
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:43,675
We're fine, relax.
There's nobody up here.

779
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,198
Sophia's freaking out. We need to stick around
to make sure she's okay, alright?

780
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:50,979
I'll make it up to you, 10 more minutes.
Listen..

781
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:52,534
You're not gonna believe this.

782
01:09:52,576 --> 01:09:55,449
Some classic originals are in this room.`

783
01:10:05,947 --> 01:10:07,445
Look at this.

784
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:26,120
What the hell is that?

785
01:11:17,905 --> 01:11:19,699
It's just a record player.

786
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:27,450
I think we should look somewhere else.
We didn't find anything here.

787
01:11:59,841 --> 01:12:01,481
We need to go down.

788
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:04,549
Yeah, i'm with Sam on this.
-Let's just look somewhere else.
-No.

789
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:07,184
We need to go down.
-Wait, just wait a second.

790
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:11,681
We haven't even seen anything yet.
-Sophia, we shouldn't be up here, this shit is not normal.

791
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:13,979
Come on,
we're leaving.

792
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:20,248
Sophia.

793
01:12:22,924 --> 01:12:24,256
Okay.

794
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,087
Wait.

795
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:30,509
Wait.

796
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:31,945
Listen.

797
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:34,044
That sounds like Adam.

798
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:38,079
That's him,
he's up here.

799
01:12:48,818 --> 01:12:50,570
Where's it coming from?
Here?

800
01:12:54,605 --> 01:12:56,337
What is this place?

801
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,722
Come on.

802
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:28,418
You see that?

803
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:29,413
No.

804
01:13:30,821 --> 01:13:33,147
Something's there.
-Is that him?

805
01:13:35,173 --> 01:13:36,511
Wait.

806
01:13:54,739 --> 01:13:57,423
What do you see?

807
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:02,263
Penny!

808
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,365
Penny!

809
01:14:04,421 --> 01:14:05,785
Stop!

810
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:22,335
Penny!

811
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:25,529
Sam, where are you?

812
01:14:27,258 --> 01:14:28,582
Penny!

813
01:14:28,645 --> 01:14:31,321
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

814
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,416
Sam, what happened?

815
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:37,246
Oh my God.
-We're gonna get you out.

816
01:14:37,366 --> 01:14:38,711
Shit.

817
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:43,002
Are you okay?

818
01:14:43,058 --> 01:14:45,888
I'm okay.
Penny, come on.

819
01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:48,569
Guys, we need to get
out of here.

820
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:50,615
Pull down one of the drapes.
-Okay, wait.

821
01:14:50,664 --> 01:14:52,632
Come on, quickly.

822
01:15:05,431 --> 01:15:07,996
Alright, i've got it.
Now pull.

823
01:15:13,057 --> 01:15:16,607
I've got a good foot hold.
Keep pulling.

824
01:15:26,307 --> 01:15:27,656
Penny!

825
01:15:29,876 --> 01:15:30,983
Penny.

826
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:41,430
Shit.

827
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:43,490
Run!

828
01:15:54,285 --> 01:15:56,905
It's not lighting up.

829
01:15:57,416 --> 01:16:00,253
Shit!
-I don't hear anything in here.

830
01:16:00,814 --> 01:16:04,016
Stairs, where's the stairs?
-I don't think there are stairs in this building.

831
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:05,238
What?

832
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:07,788
The landlord told us when we moved in.
There's no stairs.

833
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,860
There's stairs in every building,
we're just have to find them.

834
01:16:11,476 --> 01:16:13,578
Okay, i'll help you carry Penny.

835
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,818
Wait, wait.

836
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:17,869
I'll come back for her when we find the stairs.
It'll be faster that way.

837
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:21,188
Okay, let's check the far corners of the building.
That would be our best bet.

838
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:26,785
Do you really think there's gonna be stairs
at the end of this?

839
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:30,183
This building's gotta end somewhere.
It's worth looking.

840
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:34,112
Wait, did you hear that?

841
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,429
Yeah.

842
01:16:41,136 --> 01:16:42,861
Wait, hold on.

843
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:50,788
What are you doing?

844
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:52,852
My flashlight keeps going out.

845
01:16:52,972 --> 01:16:54,904
I'm just trying to get some light.

846
01:17:11,325 --> 01:17:13,217
Come up here,
walk with me.

847
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:24,908
Do you know where the fire escape is?
-I have no idea.

848
01:17:31,906 --> 01:17:34,491
Sophia, run!

849
01:17:35,878 --> 01:17:37,198
Sam!

850
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,204
Let me out!

851
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:50,698
Sophia, help me!

852
01:17:53,424 --> 01:17:55,666
Astrid, pull!

853
01:17:55,715 --> 01:17:57,273
No!

854
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:00,439
It's not moving!

855
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:02,402
Sophia!

856
01:18:12,258 --> 01:18:13,813
Astrid!

857
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:17,305
Okay.

858
01:18:18,355 --> 01:18:20,275
I'm gonna go find another door.

859
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:23,612
Please, no!
No!

860
01:18:23,654 --> 01:18:25,861
Sophia!

861
01:19:18,135 --> 01:19:19,445
Hello?

862
01:19:30,214 --> 01:19:31,650
Who are you?

863
01:19:32,297 --> 01:19:34,273
Just an old man..

864
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,301
Forgotten up here with..

865
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:41,228
Someone around you is passing.

866
01:19:42,293 --> 01:19:43,806
Dying.

867
01:19:43,926 --> 01:19:46,473
And holding on very tightly.

868
01:19:47,103 --> 01:19:49,317
Is it someone close to you?

869
01:19:49,437 --> 01:19:51,552
You should let him go.

870
01:19:52,658 --> 01:19:54,291
I can't.

871
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:18,251
Hello?

872
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,577
Who are you?

873
01:20:30,963 --> 01:20:35,137
Just an old man,
forgotten up here with..

874
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:40,378
Someone around you is passing.

875
01:20:41,107 --> 01:20:45,102
Dying.
And holding on very tightly.

876
01:20:45,775 --> 01:20:48,180
Is it someone close to you?

877
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,500
You should let him go.

878
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:52,963
I can't.

879
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:55,947
Chances are he's too far gone
to bring back.

880
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:58,035
But i heard him scream.

881
01:20:58,155 --> 01:21:00,207
I know he's alive.

882
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,520
Eventhough he's holding on..

883
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,072
He would be gone soon.

884
01:21:05,743 --> 01:21:08,347
And all of this,
will be gone with him.

885
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:12,104
You don't believe me.

886
01:21:13,349 --> 01:21:17,198
A window opens when you die.

887
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:19,546
Between here and there.

888
01:21:20,288 --> 01:21:23,042
And in an infested place like this..

889
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:25,926
The beasts are running free.

890
01:21:27,171 --> 01:21:32,732
Just because you're so desperately want
none of this to exist..

891
01:21:33,376 --> 01:21:36,369
You can't change the fact
that it does.

892
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:39,463
And that we are all around you.

893
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,581
Always.

894
01:21:41,701 --> 01:21:45,623
You never find him if you don't believe
where he is.

895
01:21:45,743 --> 01:21:48,360
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because..

896
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,976
They won't stop until he's
completely gone.

897
01:21:52,196 --> 01:21:53,626
Who?

898
01:21:53,662 --> 01:21:55,021
Them.

899
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:57,883
The demons and the dead.

900
01:21:58,192 --> 01:22:02,818
There's a world out here,
constantly peddling.

901
01:22:02,938 --> 01:22:05,383
If you keep looking for him..

902
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:08,402
They might take you too.

903
01:22:08,817 --> 01:22:12,178
But if this is real,
then why are you here?

904
01:22:12,298 --> 01:22:16,071
Why aren't you in some
better place?

905
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:19,405
Too much pain to leave
just yet.

906
01:22:20,862 --> 01:22:22,857
You'll find nothing but..

907
01:22:22,919 --> 01:22:25,282
Tortured souls here.

908
01:22:25,402 --> 01:22:28,496
The ones at peace
had gone.

909
01:22:28,822 --> 01:22:31,264
Why did they take him from me?

910
01:22:31,384 --> 01:22:35,961
He must've opened himself to them
or chose to let them in.

911
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:38,039
He wouldn't do that.

912
01:22:38,348 --> 01:22:40,864
You'd be surprised.

913
01:22:40,984 --> 01:22:45,044
They'll crawled into any opening
they can find.

914
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:48,398
How am i supposed to
believe any of this?

915
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:51,475
Not only are you going to have to believe
it's real..

916
01:22:51,595 --> 01:22:55,713
But you must throw yourself
in the middle of it.

917
01:22:58,244 --> 01:23:01,563
You want to find him and bring him back?

918
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:06,054
Then you're going to have to
join him first.

919
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,658
Hello?

920
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,796
Hello?

921
01:24:40,457 --> 01:24:42,046
Can you hear me?

922
01:25:56,671 --> 01:25:58,357
Are you okay?

923
01:25:58,477 --> 01:25:59,998
I'm fine.

924
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,370
But i heard screaming.
-It wasn't me.

925
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:07,947
Did you find anything?

926
01:26:08,477 --> 01:26:10,287
No, nothing.

927
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,485
Come with me.

928
01:26:12,605 --> 01:26:13,915
Where?

929
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,574
Just come.

930
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,858
This should work.

931
01:26:30,132 --> 01:26:31,977
Why are we stopping?

932
01:26:32,511 --> 01:26:36,395
Look at you , sweetheart.
You have to sit down for a second.

933
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:39,232
We've been at this for hours.

934
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:43,849
There's no way we're gonna find Adam
if we don't rest and catch our breath.

935
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:49,954
Lie down.
Just for a minute.

936
01:26:54,739 --> 01:26:56,504
Come on.

937
01:26:57,272 --> 01:26:58,914
Okay.

938
01:27:13,866 --> 01:27:16,011
Where did you get this necklace?

939
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,359
My dad.

940
01:27:19,212 --> 01:27:22,787
It's funny cause i had a charm bracelet
that matches it..

941
01:27:22,907 --> 01:27:25,356
I lost it the last time
i was here.

942
01:27:26,009 --> 01:27:27,854
Maybe my couch ate it.

943
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,511
I'll look for it tomorrow.

944
01:27:31,314 --> 01:27:35,287
You know what they say about people
whose stuff goes missing around here..

945
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:39,604
Stop it.
-I don't know, i thought you didn't believe in it.

946
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:42,421
So? It's creepy.

947
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:48,288
You don't think that crazy lady under the bed
has anything to do with it, do you?

948
01:27:48,408 --> 01:27:51,246
I'm seriously never staying here again.

949
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:54,001
What? I don't think so.

950
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:56,191
You're not going anywhere.

951
01:27:56,311 --> 01:27:59,271
I'm not gonna let any crazy lady
steal your stuff.

952
01:27:59,391 --> 01:28:03,479
Good, cause i don't want to die
in despair and into nothingness.

953
01:28:05,139 --> 01:28:07,671
You think i'm weird, don't you?

954
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,449
I do think that.

955
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:15,614
Does it freak you out
that i'm always dreading death?

956
01:28:15,734 --> 01:28:17,573
I just think..

957
01:28:17,693 --> 01:28:20,080
You think there's nothing,
but maybe..

958
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,437
Maybe there's something.

959
01:28:36,829 --> 01:28:38,621
What are you doing?

960
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:43,150
I didn't want to wake you.

961
01:28:46,153 --> 01:28:48,304
There's hot water in here.

962
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:51,786
I just felt so disgusting.

963
01:28:52,937 --> 01:28:55,550
I haven't felt clean in so long.

964
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:01,109
Where's my necklace?

965
01:29:01,991 --> 01:29:04,939
Wait, how long have i been asleep?

966
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:08,436
15 minutes.

967
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,311
He's not up here, Sophia.

968
01:29:11,932 --> 01:29:15,154
I think it's time we stop looking.
-I heard him.

969
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:18,410
What's wrong with you?

970
01:29:19,379 --> 01:29:21,497
I think you need some more sleep.

971
01:29:22,147 --> 01:29:23,531
What?

972
01:29:24,288 --> 01:29:25,891
You're not thinking clearly.

973
01:29:25,933 --> 01:29:28,497
I can't just leave you here.
Get up!

974
01:29:30,033 --> 01:29:32,201
I've seen the way
you look at me.

975
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:35,379
You're intimidated.

976
01:29:35,831 --> 01:29:37,745
I know.

977
01:29:38,564 --> 01:29:40,542
But listen to me, Sophia.

978
01:29:41,429 --> 01:29:44,240
There's a chance Adam
didn't want you to find him.

979
01:29:45,299 --> 01:29:47,854
You're a little too damaged for him.

980
01:29:48,045 --> 01:29:50,446
I think he figured that out.

981
01:29:51,506 --> 01:29:53,815
You shouldn't even
be up here, Sophia.

982
01:29:53,998 --> 01:29:55,644
Did you think of that?

983
01:29:56,096 --> 01:29:57,818
What are you doing?

984
01:29:58,686 --> 01:30:00,656
Just trying to be your friend.

985
01:30:00,847 --> 01:30:02,884
You deserve honesty.

986
01:30:04,558 --> 01:30:06,543
You're not my friend.

987
01:31:04,482 --> 01:31:06,883
It was supposed to be me.

988
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:14,897
Adam, where are you?

989
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:30,089
Where are you?

990
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:38,616
Where are you?

991
01:31:51,054 --> 01:31:53,007
Sophia..

992
01:31:53,802 --> 01:31:55,638
Adam?

993
01:32:00,977 --> 01:32:02,787
Found what you're looking for?

994
01:32:02,907 --> 01:32:04,952
They came for me,
not Adam.

995
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:07,654
You don't know that.

996
01:32:07,698 --> 01:32:10,125
These are my things
that have been missing.

997
01:32:10,602 --> 01:32:12,591
He's up here.

998
01:32:12,829 --> 01:32:14,904
I just have to revive him.

999
01:32:15,024 --> 01:32:17,287
You can't.
You have to find his body first.

1000
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,227
I know how to find him.

1001
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:20,604
What do you mean?

1002
01:32:20,724 --> 01:32:22,414
I have to join him.

1003
01:32:22,608 --> 01:32:24,276
You have to what?

1004
01:32:24,396 --> 01:32:26,334
Do you know CPR?

1005
01:32:26,454 --> 01:32:28,726
Why?
-Do you or not?

1006
01:32:28,846 --> 01:32:31,339
Yes i know CPR, Sophia.
Why?

1007
01:32:32,052 --> 01:32:34,162
Because i need you to kill me.

1008
01:32:38,894 --> 01:32:40,006
Okay.

1009
01:32:40,218 --> 01:32:42,099
It's pretty cold now.

1010
01:32:42,219 --> 01:32:44,279
This isn't going to work.

1011
01:32:44,376 --> 01:32:46,054
It could.

1012
01:32:46,174 --> 01:32:47,873
You don't even know he's dead.

1013
01:32:47,993 --> 01:32:51,607
He was screaming before.
And i just heard him whisper.

1014
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:54,724
Do you really think
he would do this for you?

1015
01:32:54,844 --> 01:32:56,728
He already did.

1016
01:32:58,167 --> 01:33:02,131
You're gonna have to hold me down
no matter how hard i fight.

1017
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:04,268
Yes.
-Okay.

1018
01:33:04,388 --> 01:33:06,611
I can find him out there.

1019
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:09,339
Then we just have to go straight to his body
and revive him.

1020
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:11,342
Let me see your watch.

1021
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,444
Alright.

1022
01:33:14,842 --> 01:33:17,375
Once i stop moving,
pull me out of the water.

1023
01:33:17,495 --> 01:33:21,129
I can last about 6 minutes
without any permanent damage.

1024
01:33:21,249 --> 01:33:23,283
All i need is 3 minutes.

1025
01:33:23,403 --> 01:33:26,156
After 3 minutes,
start CPR.

1026
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:30,119
Whatever you do,
don't let this get to 6.

1027
01:33:30,711 --> 01:33:33,438
All i need you to do
is bring me back.

1028
01:34:54,283 --> 01:34:55,660
Sophia!

1029
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:00,325
Penny.

1030
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,460
Penny, i'm so sorry.

1031
01:35:17,867 --> 01:35:19,647
It's okay.

1032
01:35:25,337 --> 01:35:27,110
It's okay.

1033
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,541
Sophia!
Astrid!

1034
01:35:36,661 --> 01:35:38,148
Wait..

1035
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:13,855
Sophia!

1036
01:36:22,907 --> 01:36:24,803
No, no..

1037
01:36:24,923 --> 01:36:27,584
Don't leave me.
Please!

1038
01:38:07,936 --> 01:38:09,938
Sophia!

1039
01:39:34,363 --> 01:39:37,397
Sophia?
Astrid?

1040
01:39:38,798 --> 01:39:41,728
Oh God, i thought it was over.
Did you see the..

1041
01:39:41,848 --> 01:39:44,069
What the fuck is going on?

1042
01:39:45,078 --> 01:39:47,249
How long has she been under?

1043
01:39:49,297 --> 01:39:51,134
Sophia.

1044
01:39:51,254 --> 01:39:53,952
She's not breathing.
Astrid!

1045
01:41:03,742 --> 01:41:05,244
Sophia!

1046
01:41:05,842 --> 01:41:07,582
Adam!

1047
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,891
Sophia!

1048
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:19,877
Adam!

1049
01:41:28,545 --> 01:41:31,624
Fuck..
What?

1050
01:41:34,145 --> 01:41:35,731
Come on!

1051
01:41:42,934 --> 01:41:44,659
You're not giving up, girl.

1052
01:41:44,713 --> 01:41:46,360
You are not giving up!

1053
01:41:46,414 --> 01:41:47,785
Help!

1054
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:51,841
Adam!
Where are you?

1055
01:41:51,961 --> 01:41:53,488
Adam?

1056
01:41:55,445 --> 01:41:57,524
That's it.
Come on.

1057
01:41:58,573 --> 01:42:02,069
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1058
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,942
Come on,
come back.

1059
01:42:05,062 --> 01:42:08,052
That's it.
Sophia, that's it.

1060
01:42:11,424 --> 01:42:14,121
Adam, where are you?

1061
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:23,358
Sophia.

1062
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:28,529
You have to go back.
