Morning, Mr. Chapin.

Busy day, Jessica.

7
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,982
No time to lie in bed.

8
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,984
Man, you are early.

[Dan] Oh-ho. I know
you'’re not really asleep.

12
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,652
Yes, I am.

13
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,089
We have to be at the office
in ten minutes.[singing]

14
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,656
I'’m taking a sick day.

15
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,484
Tell the boss
I'’ve got malaria.

16
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,312
I'’m the boss and so are you.

17
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,009
Mmm, I keep forgetting

18
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,707
whose idea was to start
this business anyway?

19
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,622
My love, today is Thursday.

20
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:25,710
What starts tomorrow?

21
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,190
Oh, yes! [whispers]

22
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,018
Ten days with no phones,

-no faxes, no beepers.
-[Jessica] No faxes, no beepers.

24
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,283
I promise.

25
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,329
You promise it won'’t be
fives years before our
next vacation.

26
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,026
You'’re sorry
you married a working man?

27
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:38,158
Absolutely.

28
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,769

Shouldn'’t you be back
at the office doing paper work?

34
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,382
Well I heard the call.
I was passing by.
Do you mind?

35
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,645
Not at all.

36
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:31,776
I can always use the voice
of experience. Right?

37
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,691
Listen, I when we got married

38
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,738
I said I'’d stay out
of you cases but--

39
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,261
[Beth] Her name
is Catharine Dobson.

40
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,958
She'’s been missing
about three hours.

41
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,004
Doesn'’t look like
she met a friend. Does it?

42
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,225
Morning shift
should be in by now.

43
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:48,663
Maybe they can... dispatch can
pull some bodies for...

[Beth] Greg, what do you have?

51
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,501
Sergeant Meyer, call dispatch.

52
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,982
Tell them to pull everyone
they can get them down here.

53
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,723
[Greg] Juvi, vice, everyone.

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,029
I want a grid search
of the entire neighborhood.

55
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:53,467
Tell them first uh,
I want to talk
the old lady'’s kids, whoever.

56
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,990
And I need a sector map now.

57
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,165
[Meyer] You think
someone'’s got her?

58
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,645
Let'’s just get moving all right?

59
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,998
[Dan] Tammy, get me Stevens
to Chicago.

60
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,000
Jack'’s got a flat tire.

61
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,871
Thanks.

62
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,047
Hey, Bob, do you think
in between bites on that donut,

63
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,832
you can let me know
when Sid gets here?

64
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,269
Mr. Lowenstein
asked for him specifically.

65
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,401
Yes, boss.

66
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,361
Hey, buddy,
you look a little stressed.

67
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,884
I don'’t believe in stress.

68
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,408
[laughs] Weekly numbers
are all down,

69
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:22,800
we didn'’t even lose
that much money.

70
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,193
Frank, you'’re a prince.

71
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,455
You know it.

72
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,764
[Beth] It'’s been six hours.

73
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,070
Where would he take her?
To his house?

74
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,204
[Greg] If it'’s close.

75
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,858
[Beth] He'’s not gonna want
go too far with her in the car.

76
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,990
-Right?
-Hm-mm.

77
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,775
[Beth] If not home,
some place close,
some place private.

78
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,172
The river.

79
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,783
[Beth] Now it'’s got lots
of woods up there,

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,350
it'’s pretty thick
this time of the year.

81
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,308
Nice and private.

82
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:55,964

[suspenseful music playing]

84
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,539
We need twice as many men
to cover this area.

85
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,150
[yells] Detectives,
we got blood here.

86
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,198
Took two steps
and there it was.

87
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,331
There'’s no trail.
Just a few drops.

88
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,551
Is it human?

89
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,988
[Greg] Spend all afternoon
for an injured rabbit.

90
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,078
Sergeant, let'’s focus
the search here.

91
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,819
Line them up along this path.

92
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,386
And then walk them
straight back into the woods.

93
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:27,561
We'’re running out of time.

94
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,998
[Meyer] [yells]
Fall in. Fall in

95
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,566
[Beth] I want everyone
in a straight line.

96
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,699
Fan out 20 meters
on either side of me. Okay?

97
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,267
[Meyer] Come on
spread out, spread out.

98
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,312
So that I don'’t want you
to miss anything, all right?

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,185
You can take it over here,
straight back.

100
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,189
[eerie music playing]

101
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:48,364
Beth.

102
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,497
She'’s right here.

103
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,848
[intense music playing]

104
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,464
[sighs]

105
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,124
She was stabbed and strangled.

106
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,866
I can'’t say yet
which killed her.

107
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:14,521
And it looks as if she
was raped as well.

108
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,261
[sighs] Thanks, Ryle.

109
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:18,002
Call me when you know,
all right?

110
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:27,316
[Beth]Sixteen years old.

111
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,276
Let'’s go tell the parents.

112
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,151
No, I'’ll do that.

113
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,370
You stay here
and get on this thing.

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,589
All right?

115
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:54,474
Come on.

116
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,606
Let'’s get to work.

117
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,874
Well, Mr. Hardaway,
you are very welcome.

118
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,920
You work hard.
You just seem like a man
who needed

119
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,312
some base ball tickets.

121
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,577
No, thank you, Mr. Hardaway.

122
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,493
-Did he enjoy the game?
-You bet.

123
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,712
And next month 75
visiting insurance brokers

124
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,758
will be riding
a Rayner Limousines.

125
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,021
You are so lucky
you have me.

126
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,414
-A shameless manipulator.
-[chuckles]

127
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,981
It'’s five o'clock.

128
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:25,766
I have message
from the office staff.

129
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:26,897
[yells playfully]
Get out of here.

130
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,856
Nice respect from our employees.

131
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,858
We should fire them.

132
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,337
You can'’t fire me, I've known
you since you were three.

133
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,644
Oh, I have to call
Ron Baker at the bank.

134
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,690
-Crises is at seven
we keep looking at.
-I'’ll take care of it.

135
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,561
I got Jack stuck in Chicago.
[clapping]

136
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,997
-Mr. Wolenstine...
-Out.

[indistinct chatter
and clapping]

138
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,523
You'’re gonna take care of it.

139
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,569
[woman] I'’ll be thinking
about you.

140
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,310
-[girl] Jessica.
-Hey, how'’re you doing?

141
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,052
Jessica, we were
catching caterpillar.

142
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,619
Oh, that sounds like fun.

143
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:53,707
So we almost missed you.

144
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:55,404
Trying to kick '’em out.

145
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:58,189
Hey, Jessica, can I see inside
the limousines?

146
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,583
Sure you can, sweetheart.
Come with me.

147
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,411
So you'’ll bring in the mail
while we'’re gone?

148
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,108
Yeah, no problem. I just
came by to get the keys.

149
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,893
[Jessica] Oh,
they'’re in there honey.

150
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,590
Did you hear
about Katie Dobson?

151
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,287
Someone killed her.

152
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,593
They found her body
at the river this morning.

153
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,511
Do they know who did it?

154
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,644
No idea. That'’s what
makes it so scary.

155
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:19,907
[Jessica] Oh, God.

156
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:22,039
Went to school
with her mom.

157
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,651
Well, you guys picked
a good time to go out of town.

158
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,087
Yeah.

159
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,523
Got to go, have fun.

162
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,510
I'’m never gonna get this.

163
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,470
Yeah, it'’s beautiful.

164
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,777
I guess it doesn'’t matter
if I catch it.

It'’s suppose
to be fun, remember.

168
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,652
You'’re doing great.

169
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,092
[laughs]

170
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,659
Did I get you?
Are you okay?

171
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,226
Okay.

172
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:19,270
I'’m the fish
you want to catch?

173
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,361
[Jessica] I can hook off now.

174
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,233
[Dan] I can untangle.
Hold on a second.

175
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,713
[Jessica] I need your help.

00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,336
-Water is delicious.
-Yeah?

179
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,991
Listen, [clearing throat]
this is almost ready.

180
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,515
So we should think
about getting changed.

181
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,690
Okay.

182
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,649
[mellow music playing]

183
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,827
[moaning]

184
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,442
[mellow piano playing]

185
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,063
Wanna help?

186
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,978
[chuckles]

187
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,806
[crickets chirping]

188
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,048
[Dan] I'’m not gonna
go if you'’re gonna go.

189
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:44,312
Right. Like my fish dinner
was interrupted if you...

190
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,575
-Carol forgot
to lock the door.
-Oh.

191
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,708
You sister is not
doing the job very well.

192
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,797
-We'’re gonna
have to cut her salary.
-[Jessica laughing]

193
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,147
Hey, Carol, you here?

194
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,237
-I'’ll call her.
-Go ahead.

195
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,501
[Dan sighing in exhaustion]

196
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,329
-[Dan] You'’re cooking.
-[Jessica chuckles]

197
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,593
Hi, we'’re home.

198
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,813
Oh, it was amazing.
Just perfect.

199
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,989
No. [chuckles]

200
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,600
Listen, did you happen
to leave the door unlocked?

201
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,602
Carol said she'’s positive
she locked up

202
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,647
and she'’s pretty good
about things like...

203
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,173
that.

204
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,873
Please tell me you did this.

205
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,009
[Jessica] Oh, couple
of CDs, what else?

206
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,272
Oh, bottle of scotch.
Can you believe that?

207
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,056
Jess, I am so sorry.

208
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,145
-I could have sworn
I locked the door.
-No.

209
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,365
Carol, sergeant Meyer'’s said,
he came in through this window,

210
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,801
and out through
the front door.

211
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,150
I was supposed
to watch the house.

212
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,499
Oh, forget it.

213
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,153
He hardly took
anything anyway.

214
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,851
It'’s just weird.

215
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,853
Weird is right.

216
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,855
It'’s almost like he just wanted
to go through your things.

217
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,726
I'’m sure he was very bored.

218
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,511
Okay.

219
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,687
Everything upstairs is fine.

220
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,385
Do you have every thing
you need, sergeant?

221
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,474
Yes, sir, Mr. Rayner.
[sighing]

222
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,258
I'’ll put everything out
in the wire but

223
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,608
truthfully I wouldn'’t
be too optimistic.

224
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,610
You know,
could have been teenagers.

225
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,308
If you'’re gonna keep
the windows open,

226
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,397
you might wanna look
into getting an alarm.

227
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,747
Yeah, okay,
we'’ll think about it.
Thank you, sergeant.

228
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,621
[door closes]

229
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,972
That'’s wonderful.

230
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:20,669
[Dan] Somebody robs your home,

231
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,714
and the police say,
get an alarm.

232
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,281
Just wonderful.

233
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,980
I do have to say
this guy was very tidy.

234
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,677
Little piles of clothes,

235
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,332
screen placed
neatly on the chair.

236
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,900
Your kind of burglar.

237
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,859
I'’m going to St. Louis
with Frank tomorrow night
for that meeting.

238
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,775
I think you should
stay at Carols.

239
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,777
Absolutely.

240
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,518
-I think it'’s a good idea.
-Dan, Dan, Dan, no.

241
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:45,041
She lives right up
the street,

242
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,695
it'’ll take four seconds
to get here.

243
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,393
Okay?

244
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,917
Now let'’s talk about dinner.
I'’m starving.

245
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:52,832
Let me help.

246
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,402
What did you mean
my kind of burglar?

247
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:01,928
[indistinct chattering]

248
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,019
I think I'’ll be heading out
to meet with Sandy

249
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,629
at five about buying
those stretch limos.

250
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,239
Don'’t just talk numbers
with Sandy.

251
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,067
We'’ll get a better deal
if he likes you.

252
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:12,677
Well I'’ll sweep him off his feet
and be home by midnight.

253
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,549
-Okay.
-Stretch limos,
can you believe it?

254
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,420
Two tycoons. That'’s us.

255
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,770
Look, honey, I know you
and Frank love those river boats

256
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,990
so if you wanna
stay overnight and gamble...

257
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,992
that'’s fine, okay?

258
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,039
-Stay and gamble?
Never crossed my mind.
-[chuckles]

259
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,911
Hey, you ready
to lose some money?

260
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,957
This was supposed
to be a business trip, remember?

261
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,742
Oh, yeah. What'’s it gonna be,
cracks or blackjack?

262
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:35,787
See you tomorrow.

263
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,919
Have fun.

268
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,517
You'’re back?

[ominous music continues]

270
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,046
Dan?

271
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,753
Honey?

272
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:41,810
Dan?

273
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,118
Is that you?

274
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,559

No, no, no.
[crying]

286
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,053
No, no, no...

[muffled cry]

295
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,522
You are beautiful.

296
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:29,744
You, are so beautiful.

Mr. Chapin. [mumbles]

Mr. Chapin...
[mumbling tearfully]

00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:58,425
[woman over PA system]

304
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,600
Where is she?
Where'’s my wife?

305
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:00,992
-Mr. Rayner?
-Yeah.

306
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,299
-I'’m sorry.
-Is it bad? Is she alive?

307
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,931
She'’s alive.
Mr. Rayner is you could
just take a minute, please.

308
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:06,781
-Look, I want to see her.
-I'’m sorry, you can't.

309
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,609
-What do mean...
-Sir, your wife
has been assaulted.

310
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,176
I'’m here to make sure
she remains safe.

311
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:11,481
Now go to the waiting
area, Mr. Rayner!

312
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,918
-Please, I can'’t please.
-Let him go.

313
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:16,834
[Frank] Go see her.
Go see Jessica.

314
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,272
He'’s sorry. Okay?
He'’s sorry.

315
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,925
Let me get you
a cup of coffee.

[somber music playing]

317
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,592
Jessie?

318
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,251
[Jessica] How was St. Louis?

319
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,254
Did you win?

320
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,745
What happened?

321
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,709
Someone came into the house.

322
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,234
I was asleep.

323
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,282
I thought it was you.
[sobbing]

324
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,764
I thought it was you.

[shushing]

326
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,596
It'’s okay.

327
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:25,860
It'’s okay.

328
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,819
[indistinct chattering]

329
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,867
Greg Corning.

330
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,521
How are you?
I haven'’t seen you in years.

331
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,392
Hi, Frank, I'’m fine.

332
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,133
Little over-worked.

333
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,743
Anything you can do to to help
these people out,

334
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,659
I'’d appreciate it.
They'’re my family.

335
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,792
I'’ll make it
as easy as possible.

336
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,011
-Is she up for answering
some questions?
-Yeah.

337
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,195
You should go in.

338
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:58,980
Dan?

339
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,982
Danny?

340
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:02,853
Come on, buddy.

341
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,817
And I went to bed about 11:00.

342
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,951
All right.
About the attack...

343
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,171
this one thing
I have to ask you
straight away.

344
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,393
Were you sexually assaulted?

345
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,787
What?

346
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:26,007
We should do a rape kit
as soon as possible.

347
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,405
I don'’t know
I was kind of out of it.

348
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,189
She would remember
if that happened.

349
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,757
She did get a pretty good
knock in the head.

350
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,066
She would remember
something like that.

351
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,898
You don'’t need
a rape kit.

352
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,684
Dan I...
[hesitatingly]

353
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,688
I think it'’s a good idea.

354
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,867
[camera flash clicks]
This won'’t be much longer
now, Jessica.

355
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,653
Just breath for me.
Take a deep breath.

356
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,264
-Okay.
-Just one more.

357
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,791
It'’s almost done.

358
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,141
[Carol] Just hang in there.

359
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,056
Good.

360
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,842
Jessica, get dressed now.

361
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,457
[Jessica] Brownish hair,
baggy eyes

362
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,285
weak chin.

363
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,419
He was taller than me.
5'’10" maybe.

364
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,247
He had rough skin.

365
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:34,815
And he smelled.

366
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,860
You have a good eye, Jessica.

367
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,384
You should have been
a detective.

368
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,951
[chuckles]
Maybe in my next life.

369
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,302
Hmm.

370
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,174
Okay, let'’s just go over
this again from the beginning.

371
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,610
[Greg] You had dinner--

372
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,917
You know this is totally
ridiculous, okay.

373
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,093
She'’s been over it
three times already.

374
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,356
Why aren'’t you out there
looking for this guy?

375
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,576
-Dan...
-Maybe you should
wait outside, Dan.

376
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,404
So that you can waste
some more time?

377
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,928
No. No, I think not.

378
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,716
All right, detective, time
is over.

379
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,804
[door shuts]

380
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,023
I'’m almost finished, doc.

381
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,025
Great.
Did I ask you a question?

382
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,288
[doctor] She needs sleep
now go, get.

383
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,072
[doctor chuckles]

384
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,509
You'’re the doc.
I'’ll see you tomorrow, Jessie.

385
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,860
[doctor] Well your x-rays
came back negative.

386
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,557
That'’s a hard little
noggin you'’ve got up there.

387
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,732
[both laugh]

388
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,081
Let me take a peak.

389
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,214
[door slams]

390
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:30,174
Dan, he'’s just doing his job.

391
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,959
[doctor] And that looks
perfect.

392
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,440
[sighs] Now.

393
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,138
I'’m gonna give you
something to help you sleep.

394
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:39,880
And Dan here
is going to go across
the street to Curlies diner

395
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:42,361
and get himself something
to eat besides coffee.

396
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,668
I recommend
the meat loaf sandwich

397
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,496
but then that'’s up to him.

398
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,674
I'’ll be right outside.
I promise.

399
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:52,980
[door clicks open]

400
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,245
[sighs]

401
00:22:57,332 --> 00:23:00,074
Sent Carol home.
She'’s exhausted.
How is Jessica?

402
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,685
She'’s in the hospital, Frank.

403
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:05,340
She was raped.
How do you think
she is?

404
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,734
Greg said, she gave
a great description.

405
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,605
The jerk cop
wouldn'’t leave her alone.

406
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,564
She'’s exhausted.
Can'’t he tell that?

407
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,826
You want a cup of coffee?

408
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,393
No, I don'’t want
a cup of coffee.

409
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,831
Yeah, yeah, look I'’ll get it.

410
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,835
[woman over PA system]

411
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,534
[exhales]

412
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,104
Glad she'’s okay, Dan.

413
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:34,543
Well, if it isn'’t Sam Spade.
[sarcastically]

414
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,286
You just can'’t seem to leave.

415
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:41,768
I guess you'’re convinced
that this guy is some where
in the hospital.

416
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:42,856
Is that it?

417
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,205
Maybe he is.

418
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,470
There'’s few questions
I wanted to ask you.

419
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:51,430
[Dan sighs]

420
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,301
I told you,

421
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,129
I don'’t know anybody
who'’d do something like this.

422
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:56,609
Mm-hm.

423
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,002
[vending machine pops]

424
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,874
You were in St. Louis
the whole night.
That'’s what you said, right?

425
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:05,922
What are you getting at?

426
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,185
You think I did this?

427
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,274
To my own wife?

428
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,365
People do it everyday, Dan.

429
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,586
Even worse than this.

430
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,893
[woman over PA system]

431
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,816
-Where you going?
-I'’m gonna find this guy.

432
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,731
What are you talking about?
Do you know who he is?

433
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,689
No, but I know
what he looks like.

434
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,474
You know what the police know.
They'’re already looking.

435
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,258
I'’m afraid the police
don'’t know squat Frank.

436
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:39,652
I know this town
and I'’m gonna find him.

437
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:42,306
All right.

438
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:46,093
[Jessica] Dan?

439
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,486
[gulps]

440
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,357
Where'’s Dan?

441
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,186
Where'’s my husband?

442
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,883
Honey, you should try
to get some sleep.

443
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,494
But where is he?

444
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,584
I need to see him.

445
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:00,890
He'’ll be back.

446
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,457
Now. [shushing]

447
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,285
Try to sleep.

448
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,078
[door slams]

449
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:16,558
[man] What is your problem?

450
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:17,864
[Dan] You'’re my problem.

451
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,387
-[scrambling]
-[Frank] Dan!

453
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,130
[breathing heavily]

454
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,915
You know every
weasel in this town.

455
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,830
Now you tell me
what you heard.

456
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,789
I haven'’t heard anything.
What are you talking about?

457
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:31,181
Dan!

458
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,322
You should be locked up,
you know that?

459
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,978
His wife was raped
last night.

460
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:49,243
I want to know
who did this!

461
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,637
Come on, Dan.
Let'’s go home.
Come on.

462
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:54,248
Come on, get in the car.

463
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,510
[groaning]

464
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,340
[mumbling]

[exhales]

467
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,842
Who are these people?

468
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:24,452
They'’re installing the alarm.

469
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,498
[indistinct chattering]

470
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,978
[hammer banging]

471
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:30,545
[exhales]
Hey, Bill.

472
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,765
Hey, Mr. Rayner.

473
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:35,681
Mrs. Rayner, my boys
will be out of your way
in a few minutes.

474
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:37,073
-Show you how it works?
-Sure.

475
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,902
It'’s all pretty simple.

476
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,948
You'’ve got your
security code,

477
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,340
areas of coverage...

478
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,560
This indicates the zones,
doors, window.

479
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,127
Now, if there'’s someone
in the house--

480
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,650
[clears throat]
Can we...

481
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,304
Can we please
do this later?

482
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:52,132
Sure, sure.

483
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,308
Why don'’t you sit
and get ready for bed.

484
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,401
Jess, you should sleep
much better now.

485
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,840
Excuse me.

486
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,320
[metal clanging]

487
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,500
Well, you stay safe.

488
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:13,632
Thank, bro.

489
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,559

[crickets chirping]

491
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,766
Dan?

00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,506
[footsteps approaching]

493
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,073
Dan?

494
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,509
Every thing is set, honey.

495
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,294
The alarm is on.

496
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:08,687
Go on to sleep,
you'’re safe.

497
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,298
Aren'’t you coming?

498
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,126
I don'’t want you
to worry, all right?

499
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,477
I just thought
I'’d keep an eye on things.

500
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:18,566
You go on to sleep.

501
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,220
Go ahead.

[bed spring creaking]

504
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,594
There'’s no such thing
as too much food.

505
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,466
We need to get your
strength back
with ice-creams and cookies.

506
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,773
Oh, shut up and pamper
yourself for a change.

507
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,123
I'’m gonna pamper myself
right up 300 pounds.

508
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,691
Dan would love that.

509
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:59,085
He'’s so relieved you're okay.
He doesn'’t care how many
cookies you eat.

510
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,826
[snickers]

511
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,523
No, Carol, it'’s been so...

512
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:04,568
awkward.

513
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,615
He hasn'’t...

514
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:09,704
he hasn'’t been
affectionate. He...

515
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:11,750
can hardly look at me.

516
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:15,623
Well, it'’s gonna
take some time.

517
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,146
It can'’t be easy.

518
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,887
Yeah, it'’s like some
damaged goods.

519
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,410
Don'’t say that.
He doesn'’t think that way.

520
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,673
Don'’t even joke about that.

521
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,458
Can you drop me
at the police station?

522
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:26,068
What police?

523
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:28,114
They have to do
the sketch this afternoon.

524
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,639
Guess they want you
to do it while you
still remember.

525
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:34,250
I can wait ten years.
I will never forget.

526
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:39,690
He just kept smiling
the whole time.

527
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:44,478
Sometimes I think
he liked it so much
he wants to come back.

528
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,698
That'’s not gonna happen.

529
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,178
He knows the police
are looking for him everywhere.

530
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,224
He'’s a million miles
away by now.

531
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:53,400
I guarantee it.

532
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,490
I'’ll take the cart back.

533
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,679
[suspenseful music playing]

534
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,734
Jess?

535
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,782
[Jessica] Another one.

536
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,005
Oh, my god.

537
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,925
[indistinct chattering]

538
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,711
Cheek bones were...

539
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,495
sharper, higher.

540
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,802
You'’re good.

541
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,283
Most people come in here
and they say, "he was tall."

542
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,286
Okay.

543
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,289
How does it look?

544
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:00,859
It'’s him.

545
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,559
Still in with the artist, huh?

546
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:07,735
Detective, I called you
this morning.

547
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,258
Well, I knew you'’d be
coming in today

548
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,434
and I thought it would
be a better use of time.

549
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,002
When I call you,
you drop your donut
and pick up your phone.

550
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,832
Wanna know what I did
this morning, Dan?

551
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,226
Yeah, I want to know
what did you do this morning.

552
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:23,577
Got in at 6:00 am,
and I spent five hours
looking at tread templates

553
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,536
trying to find a match
for that sneaker footprint
in your walk way.

554
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,975
This isn'’t going fast enough
for me either,

555
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,367
but things take time.

556
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:32,716
And there'’s nothing...

557
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,893
nothing I can do about that.

558
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:37,983
Detective.

559
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,247
You know about this.

560
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,422
Thank you.
[clearing throat]

561
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:43,814
Sara MacMillan.

562
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,817
My sister is a friend
of the family

563
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,776
and she saw the police cars
there this morning.

564
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,390
I'’m sure it's the same man
who attacked me.

565
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:56,479
The same man
who attacked Katie Dobson.

566
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,873
They'’re kids, Jessica.

567
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,746
But it'’s all
in our neighborhood.

568
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,140
We'’re working
that angle

569
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:07,577
but believe me, I'’ve been
on the force a long time

570
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:09,623
and I'’ve seen
a few cases like this.

571
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,320
Now this kind of criminal,

572
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,758
they have a very
specific victim profile.

573
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,847
And you and this kid

574
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,676
and Katie Dobson
they couldn'’t be
more different than--

575
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:21,461
It'’s him.

576
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,071
I know it.

577
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:28,685
Well, we won'’t ignore
any possibility.

578
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:31,427
But right now
I'’d like to get the sketch
to the deputy chief

579
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,908
and get it out
to the Illinois state police.

580
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:50,620
We'’ll check it out, Dan,
but it isn'’t the same man.

581
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,535
I don'’t know
who this guy is.

582
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,103
But can'’t you see
what'’s happening?

583
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,845
I mean she'’s getting worse.

584
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,717
You got to catch
this guy fast.

585
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,416
Please.

586
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,202
We'’re trying.

587
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:10,858
But what your wife'’s
going through
is completely normal.

588
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,120
None of it is normal.

589
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,122
None of it.

590
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,875
Just wait here,
Mr. and Mrs. MacMillan.

591
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:30,443
-I'’ll get a car
to take you home.
-Thank you.

592
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,579
[indistinct chattering]

593
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:47,373
I am sorry.

594
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,897
You'’re the MacMillans,
aren'’t you?

595
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,420
Do we know you?

596
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,901
No. [hesitatingly]
I'’m Jessica Rayner

597
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,817
and I live over at
North Maple and...

598
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,516
Well I read

599
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,127
what happened
to your daughter.

600
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:05,913
How is she?

601
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,741
We don'’t know.

602
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,091
She'’s in the hospital.

603
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,094
[exhales nervously]

604
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,835
Well, I'’m here because...

605
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:22,060
because a man attacked me...

606
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:23,931
in my house.

607
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,543
And I thought, maybe, that...

608
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,722
Can you tell me...

609
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,595
anything?
Can you tell me

610
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,031
[hesitatingly]
how it happened?

611
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,163
We were asleep.

612
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:41,905
We heard her crying and...

613
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,953
We went in
and he'’d gone already.

614
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,781
Did she tell you
what he looked like?

615
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:50,436
[James] No he...
[sighs]

616
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,655
put a pillow case over her head.
She didn'’t see anything.

617
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:55,484
Did he say
anything to her?

618
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:58,052
He said he thought
she was beautiful.

619
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,969
-[intercom buzzing]
-Yeah.

620
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:05,059
There'’s a Mrs. Rayner out here.
She very insistent.

621
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:07,801
All right.

622
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,846
[door clicks open]

623
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,674
Detective, I need
to talk to you.

624
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:13,459
Mrs. Rayner,
Deputy Chief Lasser.

625
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:14,547
Why don'’t you sit down?

626
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,026
No, thank you.

627
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,334
Detective Corning,
it is the same man

628
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,597
who attacked me that
attacked Sara MacMillan.

629
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,338
I talked to her parents.

630
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,819
[Greg] Look you shouldn'’t--

631
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,429
-I asked them about
the attack and they said--
-[Chief Lasser] Mrs. Rayner?

632
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,909
Let me make this clear.

633
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:31,868
I understand your feelings

634
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:34,915
of helplessness
and I sympathize.

635
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:39,398
But I won'’t tolerate
interference in other
active cases.

636
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:40,921
It doesn'’t match
the profile.

637
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,576
He doesn'’t care
about your profile.

638
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,014
He'’s an animal.

639
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,149
I saw his eyes.

640
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,588
He raped me.

641
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:58,808
And he raped Sara MacMillan

642
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,723
and he'’s probably
raped other women.

643
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,508
And he'’s gonna
keep on doing it

644
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,163
until someone stops him.

645
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,312
[door shuts]

646
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,533
[Greg sighs]

647
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,839
Maybe she'’s not
too far off, chief.

648
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,929
Three attacks
on the north side in a month,

649
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,801
I mean something'’s going on.

650
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,370
What was she doing

651
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:39,632
talking to those people?

652
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,072
Don'’t lose control
of this case.

653
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,248
I won'’t have freelance cops.

654
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:49,946
Understand?

655
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,297
Yes, sir.

656
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,528
God, Jessica, you scared
the hell out of me.

657
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,138
-Where did you go?
-Dan, they don'’t believe me.

658
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,097
They don'’t think
it'’s the same man.

659
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,272
-They won'’t listen--
-Tell me when
you'’re gonna disappear

660
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,665
like that again.
Okay? Please.

661
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,710
Dan?

662
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,843
You believe me, don'’t you?

663
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,801
Jessica, I need to know
where you are.

664
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,368
How can I keep you safe
if I don'’t know where you are?

665
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,848
Now let'’s go home, all right?

666
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,719
[Dan exhales]

667
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,245
Can we talk about
this at home, please?

668
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:30,030
Come on.

669
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,819
[thunder rumbling]

670
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,005
Look, I just have to go
into the office
for a couple of hours.

671
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,007
I'’ll just get some
deals finished.

672
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,227
We'’re not gonna be able
to pay the loan this month.

673
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,275
But it'’ll be all right.
Don'’t worry.

674
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,976
If you feel weird
or anything call me.

675
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,891
I'’ll have this
with me all day.

676
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:07,720
I can be home
in four minutes.

677
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:13,726
Memory one,
that'’s the cellular number.

678
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,162
Okay?

Hello, Jessie?

685
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,533
Dan, oh my god,
it'’s him.

686
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,273
Jessie!

687
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,058
Jessie, hang on.

689
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,148
Where are you?

690
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,279
Jessie, I'’ll be there
in a minute. All right?

691
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,542
Just hang on.

God damn it! Jessie!

00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,770
I can'’t hear you. Dan?

[alarm continues blaring]

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,171

Go from the other
side all right?

705
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:58,934
Hey, he was here.

706
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,459
[Dan] Jessie, you'’re all right?

707
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:03,939
He was here. The screen
is on the chair, there'’s foot
print in the bushes.

708
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,593
[Jessica] He came
in through the window.

709
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,335
He...

710
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:10,555
[alarm stops]

711
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:13,427
He...

712
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,955
But it was right...

713
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,828
Jesus!
[whispers]

714
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:25,265
Look I understand
she'’s upset and a lot
of things could happen.

715
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:27,659
-Thank you very much.
-All right.

716
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,399
Appreciate it. Bye.

717
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,929
Look, Jessie...
[thoughtfully]

718
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:39,932
it'’s a stormy day.

719
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,586
The screen could
have been blown out.

720
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,849
-It'’s your first day--
-Look, I know what I saw.

721
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,503
I am not crazy.

722
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,680
It was him. I know it was.
He came back.

723
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,511
[sighing]

724
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,121
Okay.

725
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:04,304
[ominous music playing]

726
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,962
[Dan] I'’m heading out.

727
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:11,659
I called Carol.
She'’ll be here
in a little while.

728
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,183
[Dan sighs]

729
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,100
I love you.

730
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:20,276
Me too.

731
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:36,423
[ominous music playing]

732
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:12,372
[suspenseful music playing]

733
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:42,402
Hi, honey.

734
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,801
What is this?

735
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:54,066
There was a girl raped
and killed last year.

736
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,502
Eileen Murphy,
seven blocks away.

737
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:56,808
He'’s been doing it
since then.

738
00:43:56,895 --> 00:43:57,939
Jessie?

739
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:00,333
Eileen Murphy, Katie Dobson,

740
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,944
Sara MacMillan and me.
Four of us and two are dead.

741
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:04,424
I'’m just one
of the lucky ones.

742
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,082
Now I'’m a witness.

743
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:12,171
He needs to come back
to finish the job.

744
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:14,086
You know I think you should
put these all away.

745
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:16,392
[exhales]

746
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:18,612
Jessica?

747
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:32,147
[crickets chirping]

748
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:40,678
[door thuds]

749
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:44,594
[board creaking]

750
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,466
[thumping]

751
00:44:52,211 --> 00:44:53,429
[whispers]
Dan.

752
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,781
Dan.

753
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:58,304
What? What?

754
00:44:58,391 --> 00:44:59,784
-I heard something down stairs.
-Okay.

755
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,220
I'’ll just take this.

756
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:02,656
I'’ll go take a look.

757
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,312
[suspenseful music playing]

758
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,278
[footsteps running]

759
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,845
-[Jessica] It'’s him.
-[door open and shuts]

760
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:19,325
[alarm blaring]

761
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:26,419
[dogs barking]

762
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,775
He'’s coming back.

763
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,300
He'’s coming back for me.

764
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:45,177
The guy came
right into the house.

765
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,614
He didn'’t even set off
the alarm until after he left.

766
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,529
Well, we cranked
the sensitivity all the way up.

767
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,357
That plus the new
sensors will help.

768
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,620
I have to tell you Mr. Rayner,
our system is perfect.

769
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:55,056
I don'’t care
what it costs, Bill.

770
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:56,536
Make it perfect. Okay?

771
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:58,494
Okay.

772
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:02,455
How you doing, Lou?

773
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,543
Hey, Mr. Rayner.

774
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:06,502
I did this
on all the doors.

775
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,592
Set the hole double deep,
goes right into the frame.

776
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,811
Go on and bolt this.

777
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,770
See, inside the lock.

778
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:13,858
Watch this.

779
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,775
[thumping]

780
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,341
Okay?

781
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:21,126
Now, you want to keep
this key some place handy

782
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:23,041
because without it

783
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:25,043
you'’ll have to bust that wall
down to get out of here.

784
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,740
-Yeah. Thanks, Lou.
-Okay.

785
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,572
[drill machine whizzing]

786
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:35,401
[man] Excuse me.

787
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,621
You know when
these guys are done,

788
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,275
it'’s gonna be
just like Fort Knox.

789
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:41,973
It doesn'’t matter.
He'’ll find a way in.

790
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,235
-Jessi--
-He will.

791
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:45,628
Jessie, he knows
we have an alarm.

792
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:47,152
He knows
I'’m waiting up for him.

793
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,154
I mean the police
are practically

794
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:50,808
camped out
in the neighborhood.

795
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,984
He'’d be an idiot
to try to come back here.

796
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:57,815
Can you try not
to worry, please?

797
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:00,687
Please.

798
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:02,994
[door slams shut]

799
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:07,650
[Greg] We are taking
the break-in
very seriously, Dan.

800
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:10,305
Half the forces is working
on your case in one way
or the other.

801
00:47:10,392 --> 00:47:12,264
Then why is this guy
still out?

802
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,483
Because he'’s lucky.

803
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,268
He won'’t be lucky forever.

804
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,052
It'’s already been forever.

805
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,620
Greg, please,
my wife'’s going crazy.

806
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:22,883
She can'’t sleep.

807
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,276
I mean I can'’t sleep.

808
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:26,844
When are you gonna
catch this guy?

809
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:29,585
I--

810
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:31,283
[Dan exhales]

811
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:44,644
Busy?

812
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,516
This Dobson case...

813
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,258
You know, this is every
sex offender

814
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:52,826
in the state of Illinois that
owns a beige or brown sedan.

815
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:55,437
Seems someone may have seen
one parked by the river.

816
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:59,050
The deputy chief cleared
over time as much as you need.

817
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:01,922
[Greg] You could get some other
officers to do that for you.

818
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,359
I know. I just--

819
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:05,839
I don'’t wanna
miss anything.

820
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:07,972
We did get a break today.

821
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,582
The lab test came back.

822
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:10,800
Seems as though
some of the blood we found

823
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,367
does not belong
to Katie Dobson.

824
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:14,848
Our boy has left us
a calling card.

825
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,719
Hurray!
[sarcastically]

826
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,678
We should get preliminary
DNA back in two weeks or so

827
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:21,724
and as soon as we catch him,
he'’s as good as convicted.

828
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:25,772
Ahem, [clearing throat]
I won'’t make it home
for dinner tonight.

829
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,731
Oh, you want to sneak out
for burger later?

830
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:31,299
Hey, young lady,
don'’t you know

831
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,171
that fraternization
with a senior officer

832
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:35,521
is strictly against
the department policy?

833
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:37,827
Yeah, I remember reading
about that somewhere.

834
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,397
[Greg thoughtfully]

835
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,269
Could you do me a favor?

836
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:45,661
Anything.

837
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:48,490
When the DNA test
come back,

838
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:51,102
I'’d like to check them
against the semen sample
of Jessica Rayner

839
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:53,104
and Sara MacMillan.

840
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,366
You think they'’re connected?

841
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:56,977
Maybe.

842
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,372
Jessie, we'’ve been
through this already.

843
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,243
I told you the guy lives
in the neighborhood. Right?

844
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,810
-Dan, please listen--
-He must

845
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:05,377
because he seems
to know his way around.

846
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:07,945
I figured if we cruise
around long enough,

847
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:09,076
we'’ll be able to spot him.

848
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:10,730
-Dan.
-Look.

849
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:12,862
I called Carol
and she'’s on her way over.

850
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,386
Please don'’t go.

851
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:16,040
[knock at the door]

852
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:17,128
[door clicks open]

853
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:20,827
Hi.

854
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:22,133
I don'’t want
you doing this.

855
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,830
You'’re preaching
to the converted.

856
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,658
Look you pay taxes.

857
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:26,789
Why don'’t you let the cops
drive around all night?

858
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,313
Dan, please.

859
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,445
Jess, just make sure
the alarm is set.

860
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:37,931
[door shuts]

861
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:49,595
Look how empty it is.

862
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,076
There'’s nobody
out here.

863
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:58,038
Somebody must be
pretty scared, huh?

864
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,304
How is Jessica?

865
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,045
She'’ll be fine
once I catch this guy.

866
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:06,612
Now keep your eyes open.

867
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,182
[siren wails]

868
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:17,144
[police officer] Oh, it'’s you,
Mr. Rayner, take care.

869
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:23,020
He'’s sure out of the force.

870
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:26,545
I got stopped on my way
over to your house.

871
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:29,156
Yeah, well whatever
they'’re doing, it isn't enough.

872
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:40,341
I can'’t believe Dan
just took off like that.

873
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:43,649
With all that'’s happened,
I can'’t believe he'd
leave you alone at night.

874
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,391
I'’m not alone.

875
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:47,870
For gods sakes, Jessi
he shouldn'’t be out there

876
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:50,830
roaming the streets
like some vigilante.

877
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:53,485
You were almost killed,
he should be home.

878
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:56,227
In case anything else
happens, he should be here
to protect you.

879
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:59,099
I don'’t want him
to do that. Okay?

880
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,884
I don'’t want him
to protect me.
I just want him to--

881
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:07,107
I just want him
to hold me.

882
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,804
Oh, Jess.

883
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:11,938
He hasn'’t touched me.
Not once, not since...

884
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:13,113
[sighs softly]

885
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:16,290
I know he'’s trying
to be so strong and...

886
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:17,857
and I don'’t care. I just...

887
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:26,039
I don'’t know if he
wants me anymore.

888
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:29,912
I want him so much.
I need him.

889
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,790
Dan, it'’s getting late.

890
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:40,749
I think we should go home.

891
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,101
[suspenseful music playing]

892
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,626
It'’s him, it's him!

895
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:54,111
Dan!

[tires screeching]

897
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,205
Dan, just wait.

898
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,208
-Stop.
-Hey, easy, easy.

899
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,470
Stop right there!

900
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:06,601
All right.

901
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,037
What are you
doing here, huh?

902
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,604
-Easy, easy.
-Frank?

903
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:11,128
Easy. Hold it, Dan.

904
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,477
Frank, what the hell
is going on here.

905
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:14,479
For gods sakes,
it'’s Rick Stanzo.

906
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:16,002
He lives in the neighborhood.

907
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:17,699
He'’s been living here
for ten years.

908
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:22,704
[exhales]

909
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,623
Rick, I'’m really sorry.

910
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:30,277
I'’m sorry, Rick

911
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:33,802
Listen, what are you
trying to do?

912
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,761
Waving a gun around,
you'’re gonna kill somebody.

913
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:37,980
He'’s out there, Frank.

914
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:40,592
Ease up, Dan.

915
00:52:42,768 --> 00:52:45,074
He started this, not me.

916
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:47,816
You'’re acting crazy.

917
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,255
[eerie music playing]

918
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:53,039
"Crazy."

919
00:52:57,783 --> 00:52:59,698
I don'’t think
he'’s coming back.

920
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,570
But we are set up
for him this time.

921
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:04,485
[door shuts]

922
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:06,922
You can go to sleep.
Just go to sleep.

923
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:11,927
I'’m staying up for him.

924
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:14,060
Today I'’m staying up
for that bastard.

925
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:15,627
What? What is it?

926
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,716
Let'’s go to bed.

927
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:18,978
No.

928
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,023
We both can'’t sleep.

929
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,417
You sleep.

930
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,897
I'’ll stay awake,
I'’ll keep watch--

931
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:27,204
Dan, hon,
come to bed please.

932
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:32,165
I want us to make love.
I need you.

933
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:36,691
No. I shouldn'’t.

934
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,695
No, I'’ve to check
the windows.

935
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:44,090
Now you go,
you go to sleep.

936
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:47,224
I'’ll keep watch.
I'’ll be here, I will.

937
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:49,704
I promise I'’ll be here.

938
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,015

[Jessica crying]

940
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:36,534
Hi, Jessica.

941
00:54:36,621 --> 00:54:38,927
-How'’re you feeling?
-I'’m all right, detective.

942
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:44,846
I wanted to know
if there was anyway that...

943
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:47,327
I could see the police report
on my case.

944
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:50,983
Those reports
are not for the public.

945
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:56,162
Why would you
want to see them anyway?

946
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:59,252
I just need to make
some sense of all this.

947
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:03,865
All right.

948
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:06,868
But you'’ll have to look
at them here.

949
00:55:08,479 --> 00:55:09,436
[door knocking]

950
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:19,403
Mrs. MacMillan,
I'’m Jessica Rayner.

951
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,361
We met at the police station.

952
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:22,797
I remember you.

953
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:36,463
I was wondering if we could
talk about the attack.

954
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:40,467
This is where he went in.

955
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:41,903
This is Sara'’s room.

956
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:44,253
She doesn'’t...

957
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:46,821
She sleeps in our room now.

958
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:00,922

[phone continues ringing]

961
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:43,182
Dan?

962
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,926
Dan Rayner'’s office.

963
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,016
No, Steve,
he'’s on another line.

964
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:55,499
Yeah. I'’ll give him
the message.

965
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:57,414
Bye.

966
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:01,896
I'’ll leave you alone.

967
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,031
Everything was so good.

968
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,904
The business was finally
coming together.

969
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,473
We had some
extra money to spend...

970
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,866
For the first time.

971
00:57:17,129 --> 00:57:19,218
Everything was so good...

972
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:21,394
then this.

973
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,052
In one night.

974
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:31,491
I go away and...

975
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:33,362
everything good
just disappears.

976
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:36,453
Oh, God!

977
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,542
In one night.

978
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:45,549
Dan, things will get better.

979
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:47,725
It just takes time.

980
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:49,248
I'’ve got the alarm

981
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:51,250
and I stay up all night

982
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:53,208
just to make sure
nothing happens.

983
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:57,822
And now she'’s reading

984
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:00,085
her police files and...

985
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:03,480
copying articles
out of news papers.

[sighing in despair]

988
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:16,884
She doesn'’t think
I can protect her.

989
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:19,365
She'’s been through hell.

990
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:22,586
All the alarm systems
in world aren'’t going
to make her forget that.

991
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:25,284
She'’s got to put
this behind her.

992
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:28,330
How?

993
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,202
You got to start
doing things again.
Normal things.

994
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:34,380
Believe me.

995
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,471
It'’s the only way
you'’re gonna feel right again.

996
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:41,518
[footsteps walk away]

997
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:52,050
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

998
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:54,922
Are you okay?
You know I called all day.

999
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:56,881
I just needed
to get out of the house.

1000
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:58,317
[Dan] Uh-ha.

1001
00:58:58,404 --> 00:58:59,797
What'’s that?

1002
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:01,494
You'’re having a cleaning fit?

1003
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:02,669
No. [CHUCKLES]

1004
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,193
Will put a grill
tomorrow night.

1005
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:07,631
I invited Carol

1006
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:09,328
and Frank and some
of the people from the office.

1007
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,417
Party?

1008
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:13,898
No, it'’s not a party,
it'’s a barbecue.

1009
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:16,509
You know, then I get to wear
my funny chef'’s hat.

1010
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,642
I don'’t know, Dan.

1011
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:20,731
Oh, Jessica, please.

1012
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:25,170
We need it.

1013
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,041
We both do.

1014
00:59:27,738 --> 00:59:29,261
I mean,
we need to make--

1015
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,480
We need to make things
normal again. Okay?

1016
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:34,745
Okay.

1017
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:36,268
Great.

1018
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:38,357
All I need now
is a fine chef'’s hat.

1032
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:37,868
I know. It doesn'’t make
any sense.

Two women murdered,
two more raped.

1034

are tracking down leads

When the hell is that DNA
test coming?

I don'’t know. Next week.

I know you'’re
the veteran at this

with any predator rapist
I'’ve ever read about.

They don'’t even look
like each other.

1043
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,766
Well, they'’re all pretty tall
and blonde.

1044
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:08,289
Yeah except for

1045
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:10,074
-Sara MacMillan.
-Sara MacMillan, yeah.

1046
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:11,902
Throw her into the mix
and it messes everything up.

1047
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,599
I know.

01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:16,210

have to do with any of this?

1051

He wasn'’t after Sara.
He was after the mother.

1052
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:29,528
We'’re gonna have to pull
every unsolved murder
or rape in the past five years.

1053
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:31,878
See if there'’s
any other cases.

1054
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:33,488
Yeah, I'’m gonna go back
over all the tests and see
what matches up.

1055
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,577
When that DNA
comes in, we can be sure.

1056
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:38,363
I don'’t need any DNA.
I'’m sure already. Come on.

[soft guitar music playing]

1058
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:51,898
One burnt to crisp
for me, Dan.

1059
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:53,378
Absolutely.

1060
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,423
Here you go.

1061
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,817
You know, Frank,
you'’re absolutely right.

1062
01:02:57,904 --> 01:02:59,210
This is a great idea.

1063
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,125
Thanks.

1064
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,430
Great food.
It'’s thanks enough.

1065
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:11,526
She knows about
that woman last night, huh?

1066
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:14,616
Hmm, she wouldn'’t
talk about it.

1067
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:17,141
She'’s not getting
any better, Frank.

1068
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:20,231
[guitar music continue]

1069
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,496
I'’m heading out
to the store.

1070
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,106
We need some more
trash bags.

1071
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:27,629
Could you stay?
I don'’t want to leave her alone.

1072
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:28,717
Yeah, sure thing.

1073
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,600
Do you think we should
pull out those bushes?

1074
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:46,300
Because he could hide in there
like he did before and just

1075
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:47,649
jump out.

1076
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:51,175
Yeah, I could do it tomorrow.

1077
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:52,741
Dan and I will trim it back.

1078
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,787
Maybe.

1079
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:57,398
Maybe that would be better.
Maybe that would be a good idea.

1080
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:58,835
Hmm.

1081
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,445
You need a hand?
Come on.

1082
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:02,447
Move over.
I'’m an expert.

1083
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:05,711
He killed another woman
last night, you know.

1084
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,626
Yeah, I know.

1085
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:10,237
[water gushing]

1086
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:12,196
He'’s coming
back for me. He...

1087
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:14,285
He needs to kill me
because I'’ve seen him.

1088
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,288
Jessica,

1089
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:20,160
you'’re totally
right to be scared,

1090
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:22,293
but have you considered
seeing someone?

1091
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,035
You know a psychiatrist.
Someone to help you deal
with this obsession--

1092
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:26,775
It'’s not an obsession.

1093
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,603
Yeah, maybe that'’s
not the right word but--

1094
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:29,778
[crashing]

1095
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,824
[alarm blaring]

1096
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:35,480
[intense music playing]

1097
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,011
Maybe you don'’t need
a psychiatrist.

1098
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,232
[Greg] Yeah, tell him
I'’ll hold.

1099
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,756
He was in the house.
I mean, he was five
feet away.

1100
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:54,673
He only ran because he heard
a man'’s voice.

1101
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,763
What if she'’d been alone?
God knows what would
have happened.

1102
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,808
She'’s been saying all along
he was coming back.

1103
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,985
[snickers] She'’s been
saying it all along.

1104
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:03,334
Do you believe her now?

1105
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,944
Yes, Frank, I believe that.

1106
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:06,032
You do?

1107
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:08,513
Well, of course, you do.

1108
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,123
What are you gonna
do about it?

1109
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,169
Yeah, well, look tell him
to hurry up, huh?

1110
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:14,736
Look, Frank we have every
available car focused
on the north side.

1111
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:17,696
We'’ve pulled everyone,
traffic, vice, office cops.

1112
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:21,439
Everyone'’s on triple shifts
working this case
looking for this guy.

1113
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:23,963
-[sergeant] Detective.
-Yeah.

1114
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,530
All right.

1115
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:27,532
He was in the house.

1116
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:29,142
In the middle of the day.
[snickers]

1117
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,970
This guy'’s got some guts.

1118
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:35,061
Jessie, you'’re okay?

1119
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:37,194
-I have to go.
-What are you doing?

1120
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:39,631
I have to go,
I have to leave.

1121
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:41,198
Jess, where are you going?

1122
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:42,895
I can'’t stay here.

1123
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:44,505
To move away, another city,

1124
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,638
some place where
he can'’t find me.
Far away.

1125
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:49,815
Jess, you'’re not
going anywhere.

1126
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,557
We grew up on this street.
We know who lives
in every single house

1127
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:54,733
and who lived here before that
and this is our street.

1128
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,910
No, it'’s his.
It'’s his now.

1129
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,390
Jess, stop it please?

1130
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:01,827
Look,

1131
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:03,785
I'’m your sister,

1132
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:07,311
and I love you
but you can not
run away from this.

1133
01:06:07,398 --> 01:06:10,009
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

1134
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:11,837
[Carol inhales]

1135
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,926
Honey, he cannot
make you leave your home.

1136
01:06:14,405 --> 01:06:15,754
This is your home

1137
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:17,974
and you are going
to have to fight for it.

1138
01:06:21,238 --> 01:06:22,935
I don'’t know if I can.

1139
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:29,202
So what have we got?

1140
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:31,030
The guys from vice volunteered
to do foot patrols.

1141
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,206
Now I figured that
and with the extra sector cars

1142
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:36,818
we should have someone
passing by here
every ten minutes.

1143
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:37,994
Good.

1144
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,517
-See you at the station.
-Yeah.

1145
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:44,696
[Frank] Police are running now.
They know the score.

1146
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:46,524
Now things
are gonna happen.

1147
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:48,613
Police can'’t protect her.

1148
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:51,833
I can'’t protect her.

1149
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,183
I know Corning.

1150
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,793
He'’s gonna nail this guy.

1151
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:58,057
Go home, Frank.

1152
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:00,886
Please.

1153
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:02,801
Just go home.

1154
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:12,202
[breeze blowing]

1155
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,649
-Are you all right?
-I'’m fine.

1156
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,218
When was the last time
you got a night'’s sleep?

1157
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:32,483
Come to bed.

1158
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:35,007
No.

1159
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,098
I should stay down here,
in case.

1160
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:42,667
I don'’t need you down here.
I need you in bed with me.

1161
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:44,930
Look I know...

1162
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,847
I know that you
don'’t wanna touch me.

1163
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:51,545
And I understand,
I feel dirty too.

1164
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:55,245
Dirty?

1165
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:57,682
[somber music playing]

1166
01:07:58,204 --> 01:07:59,423
No.

1167
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:01,077
God, Jessica.
[tearfully]

1168
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:06,647
He could never touch
the things we had that I love.

1169
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,693
Then what is it, Dan?

1170
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,956
I have to stop him.

1171
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:14,699
I can'’t let it happen again.

1172
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:17,049
Let what happen?

1173
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:19,791
You didn'’t let
anything happen.

1174
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:24,187
I did.

1175
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:32,630
I stayed.

1176
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:39,115
While I was playing
black jack,

1177
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:41,291
he came into our house.

1178
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:44,207
If I'’d come home...

1179
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:47,601
none of this
would have happened.

1180
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:50,169
[gasps]

1181
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:51,605
It'’s all my fault.

1182
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:53,781
Don'’t you see?

1183
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:57,307
I should have been
here to protect you.

1184
01:08:57,394 --> 01:08:59,309
Sweet heart, you
cannot protect me.

1185
01:08:59,396 --> 01:09:01,311
And the police
can'’t protect me.

1186
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:04,444
I have to protect myself.

1187
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:07,230
Look, I can be scared
but I can'’t be helpless.

1188
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:08,405
But what if he should
come back?

1189
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,363
He will come back.

1190
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,583
When he does, we'’ll both
be ready for him, both of us.

1191
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,934
We won'’t be
helpless anymore.

1192
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:23,246
Come to bed.

1193
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:28,773
[Dan exhaling]

1194
01:09:58,716 --> 01:09:59,978
Then breathe.

1195
01:10:00,805 --> 01:10:02,241
Then bring the gun down.

1196
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,374
Always keep the gun
down by your side.

1197
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,420
Sure you wanna do this?

1198
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,117
You'’ve always hated guns.

1199
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,510
I do.

1200
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:12,164
Even more now.

1201
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,470
All right, bring it up,
release the safety.

1202
01:10:13,557 --> 01:10:14,558
Dan, I can'’t...

1203
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:15,950
Both eyes open.

1204
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:18,126
One breath...

1205
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:20,346
let it out slowly...

1206
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:22,957
[gunshot]

1207
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:26,134
Hey, you'’re a natural.

1208
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,658
[chuckles] Wonderful.

1209
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:29,660
Keep it down.

1210
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,836
All right, this time...

1211
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:34,317
start with the gun down,

1212
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,362
then bring it up.

1213
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:38,103
In case you have to do
this for real,

1214
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,236
you don'’t have to spend
all day aiming.

1215
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:42,281
-All right,
on the count of three.
-Okay.

1216
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:43,587
-You ready?
-Ah-ha.

1217
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:47,155
One, two, three.

1218
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,335
So much for being
a natural.

1219
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:55,251
All right, well,
you'’ll have to do
what the rest of us do.

1220
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:57,949
Practice. Come on.

1221
01:10:58,036 --> 01:11:00,865
You'’re ready?
Bring it up, fire.

1222
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:04,085
Again.

1223
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:05,739
Okay, let'’s start again
at the beginning.

1224
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:08,307
Eileen Murphy
was killed last year

1225
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:11,049
August 1st
which was a Sunday.

1226
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:12,964
Can you be sure
it was the same guy?

1227
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,879
No, but it is a good guess.

1228
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:17,795
[Jessica] Right.
Now Katie Dobson

1229
01:11:17,882 --> 01:11:19,449
was killed June 10th.

1230
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:21,233
He broke into our house

1231
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,104
on the 19th
and I was attacked
on the 21st.

1232
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:25,542
Okay, if it was the same guy.
Why did he wait a year?

1233
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:27,631
Yeah and why did he
attack you

1234
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:29,328
and Katie in the same month?

1235
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:32,766
Maybe he had a thing
for summer. I don'’t know.

1236
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:35,334
Windows are open
in the summer.

1237
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:37,510
Yeah. Smart guy you married.

1238
01:11:37,597 --> 01:11:39,120
Why is he doing that?

1239
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:41,166
Oh, he thinks better
when he'’s cleaning.

1240
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:44,082
Now this guy likes to come
after we'’ve had guests.

1241
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,215
[Frank] It makes sense.

1242
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,174
Have friends over,
had a few beers,
you'’re relaxed.

1243
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:52,003
Yeah, we set up our alarm
on the 1st and 11th.

1244
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,744
When was Debbie Gwen killed?

1245
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:57,225
Gwen, July 31st.

1246
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,932
He likes the number,
one doesn'’t he?

1247
01:12:08,628 --> 01:12:09,934
That'’s it.

1248
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:13,329
What? What are you guys
getting at?

1249
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:14,808
[Jessica] The dates.

1250
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:16,941
Days with one in them.

1251
01:12:17,028 --> 01:12:19,422
That'’s when
he likes to go out.

1252
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:22,425
Jess, half of the days
in a month have a one in them.

1253
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:24,427
The 1st, the 11th
and the 21st.

1254
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,342
Those of the days
he likes best.

1255
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:28,866
That doesn'’t make sense. Why?

1256
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:30,737
Because he'’s nuts, Frank.
That'’s why.

1257
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:32,304
And we don'’t need to know why,
we just need to know

1258
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,306
when he'’s coming back
so we can catch him.

1259
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:36,352
[Jessica] And now...

1260
01:12:36,743 --> 01:12:38,092
we know.

1261
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:39,877
See, we all kind
of look alike.

1262
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:42,706
Tall with blonde hair
except Sara MacMillan

1263
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:44,055
so I thought

1264
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:45,970
he was after the mother.

1265
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,190
You don'’t have to
convince me, Jessica,

1266
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:51,584
because the DNA report
came back this afternoon

1267
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:53,543
and it'’s a match.
You'’re right.

1268
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,806
It'’s the same man.

1269
01:12:55,893 --> 01:12:58,286
Are you absolutely sure
you don'’t wanna come
and work with us?

1270
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:01,681
Look, the really important
thing is right here.

1271
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:04,031
Take a look
at this calender.

1272
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:06,077
What are these,
all the attacks?

1273
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:09,428
See, he seems to have
an obsession
with the number one.

1274
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:13,084
I don'’t know, Jessica,
it'’s a good theory but...

1275
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:15,913
Sara MacMillan
was attacked on the 22nd.

1276
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:19,264
She was attacked at 3 am.

1277
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:22,006
He was out
looking for her on the 21st.

1278
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:24,965
He just didn'’t find her
until after mid-night.

1279
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:27,577
See, he'’s crazy.
But he'’s predictable.

1280
01:13:27,664 --> 01:13:29,056
A-ha.

1281
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:31,798
Now Saturday is the 11th,
his favorite day.

1282
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:34,061
-[Greg] And...
-We could be ready for him.

1283
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:37,717
He likes to come after a party.
We'’ll throw a party.

1284
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:38,979
He likes to come in
that window--

1285
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,372
We'’ll open the window.

1286
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:42,287
and we'’ll keep
the alarm off.

1287
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:44,898
He'’s feel totally welcome
and when he comes in

1288
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,596
we'’ll be waiting for him.

1289
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,815
It'’s a long shot.

1290
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:50,774
And I don'’t know
if I can get Lasser
to commit to man power.

1291
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:52,602
Detective...

1292
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:54,473
I cannot explain
this logically

1293
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,344
but I know in here

1294
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,564
that he'’s coming on
Saturday night.

1295
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:03,482
Okay.

1296
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:06,006
[Greg] She'’s scared,
but she'’s thinking clearly.

1297
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:08,444
She wants one cop
on post in her home

1298
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:10,489
if we can spare.

1299
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,491
Do we have anyone to spare?

1300
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:15,320
I know it'’ll mean
triple shift patrols
every night.

1301
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:18,497
[Beth] And I know
we'’ll have to take a lot
of people off the street.

1302
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,891
It'’s a crazy idea
but I think it'’s worth it.

1303
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:23,110
[Greg] Let'’s be straight
here, chief,

1304
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,895
we maybe getting
closer to this guy

1305
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:27,550
but we'’re a long way
from catching him.

1306
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:31,292
And hell, I didn'’t think
he'’s come for Jessica again.

1307
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,381
But he did.

1308
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,601
She knows

1309
01:14:35,688 --> 01:14:37,560
a little something
about the way
this creep thinks.

1310
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:39,431
[sighs]

1311
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:43,174
All right.

1312
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,786
[Chief Lasser]
Mrs. Rayner and her--

1313
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:49,310
God I'’ve been pretty sure
so far maybe we should
start listening to her.

1314
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:53,706
Greg, you got the duty.

1315
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:55,621
Start tonight.

1316
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,842
Keep it going for two weeks
and we'’ll reassess.

1317
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:00,583
Beth you coordinate
back up.

1318
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:01,671
Yes, sir.

1319
01:15:02,715 --> 01:15:03,934
Thanks, sir.

1320
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,675
Maybe we'’ll get lucky.

1321
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:11,637
And I'’m in this job
for 27 years. I thought
I gotten use to it all.

1322
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:17,382
Last three weeks I'’ve slept
in the hall outside
my daughters bedroom.

1323
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:18,470
You believe that?

1324
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:21,952
Yeah.

1325
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:24,302
You get lucky, both of you...

1326
01:15:25,782 --> 01:15:28,001
[whispers]
to catch this maniac.

1327
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:30,395
Yes, sir.

1328
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:40,492
Brought you a beer.

1329
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,713
[saxophone music playing]

1330
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:46,324
[indistinct chattering]

1331
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,680
Hey, honey.

1332
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,595
How are you holding up?

1333
01:15:57,509 --> 01:15:58,510
Tonight'’s tonight.

1334
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:03,254
[Dan clears throat]

1335
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:05,996
Come on, smile.

1336
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:08,041
It'’s supposed to be a party.

1337
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:10,957
Maybe this was
a terrible idea.

1338
01:16:11,044 --> 01:16:12,655
-You want to back out?
-[Jessica exhales]

1339
01:16:14,482 --> 01:16:15,483
No.

1340
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:17,660
I want it to be over.

1341
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:23,709
[music continues playing]

1342
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,593
-Please be careful.
-Okay.

1343
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:39,290
Thanks.

1344
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:41,684
Carol.

1345
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,686
-Hi.
-Hi.

1346
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:45,688
Should have come
for the party.
Dan'’s a grill king.

1347
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:47,559
Truly amazing.

1348
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,082
Oh, I have to spend some time
with my beautiful wife.

1349
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:50,606
She'’s starting think
I live here.

1350
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:54,044
[door shuts]

1351
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:00,964
Well, dishes are done.

1352
01:17:01,051 --> 01:17:03,401
Can'’t have him breaking
into a dirty house, can we?

1353
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,142
What about this one?

1354
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:07,100
His favorite window?

1355
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:08,711
Leave it open.

1356
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,803
Well, now that the cavalry'’s
here, I guess I'’ll head home.

1357
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,152
Thanks, Frank.

1358
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:18,416
-Goodnight, Frank.
-Goodnight, Dan.

1359
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,116
Look, if he does come by,

1360
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:25,031
don'’t bother saying halt,
just shoot him.

1361
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:26,642
Bang bang you'’re dead.

1362
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:28,165
All right.
Have a goodnight.

1363
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:29,427
[Frank] Goodnight.

1364
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:32,256
[door lock clicks]

1365
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:35,825
I got to change.

[dog barking]

1368
01:17:45,095 --> 01:17:46,792
Okay, there is food
in the fridge

1369
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,576
and cookies in the cabinet.

1370
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:52,363
I don'’t know what else to say
except thank you.

1371
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,581
Greg uh...

1372
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:56,628
You be careful. Okay?

1373
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:59,587
-Goodnight.
-Yeah, goodnight.

1374

[suspenseful music playing]

1375
01:18:14,994 --> 01:18:16,213
I'’m shaking.

1376
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:22,480
So glad you'’re with me.

1377
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,136
Me too.

-Are you okay?
-Stay there.
