Excited to see your grandma?

Yeah, what's your angle, man?
Hmm?

No angle.
I'm not doing anything.

No, no, no, no, no. No!

Don't shit in my mouth
and tell me it's chocolate cake.

GERTRUDE:
I can make that story go away...

251
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,678
I think your brother's
up to something.

252
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:00,512
No, I just decided
to let you guys

253
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,179
have all the fun
sucking up to Mom today.

254
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:05,048
Please. You are King Suck-up.

255
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:07,082
You named your kid Gertrude.

(Linda scoffs)

257
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,817
Alva, you named
your son Bertrude.

258
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,786
Okay.

259
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,720
Sorry, Bert,
but that's not a real name.

260
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:17,256
Sorry, Linda. We can't all be
lucky enough to have daughters.

261
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,489
Mom, I can hear you.

262
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,991
You know something we don't.
What is it?

263
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:24,759
No, I don't. I don't.

264
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:25,960
I got it. Bingo.

265
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,127
I'm onto you, man. Come on!

266
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,962
- We were just...
- MORGAN: Come on,

267

come on, come on, come on.

268

- GERTRUDE: You big sack of shit.
- Ooh.

269
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,131
No wonder your husband left you.

270

- Little bitch.

278

Little Gertrude. And how is
my favorite granddaughter?

279
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:58,012
Everybody calls me Trudy now.

00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,813
Trudy?

281
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,282
-Well, that makes her
sound like a whore. -Okay.

282
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,916
Oh, she doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

is a beautiful name.

Pick Jason.
He's my mom's favorite.

895
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,634
- Yep. Him.
- The one in the sweater.

896
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,103
All right.
Jason Lightstone it is.

897
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:16,304
- The number one son.
- No.

898
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:17,771
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we don't need...

899
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:19,106
We don't need to do that.
No, it's okay.

900
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:21,240
No. No, no, no.
We don't need to do this.

Don't... No. -(muttering)

All right, all right,
all right. You're right.

You're right.
Let's stop it. Let's stop it.

What are we doing here? Come on.

What are we, amateurs?
We're half-assing this.

Come on. It's not called
a finger cracker.

915

Okay, Candy Cane.

916

He wasn't asking you.

945
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:46,956
She's playing make-believe.

946
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,291
She's pretending
to talk to Santa.

1028
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:16,580
when Trudy Lightstone
wrote to me.

1029
00:51:16,614 --> 00:51:19,113
She must have been
about six years old,

1030
00:51:19,147 --> 00:51:22,983
and she said that
she felt lonely sometimes.

1031
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:25,319
She missed having a best friend.

1032
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,585
And so I brought her

1033
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:28,487
a beautiful little
stuffed rabbit.

1034
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:29,987
Mr. Bunny.

1035
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,988
And then I remember
the next year,

1036
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,056
and you said you had
this amazing dream

1037
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:38,092
and that, afterwards,
all you wanted to do was...

1038
00:51:38,124 --> 00:51:39,460
To fly!

1039
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:41,894
(laughing): To fly. To fly.

1040
00:51:43,094 --> 00:51:47,432
I mean, Santa might have
some magic, but...

1041
00:51:47,465 --> 00:51:51,233
making a little girl fly?

1042
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:57,537
But giving you a kite,

1043
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,971
floating just beneath
the clouds,

1044
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:03,607
well, it's about
as good as it gets.

1045
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:05,542
I knew it.

1046
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:08,076
I knew you were real, Santa.

1047
00:52:10,645 --> 00:52:13,845
Don't be too hard
on your parents, all right?

1048
00:52:15,414 --> 00:52:18,316
Grown-ups have a hard time
believing things.

1049
00:52:19,148 --> 00:52:21,517

1050
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:23,884

love each other again?

1051
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:26,253

1052
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:30,888
Mrs. Claus and I have been
going on year, uh,

1053
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:33,190
1,100, and...

1054
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:36,959
Grown-up relationships
are complicated.

1055
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:39,961
It takes work.

1056
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:42,096
A lot of work.

1057
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,466
Do you still love her?

1058
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,367
Yeah, I do.

1059
00:52:49,434 --> 00:52:53,001
And sometimes, even if you want
to make somebody happy...

1060
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:56,405
the magic just goes away.

1061
00:52:58,439 --> 00:53:00,640
Hey.

1062
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:02,508
I've got an idea.

1063
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,242
This will be fun.

1064
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:08,412
Why don't you guys
open your presents?

1065
00:53:08,445 --> 00:53:13,013
I want to see what you
rich assholes get each other.

1066
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:18,650
And some of you might not
make it till tomorrow morning,

1067
00:53:18,684 --> 00:53:21,885
so this could be
your only chance.

1068

Christmas dreams are bullshit.

1252
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:41,577
My father used to make
a big deal out of it

1253
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,411
every Christmas.

1254
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:45,512
Every freaking Christmas
with the presents

1255
01:02:45,546 --> 01:02:47,714
and the candy
and the decorations

1256
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:51,583
and the Christmas caroling
and all that bullshit.

1257
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:55,251

1258
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:58,587
I don't know, ten, 11,

1259
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,722
he got laid off,
and that Christmas,

1260
01:03:00,755 --> 01:03:01,956
couldn't even afford a tree.

1261
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:03,757
No Christmas dinner, no gifts.

1262

1267
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:18,531
So Christmas Eve
rolls around, and...

1268
01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:21,600
I waited for everybody
to go to bed.

1269
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:25,236
And then I snuck in there
to take it all.

1270
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,471
Only problem was that
the gramps got up to take a piss

1271
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,872
and the two of us scared
the shit out of each other.

1272
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:33,874
And, um, he fell down the stairs

1273
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:38,477
and-and broke his neck,
and he died in the hospital.

1274
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,011
Everybody thought that I did it,

1275
01:03:40,045 --> 01:03:41,746
and every time
I tried to tell them,

1276
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:44,247
I tried to tell them that...

1277
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:47,882
Anyway, maybe I did do it.

1278
01:03:47,915 --> 01:03:49,916

Christmas ruined my life.

Okay? But you know what?

1282
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:58,355
It set me on the path

1283
01:03:58,388 --> 01:04:00,389
and made me the great man
that I am today.

1284
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:02,457
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
