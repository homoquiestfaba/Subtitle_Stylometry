1
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,333
Oh, for me?

2
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,125
Out of my way.

3
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,541
Move!

4
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,625
Wicked witch!

5
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,583
Oh, hey.

6
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,333
Oh!

7
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,458
Well, that was enough for me today.

8
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,833
Look, there!

9
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,208
How dare thee!

10
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,708
Oh, Winifred Sanderson.

11
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,500
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

12
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,500
This is the worst day of my life.

13
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,583
Uh-oh.

14
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,708
But, Winnie, look what we have made.

15
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,750
I discovered if thou doth
grind pig's hooves and mix it with water,

16
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,416
it creates mysterious goo.

17
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,625
Then Mary had the wonderful idea
to mix a drop of goat's blood.

18
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,541
And look. It jiggleth. Here.

19
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,916
Taste this, Winnie.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,041
'Tis divine!

21
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,208
I cannot eat. I am too troubled.

22
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,166
Didst the Turner boys lock thee
in the hay barrack again?

23
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,333
Worse.

24
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,958
I've been told I'm getting... old,

25
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,083
and I must marry...

26
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,583
...John Pritchett.

27
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,250
Reverend Traske arranged it.

28
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,875
He said it was his duty since father died.

29
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,458
- Didst thee say no?
- Of course.

30
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,875
Then I took the Lord's name in vain twice.

31
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,541
Thou art most wicked, Winnie.

32
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,000
Only a truly wretched man
can make me say such things.

33
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,333
It was my favorite plate.

34
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,083
There, there, there, Winnie.

35
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,750
Let us forget the Reverend
and John Pritchett.

36
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,458
Wouldst thee like to open thy presents?

37
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,875
Mm.

38
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,958
You will love it.

39
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,291
We searched for the largest one
we could find.

40
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,666
- It is adorable.
- What shall we name it?

41
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,416
It is the Reverend.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,583
Hide. Act as if we're not here.

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Open the door.

44
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,166
We are not here.

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,166
Yes?

46
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,666
- Wretched soul!
- Look at her!

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,500
Winifred Sanderson.

48
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,958
I will mercifully give thee
one more chance. Oh!

49
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:57,291
Atone for thy disgusting words
and agree to marry John Pritchett.

50
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,791
- Allow me a moment to reconsider.
- Yes, of course.

51
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,583
- Mm, yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,833
- No.
- Oh, praise God.

53
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,041
- Oh, God.
- What's he said?

54
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,166
- Blasphemy!
- I apologize, Reverend.

55
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,500
It is only she is so ugly and unpleasant.

56
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,541
- I concur.
- And thou art some prize?

57
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,916
Teeth of the devil!

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,750
Oh, it is true, he is quite odd.
But how dare thou sayeth so.

59
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,083
She cannot speak that way to a man.

60
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,416
I refuse to marry that lout.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,625
If I shall marry anyone,
it will be Billy Butcher son.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, Billy?

63
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,250
- What? Why me?
- Who?

64
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,541
Because we are soul mates.

65
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,625
- Since when?
- What?

66
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,416
Since we shared that kiss
in the graveyard.

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,708
Oh, my God.

68
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,916
She relishes in her petulance.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,041
Correct. Goodbye.

70
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,416
Thou has defied
the authority of the Church.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,250
If thou doth wish
to continue in such flagrant

72
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,083
disregard of all that we hold sacrosanct,

73
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,500
thou shall not do it here.

74
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,916
A rotten apple quickly infects
its neighbor.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And we want no more like thee.

76
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,250
I banish thee from Salem.

77
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,000
Forever.

78
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,541
- Take the girls.
- What?

79
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,458
- No, no. no.
- No, no.

80
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,458
You can't do that.
Take your hands off my sisters.

81
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,333
No! Stop it!

82
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,833
But this is our home.

83
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,208
Oh, not anymore.

84
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,833
The kind Smiths have agreed
to take thy sisters

85
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,500
and turn them right!

86
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,500
- Stop! Thou cannot take my sisters!
- No! Stop!

87
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,833
- No.
- No. No.

88
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,458
Winnie, please!

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,541
- Unhand me now.
- Thou must have faith.

90
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,166
- Thou must have faith.
- No!

91
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,125
- No!
- This is for...

92
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,750
My good God.

93
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,666
- Oh, my God.
- Look at it!

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,458
- The Reverend.
- No, it's Satan's hand.

95
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,208
- Reverend, are you all right?
- I'm not all right.

96
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,500
She tried to kill the Reverend.

97
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,791
- Winnie, Winnie.
- Oh, Winnie. Winnie.

98
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,541
Quick. To the forbidden wood.

99
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,375
- But it's forbidden.
- So they will not follow. Go!

100
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,291
With thy eight legs of sin!

101
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,750
- It was on me!
- They are wicked! All of them!

102
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,541
Find it!

103
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,750
Don't toucheth me!

104
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,541
Keep up.

105
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,833
Stay close.

106
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,291
- Where are we?
- I do not know.

107
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,958
I've never been this deep
into the woods before.

108
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,958
I do not like this place.

109
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,375
Perhaps we should form a calming circle.

110
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,125
All right.

111
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,791
Think soothing thoughts.

112
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,750
The smell of fresh mud.

113
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,333
The Reverend's scream
when he saw the spider.

114
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,583
The soothing of thoughts.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,333
What was that?

116
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,791
No, Sarah!

117
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,750
- No! Stop!
- No! Stop!

118
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,500
- Thou looketh thirsty, child.
- Let her go!

119
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,416
- Why didst thou come into my woods?
- We had no choice.

120
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,250
They were gonna take my sisters.

121
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,083
Thou art different from the other children
I have eat...

122
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,000
Met.

123
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,000
They feared thou wouldst corrupt them.

124
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,250
New World. Same story.

125
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,833
But they were right to fear thee.

126
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,083
Thy temper.

127
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,541
I do not have a temper.

128
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,583
Thy...

129
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,291
power.

130
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,750
Dost thou know why
the commoners fear these woods?

131
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:01,750
This is a very sacred space for witches.

132
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,708
We come here to charge our magic.

133
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,791
To make us stronger.

134
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,291
More powerful.

135
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:18,833
This altar is what makes Salem
so very special.

136
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:19,958
Special?

137
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:24,000
- Salem is dreadful.
- Only because it is run by fools!

138
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:29,291
But one day Salem will belong to us.

139
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,208
Us?

140
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,375
Magic has a way of uniting things
that ought to be together.

141
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,916
Happy 16th birthday, child.

142
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,541
- But...
- I'm a witch. I know things.

143
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,833
Go on.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,833
Cat Transformation. Levitation Spell.

145
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,041
'Tis an apothecary book.
Like one of Father's.

146
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,791
No, 'tis a spell book.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Magicae Maxim a.
The Power Spell.

148
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,875
Oh, let's do this one.

149
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,666
Magicae Maxim a makes a witch all-powerful.

150
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,583
It is most frowned upon.

151
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,041
Doomed is the witch that uses this spell.

152
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,833
Promise thou shalt never do it.

153
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:33,875
Why?

154
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,916
Because I said so.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,041
Besides, Book does not like it.

156
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,416
Do not worry, Mister Book.

157
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,625
I shall not do that spell, I promise.

158
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,666
But what of the cat one?

159
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,083
That would be good to do
to John Pritchett.

160
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,541
Thou art lucky to have each other.

161
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,708
A witch is nothing without her coven.

162
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,166
- Where is thy coven?
- Long gone I'm afraid.

163
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,208
The world is not too fond of witches.

164
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,708
Can't imagine why.

165
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,833
Perhaps because thou eateth the children?

166
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:19,125
How else does one stay young
and ridiculously beautiful?

167
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,041
How can I ever thank thee?

168
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,708
She turned into leaves.

169
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,208
What will we do with it, Winnie?

170
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,125
Keep up!

171
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,625
Okay, Mister Book,
shall we get some revenge?

172
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,333
"The Spell of Smoke and Flame."

173
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,166
"Upon thy house so full of lies..."

174
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,666
<i>- "Ichita cop it a melaka mystica."
- "Ichita cop it a melaka mystica."</i>

175
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,166
"Bring my wrath, may fire rise!"

176
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,416
It worked. It worked.

177
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,708
Oh, my God.

178
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,041
Fire! Wake up!

179
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,708
Wake up!

180
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,791
Now they shall never take us.

181
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,500
Now we'll be together forever.

182
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,166
This is Satan's work! Hurry!
Throw the water!

183
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,125
Oh, this is the work of the spider!

184
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,458
Can you feel it?

185
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,666
It's all around us. It's evil. It's evil!

186
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,416
Happy birthday.

187
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,208
- Did I get you?
- Yeah, you, you got me.

188
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,458
Oh, so my mom is, of course,
thrilled you're sleeping over tonight.

189
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,500
- Well, Susan loves an event.
- Yes, she really does.

190
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,583
Oh, incoming.

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,791
- Hey. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

192
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,458
Uh...

193
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,250
So what are you guys doing tonight?

194
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,625
Birthday rituals, scary movie marathon.
Same as every year, you know?

195
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,041
Yeah.

196
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,333
Hey, babe. Sorry, I'm late.

197
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,208
I decided to have two breakfasts.

198
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,625
Oh, and you got to come
check out Brian's car.

199
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,041
We covered the entire thing in tinfoil.

200
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,958
Why?

201
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,583
Because it's funny.

202
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,875
Mike, come on, let's go.

203
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,208
- Come on.
- See you.

204
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,458
Well, that's a start, right?

205
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,041
Why would she ask about our plans?
She knows what we're doing.

206
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,416
Maybe she was hoping you'd invite her?

207
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,458
Izz, if she wanted to hang out
with us on my birthday,

208
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,125
she'd probably have hung out with us
one other time in the last four months.

209
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,250
I know, but still, it's our tradition.

210
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,833
Yeah, maybe.

211
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,500
What do you need good luck for?

212
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,875
- Ten bucks says we have a pop quiz today.
- Ooh.

213
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,416
Hey, Cassie?

214
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:08,000
- About tonight, I was...
- Dude, it's gonna be awesome.

215
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,625
- What is?
- Our party.

216
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,083
At Cassie's. You're coming, right?

217
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,333
We invited the whole grade.

218
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,750
Even Glenn.

219
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,958
Yo, Glenn.

220
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,250
- Glenn.
- What?

221
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,666
- That's so Glenn.
- You're throwing a party tonight?

222
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,208
How is that even possible?

223
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,458
Your dad would never let you do that.

224
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,625
It was my idea.

225
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,583
I told you I wanted to talk
to them about it first.

226
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,250
Oh, do you guys want to talk now?

227
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,375
No, it's fine.
We don't have anything to talk about.

228
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,000
- Have fun at your party.
- Becca, come on.

229
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,833
Are you guys gone
a be busy doing witchery?

230
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,083
What? The three of you
used to do witch stuff every Halloween.

231
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,125
- It's not witch stuff.
- Then what's that?

232
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,583
A good luck charm
in case there's a pop quiz.

233
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,708
Well, I hope not,
because I didn't do the reading.

234
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,041
Good morning, ghouls and goblins.

235
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,333
In honor of Halloween,
I've prepared the scariest class possible.

236
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,375
- Is he a banana?
- A pop quiz.

237
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,583
Of course.

238
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,250
You knew that was gonna happen.

239
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,041
Mr. Wilke's a jerk.

240
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,875
Of course, he'd give us
a pop quiz on Halloween.

241
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,791
I made an inference.

242
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,500
- Is that a spell?
- Okay. Let's begin.

243
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,416
Focus.

244
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,375
Tempeh, soyrizo, aquafaba, garbanzo,

245
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,166
cacao, spirulina, crimini, seitan!

246
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,583
What did you do?

247
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,333
Everyone settle down.

248
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,708
- Here's your quiz.
- She was muttering some weird,

249
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,375
scary language, right, babe?

250
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,500
You heard it.

251
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,708
I...

252
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,666
It did sound like you said "Satan."

253
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,333
I said "seitan."
I was literally listing vegan food.

254
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,791
See. She admits it.

255
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,166
That's enough.
Mike, Becca, Principal's office. Now.

256
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,958
Busted!

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,583
- Great.
- Quiet down.

258
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,041
Making sure Mike doesn't get lost?

259
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,208
Look, your dad is going
to find out about your party.

260
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,875
And when he does, you're gonna be grounded

261
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,041
until at least college.

262
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,708
Why do you care? You're not even coming.

263
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,125
I'm not coming because we just heard
about it from Mike.

264
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,541
As if that would have made any difference.

265
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,416
Hey, you finished your test pretty fast.

266
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,500
Can't believe you guys
are still doing the birthday ritual.

267
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,041
We started doing that, what,
when we were, like, 5?

268
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,083
We get it, Cassie.

269
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,375
You're too cool for it now.

270
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,416
Guys, come on.

271
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,250
Saturday detention.

272
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,166
Thanks a lot.

273
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,875
Principal's ready to see you now, Becca.

274
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,583
Yeah, I can't wait.

275
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,541
- I know, right? Let's go.
- Like what?

276
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,375
This carnival gets crazier
and crazier every year.

277
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh, wow.

278
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,166
Cassie made it on the billboard this time.

279
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,916
Huh.

280
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,833
You know, Cassie's family dates back
to the witch trials.

281
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,583
Must be why this is Mr. Traske's
favorite holiday.

282
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,958
He did a great job
with the decorations.

283
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:36,875
- Looks pretty good.
- Becca?

284
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,791
- Kinda...
- Izzy?

285
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,458
Hey.

286
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,708
- Mr. Traske. How's it going?
- Hey.

287
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,250
How are you?

288
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,666
Right?

289
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,666
- Yes.
- Are you heading to your sacred circle?

290
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,333
We actually don't call it
the sacred circle anymore.

291
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,250
- Felt, felt a little bit dramatic.
- Oh, that's a bummer.

292
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,208
Oh, my gosh.

293
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,583
Remember when Cassie would bring,
like, 10 flashlights with us?

294
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,541
Right.

295
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,583
Ten.

296
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,208
Did you say 10?

297
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,833
- Yeah, it's really funny.
- Yeah.

298
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,291
Oh, that's good.

299
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,250
Oh, she's the best.

300
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,250
Oh, where is Cassie?

301
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,416
Uh, uh... Well...

302
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,125
She, um... She's running late.

303
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,458
- She had a...
- Oh.

304
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,666
- A mascara crisis.
- Right.

305
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,250
Mascara? Is everything okay?

306
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,958
- Oh, no, she'll be fine.
- Okay.

307
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:31,916
Oh, listen, are you going

308
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,875
- to the magic shop?
- Yeah.

309
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,291
Can you pass out some of these
campaign flyers for me?

310
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,958
- I would really appreciate it.
- Sure. Yeah.

311
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,666
I'm gonna see you at the festival tonight.
Look at this.

312
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,666
Am I gone a see you here?

313
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,541
Yeah? Okay. It's gonna be a good one.

314
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,666
Can you guess why?

315
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,416
Guess who's coming back from Boston.

316
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,666
Sandy's Candy Cauldron.

317
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,625
What?

318
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,041
You don't remember Sandy's Candy Cauldron?

319
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,541
Oh, come on. She was the best.

320
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,333
And then she got so busy because
she went on something called GMA,

321
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,041
which is like some acronym
for fancy people.

322
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,291
- I don't really get it, but, you know.
- <i>Good Morning America</i>?

323
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,208
But I got her to come back.

324
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,333
And listen. You have to have
one of her caramel apples.

325
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,375
It will... It'll change your life.

326
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,708
Promise me?

327
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,958
- Totally.
- Yeah, absolutely.

328
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,125
Good. Oh, would you mind
just taking the rest of these?

329
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,166
- Sure. Of course.
- Thanks, guys.

330
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,500
All right. Later, Mr. Traske.

331
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,625
- See you guys later.
- See you.

332
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,125
- He really is the nicest man alive.
- I know.

333
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,833
It's kind of sad he doesn't realize
Cassie kicked us to the curb.

334
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,583
People of Salem, gather round.

335
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,458
I am Gilbert the Great,

336
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,250
here to terrify and amaze you

337
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:41,708
with the most bone-chilling legend
of All Hallow's Eve.

338
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,166
That of the Sanderson Sisters.

339
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,541
The Sanderson Sisters
were the most powerful coven

340
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,875
that ever lived,

341
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,750
thanks to Winifred's book of spells.

342
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,208
You really don't want people
opening that book, huh?

343
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,916
That's not to keep people from getting in.

344
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,833
No, it's to keep the book
from getting out.

345
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,916
Oh.

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,875
That very book contains
the recipe to the potion

347
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,791
the sisters used to kill Emily Binx

348
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,833
<i>on Halloween night, 1693.</i>

349
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,750
<i>In that same night,
the three witches hanged.</i>

350
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,791
<i>But not before they cast the curse!</i>

351
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,125
Ah! Fools. All of you.

352
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:40,666
<i>That if a virgin should light the Black
Flame Candle on All Hallow's Eve</i>

353
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,208
with a full moon in the sky,

354
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,666
the Sanderson Sisters vowed
they would one day return

355
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,375
to take revenge on all of Salem.

356
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,958
What's a virgin?

357
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:59,125
Uh, that is a... a person who has never...

358
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,833
lit a candle.

359
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,833
But perhaps the sisters
have already returned.

360
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,750
Twenty-nine years ago, on Halloween night,

361
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,416
some swear they saw three figures fly
across the moon.

362
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,000
Sounds like someone
had a little too much candy.

363
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:22,125
Well, then, how do you explain this?

364
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,666
Behold, the Black Flame Candle
burned to the wick.

365
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,333
Oh, so the witches have been walking
among us for 29 years.

366
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,458
- Look out, everybody.
- No, man.

367
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,833
The candle's magic only brings
them back for one night.

368
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,875
They disappear at sunrise. Okay?

369
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,875
Just, can I finish this?

370
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,125
Thank you.

371
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,291
But if the candle's melted,
then no one can light it

372
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,583
and they can't come back.

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,541
- Right?
- You are right.

374
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,458
- They cannot return.
- Mm-hm.

375
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,625
That is unless there is another candle.

376
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,416
Witches are real. We're all gonna die.

377
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,083
And if you two would like
to try your hand

378
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,958
at resurrecting the Sanderson Sisters,

379
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,375
Black Flame candles
are half off for Halloween.

380
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,875
So.

381
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,750
What can I get for my favorite customers?

382
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,833
Uh...

383
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,458
- Just this.
- What? That's it?

384
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,958
But it's your birthday.

385
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,375
You can't just come in here
for one crystal like it's any old Tuesday.

386
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,375
You know, legend has it,

387
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,875
it's on the 16th birthday
that a witch gets her powers.

388
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,125
And like most legends,
I'm assuming that's based on

389
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,125
some sort of patriarchal fear
of female aging.

390
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,041
Yeah, probably that too.

391
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,000
But either way,

392
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,500
- I have a gift for your empowerment.
- Ooh.

393
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,666
Just the thing
for a young mystic.

394
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,750
Ew.

395
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:51,791
- It looks like it drowned.
- Well, looks aren't everything.

396
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:56,333
Besides, I charged that candle
with a very powerful magic just for you.

397
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,958
It's perfect for your birthday ritual.

398
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,541
It's on the house.

399
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,833
And speaking of trollies...

400
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,625
You know, if you're looking to kill
some time before your birthday plans...

401
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,916
We're not doing the ghost tour.

402
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,333
- Oh, well...
- I'm sorry.

403
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,208
It's just we basically know it by heart.

404
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,000
Ooh. Free stuff. What are these?

405
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,833
Angelica leaves.
You burn them to lift curses.

406
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,333
You should take some.

407
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,125
For you never know
when you may be cursed on Halloween.

408
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,375
- Hey.
- Take it off.

409
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,708
- You don't taunt the Devil Book.
- Stop. Stop, Amanda.

410
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,708
You know,
I still don't get why you chose

411
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,791
the creepiest part of the woods
to have a ritual.

412
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,416
I just kind of feel drawn to it.

413
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,958
And besides, it's nice to be
in the comfort of nature.

414
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,458
The park behind my house
has great nature too.

415
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,166
But you know who did? Glenn.

416
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,583
- He is a phenomenal dancer.
- Phenomenal dancer.

417
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,666
Yes, exactly.
It's really, really beautiful.

418
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,166
Uh-huh.

419
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,083
My mom is shopping
for snacks for the movie marathon,

420
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,458
and she keeps sending
me blurry pictures of cookies.

421
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,916
She's just trying to help.

422
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,416
I know, but it's just, like,

423
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,083
"Buy the cookies, Susan. Who cares?"

424
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,208
What?

425
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,166
Felt like we needed her here with us.

426
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,666
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

427
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,166
All right.

428
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,708
-Another year begins anew,
-Another year begins anew,

429
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,250
- Maiden, Mother, and Crone too.
- Maiden, Mother, and Crone too.

430
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,875
-We call on thee with one request,
-We call on thee with one request,

431
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,958
- help our intentions manifest.
- Help our intentions manifest.

432
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,916
It won't go out.

433
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:57,583
- Becca.
- Hang on.

434
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,791
Thanks a lot, Gilbert.

435
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,083
Almost started a forest fire.

436
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,708
Oh, okay.

437
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,583
Okay.

438
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,833
What the...

439
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,666
How, how is that?

440
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,458
Izzy?

441
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,041
Becca.

442
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,708
Why is everything so quiet?

443
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,208
I don't know.

444
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,666
Um...

445
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,541
What is that? What is that?
Why is everything... What...

446
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,750
- Here we go.
- What, what is happening?

447
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,083
- Here we go.
- Izzy!

448
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,708
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

449
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,458
Nope.

450
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,750
Go, go, go!

451
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,916
- Are you still here?
- Yeah, yeah.

452
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,791
Wasn't there a moon?

453
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,208
- What's... What's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know.

454
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,166
- It's lightning. It's lightning.
- It's lightning.

455
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,458
It's lightning, right? Yeah.

456
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,708
- It's lightning. It's lightning.
- Yeah.

457
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,916
Lock up your children.

458
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,833
Yes, Salem. We're back.

459
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,625
Are those the Sanderson Sisters?

460
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,666
We're back.
We're back. We're back.

461
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,833
- What do we do? What do we do?
- I don't know.

462
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,500
But I literally can't stop watching them.

463
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:34,125
Izzy, snap out of it.

464
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,208
How is this happening?

465
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,916
Candle. Virgin. Moon.

466
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,125
- Run!
- Run!

467
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,000
- Watch out.
- All together now, girls.

468
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,625
Who are they performing for?

469
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:01,583
You.

470
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,750
Hello.

471
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,083
- Oh, well, well, well.
- Hi.

472
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,916
Good work, sisters.

473
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,958
How convenient.
Two little mortals ripe for picking.

474
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,125
Come, sisters.

475
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,375
If we intend to live past sunrise,

476
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,708
we have to brew the life potion
and steal their souls.

477
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:28,916
Book!

478
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,916
Where, oh, where is his beacon of light?

479
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,250
Have I been forsaken?

480
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,833
- I cannot steal their souls without him.
- Boo.

481
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,958
- Sister Mary, help me. Help me.
- Yes.

482
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:49,083
- Yes, yes, yes, Sister Winifred.
- Bop.

483
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,166
- No.
- Very good.

484
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,666
Where was he last seen?

485
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,916
- Retrace our steps.
- Okay.

486
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,250
Oh, okay. Oh, I got it.

487
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,333
If my memory serves me incorrectly,
we were in the cottage.

488
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:01,416
The boys were in the cages
and that's when that sunrise tricked us.

489
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,416
Fake sunrise.

490
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,166
This time there will be no trickery.

491
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,291
- No way.
- No trickery.

492
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,625
If we see a teenager, we will kill it.

493
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes!

494
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,666
Wait, wait.
We're not, we're not teenagers.

495
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,416
- No.
- We only look young, but,

496
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,750
but really, we're... 40.

497
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:19,666
Forty?

498
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,083
- Oh, 40?
- Old folks, huh?

499
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,333
- Very fine position.
- You must say.

500
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,416
- I think it's the quality...
- They're aged.

501
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,416
- Of their complexion and skin.
- Yeah.

502
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,250
Yeah. I mean,
we eat young souls all the time.

503
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,750
That's... we're just like you guys.
That's why we brought you back.

504
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,125
You are our idols.

505
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,708
- Idols?
- Really?

506
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,416
- My favorite word. Thou dost worship us?
- Sayeth more.

507
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,291
Of course.

508
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,166
Which one do you like the best?

509
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,083
Don't say, don't say.

510
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,791
- I know, I know, I know.
- Get in line. Get in line.

511
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,375
And great news.

512
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,875
You don't even have to brew
the potions anymore.

513
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:50,791
You could just buy them.

514
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:51,708
Yeah.

515
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,625
Buy them?

516
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:53,833
- Buy them?
- Imagine.

517
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,750
Yes, we have a whole youth
and beauty industry,

518
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,916
you know, shops where you can go buy
all sorts of serums and lotions.

519
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,208
- Lotions?
- Lo...

520
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,458
Oh, lotions. Like potions.

521
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,375
Potion.

522
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,291
Yup, yup. Just like potions.

523
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,333
Except better,
because the souls are already mixed in.

524
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,916
No more luring children to their demise?

525
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,791
- No. They're already demised.
- No.

526
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,916
Oh, that's a great time hack.
Thank you kindly.

527
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,166
I delighted in the luring.

528
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,458
'Twas was my only job.

529
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,375
- Alas.
- Alas.

530
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,125
- Oh, yes.
- Sisters, let us confabulate.

531
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,750
Oh, confabulate, confabulate.

532
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,041
- The apothecary, apothecary, apothecary?
- Bottles and bottles of it. Yeah.

533
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,583
- And break.
- And break.

534
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,166
Lead us to thine apothecary.

535
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,208
- Now.
- Toot suite.

536
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

537
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,291
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

538
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,375
'Tis powerful indeed.

539
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,458
Look. Observe, sisters.

540
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,541
It glows from within
with a sickening light.

541
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,916
Yeah. Yeah, that's fluorescents for you.

542
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,000
- Fluorescents?
- Yes.

543
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,416
- You know, I think we knew her.
- Yes.

544
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,333
I think she was in the Paris coven.

545
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:12,333
- Oh, she was fierceful.
- Oh, my. Such a lie.

546
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,833
Oh, Winnie, the gates,
they parted for her.

547
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:21,125
Oh. She must be very powerful.

548
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,500
Well, so am I.

549
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,708
Of course, Winnie.

550
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,333
Oh, careful.

551
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,458
Oh.

552
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,666
Did you see? Look at that.

553
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,416
- I'm just gonna...
- Go do it. Okay. I'll give it a try.

554
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,541
Oh.

555
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,958
Beautiful.

556
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,083
- Look at it. This isn't an apothecary.
- Look, the Queen.

557
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,500
This doesn't look a thing

558
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,416
- like father's apothecary.
- It is bright.

559
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,791
Like the moon.

560
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,333
- It's not your mother's apothecary.
- Where are the brats?

561
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:58,708
And it is enormous.

562
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,416
All right, so children's souls.

563
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,791
- Children's souls.
- Oh, yes.

564
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,666
- Children's souls.
- That would be aisle four.

565
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,125
- Aisle? What's an aisle?
- Aisle.

566
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,583
- Aisle? Aisle, aisle?
- MARY, SARAH: Aisle? Aisle?

567
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,458
- No, what's thee saying?
- I'll flay thee alive.

568
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:10,375
Where are the potions?

569
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,083
You look at the numbers in the sky.

570
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,083
- Oh, in the sky.
- Oh, there.

571
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,125
No, you fool.

572
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,125
She means the sign.

573
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:20,375
They beckon thee. Sisters.

574
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,291
Yes. We're right behind you.

575
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,625
Just, uh, look for anything
that says youth.

576
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,291
Youth. Youth. Youth.

577
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,250
Youth. Youth. Youth. Youth. Youth.

578
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,291
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

579
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,375
Boo!

580
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,708
I love that. It works every time.

581
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:42,250
So where on earth are you two
delicious morsels going, huh?

582
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,458
- Nowhere.
- No, no, no. Not running away.

583
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,791
Uh, we're just giving you some space.

584
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,166
Oh, no, I don't like space.

585
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,208
Oh, come on, my friends, let's get closer.

586
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,666
Closer, right?

587
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,875
So I can be close enough
just in case I decide to eat you.

588
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,000
Soup's on.

589
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,250
Shall we?

590
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,083
Oh, dinner for three.

591
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,583
- Good.
- Delicious.

592
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:20,333
Floral with a woodsy finish.

593
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,916
Tastes tinkly.

594
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,541
My favorite feeling.

595
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,250
That means it's working.

596
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Look. 'Tis the face of a child.

597
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,500
A newborn.

598
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,708
Oh, sister.
What does it taste like?

599
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,166
Raspberry.

600
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,208
- Can I have a bite of the face, please?
- Please, help thee self.

601
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,958
- Poor baby.
- Should we tell them?

602
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:42,958
No.

603
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,500
Oh, "Retinol".

604
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,291
What a charming name for a child.

605
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,208
- Okay, we should get some salt.
- Oh, little Retinol.

606
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,541
Why? So we taste better when they eat us?

607
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,291
No, because it protects
against dark magic.

608
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,666
At least, that's what Gilbert says
to get people to buy it.

609
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,541
Gilbert? Really?

610
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,791
Are you the Sanderson Sisters?

611
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,166
- Perfect. Okay, now, go, go.
- Okay, okay.

612
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,791
Art thee?

613
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,250
We're obsessed with those looks.

614
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,166
Can we take a photo?

615
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,416
- Photo? Photo? We eat thy lives.
- Photo? I don't...

616
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,875
- It's a drawing.
- Yes.

617
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:24,041
- What are we going to do?
- Oh, very close now.

618
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,750
- So good.
- So good.

619
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:31,416
Look at that. We are ravishing.

620
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,666
- We are very...
- Fetching.

621
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,458
- Fetching, fetching.
- Foxy.

622
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,375
- Foxy.
- Foxy.

623
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:37,833
Yeah, see? The lotions work.

624
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:40,416
Why are these children dressed like us?

625
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,583
Oh, because they also worship you.

626
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,916
Of course.

627
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,750
- Yeah.
- Thank thee.

628
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,541
Although all thy flattery
will not save thee

629
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,083
when it comes time for me
to fricassee you.

630
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,291
Uh-oh. Winnie.

631
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:04,791
The... The little box lied.

632
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,500
How many children's souls
are in those potions?

633
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,166
- Who?
- How many souls?

634
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,750
Zero?

635
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,041
La.

636
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,750
- Teenager.
- No, no.

637
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,625
He's just confused.
Don't listen to him, okay?

638
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,041
Look, trust me. You look amazing.

639
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,333
The potions work.
It's just, it's just bad lighting.

640
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,166
Curse the lighting.

641
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,791
- Whoa, is that serious?
- Oh-oh.

642
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,625
That's not good. Okay, okay, okay.

643
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:33,750
Where are you?

644
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,250
And curse thee.

645
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,375
Yeah!

646
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,375
- Are you okay? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

647
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,875
I didn't know what to grab.
I just grabbed everything.

648
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,416
Oh, there they are.

649
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Say hello to Satan for me.

650
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,291
Oh!

651
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,750
- Salt can do that?
- Do it.

652
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,583
Oh, my God.
We gotta get out of here.

653
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,750
- Holy Lucifer, how did she do that?
- What the...

654
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,166
What care I.

655
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,708
We need my Book.

656
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:08,916
We must brew the life potion
or our fate will be sealed at sunrise.

657
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,041
- Sunrise again.
- Again.

658
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,541
Oh, Mary. I cannot take another minute.

659
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,833
- You wanna hit me?
- No. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

660
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,791
We already drank the life potion.

661
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,625
Simpleton. Those were a hoax.

662
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,041
- We're wasting time. We must fly.
- Fly.

663
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:25,958
On what?

664
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:31,041
Just like my old one.

665
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,083
Oh, well, What about us?

666
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,250
There's only one.

667
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,375
Bats and beetles,
find something, anything.

668
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,041
We must fly.

669
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:45,625
Winnie, my broomies are misbehaving.

670
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,750
Uh-oh. Winnie, I'm surfing.

671
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,791
Cowabunga.

672
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,583
Winnie.

673
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,958
What unholy dance art thou doing?

674
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,666
I don't know.
They were the only broomies left.

675
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,958
The man said,

676
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,875
“Be careful,
they have a mind of their own.”

677
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,041
He's right.

678
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,541
Stop it. Sit.

679
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,000
Sisters, focus.

680
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:12,791
We must fly to our ancestral cottage,
get Book, and brew our potion.

681
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,875
And then, what, Winnie?

682
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,625
- Then, what?
- Then we run amok in Salem.

683
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,041
Stop that.

684
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:24,625
Don't make me come over
there with this broom.

685
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,791
Gilbert. Where did you get that candle?

686
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,083
We have to get the book out to here.

687
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,250
The witches will be here any second.

688
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,250
The... The book is alive.

689
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,166
He woke up?

690
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,333
Hey, buddy.

691
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,458
You guys know each other?

692
00:38:58,583 --> 00:38:59,541
Ah.

693
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,291
Hey. Remember me?

694
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,791
Yeah, it's Gilbert.

695
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:05,625
Gilbert the Great because,
yeah, I've earned the title now

696
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,208
with my knowledge of magical
and the occult, but...

697
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,416
Uh-huh. Yeah.

698
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh, my goodness.

699
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,708
It's so incredible. I can't believe this.

700
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,666
- I can't believe it worked.
- Shut it.

701
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,333
- What were they like?
- No, what do you mean "it worked?"

702
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,000
Did they sing?
Because, you know, they love to sing.

703
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,916
Wait, you knew
that was a Black Flame Candle?

704
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,708
Look, I am so sorry
I had to trick you, but...

705
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,208
I mean, I couldn't light
the candle myself.

706
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,916
- It just it wouldn't have worked.
- Well, why not?

707
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,333
Oh, ew.

708
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,541
Why would you do this?

709
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,583
They're evil.

710
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,625
Well, only because they had to be.

711
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:45,958
You know, they were ahead of their time
and they were misunderstood.

712
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,833
Then, the whole world was against them.

713
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,958
But now, look, everybody loves them.
Look at all this stuff.

714
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,125
- Oh, my God.
- At last.

715
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:57,791
Back to our squall and verminous abode.

716
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,541
Home sweet.

717
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,500
No.

718
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:07,125
Where are all the cobwebs...
and my rat tails?

719
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,833
Uh-oh. Winnie, hold me.

720
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:13,000
Oh, it no longer smells like death.

721
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,333
Now, it smells like...

722
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,041
Clean linen.

723
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,083
Yeah, we have a plug-in for that.

724
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,625
A boy.

725
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:24,791
Hi, I'm Gilbert the Great
and I am your biggest fan.

726
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,250
My Book.

727
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,250
Oh.

728
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,083
- Oh, my darling, they hurt you.
- Is he okay?

729
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,166
- Did he break anything?
- Oh, goodness, gracious.

730
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,291
Oh, my darling. Oh.

731
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,208
I've missed thee.

732
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,291
My beautiful Book.
How's your eye?

733
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,916
- Where are my lucky rat tails?
- Uh-oh.

734
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,833
Winnie, look, I found
the two 40-year-old teenagers.

735
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,958
- Oh, Winnie, can we kill them now?
- All in good time.

736
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,375
A quick death will be too kind
for these two.

737
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,166
Here. Hold my darling.

738
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,333
- And don't drop it like you just did.
- Thank you.

739
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,708
Throw them in the dungeon.

740
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,625
- My pleasure.
- Dungeon?

741
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Bye-bye.

742
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,458
Ah, good work, Mary.

743
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:15,625
- Uh, whoa. Wait. Can we talk about this?
- No.

744
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:24,458
None shall see or hear thee shout,
heed my words there's no way out.

745
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,958
That's a big ole yikes.

746
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,333
- No, you haven't.
- Oh, sisters,

747
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,750
haven't lost my touch.

748
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,000
- No, Winnie.
- You know,

749
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,750
whatever those two may have done,
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

750
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,041
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

751
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,250
Um, maybe we can through there's windows.

752
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,791
- Window, window. Window.
- Window, window.

753
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,875
- No. Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

754
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,416
Yeah, I've been trying to bring you back
ever since I saw you that night.

755
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,541
That night?

756
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,625
Hm.

757
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,375
What night?

758
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,791
Halloween, 1993.

759
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,708
<i>Not a great year for me.</i>

760
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,458
<i>Bunch of boys stole all my candy.</i>

761
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:12,416
<i>But then...</i>

762
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,791
<i>...I saw you.</i>

763
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,791
<i>I chased you all the way to the cemetery.</i>

764
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,708
Goodbye.

765
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,541
- Wha...
- Bye-bye.

766
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,958
<i>But I was too late.</i>

767
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:30,250
Oh, my. You're very close. Yeah.

768
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,958
Oh. Ma'am, so I, I, you know,
I want to know for sure.

769
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:36,666
So I went to see if the candle
was lit and I found Book.

770
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,125
He was awake.

771
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,958
He showed me how to make another candle.

772
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,833
- I mean, it wasn't pretty but...
- Oh, my beloved Book.

773
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:48,916
I knew thou wouldst have a plan
to bring Mommy back.

774
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,833
La, la, la. And now, at long last,
it is time to conjure together once more.

775
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:58,208
And what are we conjuring, exactly?
Perhaps something fun.

776
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,375
- Maybe another...
- Silence.

777
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,166
Uh-oh. Winnie...

778
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:02,625
What is it?

779
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,041
Tis the Reverend.

780
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,208
- He... He's alive?
- Of course, not you ninny.

781
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,833
Must be a descendant.

782
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,916
- Who is this man?
- Oh, that's the mayor.

783
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,375
Incomprehensible.

784
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:22,000
Three hundred years later
and the dark cloud of Traske

785
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,500
still looms over Salem.

786
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:26,333
Mm, I told you we should have...

787
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:28,583
...the entire family
when we had the chance.

788
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:31,791
We tried, but we were too young
and too weak.

789
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:35,166
Mother said one day,
witches would rule Salem.

790
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,416
And what have we done instead?

791
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,291
Die?

792
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,458
Oh, no, no, no, Winnie. Oh, oh, come back.

793
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,208
Come back to mommy.
You're getting very worked up.

794
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,333
- Deep breaths.
- You know, perhaps

795
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,541
maybe like a calming circle might...

796
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,666
- How'd you know about that?
- I read Reverend Traske's journals.

797
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,750
- He wrote all about you.
- All nice things, I hope.

798
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,458
- Not really.
- You know, just spit balling here,

799
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,041
- but maybe we could make a life potion?
- Wouldn't he?

800
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,833
- I'm done with piddling potions.
- Okay.

801
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,833
If we were the most powerful witches
on Earth, nothing can stop us.

802
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:06,125
Not teenagers, not Traskes,
not the infernal sun.

803
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:09,333
Sisters, it has been decided.

804
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:13,250
We are doing the Magicae Maxim a.

805
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,750
The Power Spell.

806
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,666
Oh, but Winnie, you promised
you'd never, ever do that spell.

807
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,166
That was 300 years ago.
That promise has expired.

808
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,333
- Expired. Oh, that makes sense to me.
- Guess you switched your lane.

809
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,291
You got it.

810
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,500
- I don't think he cares for that spell.
- Yeah, I think she's right.

811
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,625
- Maybe we should give him a minute...
- The book has opinions?

812
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,125
- ...to come around to it.
- Careful.

813
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,916
Oh, oh, no. No, not your teeth.

814
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,208
- They're your calling card.
- Help me out here, Mary.

815
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,416
I still have mixed feelings
about helping you.

816
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,375
- Just, it's a spell that I won't...
- Unhand me, you idiot.

817
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,500
I'm sorry.

818
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,541
What is happening?

819
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,291
Resistance is futile.

820
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,500
Show me the Power Spell.

821
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,875
Now, the Power Spell.

822
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:08,250
"Beware the Power Spell
for it is most dangerous,"

823
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,041
Oh, fie, we have no time for warnings.

824
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,041
Ah!

825
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,041
At last.

826
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,916
Oh, by Lucifer's hangnail.

827
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,250
The incantation
has to be recited seven times.

828
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,333
Don't you hate those?

829
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,583
I mean, one flub and thou
must start all over again.

830
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:22,500
It's, like, you're getting in the groove,

831
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,708
- and then what? I know.
- Right? Like, who has that kind of time?

832
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:28,875
"Must be done is a sacred pla..."
Oh, a sacred place.

833
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,625
We are not allowed in those.

834
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,125
Not one of their sacred places,
you nitwit.

835
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,750
- One of ours.
- Ours.

836
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,666
- One of ours.
- The Forbidden Wood.

837
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,625
That's our spot.

838
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:41,291
- It's sacred?
- Let's see,

839
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,416
what else do we need?

840
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:44,166
The head of a lover.

841
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,291
Oh, yeah, that'd be a bummer,
because all of our lovers are gone.

842
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:53,833
Oh, but we could find new ones.

843
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,750
Nonsense. We'll simply dig up
my old lover, Billy Butcher son.

844
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:01,458
Okay, sure.
But you know, Billy was my lover.

845
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:04,375
Oh, Sarah. You were just a fling.
Let's see, what else?

846
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,791
- Witch's butter...
- Butter.

847
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,375
- ...juice of an Aralia berry...
- Berry.

848
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:13,125
- ...one petrified spider, and...
- Oh, one drop of thy enemy's blood.

849
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:16,375
God, don't you love it
when the recipe requires blood?

850
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,416
That reminds me. Gilbert?

851
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,125
- Uh-huh.
- Does thou have the Sanderson hourglass?

852
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,375
Um...

853
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,708
Psssst. Um...

854
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,958
You... No, actually, no.

855
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,166
- I don't, I don't think I do.
- Awkward.

856
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,291
No problem at all.

857
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,666
And since you don't have it,
we'll just have to kill thee.

858
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,416
Oh, you said "hourglass" with an "H".
Yes, that I do have, actually.

859
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,041
Yeah, I think I misheard you
when you said it before,

860
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,583
I thought that you and I...

861
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,416
The Binx boy, he lives?

862
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,583
That's just Cobweb. He's my cat.

863
00:46:54,666 --> 00:47:00,291
- I know 'tis really thee, Thackery.
- Die. Die, wretched feline.

864
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,666
No, no, no, don't kill him.

865
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,041
I have your hourglass.

866
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,750
The glass...

867
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:14,916
Now do for me what I ask,
thy life depends upon this task.

868
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,375
Oh.

869
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:21,416
- What was that?
- Let's call it a binding contract.

870
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,166
You shall gather all the ingredients
and bring them to the Forbidden Wood.

871
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,625
And we shall sniff out the blood
of our enemy.

872
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,875
- The Reverend.
- The Mayor.

873
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:32,166
The Reverend Mayor.

874
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,541
And if you fail, you forfeit your life...

875
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:40,375
with the last grain of this sand.

876
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:43,333
Uh...

877
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:48,291
- Best of luck, Gilbert.
- Oh, and Wilbert, I made thee a list.

878
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,458
Thy life depends upon it.

879
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:53,291
Oh, you just had to keep
that hourglass, didn't you?

880
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:58,041
Now, wait here while
I go to find that wretched Traske.

881
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:03,041
And darling, be sure to come
to me when I call.

882
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:08,958
Sisters, come along.
The Mayor's blood awaits.

883
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,208
Oh, my God.
They're going to kill Mr. Traske.

884
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,291
Once they do that Power Spell,
I think they're going to kill everybody.

885
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,833
Okay. Not to freak out, but the idea

886
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,166
of a vengeful maniac obsessed
with getting revenge on Salem

887
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,625
becoming an invincible, all-powerful,

888
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,750
vengeful maniac obsessed
with getting revenge on Salem

889
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,250
sounds very bad for Salem.

890
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,666
- We have to tell Cassie.
- Okay.

891
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,125
Do you think she'll even answer?

892
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,125
Come on, come on, come on.

893
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:44,166
Hey, Becca?

894
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,333
The Sanderson Sisters are back
and they're coming after your dad.

895
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:47,833
<i>Hey, Becca, I can't hear... Are you there?</i>

896
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:51,166
<i>I think you might be covering your camera.
I can't see you. Are you coming over?</i>

897
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,125
- Hey, babe.
- Hi. Can you go check on that, baby?

898
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,791
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

899
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,041
Becca? Hey, Bec?

900
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,416
She can't hear us.

901
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,875
<i>It's butt-dial. Awesome.</i>

902
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,541
Okay. I guess
the curse covers phones, too.

903
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,291
- I know.
- There's no way out of here.

904
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,333
Yes, there is.

905
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,375
Angelica leaves.

906
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,291
They lift curses.

907
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,583
Hey, if candles can bring back the dead,
why can't potpourri bring back the stairs?

908
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,166
Okay.

909
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:26,583
Head of a lover.

910
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,375
How am I going to dig up
a full grave in time?

911
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,583
I am so dead.

912
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,375
Ah.

913
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,250
That's not six feet under.

914
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,541
Who are you?

915
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:58,666
- Zombie. Killer zombie.
- No. Hey, stop. I am a good zombie.

916
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,083
- I'm not even chasing thee.
- Stay back.

917
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,833
And don't try to eat my brains.

918
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,416
Why would I...

919
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,333
I simply wish to know
why you were digging up me grave.

920
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:13,875
And I simply wish to know
why you're alive.

921
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:17,041
Well, because I was woken up
and never put back to sleep.

922
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,500
Well, I've been awake since...

923
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:22,000
How long ago was 1993?

924
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:26,500
Wait, were you there that night?
With the Sanderson Sisters?

925
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:30,250
- Uh... unfortunately.
- Well, guess what?

926
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,833
They're back again.

927
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:37,375
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, wait.

928
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,666
I need your help.

929
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,125
I'm doing this spell to kill Winifred...

930
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,833
for good.

931
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:47,708
I mean, don't you want to pay
her back for poisoning you

932
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:50,625
and sewing your mouth shut?

933
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:54,000
- Thou knoweth how I die?
- Well, yeah.

934
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:57,291
Everyone knoweth the legend
of Billy Butcher son.

935
00:50:57,666 --> 00:50:59,250
You were Winifred's lover

936
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:00,958
and you cheat on her
with Sarah so she killed you.

937
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,791
What? No, no.

938
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,333
No, no, no. That is not what happened.

939
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:09,791
I shared one kiss with Winifred.

940
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,500
One.

941
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:17,000
Oh, she has sullied my name for eternity.

942
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,166
Well, if you help me gather
everything I need for the spell,

943
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,291
I will tell everyone the truth about you.

944
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,375
Huh?

945
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,666
So what do you say?

946
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,083
Partners?

947
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,750
Mm.

948
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:38,291
Sorry.

949
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:39,458
Um-hm.

950
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:42,333
There we go. Right as rain.

951
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,125
Corn, I smell corn.

952
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,375
- Step lively.
- Wait.

953
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:53,125
- We are looking for the Mayor.
- Oh, yeah.

954
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:55,250
- And here are you.
- Thank you.

955
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:58,875
Have you had these before?

956
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:02,166
Oh, get ready. Get ready.

957
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,166
Oh, my.

958
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,750
Have you seen the Mayor?

959
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:07,791
Have you seen the Mayor?

960
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,708
Come on, get that apple, man!

961
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,875
Yeah! Come on, I got more than this!

962
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,583
- Oh, look.
- Look it, they're drowning a man.

963
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:16,625
How charming.

964
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:19,666
I like this festival.

965
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,208
Oh, look. He has an apple in his mouth.

966
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,666
Perhaps they're going to roast him
on a spit.

967
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,416
Oh, my brooms would love this.

968
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,875
Let me get the girls. Where are the...

969
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,666
- Oh, there they are.
- Oh, sweeties.

970
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,291
- They have a mind of their own.
- What?

971
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,416
Now what?

972
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,500
Poisoned apple.

973
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,541
Poisoned apple.

974
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,250
Poisoned apple.

975
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,291
Would you like a poisoned apple?

976
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,708
Oh, thou must never announce
that they're poisoned, sister.

977
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,916
No one will eat them
if they think they're deadly.

978
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,375
Amateur.

979
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,750
That looks scrumptious.

980
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,541
- Maybe I could just have one big bi...
- No eating until we find the Mayor.

981
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,333
Okay. Sorry.

982
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:27,125
Sarah, come.

983
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,208
- Oh!
- Come.

984
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,833
Uh, maybe we do a hand-waving thing
like the witches do?

985
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:39,875
Lift the curse and let us out.

986
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:41,833
You.

987
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:47,958
- Lift the curse and let us out.
- Lift the curse and let us out.

988
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:51,333
- Lift the curse and let us out.
- Lift the curse and let us out.

989
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:54,041
- Lift the curse and let us out.
- Lift the curse and let us out.

990
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:55,875
- Lift the curse and let us out.
- Lift the curse and let us...

991
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,458
Oh, my Goddess, it worked.

992
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,750
I can't believe it worked.

993
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,708
Oh, I always thought Gilbert
was lying about this stuff.

994
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,833
We need to get Mr. Traske somewhere safe.

995
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,625
We should probably get that book away
from the witches.

996
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:08,583
Okay. I'll call him

997
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:09,875
- and you find the book.
- Got it.

998
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:18,458
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Mr. Traske.</i>

999
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,250
- <i>Um, it's Becca.</i>
- Oh, hey, Becca.

1000
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,000
Sorry to do this, but...

1001
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,791
- Cassie's throwing a party.
- Oh, fun. Where?

1002
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,208
<i>- At your house.</i>
- What?

1003
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:27,250
With boys.

1004
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:30,125
<i>You should get home as soon as possible.</i>

1005
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:34,333
I'm sorry, would you mind saving
my place in line?

1006
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:36,333
My daughter's about to ruin her future.

1007
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,416
Okay. He's safe now.

1008
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,958
Book, book, book. Where would it be?

1009
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,750
Cobweb, you genius.

1010
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,708
I got it. Come on, come on.

1011
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,875
Izzy. No.

1012
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,750
Oh, I'm coming! I'm coming!

1013
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:23,250
Oh, please don't kick me. Don't kick me.

1014
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,708
God, this is so much harder than it looks.

1015
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,583
- I know.
- How is this book so strong?

1016
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:30,833
What is wrong with this book?

1017
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:31,916
I'm slipping. No.

1018
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:35,708
What was that all about?

1019
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,125
They must've put a spell
on the book or something.

1020
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:39,416
Now what?

1021
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:42,041
We need to get to Cassie's
before the witches do.

1022
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,416
- Remember. Stay the course.
- Stay the course.

1023
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,083
Absolutely no more distractions.
Say it after...

1024
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:54,000
Hey, it's the Sanderson Sisters.
All right, looking good.

1025
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,125
I bet you're looking for the stage.

1026
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,000
Always.

1027
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:02,666
And I said, "Sanderson?
You Sanderson, you Burnerson."

1028
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:05,291
I don't get it.

1029
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,583
Ooh, look at this.

1030
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:11,416
One last challenger emerges
in the Sanderson Sisters costume contest.

1031
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,208
Looking good, fellas. Very authentic.

1032
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:15,958
Thank you. Thank you.

1033
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:19,708
If only... If these are all worshippers...

1034
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:22,791
- Then this must be, the altar.
- Yes?

1035
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:25,250
All right, let's give it up for...

1036
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,041
Hey, Winnie, what do you call yourselves?

1037
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,708
The originals.

1038
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:32,541
How original.

1039
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:33,750
All right.

1040
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:36,500
Well, you're pretty late so back it up
with the other finalists.

1041
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,166
- Back it up.
- All right.

1042
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,083
Is that what I look like?

1043
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,625
Darn, girl. We look foxy.

1044
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,583
Ooh. Hello, me. Hello, me.

1045
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:51,625
Hello, me.

1046
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,958
Lose the teeth.

1047
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,000
Mind your business, girl.

1048
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,708
All right, people.

1049
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,541
- Thanks, pilgrim. Howdy.
- Who is that witch?

1050
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,791
You're doing great. We have a winner.

1051
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:06,583
Scary drumroll, please.

1052
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:09,750
Roll the drum.

1053
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:10,916
A roll.

1054
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,208
Oh, roll sounds delicious.

1055
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,291
- Can we go?
- We cannot go.

1056
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:18,791
- We're about to win whatever this is.
- All right, put your hands together for...

1057
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,291
Oh, look surprised.

1058
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:21,791
The Sandersonettes.

1059
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:29,000
- We won. We won. We won.
- Wait.

1060
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,750
What sayeth thou? What sayeth thou?

1061
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:35,500
There's been a grievous error.
Begone. They do not want you here.

1062
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:36,833
See? They despise you.

1063
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:39,708
- Begone, begone.
- So, get it quick. Relax.

1064
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:40,833
Everyone picks...

1065
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,125
- What a witch.
- People of Salem,

1066
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:51,958
- we have come for the blood of thy Mayor.
- They're doing a bit.

1067
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:57,416
- That's right, girls. Take all his blood.
- With pleasure.

1068
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,166
- But where is he?
- Where is he?

1069
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,250
Observe, sisters.

1070
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,958
The villagers do not wish to comply.

1071
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:10,708
- Whatever shall we do?
- Oh, they do...

1072
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,166
We could give them a spell.

1073
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,333
Put them under a spell.

1074
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:14,625
- Bewitch them.
- Bewitch them.

1075
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:17,916
- Mary, what a brilliant idea.
- Bless you, too.

1076
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,416
Clear the altar, all of you.
Clear my stage.

1077
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,916
And you.

1078
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,791
Try to keep up.

1079
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,375
One, two, three, four.

1080
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,291
Sisters.

1081
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,416
Now, lead us Salem. Lead us to thy Mayor.

1082
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:46,750
Why did we think
taking Gilbert's trolley was a good idea?

1083
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,625
It's the fastest way
to get there, okay?

1084
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:52,916
Better all be clean
by the time I get back, young lady.

1085
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,708
I love you.

1086
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:10,750
Hey, guys, why are you going so slow?

1087
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:14,541
Wretched villagers.
Useless even when bewitched.

1088
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,375
- Fan out, find him.
- Find him.

1089
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,208
Find the Mayor.

1090
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:32,291
<i>- Get out of my house! Shove it, Steve.
- Shut up. Gordon's fave...</i>

1091
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,791
Okay. Come on, Cassie.

1092
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:44,125
Oh, my goodness,
if Cassie will just answer her phone.

1093
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,625
Please, please, please, please.

1094
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:02,625
Really?

1095
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,666
Sarah, stop bubbling.

1096
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,666
Come to Billy.

1097
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,750
Look what I found.

1098
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:23,208
Great job, buddy.

1099
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,333
Winnie.

1100
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:50,500
Winnie...

1101
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,000
We... We looked everywhere.

1102
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:59,208
I give up, I'm tired, Winnie.
I need, like, a snack and a stool.

1103
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:03,625
- Oh, we could inquire with someone.
- Inquire who?

1104
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:07,208
Who would be stupid enough
to lead three witches to the Mayor?

1105
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,541
Cassie, open up.

1106
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,708
Crazy witches are trying to kill your dad.

1107
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:13,916
Cassie.

1108
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,375
- What are you guys doing?
- Where's your dad?

1109
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,333
Well, after he grounded me
for the rest of my life

1110
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:21,333
because you ratted me out,

1111
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,333
he went back to the festival
to get his apple.

1112
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,375
Mike?

1113
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:33,875
- I told thee it would work.
- Oh, please.

1114
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,625
It's mere luck we stumbled
upon the village idiot.

1115
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:40,791
- Are they...
- We'll explain but inside now.

1116
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,875
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go.

1117
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,416
Were those the Sanderson Sisters?

1118
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,833
Yeah. You saw them flying, right?
So we don't need to explain that to you.

1119
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,541
- Go, go, go.
- Oh, what is happening?

1120
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:04,291
Traske must be in here someplace.
Spread out.

1121
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,666
Not like that.

1122
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,666
- Be serious.
- Be serious.

1123
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:20,916
<i>- Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.</i>
- Who said that?

1124
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:24,583
Winnie...

1125
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:29,625
There is a small woman trapped
in that box.

1126
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:30,666
- No.
- Yes.

1127
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,250
<i>I still don't understand.</i>

1128
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,625
<i>Is there something else I can do for you?</i>

1129
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:39,708
- Thank you, Sandy. Thank you so much.
- Hey. Hi.

1130
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:41,291
- Huh?
- Hey. Hi.

1131
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:44,583
- Okay.
- Hey. Hi.

1132
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,416
He-he-hey.

1133
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,125
This is a flash mob.
You're in a flash mob.

1134
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,083
I watch these on all the time.

1135
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:55,041
Or YouTube. I love them. I love them.
Come here. Oh, I wish I knew the steps.

1136
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:56,125
Hey.

1137
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,208
- Hey.
- Wow.

1138
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,458
Wow, hey, I got tons of steps, man.

1139
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,291
- I got tons of routines.
- What am I doing here?

1140
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,625
- Are we done? The choreo's out?
- What happened?

1141
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,083
- You guys should get an apple.
- What?

1142
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,750
- That was well do...
- How did this happen?

1143
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:08,541
Hey, where's my apple? Where's... Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1144
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:09,916
Who's got my apple?

1145
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,125
Hey. Sandy. No, no.
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

1146
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:17,791
Let's do it. All right.

1147
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,708
- We're going to win us a spider.
- Yes, we are.

1148
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,375
- Not petrified, but...
- I bet they won't even know

1149
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:24,583
- the difference. Exactly.
- She won't know the difference.

1150
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:27,208
All right, all right, all right.

1151
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,458
Ah! Yeah. Yeah.

1152
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:40,125
Uh, you know, I, I... You can do this.
Just kind of believe in yourself.

1153
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,333
- We'll get it.
- You got it. All right. All right now.

1154
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,958
All in the legs. It's all in the...

1155
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,333
I smell children.

1156
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:17,250
Winnie, lookie.

1157
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,666
Oh, well if it isn't...

1158
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,916
- What's her name again?
- Uh...

1159
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,208
Shishka-baby? Shishka...

1160
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,250
Oh, Edward. Edward.

1161
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,708
How could it possibly be Edward,
you silly woman?

1162
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:30,916
It's Becca.

1163
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,458
Um, Becca.

1164
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:35,666
- Well, goodbye, Becca.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

1165
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,333
You need the juice of an Aralia berry
for your spell, right?

1166
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,375
Well, this is all
the Aralia juice in Salem.

1167
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:47,708
Let me out of here, alive,
or I will pour it out.

1168
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,625
Why art thou such a pest?

1169
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:55,041
Dost thou should die for Salem?

1170
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,041
What has Salem ever done for thee?

1171
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,458
No one in Salem
has ever tried to kill my friends.

1172
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,083
Oh, lay thy burden down.

1173
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,291
'Tis unattractive to hold a grudge.

1174
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,208
Yes.

1175
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,791
You've literally
held a grudge for centuries.

1176
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:09,708
And why not?

1177
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,583
That tyrannical Traske
tried to take my sisters.

1178
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:15,166
- Oh, my beloved sisters.
- We're too frail and weak to die.

1179
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,833
- Now, give me that Aralia ju... Now?
- Now!

1180
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,875
We are under attack!

1181
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,250
- Pandemonionium!
- We are under attack!

1182
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,333
What?

1183
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,333
Kill them, Winnie.

1184
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,625
The salt blocks dark magic.

1185
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:46,208
Seeing as you're basically dark magic
in human form, you're trapped.

1186
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:47,333
Impossible.

1187
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,125
Uh-oh.

1188
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,291
Oh, no, no, no.

1189
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:10,666
Oh, this?

1190
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,500
Oh, no, this is just water.
You've been tricked by teenagers.

1191
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:14,958
Again.

1192
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:20,458
Let, let us bewitch them with song

1193
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:24,166
and we will lure them
into setting us free.

1194
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,625
Good idea, good idea. How about...

1195
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:33,041
I don't feel particularly warmed up yet.

1196
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,583
Stop it!

1197
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:41,541
Next time, do not tell people
we wish to bewitch,

1198
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,500
- that we are about to bewitch them.
- Yes, Winnie.

1199
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,625
Ha!

1200
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,875
She cursed you.

1201
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,916
You're not trying to kill them,
you are helping them.

1202
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,666
You liar.

1203
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,708
No.

1204
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:11,375
No, wait, Billy!

1205
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,041
Please. Stop.

1206
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,458
I need your head.

1207
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,291
Take one of their heads.

1208
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,041
It has to be you. You were her lover.

1209
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:24,125
We shared one kiss.

1210
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,750
Please. Let me explain.

1211
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,625
- Give it to me. I...
- My head.

1212
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:32,958
Oh, not again.

1213
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,791
Stop. Unhand me.

1214
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,541
Don't just stand back. Get him.

1215
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:42,958
Follow the sound of my voice, you dust bag.

1216
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,625
I'm okay, babe.

1217
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,166
I'm gonna go ahead and inference

1218
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:50,333
that you're the one responsible
for the Sanderson Sisters being alive.

1219
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:53,083
Okay. Inference is a noun, not a verb...

1220
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:54,291
Who cares?

1221
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,500
This is why you shouldn't
mess around with that witchery.

1222
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:58,208
Hey, I don't think she did it on purpose.

1223
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,583
You didn't, right?

1224
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,500
Are you kidding me? Of course, I didn't.

1225
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:04,166
Gilbert tricked us
into lighting the candle.

1226
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,291
Gilbert did this?

1227
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,250
Yeah, it's been kind of a crazy night.

1228
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:08,833
Which you would know
if you had been there.

1229
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:11,125
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't exactly feel welcome.

1230
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,708
You know, because you guys iced me out.

1231
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:14,708
Are you... you ditched us.

1232
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:16,083
What are you talking about?

1233
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:20,125
I kept asking you guys to hang out
and you would just flake or not respond.

1234
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:23,500
Because everything you wanted to do
involved Mike and his friends.

1235
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,708
Yeah, it was like you
suddenly had an entourage.

1236
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:28,875
And we couldn't hang out with you
without having to hang out with... them.

1237
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,875
I didn't know you guys
were mad about that.

1238
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,166
How could you not know?

1239
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,583
Because you didn't tell me.

1240
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,375
Cassie, why would we want to hang out
with people that just make fun of us?

1241
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:37,833
I don't make fun of you guys.

1242
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:39,708
Yeah, you call us witches
and say that we're weird.

1243
01:09:39,791 --> 01:09:43,750
Yeah, because you hang out in magic stores
and always carry around colorful rocks.

1244
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:47,083
And I think it's weird,
but I don't make fun of you guys.

1245
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:48,375
Do you hear yourself?

1246
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,125
Okay, pointing out people's differences

1247
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,791
and saying that they're weird
is making fun of them.

1248
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:56,666
Whoa.

1249
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,416
Did you, like, really not know that?

1250
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,791
No. I thought
I was just making conversation.

1251
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:07,916
- I've got so many people to apologize to.
- It's okay.

1252
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,333
- Oh, my God, Dad. Oh, my God, stop!
- Wait, Mr. Traske!

1253
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:15,750
- Mr. Traske, no!
- Give me a second, hold on!

1254
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,291
No, where are you going?

1255
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:23,291
The sun. Oh, no. I don't wanna die.

1256
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:28,583
Oh, oopsy. Sorry, my mistake.
It's just a very small bus.

1257
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,625
You.

1258
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:34,708
Hello.

1259
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:40,708
Sorry. Cassie's party is over.
It's time to go home. Yeah.

1260
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,833
It's an older crowd than I expected.

1261
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,000
Wow.

1262
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,416
You're the Sanderson Sisters, right?

1263
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,708
Incredible costumes.
You guys look amazing.

1264
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:54,750
Oh, sew up your lips,
you pious, pompous dunderhead.

1265
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,625
Okay, we're giving a performance now.

1266
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:58,875
I love the commitment.

1267
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:02,666
I love the resting witch face.

1268
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,500
Do you want me to play along? I'll...

1269
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,208
I can play the Reverend, you know.

1270
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,250
I hate the Sanderson Sisters.

1271
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:12,750
Nah, that wasn't that great.

1272
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,916
By the way,
I'm not being a very good host.

1273
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,750
I haven't even formally introduced myself.

1274
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:18,916
- I'm the Mayor...
- Wait, Dad.

1275
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,583
Ooh.

1276
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:25,958
Another little Traske.

1277
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:29,500
The bloodline continues.

1278
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,250
Who are these women?

1279
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,416
Thy worst nightmare.

1280
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,750
Oh, if only we weren't trapped.

1281
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:38,375
What?

1282
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,958
Seriously, what's going on?

1283
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,458
What a cruel world.

1284
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:45,958
We finally have the blood
on the nary our nostrils,

1285
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:50,125
yet we are trapped in salt,
like a slab of corned beef.

1286
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,541
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Well, it's for your safety.

1287
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:53,458
What do you mean it's for my safety?

1288
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,833
- Stop, stop, stop.
- A cruel world.

1289
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:57,041
- What a cruel world.
- Whatever this is, I'm in no mood.

1290
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,250
I've had an awful day, do you know that?

1291
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,875
God knows what kind of unchaperoned
house party you were throwing in there

1292
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,958
and then I come home to like
the gothic Golden Girls in my garage.

1293
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,125
What the heck?
This has been a very bad Halloween.

1294
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,750
Well, at least you got
your caramel apple, right?

1295
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:11,958
Oh, okay.

1296
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,625
Actually, I didn't,
because after mine was stolen,

1297
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:16,166
I went back and Sandy
had given away all of her apples.

1298
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,958
Which I think is really unprofessional,
right?

1299
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:18,958
So I didn't get an apple,

1300
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,791
so then I went to some Walgreen's
who turned out their lights.

1301
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:25,875
Which makes no sense.
What Walgreen's turns out their lights?

1302
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,791
Okay? But you know what I got?
You know what I got in the dark?

1303
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,458
This pathetic thing, this. Look at this.

1304
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,375
I don't even know
if there's an apple in there.

1305
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:35,583
No, this is probably a caramel
covered matzah ball for all I know.

1306
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:37,541
But, you know what?
I'm gonna eat it and I'm gonna like it.

1307
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:41,333
I feel so bad.

1308
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,416
He's been talking about
that caramel apple for weeks.

1309
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,916
I'm just glad he's safe.

1310
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:48,875
Winnie.

1311
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,583
Winnie, look.

1312
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:56,750
I cannot.

1313
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,416
My eyes have misted over

1314
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,916
with the tragic tears
of a lifetime of failure.

1315
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:07,041
Looky, my broomies.
They hate mess. Do you see this?

1316
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,166
Come to momma. Oh, come on.

1317
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,583
Look at it.

1318
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,250
Look it, see what happens, they love it.

1319
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:15,625
That's right, go ahead, eat it up.
That's right. Yes, right there.

1320
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:17,291
Is your dad mad?

1321
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,583
Very. He wants everyone to leave.

1322
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:20,875
Well, we can hang out here,

1323
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,000
um, watch out
for the Sanderson Sisters until sunrise.

1324
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:25,916
Yeah, I'll tell my mom
we're sleeping over at Cassie's.

1325
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,166
- She'll be so happy. She misses you.
- Aw, Susan.

1326
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,625
Let me go!

1327
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,875
- No!
- No!

1328
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,791
- Stop!
- No!

1329
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,166
No! Let go!

1330
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,958
What was that?

1331
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,291
I don't know.

1332
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:46,916
No, we gotta get Cassie.

1333
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,333
- They're going to the woods.
- Okay.

1334
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,291
Let's go.

1335
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:13,791
Head of a lover,
witch's butter, Aralia berry juice,

1336
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:17,291
and a petrified spider, I guess.

1337
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,416
Well, I did it. I'm not gonna die.

1338
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,458
Oh, they're still gonna kill you.

1339
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,625
Mm.

1340
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,583
Not if I kill them first.

1341
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:38,458
That candle is what's keeping them alive.

1342
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,375
It won't go out
until the sun rises, you dolt.

1343
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,166
Well, there's no need for name-calling.

1344
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:46,333
Cassie?

1345
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:52,000
- Oh, Gilbert. Impeccable timing.
- Hi.

1346
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:54,291
Hello, Billy.

1347
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:55,291
Yes.

1348
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:56,916
Hello, Billy.

1349
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,833
Hello, you withering hag.

1350
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:04,583
Well, if thou hast nothing nice to say...

1351
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:10,208
Good job, Winnie.
Now we have everything we need.

1352
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,541
No. Not everything.

1353
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:13,625
Not everything.

1354
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:16,791
Book!

1355
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:26,541
There you are, my sweet.

1356
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,583
Wait, now you said
you need the blood of an enemy.

1357
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:30,666
But I mean, she's not your enemy.

1358
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:33,375
No. But she has our enemy's blood.

1359
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,083
Ooh. That's gotta hurt.

1360
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,541
Okay, well, looks like
you've got everything you need,

1361
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,166
so I think you just

1362
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,541
- maybe let her go, okay?
- Sit and be comfy.

1363
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:47,000
That's a good idea, Gilbert,
but then, how would we torture her, huh?

1364
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:55,208
Now, thank you
for your assistance, Gilbert.

1365
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:58,500
But thou art now rendered redundant.

1366
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,291
Oh.

1367
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:01,416
Bye-bye.

1368
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:05,000
Should we?

1369
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:07,125
- No. Cassie.
- Cassie.

1370
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:17,625
Reveal the incantation.

1371
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,500
Sisters.

1372
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,625
I call upon this sacred land.

1373
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,625
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1374
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,708
To raise the power in my hand.

1375
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:32,458
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1376
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:34,625
From North, the East, the South, the West.

1377
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,583
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1378
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,375
Give me more than I possess.

1379
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,291
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1380
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,291
Underneath the full moon light.

1381
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,208
Ichita...

1382
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:47,041
I sacrifice my love tonight.

1383
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:49,666
And in return, I ask of thee.

1384
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,708
Magicae Maxim a,

1385
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:54,458
give to me.

1386
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:57,625
I call upon this sacred land.

1387
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,750
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1388
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,166
To raise the power...

1389
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:03,500
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1390
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:06,291
From North, the East, the South, the West.

1391
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:07,583
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1392
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,583
- Give me more than I possess.
- Okay.

1393
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,125
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1394
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,333
Becca?

1395
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:18,916
Hm-mm.

1396
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,416
Oh, my God.

1397
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:22,916
How is it...

1398
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,208
The salt in the Walgreen's,
the leaves in the basement,

1399
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:28,000
Cassie's house, 16th birthday.

1400
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:29,166
You're a witch.

1401
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,166
Doesn't make any sense.

1402
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,375
None of what's happened tonight
makes any sense.

1403
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,250
Okay, look, I'm sorry to have
to rush this very big,

1404
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:38,791
very pivotal moment in your life, but...

1405
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:42,041
do you think we could use your magic
to stop them and save Cassie?

1406
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:45,541
I guess we're gonna find out.

1407
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:47,208
Okay. Go get Cassie.

1408
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,291
Let's do this.

1409
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:49,958
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.
- Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1410
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,750
From North, the South, the East, the West.

1411
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,208
Hey, Winifred!

1412
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:03,833
- Edward is a witch?
- I knew she smelled awful.

1413
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:13,916
This little witch against
the most powerful coven in history.

1414
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,625
Sisters, who do you think is going to win?

1415
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,541
Let me see, could it be us?

1416
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,083
Ouch.

1417
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:24,208
Hey. She's got her own coven, you witch.

1418
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,416
- Mayhem.
- Oh, my hair. Winnie, oh!

1419
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,500
- Oh, we are being attacked.
- Got me in my oh, place.

1420
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,333
Heavens to Murgatroyd.

1421
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:35,458
Ow!

1422
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:37,500
- Stop it.
- Kill 'em, Winnie. Kill them.

1423
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:45,958
I...

1424
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:51,750
I am suddenly powerful.

1425
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,000
Look, Winnie. Me too.

1426
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:59,875
I, myself, am suddenly powerful.

1427
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,125
Look it.

1428
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,250
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

1429
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,166
Ow.

1430
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:08,250
- Look at me.
- Get out of here, go.

1431
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,416
Stop. Stop that.

1432
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,333
Stop dancing around, you fools.
Get them, get them.

1433
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:24,000
I beg your pardon?

1434
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,958
I am not a fool.

1435
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:32,125
I am a good and loyal sister,
and I expect to be seen as such.

1436
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:35,250
Ooh, she laid it down.

1437
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:38,416
- She's a good and loyal sister and she...
- Shut up and get going!

1438
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,875
Of course, Winnie. With pleasure.

1439
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,666
- Go, go, go!
- Posthaste! As is your wanting.

1440
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,500
I apologize for her. She can be...

1441
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:45,833
Don't get up.

1442
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,625
You don't want to do this spell.

1443
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:58,708
I know it may not feel like it,
but, you have a choice.

1444
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:01,333
And what choice would that be?

1445
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm talking to the book.

1446
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,416
Book?

1447
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,250
No, no, no!

1448
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:31,041
- Sisters!
- There she is.

1449
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:33,583
Hi. Oh, Becca. You're okay.

1450
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:35,291
I am so sorry.
I should have just told you.

1451
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,958
No, I'm so sorry,
I shouldn't have assumed.

1452
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,375
- You're my best friend.
- No, no, no, but I was the one...

1453
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,125
This is so sweet and I'm so happy
this is happening right now,

1454
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:41,416
but can we please figure out a plan?

1455
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,333
- Right.
- Right.

1456
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,250
Okay. Is there anything that we can do?

1457
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,125
Uh, Magicae Maxim a.

1458
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,166
No, no, no.
I'm not, I'm not like Winifred.

1459
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:55,041
I don't, I don't want to be all-powerful.
I just want to stop them, okay?

1460
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:57,458
I think it wants you to read the warning.

1461
01:20:58,166 --> 01:20:59,875
Oh, the book is alive, by the way.

1462
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:02,375
Oh.

1463
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:05,083
"Beware the Power Spell
for it is most dangerous.

1464
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,541
Power is meant to be shared.

1465
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:10,000
To claim it all, a price must be paid.

1466
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,916
What is valued most dearly,
thou shall have to trade."

1467
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,291
What does she value most?

1468
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,625
Look out!

1469
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:35,583
Oh, sisters, observe.
She has a new parlor trick.

1470
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,291
Shall we have a little fun?

1471
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,958
- Oh, I love fun.
- Like this.

1472
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,333
Uh-huh.

1473
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:52,583
Power's meant to be shared.
Becca, give me your hand.

1474
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:54,125
I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now.

1475
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:58,166
Little witch,
you cannot hide from our power.

1476
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,833
Power is meant to be shared.

1477
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,000
Becca, give me your hand. Come on.

1478
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,583
- Cassie, come on.
- Back up!

1479
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:23,333
Even with your sisters just as powerful
as you are, you still can't win.

1480
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,375
This is my spell.

1481
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:28,791
They are mere parasites,
leeches enjoying the spoils.

1482
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:32,000
I remain the most powerful one.

1483
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:35,750
You couldn't even finish the Power Spell.
And now it's too late.

1484
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:36,916
We have your Book.

1485
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:43,500
I do not need a book.

1486
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:47,458
Sisters, come,
we will complete the spell without Book.

1487
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:50,291
And once we do,
your inconsequential powers

1488
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:52,291
will not protect you
or your little friends

1489
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:55,333
or all of Salem from our wrath.

1490
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:58,833
- Sisters, away.
- Away.

1491
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:02,125
I'm sorry.

1492
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:08,083
Did we... Did we just do magic?

1493
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:17,041
Wait, the warning.
I think I know how to stop them.

1494
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:19,541
- We have to tell them.
- Okay.

1495
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,541
Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1496
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:26,791
Itchita cop it a, melaka mystica.

1497
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:27,958
Sisters.

1498
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,583
It's time.

1499
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,208
The final incantation.

1500
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:39,666
I call upon this sacred land.

1501
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:43,000
To raise the power in my hand.

1502
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:45,416
From North, South, East, and West.

1503
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,791
Come on, we've got to stop them
before it's too late.

1504
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:49,750
- Slow down, guys.
- Come on, Cassie.

1505
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:55,666
Underneath this full moon light,
I sacrifice my love tonight.

1506
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,791
And in return, I ask of thee.

1507
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:04,875
Magicae Maxim a, give to me!

1508
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,041
The candle. Sisters.

1509
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,666
The flame is out and yet...

1510
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:36,083
we are, still here.

1511
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,291
Good work, Winnie. Really.
I mean stellar work.

1512
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,083
- That's something else.
- Yes, beautiful work, Winnie.

1513
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:44,875
- Oh, I thank thee. I thank thee, sisters.
- This one.

1514
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,625
- Like...
- And now, we shall never die.

1515
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,500
And all Salem shall pay!

1516
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:05,041
Madam, come here often?

1517
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:07,125
- May I?
- Delighted.

1518
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,500
Oh, look.

1519
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,500
Well, well, well.

1520
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:29,750
The little witch returns with her lackeys.
What dost thou want here?

1521
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,250
You should've read the warning.

1522
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:34,375
Why? What pearls
wouldst Book cast at my feet?

1523
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,750
I read none.

1524
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,416
The Power Spell?

1525
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:41,666
It takes what you value most.

1526
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:43,083
- Silence.
- Winnie.

1527
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:46,500
Thou aren't no witch.
Thou art nothing but a silly child.

1528
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:48,791
Thou knowest nothing.

1529
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:49,958
Winnie.

1530
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:54,500
Winnie?

1531
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:57,916
- No.
- The wind...

1532
01:25:58,583 --> 01:26:00,375
is stealing my fingers.

1533
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,500
- Winnie.
- Sisters.

1534
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:09,916
'Tis over? Oh, no.

1535
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Oh, Winnie, please.
Please don't, please don't forget us.

1536
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:17,958
Oh, and I know,
I know I was your favorite.

1537
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:22,375
Oh, stop. Stop, wait.

1538
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:24,291
Where art goest thou?

1539
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:27,375
Wait. Oh, please. Don't leave me.

1540
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:30,166
Art thou not coming with us?

1541
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,333
Oh.

1542
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:42,458
- Fare thee well, my sisters.
- Yes.

1543
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:47,875
Yes, and Winnie.
Sorrow is such sweet parting.

1544
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,916
Bye-bye.

1545
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,375
Goodbye.

1546
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:02,000
Magicae Maxim a, conversio.

1547
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:04,750
Rescind the spell.

1548
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,333
Undo what I have done. I beg of thee.

1549
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:19,583
They were the price you paid.

1550
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:22,125
Oh, not my sisters.

1551
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:26,375
My beloved, infuriating sisters?

1552
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,583
Why, they were my kin.

1553
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:34,500
Of course, I was the pretty one.

1554
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:38,333
But they were my passionate partners
in unholy mischief.

1555
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:40,541
Oh, what fun we had.

1556
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,083
Oh, Book.

1557
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:46,416
For old times' sake.

1558
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:49,416
Can nothing be done?

1559
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,250
My doing has been my undoing.

1560
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:04,708
My folly, my fate.

1561
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,166
Oh, what is this feeling?

1562
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,000
Ooh.

1563
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,916
I think it is my heart.

1564
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:14,791
I fear it is breaking.

1565
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,708
Oh, I cannot bear it.

1566
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,833
I must find a way.

1567
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,208
My sisters, my sisters.

1568
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,958
- Book?
- I must find a way.

1569
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,583
Thou art a new witch.

1570
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:37,500
Only a witch and her coven can manifest
what is written.

1571
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:41,000
Please will thou help me?

1572
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,833
Wait, you're willing to give up
your powers?

1573
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:46,208
My powers are nothing without my sisters.

1574
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:51,041
Becca. Book chose you.

1575
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:53,375
We're with you.

1576
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:59,458
- Okay. "The spell for reuniting."
- Okay.

1577
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,458
"Lost and gone and out of sight."

1578
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,333
- "Ichita cop it a melaka mystica."
- "Ichita cop it a melaka mystica."

1579
01:29:06,416 --> 01:29:08,416
Okay.

1580
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,458
"We cast the spell to reunite."

1581
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:13,041
- "Ichita cop it a melaka mystica."
- "Ichita cop it a melaka mystica."

1582
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:16,833
"What is meant to be together,
will be now until forever."

1583
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:23,833
But...

1584
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,750
What, what happened? Where are they?

1585
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:29,041
Does thou speak the spell correctly?

1586
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:34,625
The spell doesn't bring them back.

1587
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:37,125
It sends you to them.

1588
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:54,375
Oh, how marvelous.

1589
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,541
Thank thee.

1590
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,958
And how lucky art thou to have each other.

1591
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:07,833
Sisters.

1592
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:51,125
So are they gone, like gone, forever gone?

1593
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:56,375
Like, gone, as in, never, ever,
ever, ever coming back, right?

1594
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:57,958
Yeah, I guess...

1595
01:30:58,041 --> 01:31:00,041
Stop, Sanderson Sisters.

1596
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:02,625
Don't worry. We're here to help.

1597
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:03,958
Yeah, you're...

1598
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:06,291
you're a little late for that.

1599
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:07,958
They're gone?

1600
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,833
Oh, thank God. Oh.

1601
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:13,166
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1602
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,458
I was like, my first move
was to come in bold,

1603
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:16,750
like, "Stop Sanderson Sisters,"

1604
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:18,375
and then, you know... No, yeah, oh.

1605
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:20,000
It's been like this the whole day.

1606
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:23,208
Over here,
you directionless skeleton sack.

1607
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:24,333
It talked.

1608
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:25,375
Oh.

1609
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,666
I can speak.

1610
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:33,000
Come on, buddy. Just bringing your...
your body to your head here.

1611
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:35,583
I am not speaking to you.
Now give me my bones.

1612
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,041
- Okay. Don't you drop me.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1613
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,000
I won't.

1614
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,083
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Is he...

1615
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:51,375
- Tis about time.
- Yeah.

1616
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:56,625
Well, it would seem as though
their final destruction

1617
01:31:56,708 --> 01:32:02,000
undoes all the spells of that
wretched troll, Winifred Sanderson.

1618
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:04,166
You're Billy Butcher son.

1619
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,791
Winifred's boyfriend.

1620
01:32:05,875 --> 01:32:07,833
- Oh, my gosh, yes.
- Actually, no. Actually, no.

1621
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:09,458
- But, that's exactly what you told us.
- That's what you told us too, then.

1622
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:13,291
Nope. That is not the story,
and I'm gonna make sure

1623
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:14,833
everybody knows the truth, Billy.

1624
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:16,666
I promise.

1625
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:23,291
Thank you.
You're not nearly as vile as I thought.

1626
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:28,458
- Yeah.
- But now, I must bid you all goodnight.

1627
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:31,708
To my eternal rest.

1628
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:34,041
At last.

1629
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:37,375
- Sweet dreams.
- Goodnight.

1630
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:43,166
Becca, I owe you an apology.
Actually, I owe all of you an apology.

1631
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,375
You know, for...

1632
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:46,625
everything.

1633
01:32:47,666 --> 01:32:48,750
You know what, Gilbert?

1634
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:50,333
It actually worked out pretty good.

1635
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:53,791
Just no more magic candles, deal?

1636
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,458
No candle, deal.

1637
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:01,666
Well, I guess I will take Book back,
you know, to the shop.

1638
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,541
Actually I think I'm gonna keep it.

1639
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,208
Book could use a new home.

1640
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:10,041
Oh, it smiled, right?

1641
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:13,500
Okay. I guess I should check on Cobweb.

1642
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:15,333
He's seen a lot more action
than he's ever seen in his life,

1643
01:33:15,416 --> 01:33:16,500
I'm sure he's scared poopless.

1644
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:18,750
Gilbert?

1645
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,291
What's up?

1646
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,000
We'll see you at the shop?

1647
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:25,125
Yes, you will.

1648
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,250
Discounts, discounts.

1649
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:28,875
- Oh, wow.
- Twenty percent off.

1650
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:30,708
Ten p... ten percent off.

1651
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:35,083
So, what movie do you guys
want to watch tonight?

1652
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:37,416
Wait, sorry. Are we not gonna talk about
what just happened tonight?

1653
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,375
Because I feel like I missed a lot.

1654
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:43,125
Yeah. I guess if you consider
resurrecting evil witches,

1655
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,875
and then finding out your best friend
is a witch,

1656
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,375
and then helping her do a spell
to get rid of them

1657
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:51,125
as missing out, then, yeah,
totally missed out.

1658
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,875
Or, you know,
it's just your regular Halloween.

1659
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:55,666
Oh, yeah, totally.

1660
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,500
Do you think Susan
left those cookies out?

1661
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:58,583
Oh, yeah. I'm starving.

1662
01:33:58,666 --> 01:33:59,625
Oh, me too.

1663
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:00,666
What a crazy day.

1664
01:34:03,416 --> 01:34:07,125
- Guys, guys, what are we doing?
- I don't know.

1665
01:34:08,416 --> 01:34:10,416
What? Wait.
That's from the Walgreens.

1666
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,041
- That's the walk from the Walgreens.
- Yes. So then what did they do?

1667
01:34:12,125 --> 01:34:13,750
- Oh, my God. Yes.
- You do this.

1668
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,291
<i>Whoo!</i>

1669
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:26,916
Now, listen up.

1670
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,791
Lunch!
