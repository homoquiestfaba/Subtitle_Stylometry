1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,780
(film projector clicking)

2
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:12,359
(alarm clock beeping)

3
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:37,843
(soft music)

4
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,027
- [James] My father
always used to say to me,

5
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:01,850
"Son, you only come this way once.

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,233
See the world, tell people what you saw.

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Leave your mark,

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,210
interpret the human
experience through your lens."

9
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,190
So how did I end up here?

10
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,325
(car horn beeps)

11
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,000
(phone rings)

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,130
Good morning, James Hayes.

13
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,080
How may I help you?

14
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,893
Hey, Teresa.

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,940
He's downstairs to see me now?

16
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,493
Did he say he had an appointment?

17
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,223
Okay.

18
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,010
I gotta stop and get his loss report,

19
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,220
but tell him I'll be down
there in just a few minutes.

20
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,053
Yeah. Thank you.

21
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,193
- Look at that.

22
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,460
- That's it?

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,720
- What do you mean "That's it?"

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
My car didn't look like that before.

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,840
- Did you say your wife was
injured in this accident?

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,053
- Yeah, and?

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,830
- How could anyone
possibly have been injured?

28
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,590
I mean, the bumper's barely scratched.

29
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,480
- All I know is after the accident,

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,750
my wife's neck started hurting.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,090
So we went to the hospital

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,710
and they gave her a cervical collar

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,030
and a prescription for medicine.

34
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,440
We're supposed to follow
up with her doctor.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,370
That's what we're gonna do

36
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,423
and your company's gonna pay for it.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,757
- Let's go inside, Mr. Frowd.

38
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,837
(smooth music)

39
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,080
You know, sometimes when
I'm driving to work,

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,993
I wonder how the hell did I get here?

42
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:06,870
You get paid just enough

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,550
to create a lifestyle you wanna maintain,

44
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,890
but you'll never make enough money

45
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,430
to be as comfortable as you like.

46
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,370
- At least you have a
job, your bills get paid.

47
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,290
What's the big deal?

48
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,470
- The big deal is we give away
the best years of our life

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,830
and energy to a place we
don't really wanna be.

50
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,670
- Every morning when I come in,

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,000
I see you working on something

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that is clearly non-insurance related

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,500
on company time using company equipment

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,460
and it's not costing you a thing.

55
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,670
- I spend 40 to 45 minutes a day writing.

56
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,640
The rest of my day

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,270
is spent listening to people lie to me

58
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,530
and they don't even have
the decency to do it well.

59
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,170
- Speaking of lying and deceiving,

60
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,003
what do you think about that nonsense

61
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,830
they're trying to pull with the raises?

62
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,760
- You mean the raises we're
not getting this year?

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,120
- It's because our
expenses are really high.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,480
- Oh, come on, Angela.

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,600
The company's losing money

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,636
because of consistently poor decisions.

67
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,830
- That's not it.

68
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,770
- Obviously you've been
drinking the Kool-Aid.

69
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,350
- No, I just read the annual report.

70
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,840
- You know, two months ago they tell us

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,270
we're not getting the raises
that we deserve this year,

72
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,950
only to tell us last week that
they're spending $75 million

73
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,170
on a brand new hockey arena in a town

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,330
that doesn't have a hockey team

75
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,173
and never had one.
- Yeah, but it's not like

76
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:12,580
they're gonna write a
check out for 75 million.

77
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,033
- I mean, do they think
that we can't figure out

78
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,130
that we're not getting
the raises this year

79
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,980
because they're spending
money on unnecessary bullshit?

80
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,800
- [Angela] You have options.

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,820
- Yeah, so Angela,

82
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,513
since you've got those hooker heels on,

83
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:25,346
why don't you to come over here

84
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,010
and give me a quick lap dance?

85
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,829
- Grow some equipment
and I'll think about it.

86
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:30,662
- You know what?

87
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:31,670
Why don't you just give him some?

88
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,680
Maybe he'll leave you alone.

89
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,990
- He wouldn't know what to do

90
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,508
if he had printed instructions.

91
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,326
(phone chiming)

92
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,750
- She wishes I needed
printed instructions.

93
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,090
- Hello?

94
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,850
Hey, what's up?

95
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,750
Oh, I know. It was awesome, wasn't it?

96
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,563
- Let's get started.

97
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:50,550
- That's my supervisor, Sharon.

98
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,320
She's required by corporate to
hold these biweekly meetings

99
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,400
which are a complete waste of time.

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,650
I mean, I can't even
act like I care anymore.

101
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,840
Not at all.

102
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,140
Now you've already met Steve and Angela.

103
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,150
That's Holly and to her right is Greg.

104
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,680
The people I work with
make this job bearable.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Now the only reason I ask
questions in these stupid meetings

106
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,722
is to keep myself from falling asleep.

107
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:20,722
♪ We said all that we could say ♪

108
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,719
♪ Can you relate to me in another way ♪

109
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:32,048
♪ We said all that we could say ♪

110
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,764
Uh-oh.

111
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:36,943
- What?

112
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,790
- When a woman is looking at a dude

113
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,549
like you looking at me now-

114
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,778
- First of all, I'm not just some woman.

115
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,426
I am Sanaa Medcalf,

116
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:47,400
the love of your life.

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Now rephrase that.

118
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,997
- Okay.

119
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:54,300
When my crazy ass girlfriend, Sanaa,

120
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,030
is looking at me like
you looking at me now.

121
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,441
- Now why am I crazy?

122
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,829
(James groans)

123
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:03,237
- Because, damn, Sanaa,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

124
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,180
You gotta be at court
first thing in the morning.

125
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,831
And let's not forget we just had the best-

126
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,900
- We did not just have sex.

127
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,159
We made love.

128
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,210
(James chuckles)

129
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,080
- Are you gonna let me
finish the sentence?

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,073
- I just did.

131
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,068
- Just ask your question.

132
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,700
(Sanaa sighs)

133
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,533
- Well,

134
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,590
do you believe in open marriages?

135
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,610
- We're not married.

136
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,443
- Exactly.

137
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,073
So, I'm not talking about us.

138
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Answer the question.

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,693
- No.

140
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,353
I don't believe in open marriages.

141
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:42,920
- So you feel like you
could stay with one person

142
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,220
for the rest of your life?

143
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,343
- Well I hope so.

144
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,329
- Do you think that's realistic?

145
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:52,790
- Yeah.

146
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,643
Yeah, I do.

147
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,663
- I don't.

148
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,833
I think that some women
and most men cheat.

149
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,580
So, things would work out a lot better

150
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,480
if they could just be open

151
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,403
and honest with each other from the start.

152
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,490
- Okay, so why get married

153
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,820
if you wanna have sex with other people?

154
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,670
Just stay single.

155
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,925
- Do you think that I love you?

156
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,208
- [James] (chuckles) I hope so.

157
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,650
(Sanaa laughs)

158
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,609
- Stop being silly. You know I love you.

159
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:27,353
- Yes, baby, I know, I know.

160
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,353
You love me.

161
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,970
- What if I told you I wanted
to have sex with someone else?

162
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,120
- [James] Man or woman?

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,072
- Does it matter?

164
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,121
- [James] Yeah.

165
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:36,954
- Why?

166
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:37,790
- [James] Because if it's a woman,

167
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,473
I may wanna watch.

168
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,920
But if it's a man, I'm gonna
tell you to keep it moving.

169
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,800
- Well, I wouldn't mind if you
had sex with another woman.

170
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,963
- Okay, what's really going on here?

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,452
- Nothing.

172
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,980
We're just having a discussion, babe.

173
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,863
- Are you serious with all this?

174
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,240
- I just wanna pick your brain.

175
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,650
I think it's healthy for couples

176
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,036
to have these types of conversations.

177
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:10,500
♪ Show me, show me ♪

178
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,333
- Okay.

179
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,620
What if I said I wanted to
have sex with your sister?

180
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,863
- Karima?

181
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,960
- [James] Yeah, Karima.

182
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,663
What if I said I wanted
to have sex with Karima?

183
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,917
- So that's how you look at her?

184
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:29,050
- (laughs) No, but you just
sat up in here and said

185
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,420
you could watch me have
sex with another woman.

186
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,370
So what if that other woman was Karima?

187
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,303
- Yeah, but the fact that she was

188
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:39,250
the first person you thought about

189
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,072
makes me believe that
that's how you think of her.

190
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:43,050
- [James] (laughs) No, it doesn't.

191
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,443
- Yes, it does.

192
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,110
- Wait!

193
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,350
Sanaa.

194
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,293
Don't leave, Sanaa. Wait a minute!

195
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,560
Come on, hey, sweetheart.

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

197
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,142
Come back.

198
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:57,150
(door slams)

199
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,029
I knew it.

200
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,300
I knew it, I knew it,

201
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,193
and I still took the bait.

202
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,513
Boo.
- You know what?

203
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:06,660
This whole time that we've
been hanging out with Karima

204
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,410
you were secretly hoping I
would get drunk and fall asleep

205
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,170
so you could have sex with her.

206
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,960
- Get drunk? Fall asleep?

207
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,030
What are you talking about?

208
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,370
I didn't start this. You did!

209
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,250
- I was speaking hypothetically.

210
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,013
- Can we just get back in
bed and talk about this?

211
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:19,846
- No.

212
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:20,840
- Why are you feeling some type of way

213
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,613
about a conversation you started?

214
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,660
- Don't you remember me telling you

215
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,280
about the last guy I dated

216
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,203
who only used me to get to Karima?

217
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,891

about what I said about
your sister the other night?

283
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,133
- Yeah.

284
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm in my feelings a little bit.

285
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,370
- So you brought me out here

286
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,300
so you could be mad face-to-face?

287
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,133
- Pretty much.

288
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,840
- Babe, we were just
having a conversation.

289
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,740
I really didn't mean anything by that.

290
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,520
And you laughin'.

291
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,860
What's so funny?

292
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,190
- I'm not really mad at you.

293
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,450
I just wanted to see
you squirm a little bit.

294
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,900
- Really?

295
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,210
- I mean, yeah, okay.

296
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,250
I was a little upset that night

297
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,000
but I thought about it and, like you said,

298
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,750
we were just having a conversation.

299
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,710
But.

300
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,543
- [James] But.

301
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,320
- If we're ever out with Karima

302
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,373
and I even so much as think
that you're checking her out,

303
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,170
I'ma have your ass sent for a year.

304
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,859
- Yeah, I hear you, babe.

305
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,610
I'm a peaceful brother.

306
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,528
I don't want none of your
people pulling up on me.

307
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:07,466
(Sanaa laughs)

308
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,466
You gonna have your goons pull up on me?

309
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,454
- I might.

310
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,800
(James sighs)

311
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,260
- So, why did you wanna meet out here?

312
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,530
- Okay.

313
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,460
Um...

314
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,120
I am considering

315
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,547
moving to New York.

316
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,993
- New York? Why?

317
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,200
- Well, a partner's retiring

318
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,823
and they named a woman to replace him,

319
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,060
a black woman.

320
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,200
So she reached out

321
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,193
and she said that this would
be a good opportunity for me.

322
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,760
- Opportunity to do what?

323
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,013
- [Sanaa] To make partner.

324
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,733
- Did they say that they

325
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,360
were gonna make you partner, Sanaa?

326
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,910
- Well no, but with her on my side

327
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,310
I have a pretty good chance.

328
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,623
- So is this definite?

329
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,330
- Well, no, nothing's definite

330
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,907
especially I haven't
talked to you about it.

331
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,320
- Babe, I appreciate that, I really do,

332
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,533
but damn.

333
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,903
New York?

334
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,740
- I want you to come with me.

335
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,380
- How am I gonna go with you?

336
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,260
I'd have to find a job
and what about my house?

337
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,830
- Yeah, I mean, there's
plenty of insurance companies

338
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,663
in New York

339
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:28,837
and your house, shit, you can rent that.

340
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,050
- I don't want another job
in the insurance business.

341
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,180
And I'm not just gonna be able

342
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,770
to rent my house out just like that.

343
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,281
- Babe, you work in insurance already.

344
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,114
I don't see what the difference is.

345
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,740
- I don't want another
insurance job, Sanaa.

346
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,530
I wanna travel so I can blog about it.

347
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,340
- Yeah, you can do that eventually,

348
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,170
but babe, right now,

349
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,285
I mean, come on, this is-
- Wait, wait, wait,

350
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,400
wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

351
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,820
If we moved to New York,

352
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,157
it's gonna about money, marriage,

353
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:54,957
and Sanaa, what if you get pregnant?

354
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,793
- Well, what would be so wrong about that?

355
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,950
- Nothing would be wrong with any of that

356
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,600
once I'm established as a writer.

357
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,460
- All right.

358
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
I'll leave it alone.

359
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,753
I'm not gonna rush you into anything.

360

Just know that this is a
huge opportunity for me.

Uncle Tony!

370
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,770
- Nephew, what's going on, baby?

371
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,350
- What's good?

372
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,183
Come on in.

373
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:54,190
Hey man, why don't you get
yourself a nine millimeter

374
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,750
and get rid of that starter pistol?

375
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,662
- Shit, it'll put a hole in you.

376
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,250
- Yeah, but you only got six shots.

377
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,870
- Shit, all I need is one.

378
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,540
- I still say you need a
nine millimeter though.

379
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,973
- Nah, revolvers don't jam.

380
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,895
Hold on, hold on.

381
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:08,470
- What?

382
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,650
- How are you gonna have
me over here at dinner time

383
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,151
and I don't smell no grease?

384
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,920
- Uncle, who said anything about cooking?

385
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,550
I called you over here so we can talk.

386
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,089

over here at dinner time

387

and you ain't got no food on the table?

388

- I don't even cook for myself.

So you know I'm not cooking you jack.

390

what you got me over here for?

392
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,010

- Personally?

406

I usually like them a little
thicker than that, you know?

407

I like them like Serena Williams.

That real big fat-

409

Whoo.

You wild, Unc.

412
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,082
That's not what I meant.

413

I know what you meant.

- I mean, you know, she seems nice.

417

You know, I didn't talk to her that much.

She's a lawyer, right?

- Yeah.

420

- What's the problem?

421
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,420
- She got a job offer in New York,

422
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,980
wants me to go with her.

423
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,270
- Weigh your options, make a decision.

- Oh, I don't wanna go

425
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,540
but I love her, I care about her.

426
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,980
So me saying, "I don't wanna go"

427
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,750
it's just not that easy.

428
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,240
- So if you don't wanna go, don't go.

429
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,490
All that other stuff is your heart

430
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,140
trying to override what your mind

431
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,030
knows to be true.

432
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,250
- I don't know if I
wanna go down this road.

- I don't know. We haven't
talked about all that.

435
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,311
- Do you think she wants to marry you?

436
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,070
- I don't know. I don't know.

437
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,690

- Yes.

439
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,703

440
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,620
And you say you care about her.

441
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,453
- I do.

442

- You say you care about her

443
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,059
but you don't wanna tell her

444
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,743
that you don't wanna move to New York.

445
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:13,620
That doesn't make any sense to me.

446
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,380
- That's why I'm over here
talking to you about it.

- If you say you care about her

451
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,813
and you're not ready to commit,

452
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:24,910
what you gotta do

453
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,720
is let her go to New York
and meet other people.

- If she meets a guy that
she wants to be with,

457
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,033
you let her go.

458
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,820
That's the way you treat
somebody you care about.

459
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,840
Now the selfish thing to do

460
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,350
is to, is to, you know,

461
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,807
lie to yourself and lie to her

462
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,320
and keep her around

463
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,610
until you figure out what you wanna do

464
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,810
with no regard to how
it's gonna affect her.

465
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,224
- So just tell her I don't wanna go?

466
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:54,560
- Why don't you wanna go?

467
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,429
- Because, Unc, I wanna quit my job.

468
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:58,262
You know that.

469
00:17:58,262 --> 00:17:59,100
I wanna travel,

470
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,340
I wanna shoot my videos,

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,477
I wanna blog and I wanna write about it

472
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:03,520
and if I go off to New York with her,

473
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,833
it's gonna be about her,
it's gonna be more expensive,

474
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,330

able to do my own thing.

No, fuck that.

I'm gonna say it just like this.

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,840
You tell whoever is still at the house

487

to tell Shamal that he better
find me before I find him.

488

It's as simple as that.

All right, I'll see
y'all when I get there.

What about this time next Wednesday?

- Oh, it's just someone from work.

502
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,323
- Can it wait till tomorrow?

503
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,610
- No, she actually,

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,660
she's working out of her New York office.

505
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,803
What?

506
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,194
- You should go natural, grow an Afro.

508
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:28,860

- No, sweetheart, that's not me.

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,660
Plus I don't think that'll
go over well at work.

513
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,830
- Ah, so that's it.

514
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,330
They won't let you go natural.

515
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,140
- No, they can't stop me.

516
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,300
But I think that it might
inhibit my advancement.

517
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,500
- Chemicals and all, out
here trying to assimilate.

518
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,710
- I am not trying to assimilate.

519
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,320
I like my hair the way it is.

520
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,990
I got you with my hair like this.

521
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,770
- Damn, babe, that's because
I used to squint real hard

522
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,752
and then I'd fantasize, ooh,

523
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,447
with a big old Angela Davis Afro!

524
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,173
You would look like this, babe.

525
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,303
So you wanna talk about

526
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,183
that big pink elephant sitting
in that chair over there?

527
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:25,547
- Oh, you mean New York?

00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:28,689
- Yes.

529
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,333
- Well, I wanna go.

530
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,175
Are you coming with me?

- No.

532
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:45,127
- Well, why not?

533
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,310
You don't think it would
be a good move for us?

534
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,820
- I think it'd be a great
move for you and your career.

535
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,070
- No, it would be a good
move for the both of us.

536
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,040
I mean, you've established a career

537

in the insurance industry

538
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,170
and you can just take it to the next level

539
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,490
by coming to New York.

540
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,610
- Sanaa, you know I don't like my job.

541
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,560
I hate it.

542
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,360
- [Sanaa] Yeah, but your
job is your reality.

543
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,860
- You know, to me, you only
got two options in life.

544
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,870
You can either live your dream

545
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,290
or help someone else live theirs.

546
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,090
And I'm tired of helping other
people live their dreams.

547
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,520
- So you think coming to New York,

548
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,560
you'll be helping me live my dream?

549
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,000
- I was talking about
me, my life, my career.

550
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,730
I wanna get up and do
what I love for a living.

551
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,370
- That's unrealistic.

552
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean, I love my career too,

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,230
but there's sometimes I don't
feel like getting out of bed.

554
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,361
I mean, everybody feels like that.

555
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,570
- Would you practice law for free?

556
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,670
- No.

557
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,340
- Well see, I travel,

558
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,320
I shoot video, and I blog about it

559
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,570
and I do it for free because I love it

560
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,570
and I wanna do what I love for a living.

561
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,363
- What you're talking about is a hobby.

562
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,110
- I'm gonna make a career out of it.

563
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,427
I don't know why you
don't understand that.

564
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,277
- So you're really not coming?

565
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:03,840
- No, I gotta be on the right path

566
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,650
before I can make a move like that.

567
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
- Well what about us?

568
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,750
- If you go to New York

569
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,800
and you're meeting another people

570
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,688
and you're working on-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

571
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:18,102
Hold on.
- What, what?

572
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:19,690
- Meeting other people?

573
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,730
I thought we were in a
committed relationship.

574
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,980
- We are.

575
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,280
- So why are you talking
about meeting other people?

576
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,650
Is that what you're trying to do?

577
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,490
- Of course not.

578
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,640
But what I'm saying is-

579
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,977
- No, I heard exactly what you said.

580
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:33,270
I think it's some bullshit.

581
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,650
I think that you had a Freudian slip

582
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,340
and now you're trying
to reel back from it.

583
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,603
- It wasn't a Freudian slip.

584
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:38,510
I meant what I said.

585
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,343
- I know!

586
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,995
- Hold on, hold on.
- No, don't touch me!

587
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:41,828
- Will you just relax?

588
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:42,661
Babe, just chill out for a minute.

589
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,173
- Get off of me!
- Okay, I'm not touching you.

590
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,640
- So, what, I'm supposed to think

591
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,840
that you're going to sit
in front of your computer

592
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,891
for 24 hours?

593
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:54,724
You know what?

594
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,180
If you didn't wanna be together,

595
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,843
you should've just said something.

596
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,540
I can't do this.

597
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,777
- Wait a minute.

598
00:23:02,777 --> 00:23:03,610
Hold on.

599
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,943
Come on now.

600
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,150
Can we talk about this?

601
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,340
- We just did!

602
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,840
- I don't wanna leave
things unresolved like this!

603
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,473
(door slams)

604
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,396
(soft pop music)

605
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,670
May I speak to Oscar Heiler, please?

606
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,420
Yes, ma'am. My name is James Hayes.

607
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,490
Yeah, I submitted an article
for next month's publication.

608
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,323
Good morning.

609
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:44,660
My name is James Hayes

610
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,600
and I submitted a story for December

611
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,300
and I got an email from you guys

612
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,940
saying that you needed some
more source information.

613
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,012
This is James Hayes.

614
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:53,845
Mm-hmm.

615
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,670
And I submitted a piece.

616
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,430
Hey Beau, what's going on, man?

617
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,780
I'm doing good.

618
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,700
Hey, well I was looking at the rough cut

619
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,340
from Rio last night

620
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,940
and there's some things I
wanna incorporate into it.

621
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,260
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,860
I'm gonna send you the edit now.

623
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,120
Be careful.

624
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
See what I'm talking about?

625
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,730
This, this?

626
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,900
- Oh yeah, damn.

627
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,733
- [James] Yeah.

628
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,463
All of that.

629
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,903
- Yeah, see here, see?

630
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,370
They used nails instead of screws

631
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,210
and they're pulling right out.

632
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,437
- [James] Oh, okay, okay.

633
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,143
- That's an easy fix though.

634
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,073
- So how much is it going to cost me?

635
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:42,870
- It's not gonna cost you anything.

636
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,590
I'm gonna show you exactly
what needs to be done

637
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,770
and I'm gonna watch you do it.

638
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,280
- Come on, Unc, you know
I'm not handy like that.

639
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,113
- Yeah, I know,

640
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:49,960
that's why I'm gonna supervise.

641
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,110
(James laughs)

642
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,210
You talk to Sanaa about going to New York?

643
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,710
- Yeah.

644
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,543
- [Tony] And?

645
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,773
- She's in New York.

646
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,817
- I take that to mean you're not goin'?

647
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,500
- I told her to go up there, chill,

648
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,850
and she didn't find someone,

649
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,200
maybe we could be together.

650
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,730
- Is that how you said it to her?

651
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,563
- Yeah.

652
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:19,490
- No wonder she left.

653
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,323
- What you mean?

654
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:21,187
That's what you told me to say.

655
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,960
- Yeah, but I thought
you'd be smart enough

656
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
to say it the right way.

657
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,440
- Well, be that as it may,
what's done is done, so.

658
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,504
- [Tony] When did she leave?

659
00:25:30,504 --> 00:25:32,340
- Mm, about two weeks ago.

660
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,690
- When was the last time you spoke to her?

661
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,230
- Tried to call her numerous times,

662
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,670
she won't answer the phone,

663
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,320
won't respond to my texts either.

664
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,700
(Tony scoffs)

665
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,740
- So how's the video blogging
and writing stuff going?

666
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,830
- Now that's going good.

667
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,513
As a matter of fact, on my way to Europe.

668
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,373
- Europe?
- Yeah.

669
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,917
- Didn't you just come back
from Rio a couple months ago?

670
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,060
- [James] Mm-hmm.

671
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,560
- [Tony] Are you sure that you
can afford to go to Europe?

672
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,010
- Unc, I can't afford not to.

673
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,620
- I respect that.

674
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,120
Stepping out on faith.

675
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,730
- Coming from you, that
means everything, man.

676
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,563
Everything.

677
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,017
So what's up with this?

678
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,683
- Next weekend.

679
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,140
Yeah, next weekend should be good.

680
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,400
- Cool.

681
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,200
- Since you're a writer,

682
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,910
the next time you have
something to say to Sanaa,

683
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,200
you should probably
write to her, all right?

684
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,473
This way there's a 50/50 chance

685
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:27,610
that you'll be able to edit yourself

686
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,130
before you say some stupid shit like,

687
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,592
I wanna have a threesome with her sister.

688
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:31,425
- [James] You think you
know what, you got jokes.

689
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,258
You think you funny.

690
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,219
- I'm serious.

691
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:34,380
- [James] So that's
how you do nephew, huh?

692
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,810
- It might be the best
advice I ever gave you.

693
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,950
- [James] You got jokes. Very funny.

694
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,612
- Now let's get out of
here. It's hot as shit.

695
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:40,270
- Of course.

696
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,100
Going at me about her sister.

697
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,433
Boy, I tell you.

698
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,150
(soft pop music)

699
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,085
Yes, sir.

700
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:52,710
Firststateinsurance.com.

701
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,370
Just like it's...

702
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,920
Yes, sir, I'll spell it for you.

703
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,920
F-I-R-S-T insurance.com. That's right.

704
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,890
Okay.

705
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,010
Yeah, once I receive it,

706
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,410
I should be able to get payment to you

707
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,940
in a couple of days.

708
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,210
Yes, sir.

709
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,363
Thank you for calling.

710
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,780
(phone rings)

711
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,870
Good morning. This is Jay.

712
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,913
How can I help you?

713
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,450
You wanna know if I received
the email, Mr. Frowd?

714
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,893
Did you get an error message?

715
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,783
Well then that means the

716
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,330

730
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:04,760
- Excuse me, sir. Do you have any change?

731
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,680
I'm just trying to get enough money

732
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,710
to pay for my hotel room.

733
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,979
They won't let me back
in the room until I pay.

734
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,279
- [James] No, I can't help you.

735
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,380
- You don't have to give the money to me.

736
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,784
Just go to the lobby.

737
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,084
- I don't have any change.

738
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,430
- Man.

739
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,350
(car horn honks)

740
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,064
Excuse me, Miss. Excuse me.

741
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:22,090
(soft music)

742
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,290
- [James] When people
come up to me begging,

743
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,953
I usually just brush them off.

744
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,370
But for some reason,

745
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,863
I couldn't forget about
that woman at the store.

746
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,650
- Look, I appreciate you
taking care of this room

747
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,750
and helping me with my bags and all,

748
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,507
but I don't have nothing for you.

749
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,419
- How did you end up homeless?

750
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,260
- We ain't even got that kind of time.

751
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,683
- As a matter of fact, I do.

752
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,000
All right, now look.

753
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,180
This is just gonna be two people

754
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,870
having a conversation, okay.

755
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,840
Real easy.

756
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,990
We're just talking

757
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,815
like we did a couple of days ago, okay?

758
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:39,648
- Okay.

759
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:40,966
All right.

760
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,380
Where do I start?

761
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,283
- Why don't you tell me

762
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:46,450
the first recollection of your family?

763
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:48,980
- Okay.

764
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,723
It may sound strange but my
first memory is of my mom.

765
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,023
She was arguing with someone
on the other side of the door.

766
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,050
I was really little,

767
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,360
maybe like two or three.

768
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,040
I couldn't tell what
she was arguing about,

769
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,940
but I remember that it was a man

770
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
and she was so upset.

771
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,710
He was screaming and cussing her out,

772
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,800
calling out her name.

773
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,883
It was a mess.

774
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,780
(phone rings)

775
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,860
Hello?

776
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,150
- Hey, I just finished the edit.

777
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,814
We're about to go live.

778
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,370
- About to go live?

779
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,310
- Yeah, the Gram, Twitter,

780
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,500
Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo, everywhere.

781
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,333
- Wait, okay.

782
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,224
So how am I gonna see it?

783
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:38,869
You know I don't have a phone.

784
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:41,110
- They got computers in the
hotel lobby, don't they?

785
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,370
- Yeah, but I never used them.

786
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,768
- They're for the guests
and you're a guest.

787
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:47,430
- All right, I'll check it out.

788
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,560
- Okay.

789
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,530
Hey, how's that job search going?

790
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,350
- Nothing ye but I'm
gonna keep it pushing.

791
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,630
- It's gonna happen for you.

792
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,750
You're too strong of
a girl to be kept out.

793
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,340
- Yeah, I really hope you're right.

794
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,090
- Well, look, I'm gonna get
back to the grind, okay?

795
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,790
You call me if you need something.

796
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,240
- You want to take a six
week leave of absence

797
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,210
to go to Europe to do what?

798
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,453
- Well I'd like to finish a project

799
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:12,626
I've been working on and I-

800
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,550
- Project? What project?

801
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,310
- Well, it has nothing
to do with insurance.

802
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,830
It's something I actually
do outside of work.

803
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,920
- And what kind of project is it?

804
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,570
- Well I'm writing and shooting a video

805
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,840
on international travel.

806
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,980
- That's the kind of stuff
you do when you retire.

807
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,280
- Well, the retired
people I see when I travel

808
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,930
don't seem like they're
enjoying themselves.

809
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,000
As a matter of fact, they look like

810
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,020
they just wanna sit down somewhere

811
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,840
and, you know, Sharon, I want to do this

812
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,930
while I'm still young, you know,

813
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,920
while I can still turn up.

814
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,221
- Turn what up?

815
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:42,054
(James chuckles)

816
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:43,850
- All I'm asking for is
three additional weeks

817
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,623
on top of the three I already have.

818
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,023
- Three weeks.

819
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:58,140
(upbeat music)

820
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,000
- My first stop was in Southern France

821
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,831
for the Cannes Film Festival.

822
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,280
(James speaking foreign language)

823
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,630
Natalie Portman, Kate
Blanchett were all there.

824
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,250
I was also just on the outside,

825
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,633
but I was there too.

826
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:14,849
(singing in foreign language)

827
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,173
And then on to Paris.

828
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,617
The Louvre Museum.

829
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:29,453
By the way, the Mona Lisa is a lot smaller

830
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,203
than you would think.

831
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,570
Get a flight to Rome to see the Colosseum.

832
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:15,578
And then back to reality.

833
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,958
(phone chiming)

834
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,206
Hello?

835
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,213
- [Sanaa] Hey, it's Sanaa.

836
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:40,450
- I know.

837
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,410
I still have your number
programmed in my phone.

838
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,770
- [Sanaa] First of all, let me apologize

839
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,470
for not taking your calls
or responding to your texts.

840
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,133
- Yeah.

841
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,560
I would've thought you were dead

842
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,943
unless your mom would
have told me otherwise.

843
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,526
- [Sanaa] I just...

844
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,320
It was a lot with the move and everything.

845
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,270
- I get it.

846
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,309
I get it, Sanaa.

847
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,830
But I thought you may have

848
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,780
at least called me before you left.

849
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,630
- [Sanaa] I wanted to but
I didn't know what to say.

850
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,510
All I could think about

851
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,760
was the fact that you
weren't coming with me.

852
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,803
And I knew if I saw you, it
would all come back to that.

853
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,280
- So how are things going?

854
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,270
- [Sanaa] Great.

855
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,420
I'm learning a lot.

856
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,670
I have more responsibility
than I did before.

857
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,459
I'm adjusting.

858
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,660
So what's going on with you?

859
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,310
- Well I literally just
walked through the door

860
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,520
from Europe.

861
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,903
Phone rang and it was you.

862
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,012
- [Sanaa] Wow.

863
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,870
I always wanted to go there.

864
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,703
Couldn't wait to dump me

865
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,351
so you could start jet setting, right?

866
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:44,060
(Sanaa chuckles)

867
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,300
- So when are you coming back to Atlanta?

868
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,714
- [Sanaa] Thanksgiving.

869
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:49,514
Yeah, I'll be back for Thanksgiving.

870
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,780
- Well, when you get in town,

871
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,630
if you got some time, give me a call.

872
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:02,911
- [Sanaa] That would be my first thought.

873
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,010
Jay, can you hang on for a second?

874
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,843
- Yeah.

875
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:14,207
- [Sanaa] I really have
to go. I'm still at work.

876
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,524
It's good to hear your voice though, Jay.

877
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,863
- Yeah, it was good talking to you too.

878
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,326

894
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,930
- Yeah, I am.

895
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,060
- [James] I just called him.

896
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,280
He said he'd be here in about 20 minutes.

897
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,113
- Wow.

898
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,720
I don't have time to wait.

899
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,760
All right. Thank you.

900
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,610
- You're welcome.

901
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,980
Hey, I was gonna tell you, if you...

902
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,010
You wanna roll your
window down a little bit?

903
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,330
- I can hear you.

904
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,030
- Yeah, but I can barely hear you.

905
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,170
- [Monet] I'll talk louder.

906
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,559
- What do you think I'm gonna do?

907
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,760
- [Monet] I don't know.

908
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,360
- I'm saying I'm waiting
for Beau just like you are.

909
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,213
- Okay.

910
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,260
- I was just gonna say, you
know, if you had to leave,

911
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,200
I could tell Beau that you were here,

912
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,550
but you just couldn't stay.

913
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,490
- I was just about to call him.

914
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,119
I'm good. Thank you.

915
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,027
- All right.

916
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:53,610
I'm just trying to help.

917
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,797
- Thank you.

918
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:56,214
- You're welcome.

919
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:11,769
(dog barks)

920
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,303
- No.

921
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,663
Why?

922
00:38:20,274 --> 00:38:23,143
Come on, come on, come on.

923
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,033
Damn.

924
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,860
Hey, do you mind if I use your phone?

925
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,743
My battery died and I
don't have my charger.

926
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,850
- Can I see your teeth first?

927
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,380
- Why do you need to see my teeth?

928
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,993
- To make sure you got some.

929
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,683
There you go. That wasn't so hard.

930
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,020
- It's locked.

931
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,070
- [James] Oh, my bad.

932
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,160
- Thank you.

933
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,257
- Mm-hmm.

934
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,400
I just tried to call Beau

935
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,690
just before you pulled up.

936
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,700
He's probably not answering

937
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,280
because he'll be here in a few minutes.

938
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,660
- Okay.

939
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,810
Well, I might as well sit.

940
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,763
- Yeah, sit.

941
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,456
- I guess I can wait on him.

942
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,130
So when did you go to France?

943
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,760
- Actually, a couple of weeks ago.

944
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,593
That's why I'm here.

945
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:40,500
Dropping off some of my footage to Beau.

946
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,100
You ever been to France?

947
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,010
- I went there to study for a semester.

948
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,957
- Uh-huh, wow was it?

949
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:46,950
- Um, it was nice.

950
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,370
It was really a great experience.

951
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,660
I got to see a lot of Europe

952
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,820
and see a lot different
people, different cultures.

953
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,850
It was cool.

954
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,314
- You must speak French fluently.

955
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,470
(both chuckle)

956
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,920
- Well, I wouldn't say fluently,

957
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,420
but I know a little something.

958
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,180
I mean, I think the problem
is that people from France,

959
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,706
they speak so fast and the
accent is so different.

960
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:08,956
- Right, right.

961
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,920
- Yeah, I'm just used to people

962
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,300
from America speaking
French and, you know,

963
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,710
but I made it work.

964
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,060
- There you go, there you go.

965
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,047
Obviously, learning a foreign
language can be tough.

966
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:19,880
- Mm-hmm.

967
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:22,580
You go by yourself?

968
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,010
- Yeah, I did.

969
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,010
Actually, I needed to get
away for a little bit.

970
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,330
I was also finishing up a project.

971
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,470
Then I went to the Cannes Film Festival.

972
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,830
Man, that was awesome.

973
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,690
- What do you do?

974
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,980
- I work for an insurance company.

975
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,780
You know, but what I really wanna do

976
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,130
is I wanna travel and shoot video

977
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,060
and tell my story like only I can,

978
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,700
you know what I mean?

979
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,640
Yeah.
- Right. That's nice.

980
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,660
- How about you?

981
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,760
- I'm a photographer.

982
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,550
- Head shots and baby photos?

983
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,383
- No.

984
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,216
(both chuckle)

985
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,990
More like urban landscapes and-

986
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,823
- Really?

987
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:59,460
- I like to take pictures of
people with interesting faces.

988
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,713
- Nice, nice.

989
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,150
- You know, I like how
natural light hits an object,

990
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,020
so I just try to capture it.

991
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,250
- That's awesome. That's awesome.

992
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,400
I'd love to see some
of your work sometime.

993
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,430
- Yeah, you can ask Beau.

994
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,300
I'll let him know that you
wanna see some of my stuff.

995
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,050
He's working on a reel
for me right now, so.

996
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,710
- Mm, I would like for you

997
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,363
to show me some of your work.

998
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,273
- Why?

999
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:22,650
- Because it's your work. (laughs)

1000
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,483
Duh.

1001
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,333
I'm Jay.

1002
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,163
- Monet.

1003
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:28,030
Nice to meet you.

1004
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,013
- Nice to meet you.

1005
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,470
- So is Jay your government name

1006
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,692
or is it some kind of nickname?

1007
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,960
- Yeah, it's short for James.

1008
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,490
- Okay.

1009
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,730
And my name really is Monet,

1010
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,320
not Diamond or Lexi or
some kind of stage name.

1011
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,080
- You don't have a stage name, do you?

1012
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,130
- No.

1013
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,840
I haven't had a stage name

1014
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,790
since fifth grade when I played Juliet.

1015
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,740
And if I did have a stage name?

1016
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,080
- Gotta get it how you live.

1017
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,823
- Yeah, okay.

1018
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,160
Most men say they'd date a stripper,

1019
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,340
but if it came down to it,

1020
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,570
they wouldn't even take her seriously.

1021
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,880
- Wait, you trying to date me?

1022
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,817
- I didn't say you.

1023
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:07,807
(James laughs)

1024
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:10,757
I said most men.
- Oh, you did, you did.

1025
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:15,197
So when are you gonna let
me see some of your work?

1026
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,860
- I'll give you my number

1027
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,630
and then we can talk on the phone first

1028
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,160
and then we'll see.

1029
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,640
- Okay, so let me ask you this.

1030
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,690

00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,973
- What?

1040
00:42:46,973 --> 00:42:51,270
I love, love, love, love
me some old-school hip-hop.

1041
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,523
- Okay, Biggie or Pop?

1042
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,470
- Biggie.

1043
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,790
- J. Cole or Kendrick Lamar?

1044
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,670
- J. Cole.

1045
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,163
- Drake or Weezy F Baby?

1046
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,580
- Drake.

1047
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,630
- Best to ever do it?

1048
00:43:07,037 --> 00:43:08,630
- Hmm.

1049
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,050
Commercially, you'd have to say Jay Z.

1050
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,140
But Illmatic may be the
illest album of all time.

1051
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,210
So is Nas the greatest?

1052
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,620
Then Snoop's been around 20 years

1053
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,710
and then you still got
Black Thought, Rakim,

1054
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,313
Eminem, Biggie, Pusha T.

1055
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,070
I mean, you could make an argument

1056
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,620
with any one of those guys, so.

1057
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,213
- Wow.

1058
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:32,970
Impressive.

1059
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,610
- My roommate when I was in grad school,

1060
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,640
she was an intern for a label.

1061
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,523
So she used to keep me up on everything.

1062
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,810
- Grad school?

1063
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,050
- Yeah.

1064
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,620
I got my master's degree in education,

1065
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,380
even though I knew I
wanted to be an artist.

1066
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,070
- So why get a master's in education

1067
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,533
if you wanted to be a photographer?

1068
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,490
- My parents wanted me to
have something to fall back on

1069
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,080
in case the creative
thing didn't work out.

1070
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,480
So I promised them that I
would get my master's degree

1071
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,850
and then they gave me a
little bit of seed money

1072
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,685
to tie me over just in
case things didn't work out

1073
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,453
and, you know, that way
I could get started.

1074
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,390
- Sounds like a waste of money to me.

1075
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,170
- Mm-mm.

1076
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,550
No, you are totally off base with that.

1077
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,230
- Okay, so tell me one meaningful thing

1078
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,360
you learned while you were in grad school.

1079
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,910
- The word Negus, N-E-G-U-S,

1080
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,140
is a word using in reference
to Ethiopian sovereignty

1081
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,340
and the root of the word, N-G-S a noun

1082
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,440
derived from the ancient language of Geez.

1083
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,700
So basically when someone refers

1084
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,830
to a group of people as niggas,

1085
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,230
they're basically calling
them a group of kings.

1086
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,600
- That's not true

1087
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,930
because I'm quite sure
that back in the day,

1088
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,160
master was not referring
to his slaves as kings.

1089
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,470
- Right, because they were ignorant

1090
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,330
about where the word came
from and what it meant

1091
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,763
much like yourself before I told you.

1092
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,192
- How do I know that's true?

1093
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,270
- Okay, well, since
you're a visual person,

1094
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,180
go to YouTube and type
in spelling bee N-E-G-U-S

1095
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,030
and then you don't even have to

1096
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,810
tax your little brain to read.

1097
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,410
They use it in a national spelling bee.

1098
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,380
Now there's so much more to the
etymology of the word nigger

1099
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,710
but I don't even want to go into it

1100
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,763
because your whole head might explode.

1101
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,562
- I'm just gonna let that go.

1102
00:45:22,562 --> 00:45:25,145
(Monet laughs)

1103
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:28,320
I totally didn't mean to say that.

1104
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,670
I'm a good girl.

1105
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,760
- You know, we're gonna have to have

1106
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,750
some sort of date set up
before we get off this phone.

1107
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,260
I mean, we've been havin'
hella conversations

1108
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,440
and I feel like it's my duty,

1109
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,187
no, no, no, my obligation
to get us in the same space.

1110

So you don't like girls
that look like that?

1131
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,623

she don't have to put it
all out there like that.

1135
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,920
- Oh, so you calling her a thot.

1136
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,260
- She a little thotty, a little thotty.

1137
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,030
- What is a thot?

1138
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,400
- You know.

1139
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,573
A bird.

1140
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,179
- No, I wanna hear your definition.

1141
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:37,100
(James laughs nervously)

1142
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,620
- You know, uh...

1143
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,700
Come on, Monet. Stop playing with me.

1144
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,050
You know what a thot is.

1145
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,883
Come on.

1146
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:42,716
- So what do you call a guy

1147
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,683
that exhibits the same behavior?

1148
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,323
- Uh, for a guy?

1149
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,050
A player. Player?

1150
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,780
- Okay, so same, same situation,

1151
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,060
but different connotation based on gender?

1152
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,893
Right.

1153
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:04,080
And you think that's right?

1154
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,680
- Probably not, but I mean, let's face it.

1155
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,503
That's the reality of
the world we live in.

1156
00:47:08,503 --> 00:47:09,650
- Ah.

1157
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,450
Kind of like how women
get paid way less money

1158
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,067
than men to do the same exact job.

1159
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:14,900
- Wait, wait, wait.

1160
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,090
Pay disparity is institutional.

1161
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:20,210
Sexual mores are more societal.

1162
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,210
Yeah.

1163
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,730
- Okay, and one affects the other.

1164
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,760
You men are raised with
an antiquated notion

1165
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,370
of what it is to be a woman

1166
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,620
and you take that with
you everywhere you go.

1167
00:47:32,743 --> 00:47:33,576
(James chuckles)

1168
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:34,950
- Do you secretly hate men?

1169
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,320
- No.

1170
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,570
Not all of you.

1171
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,860
I do love my dad and
my brother very dearly.

1172
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,693
- What am I supposed to think

1173
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:45,140
when I see a woman like
that with a body like that

1174
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,393
walking down the street dressed like that?

1175
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,296
- She's liberated.

1176
00:47:51,296 --> 00:47:52,129
(both laugh)

1177
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:53,080
- Now you said liberated.

1178
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,840
Come on, I don't want
that kind of liberation

1179
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,250
for my daughter.

1180
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,070
- Okay, well then you better impregnate

1181
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,160
a forward-thinking fully developed woman.

1182
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,570
And the only way you're
gonna be able to do that

1183
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,467
is if you open up your mind

1184
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,310
and start forming your own opinions

1185
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,570
instead of carrying on these antiquated

1186
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,193
and provincial ways of thinking.

1187
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,047
What?

1188
00:48:15,047 --> 00:48:17,050
- You know what, ordinarily,

1189
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,850
this kind of conversation
would be a huge turnoff.

1190
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,233
But for some reason today,

1191
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,000
I find it real stimulating.

1192
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,350

I know this sounds random as hell,

1229
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,630

is particular to the south.

00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:12,290
- You have any other random
things you wanna ask me?

1247
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,350
Why is the sky blue?

1248
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,203
Where do babies come from?

1249
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,550
Why does a caged bird sing?

1250
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,150
- Very funny. Very funny.

1251
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,614

(crowds chattering in foreign language)

1260
00:50:56,313 --> 00:50:58,896
(phone chimes)

1261
00:51:03,113 --> 00:51:04,097
- Damn.

1262
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:06,020
- What's the matter?

1263
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,320
- Another rejection email.

1264
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,340
- How many travel sites did you submit to?

1265
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,720
- A lot.

1266
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,920
- How many rejected you?

1267
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,403
- 100%.

1268
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,580
- You sent the guy you met from VICE TV

1269
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,880
the links to your documentaries

1270
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,730
from Morocco and Brazil, right?

1271
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,010
They may call you. You never know.

1272
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,800
- They ain't gonna call me.

1273
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,610
- Stop with your negative energy.

1274
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,443
- Got it.

1275
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:38,227
- I think I'm gonna make you some dinner.

1276
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,033
That'll change your mood.

1277
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:49,710
- Ooh, okay, okay.

1278
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,650
Ooh, this looks good.

1279
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,550
- I would hope so.

1280
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:55,308
- Have a seat.

1281
00:51:55,308 --> 00:51:56,141
- Thanks.

1282
00:51:56,141 --> 00:51:58,499
- All right, let's pray before we eat.

1283
00:51:58,499 --> 00:51:59,932
- Okay.

1284
00:51:59,932 --> 00:52:02,150
- Lord, thank you for this
food we're about to receive,

1285
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,760
bless the hands that prepared it,

1286
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,670
and may it nourish our
body for Christ's sake.

1287
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:06,640
Amen.

1288
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,473
- Amen.

1289
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,143
Let me know how it tastes.

1290
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:11,726
- Oh, I'm about to.

1291
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,290
Mm, mm, Monet.

1292
00:52:18,794 --> 00:52:20,222
Mm-mm.

1293
00:52:20,222 --> 00:52:21,143
This is good.

1294
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:23,070
This is really, really good.

1295
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,463
- Yeah?

1296
00:52:24,463 --> 00:52:25,296
- [Announcer On TV]
Think it's time to hear

1297
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:27,574
your wife's secret confession.

1298
00:52:27,574 --> 00:52:29,698
Julia, we came here today
to tell your husband-

1299
00:52:29,698 --> 00:52:31,260
- I want you to go to church with me.

1300
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,600
- Where do you go to church?

1301
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,222
- Mount Calvary.

1302
00:52:34,222 --> 00:52:36,090
- Yeah, I know exactly where that is.

1303
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,220
Matter of fact,

1304
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,710
I visited there a couple times

1305
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,700
before I decided to stop going to church.

1306
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,000
- Why'd you stop going to church?

1307
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,340
- Just kind of felt like I
was going through the motions.

1308
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,520
I mean, in the middle of the sermon,

1309
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,910
everybody's jumping up and down.

1310
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,667
I'm sitting back wondering

1311
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,476
"When's the Falcon game start?"

1312
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:52,340
- Oh my God. You are terrible.

1313
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,500
- When we first started
going, I really liked it.

1314
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,333
And I've...

1315
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,330
- Oh, so you went to
church for some chick.

1316
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,991
So what happened to the chick

1317
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:07,282
you used to go to church with?

1318
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:08,115
- I don't know.

1319
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:09,090
She's around, I guess.

1320
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,376
- [Monet] She's around, you guess?

1321
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:12,560
- (laughs) You don't see
me diving on my phone

1322
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,840
every time it rings, do you?

1323
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,790
- Well, your phone's always on vibrate.

1324
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,390
- How do you know that?

1325
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:24,270
- I picked it up one time by mistake.

1326
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,690
- By mistake.

1327
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,683
- Yeah.

1328
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,640
- Where was I at?

1329
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,890
- You were in the shower.

1330
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,830
What?

1331
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:36,990
Why are you so nervous?

1332
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,540
What can I even do?

1333
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,890
It's not like you're my
man or anything, right?

1334
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,010
- True, true.

1335
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,503
But I still don't see why
you feel the need to check.

1336
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:51,080
I mean, you can ask me anything.

1337
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,930
I'll answer it honestly.

1338
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,030
- You're right.

1339
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:54,950
I am so sorry.

1340
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,815
I will never do that again.

1341
00:53:56,815 --> 00:53:58,400
(James laughs)

1342
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,997
- Yeah, right.

1343
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:01,230
- I'm not like that.

1344
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,060
If I gotta check up on you,
I'm gone like the wind.

1345
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:04,893
Believe me.

1346
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,707

but I don't see why you just can't stay.

- Nothing really.

1374
00:55:24,303 --> 00:55:26,298
We can talk about it tomorrow.

1375
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:28,298
- What are you thinking?

1376
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,090
(James laughs)

1377
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:35,025

1378
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:36,763
and it's no big deal, I'm serious.

1379
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,230
- Okay, but I'm here now.

1380
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,090
So tell me.

1381
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:44,275
- [Announcer On TV] Struck out 41

1382
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:47,149
and his 26th inning is pitched

1383
00:55:47,149 --> 00:55:49,303
giving up 12 hits in the process.

1384
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:51,823
- You know, I'm really glad I met you.

1385
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:55,380
- [Monet] I'm really glad I met you too.

1386
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,660
You're so sweet.

1387
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,940
- Sweet?

1388
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,350
What? Quit playing!

1389
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:03,060
What about sexy, strong, intelligent?

1390
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,893
- [Monet] Okay!

1391
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,711
- And not to mention, a
machine in bed. (laughs)

1392
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:11,357
- All of that, all of that.

1393
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,250
- Do you remember when
we were talking earlier

1394
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,760
and you asked me whose idea it was

1395
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,672
to go to the church I was attending?

1396
00:56:19,672 --> 00:56:21,089
- [Monet] Mm-hmm.

1397
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:27,850
- I wanna be honest with you.

1398
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,160
- [Monet] Jay, you don't
have to explain anything

1399
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,763
that happened in the past.

1400
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,240
- I was seeing someone

1401
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,583
and she got this great
job offer to New York.

1402
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,720
- You got a girlfriend?

1403
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,233
- [James] No, we broke up before she left.

1404
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,383
- So why didn't you tell
me about this before?

1405
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,340
How long were you guys together?

1406
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,253
- Three years.

1407
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,374
- So why are you just now telling me this?

1408
00:57:00,374 --> 00:57:01,890
- I don't want you to be upset.

1409
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,000
- The only reason why you would tell me

1410
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,750
about an ex-girlfriend is if
you're still in love with her

1411
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,980
or if you're lying to me

1412
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,813
and you're still with her.

1413
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:10,440
So which one is it?

1414
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,663
- We broke up.

1415
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,150
But she's coming home for Thanksgiving.

1416
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,983
- Home?

1417
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,650
Where's home? She live here?

1418
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,220
- [James] No.

1419
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,120
She's from Atlanta.

1420
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,403
Her family lives here.

1421
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,590
- We just had this
discussion earlier today.

1422
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,340
Why didn't you tell me
about that then, huh?

1423
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,830
Because you wanted what you wanted tonight

1424
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,810
and you knew that you wouldn't get it

1425
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,003
if you were to tell me the truth, right?

1426
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,740
- [James] No, I didn't plan
for it to go like this.

1427
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,573
- Yes, you did it.

1428
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:43,406
- Come on now.

1429
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:44,239
- Come on now?

1430
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,290
- Monet.

1431
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,173
- [Announcer On TV] Here in
the bottom half of the first.

1432
00:57:57,415 --> 00:58:00,332
(knocking on door)

1433
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:04,657
- Hey!
- Hey, you.

1434
00:58:04,657 --> 00:58:05,996
You look great. Come on in!

1435
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:07,692
- Thank you!

1436
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,600
I can't stay long.

1437
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,010
My ride is outside waiting.

1438
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,480
- Ride?

1439
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,870
Things must be working out for you.

1440
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,370
- Thanks to you.

1441
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,203
- Me?

1442
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:16,520
I mean, we haven't spoken in weeks.

1443
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,190
- And what about the video you did for me?

1444
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,730
- Oh, the video that all
of 100 people have seen?

1445
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,250
- Well, someone from
Safehouse Outreach saw it

1446
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,600
and when I applied for the position,

1447
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,520
they recognized me and
hired me on the spot.

1448
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,540
- What?
- Yes.

1449
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,930
I'm an assistant to the director.

1450
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:31,241
- [James] Oh, that's
great. Congratulations!

1451
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,760
You deserve it!
- Thank you. Thank you.

1452
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,310
There's more, but I have to go.

1453
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,010
My director went to college with her

1454
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,120
and she saw the video

1455
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,010
and wants you to call her, okay?

1456
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:41,843
I gotta go.

1457
00:58:41,843 --> 00:58:43,587
- [James] All right. You keep doing good.

1458
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:44,502
- Thank you.

1459
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:46,051
Hey, listen. Let me know
how that goes, okay?

1460
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:47,801
- I will.
- All right.

1461
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,093
(gentle music)

1462
00:59:17,881 --> 00:59:20,464
(smooth music)

1463
00:59:22,172 --> 00:59:23,315
- [Sanaa] May I?

1464
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:25,362
- [James] Yeah, why would you ask?

1465
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:26,864
- Just checking.

1466
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:28,596
- Can I get you something to drink?

1467
00:59:28,596 --> 00:59:29,544
- Do you have wine?

1468
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:30,532
- Of course.

1469
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:31,365
- [Sanaa] I'll take that.

1470
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:32,698
- Be right back.

1471
00:59:34,016 --> 00:59:36,516
(Sanaa sighs)

1472
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:44,920
Here you go.

1473
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,216
- Thank you.

1474
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:51,216
- So tell me all about New
York, this new job, all of it.

1475
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,393
- Brooklyn is lit.

1476
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,503
All the neighborhoods, and the people,

1477
00:59:56,503 --> 00:59:58,410
like they're completely different,

1478
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,137
but they're all right
next door to each other.

1479
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:00,970
So, yeah.

1480
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,010
And the restaurants
and the cafes, (sighs).

1481
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,520
But you spent time in Brooklyn.

1482
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,866
You know what I'm talking about.

1483
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:08,480
- Yeah, I always said
if I moved to New York,

1484
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,120
I'd probably live in Brooklyn.

1485
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,582
- Oh, well, you had your opportunity.

1486
01:00:12,582 --> 01:00:14,671
(Sanaa clears throat)

1487
01:00:14,671 --> 01:00:16,123
Anywho, how's your mother?

1488
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,190
- She's doing good.

1489
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,417
Matter of fact, she asked about you.

1490
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,660
- And what did you say?

1491
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,350
- I told her that you got a
great job offer in New York

1492
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,285
that you just couldn't refuse.

1493
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:28,830
- Did she ask you if we were together?

1494
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,882
- I told her that we keep
in contact, you know,

1495
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:32,820
and that we're still friends.

1496
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,080
- What, I've been gone for three months

1497
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,240
and we've only spoken like three times,

1498
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,090
today being included?

1499
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:40,930
I speak to my friends a little
bit more often than that.

1500
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,630
- Well, I have called
you, tried to text you,

1501
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,630
but if you don't respond, what can I do?

1502
01:00:46,507 --> 01:00:48,603
- Do you do this for all your friends?

1503
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,312
- [James] What?

1504
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:52,970
- This.

1505
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,410
The fireplace, the low lights,

1506
01:00:56,410 --> 01:01:00,133
chilled wine, the soft music.

1507
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,800
- No, I don't do this for everyone.

1508
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,740
And as a matter of fact, I got a surprise.

1509
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,600
Now, listen, obviously-

1510
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,513
- Jay, I need to talk to
you about something else.

1511
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:13,983
To be honest with you,

1512
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:14,816
I was planning on taking this

1513
01:01:14,816 --> 01:01:16,480
in a completely different direction.

1514
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,330
- Before we could even
talk about getting together

1515
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,353
or considering that, you
know we'd have to talk about-

1516
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,863
- Jay, I'm in love with someone else.

1517
01:01:34,876 --> 01:01:36,950
- I don't know what I was expecting,

1518
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,043
but I know I wasn't expecting that.

1519
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,140
- [Sanaa] I know I should
have said something,

1520
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,943
but I didn't wanna tell
you over the phone,

1521
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,580
even though I don't think
that you deserve the courtesy.

1522
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,475
- Why wouldn't I deserve the courtesy?

1523
01:01:53,475 --> 01:01:56,440
- I don't wanna go backwards here.

1524
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,640
I love him and he loves me.

1525
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,140
I didn't mean for this to
happen, but it just did.

1526
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,300
- You've been gone for
less than three months.

1527
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,600
How could you possibly have
fallen in love already?

1528
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,100
- I don't think you want me
to answer that, Jay, honestly.

1529
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,240
- Try me. Yeah, I would.

1530
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,400
- Well what he and I have
shared in three months,

1531
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,513
you and I we never
experienced in three years.

1532
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:25,130
You and I, we had something.

1533
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:25,963
Yeah.

1534
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,930
But it wasn't...

1535
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,859
It wasn't what I have now.

1536
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:33,190
And what I have now

1537
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,880
is something that I need and I want.

1538
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,310
- That's bullshit, Sanaa.

1539
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,190
I know you and I know how you operate.

1540
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,440
Ain't no way you're gonna let some dude

1541
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,570
get that close to you so quickly.

1542
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:45,380
- We spent a lot of time together.

1543
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,260
Look, I fell in love with someone else.

1544
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,210
It happens.

1545
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,390
People fall in love.

1546
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,250
People fall out of love.

1547
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,290
- So, on your mama's life,

1548
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,580
you gonna sit there and look me in my face

1549
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,750
and tell me that you done
fell in love with some cat

1550
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,100
in less than three months?

1551
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,410
- Okay, we met before I moved, but like,

1552
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,190
it wasn't anything, okay?

1553
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,803
It wasn't anything.
- Where'd you meet him?

1554
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,160
- Does it make a difference?

1555
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,993
- I mean, you might as well tell me.

1556
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,290
I don't see why you feel the need

1557
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,640
to lie to me at this point.

1558
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,710
- I met him while I was working here.

1559
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,890
He came to the Atlanta office for work

1560
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,700
and, I mean, that's when I met him

1561
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,950
but we didn't go out or anything, okay?

1562
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,200
- But he had your number.

1563
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,100
- I mean, we would talk about work.

1564
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,573
I mean, that was it.

1565
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:30,603
- Wait a minute.

1566
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:33,460
Is this the guy who told you

1567
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:36,030

1569

- Damn.

1571
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,870
You know what? I can't even be mad at him.

1572
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:46,950
Talk about laying the foundation.

1573
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,410
I bet bro probably had it
mapped out from the start.

1574
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:53,510
- Jay, I just-
- You know what? I got it.

1575
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,343

1579
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,673
- [Sanaa] Okay.

1580
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,480
- [James] After that, I felt like

1581
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,290
I needed to hit the streets.

1582
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,850
I figured I hit a club and chill

1583
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:19,650
with some of the beautiful
women this city has to offer.

1584
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,770
The problem was, deep down,

1585
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,300
I wasn't really in the mood.

1586
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,097

01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,750
of saying the wrong
thing at the wrong time,

1593
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,690
is the fact that when I'm
thinking about something deeply,

1594
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,680
I sometimes ignore the obvious,

1595
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,140
which can lead to trouble,

- What were you doing
down there that late?

1644
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:22,602
- I told you.

1645
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:25,400
I was just doing some
driving around thinking

1646
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,140
and I ran out of gas.

1647
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,550
- Prostitutes and Johns are

1648
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,850
usually the only ones
down there at that time.

1649
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,333
- What?

1650
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,310
- So the next time you have an argument

1651
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,143
with one of your girlfriends,

1652
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,950
why don't you try driving around Buckhead

1653
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,040
or maybe at least
somewhere that's well lit.

1654
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,040
- All right.

1655
01:06:58,285 --> 01:07:00,200
- I'm gonna get this filled for you.

1656
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,920
- Thanks, Uncle.
(doorbell rings)

1657
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,753
- I'll get that.

1658
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,124
- Hi, I'm Monet.

1659
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,410
I was wondering if I could
see Jay for a minute.

1660
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,727
- Sure, come on in.
- Thank you.

1661
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:16,317
- [Tony] Close this door.

1662
01:07:16,317 --> 01:07:17,150
- [Monet] Thank you.

1663
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,060
- [Tony] I'm Jay's Uncle Tony.

1664
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,710
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you also.

1665
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,740
He's right in here.

1666
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,413
- Hey.

1667
01:07:33,293 --> 01:07:34,870
- How are you feeling?

1668
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,390
- [James] I'm all right.

1669
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,443
Just a concussion.

1670
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,130
- Jay, I can see you're in good hands.

1671
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:42,910
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna take off.

1672
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:43,810
It was nice meeting you.

1673
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,900
- Nice meeting you too.

1674
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,760
- Thanks, Unc.

1675
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,427
So thanks for coming by.

1676
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:50,840
You wanna have a seat

1677
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,563
or I can take your coat, you know?

1678
01:07:54,263 --> 01:07:55,763
- No, I'm not gonna stay long.

1679
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,188
I just came by to check on you

1680
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:00,738
and see if you needed anything.

1681
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,390
- [James] I'm all right.

1682
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,204
- I have to be honest.

1683
01:08:05,204 --> 01:08:06,160
I wasn't even sure I was gonna

1684
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,810
answer the phone when you called.

1685
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,493
I wasn't sure when you were
gonna hear from me again,

1686
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,130
but I could tell from
the sound of your voice

1687
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,730
that something was really wrong.

1688
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,603
Do you need anything?

1689
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,710
- I'm all right, I guess.

1690
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:31,087
- [Monet] You need a
prescription filled or?

1691
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,550
- No, my uncle already took care of that.

1692
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,800
- Did you eat?

1693
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,633
- [James] Yeah.

1694
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,960
- Okay, well, since you
don't need anything,

1695
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,810
I guess I'll just go.

1696
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,373
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1697
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,930
I don't have everything I need.

1698
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,130
- What do you need, Jay?

1699
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,673
- You.

1700
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,360
- Moving women around like chess pieces

1701
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,893
for your enjoyment is not a need.

1702
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:11,683
- I wanted to be honest with you.

1703
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:13,850
I wanted to be sure I was over her

1704
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,360
before we went any further.

1705
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,100
- You come across as disingenuous

1706
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,740
and you talk about being honest

1707
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,103
after you intentionally
withheld the truth?

1708
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,743
All that matters is what Jay wants, right?

1709
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,183
- No.

1710
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,920
Just give me another opportunity, Monet.

1711
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,973
- No, I'm gone.

1712
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,083
- [James] Monet.

1713
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:50,805
(door slams)

1714
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:01,350
- Let's get started.

1715
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,570
All Texas licenses have to be renewed

1716
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,720
by the end of the week.

1717
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,030
I take it you all have the required

1718
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:10,051
continuing education hours.

1719
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:12,062
(tense music)

1720
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:13,450
What is the problem?

1721
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,870
You're all professionals.

1722
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,570
Why do you wait till the last minute?

1723
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:18,490
- Some of us have families.

1724
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,770
- I assigned a time management module

1725
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:23,430
and to date none of
y'all have completed it.

1726
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,970
If you took your career seriously,

1727
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:25,980
you would have completed it

1728
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,963
and implemented but you aren't.

1729
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,820
- Why are you speaking
to us like we're kids?

1730
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:33,230
- Maybe because our
customer service results

1731
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,683
are the worst in the company.

1732
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,720
We get more home office complaints

1733
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,070
than any other region.

1734
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:42,660
And as result, I get a
call from the home office

1735
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,633
ripping me a new one on a weekly basis.

1736
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,710
- They send us questionnaires

1737
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,429
to one out of every 25 policy holders.

1738
01:10:49,429 --> 01:10:50,490
- It doesn't matter.

1739
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,550
Our results are the worst in the company.

1740
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,980
- You know, I got one of those last week

1741
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:57,500
from a guy who totaled
out a 2002 Ford F150.

1742
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,320
We had the value at $6,350,

1743
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,390
but he valued it $15,000

1744
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,540
because he put a new set of tires on it

1745
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,410
and he got a brand new paint job.

1746
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,940
So what do you think he's gonna say

1747
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,080
when somebody asks him about his claim?

1748
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,210
- You're not the only one

1749
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,870
that settles total losses.

1750
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,703
Let me repeat.

1751
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,650
Our results are the worst in the company.

1752
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,483
Fix it.

1753
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,680
All right.

1754
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,080
Last thing.

1755
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,480
Take one and pass it down.

1756
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:00,400
As you can see, this
is a policy endorsement

1757
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,890
that was effective the
first of last month.

1758
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:05,050
- So why are we just
hearing about this now?

1759
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:05,883
Based on this,

1760
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:07,400
I told somebody something
that wasn't true.

1761
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,950
We should have known about this.

1762
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,560
- We need to do what's required by-

1763
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,710
- Sharon, you just sat up in here

1764
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,020
and said we had issues
with customer service.

1765
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,030
So what does it say about customer service

1766
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:17,350
when we broaden the coverage

1767
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,683
but we can't tell them so
they can take advantage of it?

1768
01:12:19,683 --> 01:12:21,926
- I just became aware of it myself.

1769
01:12:21,926 --> 01:12:23,203
That's why we're having this meeting.

1770
01:12:23,203 --> 01:12:24,740
- This is bullshit.

1771
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,680
- Watch your language.

1772
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,870
- You know, you bring us in here

1773
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,610
and tell us how poorly
of a job we're doing

1774
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,350
like we're supposed to sit
up in here and take it.

1775
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,507
It's insulting.

1776
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:32,573
- It sounds like an intentional move

1777
01:12:32,573 --> 01:12:34,591
from the executive office to me.

1778
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:35,743
- It wasn't.

1779
01:12:35,743 --> 01:12:37,480
- You know, if the insurance
department found out,

1780
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,370
we could get hit with a pretty heavy fine

1781
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:41,870
or maybe even be prevented
from writing the policies.

1782
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,790
This is a big effin' deal.

1783
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,903
- It is not our job to worry about it.

1784
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,730
That's all I have.

1785
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,060
- I'm taking a leave of absence.

1786
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,242
- This is a joke, right?

1787
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:04,440
- No.

1788
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,360
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1789
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,260
You just got back from vacation.

1790
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,220
- And I'm taking a leave of absence.

1791
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,133
- You got a set on you, you know that?

1792
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,300
Meet me in the conference
room after lunch.

1793
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:25,210
I said in the conference room after lunch.

1794
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,043
What part of that do you not-

1795
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:27,870
- I've worked here for nine years

1796
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,210
as a senior claims specialist.

1797
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,730
I even interned two summers
here when I was in college.

1798
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:34,400
I've gone along with the
changes this company has made

1799
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,390
in an effort to keep up
with our competitors.

1800
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,223
And you know what?

1801
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:39,280
You owe me nine years and two summers.

1802
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,240
Because the arrogance
displayed by this company

1803
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,110
is only eclipsed by the absurdity

1804
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:46,320
and selfishness of its decision making.

1805
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,300
And you know what?

1806
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,260
I fear that it's contagious

1807
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,980
and that I've taken years off my life

1808
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,260
by breathing the air that
circulates in this building.

1809
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,900
So you know what?

1810
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,550
I'm not giving you a two
weeks notice because I quit.

1811
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,033
- Yo, where are you going?

1812
01:14:03,033 --> 01:14:04,280
- I'm out, Steve.

1813
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,230
I'll call you, man.

1814
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,970
It's amazing what you
see when you slow down

1815
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:07,573
and just allow yourself to be.

1816
01:15:09,058 --> 01:15:11,891
(uplifting music)

1817
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:17,630
- What motivated you to tell this story?

1818
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,150
- Well, I can tell you
that it wasn't planned.

1819
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,220
I actually was headed
into a convenience store.

1820
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,780
It had already been a
long day and I was tired.

1821
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:27,613
And you know how it is,

1822
01:16:27,613 --> 01:16:29,653
I wasn't exactly in the best of moods.

1823
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,510
And I was about to head
into the convenience store

1824
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:36,360
and this young woman just approached me.

1825
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,930
That meeting turned into a job

1826
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,570
producing special projects for CNN.

1827
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,820
Don't ignore that little
voice in your head.

1828
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,800
That's your conscience talking to you.

1829
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,430
Once you realize that,

1830
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,910
the next step is to figure out

1831
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,217
what you're supposed to do

1832
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:51,400
and how you're supposed to do it.

1833
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,990
I like to write and document what I see.

1834
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,050
I wanna do that in a way

1835
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:57,130
that informs and helps other people

1836
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,120
because in the end,

1837
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,310
helping other people is all that matters.

1838
01:17:07,726 --> 01:17:10,309
