1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:05,890
The San Fernando Valley,
16 miles north of Los Angeles

2
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:31,656
<i>You're killing me, girl... what
happened with you and Josh?</i>

3
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:37,308
Help!

4
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:58,761
So... I understand that you all were
part of the 58th Rescue Squadron

5
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,232
staged over at Bagram in Afghanistan

6
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:02,476
Combat, Search and Rescue.

7
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,047
Yes ma'am.
2 tours.

8
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:05,469
And yet still flying together?

9
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:06,868
Yeah, we all got pretty tight over there.

10
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,500
We wouldn't want to break up the family.

11
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,116
Dude, do we look like a family?

12
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,383
A little.

13
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,646
So what is the biggest difference
between rescuing over there...

14
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:17,555
and what you do here?

15
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,594
Not getting shot at.

16
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,050
You're a funny guy.

17
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,488
Yeah, exactly.

18
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,337
Cute not bright.

19
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,369
Chief Gaines.

20
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,788
I'm told that between Afghanistan and LFD...

21
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,473
you have over 600 documented rescues.

22
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:35,256
That's uh...
pretty impressive.

23
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,376
Just doing my job, ma'am.

24
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,520
I go where they tell me to go.

25
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,715
That's great.
Cut the...

26
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,324
There she is.

27
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,701
Looks pretty tight.

28
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,150
Take her up.

29
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,044
Metro, this is LFD helo 5,
we're on cedar cliff V rescue.

30
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,973
- We have visual.
<i>- Copy Helo 5.</i>

31
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,660
What's the girl's name?

32
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,259
Natalie.

33
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,187
Metro, connect her cell to our Sat phone.

34
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:34,475
<i>Helo 5, you're connected.</i>

35
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,082
Hello.

36
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:40,953
<i>Natalie, this is chief pilot Raymond Gaines,
from the Los Angeles Fire Department</i>

37
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:43,846
<i>I'm piloting the chopper above you.
You holding up alright?</i>

38
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,839
I don't know.
I'm not feeling very well.

39
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:50,461
Oh my god!
The car is sliding.

40
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,718
<i>Natalie, I'm gonna need
you to stay calm honey.</i>

41
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:55,324
- <i>We're coming to get you, okay</i>
- Okay.

42
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,318
Ray, I don't see a way in.

43
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,397
We're going to tip the hat.

44
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,974
- Tip the hat?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,842
You might want to hold on to something.

46
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,558
Here we go.

47
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,110
15 feet up.

48
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:25,012
10 feet.

49
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,341
5!

50
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:29,615
Whoa!
Go easy Ray.

51
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:33,191
Rise and shine.

52
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:41,833
Alright.
Tuck it in, boys.

53
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,036
Joby, forget the basket.

54
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:49,750
We got to do a double tie-in
on this time.

55
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:52,039
If that car goes, so does she.

56
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,838
<i>The door's open</i>

57
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,475
<i>Hooking up.</i>

58
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,401
On the skid.

59
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,523
We got 5 minutes max.

60
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,274
What happens in 5 minutes?

61
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,656
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

62
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,766
<i>Just engines failure.</i>

63
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,405
<i>Good thing I only need 3.</i>

64
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:35,210
No! Don't.
Natalie, do not move!

65
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,789
Oh my god.
Get me out of here.

66
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,180
Natalie, I need you to stay perfectly still.

67
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,453
I have to stabilize the car, okay?

68
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:41,609
Hurry, please.

69
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:53,149
Hoist secured.

70
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:01,580
Got it.

71
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,029
What the hell?

72
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,718
Shit.

73
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:14,205
Oh, no.

74
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,061
Jesus.

75
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,545
Joby's pinned.

76
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,873
Oh, god damn it.

77
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:34,825
Joby.
I'm coming down.

78
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,884
Harrison, you're flying.

79
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,300
- Marcus, rig me a rope.
- Alright.

80
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,428
- Handing over.
- Taking over.

81
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,559
- Get ready to cut.
- Roger that.

82
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,430
Hooked up.

83
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,245
Out the door.

84
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:58,656
<i>Ray's cleared.</i>

85
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:10,886
Natalie, don't you worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here...

86
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,981
This thing isn't going to hold!

87
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:20,985
Ray, we are in red.
We're going to crash.

88
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,557
Natalie, we're going now!

89
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:27,512
Okay, I got you.

90
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:28,587
Cut it!

91
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,403
Cutting sling!

92
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,986
Yeah.

93
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,792
What do you say we get you home now?

94
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,206
I think that's a really good idea.

95
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:54,777
California Institute of Technology (Caltech)

96
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:56,441
Now, the Sendai quake in Japan

97
00:07:56,465 --> 00:08:00,522
was considered to be one of the
5 strongest since 1900s.

98
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,933
It was so powerful in fact that
it moved to the main island of Japan...

99
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,087
8 feet.

100
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:12,299
This is just...
1 of the 1.3 million earthquakes

101
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,112
that occur around the globe each year

102
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:18,238
The largest ever recorded
here in North America.

103
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:23,253
Anchorage, Alaska - 1964,
a 9.1

104
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,479
The earth shook for 5 straight minutes.

105
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,507
The energy released was the
equivalent of 10 million atom bombs

106
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:34,325
the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.

107
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,411
And that's not the biggest
earthquake ever recorded.

108
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,837
No.
The biggest was 4 years eariler.

109
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:41,497
Off the coast of Valdivia,
in southern Chile,

110
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,337
a 9.5 on the Richter scale.

111
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:46,261
Right there.

112
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,829
Bam.

113
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,346
This quake lasted 11 minutes.

114
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:53,784
And spawned a tsunami 82 feet high

115
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:57,596
that leveled Hilo-Hawaii,
8 thousand miles away.

116
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,417
8000 miles away.

117
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,235
So...
uh...

118
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,721
It's...

119
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:07,895
It's mass destruction like this...

120
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:11,841
that shows how important that the
research we are doing here... is.

121
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:14,146
Because we need to be able
to predict these things.

122
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:15,082
Right?

123
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:17,051
To plan and prepare for them.
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:20,366
Professor, do you think something
that intense can happen here?

125
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:24,421
Well, the San Andreas Fault
runs up the spine of California.

126
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:28,172
That's the demarcation line
between 2 tectonic plates that are...

127
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,298
constantly moving.

128
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:35,026
Add to that, the fact that
it's suppose to happen every 150 years.

129
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:38,581
And we're about 100 years overdue.

130
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:41,502
I say it's not a matter of "if".

131
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,980
It's a matter of when?

132
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:50,626
Damn, Godzilla. What the hell
did you do to her this time?

133
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,362
Played a little tug or war with.

134
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,842
How soon could you get her fixed?

135
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:55,363
I'll call Martinez today.

136
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,604
Get another one send over to maintenance.

137
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,254
Elgin, you move any faster,
you're going to break that hip.

138
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:04,634
Harrison said you're taking off
with Blake for a few days.

139
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:07,944
Yeah, leaving tomorrow.
Driving back up to school.

140
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,836
Volleyball team has her
first game this weekend.

141
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:12,503
So I figure we cruise up
the coast and go camping.

142
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,600
Dude, I can't believe
she's in college already.

143
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,955
I know.

144
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,401
Too fast brother.

145
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,360
- I'll catch you inside.
- Alright.

146
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,553
CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY

147
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,147
- Lawrence, I got to show you something.
- Yeah.

148
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,640
Uh-huh.
Jesus.

149
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,404
Now we got a rare low level seismic
swarming out from Falcon, Nevada.

150
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,479
23 small earthquakes.
All tiny 2 to 2.6.

151
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,529
In the last 24 hours.

152
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,478
Where the hell is Falcon, Nevada?

153
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,857
35 miles south east of Vegas maybe.

154
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,135
- 5 miles from Hoover Dam.
- Fine.

155
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,715
There aren't any faults out there.

156
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,119
Any known faults.

157
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,413
Now if we get there while
the mini quakes continue.

158
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,876
We can test our theory.

159
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,175
And if the magnetic pulse rate
goes up before the quakes...

160
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,459
- And we'll predict them now.
- And we'll predict them now.

161
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:02,646
Alright.
Let's go check it out.

162
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,576
<i>- Hi, Dad.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

163
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,553
I was wondering if there's room for my bike?

164
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,132
I thought that I could ride it to class,

165
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,025
and I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.

166
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,483
It is a great idea.

167
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,596
I'm sure I could figure out
a way to fit it in.

168
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:35,497
<i>Alright, great. I can't find
the key to the lock at mom's, so...</i>

169
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:38,283
<i>it's either in the top
left drawer of my dresser or...</i>

170
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,632
<i>on top of the wardrobe in the pink shoe box.</i>

171
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:42,407
Okay, no problem.
I'll find it.

172
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:45,592
I don't know If you have plans tonight
but I love to take you to dinner.

173
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,887
You can invite your mother along.
It'll be fun.

174
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:52,137
<i>Thanks, Dad, but we already
have plans with Daniel.</i>

175
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:55,542
Dad.

176
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:57,933
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah, of course I am.</i>

177
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,080
Totally cool.
No problem at all.

178
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:01,230
<i>Okay.</i>

179
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:02,989
- <i>I'll see you tomorrow then.</i>
- Okay.

180
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,828
Oh, and don't forget the bike key.

181
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,565
<i>I won't, I got it.</i>

182
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,098
- Bye, dad. I love you.
<i>- Okay, I love you too honey.</i>

183
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:10,342
Bye.

184
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:21,385
DIVORCE PAPERS ATTACHED

185
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,445
Hoover Dam

186
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,174
Hoover Dam Clark County, Nevada

187
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,806
Lawrence, it's incredible.

188
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,017
This is the 3rd mini quake
since we've been here.

189
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,606
And the magnetic pulse rate is
increased before each one of them...

190
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,319
<i>We've got a pattern, my friend</i>.

191
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,302
That was 2.2

192
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,117
Our model is predictive.

193
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:09,351
Finally we got it right, man.
Finally!

194
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:11,576
Yup, we sure did.

195
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,480
Shit.

196
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:18,800
What's wrong?

197
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,394
The pulse rates are spiking again.
They're huge.

198
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,364
<i>Are you serious?</i>

199
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,773
<i>Kim?</i>

200
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,203
We're about to have a major quake.

201
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,080
It jumped to a 7.1

202
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:38,955
Jesus, Kim.
Get the hell out of there!

203
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,985
Everybody, get off the dam!

204
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:49,970
Move, now! Now!

205
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:56,986
Go girls!

206
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,588
Go, go, go.

207
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:01,203
Everybody off!
Hurry up!

208
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,728
Stay behind the barriers!

209
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:35,252
Come on, run!
Stay behind the barriers.

210
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:36,830
Someone help!

211
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:43,230
Kim!
Hurry!

212
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:48,509
Come here.
I got you.

213
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,277
Come on, please.

214
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:58,147
Oh my god!

215
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:02,504
Kim!

216
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,224
Hurry up!

217
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,311
Lawrence!

218
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,915
No.

219
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:25,536
Kim!

220
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:27,457
No, no!

221
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,216
Close your eyes.

222
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,682
- Oh god.
- Mommy.

223
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:20,471
Chief Logan Large earthquake, Nevada...

224
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:24,059
Chief Logan Large earthquake, Nevada.
Call in immediately.

225
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,553
<i>The southern part of Nevada was robbed today</i>

226
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,115
<i>by what seismologists could call...</i>

227
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,160
<i>"The most destructive earthquake
ever reported in that area. "</i>

228
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:35,199
<i>Officials are saying that
Hoover Dam, is a total lost.</i>

229
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:40,211
<i>Lake Havasu City,
also suffered major damage.</i>

230
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,032
<i>...begin arriving in the next 24 hours.</i>

231
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:51,981
Hi Dad.

232
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,487
- Hey, honey.
- I just saw the news.

233
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:56,562
I know.
I'm so sorry.

234
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:57,629
We're heading out tomorrow.

235
00:17:57,654 --> 00:17:59,904
I get it. It sounds really bad, dad.

236
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,701
Yeah.
This one is tough.

237
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:06,549
Hey, Emm.

238
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,538
Hey.

239
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:11,262
- Good to see you.
- You too.

240
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:14,011
- Daniel.
- Ray. Good to finally meet you.

241
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:16,109
It's good to meet you too.
Heck of a place you got here, man.

242
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:17,665
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

243
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,997
So... um.
Dad is heading to Nevada tomorrow.

244
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:24,168
Oh, it's terrible what happened.
Please be safe with them, okay.

245
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,933
Yeah, we will. And I promise,
I will make it up to you honey.

246
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,532
Dad, it's really no problem.

247
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,860
The drive's not...

248
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,824
Wait, why don't I take you up there?

249
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,725
I'm flying up to San Francisco
for a meeting...

250
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,804
we can head up to Seattle right after.

251
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:37,885
It'll give me an opportunity to
catch your volleyball game.

252
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,184
Good idea.

253
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,176
And it'll give your mom
a chance to get all her stuff

254
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:43,276
and move in without me in the way.

255
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,968
Right you are.

256
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,657
You guys moving in?

257
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,145
Yeah, I... I was meaning to tell you,
but we didn't have a chance to...

258
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,828
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

259
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,503
Thanks.

260
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,954
That's great.

261
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,703
- Call me when you get there.
- I will.

262
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,837
- Alright.
- I love you, Dad.

263
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:11,505
- And becareful too.
- I will, I will. I love you too.

264
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,234
I'll get her bike.

265
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,471
I'm sorry you guys can't
go up there together.

266
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,074
Yeah, me too.

267
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,478
Ray.

268
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:23,493
Ray.

269
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:26,271
I was going to tell you.

270
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,459
We just decided to do it.

271
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:35,424
Don't worry about it.

272
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:41,702
- Hey, if you want...
- And I'll get those papers signed for you too.

273
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,171
<i>It was a Sunday afternoon</i>

274
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:08,272
<i>Obviously, people weren't at work.
They were asleep.</i>

275
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:10,875
<i>Even so, the early devastation
has spared no...</i>

276
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,154
This is bad.

277
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,822
Yeah.

278
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:15,845
What time we're heading out?

279
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,018
14:30

280
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:18,709
The guys are preping the gears now.

281
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,992
Alright.
Let's get to work.

282
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:23,841
<i>...clearly sophisticated rescue
operations are on the way</i>

283
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:26,646
So this Daniel guy is taking Blake now?

284
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:28,610
I would've call in sick.

285
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,437
Well, that's why I'm the boss
and you're not.

286
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,711
Oh, pretty sure we could
manage a few days without you.

287
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,547
- Shoes untied.
- Ha-ha-ha...

288
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:38,821
Are you kidding me.

289
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,350
Eah...

290
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,245
Blake.

291
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,507
I want you to know that I respect

292
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,483
what you and your dad have.

293
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:04,130
And to know your mom moving in
has to feel like a pretty big step.

294
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:07,186
But I'm never going to try and
change with what you have with him.

295
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,424
Or, take his place.
Okay.

296
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,064
Yeah.

297
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:14,399
Okay.
Cool.

298
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,735
Hey, how come you never have kids?

299
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,450
Oh, I did.

300
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,455
This is one of them right here.

301
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,728
She's a pretty nice addition to
the San Francisco skyline.

302
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:26,769
Don't you think?

303
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:28,868
- The Gate
- Catchy.

304
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,791
Yeah, I like it.

305
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:32,892
Mom was telling me about this.

306
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,196
She said it's the tallest
building in the city, right?

307
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:40,429
When it's finished, it will be the tallest,
strongest and it's already 80% sold.

308
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:43,046
But honestly...

309
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:47,857
I guess I never had any kids because
I was always so busy raising these.

310
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,751
Oakland Municipal Airport

311
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:57,005
Mom texted, she's having
lunch with your sister today.

312
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,407
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days.
Emm really wanted to meet her.

313
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:01,711
I'm a little nervous though.

314
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,971
Susan can be kind of... overprotective.

315
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,141
Oh, thank you.

316
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:18,346
San Francisco

317
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,902
Jonathan.

318
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,126
- Morning, Mr. Riddick
- Morning.

319
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:52,526
- You're going to be okay, Blake?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

320
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:01,795
Hi.

321
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,417
Hello.

322
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,390
Sorry Lawrence.
Can I get you anything?

323
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,337
No.
I'm fine Alexi, thank you.

324
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,023
Are you sure you want to be here?

325
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:27,417
I can use the distraction, actually.

326
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:28,737
Yeah?

327
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,450
There's a reporter outside.

328
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:33,226
Says she's doing a segment in
what happened in Nevada.

329
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:34,815
Oh.

330
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:38,952
I'm going to her this is not a good time.

331
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:41,269
No, wait a minute.

332
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,381
Kim gave his life for this.

333
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:46,906
People need to know that
we can predict these things now.

334
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:53,013
You want a copy?

335
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:55,371
I've got a 1,000 in storage.

336
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:58,263
No one listens to us until
the ground shakes, I guess.

337
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:00,712
You know, they told me
what happened to your colleague.

338
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,612
You don't have to do this now.

339
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,451
Yeah, we do.

340
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,002
We're good to go.

341
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,491
- Okay.
- Okay.

342
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,121
Rolling.

343
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,661
First question: How come no one saw
what happened in Nevada coming?

344
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,379
Because we didn't know
there were any fault lines out there.

345
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:19,000
Why not?

346
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,153
Contrary to popular believes,
scientists don't know everything.

347
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:26,208
I understand that you publicly
stated that someday...

348
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,687
scientists would be able
to predict earthquakes.

349
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:30,488
Well actually, as of yesterday,

350
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:32,516
we now believe that we can predict them.

351
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,866
Professor.

352
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:37,896
Talk to you for a second.

353
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:40,444
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

354
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:42,530
What is it?

355
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,744
Current pulse rates of
the monitoring stations.

356
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,392
All along the San Andreas Fault.

357
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:48,494
Their averages are spiking from 82 to 85,

358
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,077
but the biggest jump
is coming from San Francisco.

359
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:53,392
More than 20 points higher
than what we saw in Nevada.

360
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,001
No, no, no, no.
Let's not panic.

361
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,026
We checked.

362
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,853
- We double checked.
- Henry and Sally has them run triple check.

363
00:24:58,878 --> 00:25:00,695
Those are the counts.

364
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:04,213
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

365
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,101
Okay.
Uh.

366
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:10,965
If...

367
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,968
If we draw a line...

368
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:18,585
from San Andreas up to Hoover Dam.

369
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,995
It almost literally follows
the Colorado River,

370
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:25,343
which is a natural deformation event.

371
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,208
And geologically...

372
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,837
deformation events, marked boundaries.

373
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:34,542
They marked boundaries.

374
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,717
So what if...

375
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,383
What if this...

376
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:43,828
whole chunk of land is
connected to our tectonic plate.

377
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:44,903
That would tell us that,

378
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:48,358
what happened yesterday
in Nevada was not an anomaly.

379
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:54,267
No. What if it was a precursor movement

380
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:58,578
along the leading edge of the
plate boundary fault from Los Angeles

381
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,853
all the way up to San Francisco.

382
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:04,631
Are you saying, you think the whole
San Andreas Fault, might go off?

383
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,770
Yes, that is exactly what I am saying.

384
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,591
Who should we call?

385
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:13,816
Everybody.

386
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:20,768
Oh, bloody hell.

387
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,175
I have something.
Here.

388
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:26,491
Completely idiot.

389
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,875
Thank you, very much.
That's very kind of you.

390
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,967
Yeah, no problem.

391
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:34,463
Uh, I'm Blake by the way.

392
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:36,060
Oh yeah, I'm...
I'm Blake.

393
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:37,926
Hello Blake.
I'm Ben.

394
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,027
Ben Taylor is my name.

395
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:42,067
- Please to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

396
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:44,504
So, is that your father you came in with?

397
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:46,095
Daniel Riddick?

398
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,912
Uh, he's my mom's boyfriend.

399
00:26:47,937 --> 00:26:48,975
Ah.

400
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,407
Are you meeting with him?

401
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:51,885
Oh no, I'm...

402
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,309
I'm... not even close.

403
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,447
I wish.
I'm interviewing for a job here.

404
00:26:57,472 --> 00:27:02,136
Mr. Riddick is the...
boss of the boss, of the boss

405
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:03,637
that I'll be working for.

406
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:06,476
So uh... What kind of job
are you interviewing for?

407
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,030
Anything in engineering or design.

408
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:10,356
I'm not picky or proud.
I just...

409
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,677
I just want to work here.

410
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:16,021
If you are an architect,
this is the... place to be.

411
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,180
Hi, I'm Ollie.

412
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,894
He's my brother.

413
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,231
Hi, it's nice to meet you Ollie.
I'm Blake.

414
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:25,789
You know, you're quite beautiful.

415
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:27,124
Why, thank you.

416
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:29,343
Ollie, did you, did you...
Sorry.

417
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,537
You remember what we discussed.

418
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,130
Sit still and no talking.

419
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:35,291
It is not normal to bring
little brothers to job interviews.

420
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:38,617
So let's stop.
It's embarrassing, okay.

421
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:42,913
Do you mind if I get
your phone number for him?

422
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:44,764
Ollie!
That's exactly...

423
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,110
What?
You'll never ask for it.

424
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:50,545
And then I'll have to listen how much
you regretted not getting it.

425
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,791
- I...
- Mr Taylor.

426
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:54,483
Ms. Carter will see you now.

427
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,185
Thank you.

428
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,318
I, uh...

429
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:02,146
- I...
- Good luck.

430
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,367
Thank you.
You...

431
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,646
sit here and don't say another word.

432
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:12,343
- Hi. I'm Ben.
- Hello.

433
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:15,947
- We're going head straight over to security.
- Excellent.

434
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,958
What do you want to talk about?

435
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,011
- Where're you from?
- England.

436
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,377
Ben thought that while our parents
were going together on a cruise.

437
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,365
He and I should take a holiday in the city,

438
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,592
after his interview.

439
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,884
- Awesome.
- Oh.

440
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,567
Would you like to hear our itinerary?

441
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:36,487
Los Angeles

442
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,386
Susan.
It's nice to finally to meet you.

443
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:52,198
You, as well.

444
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,606
If Daniel asked you to move in with him.

445
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,192
Things must be pretty serious.

446
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:58,358
Yes

447
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:01,446
Hi, I'm Larissa.
I'll be taking care of you today.

448
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:02,950
Can I tell you about our specials?

449
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,051
Please, I love to hear it.

450
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,375
Actually, could you come back
in a few minutes, Larissa.

451
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,455
Yeah.
Sure.

452
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:12,864
So...

453
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,448
I understand you've been married before.

454
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,081
Uh, yes.

455
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:18,909
And you have just the 1 daughter, right?

456
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,068
Right.

457
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,750
Your other one drowned in an accident?

458
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:26,814
Yes, to put it bluntly.

459
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,339
- Oh, I didn't mean it like that...
- Uh.

460
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,478
Could you just give me a moment.

461
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,355
Hi.
Everything okay?

462
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,512
<i>Yeah.</i>

463
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:42,030
<i>Oh, I'm on my way to maintenance
before we head out and...</i>

464
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,125
Am I interrupting anything?

465
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:45,610
Nothing important.

466
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:46,746
What's going on?

467
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:50,993
Look, I just... I wanted to tell you
I was sorry for how I acted yesterday.

468
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:53,946
- No Ray, really.
<i>- No Emma</i>

469
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:57,958
I just wasn't ready to hear about you
and Blake moving in with someone else.

470
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:00,676
I should have told you before.

471
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:02,397
And how's Blake feel about it?

472
00:30:02,422 --> 00:30:05,115
<i>You know, she likes us to be a family again</i>.

473
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,189
I think it's going to be hard for her.

474
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,327
Get back.

475
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:17,977
Emma.

476
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:21,345
- Emma?
- Oh god. We have an earthquake.

477
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,717
<i>Oh Jesus, Ray.
I got to get out of here.</i>

478
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,265
Where are you?

479
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,071
Shit, at the top floor.

480
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:32,370
<i>Emma, listen. Get as many people
as you can, and get to the roof.</i>

481
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,304
I'm in the helo and
I'll get you from there, okay.

482
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,204
- Okay, okay...
- Okay. Get to the roof, honey.

483
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:44,023
Oh, no, no...

484
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,895
Under the table.

485
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:48,535
Drop, cover and hold on.

486
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:56,283
Lawrence, the rate just jumped
from 6.5 to a 8.5

487
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:58,664
- What does that mean?
- Powers of 10th.

488
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,125
So it's a hundred times stronger now.

489
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,133
Don't worry. Caltech is probably
the safest place to be right now.

490
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:08,721
Professor, looks like the whole
San Andreas Fault line is being activated.

491
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,563
And it's heading towards San Francisco.

492
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:14,894
Alright, we're all done.

493
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:16,444
Okay.

494
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:21,313
Well, it's really nice to meet you, Ollie.

495
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,752
I hope you have fun while you're here.

496
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:25,189
Bye Blake.
It's nice meeting you as well.

497
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:26,086
Goodbye.

498
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:28,544
Oh, and uh...
I almost forgot.

499
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:32,130
Do you mind if I borrow
your book for a second?

500
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:41,035
Tell Ben that I'll help anybody
who work for him.

501
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:48,221
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:53,308
I can't wait to be 20.

503
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:00,766
Thank you.

504
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,847
It's an earthquake.

505
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:22,580
Well, go, go, go.
Get us out of here.

506
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,669
Oh god.

507
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,706
Look out!

508
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:35,236
Aw!

509
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,578
That's it.
Go, go, go!

510
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,273
Jesus Christ!

511
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:45,307
Aww...!

512
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:48,061
Oh shit!

513
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,814
My LEG!

514
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:10,103
Are you okay?

515
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:13,105
Oh my god.
He's... He's dead!

516
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,615
Blake.

517
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,919
Blake, Blake.

518
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,137
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

519
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:21,274
Yeah.
No.

520
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:23,078
No. I don't think.

521
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:24,779
I don't think so.

522
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:27,288
But my legs are stuck.

523
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,398
My leg.

524
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,866
- Push.
- Come on.

525
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,143
Okay.

526
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,577
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

527
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:49,938
Oh god.

528
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,208
Okay.

529
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:53,556
Think.
Think.

530
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:06,673
Daniel?

531
00:34:08,302 --> 00:34:09,811
Blake, I'm gonna go for help.

532
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,112
- No, Daniel. No.
- I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

533
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:15,105
Daniel, don't.
Please don't leave me alone.

534
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,451
Daniel.

535
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:17,864
Don't take too...

536
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:22,084
Come on, help me.

537
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,688
- Help!
- Keep moving. Keep moving.

538
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:26,781
Help! There is a girl, trapped in a car.

539
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:29,121
- Where?
- In the parking garage.

540
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,834
Oh God.

541
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:51,601
Out of the building.
Get out from the front!

542
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,242
Mr. Riddick.

543
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,109
Mr. Riddick.

544
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:00,231
I don't know.

545
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:02,146
Mr. Riddick!

546
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,545
Help me!

547
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,896
Come on.
Come on.

548
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,171
Blake.

549
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,934
Oh my god.

550
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:04,399
- Susan! Susan.
- Emma!

551
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:06,238
- We got to get to the roof.
- Oh god!

552
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:09,375
Let's get out of here!
This way!

553
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:10,708
Get out of my way!

554
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,957
Susan.
Susan.

555
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:23,255
Aww!

556
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,076
Oh my god.

557
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,596
This way!

558
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:41,205
Get over here!

559
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:49,012
- Come here. You got to go.
- Okay.

560
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:56,167
Larissa. Larissa.
You have to come with me.

561
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,146
We got to get to the roof.

562
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:00,751
Everybody.

563
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:02,710
Get to the roof.
There's a helicopter coming.

564
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:05,548
- No! Wait.
- Wait. We got to go up!

565
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,556
Aww!

566
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:19,678
Ray.
You better be waiting.

567
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:52,473
Ray.

568
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:17,960
Oh, my god.
Oh my god.

569
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:23,326
Up there.

570
00:39:56,657 --> 00:39:57,838
Oh.

571
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:10,920
Come on. Come on.
We got to go.

572
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,890
Emma, RUN!

573
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:44,784
Ray.

574
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,088
Emma.

575
00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:14,395
Ray.

576
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,965
Ray.

577
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,424
Emma.

578
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,750
I got you.

579
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:27,337
Emma, are you hurt?

580
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:31,366
- Are you hurt?
- Uh, no. I don't think so.

581
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:34,053
Okay. It's going to be okay but listen
we got to get out of here.

582
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,885
I need you to get to the front left seat.
I'll be right there.

583
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

584
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:56,431
Shit!

585
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,949
- Ray!
- Hold on!

586
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:01,333
Help!

587
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:03,829
Somebody help me.

588
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:07,337
Help!
Somebody help!

589
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:42,727
<i>- This is Ray.
- Dad, please help.</i>

590
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:45,220
<i>- Blake, what's wrong?
- Dad, Dad.</i>

591
00:43:45,244 --> 00:43:47,259
<i>There was this huge earthquake</i>

592
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,592
I don't know where Daniel is.

593
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:50,991
<i>I'm trapped in the limo,
in garage of his building.</i>

594
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:53,426
<i>I'm really, really scared, dad.</i>

595
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:55,030
Baby, are you hurt?

596
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,812
Blake.
God damn it.

597
00:43:57,837 --> 00:43:59,600
What?
What is it?

598
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:02,315
Shit.
Her cell service just went out.

599
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:06,871
There is no way a rescue personnel are going
to be digging in the garage anytime soon.

600
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:08,799
Too many populated place ground.

601
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,923
But... uh.

602
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,652
What are we going to do?

603
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,088
We're going to get our daughter.

604
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:46,695
Blake!

605
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,634
- Blake!
- Help me!

606
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:49,826
Help, I'm here!

607
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:52,471
Blake. Blake,
It's Ben, are you okay?

608
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:53,686
I can't get out.

609
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:55,949
The roof collapsed.
My legs are trapped.

610
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:58,154
Okay.
Okay.

611
00:44:59,598 --> 00:45:02,705
Ollie. We need to lift this beam
to get the pressure off her legs.

612
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,333
- Okay.
- Yeah.

613
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:06,851
Let's try this.

614
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,261
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

615
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,352
Ready, 1.

616
00:45:09,377 --> 00:45:10,115
2.

617
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,318
3.

618
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:15,130
Come on.
Give it everything you got.

619
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:16,576
Do it!

620
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:19,972
It's... working...!

621
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:27,726
Ollie.

622
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:38,710
Ben.

623
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,995
- Ollie.
- Let's do it.

624
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,662
Let's do it.

625
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:50,876
No.
No.

626
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:53,010
You guys have to get out of here.

627
00:45:53,035 --> 00:45:55,568
This building is going to collapse.

628
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:03,430
Not a chance in hell
we're leaving you in there.

629
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:12,861
Okay.

630
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,245
Okay.

631
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:17,437
Alright.

632
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:19,811
Here we go.

633
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:32,362
Brilliant.
It's working.

634
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm still stuck.

635
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:00,546
- Ollie.
- She's moving.

636
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:04,356
Hurry, hurry.

637
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,345
Are you okay?

638
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,597
Yeah.

639
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:23,830
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

640
00:47:25,546 --> 00:47:27,757
Thank you.
Thank you both.

641
00:47:27,782 --> 00:47:29,029
Pleasure.

642
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:30,952
Let's go.

643
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:36,742
Come on, it's another aftershock.
We got to get out of here.

644
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:42,635
Hurry!
Come on, come on.

645
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,223
We have to get away from these buildings.

646
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,118
- Blake! Blake!
- Oh my god.

647
00:47:48,143 --> 00:47:49,493
This way.

648
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:55,274
- Oh my god!
- Over here.

649
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,111
Blake!

650
00:47:58,103 --> 00:47:59,322
Jump.

651
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:05,947
Go, go, go.

652
00:48:12,884 --> 00:48:15,938
I cannot believe that Daniel just took off.

653
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:18,678
What an asshole.

654
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:26,457
I got to get a hold on my parents.
I got to let them know I'm okay.

655
00:48:26,482 --> 00:48:28,090
Cell phones aren't working.

656
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:29,746
I've tried.

657
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:33,060
I need to find an electronic store.

658
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:36,461
Does that book of yours list businesses.

659
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:39,936
My book has everything.

660
00:48:41,073 --> 00:48:44,578
The good news is most of our
emergency systems are still working.

661
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:47,957
We got signals coming in from 17 monitors.

662
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,150
We just experienced a 9.1

663
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,909
Lawrence You need to see this.

664
00:48:59,778 --> 00:49:01,819
What've you got?

665
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:06,587
Here are the pulse rates before the quake.

666
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,424
- Yeah, okay.
- And here are the pulse rates now.

667
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:13,787
The same, or higher.

668
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:15,750
The earthquake didn't diminish them.

669
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,951
Oh man.

670
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,177
Oh, this is not good.

671
00:49:21,202 --> 00:49:22,267
Alexi.

672
00:49:22,315 --> 00:49:25,878
I want all the data from every monitoring
stations still up along the fault line.

673
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:27,747
- And get them to me now.
- Right.

674
00:49:27,772 --> 00:49:30,391
- What's going on?
- It's not over.

675
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:33,305
Oh man.

676
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:36,455
Come on.

677
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,269
- I need everybody.
- What are we doing?

678
00:49:38,294 --> 00:49:40,518
Get me on the air.
We need to warn people.

679
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:42,287
How. There's no way to upload a signal.

680
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,501
Ha-ha-ha.
You're at Caltech.

681
00:49:54,914 --> 00:49:56,776
Okay, who wants an "A" in independent study?

682
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:58,034
I'm starting a new class.

683
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:01,430
"How to save lives by
hacking media outlets."

684
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:04,088
Hell yeah, man.
I'm in.

685
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:06,828
Sweet bro.
Get your laptop, let's go.

686
00:50:08,897 --> 00:50:10,573
Move.
Move.

687
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:12,703
Here we go.
Up.

688
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:17,381
It should be just up ahead.

689
00:50:18,692 --> 00:50:20,360
There it is.

690
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,515
Anything running on electricity
isn't going to work.

691
00:50:32,552 --> 00:50:36,423
So, we have to find
a rotary or push button phone.

692
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:38,141
How do you know all these?

693
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,752
My dad.

694
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:42,527
He works for LA Fire and Rescues.

695
00:50:45,264 --> 00:50:47,103
Over here.

696
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:51,038
Great.
I'll look for a landline.

697
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:06,737
Got one.

698
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:14,414
Blake?

699
00:51:14,602 --> 00:51:15,920
<i>Dad...</i>

700
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:18,465
Dad, I got out.
I'm okay.

701
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,207
She's okay.

702
00:51:21,232 --> 00:51:23,182
Let me talk to her.

703
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,609
Blake?

704
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:27,186
Mom?

705
00:51:27,211 --> 00:51:29,503
Oh.
Thank god, honey.

706
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,591
Is Daniel okay?

707
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,404
<i>He left me, mom</i>

708
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,958
He what?

709
00:51:36,983 --> 00:51:38,750
<i>He told a security guard where I was.</i>

710
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:41,124
<i>And then he just took off and...</i>

711
00:51:41,155 --> 00:51:42,380
these 2 brothers that I met,

712
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:44,867
overheard him and they came to help me.

713
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:46,949
I'm with them right now.

714
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:48,654
He left her?

715
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,778
We're coming to get you, honey.
Where are you?

716
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:54,872
I'm in an electronic store in Chinatown.

717
00:51:54,897 --> 00:51:57,344
Honey, it's going to be okay
but I need you to listen to me.

718
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,798
Get out of there is going to be
a couple of bleak reluct nightmares.

719
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:01,633
So get to higher ground.

720
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:03,825
<i>It's safer and that's where
I gonna be able to see you.</i>

721
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,272
- Okay.
- Do you remember where we

722
00:52:05,297 --> 00:52:06,867
spent Mallory's birthday weekend?

723
00:52:06,892 --> 00:52:08,714
- At Coit Tower.
- Yeah.

724
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:11,244
<i>Yeah. That... That tall
cement nozzle thing on the hill.</i>

725
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,176
<i>Exactly.
Don't stop anywhere.</i>

726
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:14,904
Go there.
That's where we'll meet.

727
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:16,725
Stay strong, honey.

728
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,054
We're coming to get you.

729
00:52:18,085 --> 00:52:19,503
<i>Okay.</i>

730
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:20,934
Wait, Mom, Mom.
How...

731
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:23,200
How are you and dad together?

732
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:27,501
We'll explain later, okay.
Honey, I love you.

733
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:29,545
I love you guys.

734
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,499
Bye.

735
00:52:44,068 --> 00:52:45,516
<i>Hi, you reached Daniel.</i>

736
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:48,016
<i>Please leave me a message
and I'll get back to you</i>

737
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,081
You left my daughter?

738
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:53,731
If you are not already dead,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

739
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,452
Attagirl.

740
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:02,953
Alright, we need to get going.

741
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:04,735
So, how's your dad going to pick us up?

742
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,673
He's on his way in a helicopter.

743
00:53:06,698 --> 00:53:08,901
That's so cool.

744
00:53:08,926 --> 00:53:12,017
I need you to look up
Coit Tower on your map.

745
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:17,600
It's your turn.

746
00:53:17,624 --> 00:53:20,008
Your parents will be worried sick.

747
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,754
Thank you.

748
00:53:51,142 --> 00:53:53,288
Run! Run!

749
00:53:57,354 --> 00:53:59,852
All of you! Get out of my way!

750
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:26,955
You know,

751
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,447
when you were talking to Blake,

752
00:54:29,717 --> 00:54:34,342
that was the first time I heard you said
Mallory's name, since we lost her.

753
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,485
Hey, did you know that Blake keeps
pictures from our San Francisco trip?

754
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,901
Yeah.
In her memory box.

755
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,786
So ironic,

756
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,164
us heading back up there.

757
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:53,649
It was a fun trip.

758
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:05,299
Where are we?

759
00:55:05,324 --> 00:55:07,262
Bakersfield.

760
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:08,718
Or what's left of it.

761
00:55:08,754 --> 00:55:11,808
Puts us about 90 minutes from San Francisco.

762
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:23,007
Ray?

763
00:55:30,054 --> 00:55:31,333
Did you just turn off the engine?

764
00:55:31,382 --> 00:55:32,891
Yeah, we've got a gearbox failure.

765
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:34,917
Must be that hit it took in LA.

766
00:55:34,942 --> 00:55:38,255
- I'll have to autorot take down.
- Auto... Auto what?

767
00:55:39,258 --> 00:55:41,035
We're going to crash.

768
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:44,088
- Uh. Okay.
- Hold on.

769
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,088
Here we go.

770
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,051
Aww!

771
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,915
Oh my god.

772
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,032
Almost there.
Almost there.

773
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:11,834
We're just going to settle down right there.

774
00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:13,526
JESUS!

775
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:35,404
We've got fuel all over us.
We need to get out of here.

776
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:50,863
Come on, we got to go.
Stay down and stay low.

777
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:52,123
Okay.

778
00:56:56,847 --> 00:57:00,219
Okay, just got to keep moving.
Look for the key.

779
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:20,488
Come on, come on, come on...

780
00:57:22,683 --> 00:57:24,467
Get in, get in, get in...

781
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:27,982
I think this truck is stolen.

782
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:30,650
Alright. Well.
Let's steal it again.

783
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:38,958
Ray.

784
00:57:38,983 --> 00:57:41,275
Easy.

785
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,019
I'll be needing that truck.

786
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:50,402
Not today.

787
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,695
<i>The quake centered about 20 miles
East of downtown Los Angeles</i>

788
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:13,406
<i>Cell towers are down.
Most of the city's electricity... down.</i>

789
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:15,931
<i>Communications at a virtual stand still.</i>

790
00:58:15,952 --> 00:58:19,762
<i>The devastation in Southern California
is expected to be massive.</i>

791
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,326
<i>In fact, the interstate...</i>

792
00:58:23,776 --> 00:58:26,108
- We're in.
- Yes.

793
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,031
<i>There have been at least 5 aftershocks.</i>

794
00:58:31,056 --> 00:58:33,218
Okay.
Here we go.

795
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,124
<i>We have our first live feed</i>

796
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:36,598
- from Los Angeles.
- 5.

797
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:38,459
- <i>Serena Johnson is on the ground,</i>
- 4

798
00:58:38,484 --> 00:58:40,787
<i>at the seismology center at Caltech.</i>

799
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,619
Hello, Criss.
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes.

800
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:46,687
Executive Director for
Earthquake studies at Caltech.

801
00:58:46,712 --> 00:58:49,160
He and his research partner Dr. Kim Park

802
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:51,752
had come up with a model
that predicts earthquakes.

803
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:54,227
They knew LA was going to get hit.

804
00:58:54,252 --> 00:58:55,778
But nobody listen to them.

805
00:58:55,803 --> 00:58:57,322
It's time now to listen.

806
00:58:57,347 --> 00:58:58,939
- Go ahead, Doctor.
- Okay.

807
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,776
In seismology terms.

808
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:04,444
What we experiencing is
what we called a swarm event.

809
00:59:04,469 --> 00:59:07,577
Basically, California's entire
tectonic plate has shifted.

810
00:59:07,602 --> 00:59:10,100
Yes, it seems the quake we
experienced here in Los Angeles

811
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,265
did major damage all the
way up in San Francisco.

812
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,734
Yeah, but the earthquake that
they felt was from movement

813
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,810
along the fault line in the Central Valley.

814
00:59:16,835 --> 00:59:19,616
The end of the fault line has not moved yet.

815
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:23,260
More importantly people need to know
that the shaking... is not over.

816
00:59:23,285 --> 00:59:25,512
And it's not aftershocks I'm talking about.

817
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:27,417
San Francisco will get hit again.

818
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,399
And it's going to be a
bigger monster this time.

819
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:32,468
Our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater.

820
00:59:32,493 --> 00:59:34,061
It will be so big,

821
00:59:34,086 --> 00:59:37,371
that even though it's
happening here in California,

822
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:41,595
You will feel it on the East Coast.

823
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,269
I cannot emphasize this enough.

824
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:47,840
To the people of San Francisco.

825
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:51,065
You need to get out.
And I mean now.

826
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,087
And if you can't, you need to
find any means possible.

827
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:57,364
To drop, cover and hold on.

828
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,408
Because your life is going to depend on it.

829
01:00:02,802 --> 01:00:04,938
God be with you.

830
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:10,589
San Francisco 184 miles

831
01:00:10,614 --> 01:00:13,395
Aftershocks continue
to rock the Los Angeles...

832
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,497
You ever think about what
our life would be like

833
01:00:15,522 --> 01:00:17,983
if we hadn't lost Mallory.

834
01:00:20,261 --> 01:00:22,457
- No, I don't
- I Do.

835
01:00:22,482 --> 01:00:25,266
- All the time.
- We moved on.

836
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,254
We didn't move on.

837
01:00:27,279 --> 01:00:30,598
- We stop moving.
- We didn't lose her on your watch.

838
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:33,748
- No, but I lost her.
- Can we not talk about this?

839
01:00:33,773 --> 01:00:35,518
You owe it to me.

840
01:00:35,543 --> 01:00:39,721
This... This is the most I've
gotten out of you since she died.

841
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:41,943
I need to know, Ray.

842
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:44,421
Was... Was it me?

843
01:00:44,446 --> 01:00:46,271
What did I do?

844
01:00:46,296 --> 01:00:47,447
Because I never blamed you.

845
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:49,697
I don't want to talk about it,
it doesn't matter.

846
01:00:49,722 --> 01:00:52,456
She's gone and now you're gone.

847
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,977
What's the point.

848
01:00:58,178 --> 01:01:00,256
I guess the point is.

849
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,010
This... is why I stick around.

850
01:01:09,055 --> 01:01:11,136
<i>Wait!
Look out!</i>

851
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:14,411
<i>- Watch out! Watch out!
- Hey! Turn the wheels, turn!</i>

852
01:01:16,151 --> 01:01:17,646
Ray!

853
01:01:46,295 --> 01:01:48,634
What is this?

854
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,040
San Andreas Fault.

855
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:09,115
I told you, we should have
gone the other way.

856
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,380
Because you knew this was going to happen?

857
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,469
We owe you guys a huge thanks.

858
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:22,258
- Really.
- No need.

859
01:02:22,283 --> 01:02:24,762
We already made the same
mistake ourselves, but...

860
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:26,896
busted an axle when we went off the road.

861
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:29,839
Thank goodness my eyes are better than his.

862
01:02:30,577 --> 01:02:33,299
Do you know if there's any way around this?

863
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:37,832
The 198 might not be out, through the pass.

864
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:38,896
How far is that?

865
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:44,008
Oh, got to backtrack maybe 70 miles or so.

Sir, if you don't mind me asking.

868
01:02:55,191 --> 01:02:57,197
Where did you get your hat?

BURDGE AVIATION

870
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:00,217
You guys really bail us out.

871
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:02,337
- Sure we can't fly you anywhere?
- Yeah.

872
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,654
Our son lives in the mountains,
so there's no place to land.

873
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:07,560
- Thanks for the wheels.
- You bet.

874
01:03:07,585 --> 01:03:09,024
Be safe.

875
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:10,549
Bye.

JUMP SCHOOL (BURDGE)

877
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:26,375
We should be fueled up
in a couple of minutes.

878
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,453
Okay, great.

879
01:03:36,738 --> 01:03:38,908
Everything okay?

880
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:44,000
You asked me before if it was you?

881
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:46,142
It wasn't.

882
01:03:50,255 --> 01:03:52,702
I knew you didn't blame me, Emm.

883
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,363
I just don't know how to
deal with... Mallory's death.

884
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:12,359
It was my idea to take
Mallory rafting that day.

885
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:14,133
Ray.

886
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,989
You can't blame yourself for what happened.

887
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,564
It's just different when it's your own kid.

888
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:24,498
I know.

889
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:28,962
Sometimes I can't get that
look she had out of my head.

890
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:32,225
The moment she realized that...

891
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:36,276
I wasn't be able to save her.

892
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,420
And then coming home every day...

893
01:04:40,445 --> 01:04:43,183
to you and Blake calling, hit it harder.

894
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:52,360
Because nothing was the way it used to be
like the way it used to be it was.

895
01:04:54,176 --> 01:04:56,529
It's perfect.

896
01:04:59,227 --> 01:05:02,167
I should have let you in.

897
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:08,059
I just didn't know how.

898
01:05:09,107 --> 01:05:12,674
I'm so sorry for all the things
I did go unsaved.

899
01:05:14,306 --> 01:05:16,810
I really am.

900
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,233
If you couldn't save our daughter,

901
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:27,898
then nobody could have.

902
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,316
I missed her so much.

903
01:05:39,923 --> 01:05:41,947
Me too.

904
01:05:47,049 --> 01:05:49,779
Let's go get our daughter.

905
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:16,269
Let's go.

906
01:06:16,294 --> 01:06:18,621
Keep it moving.
Let's go.

907
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:20,801
Go.
Follow the evacuation line.

908
01:06:20,826 --> 01:06:23,291
Just a few more blocks to Columbus Avenue,

909
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:25,981
which leads to Coit Tower.

910
01:06:28,928 --> 01:06:30,459
Do you mind if I ask.

911
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:33,411
Why you wear 2 of the same necklaces?

912
01:06:37,287 --> 01:06:39,915
One of them used to be my sister's.

913
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:41,797
I...

914
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:44,698
I started wearing it after she died.

915
01:06:44,723 --> 01:06:48,098
We had given them to each other
4 Christmas day before.

916
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,734
- I... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean.
- No, it's okay.

917
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:54,436
I'm... not ready, you know.

918
01:06:57,834 --> 01:07:00,372
Hey, check it out.

919
01:07:00,397 --> 01:07:02,055
What are you doing?

920
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,501
The self-supply box.
It'll have something we can use.

921
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:10,037
Is this it?

922
01:07:11,252 --> 01:07:12,634
Yes!

923
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:15,420
Oh, okay.

924
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:18,152
Here we go.

925
01:07:18,177 --> 01:07:21,677
Every city has a tactical channel that
First Response use to communicate on.

926
01:07:21,702 --> 01:07:24,076
We can listen in and
we can see what's going on.

927
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:25,453
Okay.

928
01:07:25,478 --> 01:07:27,450
Here, take these.

929
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:39,416
Blake!

930
01:07:40,003 --> 01:07:41,337
I think we're going to have a problem with

931
01:07:41,362 --> 01:07:43,566
that big nozzle thing
you were talking about.

932
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:45,098
What?

933
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:47,663
What do you mean?

934
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:59,428
We have to go to Plan B.

935
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,606
I didn't think we had one?

936
01:08:01,764 --> 01:08:03,591
I do now.

937
01:08:06,093 --> 01:08:07,856
We need to get to the next highest ground

938
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:09,846
so that we can signal
my dad in the helicopter.

939
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:11,093
That would be Nob Hill.

940
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:14,493
It's the highest point in the city.
It's the other way.

941
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:15,838
Okay, come on.

942
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:19,272
Wait, no. Blake, wait!
Wait, just.

943
01:08:19,419 --> 01:08:21,755
Just.
Wait.

944
01:08:42,732 --> 01:08:44,368
What?

945
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,734
Blake, we'll be the only ones
going that way.

946
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,498
My dad said to get to higher grounds,
and that's what we're going to do.

947
01:08:52,523 --> 01:08:56,244
But... what if he doesn't make it?

948
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:57,625
Listen.

949
01:08:57,673 --> 01:08:59,841
I know that this sounds crazy.

950
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:03,170
But you have to trust me that he will.

951
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:08,532
I...
I can't.

952
01:09:10,172 --> 01:09:11,857
Ben.

953
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:17,639
Did you know about the push button phone
working with the landline?

954
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,982
The supply box?

955
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:22,476
Tactical radio channels?

956
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,420
I really think we should stick with her.

957
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,675
Okay.

958
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,370
Looks like I'm going to Nob Hill.

959
01:09:40,515 --> 01:09:41,970
Okay.

960
01:09:41,995 --> 01:09:43,918
Let's go.

961
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,925
<i>Residence are encourage
to evacuate immediately</i>

962
01:09:58,613 --> 01:10:00,837
So.
The whole city is evacuating.

963
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,257
Then we got a problem at the airport.

964
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:12,573
- Where're you going to land?
- You can't.

965
01:10:12,598 --> 01:10:14,308
At least not in the city.

966
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,877
Come with me.

967
01:10:41,506 --> 01:10:42,794
Uh.

968
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:44,765
Okay.

969
01:10:47,565 --> 01:10:49,739
You got to be kidding me?

970
01:10:50,005 --> 01:10:52,385
Emma, we have no place
to set this plane down.

971
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,412
And we have to get as close to
Coit Tower as we possibly can.

972
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:57,556
In 3 minutes we're going
to be over Embarcadero.

973
01:10:57,581 --> 01:10:59,048
And?

974
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,214
And.

975
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,847
We're going to drop at AT&T Park.

976
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:04,232
But I don't know how to parachute.

977
01:11:04,257 --> 01:11:06,667
It's okay, we're going to tag and jump.

978
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:08,648
I... I think we should stay with the plane.

979
01:11:08,673 --> 01:11:10,213
The plane is going to nose dive
into the Pacific

980
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:11,496
as soon as it runs out of gas.

981
01:11:11,521 --> 01:11:13,033
Okay.

982
01:11:17,977 --> 01:11:20,522
Trust me.

983
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,993
Oh my god!

984
01:11:31,109 --> 01:11:33,963
- Ready?
- Do I sound ready?

985
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:35,001
Yup.

986
01:11:35,026 --> 01:11:37,080
Woo!

987
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:38,582
It's been a while since
I got you to second base.

988
01:12:42,015 --> 01:12:43,352
<i>With a grave warning from</i>

989
01:12:43,377 --> 01:12:45,977
<i>Dr. Lawrence Hayes blanketing the airwaves.</i>

990
01:12:46,001 --> 01:12:49,447
<i>San Francisco has began
evacuation procedures.</i>

991
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:53,597
<i>The coast guard is asking anyone
with access to a boat to please...</i>

992
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,787
The end of the fault line has not moved yet.

993
01:12:56,812 --> 01:12:58,720
San Francisco is going to get hit again.

994
01:12:58,745 --> 01:13:01,913
This will be a much
bigger monster this time.

995
01:13:02,642 --> 01:13:05,918
I hope we have given
everyone enough warning.

996
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:12,532
This is it, isn't it?

997
01:13:12,557 --> 01:13:14,863
Right now, I wanted to be so wrong.

998
01:13:14,888 --> 01:13:17,477
Everyone take cover!

999
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,724
This will be over soon here.

1000
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:29,803
But I pray for the people of San Francisco.

1001
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:32,640
Did you know Nob is a slang term

1002
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:35,089
which means rich or wealthy?

1003
01:13:35,114 --> 01:13:37,585
It's a shortened version
of the word "Nobility".

1004
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,983
Because of the families that lived there.

1005
01:13:40,008 --> 01:13:43,884
It's also derisively known as Snob Hill.

1006
01:13:50,212 --> 01:13:51,701
What is it?

1007
01:13:51,726 --> 01:13:54,092
Daniel built that building.

1008
01:14:02,254 --> 01:14:03,887
Oh shit.

1009
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:11,154
Move! Move!

1010
01:14:11,849 --> 01:14:13,763
Come on, Ollie!

1011
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:21,866
Aww!
Aww-ha!

1012
01:14:25,784 --> 01:14:27,222
Ollie!

1013
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:29,319
I want to go home.

1014
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:33,499
Hold on. It's going to be okay. I promise.

1015
01:15:16,313 --> 01:15:18,194
They're going to get killed out there.

1016
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,520
Emm, get to the side of the stadium.

1017
01:15:19,545 --> 01:15:22,016
I'll be right back.
Be right back.

1018
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:23,716
It's not safe here.
Get to the side of the stadium.

1019
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,568
Get to the side of the stadium.
Right Now!

1020
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:28,781
The building is going to collapse.
You need to move.

1021
01:15:30,075 --> 01:15:32,367
Hurry!
You got to get out of the street.

1022
01:15:32,392 --> 01:15:34,858
Get to the side of the stadium.
Right Now! Side of the stadium.

1023
01:15:34,883 --> 01:15:37,330
Get to the side of the stadium.
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1024
01:15:37,355 --> 01:15:39,168
Get off the street.
Get to the stadium!

1025
01:15:39,192 --> 01:15:40,797
Get to the side of the stadium.
Come on!

1026
01:15:40,823 --> 01:15:43,155
Get out of the street!

1027
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,275
Alright. Alright.
I got you. I got you.

1028
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,912
Stand up.

1029
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:01,351
Over here, Ray.

1030
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:04,348
- I got her, I got her.
- Here. Take her, Emm.

1031
01:16:09,053 --> 01:16:11,006
You're going to be okay.

1032
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:16,017
Everybody, down!

1033
01:16:36,418 --> 01:16:38,143
Everybody, okay?

1034
01:16:38,535 --> 01:16:40,233
Anybody hurt?

1035
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:41,651
No.

1036
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,656
Emma, are you okay?

1037
01:16:48,681 --> 01:16:50,189
Yeah.

1038
01:16:54,197 --> 01:16:56,714
How'd you know we'll be safe?

1039
01:16:58,358 --> 01:17:00,022
Just get up against something sturdy.

1040
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:01,502
Protect yourself.

1041
01:17:01,527 --> 01:17:03,904
Triangle of life.

1042
01:17:07,105 --> 01:17:08,920
Let's go.

1043
01:17:42,044 --> 01:17:44,290
She's going to be okay.

1044
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:49,808
But how do we get through that?

1045
01:17:57,076 --> 01:17:58,890
We don't.

1046
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,931
We go around it.

1047
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:15,370
You need to take that out of there.

1048
01:18:15,395 --> 01:18:18,708
If you try walking with it,
It will cause more damage.

1049
01:18:28,347 --> 01:18:29,621
This is gonna hurt.

1050
01:18:29,646 --> 01:18:31,229
You ready?

1051
01:18:31,254 --> 01:18:32,770
Okay.

1052
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,039
God.

1053
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,617
Ben.

1054
01:18:48,969 --> 01:18:50,627
I'm alright.

1055
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:52,620
I'm alright.

1056
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,616
Do you think you can get some weight on it?

1057
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:57,040
We have to keep moving.

1058
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,350
We got to get up that hill.

1059
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,175
Okay.

1060
01:19:01,343 --> 01:19:02,631
Here.

1061
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:20,108
How bad did they get hit?

1062
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:26,458
9.6

1063
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,273
Largest quake.
A new record in history.

1064
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,962
No.

1065
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,592
Coit's been burning a while back.

1066
01:20:10,617 --> 01:20:12,899
She's gone some place else.

1067
01:20:14,332 --> 01:20:16,869
Now. Where are you, baby?
Where are you?

1068
01:20:16,894 --> 01:20:18,900
What's your plan B?

1069
01:20:30,547 --> 01:20:31,946
Shit.

1070
01:20:31,971 --> 01:20:33,756
- What's happening?
- We got to go.

1071
01:20:33,781 --> 01:20:35,668
Water being pulled out like that,
it's a tsunami.

1072
01:20:35,693 --> 01:20:37,944
We got to get out of the bay, now!

1073
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:47,870
Wait, wait, wait.

1074
01:20:47,895 --> 01:20:50,143
Give...
Give me 1 second.

1075
01:20:54,882 --> 01:20:57,577
<i>Coast guard has issued a tsunami warning</i>

1076
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:01,426
<i>to coastal areas of
northern and central California.</i>

1077
01:21:15,263 --> 01:21:16,826
We got to...
We got to go.

1078
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:18,444
We got to go.
We got to move now.

1079
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:20,811
We got to get to Daniel's building.

1080
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:36,428
Ray.

1081
01:21:36,506 --> 01:21:38,216
I see it!

1082
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,276
Alright, hold on.

1083
01:21:43,301 --> 01:21:46,298
We got to get over it before it crest.

1084
01:22:37,235 --> 01:22:38,918
Come on!

1085
01:22:38,943 --> 01:22:40,782
Come on...!

1086
01:22:42,549 --> 01:22:45,729
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.

1087
01:22:53,127 --> 01:22:55,042
OH SHIT!

1088
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:04,206
Ray.

1089
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:07,301
Hold on.

1090
01:25:12,104 --> 01:25:14,073
What's that noise?

1091
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:26,564
We're not high enough.

1092
01:25:27,488 --> 01:25:29,244
Get down!
Get down!

1093
01:25:29,272 --> 01:25:30,536
Take cover!

1094
01:25:30,562 --> 01:25:32,591
Hold on tight, Ollie.

1095
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,152
Ben.

1096
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:18,577
Ollie.

1097
01:26:34,517 --> 01:26:36,329
The water is still rising.

1098
01:26:36,362 --> 01:26:38,186
We have to get higher.

1099
01:26:39,572 --> 01:26:40,995
This way.

1100
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,093
- Ben.
- Ollie, come.

1101
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,875
Grab on.

1102
01:27:09,435 --> 01:27:11,697
Oh my god.

1103
01:27:19,616 --> 01:27:21,805
Where is she, Ray?

1104
01:27:21,887 --> 01:27:23,696
She's a smart girl.

1105
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,858
She probably head for
one of these highrises.

1106
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,880
We just got to find her.

1107
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:43,238
Are you alright?

1108
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:45,772
I need to take a look at that leg.

1109
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:47,393
Ollie.

1110
01:27:47,418 --> 01:27:49,781
See if there is something that
we can use as a bandage.

1111
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,619
- And see if you can find clean water.
- Okay.

1112
01:27:54,688 --> 01:27:56,387
I got it.

1113
01:27:59,406 --> 01:28:00,491
Okay.

1114
01:28:00,516 --> 01:28:02,954
Let's see what we're dealing with here.

1115
01:28:11,257 --> 01:28:12,835
What?

1116
01:28:14,303 --> 01:28:16,325
You are absolutely.

1117
01:28:18,147 --> 01:28:20,282
Unbelievable.

1118
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,907
Mom's going to love her.

1119
01:28:43,104 --> 01:28:46,770
- There are a few towels in here.
- Great.

1120
01:28:47,084 --> 01:28:49,411
I'll look for some water.

1121
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:47,302
Hey!

1122
01:29:47,339 --> 01:29:50,348
I can see some people in a boat.

1123
01:29:56,267 --> 01:29:57,626
No way.

1124
01:29:57,651 --> 01:30:01,279
No way.
Those are my parents.

1125
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:04,327
Mom! Dad!
Mom!

1126
01:30:04,352 --> 01:30:06,719
Hey!
We're up here.

1127
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:12,874
Dad.
Mom.

1128
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:14,245
Mom.

1129
01:30:19,156 --> 01:30:21,132
They can't hear us.

1130
01:30:26,185 --> 01:30:27,704
What?

1131
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:33,913
And if we don't get to her soon,
we're gonna need some gas.

1132
01:30:33,938 --> 01:30:35,892
We got maybe an hour,
an hour and a half tops.

1133
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:36,911
- Before we...
- Ray.

1134
01:30:36,936 --> 01:30:38,631
- Yeah.
- Hold... Hold on.

1135
01:30:50,563 --> 01:30:51,835
Oh my god.

1136
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,555
Oh my god.
It's Blake!

1137
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,043
- Oh my god!
- Emma.

1138
01:31:11,355 --> 01:31:12,674
Emma!

1139
01:31:14,257 --> 01:31:16,711
Blake!

1140
01:31:21,997 --> 01:31:23,826
Ollie.

1141
01:31:34,354 --> 01:31:35,848
Ollie.

1142
01:31:35,912 --> 01:31:38,950
Ollie!
Ollie!

1143
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:41,576
Ollie.

1144
01:31:41,635 --> 01:31:43,154
Ollie...!

1145
01:31:44,151 --> 01:31:45,507
Ollie!

1146
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:49,357
I got you.
I got you.

1147
01:31:49,382 --> 01:31:50,863
Where is Blake?

1148
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:52,721
She's over there.

1149
01:31:58,611 --> 01:32:00,599
Stay here, Ollie.

1150
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:05,440
Blake!

1151
01:32:06,967 --> 01:32:10,093
Blake!
Blake!

1152
01:32:16,872 --> 01:32:18,863
The building is sinking.
We have to move.

1153
01:32:18,888 --> 01:32:20,320
We have to move up.

1154
01:32:20,345 --> 01:32:22,340
Come on, Ollie.
Hurry.

1155
01:32:33,977 --> 01:32:35,781
No, no, no, no.

1156
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:37,951
Oh my god.
Blake.

1157
01:32:37,976 --> 01:32:39,961
Emm, take the wheel.

1158
01:32:39,986 --> 01:32:42,218
I see a way in.
I'm going after her.

1159
01:32:42,243 --> 01:32:43,815
Ray.

1160
01:32:47,599 --> 01:32:49,491
I'm bringing her back.

1161
01:32:53,811 --> 01:32:55,586
I promise.

1162
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:06,575
Daddy.
The door is locked.

1163
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,730
Blake, don't worry.

1164
01:34:07,755 --> 01:34:09,448
I'm going to get you out of here, okay.

1165
01:34:09,473 --> 01:34:11,287
I'll get you out.

1166
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,864
Dad, please.
I'm scared.

1167
01:34:38,889 --> 01:34:40,924
I'm running out of air.

1168
01:34:41,544 --> 01:34:44,132
Daddy, I don't think if I can do this.

1169
01:34:44,157 --> 01:34:46,689
Blake, you hold on!
Hold on!

1170
01:34:54,441 --> 01:34:55,926
There.

1171
01:34:57,428 --> 01:34:58,446
Ben.

1172
01:34:58,471 --> 01:34:59,889
I don't want Blake to die.

1173
01:34:59,914 --> 01:35:03,104
She's not going to die.
I'm going back for her.

1174
01:35:03,129 --> 01:35:04,137
Okay?

1175
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:06,674
But I need you... to stay here.

1176
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:08,424
Okay?

1177
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,084
Good boy.

1178
01:35:47,459 --> 01:35:48,842
Ben.

1179
01:35:50,381 --> 01:35:51,560
On my back.

1180
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:53,608
On may back, Ollie.

1181
01:36:01,045 --> 01:36:03,342
Blake is going to die.

1182
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,210
Isn't she?

1183
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:13,232
Alright.
Alright.

1184
01:36:13,872 --> 01:36:16,957
I love.
I love you dad.

1185
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:18,749
And please...

1186
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:19,979
Please tell...

1187
01:36:20,004 --> 01:36:22,655
Please tell Mom that I love her too.

1188
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,754
Blake, don't you quit on me.

1189
01:36:26,929 --> 01:36:28,471
Blake!

1190
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:44,535
Blake.

1191
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:48,842
Blake.

1192
01:37:48,975 --> 01:37:50,308
Blake!

1193
01:37:58,681 --> 01:38:00,785
Come on.
Breathe, Blake.

1194
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,341
Breathe, honey.

1195
01:38:15,929 --> 01:38:18,910
We got to get out of here.
Break a window.

1196
01:38:44,802 --> 01:38:46,232
Oh my god.

1197
01:38:57,566 --> 01:39:00,364
Move!
Get out of the way!

1198
01:39:02,893 --> 01:39:05,013
WATCH OUT!

1199
01:39:11,824 --> 01:39:13,407
Get on.
Let's go, let's go!

1200
01:39:13,432 --> 01:39:15,073
Move, move, Ollie.

1201
01:39:15,098 --> 01:39:17,070
- Come on, Ray.
- Take her, Emma.

1202
01:39:17,095 --> 01:39:18,234
I got her.

1203
01:39:18,295 --> 01:39:19,715
It's okay.

1204
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,522
Wake up, honey.
Come on.

1205
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:25,021
We got to...

1206
01:39:25,046 --> 01:39:26,617
- Get us out of here, Emm.
- Okay.

1207
01:39:26,642 --> 01:39:28,611
The building's coming down.

1208
01:39:37,365 --> 01:39:39,808
Oh... my... god...

1209
01:40:14,076 --> 01:40:15,487
Come back to me.

1210
01:40:15,512 --> 01:40:18,017
Your dad and I are right here now.

1211
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,779
Blake.
Breathe.

1212
01:40:21,585 --> 01:40:23,900
Come on, baby.
Come on.

1213
01:40:24,472 --> 01:40:26,641
Baby, breathe.

1214
01:40:57,186 --> 01:41:01,287
No... my... baby...

1215
01:41:23,384 --> 01:41:25,326
I'm not gonna lose you too.

1216
01:41:26,859 --> 01:41:29,208
Come on.
Come on.

1217
01:41:33,531 --> 01:41:34,985
Baby, come on.

1218
01:42:13,775 --> 01:42:15,616
<i>...a picture of the
scale of the devastation.</i>

1219
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:18,042
<i>And this was the sight
in many neighborhoods.</i>

1220
01:42:18,067 --> 01:42:22,446
<i>Families and friends huddle together.
Shaken but grateful to still be alive.</i>

1221
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:26,607
<i>Seismologists will be keeping a close watch
on all of the world's tectonic plates.</i>

1222
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:31,395
<i>As the San Andreas quake could have
rippling effects throughout the globe.</i>

1223
01:42:35,347 --> 01:42:37,340
You did good.

1224
01:42:37,832 --> 01:42:39,841
Thank you.

1225
01:42:40,182 --> 01:42:42,219
We all did.

1226
01:42:43,974 --> 01:42:45,600
<i>Authorities in San Francisco are</i>

1227
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:47,942
<i>attributing a tremendous
amount of lives saved</i>

1228
01:42:47,967 --> 01:42:51,502
<i>thanks to local experts who were
able to give ample warning</i>

1229
01:42:51,527 --> 01:42:53,490
of the massive earthquake

1230
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:04,707
<i>Mean while recovery efforts
had begun in the bay area.</i>

1231
01:43:04,732 --> 01:43:09,083
<i>Where TEMA, National Guard and
UN relief teams have all been mobilized</i>

1232
01:43:09,109 --> 01:43:13,277
<i>Aided by the thousands of
volunteers pouring into the state.</i>

1233
01:43:31,593 --> 01:43:34,593
SAN FRANCISCO. WE WILL GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

1234
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:46,709
Ollie.
Ben.

1235
01:43:47,918 --> 01:43:49,707
I...

1236
01:43:49,732 --> 01:43:52,146
I found this on the boat.

1237
01:43:56,999 --> 01:43:58,813
Thank you.

1238
01:44:08,298 --> 01:44:11,258
We want to thank you guys for,
being there for Blake.

1239
01:44:11,283 --> 01:44:13,023
Yeah, thank you.

1240
01:44:13,048 --> 01:44:14,344
You're welcome.

1241
01:44:14,369 --> 01:44:17,526
But it was more like, she was there for us.

1242
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:19,153
I think.

1243
01:44:27,787 --> 01:44:29,915
This is incredible.

1244
01:44:32,676 --> 01:44:33,869
