1
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:14,293
I'm going to die here, Balbi.

2
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,368
I'm going to die here.

3
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,060
Alone.

4
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,326
I desever it.
I do.

5
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:05,087
But believe me, it was real.

6
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,435
It was real.

7
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,210
Casanova!
Open the door!

8
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,479
Balbi?

9
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,643
It took longer than I thought.

10
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:00,958
Come.

11
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,418
Now what?

12
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,797
You said you had a failsafe plan
if I got us through the roof.

13
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,298
- Did I?
- Yeah.

14
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:40,922
Oh.

15
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:14,570
Help me out.

16
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
Balbi!

17
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,250
You know, this is much more comfortable.

18
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:33,443
Come on!

19
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,099
The Inquisition's guards
will comb the territories.

20
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,742
We will only find immunity abroad.

21
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,023
What about Strasbourg?

22
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,678
Yeah, you will love Strasbourg.

23
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:58,044
Me?

24
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,658
We have to split up, Balbi.

25
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,723
- It's safer that way.
- But you said...

26
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:04,968
if I broke us out you'd take me with you.

27
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,250
I know.
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:10,151
I want to live like Casanova.

29
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:14,398
There is no Casanova.

30
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,630
Not anymore.

00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:52,807
In the 18th century Giamcomo Casanova

33
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,658
was Venice's most notorious citizen.

34
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:57,712
He lived a live of pleasure and debauchery
untill his arrest in 1755.

35
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,569
In the spring of 1757 Giacomo Casanova

36
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,718
escaped the leads prison
and fled to his homeland with nothing

37
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:04,485
deciding to start his life over in...

38
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,577
PARIS

39
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,112
Hold still!

40
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:32,368
How I wish they had sufficient sense
to recognise your excellence

41
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,829
You have much cause for indignation.

42
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,561
And it angers me daily to see that

43
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,195
nothing has been done for you.

44
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,146
- Giacomo!
- Mrs. Balletti.

45
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,912
- The rumours of your escape are true.
- Yes.

46
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:01,301
- You came straight to me.
- You have always been like family.

47
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,787
- You look...
- I know.

48
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,296
Madame!
Three minutes!

49
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,589
Quick.
Get me out of this.

50
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,452
- How long will you stay?
- As long as it takes.

51
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:13,768
I thought this could be
a good place to start over.

52
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,466
Well, you know, Paris

53
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:20,153
isn't always very kind to outsiders.

54
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:23,989
Yeah, I know.
I just have to find a way to support myself.

55
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,453
Last time you were here,
you were only interested in pleasure.

56
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,860
I come with greater ambitions.

57
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:33,420
Do you know I speak four languages?

58
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:35,513
I'm a writer.

59
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:38,327
I was a student of mathematics.

60
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,267
A duelist.

61
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,823
You're a man of many talents, Giacomo.

62
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,868
I'm a joke.

63
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,754
I have nothing.

64
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,066
This might be my last chance.

65
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,507
What happened to you?

66
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:01,724
Tell me.

67
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:06,249
Two years in a dark cell...
eaten alive by fleas...

68
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,600
just because I...

69
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,579
I couldn't stop indulging myself.

70
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:22,247
Silvia, I hate to ask but...

71
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,800
I need a place to stay.

72
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:26,994
Just for now.

73
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,968
The wig maker from the theater
has a basement across the alley.

74
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:34,097
- I'll ask him.
- Thank you, Silvia.

75
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,001
- Don't thank me.
- Places, Madame!

76
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,487
I'm on.

77
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,306
Welcome to Paris.

78
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:55,092
The King's library
is now up to 3.500 volumes.

79
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,320
My hope is that the great
artists and thinkers of Europe

80
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,814
will come to Versailles,

81
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,389
like they have flooded to the salons
of Paris, for discussion and debate.

82
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:12,490
They never seem to recapture
the beauty of their first bloom.

83
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,850
Madame!
Madame!

84
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:19,697
It's the King.
There's been an attack.

85
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,838
- I didn't see him.
- Shh, shh, shh.

86
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:30,359
Look at me.
Look at me.

87
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,179
It's all right.

88
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:35,351
It's all right.

89
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:37,807
Mm-hmm.

90
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:41,002
Get her out of here.
The royal family is on its way.

91
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,978
What happened?
What happened?

92
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,757
Madame, please.

93
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,518
- Tell me.
- It's a three-inch wound.

94
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:03,380
- It's superficial.
- And the assassin?

95
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,125
- I'm sure you'll be briefed on all of this.
- Please, I need to know now.

96
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:10,747
A disgruntled servant named Damiane.
I don't know more.

97
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,116
Some people don't love him
the way they should.

98
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,916
The people are paying high taxes
to fund an unnecessary war.

99
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:23,100
Find out if this servant
has any accomplices.

100
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,076
I'm sorry.
Do I work for you?

101
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:28,627
You work for the King, you arrogant prick.

102
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,834
Don't forget how you got there.

103
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,702
Monsieur de Bernis.

104
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,383
This came for you.

105
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,852
There we go, gentlemen.

106
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,873
See you next door.
Adieu.

107
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,123
Play on, play on.

108
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:28,350
Mmm.

109
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,529
Love without love,

110
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,449
it's worthless, don't you think?

111
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,750
The average woman pays me no attention.

112
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,383
No is an unacceptable answer.

113
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:46,987
I can't tell you how many women
have initially refused me.

114
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,154
- You must have a secret.
- Yes.

115
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:53,005
I have an abnormally long tongue.

116
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,233
Oh.

117
00:10:58,729 --> 00:10:59,929
Truth is...

118
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,402
I make them feel...

119
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,337
I'm falling in love with them.

120
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:08,713
How?

121
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,947
Because I fall in love with them.

122
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:26,002
So, where is your pain?

123
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:30,125
I saw you clenching
your teeth and your hands.

124
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,668
At the beginning,
I thought it was a tell, but

125
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:35,363
no, you're in pain.

126
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:38,149
If you must know,
it's the agony of a sciatic nerve.

127
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:41,770
- It's your back or your legs?
- Are you a doctor?

128
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,626
It's the string of amber around your neck.

129
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:49,373
- You have access to a lab?
- Maybe.

130
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,159
Why?

131
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,068
Draw a pentagram on your leg

132
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:55,601
using a mixture of sodium nitrate,

133
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:58,020
yellow sulphur, quicksilver.

134
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,580
Just try it.

135
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:02,139
If it works...

136
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:07,426
If it works, you'll pay me
your winnings from tonight.

137
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,177
Fair and square.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

138
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:17,314
Well, well, well,
you don't waste much time.

139
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,505
- You're late.
- It's been a busy day.

140
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,275
There was an attempt on the King's life.

141
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,479
- Was it successful?
- No.

142
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,314
No?
Pity.

143
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:34,716
Your escape is quickly
becoming the talk of Paris.

144
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,232
I haven't even started to embellish it yet.

145
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,429
Let's talk alone.

146
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:53,382
This note.
You want to work.

147
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,713
You know everyone in Paris
full of power, influence.

148
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,358
Just find yourself
a wealthy patron to live off.

149
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,752
- You're very good at that.
- No, I want more.

150
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,268
I need more.

151
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:10,381
But can you give up your
exhaustive list of bad habits.

152
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:11,854
You did.

153
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,975
They made you minister.

154
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:16,849
Don't they know
how you behaved in Venice?

155
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:18,513
You were a terrible influence.

156
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:22,891
How's Marina?

157
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:27,789
I don't know.

158
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,618
She won't see me.
She won't respond to my letters.

159
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:39,837
She left the abbey,
and I fear she's fallen into a depression.

160
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:42,024
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:46,327
If you want to work, I have
something well suited for you.

162
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,461
- You've heard of Madame Pompadour?
- No.

163
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:53,001
You will.
She's the King's mistress...

164
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,422
a libertine and a commoner like you,

165
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,281
though she fights like hell to hide it.

166
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:00,976
The King noticed her during a
masquerade and made her his paramour.

167
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,512
She's quickly become a threat to the state.

168
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,670
- A threat?
- He'll do anything she says.

169
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,155
Two years into a war with Britain,

170
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,879
and the treasury has been
bled dry because of her.

171
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:15,435
After you.

172
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:30,673
So you were saying, Madame...

173
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,653
- Pompadour.
- Uh-huh.

174
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,629
I'd like you to get to know her.

175
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:38,107
Make her an intimate ally.

176
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,844
Find out what her plans are.

177
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,244
- Think of it as a spy mission.
- Sounds more like seduction.

178
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,035
Is there a difference?

179
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:50,925
I cannot do that.

180
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,805
A man should not be defined
by one thing his whole life.

181
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,861
Suddenly, you're more than your cock?

182
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,538
- Yes.
- Interesting.

183
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:06,995
You're also a peasant who's lived
by his wits his entire life,

184
00:15:07,503 --> 00:15:09,253
a gambler, and a con man,

185
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:13,849
whose ability to charm women
is the envy of every man.

186
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,833
It's not a curse, it's an asset.

187
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,753
Use it.

188
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:21,785
If money, power,

189
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,385
respect,

190
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:26,414
is what you want,

191
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:30,797
all that stands between me and the
future of France is this one woman.

192
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,684
Think of what that could mean.

193
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:35,547
For you.

194
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:39,642
For both of us.

195
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,429
I'm going to need new clothes.

196
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,900
Perception is everything in Paris.

197
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:06,948
Oh.

198
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:55,350
Good afternoon.

199
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,254
So sorry.
I wasn't expecting you.

200
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,105
You don't recognise me.

201
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,330
I am Manon.

202
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:12,184
Mother sent me to neaten up.

203
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,340
Manon.
Oh, my Lord.

204
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:19,048
- Last time I saw you...
- I was 13.

205
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:21,842
Yes.

206
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:23,404
I'm sorry for my...

207
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,706
No, please.
Please, let me help you.

208
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,320
You're far above neatening up
after a slob like me.

209
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:32,187
I've heard so many stories
from my family about you.

210
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,214
- And your adventures.
- Well, don't believe them all.

211
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,711
Oh, sir, I love the stories.

212
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:40,749
I've been nowhere.

213
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,017
That's why I read so much.

214
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,737
I'd do anything to see Venice.

215
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:50,716
It's so wonderfully crowded.

216
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:54,194
At night, you can hear people
dreaming and laughing and

217
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:57,262
making love.

218
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:02,067
I've heard it is a city where women
are free to be as they wish.

219
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,578
For a hundred years.

220
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,331
Paris is making strides, but

221
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:09,591
it'll be too late for me.

222
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:12,522
- What do you mean?
- I'm to be married in a month.

223
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:16,018
Congratulations.
To whom?

224
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,681
Monsieur Claremont,

225
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,845
My harpsichord teacher.

226
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,833
A good, safe match, mother says.

227
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:26,820
And are you a good safe girl?

228
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,081
I don't know what I am.

229
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,012
I have felt like that most of my life.

230
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,861
You better go.

231
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,498
I'll walk you out.
Come.

232
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:47,731
Good to see you, Manon.
Go home.

233
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:51,375
Here.
So you don't forget about me.

234
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,349
- Oh, thank you.
- Manon.

235
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,621
Go home now.

236
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:01,553
Stay away from her, Giacomo.

237
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,946
Silvia, I would never do anything...

238
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,560
Please.
I know you.

239
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,308
I promise, all right?

240
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:15,457
This came for you.

241
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:33,795
You're here.
Great. Come in.

242
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:41,261
When I told my aunt about your
remarkable cure for sciatica,

243
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:43,975
- she said she had to meet you.
- Really?

244
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,065
Well, I'm so glad I could help.

245
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:54,362
You're not as handsome as they say.

246
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,733
I...
I tend to grow on people.

247
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:05,442
Wow.

248
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,805
This is an incredible place.

249
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:11,097
Yes, it is.

250
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,888
- Marquis d'Urfé.
- Of course.

251
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:21,320
So this is what you do all day?

252
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,404
Well,
I would prefer to play with my salts than

253
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,586
worry about my coiffure.

254
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:30,599
Or have conversations with vacuous courtiers

255
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:32,983
who only care about
the colour of their rouge.

256
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:35,437
Do I smell sulphur?

257
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:36,756
Very good.

258
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:42,085
It's been on a fire 15 years.

259
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:45,013
Needs another four or five.

260
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,487
- Until...
- Until a powder...

261
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,986
that accelerates
the natural progression

262
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,275
of metals into gold.

263
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,431
- The quintessence.
- Ah, you know it.

264
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:59,495
- You know it.
- I might.

265
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,383
The highest goal of alchemy.

266
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:04,968
I knew I knew your name.

267
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:06,534
Friends in Venice.

268
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:10,465
Fellow cabalist.
Freemasons.

269
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:14,176
You're a believer.

270
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:17,750
I believe in many things.

271
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,280
And that is why I invited you for dinner.

272
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:25,830
I thought you might fit in.

273
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:31,576
Ahh!

274
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:35,875
I've just come from Lorraine.
Spent the day with Voltaire.

275
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,890
Showed him how I can melt diamonds.

276
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:43,256
You see, from 12 small diamonds,

277
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:46,960
I can produce one large one
without any loss in weight.

278
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:50,378
He called me the wonder man.

279
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:53,914
- No, really.
- Bravo, I'accord!

280
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:01,189
And then showed the stone

281
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,500
to the exquisite Madame Pompadour.

282
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:07,731
Naturally, she wants one for herself.

283
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,974
Madame Pompadour, the King's mistress.

284
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,612
That's right.
Are you a friend of hers?

285
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:15,401
No.
No, no.

286
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:18,291
Well, I am of longstanding.

287
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,575
I have a strong connection to the monarchy

288
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:25,013
dating back to the baptism of Louis XIII
and his sisters Elisabeth and Christine.

289
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,501
It was at the Corrival.

290
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:30,290
Sorry, but that was 150 years ago.

291
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,419
Yes.

292
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:35,991
Well, how old are you?

293
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:41,029
At least 300 years, but I can't be sure.

294
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,497
Well, you look great for your age.

295
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,066
Thank you.

296
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:54,809
What has this most impressive
man promised you?

297
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,279
Oh, promised.
Um...

298
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,924
The ferrite around your neck,

299
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,916
said to entice a bolt of lightning.

300
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,742
- And elevate ones...
- That's right!

301
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:05,167
The Tablet of Hermes.
Quite right.

302
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,289
Has he promised you eternal life?

303
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:10,292
My friend, these things are no joke to us.

304
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:12,668
You are not the friend of anyone here.

305
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,289
Especially not the Marquis.

306
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,868
I'm sorry.
I don't fit in at all.

307
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,427
It was very nice meeting you.

308
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:37,447
Monsieur Casanova, wait.

309
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:40,055
I know an imposter when I see one.

310
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:41,690
Such hostility.

311
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:44,322
It is one thing to capture a woman's heart.

312
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,364
But you...
You have hijacked her common sense.

313
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:49,964
How much do you want?

314
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:54,917
You know the Marquis has a fortune so
great, there's enough for both of us.

315
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:56,986
You disgust me.

316
00:23:57,011 --> 00:24:01,507
Do not interfere in my
friendship with the Marquis.

317
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,483
I know many people across Europe,

318
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:07,599
and you will find yourself
back in chains...

319
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,452
or worse.

320
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:54,055
Italian.

321
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:55,766
Why are you following me?

322
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,742
I had to make sure it was you.

323
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:59,400
I come with word from Bragadin.

324
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,450
Bragadin.

325
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,414
I'm sorry for the rude welcome.

326
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,824
He was eager to get this information to you.

327
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:15,000
His contacts on the inside
acquired details about your arrest in Venice.

328
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:17,211
He thought you want to know.

329
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:18,759
Tell him I already know.

330
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:23,507
It's why I came to this wholly mediocre city.

331
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:27,630
And tell my dear, old friend to come visit.

332
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:32,011
I will soon be on my feet,
and eager to entertain him as always.

333
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:49,500
You sent for me, Minister de Bernis?

334
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:51,764
Please.

335
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:56,601
Madame Pompadour will be at her
libertine party tonight in the fourth.

336
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,831
My associate, Claude Patu,
will make the introduction.

337
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:05,914
- I'll have to check my schedule.
- I would not joke, my friend.

338
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,905
She is a formidable woman.

339
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,850
Is it true the King's
assassin has been sentenced?

340
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:16,737
- A public execution is being planned.
- Good.

341
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:21,071
Then Madame Pompadour
should be in a fine mood.

342
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,410
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

343
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,096
- I'm looking for Claude Patu.
- Hmm.

344
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,237
- Thank you.
- Yes.

345
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:41,453
- Five? In one night?
- Throughout the night.

346
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,877
And then once after breakfast.
I call him Count Six Times.

347
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:47,735
Egg whites are the secret.

348
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:51,385
Egg white help the man ejaculate forcefully,

349
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:54,350
five or six times.

350
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,740
Is that right?

351
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:00,139
You must be
Monsieur Casanova.

352
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,494
If you'll excuse us.

353
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:10,378
My God.

354
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,179
What has happened to the women of Paris?

355
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,179
The Libertines have denounced
all religious convention:

356
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:18,035
chastity, monogamy.

357
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,867
Paris is becoming an erotic playground.

358
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:23,238
"The infernal serpent,

359
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,057
he it was whose guile,

360
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,527
stirred up with envy and revenge,

361
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,520
deceived the mother of mankind.

362
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:37,763
What time his pride had
cast him out from heaven,

363
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:41,190
with all his host of rebel angels,

364
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:44,273
aspiring to set himself in glory

365
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,997
above his peers."

366
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:55,536
Madame,

367
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:58,530
may I introduce Giacomo Casanova?

368
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,606
This is the man who escaped the Leads?

369
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,167
Yes, Madame.

370
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:05,747
You're an Italian.

371
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:08,029
Venetian.

372
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:10,225
Ah, Venice.

373
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,206
Venice exhausts me...

374
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,283
The masks, the unspoken smugness.

375
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:18,332
At least Parisians abide
by their own moral code.

376
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,518
We know what life is
and make the most of it.

377
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:24,266
So what is it like?

378
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:25,932
Sorry?

379
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:27,217
Freedom.

380
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:29,562
I assume you are now a free man.

381
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,927
Yes, indeed.

382
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:34,752
But a man is not at liberty
to do everything he pleases.

383
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,931
He becomes a slave the moment

384
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:40,905
he allows his actions
to be ruled by passion.

385
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,317
Are you flirting with me, Monsieur Casanova?

386
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,960
Women across Europe may be drawn

387
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:56,234
to the dangers of a travelling
Venetian like yourself.

388
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:57,732
A man more gallant,

389
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:00,541
more sexually adept than his peers.

390
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,639
But if you ever speak to me
again in that tone,

391
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:06,477
I will have you eviscerated.

392
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,960
Wait.
Please accept my apologies, Madame.

393
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:17,509
It's rare that I find myself nervous
in the presence of a woman.

394
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:21,113
But I've been eager to meet you.

395
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,438
Why is that, exactly?

396
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:28,095
We both come from humble beginnings,

397
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,458
being told what we cannot
be our entire lives,

398
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:34,821
and yet look where we are.

399
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:40,536
You don't know me.

400
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,919
I'm tired.

401
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,292
Possibly tired of you.

402
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:58,612
Mm.
That's lovely.

403
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:03,353
Unfortunately,
I'm taken for the evening.

404
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,506
Monsieur Patu has already paid.

405
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,616
But I know someone else.

406
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,843
Come in.
Don't be shy.

407
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:17,204
Make yourself comfortable.

408
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:18,696
Helena.

409
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,887
Helena.

410
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,762
You have a guest.

411
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:36,337
We awaken you.

412
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:38,726
Yes, sir.

413
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:44,621
- You call this a bed?
- I have no other, sir.

414
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:48,375
No sheets or anything.

415
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:55,045
You normally go to bed with that on?

416
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:56,938
Yes.

417
00:32:58,713 --> 00:32:59,986
Well, not tonight.

418
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,689
I'll pay you a Louis.

419
00:33:04,374 --> 00:33:05,574
Oui?

420
00:33:09,635 --> 00:33:11,678
And I want to see you get undressed.

421
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,854
There's nothing more beautiful
than a woman...

422
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:43,342
when you can actually see her.

423
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,297
Wait.

424
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,799
- I cannot submit for less than 25 Louis.
- What?

425
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,895
My sister says that's the going rate
for a virgin in Paris.

426
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,645
C-Can you make sure
your sister is right?

427
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:32,173
I'm supposed to let you
do all you please, sir,

428
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,741
but not that.

429
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,232
Ohh.

430
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:42,417
All right.

431
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:44,637
I understand.

432
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:49,475
We can't do that.

433
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:54,948
But I can do this.

434
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,030
You know,

435
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:14,270
a woman of your elegance should
not be selling herself for money.

436
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,469
You could be destined for better things.

437
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,321
You're just saying that.

438
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:26,905
I will prove it to you.

439
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,283
I just need to get some money together.

440
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,070
Yes.
Anyway...

441
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,281
Transmigration.

442
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:54,659
Transmigration.

443
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,218
"Transmigration is illegal
in a Catholic country."

444
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:05,566
When I was a boy,
I had terrible nosebleeds.

445
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:09,230
My grandmother took me to Murano
to consult a witch.

446
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,356
And is that where your
fascination with magic began?

447
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:13,873
I believe so, yeah.

448
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:17,470
- And what of your mother, Giacomo?
- What about her?

449
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,101
I barely knew her.

450
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:23,956
I love gladiolas.

451
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:26,941
Oh, what a shame there are none here.

452
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:32,822
I lost a husband, a son, a
daughter, and two granddaughters.

453
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,031
That's why I put so much faith in
the existence of other worlds.

454
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:41,002
Your outburst at dinner was so genuine.
Be that way with me.

455
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:43,776
My mother didn't die.

456
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,608
- She left.
- Ah. I'm sorry.

457
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:50,044
Don't be.
She was an actress.

458
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,858
Travelling was her livelihood.

459
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,598
I know what you've been brewing for
the last 15 years in your lab.

460
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:05,755
Thousands across Europe are searching
for the Philosopher's Stone.

461
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:09,997
- Ah, but I am ahead of them all.
- Says whom, Saint Germaine?

462
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:13,776
I believe the Count doesn't have
your best interest at heart.

463
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:17,772
He sees you as a lonely and lost
woman in search of an heir.

464
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:19,640
The Count entertains me.

465
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:21,748
But let me help you.

466
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,204
You know the Stone can only
be possessed by males, right?

467
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,458
I know.

468
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:32,490
You're planning to regenerate your soul.

469
00:37:32,526 --> 00:37:33,927
You think it's possible?

470
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:35,381
I do.

471
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,839
But transmigration is illegal
in a Catholic country.

472
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,908
I don't want to end up back in jail.

473
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,599
I could protect you.

474
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:48,024
I could make it worth your while.

475
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,793
I feel a strong connection with you.

476
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,581
Shh.
Shh shh shh shh shh.

477
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,407
- Are you the artist Gustaf Lundberg?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

478
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:28,030
We're going to flaunt your assets on
the amorous stock market of Paris,

479
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:32,024
improve your standing
by finding you a man...

480
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:34,371
A significant man.

481
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,865
I'm impressed that you could encounter
such youth and beauty in a woman

482
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,613
and seek to improve her.

483
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:51,521
It shows shocking self-control.

484
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,277
There's beauty in promise.

485
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:57,601
Rescuing a young woman
from an uncertain future

486
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,928
can be just as gratifying.

487
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,839
Isn't the new Casanova
above this kind of thing?

488
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:13,183
- It's not for me. It's for the King.
- The King?

489
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,189
I met your Madame Pompadour.

490
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:18,659
She is, as you said, a worthy adversary,

491
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:22,187
far too intelligent to surrender
her secrets, even to me.

492
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,547
The key is to find her vulnerability.

493
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:30,318
And as far as I can tell, she only has one.

494
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:33,973
I'm listening.

495
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,709
Her age.

496
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,313
The King will eventually
tire of a woman in her 30s

497
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,544
and start the search for a new mistress.

498
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:45,686
What if you were to present
him with another option...

499
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,531
One that looks this good,
and a virgin to boot?

500
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:55,096
A replacement...

501
00:39:56,542 --> 00:40:00,030
removing Madame Pompadour entirely.

502
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,364
You are a perfect scoundrel.

503
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:08,011
I knew I could trust you.

504
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:11,808
Well done, Giacomo.
It's a good start.

505
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:16,798
A viewing party has been arranged
for the execution of Robert Damiens.

506
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:20,722
Anyone who's anyone will be there.
You'll come.

507
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:22,453
I wouldn't miss it.

508
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:44,818
Oh.
It's you.

509
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:50,994
I was just practising a sonata.
Can-- Can I play it for you?

510
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,268
No. I'm sorry.
I'm pressed for time.

511
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:56,123
Actually, I was looking for your mother.

512
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,524
- Oh.
- Is she at home?

513
00:40:58,607 --> 00:40:59,927
I'll get her.

514
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,861
Oh, no, no.

515
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:08,400
- You...
- Yes?

516
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:13,774
I've been invited to this party on Saturday,

517
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:15,589
with a guest.

518
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:19,255
I know your mother would never approve.

519
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,286
I have ways of sneaking out.

520
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:25,148
I cannot condone something like that.

521
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,425
But if you happen to be

522
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,943
in Place de Rêve at noon.

523
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:53,402
Giacomo.

524
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,315
Silvia.

525
00:41:56,817 --> 00:42:00,646
- You look tired.
- I have a fever, but I'm fine.

526
00:42:01,683 --> 00:42:04,508
- What is it?
- I have to ask you for one last favour.

527
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,494
If only that were true.

528
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,908
Can you get me into the opera
at Fontainebleau?

529
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:47,867
Madame.

530
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:41,874
You have to admit it.

531
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,890
French music is inferior to Italian.

532
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:50,159
It's the melody.
Hasn't changed in a hundred years.

533
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:53,133
I was told you have
something urgent to tell me.

534
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:55,130
Urgent
 No.

535
00:43:55,909 --> 00:43:57,411
No, not at all.

536
00:44:00,753 --> 00:44:02,743
I just wanted to get you alone.

537
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,365
You have 30 seconds.

538
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,790
First I want to apologise
for our last meeting.

539
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:17,102
I have spent a lifetime trying
to cross borders and barriers

540
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,326
with a humble background.

541
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:22,655
While I take pride in how far I have come,

542
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:26,384
I should not have made assumptions
about you.

543
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:32,172
I live with a constant barrage
of royal courtiers

544
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:36,653
who deem it a disgrace that the King
compromise himself with someone like me.

545
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,031
It exhausts me.

546
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,148
It's not you.

547
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:47,903
There are men in this city
who fear a woman in power.

548
00:44:51,053 --> 00:44:55,163
One of these men has hatched a plan to

549
00:44:55,631 --> 00:44:58,817
extricate you from the King's embrace.

550
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:05,613
- Who would be so sick?
- The new Foreign Minister.

551
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:09,842
De Bernis?

552
00:45:10,805 --> 00:45:13,262
He asked me to recruit a young girl,

553
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,670
one he could introduce to the King.

554
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,075
And have you found the girl?

555
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:25,859
De Bernis is in a very
good position to help me.

556
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:28,893
I'm in a far greater position to help you.

557
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,697
I agree.

558
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:35,372
So I delivered a young prostitute
to de Bernis,

559
00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:39,381
one who will surely
be rejected by the court.

560
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,541
She...

561
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,939
can't be compared to you.

562
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:49,172
De Bernis is your friend.
Why would you betray him for me?

563
00:45:50,026 --> 00:45:51,641
When I was in prison,

564
00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:55,679
I learned
that my so-called friend...

565
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:59,143
had me arrested.

566
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,877
I would have died there
if it were up to him.

567
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,547
Was it over a woman?

568
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:08,564
A nun.

569
00:46:19,103 --> 00:46:21,299
I need you to help me destroy him.

570
00:46:22,564 --> 00:46:24,944
I do love tales of revenge.

571
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:29,865
I want to watch the rest of the opera,
but I will consider your offer.

572
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,623
Consider?

573
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:36,718
I don't know you, nor do I trust you.
Yes, I'll consider it.

574
00:46:41,153 --> 00:46:44,228
Well, thank you very much, Madame.

575
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,593
Thank you, Monsieur Casanova.

576
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:08,980
Can I get three?

577
00:47:32,185 --> 00:47:36,363
- Sometimes I just can't stand it.
- What, exactly?

578
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:40,617
How much I want everything.

579
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:43,397
Let's look.

580
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,142
Come here.

581
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:04,593
- I've been thinking about your situation.
- My...

582
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,858
- Your impending marriage.
- Oh.

583
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:10,495
I'm willing to speak
with your mother about it.

584
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,771
Help me reason with her.

585
00:48:12,905 --> 00:48:14,761
You have the soul of an adventurer,

586
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:18,636
the unquenchable thirst
for all life has to offer,

587
00:48:20,057 --> 00:48:21,935
good and...
And bad.

588
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:27,847
The King!

589
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,621
Please excuse me just for a moment.

590
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:05,847
My old friend, welcome.
I've been waiting for you to arrive.

591
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:13,965
I had the painting of sweet Helena
delivered to the King's court.

592
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:17,401
- And?
- It was rejected.

593
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,534
Good but not great.

594
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:21,467
I'm sorry to hear that.

595
00:49:24,397 --> 00:49:25,723
It begins.

596
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,828
Of course, a virgin like Helena
is a valuable commodity,

597
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:44,414
so I was able to deliver the girl
to a higher standing.

598
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,516
- How do you mean?
- Come see.

599
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:55,689
The court is full of wealthy old man

600
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:58,166
with sadistic sexual appetites.

601
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,670
Your plan remains a great one.

602
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,532
We will find a mistress
to replace Madame Pompadour,

603
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:25,291
a better one.

604
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:28,690
In the meantime,
I'd like to arrange a meeting for you

605
00:50:28,715 --> 00:50:30,917
with the King's Controller of the Treasury.

606
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,424
About what?

607
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,726
Didn't I promise to help
you if you helped me?

608
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:43,619
I'm going to pay
my respects to the King.

609
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,839
- Would you like to meet him?
- No. Not today.

610
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,103
I know I should feel nothing
but friendship towards you,

611
00:51:18,614 --> 00:51:20,599
but I feel uneasy

612
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:23,254
when a day passes and you
don't come by the house.

613
00:51:25,852 --> 00:51:29,893
Well, then I will come
by the house more often.

614
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:44,623
And we think that compassionate women can

615
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,745
watch such horror with ease.

616
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,938
I've always thought bad people
deserve what they get,

617
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:53,385
and I believe that in my heart.

618
00:51:53,747 --> 00:51:55,146
What about change?

619
00:51:57,452 --> 00:51:59,388
People are capable of change.

620
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:01,783
We are who we are.

621
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:03,929
It's undeniable.

622
