1
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,679
(heavy breathing)
(low rumbling)

2
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,679
(crickets chirping)

3
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,972
(distant clattering)

4
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,710
- Why are there cameras everywhere?

5
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,630
I don't know, mom, it's just weird.

6
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,037
Is daddy gonna get rid of them?

7
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,163
What?

8
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,750
There are not raccoons in the attic.

9
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,533
No, and I better not hear anything.

10
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,880
I just got here about an hour ago.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,730
How about last night or this morning?

12
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,920
Okay, you guys have a good time.

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,180
I'll see you next week.

14
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,013
I love you.

15
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,843
(gasping)

16
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,843
(breathing heavily)

17
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,593
That's some weird ass toys.

18
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:19,816
I wonder what's in here.

19
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,066
(laughing)

20
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,516
Oooh, what the hell is that smell?

21
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,143
This better not be someone's ashes.

22
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,039
What the hell?

23
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,613
What is up with these
people and these toys.

24
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:50,712
Nope, mm-mm.

25
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:59,812
Go right back, take it
outside to your new home.

26
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:01,145
Oooh, it stinks.

27
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:16,967
You are going outside.

28
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:22,018
It's cold.

29
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,163
(wind howling)

30
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:08,983
(phone ringing)

31
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,378
That's, that's from inside.

32
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:15,053
What the...

33
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:18,556
Hello?

34
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:30,938
Hello?

35
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,267
Hello?

36
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:28,732
What?

37
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,204
(distant knocking)

38
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,226
(knocking on door)

39
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,059
(Renee screaming)

40
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,059
(breathing heavily)

41
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,708
(footsteps passing)

42
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,499
(footsteps passing)

43
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,629
(light clicking)

44
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,782
(TV clicking)

45
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,794
(static hissing)

46
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,249
(loud banging)

47
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,082
Hello?

48
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,113
Who did this?

49
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,713
Who did this?

50
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,593
Reggie, if you're here, stop playing.

51
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,860
You know damn well my
dad will whoop your ass

52
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,060
if he knew you were in
here while he wasn't.

53
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,773
Hello?

54
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,121
Well, whoever it is wanna
come and clean this up

55
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,871
because I'm not cleaning this up.

56
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,140
Who's doing this?

57
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:55,866
Hello?

58
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,639
(distant screaming)

59
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,846
(breathing heavily)

60
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,320
Whoever made this mess, I swear,

61
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,760
got me cleaning this damn mess.

62
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,943
All this damn fake blood.

63
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:29,034
(water splashing)

64
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:29,867
(sighing)

65
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,793
This is freaking annoying.

66
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:37,123
(distant screaming)

67
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,693
This is disgusting.

68
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,566
Look at this.

69
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,600
If this stains my,

70
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,140
if this stains my mom's floor...

71
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:57,345
(muttering)

72
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:00,480
Hello?

73
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,443
Look at this.

74
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:13,355
(water splashing)

75
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,552
(water draining)

76
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,962
(water running)

77
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:05,799
(water running)

78
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,534
Are you serious?

79
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:59,184
(Renee screaming)

80
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:08,434
Fuck.

81
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,823
This shit ain't funny.

82
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:16,779
What the hell?

83
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,037
Who's doing this?

84
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:41,698
Fuck, fuck.

85
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,352
Who's doing this?

86
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,836
I'm tired of fucking cleaning.

87
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,667
Look at this shit.

88
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,188
What is this?

89
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,104
Oh, this better not be blood.

90
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,464
Look at it all on the counter.

91
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,970
(whooshing)

92
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:36,305
(clattering)

93
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:40,550
Hello?

94
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:46,212
All right, stop playing around now.

95
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:25,627
(water draining)

96
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:50,697
Hello?

97
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:22,108
(footsteps passing)

98
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,494
Hello?

99
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,349
(door opening)

100
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:43,641
Hello?

101
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:47,318
Hello?

102
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,913
Oh shit, I got my own
washer and dryer up here.

103
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:41,828
That's dope.

104
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:43,690
I don't have to go all the way downstairs.

105
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,890
Just come right up here.

106
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,849
(crickets chirping)

107
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,619
(ladder springs creaking)

108
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:32,591
(crickets chirping)

109
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,008
Who's down there?

110
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,930
You better get the hell out of here.

111
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,343
How do I know someone's not watching me?

112
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,185
Where's the light?

113
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:14,436
(water running)

114
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:21,361
(door creaking)

115
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:26,673
(crickets chirping)

116
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:35,206
I know it's not Reggie.

117
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:37,873
I checked his Instagram
and he's in North Carolina.

118
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,300
I know it's not raccoons.

119
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,930
I sent you the video of hello
written all over the floor

120
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,390
and raccoons wouldn't--

121
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,973
Mom, why is daddy yelling?

122
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,090
Please tell daddy it's
not one of my friends.

123
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,587
I don't know who it is, but I'm scared

124
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:12,793
and I'm not imagining things.

125
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,053
What do you mean I might be doing it?

126
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,510
Sleepwalking?

127
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,010
I haven't done that since
I was 10 years old, mom.

128
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,083
I guess it's possible,
but how would I know?

129
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,510
Okay, momma, I will.

130
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,176
(sighing)

131
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:47,009
Love you too.

132
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:55,260
(sighing)

133
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:18,865
(crickets chirping)

134
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:41,926
(whooshing)
(distant clattering)

135
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,600
(footsteps passing)

136
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,820
(door creaking)

137
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:48,211
(light clicking)

138
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:57,911
(phone ringing)

139
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,526
(dryer clattering)

140
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,066
Hello?

141
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:46,077
Hello?

142
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:01,463
What is this doing in the dryer?

143
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:09,480
Raccoons, it's no damn raccoons.

144
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,937
(door creaking)

145
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,849
(music box thudding)

146
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:51,349
(childlike chiming music)

147
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:54,525
(sighing)

148
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,792
(screaming)

149
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,294
These goddamn dolls.

150
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,499
(sighing)

151
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,382
(door thudding)

152
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:42,215
Shit.

153
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:51,421
(crickets chirping)

154
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:58,406
(distant screaming)

155
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,405
(vacuum running)

156
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,275
It's cold in here.

157
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:44,471
And what is that smell?

158
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:11,498
What are you still doing here?

159
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:14,930
Uh-uh.

160
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,290
You gotta go.

161
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,123
Nope.

162
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,757
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

163
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:36,146
Mm-mm.

164
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:41,421
Stupid.

165
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,463
(door locking)

166
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,270
(toy teeth chattering)

167
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,614
Who's doing this?

168
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,040
It's not funny anymore.

169
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,353
Please stop.

170
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,457
Come on now.

171
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,673
Hello?

172
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,220
(sighing)

173
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,960
Please stop doing this.

174
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,624
You're upsetting me.

175
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:39,541
(distant clicking)

176
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,303
I should call the police.

177
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,933
What the hell?

178
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:36,974
(music box clicking)

179
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:40,474
(childlike chiming music)

180
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:49,447
(footsteps running)

181
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:59,175
(crickets chirping)

182
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,223
(whooshing)

183
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,737
What the heck?

184
00:43:58,183 --> 00:44:01,100
(distant laughing)

185
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,674
(knocking)

186
00:44:49,482 --> 00:44:50,315
(phone beeping)

187
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:51,280
Hey, it's me, guys.

188
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,110
And I am back.

189
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,330
Um, I'm in our new house
on Steelmanville Road

190
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,010
and one of your fools think it's funny

191
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,463
to sneak in here and scare
me on my first night.

192
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,890
If my dad finds out you're in here,

193
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,936
he's gonna kill you.

194
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,092
(phone beeping)

195
00:45:07,092 --> 00:45:09,759
(phone beeping)

196
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,040
Momma, you need to get some of this shit

197
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,093
cleaned out of here.

198
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,670
All right, this my aunt Bebe's room.

199
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,940
I just put a tape on it, so I can tell

200
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,551
if someone's going in or out,

201
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:50,043
but it's locked, so, yeah.

202
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,090
If you're hiding in
here, I'm gonna find you.

203
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:24,080
(phone beeping)

204
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:25,820
Hello?

205
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:40,824
You better not be hiding back here.

206
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,990
I'm gonna find you if you're in here.

207
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,203
(phone beeping)

208
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:35,196
Hello?

209
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,132
(phone beeping)

210
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:17,657
And my parents' bedroom is locked.

211
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:32,802
I don't think my parents trust me.

212
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:42,143
(phone beeping)

213
00:48:45,013 --> 00:48:45,846
Hello?

214
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:14,140
This door was opened and now it's locked.

215
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,510
I think it's so creepy that
someone might be in here

216
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,660
because what if it's
somebody I don't know?

217
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,410
Who's in there?

218
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,573
Hello?

219
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:27,525
(knocking on door)

220
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,183
Hello?

221
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,087
I need a weapon.

222
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,595
(phone beeping)

223
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:49,012

224
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,113
(whooshing)

225
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:33,253
Who are you?

226
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,605
(clown laughing)

227
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:37,438
Who are you?

228
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:41,074
(low breathing)

229
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,050
(eerie warbling)

230
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,443
If you don't leave, I'm
gonna call the police.

231
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:54,828
(whooshing)

232
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:02,696
You better get the fuck out of here.

233
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,613

234
00:53:06,878 --> 00:53:09,545

00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,070
Listen, I'll just explain
it to you when you get here.

242
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,103
Why not?

243
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,780
Well, can you borrow your mom's car?

244
00:54:07,462 --> 00:54:10,045
(loud banging)

245
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,690
Let me call you back.

246
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:12,206
(phone ringing)

247
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:14,978
Are you coming to get me?

248
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,647
You don't get off till six?

249
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,480

250
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,153

And what popped up?

254
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:45,144

thing as no haunted house.

255
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:47,816
Oh shit.

256
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:52,721

01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,330
I took from this house

352
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:46,890
and in the middle of it, I keep getting

353
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,660
these push notifications,
'cause the cameras

354
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,010
are still on the iPad connected here.

355
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:54,296

- Clown?

361
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,040
- [Renee] Yes, the clown
that chained me up down here.

362
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,353
I bet you didn't see him.

363
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,890
- I hate clowns.

364
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:12,723
Let...

365
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,820

366
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:15,870

367
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,513

371
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:40,315
(grunting)

372
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:43,767
Goddammit.

373
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:44,716
- [Renee] Here, let me do it.

374
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:46,699
- If I can't do it, you can't.

375
01:20:46,699 --> 01:20:47,532
Here.

376
01:20:49,737 --> 01:20:52,737

I came in here, these lights were off.

381
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,042
The front door was open.

382
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:09,625
This door was open.

383
01:21:10,927 --> 01:21:12,480
- The door was unlocked?

384
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,730
- Yeah, it was wide open.

385
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:16,724
- [Renee] I locked it.

386
01:21:16,724 --> 01:21:18,141
- Here, let's go.

387
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,390
Well, where you going?

388
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:23,270
- I'm getting out of here.

389
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:25,620
- We don't know where he's at, so come,

390
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,420
let's just figure this out, come on.

391
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,960
Figure it out.

392
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,823
There was a book here, used to be here.

393
01:21:40,169 --> 01:21:41,810
Where the hell is it?

394
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,303
Oh wait, here it is, come on.

395
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,443
Yeah, this is it.

396
01:21:48,443 --> 01:21:50,280
This is the book I was talking about.

397
01:21:51,496 --> 01:21:52,660
- I was checking that out earlier.

398
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:55,853
- Does clown begin with a K or a C?

399
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:58,430
- Are you for real?

400
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:59,500
- Come on.

401
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,333
- A C.

402
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,560
- All right, here it is.

403
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,933
Is that him?

404
01:22:04,933 --> 01:22:05,766
- Yep, that's him.

405
01:22:05,766 --> 01:22:09,300
- All right, that is
the Crescent Moon Clown,

406
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,660
which can only rise
during a crescent moon.

407
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:16,434
However, according to
this, the previous owner

408
01:22:16,434 --> 01:22:19,890
had put it into a box,
covered it with ashes,

409
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,770
and sat a cross on top,

410
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,520
and then locked the box and put it away.

411
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,430
Did you find a box like this?

412
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,110
- [Renee] Yeah, I found it downstairs

413
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,500
and it had this ugly doll in it

414
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,170
and it was stinkin',
so I threw it outside.

415
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,710
- [Tom] So you opened it.

416
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:36,543
- [Renee] Yep.

417
01:22:36,543 --> 01:22:37,390
- And you took the cross out.

418
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:38,223
- [Renee] Yep.

419
01:22:38,223 --> 01:22:39,950
- Well, that's how he got free.

420
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:42,370
But, even though it's a crescent moon,

421
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,855
and he's out of the box, he needs a witch

422
01:22:44,855 --> 01:22:48,300
to be able to convert
him into a large form,

423
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,430
like you say he is now.

424
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:51,750
Have you seen anything that
looks like a witch around?

425
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,215
- [Renee] That nasty lookin'
thing with the robe on?

426
01:22:54,215 --> 01:22:56,370
- Yeah, that sounds like,

427
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,250
that sounds like it.

428
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,570
Well, we'll deal with her later.

429
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:02,090
We gotta deal with him first.

430
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:05,544
But you want the good
news or the bad news?

431
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:06,640
- [Renee] I don't know.

432
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,940
- There is no good news.

433
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,340
Here's the bad news.

434
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,480
According to this, the way
the Crescent Moon Clown

435
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,560
pays back his person that freed him

436
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,680
is by digging a grave, killing them,

437
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,810
throwing them in it, and burying them.

438
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:26,027
So, right now, this clown
is somewhere out back there,

439
01:23:26,027 --> 01:23:28,050
digging a hole for you.

440
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:28,883
- [Renee] Nope.

441
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,063
- But I have an idea.

442
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,920
I have an idea how we're
gonna deal with this.

443
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,343
Come on, follow me.

444
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,880
All right, so here's what we're gonna do.

445
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,720
He still thinks you're chained
and locked in the basement.

446
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,110
So, that means he's
coming back to get you.

447
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:48,950
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hide

448
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,840
in this room right here

449
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,690
and when he comes in that door,

450
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,380
he's gonna come here to turn
and go down the basement

451
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,680
and I'm gonna run forward

452
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,150
and just shove him down the steps,

453
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,850
shove him as hard as I can.

454
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,550
Hopefully he snaps his neck.

455
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,420
But I'll slam the door shut.

456
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,730
I'll push that chair over

457
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:05,900
and you and I will get out of here

458
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,010
and get as far away from
this place as possible.

459
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,340
- [Renee] For real?

460
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,490
- This is what we're gonna do.

461
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,770
So, while you go hide
out there, keep an eye.

462
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:14,830
- All right.

463
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,440
- I'm gonna hide here

464
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,838
and we'll wait for him to come back.

465
01:24:18,838 --> 01:24:19,671
All right?

466
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:21,338
- [Renee] All right.

467
01:24:38,356 --> 01:24:40,184
(Tom screaming)

468
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:43,052
(Tom thudding down steps)

469
01:24:43,052 --> 01:24:44,135
- [Tom] Fuck.

470
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,647
(Renee screaming)

471
01:24:52,206 --> 01:24:55,039
(Renee screaming)

472
01:25:01,466 --> 01:25:02,638
- What the fuck?

473
01:25:02,638 --> 01:25:03,532
(heavy slapping)

474
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,529
Give me my damn wig.

475
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:08,950
You don't fuck with a black girl's hair.

476
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,100
- [Tom] Did we get him?

477
01:25:13,396 --> 01:25:14,229
Oh fuck, oh shit.

478
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:16,896
(low whooshing)

479
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,050
- [Renee] You want some
of this too, bitch?

480
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:21,883
Come on.

481
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:26,454
(low whooshing)

482
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,224
- [Tom] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

483
01:25:28,224 --> 01:25:29,225
(loud banging)

484
01:25:29,225 --> 01:25:30,058
(clown laughing)

485
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:30,891
- [Renee] Stop it.

486
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:32,113
(clown laughing)

487
01:25:32,113 --> 01:25:33,000
- [Tom] Ow.

488
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,833
(loud banging)

489
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:36,583
(clown laughing)

490
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:41,674
(Renee screaming)

491
01:25:44,404 --> 01:25:46,452
(footsteps approaching)

492
01:25:46,452 --> 01:25:48,785
(whooshing)

493
01:25:56,823 --> 01:25:58,906
- Renee, our plan worked.

494
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:01,823
(sighing)

495
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,993
Wait, where are you going?

496
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,733
Hang on.

497
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:09,123
Wait up.

498
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:13,485
- Can you give me a ride to my friend's?

499
01:26:13,485 --> 01:26:16,083
- I would love to, but I don't own a car.

500
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,470
- [Renee] Of course you don't.

501
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:20,813
- [Tom] Hang on.

502
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,940
So, you gonna stay here?

503
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:27,951
- [Renee] No, I'm getting out of here.

504
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:29,503
I'm moving out of the south, fool.

505
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:36,660
(distant screaming)

506
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,410
What the hell was that?

507
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:39,973
- [Tom] Ah, it's a long story.

508
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:50,571
(low whooshing)

509
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:54,071
(childlike chiming music)

510
01:27:26,059 --> 01:27:27,381
(clown laughing)
