1
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:19,297
- Here we go guys, we'll
do it nice and smooth.

2
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:30,920
Can I have the first wall, please.

3
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,033
House lights on.

4
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,070
First tree, we're gonna
put that on the mark.

5
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,210
That one goes over there,

6
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,958
you'll see the marking.

7
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,333
House lights on.

8
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,690
Can I have the swords, one for Hamlet?

9
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,692
Awesome.

10
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:46,711
That's the one you practiced with, right?

11
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,714
- Ah, yes, I think so.

12
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:48,547
- The actors can come out.

13
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:49,950
Ophelia, there she is.

14
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,010
Oh, you look beautiful.

15
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,843
I love this dress.

16
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:53,100
I'm so glad we chose this one.

17
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,514
- I know.

18
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,720
- We're gonna, please go
there with Hamlet and Laertes.

19
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,060
I heard the choreography yesterday
was a little too intense.

20
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,250
What's going on over here?

21
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,820
I saw her spinning before.

22
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,760
Is that like a warmup?

23
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,280
- Yes.
- Is that a thing we do?

24
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,090
So why don't we spin our way onto the set.

25
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,590
And these candles, this
is for Gertrude's bedroom.

26
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,403
Okay.

27
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:14,443
Can we smoke it up please?

28
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,683
- Everybody quiet on
set, let's roll sound.

29
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,123
Roll camera.

30
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,153
Great, from the Horatio, scene
one output, take one, mark.

31
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,156
- And action!

32
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,813
- Tell my story.

33
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,183
The rest is silence.

34
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,050
- Although of Hamlet,
our dear brother's death,

35
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,543
the memory be green.

36
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,753
The time hath come to set our grief aside.

37
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,883
Therefore our former
sister, and now our queen,

38
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,783
we became man and wife.

39
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,207
How is it that the clouds
still hang over you?

40
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:11,100
- Good Hamlet, cast your
mourning clothing off

41
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,893
and let your eye look
down with love on Denmark.

42
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
Do not forever with your down cast lids

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,453
seek for your noble father anymore.

44
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,138
You know, it's normal.

45
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,670
All that lives must die.

46
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,743
Passing through nature to eternity.

47
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,970
- I know it's normal, Mother.

48
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,970
- If you know, why seems it
then so different with you?

49
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,513
- Seems?

50
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,720
No, it is.

51
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,690
I know not seems.

52
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,070
It's not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

53
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,660
nor customary suit so solemn black,

54
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,660
nor running river in my eye
could describe me truly.

55
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,513
These indeed seem,

56
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,363
for they're the actions
that a man might feign.

57
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,203
What I feel inside, is not pretense.

58
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,409
- It's good and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,

59
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,443
to reverently mourn your father's death.

60
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,830
But to persist in endless
mourning is unmanly grief.

61
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,270
You are direct successor to our throne

62
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,430
and with no less nobility of love,

63
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,240
any caring father bears his son.

64
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,417
I offer up my love to you.

65
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,190
For your intent to go back
now to school at Wittenberg

66
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,760
does go against our
prayers and our wishes.

67
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,440
- We do implore-

68
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,180
- And urge you to remain here,

69
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,590
in the cheer and comfort of our court.

70
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,053
Our foremost courtier
and our cherished son.

71
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,990
- Let not your mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

72
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,560
Please stay with us.

73
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,110
And don't return to Wittenberg.

74
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,233
- I will obey your wishes,

75
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,273
my dear mother.

76
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:26,571
Oh that this too, too
sullied flesh would melt,

77
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,113
thaw, dissolve itself into a dew.

78
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,299
Or that the everlasting
can not set his laws

79
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,823
against self slaughter.

80
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:47,171
God, oh God, how weary, stale, flat,

81
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,143
and unprofitable seem to me
all the workings of this world.

82
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,260
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

83
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,020
Within a month she married
almost wicked speed

84
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,020
to race with such alacrity,
to incestuous sheets.

85
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,530
My God, a beast that
lacks all sense of reason

86
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,830
would have mourned longer!

87
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,160
But she...

88
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,703
Married my uncle.

89
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,293
My father's brother,

90
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,390
but no more like my
father than I to Hercules.

91
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,133
It cannot and it will not come to good.

92
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,553
Horatio?

93
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,440
What brings you here from
school at Wittenberg?

94
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,950
- A truant disposition.

95
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,740
- I know my fellow
student is not a truant.

96
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,487
- Hamlet, Hamlet, Hamlet!

97
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,423
- Oh.

98
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,630
What a piece of work is a man.

99
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,240
How noble in reason, how
infinite in faculties,

100
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,240
informed and moving, how
express and admirable in action.

101
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,970
How, like an angel in
apprehension, how like a-

102
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,673
- God.

103
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:53,413
- The beauty of the world,
the Paragon of animals.

104
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,560
And yet to me, what is
this quintessence of?

105
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,130
- Dust.

106
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,470
- There are more things in
heaven and earth Horatio

107
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,113
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

108
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,253
Now, what's brought about
this unexpected visit?

109
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,110
- Your father's unexpected funeral.

110
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,173
- Not my mother's unexpected wedding?

111
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,680
- Her hasty wedding came as a surprise.

112
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,440
- Thrift, thrift, Horatio.

113
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,240
The cooked meats left uneaten
at my father's funeral

114
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,420
were coldly served up
at my mother's wedding.

115
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,253
- Wedding.

116
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,013
- When I had met my dearest foe in heaven,

117
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,680
than live to see that
hellish day, Horatio.

118
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,953
And throughout it all,

119
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,590
I still see my father.

120
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,423
- See?

121
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,033
Where?

122
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,583
- Here.

123
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,423
And in my mind's eye.

124
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,463
- He was a goodly king.

125
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,523
- He was a man.

126
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,830
And even with his faults,

127
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,873
I shall not look upon his like again.

128
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,443
- Hamlet...

129
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,980
I think I saw your father,

130
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,233
late last night.

131
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,193
- Saw?

132
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,123
- Yes.
- My father?

133
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,120
- For two nights has the spirit

134
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,620
of your father appeared before me.

135
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,010
- Did he speak?

136
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,360
- He lifted his head as if
to speak, but said nothing,

137
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,250
and vanished before my sight.

138
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,993
- My father's spirit?

139
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,670
- His face was filled
with sorrow and despair.

140
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,470
- I fear some foul play
and foul deeds will rise.

141
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,593
- Hear me, Hamlet.

142
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:52,730
I am doomed to walk the
earth until the crimes

143
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,730
done to me in my life are
burnt and purged away.

144
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,680
- Crimes?

145
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,583
- If ever you did love your
dearest father, revenge,

146
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,023
my foul and most unholy murder.

147
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,723
- Murder?

148
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,293
- Murder most foul.

149
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,570
While sleeping in my orchard,

150
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,540
a serpent stung me.

151
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,530
Dear Hamlet, know the serpent
that did take your father's

152
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,423
life now wears his crown.

153
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,133
- My uncle?

154
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,640
- Yes, that incestuous, adulterous beast,

155
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,660
with evil overtures and sensual
lust did seduce with guile

156
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,860
my seeming virtuous queen.

157
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,720
Asleep within my garden,

158
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,180
your uncle stole upon me as I slept

159
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,163
and poured a poison potion down my ear.

160
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,867
And by my brother's hand
was I usurped of life,

161
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,830
of crown, of queen and left for dead

162
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,533
with all my imperfections unconfessed.

163
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,230
Let not the royal bed
of Denmark be a couch

164
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,023
for infidelity, and incest.

165
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,790
Revenge my foul murder or I'm damned.

166
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,683
- Alas poor ghost.

167
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,643
I will remember you.

168
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,200
I will not let your soul be cursed

169
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,830
to walk upon this earth for all eternity.

170
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,713
I will not sleep until you are revenged.

171
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,303
Oh, villain, villain, smiling.

172
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,130
Damn villain.

173
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,130
How one may smile, smile and be a villain.

174
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,983
- The time is out of joint.

175
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:25,836
- Oh fateful night.

176
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:32,553
That ever I was born to set it right.

177
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:52,287
- For Hamlet's letter and
this trifle of his favor.

178
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,723
It is just a passing
fancy and nothing more.

179
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,950
A rose bud in the bloom
of a young man's nature.

180
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,200
Passing, not permanent.

181
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,089
Sweet, nothing more.

182
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,490
- Nothing?

183
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,683
- No, nothing.

184
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,589
His high rank means his
will is not his own.

185
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,903
And he is enslaved forever to his birth.

186
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,670
Just think what loss
your honor may sustain

187
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,460
if with too trusting
ear, you hear his songs,

188
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,020
or you lose your heart, or...

189
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,920
your chaste treasure open

190
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,093
to his relentless royal overtures.

191
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,013
Fear it, Ophelia.

192
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,930
Fear it and remember my sister dear,

193
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,283
best safety lies in fear.

194
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,730
- I'll keep in mind your
warning while you're gone.

195
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,820
But, dear brother, do not
as some impious pastors do,

196
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,750
show me the steep and
thorny path to heaven,

197
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,550
while like a vein and reckless libertine

198
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,443
the path of promiscuity
you take and turn deaf ear

199
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,870
on your own advice.

200
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,703
- Fear not.

201
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,447
- Yet here, Laertes?

202
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,970
Abort, abort.

203
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,173
For shame!

204
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,290
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail

205
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,703
and you're still here.

206
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,813
Fare ye well.

207
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,093
- Most humbly do I take
my leave, dear father.

208
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,550
Remember well, what I've said to you.

209
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,100
- It's locked within my memory.

210
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:01,390
- What is it Ophelia,
that he has said to you?

211
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,850
- He spoke of something
doing with Lord Hamlet.

212
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,173
- Tell me what it is
between both you and Hamlet.

213
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,420
- He has of late
made many tender shows

214
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,043
of his affection to me.

215
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:18,700
- And you believe these
tender shows of his?

216
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,153
- I do not know, dear
father, what to think.

217
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:27,628
- Then I'll tell you.

218
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,133
Stop acting like a little-

219
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,893
Stop acting like a wanton.

220
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,680
- My Lord, he has expressed his love

221
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,480
to me in honorable fashion.

222
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,997
- Aye, fashion you may call it.

223
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,240
Foolish, foolish girl.

224
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,620
- He's sworn the love
he feels for me is true.

225
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,473
- Be wary daughter, of Lord Hamlet's vows.

226
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,523
Do not believe his words
or cunning thoughts.

227
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,200
I will not in plain terms
from this time forth,

228
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,653
allow you to spend time
alone with him, or,

229
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:20,821
you to speak a single word to him.

230
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,510
- I shall obey, my Lord.

231
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,953
- My Lord-

232
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,733
- Polonius.

233
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,580
Dear Gertrude has says he's found

234
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,393
the very source of
Hamlet's strange behavior.

235
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,873
- I'm sure it's nothing
more than we have discussed.

236
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,870
His father's death and
our over-hasty marriage.

237
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,260
- My Lord, since brevity
is the soul of wit,

238
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,250
I will be brief.

239
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,990
Your noble son is mad,

240
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,770
his madness manifests itself in myriad-

241
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,853
- More meaning, with the less art.

242
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,803
- Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

243
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,610
Lord Hamlet sent this
letter to my daughter.

244
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:06,373
"To the celestial and
most beauteous Ophelia,

245
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,797
"and her excellent white breasts-

246
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,443
"Bosom, bosom, bosom."

247
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,298
- Hamlet sent this to her?

248
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,543
- Yes, yes, madam.

249
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:21,737
"Doubt that the stars are higher,

250
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,317
"doubt that the sun is above,

251
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,173
"doubt truth to be a liar,

252
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,496
"but never doubt I love.

253
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:35,400
"Oh dear, Ophelia, I am
yours forevermore, Hamlet."

254
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,620
- Has she received his love?

255
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,303
- I gave her stringent
orders that she should not.

256
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,453
That she should lock herself
against any approaches.

257
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,433
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

258
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Rejection, rejection is the
cause of Hamlet's madness.

259
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,380
- How can we be certain?

260
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:13,836
- You know, he always walks
alone there in the hallway.

261
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,497
I'll have Ophelia waiting there for him.

262
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,433
- And?

263
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:28,070
- We'll hide ourselves and
we'll see what happens.

264
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,793
- We will do it.

265
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,903
- My Lord.

266
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,560
The player King has arrived.

267
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,773
- Welcome!

268
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,663
Old friend.

269
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,823
- Thank you my Lord.

270
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,110
- So what shall we have
the actors perform for us?

271
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,063
- A comedy?
- No.

272
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,470
I once saw you perform a play
called The Murder of Gonzago.

273
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,880
- Aye my Lord.

274
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,270
- Could you perform it tomorrow night?

275
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,460
- Certainly my Lord.

276
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,550
- And could you learn a
speech of some 12 or 16 lines

277
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,383
which I would write for-

278
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:31,216
- Hamlet.

279
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:33,763
- Aye, my Lord.

280
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,490
- Then go, make you ready.

281
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,413
You are welcome to Elsinore Castle.

282
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,560
- Thank you, my Lord.

283
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,590
- My Lord.

284
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,540
Follow me this way.

285
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,450
- For all I know, my father's
ghost might be the work

286
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,450
of the devil trying to
deceive and damn me.

287
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,710
I'll have these actors enact the murder

288
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,380
of my father as described
to me by the ghost

289
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,100
before my uncle.

290
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,140
I'll observe my uncle closely.

291
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,903
If he but blink at the
moment of poisoning,

292
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,620
I'll know for sure he's guilty, and...

293
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,367
And I'll kill him.

294
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,730
The play's the thing

295
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,910
wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the King.

296
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:15,246
I swear it, I swear it, I swear it,

297
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:17,163
I swear it, I swear it!

298
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,550
Father who art in heaven,

299
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,300
hallowed be thy name.

300
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:29,171
To be...

301
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:52,494
Or...

302
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,030
Not to be.

303
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:09,273
That is the question.

304
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer

305
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,613
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

306
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,633
- Or, take arms against a sea
of troubles and by opposing,

307
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,553
end them.

308
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:45,413
- To die, to sleep,

309
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,483
no more.

310
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,493
- And by sleep, to say-

311
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,430
- We end the heartache of
a thousand natural shocks

312
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,653
the flesh is air to.

313
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,930
'Tis a consolation devoutly
to be wished, to die.

314
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:17,949
- To sleep.

315
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,483
- To sleep,

316
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:34,383
perchance to dream.

317
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,420
- But in that sleep of death,

318
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,750
what dreams may come when we have shuffled

319
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,220
off this mortal coil, this...

320
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,519
must give us pause.

321
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,190
- The dread of something after death.

322
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,180
- Yes, the undiscovered
country from whose borders

323
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,683
no traveler returns.

324
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,730
- And this makes us rather
bare those ills we have.

325
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,880
- Than fight to others
that we know not of.

326
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,167
- Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all.

327
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,123
- And we lose the name.

328
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,503
- Of action.
- Of action.

329
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,960
- Remember me, Hamlet.

330
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,423
Revenge my foul murder.

331
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,233
Revenge me.

332
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,163
Swear it.

333
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,249
- I swear.

334
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:14,639
- Swear it.

335
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,244
- I swear.

336
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,082
I swear it, I swear it,
I swear it, I swear it,

337
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,209
I swear it, I swear it, I swear it!

338
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:29,485
I swear it!

339
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:40,090
- Get what you can from him.
- I shall, my Lord.

340
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,023
- Ophelia, sit you down here.

341
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,450
Gracious King so please you,

342
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,450
we will conceal ourselves
behind the tapestry.

343
00:33:59,128 --> 00:34:00,961
Pray you on this book,

344
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,133
with feigned devotion.

345
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,873
Sit.

346
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,433
- How does my Lord on such a lovely day?

347
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:36,161
- Well.

348
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,043
Well.

349
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,708
Well.

350
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:49,376
- What are you reading, my Lord?

351
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,228
- Words.

352
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,138
Words.

353
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:03,259
Words.

354
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,313
- My Lord.

355
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,200
I have this gift of yours and some poems.

356
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,053
And I ask you now to
kindly take them back.

357
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,023
- No, not I.

358
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,293
I never gave you those.

359
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,453
- My honor, Lord, you know
right and well you did.

360
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,473
And with them words of
such sweet breath composed,

361
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,223
made them all the more rich.

362
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,080
Please take these gifts
you gave me back again.

363
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,413
Such gifts prove poor when
the giver proves unkind.

364
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,219
- I did love you, once.

365
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,350
- Indeed, my Lord.

366
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,790
You made me think you did.

367
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:28,653
- Well, you should not have believed me.

368
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,043
I love you not.

369
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:36,966
- Then I was deceived.

370
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,230
- Are you honest?

371
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,713
- Honest?
- Yes.

372
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:49,223
If so, get thee to a nunnery.

373
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,363
Why would you be a breeder of sinners?

374
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,690
What do you expect from men?

375
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,563
We are all utter knaves.

376
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,713
Believe none of us.

377
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,543
Make your way to a nunnery.

378
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,070
Where is your father?

379
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,590
- At home, my Lord.

380
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,400
- Let the doors be shut upon him

381
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,853
so that he may play the fool
nowhere but in his own house.

382
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,523
Farewell.

383
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,220
- Oh, help him, sweet heavens.

384
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,733
- And if you must marry, marry a fool.

385
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,260
For wise men know only
too well what monsters

386
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,163
you make of them.

387
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,233
To a nunnery, go.

388
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,984
And quickly too.

389
00:38:05,803 --> 00:38:06,636
Farewell.

390
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,953
- Oh, heavenly powers, restore him.

391
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,910
- I have seen your painted
faces all too often.

392
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,290
God has given you one face

393
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,420
and you change it to another.

394
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,000
You dance, you sigh, you flirt,

395
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,963
you cover up your wantonness
with feigned innocence.

396
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,880
Enough.

397
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,210
I'll no more of it.

398
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,847
It has made me mad.

399
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,010
I say that from this day forward,

400
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,260
we will have no more marriages.

401
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,683
Those that are married
already, shall live on.

402
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,437
Except one.

403
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,533
To a nunnery.

404
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,240
To a nunnery.

405
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,283
Go.

406
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:23,630
- It is not so!
- Think for a moment.

407
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,180
- Madness?

408
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,363
Mad for love?

409
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,730
His actions did not
point in that direction.

410
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,140
- Perhaps, but I believe
the origin and cause

411
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,083
of his wild grief resulted
from rejected love.

412
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,330
- I know there's
something in his very soul

413
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,950
on which his melancholy grows and broods.

414
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:48,580
And I do fear and sense the
end result will lead to danger

415
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,523
which we must prevent.

416
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,313
He must be sent to England without delay.

417
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,353
His death there has been prearranged.

418
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,293
See to it.

419
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:15,340
- I will, but if we wait
until the play is over,

420
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,950
his mother could all alone
entreat him to speak his mind.

421
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,860
Let her be blunt with him.

422
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,840
And I, I could stay within ear's range.

423
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,229
And if she cannot calm him, then I-

424
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:30,740
- We'll send him on a
fateful trip to England.

425
00:41:35,353 --> 00:41:37,673
To England.
- To England!

426
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,363
- Horatio.
- Mm?

427
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,860
- You are as wise as you are just.

428
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:01,993
- Am I?
- Yes.

429
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,290
And since my soul, mistress of my mind,

430
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,480
she has cherished you the
most above all others.

431
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,303
- Me?

432
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,700
- She's chosen you for herself

433
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:30,610
because you are a soul
who is suffering all,

434
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,863
has suffered nothing.

435
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,710
A man whose fortunes,
downfalls, and rewards you take

436
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,653
with equal grace.

437
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,873
- Do I?

438
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,190
- Give me the man who
is not passion's slave

439
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,490
and I will hold him in my heart's core.

440
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,167
Yes, in my heart of hearts, as I do you.

441
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,496
- And I do you.

442
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:55,470
- I can't believe I am alive to say

443
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:01,093
my father's murderer's still unpunished.

444
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:09,143
He that killed my
father, whored my mother,

445
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,020
dashed my future hopes, is still alive.

446
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,123
- How circumstances all
have turned against you.

447
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,930
- Then Denmark has been
turned into a prison.

448
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,030
- Then is the world one?

449
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,770
- Oh, a large one, with many dungeons,

450
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,913
Denmark being the worst.

451
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,313
- I do not think so.

452
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,650
There's nothing good or bad,
but thinking makes it so.

453
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,510
- Do you not think that
fate calls upon me to smite

454
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,643
my sinful uncle with my sword?

455
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:11,530
And will I not be damned if I
allow this canker of my being

456
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,513
commit more evil?

457
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,233
- And all the heartfelt
sorrows that beset you,

458
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,433
now spur you to revenge.

459
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:40,546
- There is a scene

460
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:45,957
that I have written for the play,

461
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,703
which mirrors what the
ghost described to us.

462
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,923
Observe my uncle.

463
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,650
If his hidden guilt is not revealed

464
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,660
within the opening scene,

465
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,883
it is a demon ghost that spoke to us.

466
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,467
We'll match our thoughts
up when the play is done.

467
00:46:18,304 --> 00:46:20,637
- I'll watch his every move.

468
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,543
- From this time forth,

469
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,963
our thoughts be bloody,

470
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,227
or they be nothing at all.

471
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,727
- For us and our tragedy,

472
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:45,505
we welcome you to our play.

473
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,203
- My limbs grow weak,

474
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:07,620
and now I would end the
tedious day with sleep.

475
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:23,410
- What do you call the play?

476
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,840
- The Mouse Trap.

477
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,120
The play's a reenactment
of a murder done in Vienna.

478
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,660
Gonzago is the King's name.

479
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,520
It's a navish act, but
what of that, Your Majesty?

480
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,393
For those of us with
sinless souls matters not.

481
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,410
This is one Lucianus, brother to the king.

482
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,593
Begin murderer.

483
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:58,303
Come the croaking raven cries for revenge.

484
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:07,139
- What black hands poised, drugs set,

485
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:11,903
the time agreeing.

486
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,220
No mortal is about, no creature seen.

487
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:22,480
Thy mixture rank of
midnight weeds collected,

488
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,163
distilled three times to infected.

489
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,893
With such strength and lethal potency,

490
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,747
a healthy soul expires.

491
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:45,573
Helplessly.

492
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,493
- You shall see now.

493
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,463
You shall now-

494
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:05,200
You shall now see how the
murderer gets the love

495
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,623
of King Gonzago's wife.

496
00:51:16,178 --> 00:51:17,011
- Ah.

497
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,123
- What's wrong?

498
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,093
- Lights.

499
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:29,843
Lights.

500
00:51:32,274 --> 00:51:33,107
Give me light!

501
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,073
- Stop the play.

502
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,850
- Did you see his face at
the moment of poisoning?

503
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,498
- The ghost spoke the truth.

504
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,130
- Hamlet!
- Polonius.

505
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,390
- Come.
- Hamlet-

506
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,910
- Some music!

507
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,536
Shall we dance?

508
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:11,120
- Hamlet, stop!

509
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,953
My Lord!

510
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,633
The Queen would speak with you, without-

511
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,053
Without delay.

512
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,963
- I will come to my mother by and by.

513
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,633
- I will say so.

514
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:02,739
- By and by is easily said.

515
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,880
- Easily, I will say so.
- He will say so.

516
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,000
- I will!

517
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:15,546
I will say so!

518
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,430
- It is now the very
witching time of night

519
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,360
where church yards yawn
and hell itself breeds

520
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,593
out contagion to this world.

521
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,680
But now could I drink hot blood
and do such bitter business

522
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,363
as the day would quake to look on.

523
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,163
And now off to my mother.

524
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:25,607
Let me be cruel with
her, but not overly so.

525
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,963
I will speak daggers to her,

526
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:40,703
but use none.

527
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,933
- Hurry, he's on his way.

528
00:55:20,994 --> 00:55:22,494
Be blunt with him.

529
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:29,950
I'm going to conceal
myself behind the screen.

530
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,763
- Mother, mother, mother, mother.

531
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,563
Mother, what's the matter?

532
00:55:58,194 --> 00:56:01,883
- Hamlet, you have your
father much offended.

533
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,270
- Mother, you have my
father much offended.

534
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,010
- Come, come, you answer
with a willful tongue.

535
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,000
- Go go, you question
with a wicked tongue.

536
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,563
- Don't speak to me like that.

537
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,113
- What's the matter?

538
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:20,460
- Have you forgot who I am?

539
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:24,720
- You are...

540
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:30,680
the queen.

541
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,300
Your husband's brother's wife.

542
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,003
When it were not so, you were my mother.

543
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,273
- All right then.

544
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:42,410
I'll call for those
who'll curb your tongue.

545
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,763
- You shall not budge or move.

546
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:53,470
Now hold still and look until
you see inside your very soul.

547
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,263
- What?

548
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,163
Will you murder me?

549
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,613
Help!

550
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,923
- How now, a rat.

551
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,973
Dead as a doornail.

552
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,100
- What have you done?

553
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,390
- Is it the king?

554
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,980
- What a rash and bloody deed is this.

555
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,223
- A bloody deed.

556
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,600
Almost as bad good mother, as kill a king

557
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,010
and marry with his brother.

558
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,003
- As kill a king?

559
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,523
- Yes, Mother.

560
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,060
That's what I said.

561
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,070
How rash and wretched fool.

562
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:05,272
Farewell.

563
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:08,274
Took you for your better.

564
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:14,905
Take your fortune.

565
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,033
You ring your hands.

566
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,743
But I will ring your heart.

567
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,580
- What have I done?

568
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,640
- An act that makes your marriage vows

569
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,510
as false as gambler's oats.

570
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,343
- What act?

571
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,513
- Look, here, upon this picture.

572
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:56,953
And...

573
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:05,490
On this, the true to life
depiction of two brothers.

574
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:12,690
Behold, the grace and power of his face.

575
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,180
And I like Mars to threaten and command.

576
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,763
This was your husband.

577
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,453
Look you now what follows.

578
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:29,653
Here is your husband.

579
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,720
Like an abscessed ear, pale
against his wholesome brother.

580
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,200
Have you eyes?

581
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,563
You turn from this, to this?

582
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,603
What are you, blind?

583
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:52,050
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight.

584
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,880
You cannot call it love.

585
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,610
For at your age, the
heyday of your passion

586
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:59,090
grows tame and weak.

587
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,220
Oh blush, have you no shame?

588
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,053
- Hamlet.

589
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,873
Speak no more.

590
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,433
You have turned my eyes into my very soul,

591
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:18,980
and there I see indelible black spots

592
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,303
that will not fade away.

593
01:01:22,823 --> 01:01:26,950
- I do not live and wallow
in a rank and loathsome bed,

594
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,770
stewed in corruption
with incestuous sheets.

595
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,743
- Don't say another word.

596
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,730
Your words, like daggers through my ears.

597
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,127
No more, sweet Hamlet.

598
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,060
- A murderer and villain,
a cutthroat of the kingdom

599
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,420
and the state who stole the
crown upon my father's head,

600
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,680
and placed it on his own.

601
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,160
- No more.

602
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,519
- King of shreds and patches.

603
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:55,493
- No more.

604
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:08,990
- I must be cruel, only to be kind.

605
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,110
Protect me with your grace
and outstretched wings.

606
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,493
- I come to stir your
soul, to take revenge.

607
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:25,723
Look there.

608
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:29,653
Amazement on your mother's eyes.

609
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,483
Go step between her and her tortured soul,

610
01:02:36,183 --> 01:02:39,010
but howsoever you revenge my murder,

611
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:41,620
don't take her life.

612
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,160
Leave her to heaven.

613
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,113
Speak to her.

614
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:51,050
- Please, do not come before me anymore.

615
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:55,280
Your soulful look brings
tears into my eyes.

616
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,243
- Revenge me.

617
01:03:06,759 --> 01:03:08,176
- Who do you see?

618
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,530
With whom do you speak?

619
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,200
- Did you see nothing?

620
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,227
- Nothing at all.

621
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,370
- Nor heard nothing.

622
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:19,203
- No.

623
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,760
- My father, I saw my father.

624
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,780
- This ghostly appearance is but madness.

625
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,623
- Save your soul.

626
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,713
Confess yourself to heaven.

627
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,803
Repent your past.

628
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,573
Avoid a tragic future.

629
01:04:05,122 --> 01:04:06,205
- Oh, Hamlet.

630
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,777
You split my trembling heart in two.

631
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,833
- I'll throw away the evil part,

632
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,940
and live far purer with the other half.

633
01:04:31,442 --> 01:04:32,603
To England I've been ordered.

634
01:04:35,682 --> 01:04:36,515
- I know.

635
01:05:00,642 --> 01:05:03,442
- What is a
man, if the chief goal

636
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:04,300
and focus of his life

637
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,490
be but to sleep and eat.

638
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:09,740
Once in my heart, I had a fear of death

639
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,537
that would not let me sleep.

640
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:15,370
But now I see there's
a divinity that shapes

641
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:20,370
all of our ends, no matter
what we will or say or do.

642
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,380
And life ends faster
than you can count one.

643
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,060
Resign yourself to fate.

644
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,563
Just let it be.

645
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:31,191
Let it be.

646
01:05:38,919 --> 01:05:42,297
Let it be, let it be, let it be,

647
01:05:42,297 --> 01:05:46,023
let it be, let it be,
let it be, let it be,

648
01:05:46,023 --> 01:05:47,773
let it be, let it be!

649
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:52,792
- Cut!

650
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:57,151
Cut!

651
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:06,472
- Let it be, let it be, let it be.

652
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:10,399
- Moving on.

653
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,057
- Let it be, let it be.

654
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,533
- Moving on.

655
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,813
- Let it be, let it be,
let it be, let it be.

656
01:06:37,282 --> 01:06:40,532

- They are to blame.

678
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,490
- How long has she been like this?

679
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,200
- Ever since your father's death.

680
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,773
- I will be revenged.

681
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:25,243
- There's rosemary.

682
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,913
That's for remembrance.

683
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,013
- Kind sister.

684
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,580
Sweet Ophelia.

685
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:38,581
- Pray you, love.

686
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,003
Remember me.

687
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,853
- Ah heavens.

688
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,120
Is it possible a young
maid's witch be as mortal

689
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,452
as an old man's life?

690
01:10:06,663 --> 01:10:08,746
- There's fennel for you.

691
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,070
And columbines.

692
01:10:15,857 --> 01:10:19,463
That's for infidelity.

693
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,457
There's rue for you.

694
01:10:35,623 --> 01:10:37,983
That's for repentance.

695
01:10:43,884 --> 01:10:47,090
I would give you some
violets for faithfulness but,

696
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,493
they withered when my father died.

697
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:53,380
- Oh God.

698
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,193
- Come with me, my child.

699
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,840
- Come, my coach.

700
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,440
Goodnight ladies.

701
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,053
Goodnight, sweet ladies.

702
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,950
Goodnight.

703
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,673
Goodnight.

704
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:09,710
Goodnight.

705
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:13,353
- By heaven, her madness will be revenged.

706
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:20,543
- My Lord.

707
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:26,300
I have a letter here from Lord Hamlet

708
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,763
delivered by sailor.

709
01:11:34,807 --> 01:11:36,246
- "Reverent King,

710
01:11:36,246 --> 01:11:38,837
"know that I've returned to your kingdom.

711
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:41,416
"I ask your pardon and
beg leave to see you,

712
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:46,387
"when I shall explain the
circumstances of my return."

713
01:11:48,469 --> 01:11:50,100
- Do you recognize the writing?

714
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,853
- It's clearly Hamlet's hand.

715
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,353
Leave us.

716
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,490
- It cures the very sickness in my heart

717
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,840
that I shall live to
tell him face to face,

718
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,763
you are a dead man.

719
01:12:08,809 --> 01:12:12,600
- If he comes back,
what would you undertake

720
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,059
to show yourself your father's son,

721
01:12:15,059 --> 01:12:17,100
in deed as well in word?

722
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,670
- I'd cut his throat in church.

723
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:23,170
- If he returns, I shall devise his death

724
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:26,550
in such a way shall not fail to fall

725
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,740
and make it all look like an accident.

726
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,660
So even Gertrude will not know the truth.

727
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,520
- And I will be the agent of his fall.

728
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,450
- If he returns, I'll
praise your swordsmanship

729
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,170
and challenge him to meet you in a bout.

730
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:44,370
I'll make a wager he shall outdo you.

731
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,850
He, unsuspecting, will not
notice if you use a foil

732
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:50,023
whose tip you have unblunted.

733
01:12:51,377 --> 01:12:56,377
And thus, you shall revenge
your father's death.

734
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,130
- Hell, when I unblunt my foil,

735
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,460
I'll dip the point in poison

736
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,430
I have brought with me from France.

737
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:06,279
So mortal that a knife that's
dipped in it brings instant

738
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:07,929
death with just a little scratch.

739
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:16,253
- In case that fails,
we need a second plan.

740
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:21,702
When from the bout, he
gets a little thirsty,

741
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:27,503
I'll offer him a drink
that's tinged with poison.

742
01:13:55,190 --> 01:14:00,190
- What is this
quintessence of dust?

743
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:10,419
What is this quintessence
of dust, of dust, of dust?

744
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:33,097
- A spade, a spade, for
and a shrouding sheet.

745
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:33,930
Oh, ah.

746
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,323
Pit of clay shall soon be made,

747
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:46,030
for my newest guest to greet.

748
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:50,790
Oh, ah.
- Whose grave is this?

749
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,653
- Mine, sir.

750
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,219
- I think it yours indeed.

751
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,623
For you lie in it.

752
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,420
- You lie outside it, sir.

753
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,593
Therefore it is not yours.

754
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,469
I do not lie in it.

755
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:14,398
And yet it is mine.

756
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:18,590
- You do lie in it.

757
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:21,503
To be in it and say it's yours.

758
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,460
It's for the dead.

759
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,973
- Therefore you lie for all eternity.

760
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:37,723
- Only the dead lie for all eternity.

761
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:47,510
- What man did you dig it for?

762
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,760
- No man, sir.

763
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,990
- What woman then?

764
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,170
- None neither.

765
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,219
- Who is it to be buried in it?

766
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:55,112
- One who was a woman,

767
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:01,280
but knowingly drowned herself
and would have been denied

768
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:04,210
Christian burial had
not she had been a lady

769
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,723
of good birth and wealth.

770
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:21,313
- How long have you been a grave maker?

771
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:29,070
- Since the very first day
that the young Lord Hamlet

772
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:33,293
was born, he that is mad,

773
01:16:35,221 --> 01:16:36,683
and been sent to England.

774
01:16:37,809 --> 01:16:39,680
- Why was he sent to England?

775
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,763
- Because he was mad.

776
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,032
He shall recoup his wits there.

777
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:48,763
If not, it makes no difference there.

778
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,059
- Why?

779
01:16:53,059 --> 01:16:58,059
- Because all the men
there are as mad as he is.

780
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,653
- How did he become mad?

781
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,340
- By losing his wits.

782
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,850
- Upon what ground?

783
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:13,733
- Upon these grounds
right here in Denmark.

784
01:17:17,861 --> 01:17:21,750
- How long will a man live
in the earth before he rots?

785
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,420
- If he's not rotten before he dies...

786
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,163
we have many of those nowadays,

787
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:38,243
it may last eight or nine years.

788
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,293
Here's a skull that's been
laying in the earth for many-

789
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:53,612
Years.

790
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,710
- Whose was it?

791
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:57,083
- This very skull sir?

792
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:01,034
Who do you think?

793
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:02,670
- I do not know.

794
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:05,790
- This very skull was Yorick's skull.

795
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:09,898
The King's jester.

796
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,362
- Sir Yorick.

797
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,190
- This?
- Yes.

798
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,120
- Alas, poor Yorick.

799
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,950
I knew him well.

800
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:26,950
Fellow of infinite
jokes, flights of fancy.

801
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:33,250
He bore me on his back a thousand times.

802
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:37,260
Here, upon those lips I kissed as a child.

803
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,333
I know not how often.

804
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,873
Where be your jibes now?

805
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:52,583
Your songs, your flashes of merriment,

806
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,193
that made the courts roar.

807
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:23,340
- Lay her in the earth and
from her fair unpolluted flesh,

808
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,347
may violets spring.

809
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,133
- Sweets to the sweet.

810
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:38,403
Farewell.

811
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,840
I hoped you would have been Hamlet's wife.

812
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:48,623
- Ophelia.

813
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:55,160
- Devil take your soul.
- I loved Ophelia.

814
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,200
- Love?

815
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,440
Love you call it?

816
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,840
- Take Hamlet away, Horatio.

817
01:20:01,525 --> 01:20:05,120
And you Gertrude, watch your son closely.

818
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:23,323
We'll bring an end to this shortly.

819
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:44,820
- There's a divinity that
shapes all of our ends.

820
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:02,003
- You will lose the wager, my Lord.

821
01:21:03,309 --> 01:21:05,093
- I shall win.

822
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:10,223
But you can't imagine how I feel inside.

823
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,410
- I'm gonna tell the king
you're not fit to fence.

824
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:15,623
- No, no, no, no.

825
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:19,683
We defy fate.

826
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:30,370
There is a special providence
in the fall of the sparrow.

827
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,053
If it be now-

828
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:39,120
- Then it's not to come.

829
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,733
- And if it be yet to come-

830
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,397
- It will be now.

831
01:21:45,397 --> 01:21:48,610
- And if it be not now-

832
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,083
- Yet, it will come.

833
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,213
- Be ready for it all.

834
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,383
- Just let it be.

835
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,843
- Come Hamlet, come
and take Laertes' hand.

836
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:23,593
- Forgive the utter
rashness of my actions.

837
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:30,200
Excuse my madness and accept my love.

838
01:22:30,809 --> 01:22:35,809
- I do receive your love
and I will not wrong it.

839
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:40,428
- You know the wager?

840
01:22:40,428 --> 01:22:41,440
- I do.

841
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,719
- If you should get the
first or second hit,

842
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,443
the king shall drink to
Hamlet's princely skill.

843
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,633
- My Lords.

844
01:23:05,275 --> 01:23:06,459
Begin!

845
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,643
- A touch.

846
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:26,862
- A hit.

847
01:23:28,335 --> 01:23:29,335
A very palpable hit.

848
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,833
- Come, again.

849
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:38,393
- Wait.

850
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,053
Hamlet, have a drink.

851
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,123
Come, just a sip.

852
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,833
- I'll play this bout first.

853
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,603
Come, Laertes.

854
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:07,680
- Begin!

855
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,544
- Another hit!

856
01:24:19,741 --> 01:24:21,090
What say you?
- A touch, a touch,

857
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,112
I do confess.

858
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,313
- Our son shall win.

859
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,673
- The queen salutes her
son with all her heart.

860
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,910
- I dare not drink yet, Mother.

861
01:24:42,559 --> 01:24:43,393
Wait a while.

862
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,440
- To our son's victory.

863
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,963
- Come, for the third, Laertes.

864
01:25:21,877 --> 01:25:23,960
- What treachery is this?

865
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:29,548
- My son.

866
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:47,388
Poison.

867
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:09,993
- What treachery is this?

868
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,163
- Hamlet.

869
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:15,993
You are slain.

870
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,139
No medicine in the world can save you now.

871
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,563
The treacherous instrument
was in your hand.

872
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:35,843
Unblunted and in venom,

873
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,520
the foul device has now been turned on me.

874
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:49,434
And I die too.

875
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:57,913
I am justly killed by my own treachery.

876
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:03,889
Your mother's poisoned.

877
01:27:07,984 --> 01:27:09,184
And the King's to blame.

878
01:27:56,906 --> 01:27:58,489
- Follow my mother.

879
01:28:50,782 --> 01:28:52,532
- Forgive me, Hamlet.

880
01:29:32,463 --> 01:29:33,296
- My Lord.

881
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:37,443
- I may be dead,

882
01:29:40,165 --> 01:29:41,115
but you'll live on.

883
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,973
- Not for long.

884
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:05,590
- If you ever did love me, do not do it.

885
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:17,130
What's happened here
cannot be left unknown.

886
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:26,303
Tell my story.

887
01:30:37,967 --> 01:30:39,634
The rest is silence.

888
01:31:39,337 --> 01:31:42,680
- Let me speak
to the yet unknowing world,

889
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,282
how these things came about.

890
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,000
Bloody and unnatural acts

891
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:54,170
of deaths brought on by
evil, cunning and deceit,

892
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:57,130
all this will I truly tell.
