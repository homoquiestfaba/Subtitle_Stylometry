00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,109

We have a red hot show

[cheering]

7
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:20,252
Are you ready for it?

8
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,426
[cheering]

9
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,358
We've got something
so fantastic.

10
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:24,981
We have the man himself,

11
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,535
Dolemite, the king
of comedy records.

12
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,813
The fabulous Mr. Rudy Ray Moore.

13
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:30,849
Let's hear it for him.

14
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:33,162
[applause]

15
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,138
- Dolemite is my name

16
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,969
and rapping and
tapping is my game.

17
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:53,975
I took today and
brought back yesterday.

18
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:02,950
Took the fourth of July
and put it in June,

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,405
and made leap year jump
over the motherfucking moon.

20
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,998
Holy drummers, y'all
sure beat well.

21
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:18,241
I aint lying.

22
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,968
Just look at that little
simple one over there.

23
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,384
Do you beat everything
like you beat the drums?

24
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:24,282
Huh?

25
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:25,697
Answer me, nigga.

26
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:30,184
If you do, you're
a hell of a libido.

27
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,876
That nigga looks just
like my old dumb brother.

28
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,119
I had a brother
beat just like him.

29
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,017
My brother beat
his meat so much,

30
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:37,812
every time he sticks
his hand in his pocket,

31
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:40,436
his dick would start to dodging.

32
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,886
[laughter]

33
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:43,956
I aint lying.

34
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,131
If his had have been sandpaper,

35
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,927
his dick would've been
sharp as a needle.

36
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,861
[laughter]

37
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,311
My brother's dumb.

38
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,588
My brother was so dumb,

39
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:56,037
every time he went
to a crap game,

40
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:58,488
he kept four rolls
of toilet paper.

41
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,903
[laughter]

42
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,526
That motherfucker was so stupid,

43
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:03,528
he thought manual
labor was a Mexican.

44
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,875
[laughter]

45
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,705
He was so dumb,

46
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,362
he turned down a blowjob
because he thought

47
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:12,261
he would lose his
unemployment check.

48
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:14,573
[laughter]

49
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:18,163
I aint lying.

50
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,478
[applause]

51
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:27,966
My brother's so dumb,

52
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:31,141
he thinks that 69 is
the pope's phone number.

53
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,799
[laughter]

54
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,145
He's so stupid [laughter],

55
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:38,287
he thinks Kotex is
mattress for mice.

56
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,599
[laughter]

57
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,704
I aint lying.

58
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:44,707
Same thing happened
to me the other day.

59
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:45,949
Listen.

60
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,332
I was in my bathroom
minding my own business.

61
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,438
I was up like that,
washing up like that,

62
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,957
and one of my friends

63
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,890
walked in on me and said, "Rudy,

64
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,514
"you aint no longer my friend.

65
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:02,380
"You're standing up in
here beating your meat."

66
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,657
I looked at him and said,

67
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:06,246
"Why, you ignorant,
simple motherfucker.

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,283
"This is my house,
my soap, my water,

69
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,526
"and this is my dick
and I'll wash it

70
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:12,562
"as fast as I want to."

71
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:14,599
[applause]

72
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,738
I know a girl who
wanted to have a baby.

73
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,015
She got three boyfriends.

74
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,638
You know, she laid down
and she socked her stuff

75
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:22,331
to that first boyfriend
for about 30 minutes.

76
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,608
He grunted one time.

77
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:24,885
She looked at him
and said, "Daddy,

78
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,439
"what are we going
to name our baby?"

79
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,716
He jumped out the bed and said,

80
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:31,995
"Bitch, I aint never
went for that shit."

81
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,445
Second boyfriend
got on the stuff

82
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,309
and rode it for about two hours.

83
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,553
He grunted three times.

84
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:38,761
[grunts]

85
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,970
She said, "Oh,
daddy, daddy, daddy.

86
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,628
"What we gonna name the baby?"

87
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:44,560
This motherfucker
ran out the door,

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,183
making 100 miles an hour.

89
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:49,703
She said, "I aint got
but one more boyfriend.

90
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,843
"I aint taking no chances
on this motherfucker.

91
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,707
"I want to see that
he got it all there."

92
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,949
This son of a bitch rolled
up and down in that pussy

93
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,366
for about five hours.

94
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,609
Then he fell off
and went to sleep.

95
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:00,438
She hunched him in
the side and said,

96
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,508
"Wake up, daddy.

97
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:03,510
"Wake up, wake up, wake up.

98
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,339
"What we gonna name the baby?"

99
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,686
This motherfucker
jumps out of the bed,

100
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,792
pulls off the rubber,
ties it in a knot,

101
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,241
throws it against the wall,

102
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,415
and said if the motherfucker
get loose from there,

103
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,521
we're gonna name
him Hercules, baby.

104
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:16,143
[laughter]

105
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:19,284
[applause]

106
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,320
I aint lying.

107
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:24,669
Now, I've been everywhere in
the course of my lifetime.

108
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,567
I was in New York the other day

109
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,500
standing on the
corner of a street

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,881
and a fellow walked
up to me and said,

111
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:32,780
"Rudy, you are a movie star.

112
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,438
"Why don't you help the
blind man across the street?"

113
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:37,578
I said, "You got to
be a damn fool, man.

114
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:38,821
"What in the shit can he see on

115
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,443
"the other side of the street

116
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:44,930
"that he can't see on
this side of the street?"

117
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,242
I left him standing there.

118
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:49,970
Aint got no business
out sight seeing no way.

119
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:55,078
While I was standing
there, a dog come by

120
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:58,979
and raised up his leg and
pissed on the blind man.

121
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,808
I aint lying.

122
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,258
The blind man just stood there.

123
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:04,605
I said, "Sock it to him rover.

124
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,262
"Sock it to him."

125
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:09,679
Then, all at once, the blind
man reached in his bag,

126
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,647
and handed the dog a cookie.

127
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:12,958
I walked up to the
blind man, said

128
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,685
"Sir, that dog just
pissed all over you,

129
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:19,102
"and you rewarded him
by giving him a cookie."

130
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:21,588
He said, "Rewarded him hell.

131
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:24,280
"I'm trying to see where
this son of a bitch's head is

132
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,490
"because I'm gonna kick
this motherfucker's ass."

133
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,424
[laughter]
[applause]

134
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,736
I go everywhere, I travel
all over the country,

135
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,772
and when I was in Toledo, Ohio,

136
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,774
I got on the bus, you know,

137
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,743
and a man got on
the bus behind me

138
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,365
with a damn monkey.

139
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,367
It made me mad.

140
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,920
So I went to the bus driver.

141
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,509
I said, "Bus driver,

142
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,064
"do you allow monkeys
to ride this bus?"

143
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,031
He said, "You go over
there and sit down,

144
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:51,963
"you damn fool.

145
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:54,172
"Won't nobody know you on here."

146
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,415
[applause]

147
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,521
And I know y'all know
I'm lying this time.

148
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,349
And as I say, when
I was in Toledo,

149
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:01,662
I went over to Detroit

150
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,939
and I got there and they said,

151
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,216
"Rudy, won't you go
over to the hospital

152
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,218
"and visit the children
in the children's ward?"

153
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,323
So I had to do that.

154
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,151
I went to the children's ward

155
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,325
and when I got there,

156
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,809
the strangest thing
was happening.

157
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,570
There were two little babies
in the crib pen playing.

158
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,675
A little boy baby and
a little girl baby.

159
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:16,056
All at once, I heard
the little girl child

160
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,264
start to screaming.

161
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,404
[screams]

162
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:21,924
"Rape, rape!"

163
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,928
Little boy baby looked
at her and said, "Shut up

164
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,586
"and roll over, you're
laying on your pacifier."

165
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,898
[applause]

166
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,111
You know?

167
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,838
What's wrong with you, darling?

168
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:41,909
Now that's what I
call a lot of ass.

169
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:44,015
Mama, this place
could catch on fire

170
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:44,912
and they tell
everybody to haul ass,

171
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:46,396
you'd have to make two trips.

172
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,571
[laughter]

173
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,815
[cheering]

174
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,925
As I say, I was walking down
the street the other day

175
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:00,790
and this little ugly child
comes running up to me,

176
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,896
hollering, "Mister,
mister, mister."

177
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:06,589
She was so ugly, she looked
like crime in the face.

178
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,970
She was just so ugly, she
looked like she had been

179
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,662
short stopping alligators.

180
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:12,146
She was just so ugly,

181
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,389
with her fists.

182
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:16,979
In fact, she raised the
windows and opened the doors

183
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,223
one morning and the
daylight refused to come in.

184
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,984
[laughter]

185
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,433
She came running up to me.

186
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,505
"Mister, mister, help me.

187
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,579
"I had two quarters in my hand

188
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,099
"and a little boy snatched
one of my quarters

189
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,653
"and run down the street with it

190
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:37,931
"and left me one quarter."

191
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,967
I said, "Honey don't tell me,

192
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,693
"why don't you tell the police?"

193
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:44,385
She said, "I did
tell the police."

194
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,732
I said, "Young lady,
you called them?"

195
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:47,630
I said, "How did you
call the police?"

196
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,321
She looked like this.

197
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,427
"Police, police, police."

198
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,881
I said, "Hell, can't you
holler no louder than that?"

199
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,365
She said no, so I snatched
that other quarter

200
00:08:58,365 --> 00:08:59,780
and run with it.

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,127

202
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:08,858

the other night, you know.

203
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:10,204
And she looked at me and said,

204
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:13,069
"Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

205
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,140
"I know you're
trying to hit on me,

206
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,350
"but I'm going to
screw you tonight

207
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,043
"until you are gently satisfied,

208
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,633
"and I'm not going to
charge you na'an nickel.

209
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,979
"But all you've
got to do is buy me

210
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,291
"a pair of shoes."

211
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,018
I said, "Well, god damn.

212
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:32,502
"I can always give
up a pair of shoes

213
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,333
"for a good piece
of ass any day."

214

00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,205
I rode it til I got tired.

220
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:48,553
Then I got dressed and
started to walk out the door,

221
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,831
and she started hollering at me,

222
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:55,284
"Oh Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, where
is the money for my shoes?"

223
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,493
I looked at her, I said, "Bitch,

224
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:00,047

225
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:01,462

389
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:02,693

My brother ate so much pussy,

396
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,085
we raised him up one night,

397
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:19,330
he looked like a glazed
donut about the mouth.

398
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,400
I aint lying.

399
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,680

401
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:26,993
You know, in England.

402
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:29,754
That's what they
call the Royal Fuck.

403
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:30,721
Compute it, baby.

404
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,067
You can just imagine the prince

405
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,448
looking at the princess.

406
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:34,932
He says, "Alright.

407
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:38,763
Would you pass me
the pussy over?"

408
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:40,282
And then, after she
pushes the pussy over,

409
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:44,528
he says, "Alright, I say,
should we have a go at it?"

410
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,427
She'll, say "Well, honey,
I don't mind if we do."

411
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,085
He will be in the bed
fucking English style,

412
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:50,913
with that little piece of meat

413
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,364
about to fall out on it.

414
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,194
And then, he'll look at her.

415
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,748
He said [gasps],

416
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:58,576
"I say.

417
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:02,408
"I think I'm about to arrive."

418
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,652
But soul brothers
don't do it like that.

419
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:06,895
When a soul brother gets
ready to bust his nuts,

420
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:10,554
he says, "Alright, baby,
hold on, I'm coming."

421
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:12,935
I aint lying.

422
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:16,525

Ya'll don't have to

00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:29,952
Give them to some
other motherfucker.

426
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:32,265
I aint going nowhere.

427
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,715
Yeah, this happened
to a brother.

428
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:37,028
He was a preacher, a missionary,

429
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,720
and he went over to
Africa, you know.

430
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,000
And he got across to one
of those jungle desserts.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,174
And a lion started to chase him

432
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,694
and he started running,
boogedy, boogedy, boogedy.

433
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:49,834
He couldn't outrun the lying.

434
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,457
So he got on down on his knees

435
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,941
and begin to pray.

436
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:56,531
He said, "Lord have mercy,
oh please, help me."

437
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,773
And the lion caught up with him

438
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:00,535
and kneeled right
down beside of him.

439
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,606
And the lion said,
"Lord have mercy."

440
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:04,539
And the reverend said,
"Oh thank you, thank you,

441
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:05,712
"thank you.

442
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,438
"I didn't know
that lions prayed."

443
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:09,337
The lion said,
"Reverend, you're praying

444
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:10,855
"but I'm saying grace,

445
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,133
"'cause I'm getting ready
to eat your black ass."

446
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,205

448
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,071
I aint lying.

449
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:23,696
As you all know,
you can remember

450
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,145
a few seasons ago,

451
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,046
a man come to you and
he had these words

452
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:31,911
that went something like this.

453
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:33,671
"My fellow Americans,

454
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,847
"and not you fucking niggers.

455
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,642
"Not a one of you
niggers voted for me

456
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:42,853
"but I made it to the
White House anyway.

00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:45,269
"It has been said
that I, Tricky Dick,

00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,308

I will not promise to come
to you with no heavy heart.

If you all elect me
for your president,

Nothing, if I win.

478
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,813
But I promise you, I will
have the Constitution

479
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:50,023
that will legalize prostitution.

480
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:54,096

Now, a lot of
people want to know

483

00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,912
[laughter]

527
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:27,396
Hold your head up.

528
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:28,225
Standing up here with
these motherfucking

529
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,847
Coke bottle glasses.

530
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:32,194
[laughter]

531
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,231
Yeah, I'm gonna put
your ass in the army,

532
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,716
because you look like
good army material.

533
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,304
- You can't put me in the army.

534
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,271
- I can't put you
in the army, why?

535
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,963
- Because one of my legs
is shorter than the other.

536
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,482
- Well, don't worry about it.

537
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,069
Where you're going, the
ground aint level no way.

538
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,416
[laughter]

539
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:52,007
Next question, please.

540
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,319
- Dolemite.

541
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,252
If I had a green
bottle in my right hand

542
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:56,909
and a green bottle
in my left hand,

543
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,393
what would I have?

544
00:24:58,393 --> 00:24:59,567
- You'd have the
Jolly Green Giant

545
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,569
in a hell of a fix, nigga.

546
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,329
[laughter]

547
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,987
Next question, please.

548
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:07,333
- Mr. Dolemite.

549
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,507
What are you going to
do about birth control?

550
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,923
I have 12 babies
and one on the way.

551
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:14,823
- Look at this big, fat,
burly motherfucker over there.

552
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:17,550
I bet you aint seen
your dick in 10 years.

553
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,139
[laughter]

554
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,934
Next question, please.

555
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:23,970
- [Female Voice] Mr. Dolemite.

556
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,937
- Yes.

557
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,145
- If you become president,

558
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:27,767
what are you going
to do for employment?

559
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,148
- What am I going to
do about unemployment?

560
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:30,114
Nothing, baby.

561
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:31,633
I'm gonna legalize stealing.

562
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:32,979
Can you dig it?

563
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,153
Next question.

564
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,879
Come up here, darling.

565
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:36,914
You come up here.

566
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,364
I aint lying.

567
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:40,918
[crosstalk]

568
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:42,471
What's your question, darling?

569
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,300
- Mr. Dolemite.

570
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,232
- Yes, dear.

571
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:45,233
- If you become president,

572
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,442
what will I gain?

573
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:48,754
- Darling, I'll let
you get away with

574
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:52,240
a hijacking if you pilot
a plane, can you dig it?

575
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,243
[laughter]

576
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:56,969
You're the type of
lady that I like.

577
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:57,797
I don't like young girls.

578
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:58,626
You know why?

579
00:25:58,626 --> 00:25:59,558
- Why?

580
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,559
- They always broke and begging.

581
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,801
[laughter]

582
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,492
I like ladies like you
that will come to me

583
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:05,115
with their pocketbooks
wide open, dig it?

584
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,565
- You can come and
see me some time.

585
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,498
- Alright, go on
back there, darling.

586
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:11,328
Next question, please.

587
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:13,606
Yes.

588
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:17,472
- Mr. Dolemite,
I'm 18 years old.

589
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,956
Am I a man?

590
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:19,785
- Are you a man?

591
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,096
Aint that about a bitch.

592
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,339
[laughter]

593
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,099
You 18 years old and
don't know what you are?

594
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,653
[laughter]

595
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:28,069
You're gonna have to figure
out the best way you can, son.

596
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:30,589
[laughter]

597
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,763
Girl, this could
be a virgin boy.

598
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:34,696
[laughter]

599
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:35,732
I aint lying.

600
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm looking for me a
nice, skinny gal tonight.

601
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,669
But if I can't find it,

602
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,741
a nice juicy, fat
butt boy [laughing].

603
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:47,329
[laughter]

604
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:48,779
- Mr. Dolemite.

605
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,711
- Yes, ma'am.

606
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:52,852
- How do you stand on free love?

607
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:55,337
- I don't stand on
it, I lay on it baby.

608
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:56,166
Can you dig it?

609
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,133
[applause]

610
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,170
- Why did you throw your
wife out the window?

611
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,930
- I felt like I wanted
to pitch a bitch.

612
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,277
[applause]

613
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,075
Next question.

614
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:12,182
[distant speech]

615
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:15,323
- Nigga, when you address
me, say Mr. Dolemite.

616
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:17,601
- Excuse me, Mr. Dolemite.

617
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:18,947
How come your dog
throws up his legs

618
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:21,294
when he's ready to piss?

619
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,710
- to knock his ass out of gear,

620
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,401
to keep from shitting, baby.

621
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:25,229
Can you dig it?

622
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:26,990
I aint lying.

623
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,370
[laughter]

624
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,199
Yeah, lady.

625
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,027
Question, lady.

626
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,304
- Mr. Dolemite.

627
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:32,685
I just want to know one thing.

628
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,619
How do you keep flies
out of your kitchen?

629
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,552
- Put a bucket of shit in
your living room, baby.

630
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:39,140
[applause]

631
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,968
- [Male Voice] Mr. Dolemite.

632
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:40,797
- Yes, sir.

633
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,902
[distant speech]

634
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:44,559
You can't even ask the question.

635
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,906
[laughter]

636
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:48,183
Now ask it again.

637
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:49,806
I don't know what
the fuck you said.

638
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,739
- [Male Voice] What are you
going to do about all this

639
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:52,636
air pollution?

640
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:54,120
- Air pollution?

641
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,640
Stick a cork up your ass
when you get ready to fart.

642
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,262
That will help the solution.

643
00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,194
- Mr. Dolemite.

644
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,817
- [Rudy] Yes.

645
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:03,612
- Mr. Dolemite, can you give
me your definition on sex?

646
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,200
- My definition on sex?

647
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,754
- [Female Voice] Yes.

648
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:10,171
- Baby, sex is just like
putting money in the bank.

649
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,448
Once you take it out,

650
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,346
the interest is all gone.

651
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:15,694
[laughter]

652
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:18,627
Ladies and gentlemen,

653
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:21,147
but if I get to be president,

654
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:24,772
I'm gonna make everything
down and funky.

655
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:28,499
I'll even have a permanent
cure for all junkies.

656
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,054
So put Dolemite in
the White House.

657
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:33,297
If Elizabeth won England,

658
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,059
I can damn sure run America.

659
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,681
Brothers and sisters,

660
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,579
this ends my first show.

661
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,512
I will be back in
no time at all.

662
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,894
I've got to leave these
messages with you.

663
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:45,275
Be what you are.

664
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:47,726
Be the very best
of what you are.

665
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,693
Reach out for the moon,
but if you miss it,

666
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,005
cling to a star.

667
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,461
I am what I am and I'm
going to be the very best

668
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:01,222
of what I am, and for
those who don't like it,

669
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:04,156
confidentially, I
don't give a damn.

670
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:08,056
Because I'd rather be
hated for what I am,

671
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:10,852
than to be loved
for what I'm not.

672
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,236
[applause]

673
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:28,732
- [Female Voice] Now,
ladies and gentlemen,

674
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:30,769
we have a comedy of team.

675
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:33,841
Come on out here!

676
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:35,981
- [Male Voice] Hey Leroy,

677
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:38,500
what happened to that
big, fat belly you had?

678
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,261
- It's wasn't belly, sir.

679
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:41,572
It was a baby elephant.

680
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:42,435
You wanna hold his trunk?

681
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:44,783
[applause]

682
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:48,062
Sitting back there,
doing all that talking.

683
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:50,443
I recognize your voice.

684
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:51,720
You sound like a truck driver.

685
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,170
- [Male Voice] I
am a truck driver.

686
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,758
- Back up and get this load.

687
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:57,071
[laughter]

688
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,042
I seen an old man,
about 85 years old.

689
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,147
These old men is something else.

690
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:06,252
Went to bed with a young girl

691
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:07,909
about 20 years old.

692
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,393
Got in that bed with her
around 12 o'clock at night.

693
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,464
Hooked his toes at
the foot of the bed.

694
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:13,984
And this old man,
he started working.

695
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:16,055
Worked around there for
about an hour and a half.

696
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,505
This young girl got tired of him

697
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:18,713
being up there
working like that.

698
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:19,921
And she told him,
she said, "Pops,

699
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:21,854
"my goodness you've been
up here a long time.

700
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,373
"When you gonna come?"

701
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:24,408
Pop said, "I stopped
coming 40 years ago.

702
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:25,996
"I'm fucking now."

703
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:28,240
[laughter]

704
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,828
I aint lying, really.

705
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,174

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,852
- Where'd you get

721
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,025

723
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,579

I don't like that

732
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,763

Let me tell you

736
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,423
Aint no woman in the

and let nobody pull
nothing from her womb

738
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,012

Do you understand me?

740
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:18,083
- You aint got no business

741
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:18,842

742
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:20,637
Look, honey!

- I want you to lock

753
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,413

00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:46,318
- My baby is ugly, my own
baby that I had my damn self.

757
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,491
Lock him up, hell no.

758

You better respect me.

00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,087
- Nevertheless.

764
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:58,606

765
00:31:58,606 --> 00:31:59,814
- I don't need that.

766
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,402

worry about that.

767

[applause]

773
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:21,180

774
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,045
and see if I can hit
anybody's special brand.

Tollo Taylor.

777
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,325
Daddy saw Paul Jones

778
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,672
take Lloyd Calvin's
daughter, Virginia Dare,

779
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:32,502
out riding on a White Horse,

780
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:34,469
by Cobb's Creek
near Green's River

781
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:38,266
and for a Silver Dollar,
he laid her Bottom's Up,

782
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,510
tickled an Old Drum
with Three Feathers,

783
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,547
then he pulled out his Jim Beam,

784
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,723
which was hard as
a Canadian Club.

785
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:49,001
And rammed it in
her Crab Orchard.

786
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:52,211
And gave a shot of
Cream of Kentucky,

787
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:53,385
and that started
the Wilkins family.

788
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,732
[laughter]

789
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:59,149
- [Female Voice] Ah shut

790
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:00,392
- Nobody said
nothing to you, lady.

791
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:01,772
Nobody said nothing
to you at all.

792
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,084
- [Female Voice] I'm
talking to you, nigger.

793
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:04,016
- Why in the hell you talking?

794
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,362
I aint said nothing to you.

795
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,536
- I don't like you.

796
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:07,606
- [Leroy] What you
mean you don't like me?

797
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,297
- Your breath stank.

798
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:10,885
[laughter]

799
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:11,886
- Well, if you take
time to douche, dammit,

800
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,440
my breath wouldn't stink.

801
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,787
[laughter]

802
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,688
Every man in here who suck

00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,448
just raise your hand.

804

[laughter]

805
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:28,696
Raise your hand high, sir.

806
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:30,180
That's right,
raise your hand up.

807
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,321
Got your hand way up like you

00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,634
[laughter]

809
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,776
I was at a motel the other night

810
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:41,674
and I heard you over
there talking next door.

811
00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:44,160
Talking so damn loud,

812
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,264
he made me get unready
for what I came in there

813
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,748
already ready for.

814
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:49,648
I heard him in there
tell his woman,

815
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:52,375
"Damn, baby, you sure is dry."

816
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,617
She said, "That aint me, fool.

817
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,274
"That's the sheet
you're licking on."

818

00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:02,281

821
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:04,628

00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:23,544
Are you a vagrancy?

838
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:24,476

00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,951
I will perform my smash hit,

886
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,678
Close Encounters
of the Sex Kind.

887
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:07,613
I'm gonna talk to
the ladies right now.

888
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:09,132
Ladies,

889
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,858
use what you have got

890
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,620
to get what you want.

891
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,449
You know what that is.

892
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:16,553
That's your pussy.

893
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:17,968
Use it!

894
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,316
[laughter]

895
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:22,697
never let your man come
home from work and you say,

896
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:25,528
"Daddy, I don't
feel well tonight."

897
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:30,809
Drop your drawers at
the door if necessary.

898
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,708
Pussy poison that motherfucker.

899
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:37,125
Have pussy running
all out of his ears.

900
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:40,991
Fuck that motherfucker until
he buckles to his knees.

901
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,959
Fuck a motherfucker unti
he says, "Thank you, ma'am,

902
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:45,617
"I'm pleased, pleased, pleased."

903
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:48,378
Girls, this don't make
you less of a lady.

904
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,967
This makes you more of a lady

905
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,934
because you kept the
motherfucker at home.

906
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,936
[applause]

907
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:57,180
When you get through
wrapping that good, hot pussy

908
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,699
all around him,

909
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,701
all he gonna be able to do
is lay down and go to sleep.

910
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:04,705
There's nothing better
than a well-fucked man

911
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,189
because he's a satisfied man.

912
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:09,917
So girls, I say fuck him
until he's satisfied.

913
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,919
Now, girls, as you know,

914
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:15,612
your man when he gets
through fucking you,

915
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:16,889
and you don't fuck him well,

916
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:18,443
you know what he's gonna do?

917
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,617
Get up off your hot pussy
and leave it laying there

918
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:21,894
in the bed

919
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:24,656
and go out with
some other bitch.

920
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:25,898
I aint lying.

921
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:27,314
When your man leaves
your pussy laying there

922
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,212
and go out with
some other woman,

923
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:32,698
it means that your pussy
aint no goddamn good.

924
00:37:32,698 --> 00:37:36,323
Because aint no
motherfucker going to leave

925
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:40,672
a T-bone steak to go to
Burger King to get a Whopper.

926
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,779
Even if you can
have it your way.

927
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,058
So I tell you to use it.

928
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,164
Use it for all it's worth.

929
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:52,062
And when you do decide
to give up the pussy,

930
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,547
don't just lay there.

931
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:57,482
Ladies, use the
grippers in your pussy.

932
00:37:57,482 --> 00:38:00,312
You know what grippers
I'm talking about.

933
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,003
Like when you don't
wanna piss on yourself,

934
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:03,073
the grippers.

935
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,663
Rang a motherfucker's dick off,

936
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:09,079
with the grippers in your pussy.

937
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,219
I'll tell you to grip
that motherfucker

938
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:14,361
and turn it a-loose
and grip it again.

939
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:18,641
I wanna talk to the
fellas right now.

940
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:19,918
Fellas,

941
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,092
there's too much good
pussy out here today

942
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:24,957
that just aint been used right.

943
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:29,928
Some of you motherfuckers fuck
and some of you fucks around.

944
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,448
A lot of you fellas will
say, "I'm gonna fuck you

945
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,001
"all night long.

946
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,174
"I'm gonna do you like we
did on our wedding night."

947
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:36,486
Girls, don't go for that shit.

948
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,006
This motherfucker's
gonna offer you

949
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:40,697
one hard, and you know, mama,

950
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,734
you've got to get your
nuts on that one hard,

951
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:44,805
because if you don't,

952
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:46,876
you can forget it, mama.

953
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:48,809
Because it aint
gonna be no seconds.

954
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,086
You look at him and
you say, "Daddy,

955
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,605
"you know what you promised me."

956
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,261
He's gonna look at
you and say, "Oh gal,

957
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:54,780
"I can't fuck all night.

958
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,748
"I've got to get up and go
to work in the morning."

959
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:59,129
You know that, so you're going
to make a right hand signal

960
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,546
and a left hand
curve on the dick.

961
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:02,754
And then, he's gonna throw the
dick right down the middle.

962
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:03,548
You're gonna say,
"Right there, daddy.

963
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,342
"Right there, daddy.

964
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,135
"Right there, daddy.

965
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,654
"Right there, daddy."

966
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,449
And by the time you think
you're gonna bust your nuts,

967
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,624
this motherfucker stop you
in the middle of a good fuck

968
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:13,627
to ask you something
simple like,

969
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,939
"Aint it good, baby?

970
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,494
"Don't nobody fuck you
like I fuck you, baby?

971
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:20,599
"Aint all this my pussy, baby?

972
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,326
"Don't give nobody
else my pussy, baby."

973
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:24,776
Shit, you can give it to
who in the fuck you want to

974
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:28,676
because this son of a bitch
is going to be sleeping.

975
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,126
Ladies and gentlemen,

976
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:33,336
I've just performed
from my latest record,

977
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:36,512
Close Encounter of a Sex Kind.

978
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:38,410
When I told the fellas there's
too much pussy out here

979
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,308
that's not being used right,

980
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:43,415
some motherfuckers fuck
and some fucks around.

981
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,625
So you'll be able to get
everything on this album.

982
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,662
As I say, go out to
your local record store,

983
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:49,525
and buy it.

984
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:52,907
If you do buy it, I
wish you good luck.

985
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:55,289
If you don't buy it, I
wish you severe chest pains

986
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,877
the rest of your life.

987
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,154
[laughter]

988
00:39:58,154 --> 00:39:59,086
and if that don't hold you,

989
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:01,364
hemorrhoids up on your ass.

990
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,331
Buy my shit.

991
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:05,886
I aint lying.

992
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:12,168
Yes, young man got in the bed
with his old lady, you know.

993
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:12,996
He fucked her, baby.

994
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,551
He know he did a job.

995
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:18,657
He looked at her and
said, "Baby was it good?"

996
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:19,934
She said, "No,
motherfucker, your dick aint

997
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,522
"no god damn good."

998
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:25,077
He said, "Bitch, good
as I can fuck you,

999
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:26,941
"you telling me my dick
aint no god damn good?

1000
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,495
"What's wrong with it?"

1001
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:32,740
She said, "Motherfucker, it's
got too many knots in it."

1002
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,983
He said, "Bitch, what the
fuck you talking about

1003
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:35,778
"it's got too many knots in it?"

1004
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:39,160
She said, "Motherfucker,
it's not big enough,

1005
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,336
"not long enough and
not hard enough."

1006
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,649
[laughter]

1007
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,376
This happened, you know...

1008
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,072
Young lady took her boyfriend
out with her the other night.

1009
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:56,315
He got in the bed with her,

1010
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:58,525
and he looked at her.

1011
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,181
She looked at him
and said, "Baby,

1012
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:01,355
"if I had some nuts on the wall,

1013
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,219
"what would I have?"

1014
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:06,394
He said, "Bitch, you
would have some walnuts."

1015
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:09,259
Said, "Baby, if I had
some nuts on my chest,

1016
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,433
"what would those be?"

1017
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:12,987
He said, "Bitch,
they'd be chestnuts."

1018
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,437
She said, "Well, daddy,
if I had nuts on my chin,

1019
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:16,197
"what would those be?

1020
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,716
"Chin nuts?"

1021
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:18,855
He said, "Hell no, bitch,
this time you'd have a dick

1022
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:20,098
in your mouth."

1023
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,826
I aint lying.

1024
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:26,414
I got a nice old lady,
but she's an ugly chick.

1025
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:27,864
I aint lying.

1026
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:30,418
She's so damn ugly, she
looks like crime in the face.

1027
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:32,041
She's just so ugly, she
looks like she's been

1028
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,215
shortstopping alligators.

1029
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,079
She's just so ugly, she
could scare a hungry bulldog

1030
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,186
off the back of a meat truck.

1031
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:41,499
Baby, and cross-eyed.

1032
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,225
She's so cross-eyed, she
can stand on the front porch

1033
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:46,952
and count the chickens
in the back yard.

1034
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:48,298
I aint lying.

1035
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,853
And her teeth
remind me of a 7-Up.

1036
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:54,166
She's got seven up and one down.

1037
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,789
She can't cook either.

1038
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:58,032
You ever seen
anybody burn Jell-O?

1039
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:59,033
I aint lying.

1040
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:00,345
She looked at me and said,

1041
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:01,104
"Rudy, listen, if I
keep cooking for you,

1042
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,381
"what will I get?"

1043
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:05,005
I said you're gonna
get my insurance.

1044
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:07,559
- Here's Tippy.

1045
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,769
You know, he went in a pool hall

1046
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,046
to see one of my
brother's babies.

1047
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:15,291
You know what, he looked
at my brother and said,

1048
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,189
"Baby, I'd like
for you to change

1049
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:18,950
"an $18 bill for me."

1050
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:21,642
My brother looked at him.

1051
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:23,057
"See, well, baby,

1052
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,578
"how do you want it changed?"

1053
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:30,030
"Two nines, three
sixes, or six threes?"

1054
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,963
[laughter]

1055
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,620
I was down at the bus
station the other day.

1056
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,934
You know, they got these
new computerized scales.

1057
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,833
And this brother run
and jumped on the scale

1058
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:42,007
and said, "I want to see
how this thing works."

1059
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:43,664
He put a dime in the scale.

1060
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,632
The card comes out.

1061
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,772
It said, "You are a black man."

1062
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:49,601
It said, "You weigh 165 pounds

1063
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:52,846
"and you are on your
way to New York."

1064
00:42:52,846 --> 00:42:55,745
He said, "Well,
I'll be goddamned."

1065
00:42:57,022 --> 00:42:58,299
So he saw an Indian
standing over there.

1066
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,231
He said, "Indian,
come over here.

1067
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:00,785
"I want to try this with you."

1068
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:03,684
The Indian tipped
up on the scale.

1069
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,582
Brother dropped a dime in there

1070
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,998
and the card come out.

1071
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:08,516
It said, "You are an Indian.

1072
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:10,691
"You weigh 159 pounds,
and you are on your way

1073
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:12,417
"to the reservation."

1074
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:17,215
The brother said, "Well,
I have heard everything."

1075
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:18,043
So he looked at the Indian

1076
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:19,355
and said, "Indian,

1077
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:21,322
"let me have that
blanket a minute."

1078
00:43:21,322 --> 00:43:24,084
He said, "I want to see if
this thing really works."

1079
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:27,501
Brother took this blanket
and held it over his head,

1080
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:28,744
and pulled up like this

1081
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:31,850
and tipped back up
on the scale again.

1082
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:34,197
Pulled a dime out of his pocket

1083
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:36,993
and slowly dropped
it in the scale.

1084
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,824
And the card come out.

1085
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:43,172
It said, "You are
still a black man.

1086
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:45,484
"Your weight was 165 pounds.

1087
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:50,248
"But since you got
that damn shit on,

1088
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:51,456
"you weigh 170.

1089
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:55,563
"And you was on your
way to New York,

1090
00:43:55,563 --> 00:43:57,427
"but you fucked around
with that damn Indian,

1091
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,222
"and missed your bus."

1092

1093
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,710

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,539

1098
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:14,306
I was at a hotel the other
day on the 30th floor.

1099
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:16,067

I aint lying.

1231
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,768
I met a young lady in a club
like this the other night.

1232
00:51:21,768 --> 00:51:23,356
You know?

1233
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:24,598
And she looked at me, she said,

1234
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:25,875
"Rudy, I want you
to go home with me."

1235
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:26,773
I said, "Baby, I don't
go home with no women.

1236
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:28,050
"I take them to a motel."

1237
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,776
She said, "Daddy, I
aint got no husband.

1238
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:31,398
"Come on home with me."

1239
00:51:31,398 --> 00:51:32,710
I decide to go home with her.

1240
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,021
You know what happened?

1241
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:35,161
When I got home with
her and got in the bed

1242
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:37,094
and started wailing
on that pussy,

1243
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,097
all at once, I heard
a knock on the door.

1244
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,168
I said, "Bitch, what
the fuck is that?"

1245
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:44,894
She said, "That's
my husband, hide."

1246
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,413
I said, "Bitch,

1247
00:51:46,413 --> 00:51:49,830
"how in the hell is anybody
gonna hide in one room?"

1248
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,592
She said, "Nigga,
jump out the window."

1249
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:53,972
I said, "Woman, look here,

1250
00:51:53,972 --> 00:51:55,181
"we're on the 13th floor."

1251
00:51:55,181 --> 00:51:56,078
She said, "Motherfucker,
this aint no time

1252
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:57,286
"to be superstitious.

1253
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:58,115
Jump!"

1254
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:01,842
I know damn well, I
wasn't gonna jump.

1255
00:52:01,842 --> 00:52:03,534
So I run and jumped up
over the front door seal.

1256
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:05,881
Nuts hanging down,
black ass out.

1257
00:52:05,881 --> 00:52:07,434
And this big, burly motherfucker

1258
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:08,918
busted through the door,

1259
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,541
hollering, "Bitch, what
the fuck you've been doing?

1260
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,990
"What the fuck you been doing?"

1261
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,440
She said, "Nothing,
daddy, nothing, daddy."

1262
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,234
"Then what the fuck is
that hanging up over there

1263
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:15,718
"on the door seal?"

1264
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,720
She said, "Daddy, that's
some doorbells I bought

1265
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,066
"down at Sears."

1266
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:23,105
He said, "I'm gonna
see if I can make these

1267
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:25,418
"motherfuckers ring."

1268
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:26,902
This son of a bitch
went into the closet

1269
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:30,077
and got a baseball bat
and drew back at my nuts,

1270
00:52:30,077 --> 00:52:31,493
and I looked down and said,

1271
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,943
"Ding dong, motherfucker.

1272
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,566
"Ding dong."

1273
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,913
[applause]

1274
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:41,468
I'm not lying.

1275
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,679
You know, I can remember
when I was going to school.

1276
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,199
We had a little Italian
boy in the class.

1277
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,752
And the teacher looked at him.

1278
00:52:49,752 --> 00:52:52,134
Said, "Junior, today
I want you to spell

1279
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:54,136
"Mississippi."

1280
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:55,413
The little Italian boy
couldn't help how he talked.

1281
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:59,037
Because, you know,
there aint no Italians

1282
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:00,660
in Mississippi.

1283
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,869
But he said, "Teacher,
I'll try to spell it."

1284
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:04,733
So he run to the
blackboard and said,

1285
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:05,906
"M come first.

1286
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,496
"And then a I come.

1287
00:53:09,496 --> 00:53:10,635
"S come twice.

1288
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,707
"And then I come again.

1289
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:15,985
"S come twice more.

1290
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,608
"And I pee-pee

1291
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:18,954
"and I come again."

1292
00:53:18,954 --> 00:53:20,231
[laughter]

1293
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,198
Mississippi.

1294
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:23,476
[laughter]

1295
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:25,374
I aint lying.

1296
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:27,411
And we had a little
girl in the class.

1297
00:53:27,411 --> 00:53:29,792
And the teacher
said, "Sally, today

1298
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,794
"for your spelling lesson,

1299
00:53:31,794 --> 00:53:34,694
"I want you to spell, Peter."

1300
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:36,765
Sally said, "Teacher,

1301
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:39,699
"I can't spell them old
long, hard words like peter.

1302
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:41,183
"But I'll try."

1303
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:42,771
she said, "P.

1304
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:44,393
"P, P."

1305
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:45,705
Teacher said, "Girl,
get on out of here

1306
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:47,016
"and sit down.

1307
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,571
"You're gonna stay up
here and pee all day."

1308
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:50,710
They had Lucy in the class.

1309
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,952
She was the smartest
of them all.

1310
00:53:51,952 --> 00:53:54,472
She said, "Teacher,
teacher, teacher.

1311
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:55,439
"I can spell it.

1312
00:53:55,439 --> 00:53:58,856
"P-E-T-E-R, peter, peter, peter.

1313
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:01,617
"They don't come too long
and hard for me, honey."

1314
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,964
[laughter]

1315
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:09,867
I'd like to talk about
the good old days,

1316
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:12,214
when I was a little boy.

1317
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:14,665
Well, I'm from
Mississippi, as you know.

1318
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:16,183
And I'm glad to be from there,

1319
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:19,428
but I can remember times was
hard in Mississippi, baby.

1320
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:21,016
Times were so hard, that
the Mississippi River

1321
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:23,294
didn't run but twice a week.

1322
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:27,056
Once up stream, and then
again, back downstream.

1323
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:30,128
I can remember one year,
baby, we had hard times.

1324
00:54:30,128 --> 00:54:32,717
Our crop didn't come in.

1325
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,374
I can remember the
times were so hard,

1326
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:38,516
me and my brother hung our
stockings over the mantle picce,

1327
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:42,520
and the health department
made us take them down.

1328
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,144
Baby, that Christmas,
we didn't get nothing.

1329
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:47,629
I said, "Daddy, daddy,
daddy, what is Santa

1330
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:49,803
"gonna get us for Christmas?"

1331
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:52,530
Daddy said, "You know
what my daddy did?

1332
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,636
"Went in the closet and got
a rifle and went outside

1333
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:57,570
"and shot it up in the air,

1334
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,812
"and come back in
the house and said,

1335
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:01,919
'Kids, Santa just
committed suicide.'"

1336
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:03,610
We didn't get nothing
that Christmas.

1337
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,680
I aint lying.

1338
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:06,889
Baby, times were so hard,

1339
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:08,477
me and my brother
wore tennis shoes

1340
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:11,135
Easter, Indian Summer, New Year,

1341
00:55:13,137 --> 00:55:15,104
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

1342
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,658
Baby, we wore tennis
shoes so long,

1343
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:20,144
until we wore them out up
to the name on the ankle.

1344
00:55:20,144 --> 00:55:21,628
We didn't have to take them off.

1345
00:55:21,628 --> 00:55:25,425
When we laid down, all we did
was just folded them back.

1346
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:26,978
I aint lying.

1347
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:28,255
Well, but I'm grown up now

1348
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,636
and I've left home and
I go a lot of places

1349
00:55:29,636 --> 00:55:31,120
and I went to church
the other day,

1350
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,295
and you know what happened
when I got in church?

1351
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:37,092
The preacher said,
"This morning, my
brothers and sisters,

1352
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:40,337
"we do not have an organ player.

1353
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,927
"But we're gonna sing
the hymns with no music."

1354
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:46,412
And a little young man jumped
up in the back of the church.

1355
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:48,483
He said, "Reverend,

1356
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:51,451
"I cannot play organ
but I can play piccolo

1357
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:53,211
"for your choir to sing."

1358
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:55,904
The reverend said, "Oh
thank you, young man.

1359
00:55:55,904 --> 00:55:59,908
"Alright, choir let's
turn to hymn number 100."

1360
00:55:59,908 --> 00:56:02,945
[sobbing while mumbling]

1361
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:06,052
"I can't play hymn number 100."

1362
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:07,812
The reverend said,
"That's alright, son.

1363
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:10,988
"Let's turn to hymn
number 140, choir."

1364
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:13,818
The piccolo player
said, "Oh Reverend,

1365
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:14,750
"that's a hard one.

1366
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,339
"I can't play that one either."

1367
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:20,411
Somebody in the church said,

1368
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:23,759
"That piccolo player
is a motherfucker."

1369
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:26,728
The reverend said, "I'm not
going to have that shit.

1370
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:29,213
"Whoever called my piccolo
player motherfucker,

1371
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:30,110
"stand up."

1372
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,562
Nobody in the house
would stand up.

1373
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:34,563
The reverend said, "I
want whoever called

1374
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:37,394
"my piccolo player to stand up."

1375
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,602
Nobody would stand up.

1376
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:40,051
Finally, a little
young man jumped up

1377
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:42,433
in the back of the church
and said, "Reverend,

1378
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,228
"I am not the man that
called your piccolo player

1379
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:45,402

00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:48,888
"and I'm not sitting

1381
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:50,372
"that called your piccolo

1382
00:56:50,372 --> 00:56:52,098
He said, "I'm not even
sitting next to the man

1383
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:53,548
"that's sitting next to the man

My outhouse was
different than y'alls.

01:01:12,392 --> 01:01:13,531
You know, y'all used
to have that old

1464

Sears catalog
hanging on the wall.

1465
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:18,502

1469
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:27,511
in our outhouse.

1470
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:29,720
We had a bushel of
brown corn cobs in it.

1471
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,067
First thing you do.

1472
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,655
You wipe your ass
on a brown corn cob.

1473
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:35,001
You throw that one away.

1474
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,796
Then you wipe your ass
on a white corn cob

1475
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:40,041
to see if you needed
another brown one.

1476
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,735

1481
01:01:52,847 --> 01:01:54,124
They went back to Mississippi.

1482
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:55,781
The people in Mississippi said,

1483
01:01:55,781 --> 01:02:00,130
"Fellas, I'm gonna give y'all
anything that y'all want."

1484
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,441
They looked at the
white boy and they said,

1485
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:03,789
"Young man, what do you want?"

1486
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:06,101
He said, "Well, I'll show
you what to get for me.

1487
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:10,071
"Give me $10,000 and a
Lincoln Continental to drive."

1488
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:12,590
They said, "Alright, we're
going to get that for you."

1489
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,557
They look at the
brother, said, "Brother,

1490
01:02:13,557 --> 01:02:15,110
"brother, brother.

1491
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,733
"What would you like?"

1492
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,906
The brother said,
"Well, I'll tell y'all

1493
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:20,529
"what y'all get for me.

1494
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,946
"Give me a dollar and a half

1495
01:02:22,946 --> 01:02:26,363
"from the head of my
dick, down to my balls."

1496
01:02:26,363 --> 01:02:27,364
They looked at
the brother, said,

1497
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:29,366
"Brother, brother, brother.

1498
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:31,540
"Don't you want no
more than that?"

1499
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,922
The brother said, "No,
that's all I want."

1500
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:36,131
So he pulled out that
old big, long dick,

1501
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,857
hung damn near
down to his knees.

1502
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:39,583
They put a dollar and a
half down to the end of it.

1503
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:41,240
They put another dollar
and a half on it.

1504
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,379
They put another
dollar and a half on it

1505
01:02:42,379 --> 01:02:43,311

01:02:50,905 --> 01:02:52,216

1512
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:55,668

She said, "Why you

1521

"and go and fix me some food."

1523

out one of them

1563
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:46,606
cornbread, cotton-picking farts.

1564
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:49,092
[imitates fart]

1565
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:51,991
Little white lady
said, "Oh my god,

1566
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:54,891
"what is that terrible
smell I smell?"

1567
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,480
The black lady said,
"White beans, white bitch.

1568
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,724
"15 cents a pound."

1569
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:02,899
[laughter]

1570
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,728
I aint lying.

1571
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:07,489
[laughter]

1572
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,284
My, my, my, my, my.

1573
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:12,425
Where in the fuck
did you come from?

1574
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:15,187
That's one ugly
motherfucker, I aint lying.

1575
01:05:15,187 --> 01:05:16,429
Baby, this motherfucker so ugly,

1576
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:18,915
he can scare the
stink out of shit.

1577
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,226
[laughter]

1578
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:22,953
He's so ugly, when he was born,

1579
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:25,266
his mother put him in a
corner and had to feed him

1580
01:05:25,266 --> 01:05:27,233
with a goddamn slingshot.

1581
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:29,097
[laughter]

1582
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:30,650
He's so goddamn ugly,

1583
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,308
they gave him a job standing
outside of doctor's office

1584
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,276
making people sick.

1585
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:37,623
[laughter]

1586
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:40,833
[distant speech]

1587
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,559
Now, that's the kind of
nigga that always wants

1588
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,698
to get in the show.

1589
01:05:43,698 --> 01:05:44,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

1590
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:46,252
look at this
motherfucker over here.

1591
01:05:46,252 --> 01:05:47,564
That's the kind of nigga
that will fart in a bathtub

1592
01:05:47,564 --> 01:05:50,084
and turn around and bite
the fucking bubbles.

1593
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:51,982
[laughter]

1594
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:52,810
Since you know so much,

1595
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,709
bring your ass up here.

1596
01:05:55,882 --> 01:05:57,367
Aint that a bitch.

1597
01:05:59,817 --> 01:06:00,853
[shouting unintelligibly]

1598
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:02,096
Well, our president, Mr. Reagan,

1599
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:04,443
said he's gonna give
all niggas a job.

1600
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:06,617
He's gonna build car washes

1601
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:07,894
7000 miles long.

1602
01:06:07,894 --> 01:06:09,966
- I don't want no
car wash job man.

1603
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,795
- Well, I only
have one other job.

1604
01:06:11,795 --> 01:06:13,348
- What is it?

1605
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:15,350
- Putting dick rubbers on
roosters and milking hens.

1606
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,593
- You're crazy.

1607
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,562
- That'll hold his ass alright.

1608
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:22,081
[laughter]

1609
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:24,256
Yeah, I went out with a
young lady the other night.

1610
01:06:24,256 --> 01:06:26,637
You know, at my age, I
can't get ready so quick.

1611
01:06:26,637 --> 01:06:30,089
So she looked at me
and said, "Daddy,

1612
01:06:30,089 --> 01:06:31,504
"daddy, I'm hot.

1613
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:32,954
"Do something quick."

1614
01:06:32,954 --> 01:06:34,300
You know what I thought about?

1615
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,439
One finger.

1616
01:06:35,439 --> 01:06:36,889
I stuck that finger up in there.

1617
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:37,717
Got that finger up in there

1618
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:38,684
and she says [gasps],

1619
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:39,512
"Oh daddy.

1620
01:06:40,617 --> 01:06:41,963
"Oh daddy!

1621
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:42,791
"Oh daddy.

1622
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:46,726
"Oh, your ring is hurting."

1623
01:06:49,108 --> 01:06:53,043
I said, "That ain't my ring,
that's my watch, bitch."

1624
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,734
[laughter]

1625
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:55,839
I aint lying.

1626
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,601
Same old hand joke.

1627
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:01,638
I got another young lady.

1628
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:03,536
I couldn't get ready for her.

1629
01:07:03,536 --> 01:07:04,675
I tried that same shit.

1630
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:05,918
I stuck that finger up in there.

1631
01:07:05,918 --> 01:07:07,402
And you know what
she said to me?

1632
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:08,610
"Daddy, daddy.

1633
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,577
"I got some more room.

1634
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:11,061
"Stick another finger up in it."

1635
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:13,236
said, "Daddy, I got a
little bit more room.

1636
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:14,823
"Stick another finger up in it."

1637
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,342
She said, "Daddy, since
you've got some more room,

1638
01:07:16,342 --> 01:07:19,035
"stick your whole hand in it."

1639
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:19,966
I got one hand in there.

1640
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:21,658
She said, "Oh daddy, oh daddy.

1641
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:23,625
"Stick your other
hand up in there."

1642
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,248
And after I got both
hands up in there,

1643
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:27,146
she said now clap them.

1644
01:07:28,734 --> 01:07:30,218
I said, "I can't."

1645
01:07:30,218 --> 01:07:32,462
She said, "I told you I
got tight pussy, didn't I?"

1646
01:07:32,462 --> 01:07:34,498
[laughter]

1647
01:07:34,498 --> 01:07:35,603
I aint lying.

1648
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:38,571
Ladies and gentlemen,

1649
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:39,538
I'm filmed live in the concert

1650
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:41,885
Eat Out More Often.

1651
01:07:41,885 --> 01:07:43,887
A lot of people
say, "Rudy Ray Moore

1652
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,199
"is like Pryor."

1653
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:48,305
But they're a goddamn lie.

1654
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:49,341
I'm not gonna be like Pryor

1655
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:51,101
and set my ass on fire.

1656
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,655
[laughter]

1657
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:55,726
Some learn and some burn.

1658
01:07:55,726 --> 01:07:57,073
If I ever decide to freebase,

1659
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,246
I'm gonna build me
a house next door

1660
01:07:58,246 --> 01:08:01,007
to the Mississippi River.

1661
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:02,492
If I catch on fire,

1662
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:04,701
I'm gonna run and jump dead
into that motherfucker.

1663
01:08:04,701 --> 01:08:07,531
[laughter]

1664
01:08:07,531 --> 01:08:09,154
Yes.

1665
01:08:09,154 --> 01:08:11,363
Dolemite is my name.

1666
01:08:11,363 --> 01:08:14,745
And rapping and
tapping is my game.

1667
01:08:14,745 --> 01:08:17,093
I'm the one that took the rock

1668
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,612
that killed the giant Goliath

1669
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:23,582
and whipped Nero's ass
for setting Rome on fire.

1670
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:26,861
That's right, baby.

1671
01:08:26,861 --> 01:08:30,727
I'm a rare specimen of
man, don't you agree?

1672
01:08:30,727 --> 01:08:33,005
The stars, the sun, the moon

1673
01:08:34,455 --> 01:08:38,114
refuse to shine without
first consulting me.

1674
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:42,980
I'm the bad motherfucker
that roams the meadow.

1675
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:46,881
When I fart, I
change the weather.

1676
01:08:49,021 --> 01:08:52,542
When I shit, I
whither the grass.

1677
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:56,235
The whole world trembles
when I shake my ass.

1678
01:08:58,513 --> 01:08:59,376
Dolemite.

1679
01:09:00,584 --> 01:09:01,413
Dolemite.

1680
01:09:02,552 --> 01:09:03,380
Dolemite.

1681
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:05,865
Dolemite.

1682
01:09:07,764 --> 01:09:12,596
