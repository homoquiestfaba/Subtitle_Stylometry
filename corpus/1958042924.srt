1
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,275
- Am I scared?
- Yes.

2
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,611
- Terrified.
- Of what?

3
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,113
Of myself, of disappearing.

4
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,615
Have you not observed

5
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,618
how I have given death
much thought?

6
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,161
Since I first observed you,

7
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,537
apart from all the others,

8
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,207
a young boy half in a dream.

9
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,502
What do you suppose
I saw in that half-dream?

10
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,378
Youth and beauty.

11
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,216
And, the inglorious but

12
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,593
- sa... Shit. Shit.
- No. No.

13
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,928
Something about a dull life.

14
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,262
See, you're paraphrasing, Jay.

15
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,889
I really need you
to get this right.

16
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,724
- It's hard. I'm trying.
- It's in the writing.

17
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,518
Is it?
I don't get it, to be honest.

18
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,561
Okay. Just use my words.

19
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,606
- Speak slowly, Bette Davis.
- Yes. Yeah, it took her...

20
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,775
Took her 20 years
to learn how to speak slowly.

21
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,401
Yes. Do you want another drink?

22
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,445
What time is it? Callisto
hates when I day-drink.

23
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,030
I have no earthly idea.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,782
Fuck it, his train
doesn't arrive 'til 9:20.

25
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,825
- In New London?
- Yes.

26
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,869
It's the transgender capital
of the world.

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,621
- What?
- Yeah!

28
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,706
They're all engineers
at Electric Boat.

29
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,583
They build nuclear subs.

30
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,461
- Vodka?
- Yes. Wow!

31
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,130
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,924
Actually,
I just made all of that up.

33
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,843
But it sounds about right,
right?

34
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,637
- You're smart.
- No.

35
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,888
Smarter than the guys I know.

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,181
Well...

37
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,808
Except Callisto.
He's crazy smart.

38
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,268
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,186
He knows as much as you,
probably more.

40
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,272
Well, he should
read my play, then.

41
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,690
He already did!

42
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,573
I gave it to him last week.

43
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,319
- I...
- He read it immediately.

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,029
Callisto's a mad reader,

45
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,691
been trying to get me
to read Goodbye, Gatsby.

46
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,909
The Great Gatsby?

47
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,578
Right. Shit.

48
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,331
It's the saddest sentence
in the English language,

49
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,907
- the final line of that book.
- That book is fucking endless.

50
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,386
And?

51
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,299
- What?
- My play.

52
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,426
He liked it! I think.

53
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,386
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,644
- Okay.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,266
Yeah. He did have
a few thoughts, though.

56
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,524
\ "Thoughts.\"

57
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,395
He said he'd tell you
about them when you two met.

58
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,896
There's an icebreaker.

59
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,690
No, dude,
he won't be rude or anything.

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,442
He's just direct, very direct.

61
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,111
He says it like it is.
No bullshit.

62
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,698
If he doesn't like
someone or something,

63
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,325
you'll know
about it immediately.

64
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,827
There's something
to look forward to.

65
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,370
What time does
Charlotte get here?

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,664
Um, her flight gets in at 11:30.

67
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,042
- My God!
- You know,

68
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,795
Hadrian was not an easy
character to write, by the way.

69
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,505
Does Charlotte ever
talk about Beyond Riches?

70
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,965
No, she hates it.

71
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,842
She was such
a bitch on that show.

72
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,510
Well, bitches are her bailiwick.

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,387
I'm sorry, what did
Callisto say about my play?

74
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,598
You know, he's just
a snob about everything.

75
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,224
Upper East side, Greek.

76
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,143
- You know the type.
- Yes, I do, actually.

77
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,063
My first boyfriend at Columbia
was Greek, from Queens.

78
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,106
Same church, different pew.

79
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,109
Is it kosher to ask Charlotte
about Down the Lusitania?

80
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,569
Why not?

81
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,363
Stars hate talking about
their old movies!

82
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,573
Okay, you should never trust
what you see on Instagram,

83
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,450
particularly from
old movie stars.

84
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,410
I don't!

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,120
But you gotta admit,
it's pretty accurate,

86
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,622
especially the comments.

87
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,207
That's what I focus on,
what people say.

88
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,583
That's why I'm not on Instagram.

89
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,210
- You should be.
- Why?

90
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,836
Because!

91
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,214
You're a playwright.
That's how you get known.

92
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,218
No! I write to please myself,
not other people.

93
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,887
I want to get known
by writing good plays

94
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,931
that give voice
to my generation.

95
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,641
You know, it's my material

96
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,184
that deserves attention, not me.

97
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,395
Fine. Do it your way.

98
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,356
I am acting with
Charlotte Christian.

99
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,067
Yay! Life goals.

100
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,568
How old is she now, anyway?

101
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,195
Just a little bit older than me.

102
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,197
What? No.

103
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,157
- Really?
- Yes, really.

104
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,785
I am amazed.

105
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,037
57 is not that old, my friend.

106
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,706
- Still.
- Still what?

107
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,332
Still, she looks better than

108
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,209
most of the people I know
that age! Of course,

109
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,253
I don't really know anyone
that age, except my parents,

110
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,880
who party like chorus boys
on a cruise ship contract

111
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,465
and still look fucking great.

112
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,259
Thank you,
good genes and coconut water.

113
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,386
All of my friends
are still young.

114
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,304
How nice for you!

115
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,808
How very, very nice for you!

116
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,310
What? No, you don't count!

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,979
I really don't care anymore.

118
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,772
You act younger
than anyone I know.

119
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,024
- No one can keep up with you!
- Thank you.

120
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,902
Charlotte takes great pictures.

121
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,571
Movie stars have to.

122
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,322
Her and Callisto are
super blessed like that.

123
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,408
They cannot take a bad picture.
Me? No.

124
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,285
I hate having my picture taken.

125
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,870
Smart.

126
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
I was kind of a sick
Charlotte Christian fan

127
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,999
for a hot second
there in the '90s.

128
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,585
Me and my friends used to
act out Down the Lusitania

129
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,044
in our friend Toby's garage.

130
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,588
I played the
Charlotte Christian role,

131
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,007
of course, Lady Amelia Herbert.

132
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,092
I had a dress
and everything that I stole

133
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,886
from my Aunt Cheryl's closet.

134
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,347
Auntie Cher was a colonial
Williamsburg reenactor.

135
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,225
She played the lead town whore,
according to her.

136
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,311
But I never saw any other whores

137
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,480
when we went there
on class trips.

138
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,440
She always rolled out
the red carpet for us,

139
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,066
really hammed it up.

140
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,235
She died.

141
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,112
Cancer. Smoking related,

142
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,449
but was all kept very hush-hush
in colonial Williamsburg.

143
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,367
Jesus. In the '90s,

144
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,329
I watched my boyfriend
choke on his own blood and die.

145
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,747
Another drink?

146
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,373
Why not?

147
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,084
Yes. Vodka?

148
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,753
Yes.

149
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,130
- Was he sick a long time?
- Yeah, like two years.

150
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,091
I'm so sorry.

151
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,781
God, it was a long time ago.

152
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,554
I don't know much about AIDS.

153
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,097
I know.

154
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,433
- No one my age does.
- That's a tragedy.

155
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,685
Except Callisto.
He knows everything about it.

156
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,562
He refused to do anything anal

157
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,191
until I got tested and
saw Long Time Companion.

158
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,443
Wait, wait a minute.
What... what about condoms?

159
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,278
- Doesn't believe in 'em.
- Really?

160
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,239
Yeah, he's one of those
radical anti-condom people.

161
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,909
I didn't realize there
was such red-hot controversy

162
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,203
swirling around condom usage!

163
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,913
So Greek, right?

164
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,373
I guess.

165
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,707
Of course,
he knows about my past,

166
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,283
the shit I did before him.

167
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,087
For example?

168
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,922
I was such a slut.

169
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,007
Before or after
colonial Williamsburg?

170
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,759
Before, during, and after!

171
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,678
Weren't you, like, 14?

172
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,013
She bloomed early.
She bloomed real early.

173
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,349
In fact, my first boyfriend
was head apprentice

174
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,685
to Colonial Williamsburg's
ye olde blacksmith,

175
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,062
who just so happened to be
the hottest daddy in town.

176
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,815
Mr. Luther, fucking hot.

177
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,985
I'm sure they fucked around
after hours behind my back,

178
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,237
- in the shop!
- That sounds illegal.

179
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,239
Shit. Colonial Williamsburg was

180
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,116
basically a brothel with fudge.

181
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,659
Him and Mr. Luther
still fuck around

182
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,411
when he's in New York
on reenactment business.

183
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,663
- You mean \ "Mr. Luther and he\"?
- Yeah, sorry.

184
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,165
You know, they don't
teach grammar anymore.

185
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,542
They don't?

186
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,335
But is it even necessary?

187
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,212
We're all
autocorrected now, anyway.

188
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,339
Um, I'm still a fan.

189
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,425
They don't teach as much
about AIDS, either.

190
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,011
Yeah. What did they teach?

191
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,929
No, I mean, seriously!
Aren't some things

192
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,391
still mandatory,
like history, or health?

193
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,310
Nope. We just Googled.

194
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,688
Wow. Well, The internet didn't
exist during the AIDS crisis,

195
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,232
so if you wanted to survive,
you had to fight for

196
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,808
every shred of information you
could get your bloody hands on.

197
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,072
We survived an avalanche,

198
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,123
and each other is all we had.

199
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,286
Yes.

200
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,997
Preach AIDS realness.

201
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,707
Tell Callisto when he gets here.

202
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,542
I suspect he already knows,

203
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,252
based on your current reporting.

204
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,920
Probably, he's a fucking genius.

205
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,589
Hey, you...

206
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,633
You've made some
interesting observations

207
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,718
here in the script.

208
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,936
\"It takes a whole life
to learn how to live\"?

209
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,349
How sad.

210
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,060
That's all Callisto, not me.

211
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,395
Well, this one just says
\ "Alexandria\"?

212
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,945
That is me.

213
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,448
Virginia, right?

214
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,534
Egypt.

215
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,453
That makes so much more sense.

216
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,622
Yeah, it would.

217
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,707
- Don't be mad!
- I'm not... I'm not mad!

218
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,626
Why would I be mad? It's just...

219
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,135
It's cool.

220
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,340
Where are you putting
me and Callisto?

221
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,966
Upstairs, in the bridal suite.

222
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,218
Nice!

223
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,393
My glutes hurt like fuck.

224
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,181
Too many squats.

225
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,892
Callisto gives
heavenly massages!

226
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,396
- So I've heard.
- From who?

227
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,149
From heaven's highest
seraphim and cherubim,

228
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:38,113
who ceaseth not to proclaim
his wondrous deeds and virtues!

229
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,615
Shut up! You saw his ad online.

230
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,077
- He's a masseur?
- Mr. Magic hands.

231
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,830
Very popular with
the silver sneaker gays.

232
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,416
Even has a few celebrity
clients who shall go unnamed.

233
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,334
Clive Davis.

234
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,753
But his parents are making him
get his bachelor's degree,

235
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,047
at The New School. Whoop-whoop!

236
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,091
Don't tell him I told you,
he's embarrassed as fuck by it.

237
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,927
- By The New School?
- No, no.

238
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,646
- No, by his parents.
- I know, mum's the word.

239
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,932
Okay. This bitch
is gonna go upstairs,

240
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,268
take a nap, and
get pretty for his man.

241
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,769
Have fun.

242
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,153
Serabin and pheraphim!

243
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,442
Virginia.

244
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,325
Jesus H. Christ.

245
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,577
Morning, guys!

246
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,912
Just checking in with an update.

247
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,790
Running Waters' mum
has been texting me.

248
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,459
Julie Beth said that Running

249
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,462
won't be released
from prison today,

250
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,380
which is totally messed up,
I know.

251
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,216
She thinks two legal aid
attorneys might be coming

252
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,969
from Sioux Falls
today to meet with

253
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,474
the Big Bluff tribal elders
to discuss bail options.

254
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,893
And still, the mainstream media

255
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,730
refuses to take a stand
against the oil companies

256
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,607
and to cover this tragedy

257
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,152
unfolding on
ancestral land here.

258
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,112
Well, there.

259
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,574
I had to leave the Big Bluff
yesterday for the East Coast.

260
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,496
I'm now at a writer friend's
summer house in paradise

261
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,040
for a week or so
for some much-needed

262
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,293
physical and metaphysical rest.

263
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:20,131
And doing
a reading of his new play,

264
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,636
The Extinction of Fireflies.

265
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,221
Important work.

266
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,264
Can't say anything
about it right now,

267
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,558
but basically it's about
every-fucking-thing

268
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,769
that's wrong
in the world right now!

269
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,188
Brilliant!

270
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,816
Right. I'll check
back in with you guys

271
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,569
as soon as I hear more from
Running's mum, my darlings.

272
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,613
And remember:

273
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,617
we've got to stay positive.
Can't go to the negative.

274
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,036
They go low, we go high.

275
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,170
We are the Big Bluff!

276
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,042
Vegan forever.

277
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,551
Mwah! Namaste.

278
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,471
Peace.

279
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,677
- Perfection.
- Jesus Christ!

280
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,263
- Scared the shit out to me.
- My God, I'm so sorry.

281
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,765
- Don't do that again.
- I was watching you live!

282
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,226
Don't ever sneak up on me!

283
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,313
I'm old and I smoke.
I could go at any moment.

284
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,816
Well, you look great.

285
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,819
I look like
fucking tornado wreckage.

286
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,321
That's crazy! You look so good.

287
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,447
Who are you?

288
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,491
- I'm Jay.
- Jay what?

289
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,368
Jay Mulch,
as in the groundcover.

290
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,038
Charlotte.
Christian, as in the religion.

291
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,874
Smoke?

292
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,126
Hello, Charlotte.
I am so pumped to meet you.

293
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,336
- When I was a kid...
- Yes! James told me

294
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,507
all about you.
You're reading Antinous.

295
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,843
Yes! With you! Yay!

296
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,054
You're not at all
how I imagined Antinous.

297
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,182
- No?
- Not at all.

298
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,476
I imagined him younger.

299
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,062
- Much younger.
- Well, he was 14.

300
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,691
Antinous broke the heart
of the most powerful man

301
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,318
in the ancient world:

302
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,196
a Roman fucking emperor.

303
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,115
Antinous was pure,
pious, and chaste.

304
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,825
Right!

305
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,919
He was the most beautiful boy
who had ever lived.

306
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,292
You'll make it work, I guess.

307
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,801
- Make coffee.
- I'm on it.

308
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,649
You are exactly how I imagined
the mother, Plotina.

309
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,026
Mother figure, darling.
And it's \ "Plo-tin-a.\"

310
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,235
- \"Plo-tin-a.\" Say it!
- \"Plo-tin-a.\"

311
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,737
\ "Plo-tin-a.\" Very good.

312
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,614
Plotina, yeah.
Exactly how I imagined

313
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,074
the mother figure, Plotina.

314
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,326
Exactly how you imagined?

315
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,328
- Totes.
- Like dead.

316
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,246
I'm ashes.

317
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,299
He's turned me
into fucking dust!

318
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:08,341
I spend the whole play
in a fucking funeral urn.

319
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,426
Use the organic coffee
if he has any.

320
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,560
Yeah, um, um, I'll look.

321
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,557
Yeah.

322
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,893
How is that urn thing
gonna work, anyway?

323
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,687
Who knows?

324
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,481
I think James makes it up
as he goes along...

325
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,149
What the flying fuck?

326
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,235
I'm turning into
a reptile, darling.

327
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,321
I'm shedding my skin. Do you
have any body lotion anywhere?

328
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,157
Yeah. Um...

329
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,703
I have so many
questions for James.

330
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,288
- So does Callisto.
- Great name.

331
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,249
- Greek.
- From Greece?

332
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,834
Greenpoint.

333
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,669
Brooklyn forever!

334
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,546
- You two are a couple?
- Yep.

335
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,680
A year ago, Pride.
We met on the Atlantis float.

336
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,766
My first agent/husband/sponge
was a Greek.

337
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,310
- Greeks are the best!
- In the sack, sure.

338
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,938
- Girl!
- But be careful, mate.

339
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,356
What do you mean?

340
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,400
Let's just say my Greek worm

341
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,318
stopped working after he met me.

342
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,903
Callisto's not like that.

343
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,363
He's getting
his bachelor's degree.

344
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,115
- In what?
- Business Administration.

345
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,833
Christ, another one?
Motherfuckers!

346
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,706
So, how do you see...
your character?

347
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,917
- A total bitch.
- Yes. Yes!

348
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,129
Well, that's why James asked
me up here, to read the thing.

349
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,132
And because
I'm the only name he knows

350
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,260
who maybe might be able to
get this thing produced.

351
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,638
Yeah. Has he ever
had a play produced?

352
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,057
Once.

353
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,850
But it was a failure, basically.

354
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,227
He paid for most of it.

355
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,021
Back when he had the money.

356
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,273
It's hard.

357
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,942
It's hard when you
want to do something

358
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,612
that requires
a real gift, you know?

359
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,405
Especially at his age.

360
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,240
Time runs out.

361
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,869
But he does work hard,
I'll give him that.

362
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,664
Except now it's do-or-die time.

363
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,340
- Right. I...
- Do my back.

364
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,379
I've been wondering how
he's doing it, to be honest.

365
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,964
I mean, financially.

366
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,759
I haven't known him that long.
Two years?

367
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,685
We met before Callisto. We had

368
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,849
Will was still around then.

369
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,227
My William.

370
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,188
- So cool, right?
- Christ.

371
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,193
He's a fucking Christmas angel,
dressed up as a toucan!

372
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,028
Wow.

373
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,163
How he put up with James,
no one knows.

374
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,327
Callisto had some
really interesting critiques

375
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,870
about the play, I thought.

376
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,664
At least it's better
than his last one.

377
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,749
You know, the one about, um

378
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,376
the pen pal murder.

379
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,378
Yeah. What was that one called?

380
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,886
The Pen Pal Murder.

381
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,055
Yeah.

382
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,760
Callisto thought that
the writing felt stiff.

383
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,512
Well, he's right.

384
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,431
You know, James controls
his characters way too much.

385
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,560
You've got to give us room.
You've got free us up.

386
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,653
Well, at least let us
speak for ourselves.

387
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,233
Callisto's a great writer.

388
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,110
- He did a thing last year.
- A play?

389
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,654
Yes, but without any scenes
or dialogues or anything.

390
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,489
Just, like, a long outline.

391
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,241
He said he'd find
the rest in rehearsal.

392
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,076
Well, that's always fun!

393
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,538
It's about a lesbian couple,
both Jewish, from Poland,

394
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,374
who fought in the
American Indian Wars as men.

395
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,168
I love it!

396
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,586
It's based on some book he read.

397
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,880
I need to read that outline!

398
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,717
I'll get it for you! As soon
as Sleeping Booty wakes up.

399
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,760
She's up!

400
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,929
- What?
- Nothing!

401
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,098
Morning, dearest heart!

402
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,600
We were just talking about you.

403
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,977
- I heard you.
- You did?

404
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,021
How'd you sleep, Mrs. Roosevelt?

405
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,899
I was up all night texting
Running Waters' mum.

406
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,026
Right, Julie Beth.

407
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,527
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

408
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,904
- We need organic coffee.
- And cigarettes.

409
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,031
We're running out.
How about wine?

410
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,866
- Do we need wine?
- Always!

411
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,951
Well, we've got
to stock up, boys!

412
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,627
Aye-aye, captain!
We sail at dawn.

413
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,124
I...

414
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,251
I read your script.

415
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,719
- Finally.
- I know.

416
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,341
Some good stuff in there.

417
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,469
I'd like to maybe hear
Callisto's notes, though.

418
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,137
Wait. Now they're \ "notes\"?

419
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,765
Me and Charlotte,
we were discussing the play.

420
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,059
\ "Charlotte and I.\"
We went over this, honey.

421
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,062
Well, that's why we're
doing this this weekend, right?

422
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,564
To read and
to give you feedback.

423
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,359
Daddy's gonna
need coffee for this.

424
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,695
Maybe Callisto can help make
your play better, stronger.

425
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,572
Of course he could.

426
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,617
And then we could all
smoke cigarettes and drink rosé

427
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,203
while we watch him
levitate in the backyard.

428
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,996
- James!
- I'm kidding, honey.

429
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,166
- Well, he is a writer.
- Since when?

430
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,126
I told Charlotte
about Callisto's new piece

431
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,963
about the lesbian couple,
both Jewish, from Poland,

432
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,132
who fought in the
American Indian Wars as men.

433
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,135
Wait, the foof and the what
and the... wait, what?

434
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,929
I can't wait to read it.

435
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,598
- It's just an outline!
- Well, it sounds very detailed.

436
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,392
There are no scenes
or dialogues yet.

437
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,310
It's theater. Who gives a fuck?

438
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,603
I do.

439
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,647
God, you're being negative.

440
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,816
I'm not being negative,
Charlotte.

441
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,609
Well, don't hear it
as criticism.

442
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,361
- No...
- Wait!

443
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,822
Since when did defending
yourself become being negative?

444
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,825
\ "negative, \"
it isn't the right word.

445
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,827
- \"Stiff\"?
- \"Stiff\"!

446
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:32,123
That's what I mean. You need to
be more open to letting

447
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,625
- other people help you, James.
- Are you kidding me?

448
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,795
At this point, I need everyone
on planet Earth, and Neptune,

449
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,964
and his or her moons
to help me out.

450
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,925
What we want and what
we'll allow for ourselves

451
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,593
are very often at odds.

452
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,637
Trust me, sweetheart,
I am this close to

453
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,931
drinking and fucking
my way into gay heaven.

454
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,351
Drinking and fucking?
In heaven, you say?

455
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,020
Good morning, baby.
You're naked.

456
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,529
- I am?
- Not naked enough.

457
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,899
Fooled ya.

458
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,985
You're a fucking god!

459
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,035
Get in here, you. I'm a hugger.

460
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,493
You smell like Hawaii.

461
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,163
- Doesn't he?
- Au naturel, lovely lady.

462
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,249
Au naturel!

463
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,294
Christ. I need to get laid.

464
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,630
Another celebrity client,
Mr. Hands?

465
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,882
- James.
- Chill, Jay.

466
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,968
He's our playwright!

467
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,846
I...!

468
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,017
I am a ginormous fan
of your play.

469
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,561
Really?
'Cause I've read otherwise.

470
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,855
- Don't ever listen to Jay.
- I don't.

471
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,816
- The fuck!
- We'll talk.

472
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,610
- Coffee?
- Is it organic?

473
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,028
- No.
- He ran out.

474
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,529
No, but we plan to
pillage some more

475
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,365
after we rape
the local townswomen.

476
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,075
- Ha!
- James!

477
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,910
- I'm kidding, Charlotte! Jeez!
- No, it's cool.

478
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,829
- Right, Charlotte?
- James knows rape isn't funny.

479
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,957
Of course James knows
rape isn't funny.

480
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,966
- Jesus Christ, woman.
- Fuck off.

481
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,505
Charlotte and James are
having a little falling out.

482
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,215
- Over a planet.
- Neptune.

483
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,133
It's all good.

484
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,052
Is it?

485
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,721
Is it \ "all good\"?

486
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,723
I'm sorry,
I loathe that expression.

487
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,433
I... I just do. I always have.

488
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,895
No, I mean, just...
Is feeling the testosterone

489
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,899
drain out of your body
on a daily basis \ "all good\"?

490
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,403
Is it \ "all good\" when
little kids in Yemen

491
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,655
get blown up on school buses
on a daily basis

492
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,240
on their way to summer camp?

493
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,368
Is it \ "all good\"
when 90% of mankind

494
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,953
lives on less than
a dollar a day?

495
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,080
Breathe, brother. Breathe!

496
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,873
They make testosterone boosters.

497
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:42,837
Okay. Please, do not tell me
to breathe, okay?

498
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,095
I am breathing. Now. See?

499
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,843
I'm breathing. That's breathing.

500
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,428
Breathing's actually
involuntary.

501
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,430
My brain will not
allow me not to breathe.

502
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,306
I don't have to tell my brain
to do that, okay?

503
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,976
I actually couldn't speak these
words right now

504
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,228
if I weren't breathing.
So I'm actually breathing

505
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,105
and thinking
and speaking, right?

506
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,940
So, I'm breathing,
thinking, and speaking.

507
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,484
Look, here's coffee.
So I'm actually drinking coffee

508
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,945
and thinking and breathing
and speaking.

509
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,780
Good morning.

510
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,034
I think Callisto means
\ "breathe with intention.\"

511
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,995
- Exactly.
- Well, I'll give it a whirl

512
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,962
on Monday before my foreclosure.

513
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,791
But are they happy?

514
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,377
- Who, the bank?
- No.

515
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,006
The 90% of all mankind living
on less than a dollar a day.

516
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,632
Excellent point.

517
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,302
Them. Well, we'll ask them
when we go into town

518
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,597
to stock up on cigarettes
and organic coffee.

519
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,265
And red wine.

520
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,190
And a mop.

521
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,438
Sorry.

522
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,280
I saw dirt over here.

523
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,704
I find in my life

524
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,213
nothing more
than a shapeless mass.

525
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,550
What I have not been
defines me most.

526
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:11,307
The hero's existence is simple.
It goes straight to the mark.

527
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,355
I have occupied each of
these extremes, but

528
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,443
life has always drawn me away.

529
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,448
My life has contours less firm.

530
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,404
I recognize the working of fate,

531
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,914
but too many paths
led nowhere at all.

532
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,961
And my end now fast approaches.

533
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,503
Bravo.

534
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,256
Thank you. Thank you!

535
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,882
Devastating.

536
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,010
That's huge, coming from you.

537
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,931
- You found so many levels.
- It felt really good.

538
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,935
Yes, well.
You can't teach levels, baby.

539
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,272
You either have them
or you don't.

540
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,982
I did change a few of the words.

541
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,858
You personalized it.

542
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,653
Good actors do that. We all do.

543
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,989
Quite a bit, actually.

544
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,157
You gave it oomph!

545
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,666
Well, someone had to.

546
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,955
Great writers need
better editors, right?

547
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,457
- Is that a quote?
- No, I just came up with it.

548
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,966
Brilliant.

549
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,922
\"I find in my life...

550
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,383
nothing more than
a shapeless mass.

551
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,477
What I have not been
defines me most.\"

552
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,023
We can all relate.

553
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,228
I don't want
to end up like that.

554
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,022
Like Euphrates?

555
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,231
Right!

556
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,649
Now

557
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,693
you have too much potential.

558
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,362
I mean, look at you.
You've got it all.

559
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:59,950
The face, the brains,
the body, the talent.

560
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,995
I read your play, by the way.

561
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,998
- Well, most of it.
- When?

562
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,875
Jay gave it to me this morning,

563
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,127
right before they went
to get our groceries.

564
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,005
- It's just an outline.
- No, it's brilliant.

565
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,673
That's what it is, mate.

566
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,383
The world needs to hear it.

567
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,059
The universe needs you
to tell that story.

568
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,812
So timely.

569
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:28,318
The genocide of
Native Americans continues.

570
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,026
I saw it last week with
my own eyes. I have videos.

571
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,196
None of this shit has changed,
and you're writing about it.

572
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,365
- It's fucking brilliant.
- Wow.

573
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,492
Thanks.

574
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:45,204
And you do massage?

575
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,164
I am a massage therapist, yes.

576
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,626
How about reflexology?

577
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,170
Yes, I studied in Shanghai.

578
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,762
Do my feet!

579
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,259
Aww. Christ, what a grip!

580
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,929
You have such soft skin.

581
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,849
- Don't!
- You smell so pure.

582
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,935
I am.

583
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:12,356
Why, I'm just a delicate
little hothouse flower.

584
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,942
Blanche fucking Dubois!

585
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,111
Now there's a part.

586
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,739
But I'm running out of time
to play that one, and fast.

587
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,409
That's good.

588
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,370
You went to China
to learn how to rub feet?

589
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,996
My dad was there
doing business for a year

590
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,029
when I was on break
from Deerfield.

591
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:35,671
You live up to your name,
Mr. Hands.

592
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,382
God, you'd make a killing
in Los Angeles.

593
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,801
They're always on the hunt
for body workers out there.

594
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,970
Daddy would murder me

595
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,232
if I didn't finish
my school this time.

596
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,524
Need to finish something.

597
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,692
Anything.

598
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,148
\"Time to get serious, Carly.

599
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,900
Your mother and I,
we're getting too old for this.

600
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,653
Too many bites at the apples.\"

601
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,697
Aww. They love you.

602
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,408
I'm such a fuck-up.

603
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,598
What?

604
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,911
My dad wants me
in the shipping business.

605
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,707
Plus, Jay doesn't want
to leave New York.

606
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,710
He loves it,
and my family loves him.

607
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,629
Go figure, right?

608
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,175
They want us to get married.
My mother wants grandkids.

609
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,724
Well, what do you want?

610
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,013
I don't want to disappoint them.

611
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,600
Well, I never gave two shits
about disappointing anyone.

612
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,853
I saw something and
I just fucking went for it.

613
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:36,023
Never got married,
never had babies, so

614
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,256
there's never been anyone there
that I could disappoint.

615
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,870
Do I have regrets?

616
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,914
Fuck yes.

617
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,204
I regret I didn't get married,
I regret...

618
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,171
I never had babies.

619
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,336
I'm contradicting myself,
I know, but

620
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:02,591
those regrets were zilch
compared to the ones I'd had

621
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,101
had I not pursued
my hero's existence.

622
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,396
Had I not lived

623
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,108
straight to the mark.

624
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,408
Sounds lonely.

625
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,823
I got over all that shit
a long time ago,

626
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,283
and now I'm out of cigarettes!

627
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,286
- We're back!
- Thank God!

628
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,248
- Did you get my cigarettes?
- Yes, ma'am.

629
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,126
One, two, three.

630
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,545
From the tribal smoke shop.

631
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,214
Autumn Leaf sends her regards,
by the way.

632
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,841
Autumn's a peach.

633
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,759
- And guess what I got?
- What?

634
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,886
New coloring book. Yay!

635
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,763
- Ever color?
- Are you kidding?

636
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,181
You should try it!

637
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,308
It's a great time-killer,
like knitting.

638
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,853
Callisto and I were
just deciding your future.

639
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,188
- Really?
- I'm all ears.

640
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,731
We're gonna get married
and have lots of babies,

641
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,233
right, Calli?

642
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,818
Toss me that knitting,
will you, darling?

643
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,988
Callisto was reciting
Euphrates' death plea.

644
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,575
Was this before or after
your backyard symposium

645
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,494
- on gays and procreating?
- He's a natural.

646
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,913
Baby, go and show
James your rewrites.

647
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,540
- Wait, rewrites?
- \ "Baby\"?

648
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,209
Just a few, to make it
more conversational.

649
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,045
Um, he's an emperor
on his deathbed,

650
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,631
surrounded by the Praetorian
Guard and the Roman Senate.

651
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,717
- He's not Chatty Cathy.
- I also screwed around

652
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,719
a little bit with
Hadrian's Greece speech.

653
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,053
Oy, that.

654
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,763
Before Euphrates kills himself,

655
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,808
the scene with
Antinous in Alexandria.

656
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,727
Egypt, case you're wondering.

657
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,604
- Thank you, John.
- John?

658
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,147
I love it. It's mad good.

659
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,274
You made it
more \ "conversational.\"

660
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,151
It just wasn't flowing.

661
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,320
- Exactly.
- Interesting.

662
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,780
- It was flowing for me.
- Well, I reworked a few words

663
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,074
and a sentence or two
here and there to make it

664
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,701
land better with
a younger audience.

665
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,620
- Important point.
- But what if I don't want it

666
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,954
to land better with
a younger audience?

667
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,789
- Why not?
- You don't?

668
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,708
- What? Everyone wants that.
- Hey, maybe we read the play

669
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,209
out loud before we rip it apart?

670
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,004
- Sure.
- So wise. You're right.

671
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,966
It was massively uncool
of me to touch a single word

672
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,969
of your awesome play
without your permission.

673
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,888
- I apologize.
- No, it's...

674
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,557
Oof, he is stiff. I need
to work on you, sexy man.

675
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,017
He Worked on me earlier.

676
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,269
Miss Dubois and I had a session.

677
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,772
He made my mouth water.

678
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,649
That sounds murky.

679
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,610
Okay, you know what?
Thank you. Thank you.

680
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,445
And thank you for the apology.

681
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,530
I honor your need
not to change things.

682
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,407
There's a lesson
in that for all of us.

683
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,867
Ew.

684
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,535
So evolved,
this young man right here.

685
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,787
It's all the hot yoga.

686
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,288
- Namaste...
- Namaste...

687
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,706
Jinx! You owe me a beer.

688
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,959
I owe you nothing.

689
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,921
Okay. Anyway, I got us
some nice fish for tonight.

690
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,674
- No salmon, I hope.
- Nope, fresh tuna.

691
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,842
- Okay.
- Jinx again!

692
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,136
Wait, wait, wait.

693
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,888
What happened now
to salmon and tuna?

694
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:59,101
Anything from the Pacific
is 1000% carcinogenic.

695
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,894
The Atlantic too. 1000%.

696
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,063
- I heard that.
- 1000%.

697
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,273
- I saw it online.
- And on NPR.

698
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,609
Well!

699
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,994
We're all so fucked!

700
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,548
I love this one.

701
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,128
It's a unicorn.

702
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,755
I collect unicorns. See it?

703
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,341
I see it. Yes.

704
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,100
Show it to James.

705
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,606
James?

706
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,820
Do you see it, James?

707
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,991
Do you see the unicorn?

708
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,625
The stars...

709
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,502
My God. They're

710
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,297
falling from the sky.

711
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,966
They're really good.

712
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,010
Bithynia has gorgeous stars.

713
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,095
- Greece?
- No, Turkey.

714
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,306
My grandpa lived there,

715
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,475
in a villa he built
on the Black Sea

716
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:26,188
before he died in
his plane off Icaria.

717
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,024
The island where
people forget to die.

718
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,651
Christ! Let's go there.

719
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,119
We visited him every July.

720
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,785
Papa would drink ouzo
with Sprite every night,

721
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,371
tell me and my sister
the story of the stars.

722
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,415
Artemis?

723
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,042
Jay hates my sister.

724
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,794
She thinks I'm not
good enough for her brother.

725
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,921
- She never said that.
- Whatever.

726
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,154
She should see a nutritionist.
That's all I'm gonna say.

727
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,344
What about your grandma?

728
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,020
Yiayia Merope.

729
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,308
She drowned the year
my dad was born.

730
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,977
So much tragedy.

731
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,277
Yes.

732
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,030
Papa never got over it.

733
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,403
Yiayia Merope was named after
the seventh Pleiad, Merope,

734
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,323
who married Sisyphus,
a mere mortal.

735
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,117
Her sisters shunned her for it.

736
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,619
Poor Merope.

737
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,746
Papa said you could
only see Merope

738
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,165
when it was cold and clear

739
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,752
\ "and the air was a corpse.\"

740
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,553
We looked for her every night.

741
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,847
We never found her.

742
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,136
Papa said he only saw her

743
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:43,396
in the iron sky of
the January new moon.

744
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,106
But we were never
there to see that.

745
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,938
Beautiful, right?

746
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,482
Fuck yeah.

747
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,401
Everybody comfy-cozies?

748
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,361
Yes, Daddy.

749
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,907
You missed the fabulous
story of Yiayia and Merope.

750
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,868
Sounds mythological.

751
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,204
That's my childhood.
All mythology.

752
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,957
Mine was all New England.

753
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,834
The only mythology
we ever heard was that

754
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,711
Dad wasn't
drinking himself to death.

755
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,254
My mom says
the same thing to my dad,

756
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,755
but she's just giving him
a hard time.

757
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,215
Sometimes, I wonder.

758
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,426
Wonder about what?

759
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,386
His dad's a freak
of a booze hound.

760
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,679
Freak?

761
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,431
He's a lawyer. You'd hate him.

762
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,682
Probably.

763
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,941
- Wanna hit this?
- Yeah, sure.

764
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,443
Wow. Okay.

765
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,112
Let's just
continue with the play.

766
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,156
- So disrespectful, Calli.
- Sure.

767
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,116
- Why not?
- Why'd you say that?

768
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,910
I'm gonna refresh
my drink, ladies.

769
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,287
- You say it all the time, babe.
- Make me one, too.

770
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,456
Jay, darling? Drink?

771
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,791
I'll have a baby vodka.
I'm kind of wasted.

772
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,835
Good idea.

773
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,214
I'll make baby's vodka.

774
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,007
I'm pumped
you two are hitting it off.

775
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,717
- I was worried.
- That's enough.

776
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,178
Okay, boys. And girl.

777
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,680
So, we got to
Euphrates' suicide, right?

778
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,307
No, we're still on that.

779
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,434
- The scene before.
- Shit. Okay.

780
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,521
Christ, this thing is long.

781
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,022
I like this scene.

782
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,815
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

783
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,193
Thoughts? Notes? Revisions?

784
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,904
No. It's just heartbreaking.

785
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,698
- You got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,076
No tea, no shade,
but this says a lot about you.

787
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,828
All my older gay clients
romanticize their past.

788
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,456
Well,
we silver sneakers usually do.

789
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,625
Really?

790
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:38,046
That's why you wrote
this Russian novel of a play?

791
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,968
To romanticize your personal
crisis as an aging gay man,

792
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,888
as seen through the eyes of

793
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,934
a second-century Roman emperor
and his 14-year-old boy-toy?

794
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:54,271
We are children, my generation.

795
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,523
- No, we're not.
- Yes, you are.

796
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,983
We're actually
more sophisticated.

797
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,569
- Baby vodka?
- Thank you!

798
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,530
No, it's like,
everything's changed now.

799
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,657
And nothing I remember
is there anymore.

800
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,659
And what about
what I don't remember

801
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,369
remembering being there?

802
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,621
I... I feel like a phantom.
Like... like

803
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,417
an age-inappropriately-dressed
phantom, just lurking...

804
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,586
Lurching around New York City

805
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,338
with a nasty case of
plantar fasciitis.

806
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:25,427
Now, many people... not me,
of course, but most... well,

807
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,888
let's call them, quote-unquote,
\ "older people\" I know...

808
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,142
-Quote-unquote, \ "your peers.\"
-Well, if you will...

809
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:35,228
See, they romanticize
their past because

810
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,149
they're utterly traumatized
by what's coming down the pipe.

811
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,401
Well, this is different.

812
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,030
You actually think you had it
better than today's young gays?

813
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,490
Absolutely. Yes, I do.

814
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,702
Despite all the AIDS and
the stigma and inequality,

815
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,996
and the no marriage
and no kids...

816
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,332
- What?
- Not on the page,

817
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,792
not on the stage,
right, Callisto?

818
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,377
I'm the wrong person to ask.

819
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,546
Wait. Charlotte,
why does this threaten you?

820
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,967
Are you serious? I was the one
marching and protesting

821
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,844
to save your lives,
you remember?

822
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:12,223
And all the gays thank you.
Didn't you get our card?

823
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,602
I lost out of the biggest job
of my career because of it.

824
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,771
- Wait a minute.
- No, it's true.

825
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,814
No, it was way more
complicated than that.

826
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,566
No,
it wasn't complicated, James.

827
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,985
Okay. 1992, right?

828
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,406
I was flat-out fired
from the Lusitania sequel.

829
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,785
The front page of Variety,
the whole bit.

830
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,455
And then, if you will recall,

831
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,832
I was blacklisted in Hollywood

832
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,503
by the studio that made
$1 billion off me because

833
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,507
I sued them because they
refused to hire gay actors.

834
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:50,095
Your peers, whom they
branded \ "production risks.\"

835
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,305
Christ.

836
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,726
I had to finally grovel
and take that shit part

837
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,604
on Beyond Riches.

838
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,065
Christ, I was so fucking broke.

839
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:06,319
A crap show that crowned me
\ "Hollywood's biggest bitch\"!

840
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,406
You were in the running
long before that, honey lamb.

841
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,074
Go to hell.

842
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,243
My God, Beyond Riches is, like,

843
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,495
the greatest
television show ever made.

844
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,046
It was a colossal
piece of shit, honey.

845
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,043
And Down the Lusitania 2

846
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,381
was a career-ending epic flop
for everyone involved.

847
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,300
You dodged a major bullet
on that deal, sweetheart.

848
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,262
A sequel to a movie
about a sinking ship?

849
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,472
There were survivors, arsehole.

850
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,516
Let's agree to disagree.

851
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,435
We never acted it out.

852
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,563
Down The Lusitania 2 never
came to our movie theater.

853
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,947
You acted out my movie?

854
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,068
With costumes.

855
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,530
Nicked from a hooker
in colonial Williamsburg.

856
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,157
It was quite the production.

857
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,117
- Shit!
- I played you, of course.

858
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,785
\"Lady Amelia Herbert,

859
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,788
cabin E14. Do drop in.\"

860
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,382
- Aww. How old were you?
- 14, 15?

861
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,089
So, Euphrates kills himself?

862
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,341
Yes.

863
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,809
Wow. Okay.

864
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,577
I thought you'd be grateful.

865
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,099
- Grateful?
- Yes, grateful.

866
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,018
Adverb of \ "gratitude.\"
Ever heard of it?

867
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,395
- It's actually an adjective...
- Grateful and honored that

868
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,314
some sad little
gay boy in a dress

869
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,483
in Tidewater, Virginia
wanted to be you.

870
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,985
Whilst sleeping with
ye olde blacksmith!

871
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,737
Ye olde blacksmith's
head apprentice.

872
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,156
- Get your story straight.
- It's your story, honey.

873
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,450
When and if you're
ever honored like that,

874
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,584
do drop in and we'll talk.

875
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,624
Are you serious?

876
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,875
What?

877
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,091
\ "If\"?

878
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,464
Yes. \ "If.\"

879
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,300
You don't think
I'm good enough to make it?

880
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,603
Well, I'm just perceiving
and reading between the lines.

881
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,725
Whatevs, Lady A.

882
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,227
- Jay...
- Let's keep reading.

883
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,062
- Good idea.
- What page?

884
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,403
28.

885
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,358
Fix me another drink, Adonis.

886
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,819
Here we go.
Jay, did you day drink?

887
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,571
Who the hell had time?
We were too busy chasing down

888
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,032
cheap booze and
organic smokes from here

889
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,701
to East Jesus and back.
Right, James?

890
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,662
I still can't believe we
trucked our butts all the way

891
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:25,250
to a fucking Indian reservation
to pick up organic smokes.

892
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,420
Who the fuck smokes
\ "Minnihana Lights\"?

893
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,215
Excuse me? First of all,

894
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,634
\"Native American, \"
not \"Indian.\"

895
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,554
And I smoke Minnihana Lights

896
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,640
to support the tribal women
who make them.

897
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,351
All right,
let's all calm down, okay?

898
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,895
- Jay...
- What? I'm calm. I'm calm as

899
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,356
a motherfucking cucumber.
Where's my fucking drink?

900
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,732
I might go to bed.

901
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,317
You're not going anywhere,
Lady A.

902
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,152
- No, Charlotte, please.
- Here, come sit with me.

903
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,781
Okay. Protect me from
your future husband.

904
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,366
And the mother of your children.

905
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,201
Yes, you two sit there
nice and pretty.

906
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,371
\"Perceiving and
reading between the lines.\"

907
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,498
All right, I'll read Hadrian.

908
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,083
- You do that.
- Jay, enough.

909
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,718
Relax! Toss me
a Minnihana Light, Lady A!

910
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,716
Lighter!

911
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,218
Would you like me
to smoke it for you as well?

912
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,053
I hate when he day drinks.

913
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,515
What? I'm just
getting into character.

914
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,065
What's wrong with that?

915
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,862
Hit it, Hadrian.

916
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,860
\"You are flushed and confused.

917
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,363
Your voice is low and strange.
What torments you?\"

918
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,656
\ "Nothing.\"

919
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,325
\"Your eyes look straight at me,

920
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,118
yet they lack the gentleness
that I marvel.\"

921
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,828
\ "So?\"

922
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,456
\"I feel judged with
harshness and suspicion,

923
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,167
and not as a god
by his adorer.\"

924
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,504
\"You are absolute master over
but one being... mine.\"

925
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,089
\"Then where is my boy,

926
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,342
ready to cast off his dagger
and belt of gold

927
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,886
-to lie with his master?\"
-Okay, hold up, hold up, y'all.

928
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,138
\ "Belt of gold\"? What is that?

929
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,015
Just what it sounds like.

930
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:08,109
Yeah, it's a belt made
out of gold for your dagger.

931
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,814
- Okay.
- While we're stopped,

932
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,776
I do not believe that this man

933
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,153
is the absolute master
of your being.

934
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,155
But is he? Look at him.

935
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,407
- He is.
- You're 14.

936
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,410
Why do I take my own life then?

937
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,788
For the same reason
Euphrates takes his.

938
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,248
- You've read Hamlet, right?
- Of course I have.

939
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,459
I know, I know:
\ "To me or not to me.\"

940
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,169
- Jesus.
- What's your point?

941
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,136
Okay, let's continue.

942
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:44,138
\"Why do you charge me to carry
to Euphrates your permission?\"

943
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,265
\"He is sick. He is old.

944
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,267
His life no...
No longer offers him

945
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,977
-anything worth the living.\"
-Depressing.

946
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,729
Hey, why are you so petulant?

947
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,440
- You sound like Bette Davis.
- James!

948
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,735
You know, maybe I'd like
to hear Callisto in the part.

949
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,076
Shit.

950
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,323
Would you now, maybe?

951
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,367
It's Jay's part. No.

952
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:08,705
Would the playwright
like to maybe hear Callisto

953
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,713
- in the part?
- James.

954
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,668
- No?
- Of course you would.

955
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,753
- Be honest.
- Okay, yeah, maybe.

956
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,262
Maybe? Maybe

957
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,593
\"it's creepy that some
lecherous old dude lusts after

958
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,722
a 14-year-old boy he picked up
on a camping trip.\"

959
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,098
- Lecherous?
- Camping trip?

960
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,641
- Jay.
- Your words, Callisto,

961
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,059
- not mine.
- He's drunk.

962
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,811
- He's drunk...
- No. No! It's right here,

963
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,301
in black and white
and fuchsia highlighter.

964
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,152
\"Isn't it creepy that
some lecherous old dude

965
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:43,114
lusts after a 14-year-old boy
he picked up...\"

966
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,997
\ "...on a camping trip?\"

967
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:09,432
- You can be a supreme asshole.
- Why did you do that?

968
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,142
- Do what?
- You upset him.

969
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,186
- This is everything to him.
- He is a mess.

970
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,397
Am I? Isn't this what
we're doing here this weekend,

971
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,484
reading and giving feedback?
Your feedback, as it were.

972
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,736
- Show a little class.
- Here we go.

973
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,488
Lover,
pour me another glass of wine.

974
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,323
Pour your own
damn glass of wine.

975
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,241
Now I'm definitely going to bed!

976
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,786
No, Jay is... Please. He's...
Jay's not in his right mind.

977
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,537
Are you kidding?
I feel fabulous.

978
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,671
Fuckin' done. Done with that.

979
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,513
Want company...

980
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,975
James.

981
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,084
Sanctuary is left open...

982
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,884
Sacked by Nero.

983
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,631
Corinth in ruins,

984
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,474
yet Greece lives on.

985
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,388
Unchanged since
Aeacus first breathed in

986
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,391
the lavender honey in mirth.

987
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,935
Palestra's rugged shore,

988
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:40,488
where Charmides and Socrates
wrestle no more.

989
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,413
- How was your swim?
- Great.

990
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,869
Was the water warm?

991
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,210
Perfect.

992
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,500
Did any of the
ancient peoples see you?

993
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,385
- Ancient peoples?
- My neighbors.

994
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,256
Want another drink?

995
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,848
- I'll take a beer, sure.
- You got it.

996
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,312
Sorry about earlier.

997
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,059
That whole mess with
Jay and your script.

998
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,854
It's all right.

999
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,064
- I'm used to it.
- He's very direct.

1000
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,816
Says it like it is.

1001
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,360
Funny, he says
the same thing about you.

1002
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,988
I didn't understand
the attraction at first.

1003
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,699
- Now I do.
- Okay.

1004
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,957
Seriously.

1005
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,585
I believe you.

1006
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,292
And for the record,

1007
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,544
Hadrian did not pick up Antinous

1008
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,756
on a camping trip, okay?
It was a barbecue.

1009
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:50,134
No, it was. Seriously.

1010
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,219
Where do you think
barbecues came from?

1011
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,348
Yeah. Antinous, he was a hottie.

1012
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,892
I mean, he was... oof!

1013
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,062
The Romans, they treated
foreigners just like animals.

1014
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,149
I mean, to them,
he was just a... human sex toy.

1015
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,068
Tell me more.

1016
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,570
Well, they fed each other
grapes,

1017
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,614
and then they banged
each other's brains out

1018
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,407
from Britain
to Bethania and back.

1019
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,827
I know it well.

1020
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,838
But, their love endured.

1021
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,508
To Hadrian and Antinous.

1022
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,601
It's heaven here.

1023
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,431
I love your place.
Your patio, your fountain.

1024
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,142
I love this fountain!

1025
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,645
Did you do all this yourself?

1026
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,689
No. None of it.

1027
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,108
- Who did?
- William.

1028
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,403
- William, your gardener?
- No, William, my life partner.

1029
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,829
My... ex-life partner,
as it were.

1030
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,292
He made everything
here beautiful.

1031
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,665
I mean, I'm barely
holding it all together.

1032
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,709
This is bad.

1033
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,714
You should see this garden
when Will was tending it.

1034
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,555
It was our sanctuario.

1035
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,567
Did you

1036
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,113
did you see any fireflies?

1037
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,825
- I saw a few down at the docks.
- Yeah?

1038
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,904
You see that,
row of pine trees there

1039
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,364
along the property line?

1040
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,074
Yes, I love them.

1041
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,870
Yeah, they used to twinkle,
just yellow and green.

1042
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,955
Like Christmas in July.

1043
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,499
Not anymore.

1044
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,049
Damn.

1045
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,762
You ever hear
a nightingale sing?

1046
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,555
Wait, nightingales exist?

1047
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,265
- What?
- I don't know.

1048
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,351
- Yes! Of course they do!
- I was... I'm mistaken.

1049
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,354
I always thought they were
magical fairy tale birds,

1050
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,566
like... like mermaids
and dragons.

1051
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,818
- No!
- Okay.

1052
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,493
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1053
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,657
So, how does a nightingale sing?

1054
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,619
Like it can't decide
what song to sing.

1055
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,497
So it stays up all night
and sings 'em all,

1056
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,881
like Judy at Carnegie Hall.

1057
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,259
Who's Judy?

1058
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,694
Nobody.

1059
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,181
Just an old friend.

1060
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,683
From a fairy tale.

1061
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,978
You are so cute.

1062
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,225
Be grateful for the compliment.

1063
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,395
Well, thank you!
I shall treasure it always.

1064
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,271
- Stop.
- No, I'm just...

1065
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,816
I'm just uncomfortable.
I'm just really uncomfortable.

1066
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,609
I'm just, like,
Woody Allen uncomfortable.

1067
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,870
I know him!
He... married his daughter.

1068
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,742
Yeah. I mean, well...

1069
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,286
- Take this off.
- No, I'm good.

1070
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,539
Take off the dang shirt, Woody.

1071
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:10,084
Okay, okay. All right.
I'll take one for the team.

1072
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,051
How do I...

1073
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,474
Just gonna make sure...

1074
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,847
Wait...

1075
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,265
You're not very
good at this, are you?

1076
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,933
Like, good at what?

1077
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,227
Letting a boy have
his way with you?

1078
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,521
- Your fiancé...
- He knows.

1079
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,064
He knows you're
having your way with me?

1080
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,732
No.

1081
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,449
That I like older men.

1082
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,863
- Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

1083
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:42,456
I'm totally relaxed. This is...
I'm not... Okay. Wow.

1084
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,508
So where is Jay, anyway?

1085
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,255
Passed out somewhere, wasted.

1086
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,471
I noticed.

1087
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,176
He's done.

1088
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:03,310
New York City. It's exhausting.

1089
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,272
I want this.

1090
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,936
God... looking good naked.

1091
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,647
That's what everyone's after.
I don't care what anyone says.

1092
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,109
You don't need to look good
naked. You've got a brain.

1093
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,778
- Okay...
- And somewhat of a personality.

1094
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,282
I bet you say
that to all the older men

1095
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,326
you try to have your way with.

1096
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,746
I want to be remembered for
more than looks and a body.

1097
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,748
High hopes indeed.

1098
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,750
See?
Now you're ridiculing me again.

1099
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,919
- Again? No.
- Yes. It's okay.

1100
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,409
- I'm sorry. I... I...
- You can't help it.

1101
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,557
Sarcasm. It's in your veins.

1102
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,722
Oof. So smart.

1103
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,273
\"Our brains will
always betray us.\"

1104
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,061
William says that all the time.

1105
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,360
He's right.

1106
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,149
You know, it used to be
that I would think something,

1107
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,817
and then at the same time,
I would think,

1108
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,569
\"Jesus Christ, James,
that's not right.

1109
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,696
Stop thinking that.\"
And then I would, you know,

1110
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,281
stop thinking that.

1111
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,866
But now, you know...
I mean, lately?

1112
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,701
More and more...

1113
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,371
No, I just... lately, I just
hear these... these thoughts.

1114
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,999
I hear... I hear these words
just flying, just spewing,

1115
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,544
just, like, you know,
projectile vomiting

1116
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,420
out of my mouth,
and I'm just like,

1117
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,922
where the hell
did that come from?

1118
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,924
Like, where did you learn
all this garbage?

1119
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,636
Like, \"Stop talking, James.
Stop talking. Mayday, mayday.

1120
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,698
Stop talking. Everybody is
gonna think you're nuts.\"

1121
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,101
But you know?
They're right. I am nuts.

1122
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,103
- No, you're not.
- No, I am.

1123
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:38,357
I am absolutely nuts.
I am that crazy-haired gay guy

1124
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,825
with irreversible sun damage
who says nutty things.

1125
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,281
- You don't say nutty things.
- No, I... please, honey.

1126
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,199
I'm like fucking
Richard Simmons.

1127
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,583
Legendary.

1128
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,212
- Right?
- Okay, I mean, yeah.

1129
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,131
I mean, you know,
the body goes. We know that.

1130
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,716
We can... You know,
we can see that.

1131
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,921
But it's, like,
you know, what they...

1132
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:11,146
What they don't tell you
is how the mind

1133
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,275
slowly starts to slip away.

1134
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,272
Just day by day,

1135
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,066
cell by cell, it just

1136
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,985
your brain, it just

1137
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,161
gets pissed away, you know?

1138
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,284
I mean, not the one that,
you know,

1139
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:34,538
drives a car, or, you know,
writes a play, or watches porn.

1140
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,915
No, no, I'm talking about the

1141
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,968
the brain that fires up
the graveyard shift.

1142
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,900
The one that wakes you up
in the middle of the night.

1143
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,185
The one that

1144
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,688
works overtime.

1145
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,520
The one that loses the reality
of the reality, in the reality.

1146
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,821
Pragmatikotita.

1147
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,160
All that anger.

1148
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,959
And then, one day...

1149
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,083
...\"So we beat on,

1150
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,377
boats against the current,

1151
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,587
borne back ceaselessly
into the past.\"

1152
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,846
I love that book.

1153
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,928
I'm gonna get another beer.
Do you want one?

1154
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,118
Sure.

1155
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,599
Yes, yes, yes!

1156
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,769
I could get so used to
this setup right here.

1157
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,605
Fuck Fire Island.
I want to be as far away

1158
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,864
from the beautiful people
as possible.

1159
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:49,786
Run away somewhere tomorrow,
like up here, like you!

1160
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,158
By myself.

1161
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:56,001
Drinking a beer, smoking a bowl.

1162
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,755
Every night, all summer long.

1163
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:07,548
Doing nothing whatsoever but
writing plays all day, and

1164
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:12,476
searching for fireflies
and nightingales at night.

1165
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,021
Right?

1166
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,485
What's up, man?

1167
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,107
- No, what's going on?
- Nothing.

1168
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,824
What happened?

1169
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,828
Whoa. James, you okay?

1170
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,795
Hey, it's okay.

1171
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,174
It's all good, man.

1172
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,761
Shh. It's all good.

1173
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,738
Happy Sunday, everybody.

1174
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:16,164
I wish I had better news, but...

1175
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,245
Julie Beth just texted me.

1176
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,082
She said that Running was to
be released from prison today.

1177
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,294
The fascist pigs
are holding Running

1178
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,255
and several other
council members

1179
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,718
pending further investigation
of, quote-unquote,

1180
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:38,805
\ "suspicious tribal activity.\"

1181
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:43,894
Frustrating for me, of course,
because I'm still in paradise.

1182
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:46,563
\ "I'm still in paradise.\"

1183
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:50,692
Recharging this old soul.

1184
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,236
Ha!

1185
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,203
How about a little tour?

1186
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,623
What?

1187
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,580
Hello? Hello!

1188
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,543
Anybody here?
Is the coast clear?

1189
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,586
Hello? I'm hearing myself.

1190
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,088
Hello?

1191
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,507
Anyhow, Big Bluffers,

1192
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,933
feast your eyes on paradise.

1193
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,891
Don't you just want to
nest in the trees

1194
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,310
and eat all the flowers?

1195
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,564
Don't do it, Running Water!
They're doused in Deer Out.

1196
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,232
- You're naked!
- What the fuck?

1197
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,859
Joe! You've been there
the whole time?

1198
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,486
It's Jay, okay? Jay? Jay Mulch.

1199
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,988
Like the fertilizer.

1200
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,531
Groundcover, asshat.

1201
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,576
Listen, guys, I've got to go.

1202
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,412
Remember, we are the Big Bluff.

1203
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:47,207
Vegan forever.
Namaste. Mwah. Peace.

1204
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,502
# blessed! #setlife.

1205
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,920
Shut up.

1206
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,505
- Where is he?
- Who?

1207
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,340
Jesus Christ, woman!

1208
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,261
Magic Hands. Lives in a speedo,
smells like Hawaii.

1209
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,929
You're a frickin'
piece of work, dude.

1210
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,223
- Who isn't?
- Not me. I'm normal.

1211
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,850
Excruciatingly so.

1212
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,018
That is true, actually. You are.

1213
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,269
- Was he with you?
- When?

1214
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,354
- Last night.
- Where?

1215
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,065
- At Dunkin Donuts!
- He gave me a massage,

1216
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,192
then he went for
a midnight kayak.

1217
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,987
Midnight kayak.
Drunk and high. Charming.

1218
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,906
- Smile, guys...
- No, I don't...

1219
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,827
No! You did that on purpose,
you idiot!

1220
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,038
- It was an accident!
- An accident!

1221
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,581
How do you work that out?

1222
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,166
I didn't want my picture taken.

1223
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,834
That feels significant.

1224
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,420
So you threw my phone
into the fucking fountain.

1225
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,088
You weren't
holding it tight enough.

1226
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,134
Ha! That's my only
lifeline to Running Water.

1227
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,386
- How ironic.
- Shit.

1228
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,389
I hope I stored
all my shit in the clouds.

1229
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,475
- God, I hope so too.
- You know,

1230
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,144
your shit isn't actually
stored in actual clouds.

1231
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,356
- It isn't!
- Don't ruin it for her.

1232
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,857
Where's the rice?

1233
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,276
It's in the cupboard
next to the fridge.

1234
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,195
It might be organic.

1235
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,115
Nothing in here is organic!

1236
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,285
She's a goddamn delight.

1237
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,704
- Where are you going?
- To find Callisto!

1238
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,309
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, you're naked.

1239
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,483
What?

1240
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,263
I forgot my unicorn.

1241
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,885
Does this even work?

1242
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,721
Nope.
Once it's soaked, it's done.

1243
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,724
- It's over. Bye-bye.
- Shit.

1244
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,395
I really hope I stored
all my shit in the clouds.

1245
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,189
Well,
hope springs eternal, Lady A...

1246
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:38,235
God, yes, that whole
thing with Jacob, Jeremy,

1247
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,696
Judith,
whatever the fuck his name is.

1248
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:42,739
And I've been nice
to him all this time

1249
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,449
because I thought
he was your friend.

1250
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,583
You've been a real doll.
Thank you.

1251
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,630
Did you have sex?

1252
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,590
You and the boyfriend?

1253
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,718
I never kiss and tell,
Aunt Eller.

1254
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,594
Well, it's just so interesting

1255
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,765
why you boys insist on
objectifying each other.

1256
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,227
- 'Cause we like it.
- That's bad.

1257
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,229
- Is it?
- I mean, in terms of

1258
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,940
every spiritual teaching
I've ever read, yes.

1259
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,735
I didn't realize butt-fucking

1260
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,369
was covered in
a course in miracles.

1261
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,076
Is everything a joke, James?

1262
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,835
In this conversation?

1263
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,755
You drink too much.
Clouds your judgment.

1264
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:42,924
- Judgment of what?
- Reality.

1265
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,552
Actress, heal thyself.

1266
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,138
- I do the work.
- What work?

1267
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,974
- The work on myself.
- Really?

1268
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,936
Is that the secret sauce to
becoming a special person?

1269
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,613
An enlightened being?
A chosen one?

1270
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,736
An 11:11?

1271
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,031
Shamelessly demanding that
the world cater to each and

1272
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:09,326
every one of your ridiculous
food and beverage whims?

1273
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,786
That work?

1274
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,288
Not whims. Priorities.

1275
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,831
Whose priorities?

1276
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,000
The universe's, maybe.

1277
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,669
You know, I hate to tell
you something, sweetheart,

1278
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,255
okay, but the universe?

1279
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,758
Girlfriend don't care if
you eat your own offspring.

1280
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,343
Well, I disagree.

1281
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,761
Well,
we'll never know now, will we?

1282
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,679
- Some of us do.
- Do we, now?

1283
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,640
Well, if you did
the work, you'd understand.

1284
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:35,393
Understand what? Some mythical
pile of piping hot rat crap?

1285
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,562
- Stop attacking me.
- I don't attack you!

1286
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,482
Yes, you do.
You always attack me.

1287
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,901
I mean,
even in your fucking play,

1288
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:46,363
you've turned me into ashes!
I am fucking dust.

1289
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,115
Get back in your urn.

1290
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:51,576
And what the hell is that
and where are they going?

1291
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,745
My God. Callisto.

1292
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,211
Jesus.

1293
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,901
You want one?

1294
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,419
What?

1295
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,240
Do you want one?

1296
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,861
A drink?

1297
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,696
No, a hot air balloon ride.

1298
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,199
- I'm good.
- Table for one.

1299
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,291
Merci, monsieur.

1300
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,588
Why isn't he coming in?

1301
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,055
Should we go get him?

1302
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,469
He told me he's never
been inside a hospital.

1303
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,596
I mean, how is that possible?

1304
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,286
I was born in that hospital.

1305
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,559
Who is Jay calling?

1306
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,020
His in-laws. They love him.

1307
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,739
- Why?
- His... skill sets?

1308
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,196
- Did the police call them?
- Police?

1309
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,739
There'll be
an investigation, right?

1310
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,157
My God, I hope not.

1311
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,493
- What do you mean?
- Jesus Christ.

1312
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,244
Maybe you should call Will.

1313
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,121
- Why?
- I don't know.

1314
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,669
He's always so good at
situations like this.

1315
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,760
He... has had a lot of practice.

1316
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,642
My gran committed suicide young.

1317
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:18,980
Well... in her mid-50s.

1318
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,061
Dad said the fairies took her

1319
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:26,738
because she was
too beautiful for this world.

1320
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:29,901
Where did they take her?

1321
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,910
Jury's still out.

1322
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,994
It's terrible being discontent.

1323
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,912
Yeah.

1324
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:44,416
You're always so...
misinterpreted.

1325
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,085
Ha. All the time.

1326
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,011
By everyone, everywhere.

1327
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,098
So fucking exhausting.

1328
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,052
Well

1329
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,312
more for anyone around you,
I suppose, than yourself.

1330
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,684
And

1331
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,853
you can't... won't...

1332
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:08,273
Settle for any one thing or

1333
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,865
personal feeling.

1334
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:16,072
And so you roam about the world

1335
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:20,083
from this beautiful
moment or place

1336
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,712
to the next
beautiful moment or place.

1337
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,927
But it always comes back to you.

1338
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,682
In your flat.

1339
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,311
Alone.

1340
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,734
Making baked beans on toast.

1341
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,985
That's fucking weird.

1342
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,904
- I didn't mean to say...
- Don't start.

1343
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,912
- Drink?
- No!

1344
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,207
- Charlotte?
- No!

1345
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,370
How is Callisto?

1346
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,331
He'll live.

1347
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,583
He's lucky to have you.

1348
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,752
- He'll be fine.
- He always is.

1349
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,796
You know, you guys
can stay here a few extra days

1350
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,772
while he recuperates,
if you want.

1351
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,926
- Are you fucking high?
- Yeah, I guess.

1352
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,677
- A little, yeah.
- James! James!

1353
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,137
We would've stayed
at the fucking hospital

1354
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,889
if our shit wasn't here.

1355
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,141
His parents are driving up
from Greenwich to get us.

1356
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,559
God.

1357
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,894
I told Callisto
to wait in the car.

1358
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,771
- Is that wise?
- Why?

1359
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,147
What...

1360
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,607
You two want
another crack at him?

1361
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,734
- Hey, we're all adults here.
- Are we?

1362
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,510
Look, I'm going to the car
and keep him company.

1363
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,575
You drink too much.

1364
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,127
This from
the coloring book critic. Ha.

1365
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,374
If only your play
was a tenth as witty.

1366
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,959
You've got it all figured out,
don't you?

1367
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,044
I certainly have you
figured out.

1368
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,587
Who doesn't?

1369
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,422
At least the booze
and the bitterness.

1370
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,217
The booze and the bitterness!

1371
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,094
Quelle poetry.

1372
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,596
- Use it in your play.
- I will.

1373
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,473
Hadrian can woo Antinous with it

1374
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,183
over cocktails at the Colosseum.

1375
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,935
If I use it,
I'll send you royalties.

1376
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,770
- As if.
- You know, listen,

1377
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,857
nothing happened between
Callisto and me, okay? Nothing.

1378
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,740
Wait. You think...

1379
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,445
He was drunk, you fool.

1380
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,823
It was more than that.

1381
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,784
James, look. Don't take this
the wrong way...

1382
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,078
Callisto's a fuck-up, okay?

1383
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,164
A beautiful fuck-up, yes.

1384
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:32,667
A... a very sexy, very charming,

1385
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:36,546
very flexible,
very fabulous disaster.

1386
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,263
He fucks things up.

1387
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,266
He's my hero.

1388
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,512
Come what may, I love him.

1389
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,890
And he loves me. Truly, deeply.

1390
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,225
We don't have to
fetishize each other

1391
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,811
into some porn cartoon fantasy.

1392
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,647
We can just be
two men, together.

1393
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,149
We can get married.

1394
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,901
We can have kids,
just like everybody else,

1395
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,611
much to your horror and dismay.

1396
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,578
Shame those asshole babies
never live.

1397
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,585
When did you become so barren?

1398
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,589
\ "Barren\"?

1399
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,384
Your world is barren.

1400
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,465
Your play

1401
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,473
is barren.

1402
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,562
Well.

1403
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,701
You have nothing
to bring into this world.

1404
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,155
Nothing to birth.

1405
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,950
Nothing to bring.

1406
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,163
You are barren.

1407
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:47,825
And I pity you.

1408
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,911
Don't pity me.

1409
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,294
Can't help it.

1410
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,090
You are our worst fear.

1411
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,269
What did I miss?

1412
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,770
Nothing.

1413
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,481
We were just, chatting.

1414
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:22,110
Maybe I should think
about what I'm doing.

1415
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,820
Yeah, you should.

1416
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,615
I'd like to stay, but...

1417
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,702
A free trip to New York

1418
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,704
is very tempting.
Where's my fucking bag?

1419
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:36,255
- Yeah, it really is.
- I could see Heidi.

1420
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,628
I mean, she could do with
my support, poor thing.

1421
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,841
And my asshole agent talked
about taking me out to lunch.

1422
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:49,387
And I could finally
see Wendy's play thing.

1423
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:52,682
- Is it still on?
- Yeah, it's about to close.

1424
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,976
Shit. I can't miss it, then.

1425
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,811
I mean,
I'd never hear the end of it.

1426
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,063
Yeah. She has such mommy issues.

1427
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,940
I could meet with Peter Shine

1428
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,026
at New Horizons about your play.

1429
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,986
- Talk you up.
- Yeah.

1430
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,155
I mean, I know you guys
don't like each other,

1431
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,116
- but I could talk up the play.
- I like him.

1432
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,459
You are ready to have
people read it, right?

1433
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,581
You decide.

1434
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:19,250
Well, I mean... I don't know.

1435
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,669
What can you lose?
If he likes it, he likes it.

1436
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,672
If he doesn't, well,
no biggie, right?

1437
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:29,267
- Right.
- So, that's my plan. I think.

1438
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,097
- Sounds good.
- Okay if I take this?

1439
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,141
I could give it to Peter,
say it's from you.

1440
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,310
- A peace offering.
- I hate wine.

1441
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,146
- Now you're mad.
- I'm not mad.

1442
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,689
I know how you get.

1443
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,483
No. Charlotte,
why are we friends?

1444
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,569
Well... because we

1445
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,446
- we love each other.
- No, I mean...

1446
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,366
I know we love each other,
but I mean...

1447
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,332
Why are we friends?

1448
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:01,966
Why are we friends?

1449
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,930
You!

1450
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,808
You!

1451
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,521
I need to get packed.

1452
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,485
[Footsteps receding]

1453
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,417
Hey.

1454
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,672
How you feeling?

1455
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,476
Like... an idiot.

1456
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:56,973
Where's Jay?

1457
01:11:57,063 --> 01:12:00,476
He's upstairs, packing.

1458
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,318
Your folks are coming.

1459
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,023
I ruined your weekend.

1460
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:09,951
No. You did not ruin my weekend.

1461
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,745
Still time.

1462
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,329
I should've stayed here with
you instead of screwing around

1463
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,498
in the middle of the night
in a kayak on the ocean.

1464
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,293
No, adventure called you away.

1465
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:26,759
I get that.

1466
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,929
- You do?
- Yeah.

1467
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,517
You wanna follow me?

1468
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,270
Where?

1469
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:40,982
Give me your phone.

1470
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,985
Yeah. One sec.

1471
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,442
- It's locked.
- Um,

1472
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:54,238
it's 1... 19.1963.

1473
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,247
It's William's birthday.

1474
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,249
There. Now you're following me.

1475
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:07,251
Wow, that's quite
the picture there.

1476
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,629
- Keep scrolling.
- Jesus Christ!

1477
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,381
Let me see.
Yeah, that one's lit, I know.

1478
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,509
Yeah, it's \ "lit, \" indeed.

1479
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,476
- I gotta push the envelope.
- Pushed.

1480
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:21,224
- What about this one?
- What's...

1481
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,351
Wait, is that a salad
between your legs?

1482
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:26,604
- Yes.
- . Well, it looks good.

1483
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,815
It's delicious. Huge portions.

1484
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,358
Great value. You should try one.

1485
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,360
- I feel like I just did!
- Don't make fun.

1486
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,529
- I'm not! I...
- It's how I support myself.

1487
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,079
Yeah, I know, honey. It's great.

1488
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,826
Got to shake it
'til you make it, right?

1489
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,495
Well, never worked for me.

1490
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,997
Of course, we were still
using two tin cups and a string

1491
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,259
when that opportunity
presented itself.

1492
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,386
Who's this?

1493
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,091
- That's me.
- Aww!

1494
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,343
Awkward teenager.
I hate that picture.

1495
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,761
Why?

1496
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,264
I wasn't working out then.

1497
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,100
- Who's that with you?
- Prom date.

1498
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,643
Your girlfriend?

1499
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,395
Sister. Artemis.

1500
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,188
You took your sister
to the prom?

1501
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,983
She took me.
It's a whole Greek thing.

1502
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:14,819
Well,
we all have our awkward phases.

1503
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,578
Mine ended last year.

1504
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,278
They're here.
They're in the driveway.

1505
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,467
Boy, they look pissed.

1506
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,177
Charlotte's coming with us.

1507
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,978
It just made more sense.

1508
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,142
Callisto. Let's go.

1509
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,858
I'm not leaving.

1510
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,362
You're not leaving?

1511
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,567
Charlotte, will you please go

1512
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,319
tell Callisto's mother
to come inside?

1513
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,279
No!

1514
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,989
No?

1515
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,200
Would you like me to go
and tell Zeus and Hera

1516
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,913
that you've decided to live
here for the rest of your life?

1517
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,874
That you found yourself in the
arms of a middle-aged man

1518
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:12,008
and can't let go?

1519
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,260
Well...
thanks for a fun weekend.

1520
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,935
It was really fun.

1521
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,786
Let's do it again real soon.

1522
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:28,863
We'll be in the car, Callisto.

1523
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,945
I'll call you again, darling.

1524
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,290
Honey, you gotta
get in that car.

1525
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:54,341
Have you not observed how
I've given death much thought?

1526
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,673
Since I first observed you,

half in a dream.

What do you suppose
I saw in that half-dream?

1531
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,402
Youth, and beauty.

1532

And the inglorious
but safe ending

who accept its slow
