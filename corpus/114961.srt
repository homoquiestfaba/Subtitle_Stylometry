1
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,150
46-99402.

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,198
Transfer to 53-01138.

3
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,037
What'd we just do?

4
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,457
The Republican Party just made
a donation to the Black Panthers.

5
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,127
- Farm out.
- Right arm.

6
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,547
- Who's next?
- Let's see.

7
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,050
Richard Nixon's personal checking account
is in here.

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,052
This is a challenge.

9
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,806
Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

10
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:23,477
How about the National Association
to Legalize Marijuana?

11
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,479
Perfect. How much should he give?

12
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,525
He's a generous man. I'd say,
all he's got. God, I'm hungry!

13
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,610
Marty...

14
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,613
...you're sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

15
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:39,243
Cosmo, trust me.

16
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,252
Posit: The phone company
has too much money.

17
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,588
- Good one.
- Consequence?

18
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,089
They're corrupt. Result?

19
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,509
The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

20
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,763
- Conclusion?
- Ma Bell needs to donate some money.

21
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,849
We're gonna change the world.

22
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,187
I just wish we could get course credit
for this. Gosh!

23
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,982
You gotta eat. You want some food?

24
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,152
Loser goes.

25
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,363
I never lose.

26
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,829
Pepperoni pizza, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

27
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,793
- Power to the people, Cos.
- Power to the people, Marty.

28
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:34,965
One cannot trust anybody these days.

29
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,257
No, don't do this.

30
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,174
Marty! Marty!

31
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,443
Martin.

32
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,071
Martin.

33
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,833
It's time.

34
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,461
How're we doing?

35
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,632
Carl's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cable vault.

36
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,886
Whistler is reading.

37
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,894
We're up.

38
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,562
What's with the lobby?

39
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,482
Still just the one guard.

40
00:05:56,732 --> 00:06:01,362
Okay, Mother,
try the ones coming off the blue trunk.

41
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,742
Nope.

42
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:11,956
Try the ones coming off the white trunk.
These don't sound right.

43
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,043
<i>Hold on.</i>

44
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,921
We even have photos
of the guy leaving the embassy...

45
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,423
...through the back service entrance.

46
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:25,177
Hey, Crease, you on?

47
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,512
Yeah, I'm on.

48
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,974
<i>Were you still in the CIA in '72?</i>

49
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,225
Yeah, why?

50
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,435
Did you know the Deputy
Director of Planning...

51
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:37,731
...was in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

52
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:41,360
What are you saying?
The CIA caused the Managua earthquake?

53
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,573
I can't prove it, but...

54
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,410
I can't talk to that guy.

55
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,706
Hold on, Mother. Go back one.

56
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,541
Bingo!

57
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,712
Securing bridge clips.

58
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,799
Preparing to sever master alarm circuit.

59
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,302
Five, four...

60
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,389
<i>I looked in that box just now.</i>

61
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,101
<i>There wasn't anything there.</i>

62
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,809
Nice bank?

63
00:07:55,059 --> 00:08:00,231
You wouldn't believe what I had to do
to get a safe deposit box.

64
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:35,683
Shit. We're gettin' too old for this.

65
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,563
<i>- Westguard Security.
- Yeah, I got a fire at Centurion Bank.</i>

66
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:45,943
<i>We got the alarm. Are there any
secondary indications? Smoke or flame?</i>

67
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,236
No.

68
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,865
<i>Probably a false alarm. We've been
getting them in your area all night.</i>

69
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:55,411
<i>- See if it resets.
- Man, I don't know.</i>

70
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:09,258
- Sure you know which one to cut?
- Yes! The alarm's always the green one.

71
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,218
Good, Carl.

72
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:15,931
I'm not waitin' any longer.
I'm callin' the fire...

73
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,228
It stopped. Sorry.

74
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:25,941
<i>- No problem. And, son?
- Sir?</i>

75
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,987
<i>- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

76
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,450
All yours, Bish.

77
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:47,755
So, how much do you want?

78
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,884
$80,000, $90,000, $100,000.

79
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,427
Okay.

80
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,889
May I ask why you're closing
your account with us today, sir?

81
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:03,229
I just had this weird feeling
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

82
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:25,334
Gentlemen, your communication lines
are vulnerable.

83
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,419
Fire exits need to be monitored.

84
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,005
Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained.

85
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,383
Outside of that,
everything seems to be fine.

86
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:38,264
You'll get our full report in a few days.
But first, who's got my check?

87
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:42,351
So, people hire you
to break into their places...

88
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:47,731
...to make sure no one
can break into their places?

89
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,734
It's a living.

90
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,238
Not a very good one.

91
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,658
Thank you.

92
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,081
Is that him?

93
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,460
Yeah, that's him.

94
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,800
Who's got the report for the bank sneak?

95
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,636
- I'm gonna type it up later.
- You are?

96
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,931
We haven't paid the typist since January,
so it's me or Whistler.

97
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,893
- Better Whistler.
- We've got customers.

98
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:27,771
- Shoes?
- Expensive.

99
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,275
Look busy, guys.

100
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,153
- Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
- Hi.

101
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,155
- Buddy Wallace.
- Hi.

102
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,533
- We've heard great things about you.
- They're all true.

103
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,701
Thanks, Carl.

104
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,748
Let's go to the conference room.
You can tell us how we can help.

105
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,922
- Okay.
- Thank you.

106
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,259
- So here...
- Before we begin...

107
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,012
...there's something we'd like to clear up.

108
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:04,225
Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

109
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,185
But your team...

110
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:10,606
- I know, kind of different.
- Yes, you are.

111
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:19,448
Darren Roskow, also known as "Mother".

112
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,284
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

113
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:27,206
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

114
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,750
Carl Arbogast, age 19.

115
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,505
Caught breaking into the Oakland School
District computer to change his grades.

116
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,049
I know. We're the ones who caught him.

117
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,344
Irwin Emery, also known as "Whistler".

118
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,722
He had some little problem
with the phone company.

119
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,016
Sixty-two counts?

120
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,810
You want law enforcement?

121
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,980
How about Donald Crease?
Twenty-two year veteran of the CIA.

122
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,818
Terminated, 1987. Why was that?

123
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,946
I don't know. I think a personality conflict.
Who are you?

124
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,240
Relax, Marty.
We have to check these things.

125
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,660
Everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

126
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,289
And then there's Martin Bishop.

127
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,378
He doesn't seem to have a past.

128
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,841
Sorry to waste your time.
I don't work for the government.

129
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,677
We know.

130
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,265
National Security Agency.

131
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,935
You're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

132
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,812
No, that's the FBI.

133
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,190
We're not chartered
for domestic surveillance.

134
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,444
I see. You just overthrow governments,
set up friendly dictators.

135
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,154
No, that's the CIA.

136
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:44,033
We protect government communications,
try to break the other fellow's codes.

137
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,576
We're the good guys, Marty.

138
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,038
I can't tell you what a relief that is, Dick.

139
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:52,041
All right, that's enough.

140
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,876
Let's go.

141
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,463
If you change your mind...

142
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,175
...call us at this number...

143
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,136
...Mr. Brice.

144
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:42,424
Help me out?

145
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,052
Spare a quarter? Help me out.

146
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,471
The government's taken away my home.

147
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,267
Talk to him.

148
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:01,193
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

149
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:06,782
I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

150
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,703
We're all friends here, right? Easy, easy.

151
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,707
- Want some coffee or something?
- No.

152
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,794
- Buddy, is that Janek's file?
- Yeah, Janek's file.

153
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,255
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

154
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,757
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

155
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:27,178
Specializes in large-number theory,
prime numbers, factoring.

156
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,971
- Cryptography.
- Very good.

157
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,266
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

158
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,351
Way out of profile for a guy like that.

159
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:38,481
It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

160
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,858
- I know you're not gonna say Russia.
- Yeah.

161
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,485
Give me a break.

162
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,279
We won, they lost.
It's been in a couple of papers.

163
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,656
We still spy on them. They still spy on us.

164
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,992
We intercepted a fax last week. Here.

165
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,496
He's making some kind of box,
a little black box.

166
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:57,500
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

167
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,044
- Security technology...
- Sensor techniques, who knows?

168
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:04,256
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

169
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:08,469
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

170
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,929
No way.

171
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,722
Sorry, Marty.

172
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,434
We don't have a lot of choice here.

173
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,061
- Do it yourself.
- We can't.

174
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,939
By law, we're not allowed
to do this kind of operation.

175
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,107
Then get the FBI.

176
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,193
Yeah, right, the FBI.

177
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:28,030
The FBI can't work for us without approval
from a congressional committee.

178
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,157
- We don't have the time.
- So why me?

179
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,286
- Frankly, because we...
- Yeah, frankly.

180
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,748
Marty, sit down, please.

181
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,293
Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.

182
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:45,256
You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

183
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:49,844
- We know you can keep your mouth shut.
- Job pays $175,000, payable on delivery.

184
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:54,557
You can distribute it among the poor,
if you like.

185
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,809
- Pass.
- We also clean up your record.

186
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,186
Quash the outstanding warrant
for your arrest.

187
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,105
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years.

188
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,357
That was without flight
to evade prosecution.

189
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,695
We all know what happened
to him in there.

190
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,242
If I say no?

191
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,953
Don't say no.

192
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:20,249
What good would you do anybody
in prison?

193
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,628
I don't believe this.
You lied to us all these years.

194
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,006
- Even lied to us about your name.
- Sorry, okay?

195
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:31,844
I'm sorry, but when you're wanted
by the feds, you don't go telling everybody.

196
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,347
We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You tell us.

197
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:40,853
Fine. Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

198
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,649
We all have our little secrets, don't we?

199
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,319
Look, you guys have a decision to make.

200
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,987
This is not a test.

201
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,532
The penetration is live,
the target is unaware.

202
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,620
Sneaking a foreign intelligence service
that might kill us is not what we do.

203
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,749
The probable level of security is very low.

204
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,795
But if you guys don't want to take
that chance just to keep me out of jail...

205
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:08,923
...fine, I understand, don't do it.

206
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:13,219
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other guys,
but I'm in it for the money.

207
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:16,889
- I don't care if you go to jail.
- Me neither. I'm in.

208
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,185
Could we maybe just go back
to the "they might kill us" part?

209
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:25,231
If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

210
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:29,610
It pays $175,000!

211
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,863
I'm in.

212
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,661
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.

213
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,789
All right, what do we need?

214
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,291
We start with a very light surveillance.

215
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:47,086
Level three. First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

216
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,505
He's giving a lecture tomorrow at U.C.

217
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:54,009
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

218
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,094
Let's do it.

219
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,973
For the lecture, you want
to take Whistler or do you want me?

220
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:04,270
No, that's okay, I thought I'd ask Liz.

221
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,105
Who's this?

222
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,525
Sort of an old friend.

223
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:55,488
Practice! Practice, practice!

224
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,161
- Hi.
- We're not getting back together.

225
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,038
- Did I say anything?
- You will.

226
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm here on business, Liz.

227
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,127
Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a club. It's a boy's club.

228
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,172
You have a clubhouse,
you probably have a secret handshake.

229
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,965
Liz, I need your help.

230
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:17,802
I will not be dragged back into your world.

231
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:22,640
I have a new group of gifted children,
and I like the fact they're under 30.

232
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,974
Excuse me.

233
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,186
There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

234
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,854
I've read him. Now go away.

235
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:33,359
- He's giving a master lecture at 3:30...
- How nice for him.

236
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,737
- I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
- I am not going out with you.

237
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:41,075
This isn't a date, dummy.
This is a scientific exploration, a tutorial.

238
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,120
I need you...

239
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:48,290
...to explain it to me.

240
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,378
Read a book.

241
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,548
They found me, Liz.

242
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,634
The government found me.

243
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,220
They offered me a deal.
If I take their offer...

244
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,016
...they clear my record,
and I can get my name back.

245
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,902
You and I are not getting back together.

246
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:20,614
Don't flatter yourself.

247
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:24,118
Pick me up at 3:00.

248
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,204
Yes!

249
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:30,875
While the number-field sieve
is the best method currently known...

250
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:37,465
...there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

251
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:40,968
This guy's good.

252
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:45,848
...over the rationals, and hence
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

253
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:50,519
Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms...

254
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,732
You seeing anybody?

255
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:02,615
This isn't just about large-number theory.
It's about cryptography.

256
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,117
You mean codes?

257
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:09,038
I mean unbreakable codes.

258
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:13,042
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

259
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,752
...and allow us to acquire...

260
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:21,091
...the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner.

261
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:22,551
Are you seeing...

262
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:27,681
Such an approach is purely theoretical.
So far, no one has been able...

263
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:32,102
...to accomplish such constructions...

264
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,647
...yet.

265
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,107
The numbers are so unbelievably big...

266
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:40,194
...all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

267
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,239
But maybe, just maybe...

268
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:47,535
...there's a shortcut.
- I'll bet you anything he's found it.

269
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:51,122
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

270
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:54,458
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools...

271
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,711
...may be able to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

272
00:22:57,962 --> 00:23:00,214
Martin.

273
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,633
Martin, how wonderful to see you.

274
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,052
- Hi, Greg. How are you?
- Is it not fabulous?

275
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:09,390
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

276
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,810
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

277
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,979
At least I...

278
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,690
Goodness, can it be?

279
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,774
Yeah.

280
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:22,027
- Elizabeth!
- She's dying to talk to you too, Greg.

281
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:25,739
Elizabeth.

282
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,328
- Hello, Greg.
- Elizabeth and Martin.

283
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,748
My heart leaps like gazelle
to see you back together again.

284
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,376
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

285
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,629
No? What a pity.

286
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,885
Wait. I have smashing idea. Martin!

287
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:49,221
Kiev String Quartet plays
at the consulate on Thursday night.

288
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:52,641
You will be my guests.

289
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,769
Really, Greg,
I wouldn't know how to repay you.

290
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,565
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

291
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,611
...perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

292
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:08,115
- Gregor, you are shameless.
- See you Thursday night.

293
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,284
What?

294
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,119
New title.

295
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,121
Cultural Attaché.

296
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,790
Unbelievable!

297
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,294
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

298
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,172
I'll bet.

299
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,927
I don't care what anybody says
about the new world order.

300
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,804
I don't trust that guy.

301
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,389
Who, Greg? He's harmless.

302
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,143
Let the number itself tell us.

303
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:41,106
If you'll excuse me...

304
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:46,529
...I have some work.
- You're gonna follow him, aren't you?

305
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,240
It's okay. I'll get a cab.

306
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,493
Can I call you?

307
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:56,205
Just be careful.

308
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,229
Janek just got in the elevator.

309
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,690
- Going up.
- We will be ready for him.

310
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,318
- How's the audio?
- Good. Mother's close.

311
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:29,655
He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

312
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,866
What, no parachute?

313
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:36,579
All right. Entry and lights on.

314
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:39,248
- Describe it.
- Looks like a workroom.

315
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:44,920
A bench with a soldering gun,
two spools of wire and a magnifying lamp.

316
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:48,424
Sounds like he's making somethin'.

317
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,552
Then a desk.

318
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:55,848
Telephone, lamp, answering machine.

319
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:58,267
A jar of pencils, but no little black box.

320
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,187
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

321
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:04,940
He's logging on the computer.

322
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:09,487
This is good.

323
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:14,950
He's gonna type in his password,
and we're gonna get a clear shot.

324
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:26,170
<i>Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.</i>

325
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,007
Let's get an ID on Dr. Rhyzkov.
She was with him this afternoon.

326
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,968
She was trying to tell him something
and it was making him...

327
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:35,513
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

328
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:39,558
<i>Let's do what we did in Mexico City.</i>

329
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:42,144
I didn't know you could do that
in Mexico City.

330
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:44,897
- Mr. Bishop, mind if I take a look?
- Carl.

331
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,983
Grow up.

332
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:54,406
<i>- Let me see.
- Oh, Gunter.</i>

333
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,040
<i>Elena, really!</i>

334
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,711
<i>I must finish my work.</i>

335
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,384
Okay, back to work.

336
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:16,679
Nope, here we go.
Now we're gonna get our password.

337
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,641
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

338
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,601
<i>I'm sorry, really.</i>

339
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:26,981
Get out of the way. She's in the way.

340
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:30,651
<i>- I don't believe this.
- I'm sorry.</i>

341
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,363
<i>It's just, I have this work.</i>

342
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,409
<i>I give you something to work, baby.</i>

343
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,788
<i>Okay. Just for a little while.</i>

344
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,462
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

345
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:53,257
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

346
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,676
<i>Elena, really!</i>

347
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:59,972
<i>I must finish my work.</i>

348
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,976
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

349
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,479
Maybe there's a frame
where she doesn't block it.

350
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:09,231
I'll blow it up.

351
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:12,067
- Gentlemen.
- Who's Rhyzkov?

352
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:16,280
Dr. Elena Rhyzkov,
visiting professor from Czechoslovakia...

353
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,533
...senior research fellow in astrophysics.

354
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:24,914
- Bingo.
- Setec Astronomy, whatever that is.

355
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:29,084
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

356
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,338
<i>- There.
- I'm sorry.</i>

357
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,841
- "W", "G"...
- Looks like the "H".

358
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,718
- Where do you get "H"?
- Next to the "L".

359
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:42,056
- Come on. Do it again.
- "H" isn't next to the "L".

360
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:48,771
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

361
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:56,529
Okay, that's definitely "W", "G".

362
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,240
Definitely not. No, that's a "V".

363
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,783
She's in the way.

364
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:04,578
Fellas, Janek's little black box
is on his desk...

365
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:08,791
...between the pencil jar and the lamp.

366
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:13,504
Whistler, I hate to tell you this,
but you're blind.

367
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,590
Play the tape back again.

368
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:21,679
- But you can't see anything.
- Don't look. Listen.

369
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:24,223
Play it back.

370
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,768
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not...</i>

371
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,521
He's got a service.

372
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:34,817
What's he need an answering machine for?

373
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,738
There's our little black box.

374
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:47,955
Okay, boss.

375
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:52,084
This LTX-71 concealable mike is part
of the same system that NASA used...

376
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,670
...when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

377
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,715
The astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage...

378
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,551
...at Norton Air Force Base,
San Bernardino, California.

379
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:04,555
So it worked for them.
It shouldn't give us too many problems.

380
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,349
Thanks.

381
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,853
- You didn't have a delivery?
- I should have the invoice.

382
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,732
No delivery is scheduled.
They didn't have anything on record.

383
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,026
Did my wife drop a cake off for me?

384
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:19,987
- There's no cake here.
- Party for Marge on the second floor.

385
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:23,532
- She was supposed to drop a cake off.
- I don't know about it.

386
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:25,159
There she is, late as usual.

387
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:30,289
It states here that I am to deliver
36 boxes of Liquid Drano to this address.

388
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,376
I don't care what that says.
You're not on the list, you can't get in.

389
00:30:34,627 --> 00:30:38,464
- I might lose my job.
- That's not my problem. Now beat it.

390
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:40,758
I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this?

391
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,511
- Just buzz it. I can't reach my card.
- Wait one minute.

392
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:48,766
We're late for a party on the second floor.
Push the goddamned buzzer.

393
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,560
Thanks.

394
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:22,007
Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic keypad?

395
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,177
Don't even joke about that.
Those things are impossible.

396
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,222
Think I'm joking?
Looks like they just put it in.

397
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,142
Oh, boy.

398
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:37,731
This might help. An old buddy of mine
who was in Desert Storm sent it to me.

399
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:41,694
'Course, he was on the other side.

400
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:44,613
<i>Come on. There's got to be
a way around these things.</i>

401
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:47,992
All right, all right.

402
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,498
This might work.

403
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:57,960
Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,964
Right.

405
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,057
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

406
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,188
It worked.

407
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,884
Got it.

408
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:52,306
- Gunter? You're not...
- God, no. Here you go. Nice to see you.

409
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:56,227
- Who the hell is that?
- Battle stations.

410
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:59,772
Monitor the audio. Grab the mike.

411
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:00,815
Okay.

412
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,359
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, don't scream.

413
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,403
I promise, nothing will happen to you.

414
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:09,073
Okay?

415
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:17,081
Who are you?

416
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,876
- He's a PI.
- You're a private investigator.

417
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:25,297
- I'm a private investigator.
- But why?

418
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:28,592
Who hired you?

419
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:33,973
- Who hired you?
- Mrs. Janek.

420
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,643
There is not Mrs. Janek.

421
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,230
Yeah?

422
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,275
You got us stumped.

423
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:50,281
Oh, yeah? Who do you think paid
for your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

424
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,620
That was good.

425
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:57,997
Velma Janek.

426
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,917
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings...

427
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:05,463
...vast real estate holdings:
Farms, banks, shopping malls.

428
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,256
Two shopping malls.

429
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:11,760
She supports Gunter but figured he
was cheating. That's why she hired me.

430
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:15,181
Bastard liar!

431
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:18,058
- I'll kill him!
- No, no, no!

432
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:20,686
No, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

433
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:22,605
Get a hold of yourself.

434
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:25,774
You gotta not tell him you know.

435
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,903
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

436
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:31,071
You don't know anything about a wife.

437
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:34,700
You just give me one good reason why.

438
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,120
I'll give you a reason.

439
00:34:39,497 --> 00:34:43,042
Give you a really good reason.

440
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,753
It's just what she'd want you to do.

441
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,713
It's just what she'd want you to do.

442
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:51,717
It's just what she'd want you to do.

443
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,929
I don't understand.

444
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:57,473
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

445
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:01,310
Look, I might lose my license for this...

446
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,897
...but my client is
a vindictive, bitter woman.

447
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:09,693
She's been withholding marital favors
for years and now she's out to ruin him.

448
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:12,154
And she's using you to get to her.

449
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:16,575
And she's using me to get to you.

450
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:20,162
I know that's confusing,
but don't you see what's happening here?

451
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:24,875
You and me,
we're pawns in this ugly little game.

452
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:28,295
- If you love him...
- lf you love him...

453
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:31,549
If you love him...

454
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:36,929
...if you really love him...

455
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,765
...then just keep on loving him.

456
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:45,437
Never let him know that you know what
he thinks you don't know that you know.

457
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:47,439
You know?

458
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,441
And give him head whenever he wants.

459
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:53,154
Give him help.

460
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:58,701
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.

461
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:01,787
Can you do that for Gunter?

462
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:05,666
- Yes, yes, I can. I can.
- Okay, good.

463
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,961
Now get outta here.

464
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,928
Give him head?

465
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:21,223
Be a beacon?

466
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,050
The key meeting took place July 1, 1958.

467
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,136
The Air Force brought this space visitor
to the White House...

468
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:01,138
...for an interview with Eisenhower.

469
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:05,226
Ike said, "Give us technology,
we'll give you all the cow lips you want."

470
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:07,561
Don't listen to this man. He's certifiable.

471
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,730
Your husband knows
about cattle mutilations.

472
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,026
He's ex-CIA. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

473
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,486
Understood, understood.

474
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:18,197
One thing I don't quite get, though...

475
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:23,994
...was you and Cosmo,
you were taking all these big chances...

476
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:26,539
...what for?

477
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:31,460
We were young. And there was a war on.

478
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:36,674
- It was a good way to meet girls.
- I'll bet.

479
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:40,761
How come you didn't get caught?

480
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:46,016
I went out for pizza.

481
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,811
Then I went to Canada.

482
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,355
I was lucky. He wasn't.

483
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:53,858
Did he ever forgive you?

484
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:56,944
I hope so.

485
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,322
He died in prison.

486
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:11,876
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

487
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,545
Don?

488
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,840
We have never been to Europe together.

489
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,427
And we are going.

490
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:25,473
- Madrid, Lisbon.
- Athens and Scotland.

491
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:28,642
- And Tahiti.
- Yes, yes.

492
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:31,812
- Mother?
- Well, you know...

493
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:36,275
...I've never actually had a really cool car
that I could fit comfortably into.

494
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:39,153
So I think I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago...

495
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:45,493
...with a big kitchen, water bed.
Big kitchen.

496
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,828
Carl?

497
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,955
I'd like to have a deep relationship...

498
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:54,960
...with a beautiful woman, who melts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

499
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:58,255
We're not getting paid that much, Carl.

500
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:01,634
Well, you know, someone like Liz.

501
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:06,096
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

502
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,308
Whistler?

503
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,685
Peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

504
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,729
Right on.

505
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:15,523
And women.

506
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:19,026
- All right.
- Hear, hear!

507
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,365
- That's not a word, "scrunchy".
- Yes, it is.

508
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,909
- Scrunchy is not a word.
- Scrunchy is a word.

509
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,078
- Since when?
- Know what happens to your face?

510
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:31,789
- It's not a word.
- Right now your face is scrunchy.

511
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,168
All right. We gotta take it as a word.

512
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:47,346
- I have...
- I didn't invent the word.

513
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,682
- Carl?
- Yes?

514
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,226
What does it say where this is?

515
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,646
Hold on a second here.

516
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:59,775
"System out."

517
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,486
Guys...

518
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,157
...I really think you should
leave that thing alone.

519
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:11,787
Yeah, I know. I just wanted
to see something. Don't worry, Don.

520
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:17,418
- How are they spelling Setec?
- S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

521
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,963
Special extraterrestrial?

522
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:24,550
Earthling counter.

523
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:28,012
Is that right? Two, four, five.

524
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:32,099
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around...

525
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,853
...and looks at me
like right dead in my eye.

526
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,522
- Setec.
- What?

527
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,192
Setec Astronomy.

528
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:45,571
I just love it when a man says that to me.

529
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:49,158
Setec doesn't mean anything.

530
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,537
Excuse me.

531
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,856
Carl...

532
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:27,738
...can you get me some cable
and that l/O interface, please?

533
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:39,166
"Monterey's coast."

534
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:43,587
Does "Monterey's coast"
mean anything to you guys?

535
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,841
- No.
- No.

536
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:52,805
Here, help me with this.

537
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:04,942
Carl, get the diagnostics.

538
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:14,869
How about "my Socrates note"?

539
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:17,872
No.

540
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:34,763
- No, I don't...
- No. No.

541
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,568
Got it. Move to another one.

542
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,456
Give me another one.

543
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:03,501
Stay in that quadrant.

544
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:16,096
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

545
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,768
Mother, what was that? Go back one.

546
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:23,687
All right.

547
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:27,525
Holy cow.

548
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:31,487
What the hell is this?

549
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:49,380
"Too many secrets."

550
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:56,929
Bish, I think you better come over here.

551
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,807
- Carl, got your black book?
- Yes.

552
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:04,728
Give me the number
for something impossible to access.

553
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,439
Okay. What about this?

554
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,942
Federal Reserve Transfer Node,
Culpepper, Virginia.

555
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:13,279
- Yeah, sure. Good luck.
- 900 billion a day go through there.

556
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:15,865
That'll do. Punch it in.

557
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:20,077
Okay. We won't get in.

558
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,456
It's encrypted.

559
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:30,087
See?

560
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,674
Mother, that last contact.

561
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:45,394
Look at this, boys.

562
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,774
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

563
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,942
- Don't screw around with that thing!
- Wait.

564
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:57,281
- Carl, what else you got?
- National power grid?

565
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:00,868
Okay.

566
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:08,167
Here we come. Hey, Mother.

567
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:11,420
Probing.

568
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:17,468
Unbelievable.

569
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:23,474
Anybody want to black out New England?
Carl, what else?

570
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,936
Air traffic control system.

571
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:37,780
Okay, Mother.

572
00:45:42,118 --> 00:45:45,121
Oh, my God.

573
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:46,705
How is this possible?

574
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:49,834
Cryptography systems are based
on mathematical problems...

575
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:53,129
...so complex they cannot be solved
without a key.

576
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,674
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key...

577
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:00,678
...and he hard-wired it into that chip.
- Turn it off.

578
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:04,598
- Want to crash some passenger jets?
- I said turn it off.

579
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,560
Turn it off.

580
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:19,238
So it's a code-breaker.

581
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:25,453
No, it's the code-breaker.

582
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:29,832
No more secrets.

583
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:34,753
Honey, you and Melissa get your things.

584
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:42,511
- Night-night.
- Good night.

585
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,435
What time is the hand-off?

586
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:52,521
9:00 a.m.

587
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:58,986
Well, between now and then, we are going
to institute some security around here.

588
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,156
This is where I get off.

589
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,743
Nice to see you again. I'm out of here.

590
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:09,163
Don't take this personally, Liz...

591
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,541
...but you were the only one
who knew Martin's secret.

592
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:15,336
Somebody talked.

593
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:19,799
So make yourself comfortable.
We're all staying right here tonight.

594
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:21,509
No.

595
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:25,221
I'm getting my bag, and I'm leaving.

596
00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:28,766
So relax, Crease.

597
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:35,606
I'll relax when we get that damn thing
out of here. Until then, you stay.

598
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:41,112
What?

599
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:47,243
There isn't a government on this planet
that wouldn't kill us all for that thing.

600
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:59,755
- Sorry.
- I see.

601
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,841
Carl, would you get the alarm?

602
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:04,593
- Mother, lock everything down.
- Unplug that thing.

603
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:06,303
- Kill the lights.
- You bet.

604
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:10,141
Thank you for the trust, fellas.

605
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:53,601
I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

606
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:57,188
- Bye, Liz.
- You too, Liz.

607
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:10,659
I hope the hand-off goes well.

608
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:16,957
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

609
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:25,674
Martin? Time.

610
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:31,388
Yeah.

611
00:50:08,968 --> 00:50:12,429
Morning. Any problems?

612
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,266
- Nope.
- Want a cappuccino?

613
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:17,977
No.

614
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,917
Got his check?

615
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,174
Hey, Martin!

616
00:50:48,424 --> 00:50:52,428
- Telephone!
- Just a minute.

617
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:56,307
It's your mother.

618
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:14,533
She's old. Excuse me.

619
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,839
- Get in the car.
- What?

620
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,884
Get in the car.

621
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,678
I didn't get the money.

622
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:37,723
Now!

623
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:42,686
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

624
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:45,898
Janek's dead.

625
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:47,900
They killed him.

626
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,986
The NSA doesn't kill people, Martin.
Who are they?

627
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:54,865
You said there isn't a government
on earth that wouldn't kill for that thing.

628
00:51:55,116 --> 00:51:57,910
Not ours. Who were those guys?

629
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,539
There's one way to find out.

630
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:25,396
They took away my home. Help me out?

631
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:29,733
The government took away my home.

632
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,612
My God.

633
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,327
Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

634
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:43,539
And don't tell me you won't do it
because I've got to have it.

635
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:45,875
I need to know, and I need to know now.

636
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:49,628
Guys, that federal building's been
scheduled for demolition since August.

637
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:52,756
Housed the Federal Trade Commission,
and Dept. Of Agriculture.

638
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,008
Been vacant for a month.

639
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,427
The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

640
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:59,096
Their West Coast operations are out
of Los Angeles.

641
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:02,892
Oh, God. Yeah, thanks.

642
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:06,520
Janek's grant is from the NSA.

643
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:10,232
How could you be so goddamn stupid?

644
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:13,569
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

645
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:17,531
They probably were government...

646
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:21,786
...just not ours.

647
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,919
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

648
00:53:30,044 --> 00:53:35,049
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to a concert.

649
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,325
Keep smiling.

650
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:06,956
- Martin, have you lost your mind?
- Excuse yourself.

651
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:12,169
Darling, would you excuse me
for a moment?

652
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,104
- Give me back Janek's box, Greg.
- Martin, I don't have it.

653
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,649
- Now you must believe me.
- No.

654
00:54:33,899 --> 00:54:36,402
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

655
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,196
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

656
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:41,740
Not for lack of trying, mind you.

657
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:44,243
Your codes are entirely different from ours.

658
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:49,623
We never had any luck in breaking them
so Lord knows, I wanted that box...

659
00:54:49,874 --> 00:54:53,210
...but we did not take it.

660
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:00,050
Then who did?

661
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,972
What I will tell you now,
I cannot tell you in this building.

662
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:08,267
Do you understand?

663
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,437
Come.

664
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:17,193
Martin.

665
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:21,238
You must trust me.

666
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:32,333
- Him?
- No.

667
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,961
- Him?
- No.

668
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:42,593
- Him?
- No.

669
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,721
I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

670
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:47,765
You still keep tabs on all our agents.

671
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,226
These are just the ones
we thought we could turn.

672
00:55:50,476 --> 00:55:55,022
You know, sexual problems,
financial troubles.

673
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:58,859
Then we had financial troubles.

674
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:02,613
That's him. The older guy.

675
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:07,243
A loathsome man named Buddy Devries,
a.k.a. Buddy Weber...

676
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:10,955
...Buddy Wallace.
- Wallace. That's him.

677
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:14,416
We tried to recruit him in '83.

678
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:17,837
Drinking problem, married three times.

679
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:21,715
Left the NSA four years ago.

680
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:24,426
Oh, my.

681
00:56:24,677 --> 00:56:27,471
What?

682
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,559
What?

683
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:38,065
You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

684
00:56:38,274 --> 00:56:42,736
Why? Who's he workin' for?

685
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:49,702
Your FBI is such a pain in the ass.

686
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:56,000
Who's he workin' for?

687
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,004
Martin, I can offer you
asylum inside this car.

688
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:03,632
Technically, it's part of the consulate.
Do you wish our protection?

689
00:57:03,883 --> 00:57:08,345
What? Who is Wallace working for?

690
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:14,226
Mr. Bishop? My name is
Special Agent Bestrop, FBI.

691
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:17,480
Please, step out of the vehicle.

692
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,608
- Do you wish our protection?
- Mr. Bishop...

693
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:24,403
...get out of the vehicle now.

694
00:57:29,158 --> 00:57:33,245
You won't know who to trust.

695
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:42,588
Mr. Bishop, step over here, please.
Hands on the wall, sir.

696
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:54,850
Is this loaded?

697
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,770
Yes.

698
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,213
Too many secrets.

699
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:40,664
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doin' up?
