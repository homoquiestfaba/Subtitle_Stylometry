1
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,227
- You are not just a mom.

2
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,198
You are a hot, hot,
single lady.

3
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,370
- Oh, god.
- Mom!

4
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,306
- Just a second, sweetie!

5
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,244
You are a well-educated
female person...

6
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,680
With a very big...

7
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,114
Set of tits.

8
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,086
- Mommy!
- Fuck me. Coming!

9
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:07,693
All right, momma's bringing in
the big board. Let's do this.

10
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,362
Gracie, do you have
your show-and-tell, honey?

11
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,232
Yes, you do. Good girl!

12
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,567
Will, buddy, helmet and pads?

13
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,071
Are those boys still giving you
a hard time at practice?

14
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,508
Okay, well, screw football.

15
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,478
How about glee club, huh?
Show tunes!

16
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,685
- Mommy, can we listen
to singing music
on the way to school?

17
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,121
- No, honey, I like to listen
to news in the morning.

18
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,590
- Can I play on your phone?
- Nope.

19
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,594
Amelia!

20
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,397
You know we don't do screams
before school.

21
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,200
He took his diaper off! Poop!

22
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,902
- Oh! Fuck!
- Poop!

23
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,901
- Good afternoon, Jen.

24
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,470
Gorgeous day we're having,
huh?

25
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,872
Got that sun dialed up to a 10.

26
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,075
It is. It's so bright out,
do you really need that flashlight?

27
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,578
- I probably wouldn't have seen
Greyson pick his nose

28
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,749
and wipe it on the back
of your seat without it, huh?
Don't worry. They all do it.

29
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,417
I got you.
- Oh.

30
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,552
- Hey!
- Shit!

31
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,323
- Owen is begging
for a play date with the boys.
You got to come over.

32
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,925
- Oh! Oh, hey,
this is the call I'm expecting.

33
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,497
Silent. It's on silent.

34
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,565
- Hey, Sally.

35
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,436
- Whoa, uh--
- orange cones, no phones.

36
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,104
- I was buying milk.
I'm out of milk.

37
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,006
- Well, there's a trader Joe's
right around the corner.

38
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,508
- Yeah, well,
i don't do markets, okay?

39
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,276
So please just give me
my phone, Melissa.

40
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,879
Uh, uh, melody.

41
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,580
I mean...
- It's Melanie, Kate.

42
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,617
God, we've been going to
the same school for five years?

43
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,820
- Just give me my phone, please,
<i> Melanie.</i>

44
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,023
Hey, what the...?

45
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,359
- Are those car seats
even installed properly?

46
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,095
And does this beauty
even have anti-lock brakes?

47
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,597
- Yes. Obviously it does.

48
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,533
And power windows.

49
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,369
- Seriously?

50
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,979
- We have a big day
and then teacher Sherry

51
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,916
witnessed Amelia offering
her spot on the green rug.

52
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,986
The empathy that displays,
Amelia, it's... it's profound.

53
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,490
Come on, you two get in here.

54
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,125
You both are settling in
beautifully

55
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,294
to your first month at school.
Aren't you?

56
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,496
- Yeah.
- Bit of a relief. Right?
- Yes.

57
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,731
All right, bug, come on.
Let's go get our stuff, huh?

58
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,401
- Have an amazing day.
So great to see you.
- Thank you. You too.

59
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:13,338
- Yay! Okay, hold still.
- Oh, that's one cute cubby.

60
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,742
Rose-budding really takes it
to the next level.

61
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,344
- Rose-budding!

62
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,746
Ooh, that'll get a lot of likes,
right?

63
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:25,650
- Now I get the iPad, mommy?
- As soon as we get in the car,
sweetie pie, okay?

64
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,420
As soon as we get in the car.
And don't forget,

65
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,655
you get to sleep
at your daddy's house tonight

66
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,958
and mommy gets
some alone time.

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,826
- Can't even remember
what that's like.

68
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:38,163
- Hey, I know
this is kind of last minute,

69
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,798
but Melanie
- you know, grace's mom? -

70
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,967
she and I are going out
tomorrow night.

71
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,669
I got us a reservation
in this new tapas place.

72
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,872
Would you wanna join?
- Uh, topless?

73
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,708
- Yeah, topless place,
i thought, you know,
sexy dancers, little appetizers.

74
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,443
No. Tapas.
- Oh, my god!

75
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,512
- Tapas.
- Tapas!

76
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,982
Yeah, no, tapas. Wow, yeah,
that would be really nice.
Thank you.

77
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,551
- Yeah, we like to do
this fun mom dinners
every couple of weeks.

78
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,820
You know, lots of wine, no kids.
It's kind of heaven.

79
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,122
- Yeah, sounds like it.
- Hi, ladies.
- Hey.

80
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,192
- Hey, Mel, guess what.
Emily is gonna join us
for dinner tomorrow night.

81
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,127
- Oh, fantastic.
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's great.

82
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,496
I love welcoming new moms
to the happy days community.

83
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,465
I can't wait to hear your story,
Emily.

84
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,901
- Um, would it be okay
if I invited Kate?

85
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,571
- Kate with the twin boys?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,406
- Wait.
Are you friends with her?

87
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,308
- Yeah, yeah, we went
to high school together.

88
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,945
That's how I got Amelia in here
so last minute when we moved.

89
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,649
- Kate doesn't usually do stuff
with us other moms,

90
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,918
or even return my emails,
but I know she got it,

91
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,553
'cause I have
that sent-return thing.

92
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,055
But since you guys are so close,
if you wanna invite her,

93
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,157
I mean, that's fine,
she could come with us, yeah.

94
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,426
- That'd be wonderful.
- Okay, no,
I'll mention it to her later.

95
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,727
That sounds great.
Thank you, guys.

96
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,596
Got to go. Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.

97
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,866
- I like your skirt.
It's so pretty.
- Oh, thanks.

98
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,503
- I bet my left tit
that bitch Kate doesn't come.

99
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,916
- Hello, gorgeous.

100
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:07,953
Shut up!

101
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,022
- Mom!!
- He took it!

102
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,958
I'm in the playoff!

103
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,694
Where are you?!

104
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,265
Where are you?!

105
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,276
- Whoa, whoa!

106
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,612
One at a time, dudes,
one at a time.

107
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,581
- Make them shut up, okay?
I'm in the playoffs!

108
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,652
- The twins knocked over
my legos and I have to poop.

109
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,455
- Oh, get in here, go.
Get in there, go.

110
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,758
- He took my sabre!
- Because it's mine!

111
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,560
- Okay.

112
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,064
There you go. Downstairs.

113
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,833
Have fun.

114
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,668
Daddy's calling you.

115
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,744
Hey. Sorry I couldn't talk
to you at pick-up.

116
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,312
I can't take hanging around
that place.

117
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,913
-<i> Oh, guess who got</i>
<i> a poop facial</i>

118
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,149
<i> and taught our kid</i>
<i> how to say the f word?</i>

119
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:15,620
- Oh, wait, you had shit
on your face and you're worried

120
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,123
<i>your kid learned the word fuck?</i>
- You don't understand.

121
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,959
I never swear
in front of them, is the thing.

122
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,328
- Mm, shit, I'd be more worried
about pink eye.

123
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,196
-<i> How is it possible</i>
<i> that this kid</i>

124
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,265
still has the s-h-i-t-s?

125
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,934
- Well, now you know
what you're really
missing out on

126
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,803
when you're pulling
those 12-hour workdays.

127
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,172
- It's incredible to me
that my life still revolves

128
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,142
around other people's s-h-i-t.
I can't believe it.

129
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,777
- Oh, I can.

130
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,048
- You're good at this.

131
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,217
Do it again?
- Okay.

132
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,686
- I love it, Emily.

133
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,288
You look beautiful.
- Oh, really?

134
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,692
I feel like you've just never
seen me with my hair brushed.
- Hey, I'm home.

135
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,360
Hey...
- Hey.

136
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,495
- Daddy's home!
- Oh, Amelia bedelia!

137
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,798
How you doing?
Oh, my goodness.

138
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,368
Oh, gosh, are we busy
making some drawings here?

139
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,903
What the...

140
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,872
Wow, honey, this is, um...

141
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,908
This is an interesting one.

142
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,377
What exactly is going on here?

143
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,180
- It's a whale spraying mommy.
- Um...

144
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,216
I... I guess I didn't know mommy
was into that sort of thing,

145
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,685
but, uh, okay.

146
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,754
All right.

147
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,557
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

148
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,426
Okay, I'm gonna, uh...
I'll just get changed and...

149
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,398
- He's got this thing
about messing up my lipstick.

150
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,368
- Is this, like,
top chef or something?

151
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,004
Are we gonna be judged
on our work? Thank you.

152
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,740
- No, it's a delivery thing,
man.

153
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,075
It's a startup,
which I should've invested in.

154
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,244
It's all local and organic
and sustainable.

155
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,780
And they just drop it off
for you.

156
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:52,417
- What drops it off,
an electric tractor
being pulled by a rescue dog?

157
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,419
Thanks, Kate.

158
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,588
- This is literally
farm to table, you guys.

159
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,690
Farm to table.

160
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,126
- Straight from the farm.
- Straight to the table.
- To the...

161
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,129
- Right to the table.
Are you kidding me?

162
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,064
- There's no middle man.
- Oh, my god.

163
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,099
Well, thank you so much
for having us over

164
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,435
so we could make
our own dinner. This is great.

165
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:15,240
- Kate, I think it's awesome,
i think it's super creative,
and I like it.

166
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,710
- Thanks, em.
- Don't cut yourself, now.

167
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:23,081
- All right. Let's do this.
Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

168
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,117
Right. Do you wanna do the...
Chop up the veggies?

169
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,719
- What's up with the sauce?

170
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,888
- Just a little--
- oh, no, no, no, hold on.

171
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,792
Throw the veggies in first
and then the sauce goes--

172
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,761
- I think it'll just--
- no, no.
It's like this for a reason.

173
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,731
You know, sometimes,
recipes are in a specific order
for a reason.

174
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,000
It's gonna screw
the whole thing up if...
- Ahem.

175
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,835
- It cooks together...
Okay, it's fine.

176
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,470
- Did you guys...

177
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,739
Do you have any of that
yellow sauce leftover?

178
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,074
- Mm-hmm, yep.
- Kind of wasted all of ours.

179
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,743
Um...

180
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,946
Yeah, I think, uh, this move
is gonna be great for us.

181
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,581
- Yeah.
- And great for us, em.

182
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,917
We get to hang like
the old times, just the girls.

183
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,186
- Speaking of just the girls,
a couple of the moms

184
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,521
from school asked me out
for a fun mom dinner.

185
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,758
- That sounds awful.
- Hey, it's a fun mom dinner.

186
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,661
How can it not be,
you know, fun?

187
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,930
- Shut the fuck up, hon.
Which ones were they?

188
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,498
- One of them was named Jamie.

189
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,100
- I know her. I mean,
i don't "know" know her.

190
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,669
I follow her on instagram.

191
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,871
She's a bit of an over-sharer.

192
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,974
- Seriously, Andrew?
Jesus, I mean, some wives
would be pissed about this.

193
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,043
I think I'm just embarrassed
for you. Here.

194
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,311
- Whoa.

195
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,780
- #sharedcustody?

196
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,382
#metime?

197
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,152
Fuck, if it's me time,
why feel the need
to share it with us?

198
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,553
Who's the other mom?
- Melanie.

199
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,222
- Okay,
that woman is bad-shit crazy.

200
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,124
I think she runs a fight club
in the helping hand yard.

201
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,194
- No, they're trying to be nice.
- You have to get out of it.

202
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,029
Just say Wyatt's sick
or something.

203
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,466
- No, don't listen to her, em,
and you should go too, babe.

204
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,569
- Honey, I think this is great.
You should make more friends,

205
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,638
you should, you know,
widen your circle.

206
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Widen your circle?
- That's super sexual.

207
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,543
- Yeah, maybe it is sexual.
So what?

208
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,145
- You're just gonna widen it,
take a look around.

209
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,147
- Oh! Speaking...

210
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,652
Of sexual innuendo...
Look what I found in the move.

211
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,921
- What is it?
- Oh, my god.

212
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,825
It's our sex questionnaire
from sophomore year.

213
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,894
- We answered every question
with Jake Ryan.

214
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:19,564
Yes! And it marked the birth
of the I love Jake club.

215
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,432
- The I love who?

216
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,768
- Jake Ryan
from sixteen candles.
That was our movie.

217
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,037
Jake Ryan
is like the perfect guy.

218
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,672
- I've never heard
about any of this.

219
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,707
- There were two presidents
and two members.

220
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,410
- You guys started a club and
there's only two people in it?

221
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,980
That's adorable and sad.
Let me see this.

222
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,185
- Yeah, you two can't be
in the club.
- What?!

223
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,837
- Hey.
- Hey.

224
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,844
- All yours.

225
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,623
You wanna watch
a little John Oliver?

226
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,860
- No.

227
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:30,234
Oh, hey, would you mind taking
Amelia to school tomorrow
so I can go work out?

228
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,937
- No... fucking... way.

229
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,073
- What?

230
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,709
- Mommy!

231
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,716
- Hey, shhh, shhh, shhh...

232
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,318
Mommy's here.

233
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,207
Don't forget to go pee-pee.
Remember last time?

234
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,610
- Did you really just tell me
to go pee-pee?

235
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,980
- I did.
- 'Cause I don't have to.
I came prepared.

236
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,783
- Oh!
- Sam's pull-up is tight
as fuck!

237
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,551
- Oh, that is so wrong.

238
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:24,122
- You push out two more kids
and see if you don't need one.

239
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,292
Hey, what's going on with you?

240
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,861
Tom stuff again?

241
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,362
- No.

242
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,864
Yes.

243
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,666
- You seemed happy last night.

244
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,870
Please tell me you went home
and had drunk sex.
- Oh, please, hardly.

245
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,506
Tom has zero interest in sex.
Forget sex.

246
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,142
I haven't had a hug in months.
- Oh.

247
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,712
- The last hug I got, I think,
was from teacher Sherry.

248
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,514
Kind of felt a little something.

249
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,517
Okay, ladies, positions, please.

250
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,719
Come on, ladies,
positions, please.

251
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,988
- We need to talk about this.
- Dinner tonight?

252
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,557
I wanna see those knees
to cheeks.

253
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,927
Five, six, seven, eight,
and go down, down,

254
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,963
down, down, down, down!
That's it. Ugh!

255
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,000
- Good thing
this is an overnight.

256
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,569
- Whoo!
Ooh, down, down, down!

257
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,740
Ooh, higher!
Let me hear you say whoo!

258
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,775
Whoo!
- Whoo!

259
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,383
- I do not get this. Do you know
how to do instagram?

260
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,251
I'm stuck.

261
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,021
Hey, good timing,
i just got a text from Kate
a minute ago

262
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,423
who's gonna be here in five,
so...
- Oh, I texted Andrew.

263
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,625
We're gonna go hang out
over there for a bit.

264
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,428
- Oh, are you sure
it's a good idea,
'cause it's a school night,

265
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,199
and you know if Wyatt
falls asleep in the car,
he's never gonna transfer.

266
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:45,536
- Yeah, it will be great, babe.
The kids will have fun.
- Oh, fun, what a concept.

267
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,639
- No, you don't get to do
the "we never have fun anymore"
thing.

268
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,375
I'm babysitting tonight
so you can go out and have fun.

269
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,944
- You're babysitting, tom?!
- Yeah.

270
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,580
- It's not babysitting
when they're your kids.

271
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,549
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's parenting.

272
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,085
- You're splitting hairs there,
but, yeah, sure, I mean, both.

273
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,787
- His green blanket
is in the dryer.

274
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,556
Do not forget it if you go out.
You'll be so sorry.

275
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,392
Are you listening
to any of this right now?

276
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,596
- Come on. Uh, yeah, yeah,
the diaper and the, um,

277
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,498
the blankets, it's no problem.

278
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
- Okay.
- All right, you know what?

279
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,735
I need to take a quick shower.
- All right.

280
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,138
Good luck with that.

281
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,173
Have a good night.
- Okay.

282
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,975
- Goodbye.

283
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,776
Goodbye.

284
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,779
- But I was just thinking
i needed to take
a quick shower.

285
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,426
- Please.
- What?

286
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,829
- Tell me you didn't do this.

287
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,499
- I kind of did.

288
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,836
- Looks like
your classic ambush move.

289
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,639
- That Emily is sneaky.

290
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,240
- I like her.

291
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,511
- I thought this was just gonna
be the two of us,

292
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,713
talking about you and tom
and shitty life stuff.

293
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,515
- I know.
I didn't wanna come alone.

294
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,218
I'm sorry I tricked you, okay?

295
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,221
I just wanted a night where
i am not thinking about tom.

296
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,056
I need it.

297
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,026
- Oprah? Gayle?

298
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,028
Care to open up
your friendship circle?

299
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,863
Let's go, come on.

300
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,666
- One hour, that is it.
And you fucking owe me.

301
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,201
- Come on.
- I love you.

302
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,169
- Melanie, you look hot.
- You look great.

303
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,372
- I mean, what else
are we supposed to bring
to snack share?

304
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,542
I mean, we've got three kids
allergic to gluten, a tree nut,

305
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:35,213
two soys, and that kid
with the zipper thing?

306
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,049
- Oh, that kid is not allergic
to zippers. No fucking way.

307
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,651
- But it's on the list.
- He's just scared of them.

308
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,253
That's more
of an emotional allergy.

309
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,355
- Yes, I did the rotc thing
in college,

310
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,491
and I came this close to joining
the armed forces, you know?

311
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,260
I still think about it.

312
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,395
You cannot get me out
of my 'tigues on the weekends.

313
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:55,066
- I miss telling people
at parties that I was a lawyer,
you know?

314
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,068
Except for I never went
to parties,

315
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,704
because I never left
the office before 9:00.

316
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,006
And then there was,
like, the rare occasion

317
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,275
that I did make it home
by bedtime

318
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,611
and Amelia was calling
her nanny "mama."

319
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:11,182
- Now that Lexie is with Theo
part of the time,
i actually have time to myself.

320
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,517
So I started consulting
with this engineering firm.

321
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,720
Plus I'm training
for a half-marathon,

322
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,923
and I get to sleep -
and I'm talking real sleep.

323
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,525
- Now, that is why
you look so good.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

324
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,394
You know,
she would never admit it,

325
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,363
but she was my saving grace.

326
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,632
Some of my friends
got so weird
after I got separated.

327
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,900
You would not believe,
once you're single,

328
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,204
that these ladies
do not want you
around their husbands.

329
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,374
I never saw it coming
with my friends,
but not Melanie.

330
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,776
You were always
inviting me out all the time.

331
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,946
Sometimes, she even had to use
brute physical force
to get me out of the house.

332
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,715
- That I believe.
- Oh, she speaks.

333
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,450
What should we talk about,
Kate?

334
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,552
You know,
so we're interesting to you.

335
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,055
I mean, we've all shared.
What's your deal?

336
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,390
- Melanie.
- Oh, god.

337
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,125
That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

338
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:57,428
- I don't, actually.
- Emily, I can speak for myself.

339
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,630
It's true. Don't wanna be here.

340
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,566
What can I say? I'm mom'd out.

341
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:06,137
First there were the moms
from when Lucas
started school,

342
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,674
and then the Sam moms,
more play dates,
more school meetings,

343
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,976
the juicing, the coffees.
I'm over it.

344
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,312
I don't wanna know
what birthday parties
are being planned.

345
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,847
I don't give a fuck
about the best mommy and me yoga

346
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,816
or mommy and me anything.

347
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,985
And I especially
don't wanna hear

348
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,587
that super-cute thing
their kid said, did,
wrote, or fucking sang,

349
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,956
I mean, come on,
do you want me to go on?

350
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,125
- No, that's okay.
I think we got the idea.

351
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,795
But just for the record,
Melanie and I do not juice.

352
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,997
- I knew you were a bitch.
I knew it.

353
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,467
- Melanie, I'm sorry,
i know you don't like me

354
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,170
because I'm not engaged
and involved in--

355
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,372
- no, no, no, no, no, no.
My problem with you

356
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,508
isn't that you don't do shit
while the rest of us
do the shit.

357
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,510
My problem with you
is that you walk around

358
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,846
like you're too good
to do any shit at all.

359
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:52,850
- You took my phone yesterday,
for fucksake.
And my car wasn't even moving.

360
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,953
Jesus, just admit
you take stuff a little too far.

361
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:59,390
- When you admit that
you were texting and driving.
- I was buying milk!

362
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,093
A mother can never run out
of milk!

363
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,466
- Come on.
- You know what?

364
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,701
This is bullshit, I'm done here.
Let's get the cheque.

365
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,204
- No, Melanie, come on.
No, no, no, don't go.

366
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,307
I love that you're
a traffic-safety person.
- Thank you.

367
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,344
- Come on, you don't wanna miss
the tartufo.
- You're right. I'm not leaving.

368
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,180
I want my tartufo.
And I want a scotch.

369
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,383
Because then you got
your something sweet

370
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,985
and you got something
to cut the sweet.

371
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,087
She should leave.

372
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,022
- Oh, with pleasure.

373
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,724
- Oh, uh...

374
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,127
She drove.
- No.

375
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,863
- Mel, this is not good.
Come on,

376
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,865
we all have to see one another
at school tomorrow

377
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,067
and for the whole rest
of the year. Don't do this.

378
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:48,072
- Fine, but I cannot believe
I'm missing forensic files
for this shit.

379
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,940
You know, order me a scotch.

380
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,942
Three fingers, y cube.

381
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,421
- Don't even think about trying
to convince me to come back in.

382
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,456
- Don't worry.

383
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,391
I'm just gonna wait here
a minute

384
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,627
and then tell them
i couldn't find you.

385
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,131
What the hell is that?

386
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,168
- Something you could
desperately use.

387
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,338
Here, peace pipe.

388
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:30,881
- So basically you just need
to choose the picture you want--

389
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,918
- oh, my god. Jamie,
you matched with someone!

390
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,486
- I did?
- That's so exciting.

391
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,722
- Yikes. I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

392
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,724
Ah, dating at my age?

393
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,794
Why do all the men
look like weary grandpas?

394
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:47,298
- No, no, no, no, come on.
It's fun to look.

395
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,500
Let's start with looking.

396
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,502
He's cute.

397
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,806
- I used to smoke the doobage
from time to time.

398
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,210
Yeah, right, I'll toke up.

399
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,847
But you're still a massive cunt.
You know that, right?

400
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,186
- I'm guessing you haven't
done this in a while.

401
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,955
- Yeah, it's been like 15 years.

402
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,958
- Here's how it works
in the 21st century. See this?

403
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,327
- Yeah.
- You push it down.

404
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,996
- Okay. Okay.

405
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,971
Okay,
now we're cooking with gas.

406
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,542
That's a friend I remember.

407
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:38,549
Wow. Maybe there's more to you
than being just the big asshole.

408
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,019
- Wait, I'm confused.
Am I an asshole or a cunt?

409
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,155
Because there is a
big difference between the two.

410
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,824
- True.

411
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:49,760
Although sometimes in the dark
my husband can't tell.

412
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,034
- Have you heard anything
about a... fight club
on the helping hand yard?

413
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,137
- Huh? No.
- You know, never mind.
- I never heard about that.

414
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,739
- Hi.
- Hey.

415
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,575
- What'd we miss?
- Good evening.

416
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,310
- Good evening.

417
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,078
- Oh, we're gonna need
a bigger boat.

418
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,016
- Yeah, I think we need
one more of, uh...

419
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,684
Everything.
- Everyone.

420
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:17,054
- Everything.
- Thank you. This one's mine.

421
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,923
- Oh, I'm so glad
we're doing this.

422
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,659
And Emily acted
like it was gonna be so hard

423
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:24,094
to bring the kids over here.
- Yeah, man, totally.

424
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,696
Kate gets like that too
sometimes,

425
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,365
like super wound up about stuff.
Just pay no mind.

426
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,834
- Yeah.

427
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,304
Oh, what's going on, buddy?

428
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,874
Oh, okay.

429
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,211
All right.
- He wants his blankie.

430
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,447
- Blankie?

431
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,883
His blankie?

432
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,252
His blankie.

433
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,120
Oh, fuck.

434
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,259
- Marijuana makes me
really paranoid,
but I'll take a little puff.

435
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,629
Yeah, Jamie.

436
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:02,900
- Pass that.
There's something so classic
about a perfectly rolled joint.

437
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,202
- Mm, yeah.
- I like to go old school
sometimes,

438
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,871
with a classic
Brazilian bikini wax.

439
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,307
- Brazilian's retro now?

440
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,242
- Oh, not even.
They're like totally out.

441
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,579
- What?
- You think that's crazy?
You got to check out this.

442
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:18,382
- Look at this.
- I'm hungry.
- This is crazy. Vajazzling.

443
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,284
- Oh, my god!
- Whoa.

444
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,987
- Very popular now.
- Wait.

445
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:28,392
She shaves off all the hair
on her vagina god's given her
and takes a handful of crystals

446
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,428
and some Elmer's glue
and sprinkles up
a little design?

447
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,063
Is that what she does?

448
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,432
What kind of woman wants sand
on her vagina--

449
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,601
what are you doing
in there?

450
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,671
I see a lot of feet.
- I got it.

451
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:45,309
Hi. How are you?

452
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,177
What a cute little outfit.

453
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,979
Is it your birthday?

454
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,682
- Are you smoking in here?
- Of course we're not smoking.

455
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,852
- You know what?
I think the manager would like
to know what's going on.

456
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,453
- Hey, wait a minute.

457
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,956
I have an idea.

458
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,459
How about we send
an ice-cream sundae
over to your table?

459
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,529
You know, like a little surprise
for keeping a secret?

460
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,434
- I want a steak.
- Damn.

461
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:13,270
- New York strip, medium rare.

462
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,206
And a coke.
- Fine.
- Fine.

463
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,045
Great talking to you.

464
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:26,383
- That little girl
is fucking intense!

465
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:30,287
If that's what I'm missing out
on then, no, thank you.

466
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,157
- Oh, no. Did we just...?

467
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,192
- Oh, shoot!
- Oh, my god.

468
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,197
- Okay! Oh, my god!

469
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,702
- Let's go through the back.
We don't wanna get caught
in here!

470
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,009
- Oh, my god!

471
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,378
- Do you hear that?
Are those sirens?

472
00:26:56,582 --> 00:27:00,684
- Ladies, I believe this is
a dine-and-dash situation.
Let's move out!

473
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,420
If we're staying out later,
i got to text my hubby.

474
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,457
- Oh, good idea.
And I'll text Andrew
and he can tell tom.

475
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,164
- Okay.

476
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,621
Oh, wait! Ladies, ladies,
hold up, hold up.

477
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,957
Come here.
Ladies, quick question.

478
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,459
Do you mind
if we make a quick pit stop?

479
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:46,196
I love me some walgreens.
And you're gonna love it, too,
because guess what.

480
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,065
Boom,
i got a motherfucking gift card!

481
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:51,068
- Hey, bud, see this is same
colour as your blankie.

482
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,237
Maybe that works.
What do you think?

483
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:57,141
Nope. Okay.
I think we have to go, man.

484
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,943
- Daddy, you promised
i could watch it.

485
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,045
Please, please, please!

486
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,782
- I know, honey. I'm sorry.
- You know what, man?
I got an idea.

487
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,117
Hey, come with me.

488
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,655
This way, please.

489
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:15,392
- Where are we going?
- Step right up
to the magic swing set.

490
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,629
Right in here, my man.
- It's all right, buddy.

491
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,465
- Bring him on in. May I?

492
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,600
- Sure. What are you doing?

493
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,103
- Don't question me.
I got four of these.

494
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,472
That's what I thought.
- I have two.

495
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,275
- I got myself involved
in the swing set.

496
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,344
Can I have that, please?
Thank you.

497
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:37,447
I know.
Can I just give you one tip?

498
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,951
You might wanna get yourself
like a soft, fuzzy blanket,

499
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,086
instead
of this piece-of-shit towel.

500
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,989
- Yeah, I forgot the blanket.
And that's your towel,
by the way.

501
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,160
- Oh. Well, then we have
disgusting towels.

502
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,497
All right, watch and learn.

503
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,599
Watch.

504
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,203
- What?

505
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,745
Whoa. Whoa.

506
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,318
That is fucking incredible.

507
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,513
- Oh, hey, here's our car.
I sprang for an SUV,

508
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,515
'cause I'm a bad-ass bitch
like that.

509
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,351
- Yeah!
- You got us a car? Why?

510
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:49,653
- Uh, to get around?

511
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,989
- No, no, it's good, all right?
We're gonna leave
the crime scene to cool out.

512
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,590
We're gonna leave
the cars there to deflect.

513
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,058
And that's our little Katie
right there,

514
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,261
'cause, whoo, yeah,
you got our six!

515
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,897
- I don't even know
what you're talking about!
What the fuck is six?

516
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,532
- Oh, come on,
that's military jargon, right?
- Okay.

517
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,869
- Yeah, six is back.
Katie, you got our six, girl.

518
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,605
- Roger that, you crazy cunt.
- Yeah, I'm a crazy cunt.

519
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,407
- Wow.

520
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,610
- Guys, I got a bad feeling
about getting in these things.

521
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,747
You hear about these guys,
they ride around all day,

522
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:20,584
and they pick up the last ride
and just snap like crazy.

523
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,620
- They do not.
- It happens all the time.
- Stop.

524
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,123
- Man, Jamie,
you weren't messing around

525
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,392
when you said you get paranoid.

526
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,360
- I know. And the problem is,

527
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,630
I always had Theo with me
when I got high.

528
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:37,601
He took care of me
when I started to get like this.
He was like my person.

529
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,503
- I'm gonna be your person.

530
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,206
You don't have to worry.
I got you, girl.

531
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,208
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

532
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,477
- That was a fun night,
you guys.

533
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,447
- Em, there's no fucking way
I'm doing bedtime tonight.

534
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:54,818
I mean, if I am staying out
with you gals,
i need to get more supplies.

535
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,821
- Ooh, I better stay out here.
I'm done with that stuff.

536
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,790
- No, we're sticking together.
Like sister-wives.

537
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,792
Come on, don't worry about it.

538
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:05,295
It's like crabtree & Evelyn,
but with weed.

539
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,898
- All right.

540
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,501
- For fucksake, Wayne,
you know who I am.

541
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:14,104
Now please, just play nice.
I have brought friends with me.

542
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,607
- Oh, very nice.
Ladies, my name is Wayne.

543
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,144
I am your marijuana sommelier
for the evening.

544
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,747
Oh, and here's Brady.
- My ears are burning.

545
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,482
- He's my partner.
- Hey, Kate!

546
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,285
- Brady! How are you?
- Thanks for coming in.

547
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,820
Hi, guys.
- Hey.

548
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,621
- Hey, look, anything you want,
we've got it.

549
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,423
If we don't have it,
we'll grow it.

550
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,759
If we can't grow it,
we're gonna get it

551
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,594
from some factory
in some godforsaken land.

552
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,162
- You know what,
you know what?

553
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,298
I think we should set them up

554
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,301
with our selection of stuff
that's for mothers,

555
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,036
'cause, you know,
we love the mothers.

556
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,637
- We love our mothers.
- Pfft.

557
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,206
- Sounds good.

558
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,643
- Let's begin with this one.

559
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,646
I think you might enjoy.
It's Ruth bader ganja.

560
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,016
- You guys fans
of supreme court justices?

561
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,651
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, you might've heard
of Ruth bader ginsburg.

562
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,321
It's now Ruth bader ganja.
- Ruth bader ganja.

563
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,490
We were playing around
with John Stevens for a while,

564
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,458
but we couldn't really think
of anything for that.

565
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,727
- But for you
i think it's very good,

566
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,197
- because it will get you...
- ....Supremely high.

567
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:17,367
- But at the same time,
you'll still be able
to mediate family disputes

568
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,237
or decide on
what you might be cooking or...

569
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,640
- It's also a really fun weed
when you need to concentrate.

570
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,076
You can build a castle
out of legos.

571
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,545
You can play
with calico critters all night.

572
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,414
Shopkins, and you have
total concentration.

573
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,549
- We put just a pinch
of Adderall in there,

574
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,684
which gives you
just that extra dash of focus.

575
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,320
- What?
- Yeah. It'd be cool
if you didn't say anything,

576
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,423
just because it's, you know,
it's very illegal.

577
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,324
- But maybe can we talk
about edibles?

578
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,093
- Oh.
- Oh, absolutely.

579
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:46,063
Which, by the way, reminds me,
do any of you have glaucoma?

580
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,565
If so, we are giving away
some free gummy worms.

581
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,233
- I have glaucoma.
- Oh, excellent!

582
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,003
- You have glaucoma?
- Oh, you're gonna love these--

583
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:56,206
- you do not have glaucoma!
- Oh, wait, you're kidding.

584
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,109
You don't have glaucoma.
No, I get it.

585
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,877
You guys are so our speed.
- Yeah.

586
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,413
- 'Cause you play around,
you can joke, you have a good--

587
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,416
- we do the same thing.
We joke around each other
even at home.

588
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,452
- It's so crazy.
People don't even get
our humour.

589
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,120
- And the wives are, like:
"What the fuck--

590
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,888
- ...you guys talking about?"
- That's why we...

591
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,124
- Don't hang out with them much,
but these are really good.

592
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,859
These are called
good night moons.

593
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,128
You know the children's book,
good night moon?

594
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,764
- Of course.
- Obviously.
And then what mother doesn't?

595
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,866
- And we went ahead
and added the s.

596
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,434
You know, good night moons.
- Moons.

597
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,736
- This is delicious.
- Wayne.

598
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,972
Somebody's discovered our balls.

599
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,741
We make those here
- oh, I like it.

600
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,977
- It will fuck you up.
It's really intense.

601
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,645
- You know how you have
that concentrated detergent.

602
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,648
"This one little thimbleful
for the whole washer?"

603
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,784
But yeah,
because it's that concentrated.

604
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:44,421
- How much of your own products
do you get
your little paws into?

605
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,623
- Oh, we don't smoke.
- I don't do it.

606
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,225
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

607
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:51,128
- My only addiction is mad men.
Oh, forget it.

608
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,497
- He loves it.
- Every week. Forget it.

609
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,468
- Tom. Tom, you got to see this.

610
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,037
Kate's partying
with the school moms.

611
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,808
It's on the bubble-bath chick's
instagram.

612
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,644
- You know,
it really is embarrassing
that you follow her.

613
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:11,081
- Yeah. I know.
And it's embarrassing
that she doesn't follow me back.

614
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:14,284
- Okay, I gave Amelia
a five-minute warning.

615
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:17,954
- Oh, oh, grab that door,
grab that door!
- What?

616
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,692
- Uh... it locks
when it's not supposed to.

617
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,662
That's my fault.
I should've told you.

618
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,831
We are momentarily
locked out.

619
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,133
- What do you mean,
momentarily locked out?

620
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:33,136
- What I said: Momentarily.
We keep a spare down here

621
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,539
in one of those
fake-dog-poop things.

622
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,440
Why don't we just do this?

623
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,143
Why don't we just let them
finish their movie in there,

624
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,379
and me and you
will chill out here with Wyatt?

625
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,980
- Oh, yeah, well, actually,
i was hoping

626
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,016
to get the kids home
before Emily got back.

627
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,718
- Oh, well, Kate texted and said
they were gonna stay out later.

628
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,520
- What?
- Oh.

629
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,255
I think I'm supposed
to tell you that.

630
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,993
- Okay. Yeah, sure.

631
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,461
- Mm...

632
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,164
I haven't licked a ball
in a decade.

633
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:05,335
- It got you your divorce.
- Do not tell me
you still blow your husbands.

634
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,471
- I never blew Theo. I mean,
maybe for like a minute
on his birthday.

635
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,207
- And divorce.

636
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,975
- Sometimes it's just easier,
you know,

637
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,544
like a quick one during
a commercial break of kimmel.

638
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,881
Andrew's psyched
and I don't have to have him
lying all over me.

639
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,482
- I hear that, sister.

640
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,484
My preference
is antiques roadshow.

641
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:25,055
There's no commercials,
but I just pop down there.

642
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,057
Me blowing those nuts.

643
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,759
I'm back in time
for the ming dynasty office.

644
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,662
- Oh, lord, well, just imagine
having to be single again.

645
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,265
It's all back on the table
for me now.

646
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,235
What if I have to do anal again?
- Again?
- Look at this way.

647
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:42,239
Maybe you'll meet the guy
that makes you
wanna do anal again.

648
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,841
- Thank god I never did.

649
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:48,178
- Emily's one of those rare
angels who actually married
the first guy she had sex with.

650
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,513
- What?!
- No fucking way!
- No, I didn't. Come on.

651
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,083
- Don't hit me! It's true!
- No, I was young.

652
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:55,952
- You guys,
i think we're being followed.
We're being followed.

653
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,088
Do you hear the footsteps?
- Yeah, ours.

654
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,590
- I think you've had
one too many licks.

655
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,192
How about we get a drink
over there,

656
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,960
cool out for a bit?
- Okay, let's do that.

657
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,695
- Oh, we got a runner!

658
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,330
- Shit.

659
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,036
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

660
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,437
Excuse me.

661
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,108
Oh, wow.

662
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,811
You have beautiful,
beautiful bone structure.

663
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,149
- Thank you.

664
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,318
How about a coke?
- Oh, no.

665
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,121
Actually, I was gonna get
a vodka-and-tonic,
because it's transparent.

666
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:35,325
That way if some weirdo
tries to slip something in it,
i can see it to protect myself.

667
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:39,829
- Okay, how about a sprite?
Also transparent.
See? Look at that.

668
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,999
- I'd love a glenlivit,
one cube. Thank you so much.
- Glenlivit, one cube.

669
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,768
- And can we grab
two house whites?

670
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,771
- House whites, all right.
Here you go. All right.

671
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,773
Let me guess...

672
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,574
Mom's night out?

673
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,843
- Again?
- Oh, come on.

674
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:58,114
- Should we be offended
you just immediately assumed
that we are all moms?

675
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,216
- No. You should be flattered.

676
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,357
- It says moms.

677
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,292
- Yeah, I got two of them.
- Oh.

678
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,694
- Good eye, by the way.

679
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,495
Usually,
people don't notice that.

680
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:16,466
- I got a thing for details.
It's like a bad lawyer habit.

681
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,868
I'm Emily.
- Luke.

682
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,770
- Luke as in...

683
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,972
This your place, Luke?

684
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,808
- That's me.
- Cool.

685
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,976
A little help over here?

686
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,545
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Okay.

687
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:31,014
- What's gotten to you, em?
- Wine.

688
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,049
- Weed.

689
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,019
I am so sorry
that I tricked you into tonight.

690
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,654
- Ah, you know what?

691
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,823
I hate to admit it,
but I'm having a great time.

692
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,458
- It's kind of a perfect night,
right?

693
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,226
- You know what would make it
even more perfect,

694
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,228
would be if Jake Ryan
just like wandered in here.

695
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,064
- Oh, god, Jake Ryan.
- Oh!

696
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,200
I love that guy!

697
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:52,402
Sixteen candles.

698
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:55,739
- Oh, for me that was all about
Anthony Michael hall.
- What?

699
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,842
- Farmer Ted. Ugh!
- What?
- Yeah, I love his little fuss.

700
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,177
- You do not!
- I do! I can't help myself.

701
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,080
- Oh, my god!
- Put him right in there,
bounce him around.

702
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:08,017
- No, I have to say, for me,
Jake Ryan, he was my ideal.

703
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,853
He ruined romance for me.
Honestly.

704
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:12,689
- It's true, because no guy
could ever live up to him.

705
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,758
No guy ever will live up to him.

706
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,493
- Well, he's a character
in a movie.

707
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:19,562
- I always liked
some kind of wonderful.

708
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,031
- Some kind of wonderful. Yes.

709
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,833
Eric stoltz, Lea Thompson--

710
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,536
- no, Eric stoltz,
Mary Stuart Masterson.

711
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,572
- Yes! God, I can't believe
i forgot that! Yes!

712
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:32,342
God, Mary Stuart
had that killer little haircut.

713
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,612
- Super cute.
- She was so cool.
I just want to be her.

714
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,050
Excuse me?
Can I get a drink, please?

715
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,086
- Check you out.
- Don't judge.

716
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,621
- Oh, I am not.

717
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,356
I mean,
a little bit of male attention

718
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,291
might be just what you need
tonight.

719
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,096
- How do you feel about two
delicious ice-cold beverages?

720
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,598
- Yeah, all right.
- I brewed that myself.

721
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,267
In the shed.

722
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:01,271
Let me know if you get
just a hint of bacon in there.

723
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,473
- Whoa. That's, uh--
- right?

724
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,142
- That's a lot of bacon.
- Oh, a lot of bacon.

725
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,278
- This is like a, um...

726
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,482
Some sort of like
a bacon... juice thing?

727
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,618
- That's beer. What do you mean?
- Beer?

728
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,388
- Yes, you dick.
I brew this beer.
- It's gray.

729
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,957
- Did you really not know
that this was beer?

730
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,127
- Can you carbonate it?
Is that part
of a different process?

731
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,628
- This is all great feedback.

732
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,997
- You want me to keep going?
- No, no, no.

733
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,166
I think I got your gist of it.

734
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,936
These girls are having a blast.

735
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,704
- What... what is it?

736
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,741
- They keep posting to insta.

737
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,978
- Well, Emily's certainly having
a blast. Who's that?

738
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,280
- I think they're just having
some drinks, man.

739
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:47,150
And if I know Kate,
she's super stoned by now.

740
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,918
That guy looks like a bartender.

741
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,587
They're having fun.

742
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,660
- Fun. She has this whole thing
about fucking fun.

743
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:01,831
We don't have... fun anymore,
like we never have fun.

744
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,535
- What do you think?
You think you guys are fun?

745
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:09,138
- Well, I mean, you know,
I'm pretty stressed out,

746
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,174
you know... generally, I guess.

747
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:14,344
- What?!
What are you talking about?

748
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,180
Don't say that about yourself.
- All right.

749
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:21,217
Well, look, I'm running, like,
11 different projects at work,

750
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,888
and on the phone,
dealing with like building codes

751
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,990
and contractors
and asshole clients

752
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,591
in like five states.

753
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,561
- That fucking blows.
- Yeah.

754
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:36,799
So, you know, when I get home,
i don't wanna deal with anyone.

755
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,003
- Right.
- And honestly,
neither does she.

756
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,071
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

757
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,009
It's not the high point
of our relationship.

758
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,744
- Yeah.

759
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:51,881
Look, man, I think that you guys
need to cut yourself a break

760
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,017
while you're still
in the trenches

761
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,052
and the kids are so young.

762
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:59,389
You know, try to just laugh
at some of the bullshit

763
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:02,759
and not be angry at each other,
like, all the time.

764
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,594
- So, like, lower the bar?

765
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,429
- Yeah. Like...

766
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,166
...just a bit.

767
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,102
- You're really lowering
the bar.

768
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,172
- Just keep it realistic.
- You can dig a hole
and put the bar in it.

769
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,041
- Not that...
Yeah, not that low.

770
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,611
- I need a lot of room, though,
because I tend to do this a lot.

771
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,279
- That's good.
- I just keep doing it,

772
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,481
and doing it and doing it.
- Just don't... okay.

773
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,687
- That's a gorgeous beer.

774
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,296
- You are so resourceful.

775
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,764
- Mm...

776
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,766
- I mean, our philosophy is,

777
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:47,437
if we can stay
pretty much into each other,

778
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,973
three or four months
out of the year

779
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,442
while keeping our kids alive,

780
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:55,378
teaching them to be
semi-decent human beings--

781
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,647
- right.
- --We're golden.

782
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,382
- Huh.

783
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,486
Now, those three or four months,
are they, like,

784
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:06,089
spread throughout the year,
or are those consecutive?

785
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:08,157
- Spread throughout the year.
- Okay.

786
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,994
- I'm getting so many likes
from my rose-budding post.

787
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,930
A lot of new friend requests,
too,

788
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,065
but weird ones like hard4buttz.

789
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,735
Buttking343,

790
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,570
assmeanything.

791
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,972
- Okay, Jamie,
let me see this post.

792
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:26,909
Okay. Do you know
what rose-budding is?

793
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,480
- When you throw the roses...
- Not exactly.

794
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,181
I think you should
take this post down

795
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:33,916
and don't accept any
of these friend request,

796
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,418
because these people
are not your friends.

797
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,921
- I'm so tired all the time.
We both are.

798
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,357
It sounds like a joke,
but it's not.

799
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,827
I literally can fall asleep
while I'm pooping on the toilet.

800
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,696
- Okay, well, this isn't a joke.

801
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,165
I would like you to teach me
how to do that.

802
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,501
- Okay. Well,
this is gonna sound weird.

803
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,336
I would love to.

804
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,705
- Oh, wait, wait.

805
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,107
It's my mother-in-law.

806
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,876
- Please don't answer
and kill this sweet buzz.

807
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:01,978
- Never.
- This is so fun.

808
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,047
- Oh, fuck, trust me.

809
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:08,017
- I love Halloween candy.
- Yeah, and you guys
stock up early, huh?

810
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,954
- Actually...

811
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:15,191
These are the kids'
from last year.

812
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,031
- One time, Theo, his mom and i
were sitting on the couch
watching a movie.

813
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,634
I was massaging Theo's back
and his shoulders,

814
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:27,503
and all of a sudden
i feel something.

815
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:31,474
It was his mom's hand.
She was rubbing his back, too.

816
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:34,744
We were both massaging him
at the same time.

817
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,979
- Oh, my god!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

818
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,414
- So awkward!
- Fucking sick!

819
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:41,551
What is it with mothers
and their sons?

820
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:43,352
- Check this out.

821
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,188
You see this?

822
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,424
I got this last Thanksgiving
fighting with my mother-in-law

823
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,827
over who was gonna make
the cranberry sauce.

824
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:55,231
That woman has got
lifeless eyes, black eyes,

825
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:58,601
American girl doll
Jess McConnell eyes.

826
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:01,704
- Oh!
- Jersey shore, 2002.

827
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,773
- Yeah?
- Andrew's mom stepped on me

828
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:07,043
with her old-lady jelly mules
trying to be the first

829
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,278
to lay out
his fucking beach towel.

830
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,914
- Okay, ladies,
here's what I figured out.
You're not gonna like this shit.

831
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,584
But we are all gonna end up
just like our mothers-in-laws.

832
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:16,853
- No fucking way.
- Mm-hmm.

833
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:20,890
Fucking way, fucking way.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna be
all over my William.

834
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:24,594
I can already tell, I can!
I love that kid so much!

835
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:27,196
Fuck his wife. I raised him,
i earned that shit.

836
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:29,632
- Yeah, well, try having four.
- Believe me.

837
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:33,069
- As far as I'm concerned,
they can move in with
their future wives anytime now.

838
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:36,139
- Oh, you think so?
You say that now,
but I'm gonna tell you,

839
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,107
mark my words,
we are all gonna be

840
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,742
inappropriately massaging
our grown sons.

841
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:42,645
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
- What?

842
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,614
Show me.

843
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:46,415
- Oh, god!!

844
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,084
- Jamie just looked up
rose-budding.

845
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:50,486
- Delete.
- That is fucking disgusting!

846
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:51,654
- It's an anus.

847
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,956
- Okay, tom.

848
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,459
I think I'm ready
to share something with you

849
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:58,761
that might just help
with that Emily situation.

850
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:03,266
It's a little trick that I call
"two cs a day."

851
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:05,468
Have you heard of that?

852
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,069
- No. What?

853
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,672
- Cs like compliments?

854
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,275
- So you give Kate
two compliments every day?

855
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:14,110
- That's right.

856
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:18,748
So, for example, I'll do one c
like straight out of the gate.

857
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,018
I'll do a c about usually her
physical appearance, you know.

858
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,487
Like, what she's wearing
or how she looks,

859
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,088
something like that.

860
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,125
But you wanna try to use
the words "beautiful,"

861
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:31,761
or "hot," or "sexy,"
something like that.

862
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:35,031
Don't ever say "nice"
or "pretty."
They don't like that.

863
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:38,434
Then later on in the day,
i try to follow up
with another c,

864
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,369
but this is more
of an appreciation c,

865
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:44,974
like: "How am I so lucky
to be in this with you?"

866
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,943
You know, but super Sincere.
The thing is,

867
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,378
I'm starting to feel
a little bit guilty about it,

868
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,448
because I'm now getting
so much out of it.

869
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,883
- Like blowjob?

870
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,952
- Yeah, like blowjobs.
- Really?

871
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:58,754
- Yeah,
while I'm watching kimmel.
- Whoa.

872
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,691
Where did you get this idea?

873
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:04,861
- We had a big fight
and she was, like:

874
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:07,697
"I don't feel like
you even appreciate me.

875
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:11,467
Why don't you say one nice thing
to me every single day?"

876
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:15,004
- Okay, all right.
So your big, like, genius plan

877
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:18,541
is something that your wife
told you to do?

878
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:22,545
- No, she said one a day,
i upped it to two.

879
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,650
- All right. Come clean, newbie.

880
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,852
- Whatever do you mean?

881
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:33,723
- Wow, clearly you were an extra
on cocktail, tom cruise.

882
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:36,826
- Close. I tended a bar,
summer of '99,

883
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,161
the yacht club
on lake Michigan.

884
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,530
- Wow.
- Our signature drink:

885
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,000
Summer on the shore. For you.

886
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,907
- That's a pretty good g&t.

887
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:53,743
You make this for your husband
when he comes walking
through the door?

888
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:56,679
- Not lately.

889
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,116
- Oh, excuse me.
- My god, not again.

890
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:01,617
God, I'm gonna kill them.

891
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,352
- Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

892
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,354
please direct your attention
to centre stage,

893
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:08,958
because, yes, it is that time:
Karaoke hour.

894
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,928
Karaoke hour!

895
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,663
- All right.

896
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,601
This one is for you...
And your friends.

897
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:20,603
Moms, you're on!

898
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:22,738
- Oh, shit.

899
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,807
- Oh!

900
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:26,375
- Fuck, yeah.

901
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,077
- Come on, you nailed it.

902
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,845
Let's go.

903
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,318
Whoo!

904
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,954
- Remember this?
- Very well.

905
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,057
We got this, we got this,
we got this.

906
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,814
- Jamie, come here!

907
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:07,350
- Mel, get up there, baby.

908
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,320
- Give me some English
so I can read this shit.

909
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,175
- But, yeah,
if I'm gonna get khakis,

910
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:35,111
I want them to be,
like, a nice tan--

911
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,545
- they have...
You can get them anywhere.

912
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,381
- Dad!
What are you doing out here?

913
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,316
- Hey, honey--
- can you guys
grab the door closed?

914
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,551
- Too late.

915
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,187
- We're hungry.

916
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,789
- Hey, let me grab
that spare key real quick.

917
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,191
- All right.
How was the movie, guys?

918
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,293
- It was awesome.
- It was okay.

919
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,696
- Nope, this is not it. Dammit.
- What?

920
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:56,132
Fuck. That's real poop.
That's not fake.

921
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,968
So what are you saying,
that we're locked out?

922
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,706
- Yeah, tom, we're locked out,
but what's more important
is we don't own a dog.

923
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,841
- Okay.
- Sam, did you do this?

924
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:07,676
Gross.

925
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,545
- Okay.
- Right?
- Yeah.

926
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,181
- Come on!
Where's a fake piece of poop
when you need it?

927
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,883
- Dude, this is not good.

928
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:16,552
So you're saying
that we're actually locked out,

929
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,087
like for sure?

930
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,756
- Tom, calm down.
It's gonna be fine, all right?

931
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,225
I'm pretty good in a crisis.
Watch this.

932
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,430
Guys! Guys!!!

933
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:30,099
Oh, no!!
Oh, no, we're locked out!!

934
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:33,202
We're locked out!!
What are we gonna do?!

935
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,105
Well, your dad and i
are gonna protect you, okay?!

936
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,007
So don't worry, don't worry!

937
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:41,844
The bad news is,
we're locked out
until mom gets home!

938
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,979
Oh, but the good news is...

939
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,116
...we got candy.

940
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:49,385
Yay!!
- Lots of candy!

941
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,092
- Okay, guys,
this is my second move.
It's called the "oh, no, Romeo."

942
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,761
I'm not on the dance floor.
I'm grinding with my girls.

943
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:00,563
I'm doing my thing. I look good.

944
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:04,400
He comes up behind me,
he wraps his arms around me.

945
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:07,603
I say, "oh, no Romeo!
Stop, elbow, go!"

946
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,706
- Oh, no, Romeo!
Pow!

947
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:16,378
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

948
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,380
- Oh! Hey.

949
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,949
All right.

950
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:21,584
I'm good.
- Are you okay?

951
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:23,419
- I'm good. This...
- I'm sorry about that.

952
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,788
- Oh, you don't have
nothing to be sorry about.

953
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,590
That felt good in a way.

954
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,892
- That's the "oh, no, Romeo."
Yeah.

955
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,962
- So where are you taking me?

956
00:50:32,964 --> 00:50:34,797
- Truth?
- Please.

957
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:36,799
- Good to get outside sometimes.

958
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:41,170
Get away from the bar,
get some fresh air. You know...

959
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,606
- It's really a nice night.

960
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,808
Good breeze.

961
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,409
- You're very cute,

962
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,179
you're very funny,
and you're very smart.

963
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:53,149
And I'll have you know,
i take my breaks very seriously.

964
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:56,118
But I had a feeling about you
and I'm just happy

965
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,053
that you came out with me
tonight.

966
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,191
And I apologize in advance
for this.

967
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:05,461
This is a disgusting,
terrible habit.

968
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:08,030
Don't judge me.
- Oh, god, are you kidding me?

969
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,366
No. Before kids,

970
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:13,369
a cigarette,
and a glass of wine at night
was, like...

971
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:16,105
- Look, we can relive
your old glory days right now.

972
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:18,007
Nobody's watching.
We're out here by ourselves.

973
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,642
I won't tell.

974
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,844
- Oh, god.

975
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,345
I shouldn't.

976
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,648
It's been years.

977
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,950
- Yeah, you're probably right.
It's not a great look
to be smoking a cigarette

978
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,952
and pushing a stroller
down the street.

979
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:32,855
Although it's kind of sexy
in like a fucked-up '70s
kind of way.

980
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:35,224
- You're funny.

981
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:38,227
- Ooh, you don't have a lighter
by chance, do you?

982
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,963
- Do I have a lighter?
- Oh, you know what?

983
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,365
That's a dumb question.
Of course you don't.

984
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:46,135
- So... what about you?
Do you have any kids?

985
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:48,037
Ever been married?

986
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,672
- Nah.

987
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:52,875
I came close... to both,

988
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:55,911
but I just think the lifestyle
i was leading in the bar,

989
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,013
and, you know,
all the things going on,

990
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:01,016
it was just never
very conducive to any of that.

991
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:03,686
But enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

992
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:05,888
Emily, the bartending lawyer,

993
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,490
who's been married
for how many years?

994
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,492
- Truth?

995
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,061
- Truth.

996
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:14,763
- I have been with my husband
since college.

997
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,067
It's boring and predictable,
right?

998
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:19,902
- Uh, no.

999
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,071
If boring and predictable
is your thing,

1000
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:24,073
then you're... killing it.

1001
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,044
See, it's not so bad. You get
to spend some quality time

1002
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,847
with a nightlife entrepreneur,
who's actually
kind of a great guy.

1003
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,916
- I get it.
Your name's on your napkins.

1004
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:35,584
- Is that a fresh tone?

1005
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,519
This is me.
I'm gonna get a lighter.

1006
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,154
- Oh.
- I'll be back.

1007
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,162
- Get out, get out,
get out, get out.

1008
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:50,199
Ooh.

1009
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:53,902
- This is pretty weird
that we're all laying
in the car together.

1010
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,039
- Yeah.
But it's kind of fun too, right?

1011
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,541
- It's... unexpected.

1012
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:04,113
- Where did you learn
that word?

1013
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:06,548
- From mommy.
It's the word of the day.

1014
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,318
- Oh, mommy has a word
of the day, huh?

1015
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,256
- Daddy, I'm cold and it smells
like Wyatt's poop in here.

1016
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:16,759
- Oh, wow.

1017
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:19,261
Is that
what that terrible smell is?

1018
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:22,331
- No, I thought it was Andrew.

1019
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,199
- You're funny.
- Am I?

1020
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,638
Hey, hon.

1021
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,975
I'm sorry.

1022
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:35,911
You know, it's my fault
that we are stuck out here,

1023
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,580
and I know
this is not the kind of thing

1024
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,215
that would happen
on mommy's watch.

1025
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:44,053
She's pretty good
at this stuff, huh?

1026
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:50,559
- I like it
when you're the mommy too
sometimes, daddy.

1027
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,307
- Whoo!!

1028
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,776
- Thank you so much.

1029
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,398
I'll go check.

1030
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:36,171
You, I like you.
Get on up here, short-stuff!

1031
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,841
Your dreams
are about to come true!

1032
00:54:43,214 --> 00:54:46,315
- Luke's gone too.
- What?!

1033
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:54,089
Have you seen
where Emily went?
- No.

1034
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:04,066
I'm gonna do
a quick perimeter check.

1035
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,008
- Excuse me, where's Luke?
He was here with my friend
all night. Where'd they go?

1036
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,410
- They left like 20 minutes ago.

1037
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,245
I mean, he said he'd be back,
though.

1038
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:18,881
But, you know, he did check
to make sure I was closing up.

1039
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:20,749
So they're probably...

1040
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,519
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
This does not,
not seem like her.

1041
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,054
She would tell me
if she was leaving.
Where'd they go?

1042
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,357
- He didn't say.
- I'm gonna...
I'm gonna text her.

1043
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:30,426
- I feel like something's wrong.

1044
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:32,428
- You felt like
something's wrong all night.
It's gonna be okay.

1045
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,097
- She's not responding.
I feel like something's wrong
too now.

1046
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,199
- What's your name?
- Alfred.

1047
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,268
- Okay, I'm Melanie.
I'd like you to tell me
about your friend, Luke.

1048
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,137
Is this a regular thing he does,
leaving the bar
with a lady friend?

1049
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,539
- He's done it
a few times before.

1050
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,040
- Great.
You're doing a great job.

1051
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,075
Cooperation's really key here.
- Thank you.

1052
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,311
- I'd like you
to go in your purse,
grab your phone, call Luke,

1053
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:51,747
have him bring Emily back
right now. Can you do that?

1054
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:54,650
- I can't.
- You can't?
- He's scary. I can't.

1055
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,984
- You don't know me, do you?
- No.

1056
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:58,120
- Jamie here knows me.
- Hi, Jamie.

1057
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,255
- Jamie tell al what I'm like
when I'm mad.
- Call your boss, Alfred.

1058
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:02,658
- I think you'd like
to call your boss, okay?

1059
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,061
Because you can cooperate,
or I can have the atf here
first thing in the morning

1060
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:07,663
investigating you serving
all these minors.

1061
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:09,465
- We don't serve minors here.
- Oh, is that right?

1062
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,900
- No.
- Looks like a Katy Perry
meet-and-greet to me.

1063
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,802
They will shut
this fucking place down

1064
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,170
while they investigate
the charge.

1065
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,339
You think Luke
is gonna like that?

1066
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,575
- What are you, a cop?
- You wanna fucking find out,
motherfucker?

1067
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,243
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1068
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,512
Okay, get on that fucking phone.
- Fuck you.

1069
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,117
- Okay, I'll be back.
Are we 100% sure
this is trouble?

1070
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,919
I mean,
they were flirting all night.

1071
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,688
- I am telling you,
i know Emily.

1072
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,990
- Wait! I think I can track
her iPhone!

1073
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,292
I've been setting instagram up
for her earlier.

1074
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,294
Let me check. Give me a second.
- Oh, my god.

1075
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,330
Are you telling me you can track
somebody else's phone?

1076
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:44,366
- Yes, I can pretty much do
anything on one of these.
- Oh, yes!

1077
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,502
- Well?
- Nope, no answer.
- Well, where does he live?

1078
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:49,171
- I can't tell you.
- Where the fuck does he live?!
- I can't say!!!

1079
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,440
- Forget about it. I have
a read on where they are.

1080
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:53,609
They're on flanders Avenue
heading south.

1081
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:56,144
- Okay, ladies,
this is really happening.
We're moving out. Let's go.

1082
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,147
- Let's go, let's go!
- But wait!
Our cars are at the restaurant.

1083
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:02,451
- Um... I can drive you guys.

1084
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:06,788
I've had nothing but five
coconut waters tonight, so...

1085
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,224
I'm Barry, by the way.
- I'm Jamie.

1086
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:12,327
- Yeah, I don't think
we really got to introduce
ourselves officially, so hello.

1087
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,162
- Let's go! Let's move!

1088
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,902
- Okay, I got a read.
Now she is off of flanders,

1089
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:23,138
and she is on to cabot,
heading west on cabot.

1090
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,474
- Should we call tom?
- No, no, no, do not call tom.

1091
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:28,076
We don't know
what we're dealing with yet.

1092
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,713
- Oh, guys, you don't know her.
She would not just fucking
run off with some strange guy.

1093
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:34,516
- Kate, I hate to say it,
but they seemed
pretty into each other.

1094
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:36,385
- I got her.
She just went left on pacific.

1095
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:39,021
It looks like they're heading
to the Marina district.

1096
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:41,890
- Okey-dokey.
- Oh, I'm trying her again.

1097
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,392
Come on.

1098
00:57:43,394 --> 00:57:46,828
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1099
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,364
-<i> Leave me the fuck alone</i>
<i> already!</i>

1100
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:51,567
- What?
- That was not her.

1101
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:54,002
- Fuck, was that her?
- No, no, no. Try her again.

1102
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,104
- The signal stopped
at the Marina.

1103
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,508
- Okay, we're tracking her,
we're closing in,

1104
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,377
and we're gonna get out
of whatever situation she's in.

1105
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:05,547
Are you cool? Are you cool?
You're cool, right? You're cool?

1106
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:07,449
Barry, you need
to move this motherfucker!

1107
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,218
I've been in golf carts
faster than this! Let's go!

1108
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,788
- I'm sorry,
my foot is cramping up!
I haven't had a banana today.

1109
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,758
- A white Van. Everybody knows
the only people that drive
white vans are serial killers.

1110
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,628
- One second, one second,
just got to adjust here.
I'm sorry.

1111
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,463
- Wait, no,
this is not the time.

1112
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:23,599
- No, I can just--
- oh, oh, my god!

1113
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,434
Barry, just park
the fucking car, man!

1114
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:27,869
- I know, I know.
It's disrespectful
to other drivers--

1115
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,205
- nobody's here!
Emily?!

1116
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,074
Emily?!

1117
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,642
Oh, shit.

1118
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:35,444
- Emily!

1119
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:37,446
- Emily?
- Oh, my god.

1120
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:39,081
- Emily?

1121
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,885
- Jesus h. Christ.

1122
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,955
Is that fucker
taking her out in the water?

1123
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:50,092
No, I really don't like this.
- Oh, no, no.

1124
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:54,296
- It's zero dark 30.
Zero dark fucking 30.

1125
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,531
Mission is a go.

1126
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,952
Holy shit.

1127
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,528
- That woman is certifiable.

1128
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,197
- I got you, motherfucker!

1129
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,932
- No.

1130
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,135
She's incredible.

1131
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,337
She's got our six.

1132
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,572
She's saving my friend.

1133
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:41,576
Wait.

1134
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,280
My friend.

1135
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,191
- Unbelievable! Here!

1136
00:59:56,193 --> 01:00:00,062
- Oh!
- Grab on! You can do it!

1137
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:03,231
Come on, I got you!

1138
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,368
I got you, come on.
Come on, come on.

1139
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,306
- Holy shit.

1140
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,141
It's fucking freezing.

1141
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:16,178
- You are one gutsy bitch.
- Oh, no.

1142
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,880
- I wish you'd consider
co-chairing the spring auction
with me.

1143
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:21,883
- Well, can we do this later?
We need to find Emily.
- Okay.

1144
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:24,886
- Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Huh?

1145
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:28,256
- Looks like I might've
targeted the wrong vessel.

1146
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,659
- You think?

1147
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:35,464
- Let's get out of here.
Come on. Shit.

1148
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,411
- God, it feels so good...

1149
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:53,148
Just to be the old me
for a few hours.

1150
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:57,018
You know, not, like...

1151
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,187
Mommy or...

1152
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:00,789
Anything.

1153
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,425
Just... Emily.

1154
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:04,860
- Hmm.

1155
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,063
I'm a huge fan...

1156
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:09,798
Of just Emily.

1157
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1158
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,313
- Oh, I... I can't. I'm sorry.

1159
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,618
It was so fun at the bar,

1160
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,821
and... and it has been
a really long time

1161
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,323
since anyone
has kissed me like that,

1162
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:38,627
but my... I mean...
I'm married, I am married,

1163
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:42,464
I am super married and... ew.

1164
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,233
I'm sorry. Oh, god.

1165
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:46,835
Where am I?
- Hey. Hey, hey.

1166
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:49,070
- What?
- You didn't do anything wrong.

1167
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,139
- What? I kissed you.

1168
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,341
- I kissed you.
- I kissed you back.

1169
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,411
I'm so sorry.

1170
01:01:56,413 --> 01:02:00,081
- For what, stopping?
It was going very well.

1171
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,983
- That's funny.
- Look.

1172
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,353
I've been a wake-up call
for a few married women
in my life.

1173
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,656
It's not... it's not the end
of the world.

1174
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:10,325
- I got to go, I got to go.
My friends and...

1175
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,260
I have to wake up
in the morning,

1176
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,963
because it's a school morning,
so I got to go.
- Hey.

1177
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:16,865
- What?
- Okay.

1178
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:19,901
But you should kiss
your husband like that,
by the way.

1179
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,140
- So you see anything out there?
- Sort of,

1180
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:28,376
but it's so dark now that I feel
like I've lost sight of them.

1181
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:29,878
- Yeah.

1182
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:35,984
I'm not worried,
i think you're friend
probably has Luke, like,

1183
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:38,687
hog-tied and begging
for mercy by now.

1184
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,889
- Oh, yeah? Well, let's hope so.

1185
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:44,526
- I got to say, uh,
you ladies are something else,

1186
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:47,829
I love it. It's very cool.
- Thanks.

1187
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,465
- So you're all... married,
then?

1188
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:53,468
- Oh, well, they are.
I'm not. I'm divorced.

1189
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,136
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

1190
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,839
- I mean... I'm sorry.

1191
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,141
That's too bad. Or... is it?

1192
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,477
I mean, is it too bad?

1193
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:05,580
- No, it's certainly better
than being married to my ex,
that's for sure.

1194
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:07,482
- Right, yeah, good.
Well, that's good.

1195
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,718
- Not bad.
- I mean, that you're happier.

1196
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,820
- Right.
- That's good. Yes, yes, yes.

1197
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:13,922
- I would say
I'm definitely happier.

1198
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,757
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1199
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,863
- So what about you?
Are you in a relationship or...?

1200
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:25,200
- No, not right now.
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

1201
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:28,169
- So how did you get stuck being
the designated driver tonight?

1202
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,238
- Oh, I volunteered.
- You did?

1203
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,575
- Yeah, yeah.
I don't like drinking too much.

1204
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,278
It makes me feel all weird
in my head, you know.

1205
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,013
Are you cold?
- Oh.

1206
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,516
- A little chilly there.
- Oh, thank you.

1207
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,818
- Here.
- - It's cold. Thank you.

1208
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,964
- Well, Melanie?
- What?

1209
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,767
- I'm waiting.
- Waiting for what?

1210
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:04,205
- Jaws jokes. On land tonight,
out here, you got nothing.

1211
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,907
- Oh, you're right.

1212
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:08,410
Shit. Oh, shit.

1213
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:10,211
Come on. Come on.

1214
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,213
- Oh...

1215
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,620
I have never felt so sober
in my entire life.

1216
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:22,223
- Correct. Let's go look and see
if we can find Jamie and Barry,

1217
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,960
and more luck than we did.
Come on.

1218
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:27,629
Come on. Come on.

1219
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,431
- Whenever.
- Okay.

1220
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:31,599
Come on, come on.

1221
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:36,805
- I love peanuts so, like,
a peanut beer, is that a thing?

1222
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:39,808
- Fuck, yes.
- Yeah? It's a peanut.
- Great idea.

1223
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,643
Take that one step further.

1224
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:46,247
What if it's like a whole line
of, like, stadium flavours?

1225
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,249
- Right.
- I.E.: Peanuts,

1226
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,652
hotdogs, pretzels.

1227
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:52,654
- Mustard beer.

1228
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:54,589
- Why aren't we writing this
down?

1229
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,891
- I don't know. 'Cause...
You know what?

1230
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:01,096
- All right, someone tooted.

1231
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,433
- Yeah, it was probably
all of them.

1232
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,669
- How dare you fart on me?

1233
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:09,537
- When my kids fart...

1234
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,475
- Don't even finish
the sentence.

1235
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:17,679
- Dude, dude, dude, dude,
i... love... it.

1236
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,117
- What do you binge on?
- Oh, I don't know.

1237
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,519
I try to watch what I eat,
watch my weight so...

1238
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,889
- Oh, no, I mean, like,
like, binge watch.

1239
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:29,858
Like netflix? Amazon?

1240
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,060
- Oh, yeah. Uh, duh.

1241
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:36,531
No, I, um, I don't really do
any of that stuff.

1242
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:39,834
I'm more of a regular
cable-TV guy.

1243
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:42,037
- Oh, I love regular cable TV.
- Yeah?

1244
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,873
- As a matter of fact,
this is so embarrassing,

1245
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:47,075
but I actually fall asleep
watching hgtv.

1246
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:49,177
- Oh, my god, me too.

1247
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:50,879
Almost, like, every night,

1248
01:05:50,881 --> 01:05:53,381
I fall asleep watching
love it or list it.

1249
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:55,083
- I love that show!
- Yeah?

1250
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:57,519
- Ever noticed how
they always choose to love it?

1251
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,254
- Yes!
- Always.

1252
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:01,022
- Every time.
- They always choose to love it.
- I know.

1253
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:03,258
I think they're gonna list it,
and then they love it,

1254
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,560
then sometimes I'm, like:
"They're making us think
they love it,

1255
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:08,096
so they actually list it,
but then they just love it."

1256
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,934
- I think you're an old soul,
Barry.

1257
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,537
- Old soul? Aw.

1258
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:18,073
I like that. That's nice.

1259
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:21,242
The last girl I dated told me

1260
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:24,446
I reminded her
of a bashful predator.

1261
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:34,189
- Where are all of my friends?
- They are looking for you.

1262
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:38,126
They actually went bonkers.
Uh, they thought Luke
had abducted you or something.

1263
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,195
- What?
- Yeah.

1264
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,764
- Don't worry about it.

1265
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:45,266
I'm... listen, I'm sure
they'll be back soon.

1266
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:47,102
Just hang out here
for a little bit.

1267
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:50,438
- No, I got to...
I got to call Kate.

1268
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,006
Just... okay.
Except for...

1269
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,811
I don't have my phone.
It's gone.

1270
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:59,314
- Use my phone. Use my phone.

1271
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,416
I don't want any trouble.
Just take the phone.

1272
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:03,952
- Um... I don't know
her phone number.
It's in my phone.

1273
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:05,820
- You don't know
your friend's number?

1274
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,790
- No, I don't know
my friend's number!
It's in my phone!

1275
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,758
- Truly,
just trying to be helpful.

1276
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,927
- Who knows anybody's
phone number anymore?
Fuck technology.

1277
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:15,330
- Oh, my god.
Guys, I can just call Barry.

1278
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,732
- Who's Barry?
- Who are you?

1279
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,167
- Barry is my buddy,

1280
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,970
and he took all your friends
looking for you.

1281
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:25,874
- Looking for me where?
- You know what?
They were tracking your phone.

1282
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:29,477
- I don't have my phone.

1283
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:30,979
Fuck.

1284
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,417
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1285
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,987
Are you kidding me
with that phone?

1286
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:41,489
- What?
Hello, it's Barry.

1287
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:45,193
Really? Emily's at the bar.
- What?

1288
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,628
- Yeah.
- Can I talk...?

1289
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,096
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hello?

1290
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,103
- It's go time.

1291
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,071
- I'm right behind you.

1292
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,642
- Nice aft.
- Oh, god.

1293
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:03,711
If she came here willingly,
I'll fucking kill her.

1294
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,019
- Emily!
- Jamie!

1295
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:13,388
- Ah... oh, my god,
we were so worried.

1296
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,790
They still haven't come back.
- What the fuck?

1297
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,459
Oh, you guys better get help.
This is bad.

1298
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,396
- Well, there's got to be
Marina security.
They'll call in whoever to help.

1299
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:23,965
- That's a good idea.
Okay, you go do that.
- All right.

1300
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:25,667
- Jamie.
- What?
- Look at me.

1301
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,036
Where was the last place
that you saw them?

1302
01:08:28,038 --> 01:08:31,172
- Down there.
- Take me.
- Okay, come on, let's go.

1303
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,545
- Okay,
where the fuck is Emily?!

1304
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,550
- Hey, get off my boat.
- Your boat? Excuse me, Matey,

1305
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:45,220
but I'm gonna have to see
your license and registration.

1306
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,855
- Uh, Mel, let's just go.
Emily's not here.

1307
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:51,492
- It's my dad's boat,
but I'm gonna need you
to leave.

1308
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,695
- Bae, be nice.

1309
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:55,830
They're homeless.

1310
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,699
- We are not homeless.

1311
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,168
- You must be hungry.
- I'm actually pretty hungry.

1312
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,337
- Okay, now's not the time.
All right.

1313
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,505
Somebody tell me
what's going on here.

1314
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,275
- It's senior skip tomorrow,
so we're having a party.

1315
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:09,677
- This is a party?
Don't bullshit me.

1316
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,846
- Oh, my god!
- There you are!

1317
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,348
- Emily!!!

1318
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,683
- We saw your unicorn
hanging over the side!

1319
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,752
- Where the fuck have you been?!

1320
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:21,856
- Uh, James,
what are all these old-ass milfs
doing on the boat? Ah!

1321
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,627
What the fuck?

1322
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:29,230
- Oh! Wait a minute.
It's here. Your phone is here.

1323
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:32,066
Did you hear that, that ping?
Here, look.

1324
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:33,901
- Were these kids at Luke's?

1325
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,536
- Give me that bag.

1326
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,238
- That's... a coincidence.

1327
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,140
- Gimme that bag.
- No--
- gimme that bag.

1328
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,409
Gimme your bag.
Give Melanie your bag!

1329
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,378
- Stop, stop!

1330
01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:46,814
- What is this?

1331
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:49,450
All right, was is this,
some kind of bling-ring shit?

1332
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,653
It's that what you guys
are doing here, huh?

1333
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,621
Taking phones and sell them
on the black market?

1334
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:55,223
Is that what you're doing?
- Oh, yeah.

1335
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:57,425
Yep, I've seen this on dateline.

1336
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:01,663
- So what? Zoe lifts shit.
That's her thing.
Everybody has a thing.

1337
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:04,399
- I catfish rich dudes.
- I pull fire alarms.

1338
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:07,235
- I'm a YouTube unboxer.
- What the fuck is that?

1339
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,437
- Okay, all right,
i steal things.

1340
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,306
Sorry, I can't help myself.

1341
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,107
Please don't turn me in.

1342
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:18,313
- So we're not gonna
call the cops,
'cause we're cool as shit,

1343
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:21,582
but you're all gonna
pay the price
for Zoe's shenanigans tonight.

1344
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,618
You'll survive, Jamie.

1345
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,588
Now... you're all gonna be
technology-free
for the next hour.

1346
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,157
Let's cut
this electronica bullshit

1347
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,759
and get some peabo Bryson
up in here.

1348
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,999
- Five minutes.

1349
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,734
Yeah, right.

1350
01:10:42,604 --> 01:10:45,606
- Okay. Now,
you're all gonna deal with
the extreme social awkwardness

1351
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,609
that we had to deal at parties
back in the day.

1352
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,012
You ready for that?
Here I come.

1353
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:53,548
All right,
you're gonna face each other,

1354
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,817
in the flesh, without a phone,

1355
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:00,455
to filter out any of those oily
little teenage pores you got.

1356
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:02,023
- Whoo!

1357
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:05,660
You're welcome.

1358
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:30,885
-<i> I've got one.</i>

1359
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:34,989
Never have I ever walked in
on my parents doing it.

1360
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,058
- Dude.
- Oh.
- Nasty.

1361
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:40,428
- Okay, ready?

1362
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,864
Never have I ever had lice.

1363
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:44,699
- What?
- Ew.

1364
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,234
- Ew!
- Emily, I promise you,

1365
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:48,870
just give it a few more weeks
at happy days,

1366
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:50,938
and you won't be borrowing
my special comb.

1367
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,342
- No!
- I can't believe
you've never had lice.

1368
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:57,245
- I'm so never having kids.
- Good luck.

1369
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,247
- This is fun.

1370
01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:01,883
- I think we freaked them out.

1371
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:03,851
- Good. Little fuckers.

1372
01:12:05,687 --> 01:12:08,956
- Never have I ever cheated
on my husband

1373
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,959
with an old boyfriend
from high school.

1374
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:18,132
- How did I not know?
I thought it was Theo.

1375
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:20,902
- Yeah. I know.
That's what everybody thought.

1376
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:23,337
It's because I only post
the pretty stuff.

1377
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,340
- You're the pretty stuff.

1378
01:12:29,711 --> 01:12:33,915
- Never have I ever...
Kissed another guy...

1379
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:36,484
While I was married.

1380
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,219
- Emily.
- Whoa.

1381
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:39,921
- I stopped it immediately.
I did.

1382
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:43,090
It was a mista...
It was such a mistake.

1383
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:46,294
I am... I'm telling tom...
When I get home.

1384
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:48,129
- Are you sure?

1385
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:49,664
I'm terrified,

1386
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:52,099
but I think...

1387
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,069
I realized tonight
that I want my marriage to work.

1388
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:57,171
I want it to work with tom.

1389
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:02,477
- You just have to fight for it,
sweetie pie. You know?

1390
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,813
- All right.

1391
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:10,618
Never have I ever dressed up
my husband's dick as Napoleon.

1392
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,020
- Whoa, wait a minute. What?!

1393
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:16,757
- Okay, you guys, remember,
like, when we went on
that Alaskan cruise last year?

1394
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,292
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we didn't.

1395
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:20,795
We went to this sex retreat,
to reconnect.

1396
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,463
- Really?
- Wow. Did it work?

1397
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:25,166
- Yes, it worked.
- - Yeah, obviously.

1398
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:27,935
- Yeah. We dressed up his dick
as Napoleon,

1399
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,338
and he did a little one-act.

1400
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:33,541
It was really very good,
critically acclaimed.

1401
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:35,343
- Whoa.

1402
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:37,211
- Anyway, yeah.

1403
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:39,447
And we still do it,
and I love it.

1404
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,449
- That's a really good one.
- It sure is.

1405
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:44,051
- All right,
never have I ever...

1406
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,625
...had real mom friends.

1407
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,996
- Come here, give me a hug.

1408
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:57,198
Come on, give me a hug.
Come here.

1409
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,567
- I want in. Come here.
- Me too!

1410
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,374
You guys are still wet.

1411
01:14:06,376 --> 01:14:08,209
Aren't you freezing?
- Yeah.

1412
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:10,077
- A little bit.

1413
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,414
- Oh, I'm so glad Emily and i
didn't have to go in the water.

1414
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:17,451
- Hmm.

1415
01:15:44,906 --> 01:15:47,608
- Ow! Ow.
- God, if I ever do this again,

1416
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:49,443
I'm getting
a goddamn epidural first.

1417
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:51,912
- The CIA should use this shit
on terrorists.

1418
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:55,149
- Oh, god, you guys
are all a bunch of wimps.

1419
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,418
- It's very delicate tissue
down there, Jamie.

1420
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,687
You know, I'm already
regretting my choice.

1421
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,522
Should I have gone
with the mt. Rushmore?

1422
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:03,157
Peter loves history.
- Are you kidding me?

1423
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,259
He's gonna love that.
It was the best one.

1424
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:07,261
- Hey, em.

1425
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:09,463
Turn around.

1426
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:10,998
- What?
- Just...

1427
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,600
Turn around.

1428
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,280
- Me?

1429
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:28,449
- Yeah, you.

1430
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:32,286
- You did this. It's you.
- No! I swear.

1431
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:34,522
It's all tom.
- Come on, get over there, go!

1432
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:36,524
- Go get your Jake Ryan.

1433
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:39,360
Go! Go get your Jake Ryan!

1434
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:41,729
- Whoo!

1435
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,198
- Tom looks kind of hot.

1436
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:57,378
I guess the talk worked.

1437
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,753
He's even got the sweater,
you guys.

1438
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:12,393
- Uh-oh.
- She's coming back.

1439
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,261
- But she looks okay.

1440
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,996
What happened?

1441
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,599
- Well, tom said
he didn't want me
to miss our dinner,

1442
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:20,534
so I'm gonna meet up with him
later.

1443
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:22,603
- Shit.

1444
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,108
- The Porsche is ours
for the night.

1445
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,943
- Really?
- That is a slick move.

1446
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:31,178
Nice work, tom!
- Thank you, tom!
- Wow.

1447
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,881
- Are you sure? There'll be
other fun mom dinners.

1448
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:36,016
- You got that right, bitches.
Come on.

1449
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,685
- Let's go.
- Let's go. We're good.
