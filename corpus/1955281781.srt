1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:05,005
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:33,367
(heavy breathing)

3
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:45,479
I'd say another year,
this is all desert, dirty.

4
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,656
What's this?

5
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,259
Oh my!

6
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,229
Oh, my lucky stars!

7
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:06,367
He has been looking
for you. (Laughing)

8
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,385
(electric zapping)
(bubbling liquid)

9
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:34,595
My payment, and don't be stingy.

10
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,964
(whimpering)

11
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,167
Good, good.

12
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,735
Fresh.

13
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:00,821
Flesh for flesh, fallen
angel, demon jester,

14
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,828
master of disgrace, Killjoy,

15
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,566
the "I" incarnate.

16
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:20,241
(dramatic music)

17
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,679
(laughing)

18
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,981
Oh, oh!
(bones cracking)

19
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,988
Why have you
summoned me, maggot?

20
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,891
(laughing)

21
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,729
I didn't summon you.

22
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,901
(dramatic music)

23
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,410
(laughing)

24
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,145
This is awkward.

25
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:11,892
(electric zapping)
(screaming)

26
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,467
[Monitor] How do you plead?

27
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,168
How do I plead?

28
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,671
What the fuck do you
mean how do I plead?

29
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,039
This is your arraignment.

30
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,641
Arraignment?

31
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,544
I'm on trial? (Laughing)

32
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,713
What court could try me?

33
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,149
Don't you know who I am?

34
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,851
Who are you?

35
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:43,491
(electric zapping)
(screaming)

36
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,467
How do you plead,
innocent or guilty?

37
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:56,837
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:01,842
I'm Killjoy, I'm guilty
as hell! (Laughing)

39
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:08,482
(electric zapping)
(screaming)

40
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:17,958
(intense music)

41
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:19,206
(Sandie laughing)

42
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,075
All still missing.

43
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:28,148
(Sandie laughing)

44
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,021
But we found a hell of a lot
of Zilla's blood on the carpet.

45
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,422
And on you.

46
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,992
(Sandie laughing)

47
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,227
Do you think that's funny?

48
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,096
It isn't that simple.

49
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,299
Three years ago, I was the
first officer on the scene,

50
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,802
when I showed up, she was
covered in Zilla's blood.

51
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,139
DNA also shows splatter
of her boyfriend's blood.

52
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,541
[Ericson] Calm down, Grimley.

53
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,676
We know she did it,
and she just laughs.

54
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,711
It isn't that
simple, detective.

55
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,813
Look, is this an interrogation?

56
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,281
[Ericson] No.

57
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,716
[Simmons] Do I need to
get a lawyer for my patient?

58
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,452
No, no, we just need to
ask her a few questions.

59
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,721
We want to find the rest
of the students' bodies

60
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,557
so their families can
have some closure.

61
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,092
Look at her, no remorse.

62
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,827
Detective, please.

63
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,598
I don't think you really
understand what's going on here.

64
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,572
I still want to
talk to her, alone.

65
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,608
Just a moment, I've
got to show you this.

66
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,583
This is a normal brain,
of someone laughing.

67
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,319
And this, is your
suspect, my patient.

68
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:42,055
It's similar to
the laughing one.

69
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,891
So that's when
she laughs, so what?

70
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,828
No, this is her brain all
the time, even when she sleeps.

71
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,030
There's constant
neural activity,

72
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,765
that's similar to
that of laughter,

73
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,466
in appearance, anyway.

74
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,268
It's like that all the time.

75
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,403
Every second.

76
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,005
Is this your defense?

77
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,239
You don't think she could do it

78
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,041
because she's got a
case of the giggles?

79
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:05,245
It's not my job to defend,
but to treat my patient.

80
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:09,282
Listen, I don't know if Sandie
killed those kids or not,

81
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,385
but I can't imagine anyone
being functional in this state.

82
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,121
She's a mental invalid.

83
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,790
Doc, what could do
something like this?

84
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,394
I don't know, my first
thought was a tumor, then drugs.

85
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,764
But her brain is
clean, she's clean.

86
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,700
Except for the shitstorm in
her noggin, she's normal.

87
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,302
That doesn't
answer the question.

88
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,773
I don't have an answer
for you, I don't know.

89
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,374
[Grimley] Doesn't
goddamn matter.

90
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,977
She was found mentally
unfit to stand trial.

91
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,847
The perp got away with
murder by reason of insanity.

92
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,650
But I don't think she wants
to get away with anything.

93
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,787
Sandie waived her right to
doctor-patient confidentiality.

94
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,056
She wants you to talk to me.

95
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,058
She wants to talk to you.

96
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:02,703
(Sandie laughing)

97
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,016
[Ericson] Just relax I'm not
gonna ask about your friends.

98
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,319
You see, my colleagues don't
think it pertains to the case.

99
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,553
But I'm fascinated.

100
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,290
You could say this thing
I wanna ask you about

101
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,192
has become my new obsession.

102
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,295
At the scene of the crime,

103
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,097
we found a large
amount of material.

104
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,234
Mostly crazy lists of
names, all ancient-sounding,

105
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,136
like something out
of a comic book.

106
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,806
You see I've taken up the
reading through that pile,

107
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,441
the professor's notes,
his computer files,

108
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,344
even his publications
going 10 years back.

109
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,681
I thought, maybe I'll
be able to find a clue.

110
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,582
(Sandie laughing)

111
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,652
I'm no expert, but after
a while I begin to feel

112
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,889
that all these names
belong to one demon.

113
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,359
One name stuck out
like a sore thumb.

114
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,863
One name didn't fit because
it just didn't sound old.

115
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,298
And I tell you what.

116
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,968
I heard it before,
when I was a kid.

117
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,772
I thought it was just an urban
legend in the neighborhood.

118
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,441
Shocked the shit
out of me when it

119
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,176
now turned up in the
professor's notes.

120
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,748
Sandie, look at me.

121
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,753
What could you tell
me about Killjoy?

122
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,425
(Sandie laughing)

123
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,137
(intense music)

124
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,572
Wait, wait a
second, where are we?

125
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,341
What happened to my hair,
who the hell are you?

126
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,577
I'm the bailiff.

127
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,480
[Killjoy] What? Whoa!

128
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,963
(elevator music)

129
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,598
Hey, big guy.

130
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,402
Hey, mister bailiff,
where are we going?

131
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,671
We're going down.

132
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:26,279
(suspenseful music)

133
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,452
Look, how long is this
gonna take, exactly?

134
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,728
(intense music)

135
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,058
(bell dings)

136
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,502
Oh! Oh!

137
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,951
Come on, what the fuck!

138
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,394
[Bailiff] Kneel for the
honorable Judge Beelzebub.

139
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,001
(distant wailing and moaning)

140
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:54,935
What the hell?

141
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,369
Indeed.

142
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,238
I demand to know what the...

143
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,941
You can demand nothing.

144
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,277
You are here to stand trial.

145
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,314
Trial? What for,
what did I do wrong?

146
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,582
What haven't you done wrong?

147
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,718
Scribe.

148
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,755
The defendant is indicted
on the following charges,

149
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:21,561
incompetence,
ineptitude, inadequacy,

150
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,932
and a general lack of evilness.

151
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:30,637
The defendant stands accused
in the grievous lapse

152
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:36,409
of his duties as the standing
member of the demon realm.

153
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,580
Unworthy of a listing
on the canon scroll.

154
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,950
Who accuses me?

155
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,253
[Jezabeth] I do! I
bring these charges.

156
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,961
Bazoomba!

157
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,329
I'm Jezabeth, the D.A.

158
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,198
The District Attorney, huh?

159
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,101
No, Devil's Advocate.

160
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,303
I'll be prosecuting you.

161
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,307
Okay.

162
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,344
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

163
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,348
I do. I'm Killjoy!

164
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,783
(dramatic music)

165
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:17,884
(laughing)

166
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:22,289
(hammer squeaking)

167
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,460
Okay, what the hell
happened to my powers?

168
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,096
Where's my hammer?

169
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,136
You have no powers, you
pathetic laughing stock.

170
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,475
So this is malice buffoon?

171
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,379
The famous clown-hammer...

172
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,049
But, it's mine!

173
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,283
Silence.

174
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,053
You will be tried
for your indictment.

175
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,089
We will adjourn until
you get your witnesses

176
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,358
and your evidence.

177
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:02,862
If nothing else, this
will be fun. (Laughing)

178
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:21,114
(Killjoy groaning)

179
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,799
You know, Sandie, you
never talked about Killjoy.

180
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,535
After my little meeting
with the detectives,

181
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,604
I'm beginning to think
there's more to that subject.

182
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,873
Would you like to
tell me about it?

183
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,643
(laughing) Would I like
to tell you about it?

184
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:55,082
Sure, maybe I'll just laugh
in your face. (Laughing)

185
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,084
Now you're just
clowning around.

186
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,786
(laughing) Clowning
around, that's it.

187
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,655
Clowning around...

188
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,392
Did Killjoy
murder your friends?

189
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:10,397
(laughing) Yes, yes.

190
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,234
It was, it was Killjoy?

191
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,638
But Sandie, Killjoy isn't real.

192
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,809
(laughing) I knew
you would say that.

193
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,247
No one will believe what
really happened. (Laughing)

194
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:32,018
No one will believe a hysterical
little girl. (Laughing)

195
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,121
Okay, okay.

196
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,789
Let's say for argument's
sake that I believe you.

197
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,426
Killjoy the clown
murdered your friends.

198
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,494
(laughing) Yeah,
yeah. (Laughing)

199
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,663
So how come you were
the only one that escaped?

200
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,667
(laughing)

201
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,139
Laughter, is that
the key, right?

202
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,674
That's why you're laughing?

203
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,944
You're laughing to protect
yourself from a killer clown?

204
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,913
So why does that work?

205
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,483
Because that's what you're
supposed to do to a clown.

206
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,520
[Simmons] Sure, you're
supposed to laugh at a clown.

207
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,690
But nobody would
laugh at Killjoy.

208
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,627
[Sandie] Yeah, nobody
would laugh at Killjoy.

209
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,030
(laughing) That would be insane.

210
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,702
Yeah, that would be, insane.

211
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,041
(buttons beeping)

212
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,911
(phone ringing)

213
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,247
Ericson here.

214
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,182
Detective.

215
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,383
Yes, Dr. Simmons.

216
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,684
You got something for me?

217
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:39,886
I think you should continue

218
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,588
to look into this Killjoy thing.

219
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,055
You think Killjoy did it?

220
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,958
[Simmons] I don't know if
it's all in her mind or not.

221
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,827
But even if it is
her imagination,

222
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,362
I think she truly believes

223
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,465
that this demon clown
killed her friends.

224
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,202
It might be another personality.

225
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,770
Regardless, the patient's
constant laughter

226
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,806
is a way of
suppressing this thing.

227
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,210
And I think the professor's
research holds the keys.

228
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,212
Well, I'm way
ahead of you there.

229
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm becoming a virtual
expert on the subject.

230
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,982
The problem is, if Sandie's
suffering from delusions,

231
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,684
then the professor shared it.

232
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,986
[Simmons] What do you mean,
detective, explain that to me.

233
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,389
[Ericson] The professor
had a son, Michael.

234
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,690
They were estranged.

235
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,592
Before they reunited,
Michael was murdered.

236
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,228
This happened 13 years ago.

237
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,362
By Killjoy?

238
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,863
[Ericson] No, by gang members.

239
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,399
See, the professor seemed to
believe that his son Michael

240
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,302
was possessed by this demon.

241
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,703
That's interesting.

242
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,506
You think so? It gets better.

243
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,674
Indulge me.

244
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,776
Coincidentally, those
same gang members,

245
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,245
who probably killed Michael,

246
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,012
were murdered a year later.

247
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,548
No suspects?

248
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,717
No, not at the time, but
as strange as it seems,

249
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,020
I think we finally found
our person of interest.

250
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:52,492
(distant moaning)

251
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:56,263
Oh, oh that reeks.

252
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,898
I don't remember that
one sneaking out.

253
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,971
[Skid] Oh no,
no! No open flames!

254
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,206
What the...

255
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,980
Mr. Killjoy, sir.

256
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,915
Who the fuck are you?

257
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,919
Oh, I'm your biggest
fan, my name's Skid.

258
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,154
Mr. Killjoy, sir?

259
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,258
How the hell did
you get in here?

260
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,059
I can poof in and
out of many places.

261
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,828
It's one of two powers I have.

262
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,163
Yeah, well, that's great, kid.

263
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,999
Skid, it's Skid.

264
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:38,004
Kid, Skid, all I
know is, you stink!

265
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,775
You smell like a human, a
little too fresh for my taste.

266
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,078
I'm sorry about
that, sir, I'm new.

267
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,680
Just became demonic.

268
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,051
Oh, well that's just
great, just what I need,

269
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,954
a newbie, a convert, huh?

270
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:59,959
I was born a demon, I
was created a Prince.

271
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:06,399
But now, look at me,
this is pathetic!

272
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,737
How humiliating.

273
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,841
Where are my powers, huh?

274
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,044
I should be able to teleport,
too, but look at this!

275
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,346
Look at this!

276
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:22,114
Look, look at this, look
at this, look at this!

277
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,150
Nothing! Nothing...

278
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,855
You lost your mojo, sir,
you have no more powers.

279
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:37,830
But I'm motherfucking Killjoy.

280
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,900
Oh, you are
majestic, my liege.

281
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,672
So magnificent, stellar,
special, sublime!

282
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,540
[Killjoy] Yes, I am
all of those things,

283
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,208
you little shit stain,
what do you want?

284
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,177
I want to be you.

285
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,645
What?

286
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:58,685
I mean, I want to be just
like you, I could never be you,

287
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:03,690
so powerful, impressive,
monumental, svelte, endowed...

288
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,859
Alright, I get it, alright?

289
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,996
What do you want, my
autograph or something?

290
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,198
I kinda want to help.

291
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:17,203
(laughing)

292
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,639
You? (Laughing)

293
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,074
You help me?

294
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,112
(laughing)

295
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,313
How?

296
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,617
I'm your attorney.

297
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,421
Really?

298
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,228
Somebody get me out of
here, get me out of here!

299
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,965
So that about does
it for the strategy.

300
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,334
Remember, you have
to plead not guilty,

301
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:52,539
for all of these charges, you
are definitely not innocent.

302
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,642
Yeah yeah yeah, I got
that already, what else?

303
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:56,776
[Skid] Witnesses.

304
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,210
[Killjoy] What?

305
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,013
Witnesses, you know,
like character references.

306
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:04,684
Look, I'm not gonna exactly
win any popularity contests,

307
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,653
alright, what are
they gonna testify?

308
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,989
They're gonna testify
how evil you are.

309
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:14,193
Remember, you're on trial for
being too much of a softie.

310
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:19,198
You're mushy, ineffective,
uncommitted, and impotent.

311
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,601
Aright, alright, I
get the point already!

312
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,335
Too human!

313
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,239
On your last incarnation,

314
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,276
you summoned a posse
of three demons.

315
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:34,614
These demons are the
only witnesses to
your latest failure.

316
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,716
Yeah, well, they
were all destroyed.

317
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,586
And I don't have
enough power, or flesh,

318
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,387
to incarnate them again.

319
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,691
Don't worry about
that, they're demons.

320
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:47,794
They can be resurrected with
a sacrifice or something.

321
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:52,765
Look, I've got enough human
blood in me to get the job done.

322
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,503
I'll pay for it, and you
just summon them back up.

323
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:59,371
Yeah, good.

324
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:03,776
That's good, Squid, or
whatever the hell your name is.

325
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,745
No sweat, and it's Skid.

326
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,515
[Killjoy] Right, Squid.

327
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,928
Alright, here goes nothing.

328
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:24,263
Flesh for flesh.

329
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,667
Come on, come on, there's
only a little left.

330
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,244
(laughing) You were explosive.

331
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:41,113
That's just my demonic
powers. (Laughing)

332
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,683
I gotta be careful when
I fart, know what I mean?

333
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,184
(laughing)

334
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,218
[Killjoy] Yeah, sure.

335
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,153
[Skid] It's all yours.

336
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,431
I summon thee, Punchy!

337
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,935
(dramatic music)

338
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,071
(laughing)

339
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:09,108
I conjure thee, Freakshow!

340
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:14,113
(dramatic music)

341
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,950
Ahh, excellent.

342
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:26,593
(speaking gibberish)

343
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,094
Yeah, yeah, don't
think anything of it,

344
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:30,730
you big worthless piece of shit.

345
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,066
And you, don't even come
over here and touch me,

346
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,268
you're freaking me out, okay?

347
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,404
Alright, alright, you know what,

348
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,672
I'll hug your little brother.

349
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,941
He's the better of the
two of you. (Gasping)

350
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:45,177
And that is grosser
than holy sharts, man!

351
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,747
What happened to the
little guy, the Kuato?

352
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,248
You know who I'm talking about?

353
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:52,518
Yeah, yeah, alright, hey, it's
no problem, I'll just make...

354
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,953
Oh, no no no no no!

355
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,722
There's only enough
of that for three.

356
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,623
So?

357
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,957
What about Batty Boop?

358
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,761
That rectal canker, you
think I want her back?

359
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,195
She's a pain in the ass!

360
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,665
[Skid] She's the only
one who can really speak.

361
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:08,367
She can talk,
she's the best one.

362
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,372
Oh, I hate you
for being right.

363
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:16,643
Sorry Freakshow.

364
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:26,385
Ugh, I conjure thee, Batty Boop.

365
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,887
Come on out, you crazy bitch.

366
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,656
(dramatic music)

367
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,957
Boo-ya!

368
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,560
(laughing)

369
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,263
Hey, baby how you doing?

370
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,799
Snookums!

371
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,567
You won!

372
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,402
You beat the kids.

373
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,571
You defeated the professor.

374
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,975
You ate his soul and
gained his powers.

375
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:52,011
And now you're free
to roam the earth,

376
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:55,381
and cause turmoil
and destruction,

377
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,818
and you want me to join you.

378
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,687
Right?

379
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,025
Not exactly.

380
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:12,198
Oh, exactly what happened?

381
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,703
Well, sort of
kind of exactly...

382
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,706
I'm on trial for
failure of my mission,

383
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,140
letting one of the victims go,

384
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,377
and just you know, a
general lack of evilness.

385
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,847
What?

386
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,117
Batty, I lost my powers, babe.

387
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:36,122
Aww, you poor baby.

388
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,224
(yelping)

389
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,060
[Killjoy] What
the fuck, Batty?

390
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,363
You snapped your fingers
and blew me to pieces,

391
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,999
after all I done for you.

392
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,001
So I'm sorry, alright?

393
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,906
Sorry? Was that any
way to treat a lady?

394
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:58,310
(laughing)

395
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,080
[Killjoy] You a lady?
That's a good one.

396
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,582
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't!

397
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,052
You're pathetic.

398
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:09,455
I ain't doing nothing for you.

399
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,758
I'm out of here.

400
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,796
Come on, Batty, baby!

401
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,267
Come on, baby, come on back!

402
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,811
Oh, don't worry about her.

403
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,212
I'll talk her into it.

404
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,647
You just get ready for
your first court session.

405
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,950
See you there. (Farts)

406
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,220
I got this.

407
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,422
Ms. Boop? Ms. Boop?

408
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,959
Ms. Boop? Ms. Boop? Ms. Boop!

409
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,331
Ms. Boop? Ms. Boop?

410
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,969
What the hell do
you want, squirt?

411
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,871
Can I just ask
you some questions

412
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,372
about your old boyfriend?

413
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:03,275
No, I don't like him no more.

414
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,610
Oh, okay I know.

415
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,678
But could you do it
for old time's sake?

416
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,547
Do I know you?

417
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,818
Perhaps in a past life?

418
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:14,153
In your dreams, Romeo.

419
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,188
Ms. Boop, I'm
your biggest fan.

420
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,891
Could you just answer some
questions about my client?

421
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,127
You know, for old time's sake?

422
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:26,032
Yes, alright for
old time's sake.

423
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:29,001
I do have some good memories
with the whack bastard.

424
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,938
I wanna know all
of Killjoy's tricks.

425
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,841
I wanna know everything.

426
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:41,347
(intense music)

427
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,484
(banging)

428
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:50,256
Order, order!

429
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,559
Court is now in session.

430
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,894
Let's get to it.

431
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,395
Did you get your witness?

432
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,696
Yes, your honor.

433
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,601
You may start, my dear.

434
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:04,403
Killjoy...

435
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,537
I object!

436
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,274
To what?

437
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,111
I don't know, I guess I
just got a little excited.

438
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,745
Do you even know
what you're doing?

439
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,983
Keep it in your
pants, or else.

440
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,250
Or else?

441
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,287
(zapping)

442
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:25,257
[Beelzebub] I saw
that in a movie once.

443
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,927
I could do that all day.

444
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,728
Go on, my dear.

445
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,899
Killjoy, king of
the trickster gods,

446
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:36,202
the royal jester of hell,

447
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,538
he has been tormenting
humanity from the beginning.

448
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,943
But somewhere in history,
the accused has become...

449
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,178
a joke.

450
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,448
Whereas previously,
Killjoy would strike terror

451
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,983
with his macabre tricks.

452
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,419
He is now laughed at.

453
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,455
The one that got away.

454
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,656
The what? The who?

455
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,158
Silence!

456
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:03,595
Killjoy, once a god of skill,
wisdom, and intelligence...

457
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,496
Once?

458
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,366
Now a pathetic clown.

459
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:13,372
Can Killjoy fill those
very, very big shoes?

460
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,806
Aww man.

461
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,044
Perhaps the realm is ready
for a new trickster king,

462
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:23,049
a new harlequin,
a new top clown.

463
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,750
No!

464
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,688
Killjoy is known
by many names.

465
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,225
And he is worthy of none.

466
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,962
Agreed.

467
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,096
Scribe...

468
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,802
(dramatic music)

469
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,606
What just happened?

470
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,542
Once a name is crossed,
it's gone forever.

471
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,713
What happened to
confession before punishment?

472
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:59,718
This is Hell, punishment
is part of the process.

473
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,321
Was it more than
you anticipated?

474
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,589
Counselor?

475
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,992
Oh boy, my turn.

476
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,432
Ladies and germs,
devils and demons,

477
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,269
my client Killjoy
didn't do nothing!

478
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,537
[Killjoy] What are you doing?

479
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,340
I know, that's why he's here.

480
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,409
I mean he's innocent.

481
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:24,476
Fuck!

482
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,613
No, I'm evil! Say I'm evil!

483
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,749
I mean you couldn't
ask for a nicer guy.

484
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,519
I think that's the problem.

485
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,853
Well put, Counselor.

486
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:35,721
Thank you.

487
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,323
Oh, just shut up.

488
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,458
Just goddamn motherfucking
shut your mouth.

489
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,892
What I meant to say...

490
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,395
Counselor, sit down.

491
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:48,200
I don't want this trial
to end before it starts.

492
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,040
Do you even know what
the fuck you're doing?

493
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,842
I'm sorry, I just
got a little nervous.

494
00:32:56,842 --> 00:33:00,546
Oh, if I had my powers,
I would pie you so hard.

495
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:03,182
(groaning)

496
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,284
Damn it, not even a cupcake.

497
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:08,354
Where'd you get your degree
anyway, correspondence school?

498
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,755
Oh, hell no.

499
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,689
Ah, good.

500
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,059
I got it online.

501
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,094
They took life-experience
as credit.

502
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,970
Okay Sandie, we're not gonna

503
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,338
assume that you're the killer.

504
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,307
Just tell us what
happened that night.

505
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,077
(laughing) You really
wanna know what happened?

506
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:32,178
Yes.

507
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,681
(laughing) As
crazy as it sounds?

508
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,217
Yes, as bat-shit
crazy as it sounds.

509
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,322
Just tell us what happened
that night, as you saw it.

510
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,726
Answer the question.

511
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,366
Damn, he's useless.
He can't even talk.

512
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,102
Doesn't the court
understand that?

513
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:57,569
The court doesn't care.

514
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,473
I will assume that the
witness' refusal to speak,

515
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:06,011
his silence, is an admission
of the defendant's guilt.

516
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,814
I object! That
doesn't make any sense!

517
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:09,981
Yeah, he's a mime!

518
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,151
This is bullshit, it's not fair.

519
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,220
Now you're getting it.

520
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,823
You know, if we had
Freakshow's brother,
he could talk.

521
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,924
But we couldn't bring him back.

522
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,126
Why not?

523
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,893
We didn't have enough
flesh, your honor.

524
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:23,729
Too bad.

525
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:24,996
Bailiff!

526
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:36,142
Scribe, strike another
name off the register.

527
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,411
(screaming)

528
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,612
Make it two.

529
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:48,854
(groaning)

530
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,929
Those things will shorten
your lifespan, detective.

531
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,565
So will working
the graveyard shift.

532
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,032
Make your point.

533
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,769
[Grimley] Now that I don't
have a beat on the night shift,

534
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,404
I got time to spare.

535
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,038
Watch your count, detective.

536
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,907
Those things kill more
people than bullets do.

537
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,243
What do you think about
that nut-job's story.

538
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,078
Well, clearly it's tunes.

539
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,846
But I think she
really believes it.

540
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,215
No way.

541
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,549
[Ericson] At least
she's cooperating with us.

542
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,950
Even if it is a fantasy.

543
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,220
[Grimley] Maybe just looks
like she's cooperating.

544
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,622
The girl is singing
and I'm gonna listen.

545
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,492
As long as she blabs, we're
getting information out of her.

546
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,260
Fuck it, maybe you're right.

547
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,461
So how do you wanna proceed?

548
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,197
Proceed like it's
a true account.

549
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,064
Track down some leads.

550
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,033
Now we look crazy.

551
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,303
Who's the suspect?

552
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,205
Killjoy.

553
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,206
Accomplices?

554
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,740
- Punchy.
- Sounds tough.

555
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,675
- Freakshow.
- Puss.

556
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,213
And Batty Boop, the
suspect's girlfriend.

557
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,014
Kinky. (Laughing)

558
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,482
Any aliases?

559
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,084
Yeah, 50 of them.

560
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,720
I thought it was 53.

561
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,022
Really, 53?

562
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,228
Hold on, I've got
three files missing.

563
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,329
So what?

564
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,063
They weren't before.

565
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,665
This is weird.

566
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,434
Do you remember the names?

567
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,371
I think we've
gotta talk to Sandie.

568
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,839
Alright, when?

569
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,075
[Ericson] As soon as possible.

570
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:22,814
(intense music)

571
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,751
[Jezabeth] Punchy the clown...

572
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,254
Created by Killjoy...

573
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:32,090
Incarnated with the spirit
of the demon Behemoth.

574
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,728
My, you are a big
boy, aren't you?

575
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,531
Where were you on the
night in question?

576
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:43,935
(speaking gibberish)

577
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,471
I'm sorry, I
didn't catch that.

578
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:49,975
(speaking gibberish)

579
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,511
I still don't understand,
what language is he speaking?

580
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,613
He only speaks Carnie.

581
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,350
[Beelzebub] Is there anyone
here that speaks Carnie?

582
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,622
Great.

583
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,293
Does anyone here speak Mime?

584
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,761
Or can play charades very well?

585
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,731
Oh me, me! I love charades!

586
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,067
Or as the Romans say, Pantomime.

587
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,671
Continue with
your cross, please.

588
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:24,576
Punchy, you were with Killjoy
on the night in question?

589
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,578
(speaking gibberish)

590
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,216
Yes.

591
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,352
And it was your
job to help Killjoy

592
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:36,455
acquire those nubile young
souls of these teenagers?

593
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,156
(speaking gibberish)

594
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,092
- Yes...
- Yes, yes!

595
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,329
Just say yes, he just did
the same friggin thing!

596
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,131
Briefly, tell
me what happened.

597
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:51,136
(speaking gibberish)

598
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:18,464
We had a really fun
time with the kids.

599
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,266
We gave them a yummy dinner.

600
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,836
And Killjoy was a nice host.

601
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,104
What?

602
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,441
(speaking gibberish)

603
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,610
Yup, that's correct.

604
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,179
Are you sure that's
exactly what he said?

605
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,747
Yeah, sure.

606
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,016
Damn it, he must be
still mad about his

607
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,285
shitty work
conditions, long hours,

608
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,087
and lack of health insurance.

609
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:46,024
Well, it sounds like
things were downright rosy.

610
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:50,429
That does not fit the
personality requirements
of a hellion.

611
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,199
At least, not to the
standard of an evil demon.

612
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,403
No more questions.

613
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,269
Fine.

614
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,939
But, but, but I am evil!

615
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,408
Let me prove it to you!

616
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:03,475
Order!
(banging)

617
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:11,016
Scribe.

618
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,288
(groaning)

619
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,924
I'm fading, I'm fading fast.

620
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,326
Counselor, your turn.

621
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,329
No, no, no questions alright?

622
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,932
My grave is getting
deeper by the minute.

623
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:31,102
No questions, your honor.

624
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,104
So be it.

625
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:40,679
(growling)

626
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,019
Who's the next witness?

627
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,823
The court summons
the succubus clown,

628
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,460
Ms. Batty Boop.

629
00:39:55,461 --> 00:40:00,466
(sexy music)

630
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,337
(grunting)

631
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,507
Almost perfect.

632
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,642
(laughing) Clown...

633
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,044
Fuck off.

634
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,224
So...

635
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,498
You're Batty Boop.

636
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,267
Batty, Batty Boop.

637
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:41,740
Yeah, that's my name,
don't wear it out.

638
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:47,713
Ms. Boop, tell us about your
relationship with Mr. Joy.

639
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,183
That's Killjoy!

640
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,319
Emphasis on the kill part.

641
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,589
I guess he's my boyfriend.

642
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:01,092
I mean, I think
he's a dreamboat.

643
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,361
He's so evil.

644
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,763
Thank you, Batty.

645
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,034
But that was
before I caught him

646
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,938
frolicking with his
prey, little Ms co-ed.

647
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:16,608
He was actually
gonna do it with her.

648
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,443
It?

649
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,545
Sex.

650
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:21,412
[Beelzebub] Yeah, so?

651
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,982
Consensual sex.

652
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,551
No...

653
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,218
Consensual sex?

654
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,688
You know what that leads to.

655
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,556
Cuddling.

656
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:32,257
But she was a virgin.

657
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:35,393
A minor point in your favor.

658
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:36,828
Continue.

659
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,565
What happened
after you caught him

660
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:41,933
with that human?

661
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,736
Then fish-poop over there

662
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,772
decided he didn't
want me no more.

663
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,241
He snapped his fingers
and blew me to pieces.

664
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,311
Then what? What
did the bastard do?

665
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,815
He made a splendid
feast for her.

666
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,684
The main course,
tell the court

667
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,752
about the main course, Batty!

668
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,120
Silence.

669
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:06,491
He just threw
you away didn't he?

670
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,425
Yeah.

671
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:10,061
Like a piece of tissue paper.

672
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:11,062
Yeah.

673
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,497
He just blew his wad in you,

674
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,832
and threw you over his shoulder.

675
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:14,700
Yeah.

676
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,867
- No calls.
- Yeah.

677
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,368
- No letters.
- Yeah.

678
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,837
No emails.

679
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:20,872
What?

680
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,173
Oh, man.

681
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,309
Oh, man what?

682
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,613
I just recognized her.

683
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:28,847
Yeah, it's me!

684
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:32,383
After all we went through.

685
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,420
I'm gonna nail you, sucker.

686
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:39,625
Dog-breath, what's
she talking about?

687
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,994
(laughing) Batty, it was
before I met you, okay?

688
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,330
It was a wild week
of drunkenness,

689
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,265
a ton of sex and drugs...

690
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,967
It was a good time at first,

691
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,435
but then I realized that I was

692
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:52,638
wasting my time not
concentrating on the things

693
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,439
that I really loved.

694
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:59,210
You dropped me
like a bad habit.

695
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,879
You were a bad habit!

696
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,448
So addictive and needy!

697
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,917
The first chance I saw, I
got the hell out of there.

698
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,486
So that's your M.O.

699
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:09,688
Fool around with the girl,

700
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,657
get her hopes up
and then ditch her.

701
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:14,926
Batty, Batty I shouldn't
have blown you up, okay?

702
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,228
You know I could've brought
you back at any time.

703
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,364
That's not good enough.

704
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,999
Who'd you leave me for?

705
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:25,003
I didn't leave you, I
just kind of vaporized you.

706
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:28,707
And for your information,
there is nobody else.

707
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,676
There isn't?

708
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,678
No, there isn't, I promise.

709
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:35,480
What do you want from me, Batty?

710
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,917
You know what I want.

711
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,920
Alright, alright Batty, okay.

712
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,123
I apologize, alright?

713
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,694
I'm sorry, there I said
it, are you happy now?

714
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,899
Very sweet, very sweet indeed.

715
00:43:58,003 --> 00:44:01,172
What a nice apology.

716
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,041
Did I just apologize?

717
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:03,942
[Skid] Yep.

718
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,911
In public?

719
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,747
[Beelzebub] Yes, you did.

720
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:13,018
What a humble, noble,
thoughtful thing to do.

721
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,019
Oh, shit.

722
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,723
I didn't mean to do that.

723
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:21,259
I mean, that's not what
I wanted to happen.

724
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:25,831
Not evil! He's not evil.

725
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:28,533
I don't accept it.

726
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,435
I don't accept the apology.

727
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:35,440
Too late, Scribe,
that will be 20 names.

728
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:39,811
(dramatic music)

729
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:43,381
No, no, no, no.

730
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:48,386
(groaning)

731
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,790
(gasping)

732
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,763
I've had enough for the day.

733
00:44:58,764 --> 00:45:00,031
The next session will be.

734
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,334
Killjoy on the stand.

735
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,104
Court is dismissed.

736
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,541
[Bailiff] All rise!

737
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,783
Well, that was a disaster.

738
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,785
What do we do next?

739
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,587
I don't know.

740
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:28,827
You're next.

741
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,215
(phone ringing)

742
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,249
[Simmons] Hello?

743
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,517
Dr. Simmons?

744
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,219
[Simmons] Detective,
it's very late.

745
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,887
Is something wrong?

746
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,155
You could say that.

747
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,490
We need to see you at
your office right now.

748
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,894
[Simmons] Alright, I'll be
there as soon as I can, bye.

749
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:19,845
Hello there.

750
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,516
I think I have something
you're looking for.

751
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,123
But first, you need
to give me something.

752
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,128
(moaning)

753
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,782
Oh, I see.

754
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,319
You like my magic mirror?

755
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,659
You can use it if you like.

756
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:13,731
But I need something in return.

757
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:21,940
Come to Mama!

758
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:30,415
(laughing)

759
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:35,420
(intense music)

760
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:42,127
I say we take them
all by storm, now!

761
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:44,429
But the guards,
they're too strong.

762
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,232
We could take them if
we all work together.

763
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,834
Remember, together.
Together.

764
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:53,638
Nonsense, you
rat-faced buffoon.

765
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:57,075
We let the trial play out.

766
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:00,578
It's time for a new
top clown around here.

767
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,216
We've decided to leave
Killjoy to the fates.

768
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:09,254
Even if he survives the
trial, they'll snuff him out.

769
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,222
If he survives,
we'll follow him.

770
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,960
Make sure nobody
stabs him in the back.

771
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,729
Yeah, it should be our
decision, the whole lot of us.

772
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,732
(laughter)

773
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,268
Ridiculous.

774
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:27,038
So, you think you can
start a little club

775
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,007
and upset the apple cart?

776
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:33,844
Go ahead, pie the little fuck!

777
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:35,981
(laughing)

778
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:40,986
[Clown] Punchy!

779
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,754
That's right, motha-fucka.

780
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,758
Punchy the clown,
baddest mofo there is.

781
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,062
But, but a harlequin
can't get hit with a pie!

782
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:54,299
And a hobo can't prey
on another clown.

783
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,733
That's the way it is.

784
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,702
That's the way it's always been.

785
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,771
(splattering)

786
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,216
[Clown] So boss,
what's the plan?

787
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:14,352
Plan?

788
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,154
I'm dying out there.

789
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:19,057
What the hell is my
lawyer good for anyway?

790
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,126
My ass actually hurts.

791
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,428
I need an enema. I
need a beer enema.

792
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,763
I need a beer enema
and Jello shot.

793
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:28,133
That's what I need. Batty!

794
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,435
You look surprised to see me.

795
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:31,602
[Killjoy] Surprised?

796
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:32,903
You hung me out
to dry out there.

797
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,440
Hey, I was just
speaking my mind.

798
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,742
Didn't take you
too long did it?

799
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,145
Kiss my ass.

800
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,380
I was trying to help you...

801
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,549
Yeah? You could've fooled me.

802
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:46,484
I'm getting killed out there.

803
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,119
My lawyer is useless.

804
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,555
Half of my names have
just disappeared.

805
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,557
I can't remember any of them.

806
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,627
Look, I'm fading,
Batty, I'm fading fast.

807
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:58,896
I know, Snookums,
it don't look good.

808
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,731
And you don't got any powers.

809
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,267
I know, I know.

810
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:05,336
I'm helpless. I can't
do shit, alright?

811
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,739
I need help.

812
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,209
I need you Batty.

813
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:16,147
That's all I wanted to hear.

814
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:18,749
I've got a plan.

815
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,386
What? You have a plan?

816
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:23,821
[Batty] Yeah, don't
act so surprised.

817
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,756
Alright, alright,
just what is it?

818
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,993
I'm gonna go get the mortal.

819
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,163
The mortal? The mortal?

820
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,099
[Batty] Yeah, the mortal.

821
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:37,368
The mortal? The girl, yes.

822
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,337
The one that got away.

823
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:42,006
That's right, the virgin.

824
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:45,076
Yeah, the virgin is the reason

825
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,178
that I'm here in
the first place.

826
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:50,381
The virgin is the reason
I don't have any powers.

827
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,352
I can still hear her
in here, you know?

828
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:58,289
Laughing all the time,
she doesn't stop.

829
00:50:58,289 --> 00:50:59,657
I don't know how she does it.

830
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:02,493
She's our next witness, okay?

831
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:06,297
And she's the only one that
can give you your powers back.

832
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,866
We gotta call her to the stand.

833
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,369
Fat chance of that.

834
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,371
She'll be the first
to condemn me.

835
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:15,573
She'll rake me over the coals.

836
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,275
And she'll laugh
the entire time.

837
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:21,779
Then you're gonna have to
find some way to convince her.

838
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,414
Ah, I don't know.

839
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:27,218
How do you plan on getting
up there anyway, huh?

840
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:28,486
The magic elevator?

841
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:30,255
Guess what, you
need a key for that.

842
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,390
I don't know yet.

843
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,232
Freakshow, you ready?

844
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:51,976
Ah, I get it, you
miss your brother, huh?

845
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,581
You want a prosthetic
conjoined twin, huh?

846
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,484
You want a bionic brother now.

847
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,752
Stand back, I got this.

848
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,560
(laughing)

849
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,438
Just like new.

850
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:22,207
Mommy.

851
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,478
That was
disgusting. (Laughing)

852
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,215
You've got her
spit in your hole.

853
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:31,682
That's gross, man.

854
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:35,220
[Batty] What?

855
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,488
A mirror?

856
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,656
A magic mirror?

857
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,625
A mirror with saggy
titties and you...

858
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:44,229
Oh, a mirror, the magic
mirror at the old hag's.

859
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,932
Yeah, that's it.

860
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,635
Freakshow and I are
gonna go get that girl.

861
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:54,905
We'll use the old hag's damn
mirror for transportation.

862
00:52:58,676 --> 00:52:59,844
Excellent.

863
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:05,283
Why did you leave Jezabeth?

864
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,051
Who?

865
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:08,453
The D.A.

866
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,389
You were with her,
way before me.

867
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,824
And she's stunning.

868
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:17,328
[Killjoy] Batty, look at me.

869
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,832
I left her for you.

870
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,437
(emotional music)

871
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,506
(Batty moaning)

872
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,675
(laughing)

873
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,483
See you in court.

874
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:39,784
Oh, yeah.

875
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,421
Oh, hey Batty?

876
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,291
Where's Punchy?

877
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:49,427
Punchy? He's putting
together a plan.

878
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:54,465
(laughing)

879
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:59,504
Punchy? Plan?

880
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:05,209
So, you come up
with a plan yet, boss?

881
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:09,580
(sighing)

882
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,149
Killjoy's lost his mojo.

883
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:13,951
I don't see how he can
get out of this one.

884
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,454
Unless he has a
trick up his sleeve.

885
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,756
I don't think
he's got any tricks.

886
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,325
That's it.

887
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:24,329
We give him a bag of tricks.

888
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:26,964
He don't need no
powers with those.

889
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,967
(speaking gibberish)

890
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,336
Good idea.

891
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:34,038
Alright clowns, you've
all gotta contribute.

892
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:36,607
One trick each.

893
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:47,618
How do you work this thing?

894
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,119
I lost the remote.

895
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,489
Great, what do we do now?

896
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,391
How about technical support?

897
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:55,793
Not that again.

898
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:01,432
Good thinking there,
fish lips. Plug it in.

899
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,872
(beeping)

900
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:11,208
There she is.

901
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:15,045
Okay, I'll input the route.

902
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:17,615
What?

903
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,083
There's not enough bars.

904
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,519
You need more power
or a different mode.

905
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,524
Oh, that's right,
clown mode compression.

906
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,295
The same one used in
those little clown cars.

907
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,531
Let's go.

908
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:39,003
[Hag] Come back in one piece.

909
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:44,575
I want to have a chance to
play with your new attachment.

910
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,076
Mommy.

911
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:02,827
[Radio] Jim, bring patient 256

912
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:05,463
to my office as soon as you can.

913
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,965
[Jim] Copy that. Out.

914
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,113
(knocking at door)

915
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,483
Come In.

916
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,051
Thank you doc, for seeing
us on such short notice.

917
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:02,753
Something extremely
weird Is going on here.

918
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,121
We're losing
evidence like crazy.

919
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,790
[Simmons] Yeah,
me too, detectives.

920
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,291
I share your concern.

921
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,794
I've already asked security
to bring Sandie to my office.

922
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:11,962
(knocking at door)

923
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:15,132
Ms. Giggles? Wake up.

924
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:19,504
Someone's here to see you.

925
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,540
(laughing)

926
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,544
(booming)

927
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:28,779
What the hell...

928
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,249
(whooshing)

929
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,552
The hell Is that?

930
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:04,882
(rapid knocking)

931
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:14,324
(suspenseful music)

932
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,164
What the hell?

933
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,873
(shrieking)

934
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:33,177
(screaming)

935
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:38,182
(gasping)

936
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,798
Show us your
computer files, doc.

937
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,902
All references to Killjoy's
names are disappearing.

938
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:00,004
I can't even remember
what they are.

939
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:01,606
See, this is
happening to me too.

940
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,908
I only know that
something is missing.

941
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,644
What's taking your
security guy so long?

942
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,280
Jim, Jim do you copy?

943
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,618
Jim, Jim do you copy, Jim?

944
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,987
Should we call 911?

945
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,624
I am 911.

946
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:25,495
Ericson?

947
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,497
You there?

948
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:32,502
(suspenseful music)

949
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:52,422
Damn, who put this up?

950
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,660
How'd they put it up?

951
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,296
[Batty] Do you like it?

952
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:03,400
Maybe it should be
a little higher.

953
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,836
Don't move. Put your
hands on your head.

954
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:10,607
Oh, brother. You're gonna
pull that routine on me?

955
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,843
Get on the ground.
Kiss the floor.

956
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:16,246
(moaning)

957
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,386
(gunshot)

958
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:32,396
(gunshot)

959
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,766
(groaning)

960
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:42,907
(suspenseful music)

961
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:03,227
(screaming)

962
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:12,102
(Sandie laughing)

963
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:35,259
What are you?

964
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:37,194
If we had more time,

965
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,562
we'd have a lot of fun.

966
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,664
But I'm here on business.

967
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:43,834
(hissing)

968
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:49,373
(laughing)

969
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,114
It's fucking true.

970
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,387
What do I do?

971
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,022
Run.

972
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:14,024
Run!

973
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:20,030
(laughing nervously)

974
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,559
(sighing)

975
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,629
You can't hurt me. (Laughing)

976
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:53,898
I'm laughing.

977
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,567
I'm laughing at you.

978
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:00,104
I ain't gonna hurt you.

979
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,510
Yet.

980
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:14,551
How about that?
Kicking and screaming.

981
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,259
Jim? Jim do you copy?

982
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,230
Jim, where are you? Jim?

983
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:29,766
I'm gonna go help your partner.

984
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,401
I don't think he knows
where they're at.

985
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:40,410
(beeping)

986
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:46,350
(suspenseful music)

987
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,061
(whispering) Oh, shit...

988
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,846
Jim?

989
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,017
Shit...

990
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:34,531
(ominous music)

991
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:39,869
(beeping)

992
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:49,813
Grimley?

993
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:51,015
(laughter)

994
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:52,016
Grimley?
(laughter)

995
01:05:52,016 --> 01:05:53,283
(laughter)

996
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,042
[Baby] Mommy.

997
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,277
(dramatic music)

998
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:22,246
(hissing)

999
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:23,580
(chuckling)

1000
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:28,585
(screaming)

1001
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:42,599
Kill. Joy.

1002
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,153
(knocking)

1003
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:07,624
[Killjoy] Who is
it? What do you want?

1004
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,594
[Beelzebub] I want to
show you something, Killjoy.

1005
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:18,468
Beelzebub?

1006
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:24,641
What's that?

1007
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,110
A little insurance.

1008
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,544
Would you like to
know what's in it?

1009
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,113
Oh, I would.

1010
01:07:29,113 --> 01:07:31,448
There'll be time
for that later.

1011
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,150
Come with me.

1012
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,960
(grinding)

1013
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,430
(slamming)

1014
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,737
Come on, I'm gonna take
you on a little trip.

1015
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,006
It might be the last
time you get out.

1016
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:06,616
(slamming)

1017
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,059
(beeping)

1018
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:24,434
(whooshing)

1019
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,236
Where are we going?

1020
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,338
To a very special place.

1021
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:36,413
So, am I still on trial?

1022
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:38,715
(laughing) You sure are.

1023
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:40,684
Then why are we doing this?

1024
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,353
There's something
I want to see.

1025
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:47,090
Sir, I don't follow.

1026
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,193
When you're as old as I am,

1027
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:51,661
you start to think about
things differently.

1028
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:55,399
When something dies, there's
usually something left behind.

1029
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,434
Like a body or some bones.

1030
01:08:57,434 --> 01:09:00,904
But when a memory dies,
it's gone forever.

1031
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:05,409
Except for one thing.

1032
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:11,315
What thing? What's that?

1033
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:18,255
[Beelzebub] The one thing
I remember is a feeling.

1034
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,459
An emotion, a residual tone.

1035
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,862
Tell me, what do you see?

1036
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:34,438
[Killjoy] It's like a
dying sun that's fading.

1037
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,541
The final circle of hell.

1038
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,109
It's not what you'd expect.

1039
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:41,811
No fire...

1040
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:43,513
No torture...

1041
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,749
It's not even cold.

1042
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,584
It's nothing.

1043
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:50,754
Welcome to oblivion.

1044
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,562
[Killjoy] Why are
you showing me this?

1045
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:01,831
All my names are disappearing.

1046
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,268
Soon I'll be erased forever.

1047
01:10:05,269 --> 01:10:08,838
It will be like you
had never existed.

1048
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,875
No one will know that
you have ever been.

1049
01:10:13,243 --> 01:10:17,381
The only thing that
you'll feel, is emptiness.

1050
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,251
But, if I cease to exist,

1051
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,487
then why did you bring
me to this place?

1052
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,989
It seems like a waste of time.

1053
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,658
It wasn't for you.

1054
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:31,861
I wanted to see the
look on your face.

1055
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:35,198
I will remember that feeling.

1056
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:37,467
(laughing)

1057
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,436
Answer the question.

1058
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:40,804
[Jezabeth] Are you
responsible to harvest

1059
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,739
those souls you
claimed? Yes or no.

1060
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,007
Yes.

1061
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:45,375
Then when you let
the last one get away,

1062
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,711
you failed in that
responsibility. Yes or no?

1063
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:49,513
It's not as simple as that.

1064
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,883
Yes or no?

1065
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:56,353
Yes.

1066
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,524
Scribe, strike
some more names.

1067
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:01,625
Wait, wait.

1068
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:03,693
No, no, no!

1069
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:04,928
This is shit!

1070
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,564
[Beelzebub] Now
we've got some fire.

1071
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,499
Get to the point.

1072
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:14,938
I live for the
torment of humans.

1073
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,876
Their pain is sweet
and delicious.

1074
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:23,146
Their agonizing cries are
like music to my ears.

1075
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:25,882
How dare you question that!

1076
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:31,087
That little
brown-noser, my lawyer,

1077
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:34,391
has been dropping the
ball every single time.

1078
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:37,394
From day one, he's been
sabotaging my case.

1079
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:40,163
And he's not even a real demon.

1080
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:42,699
He's merely demonic.

1081
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,371
Well you're not the easiest
client to work for, you know?

1082
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:49,806
Fuck you and the
ass you rode in on.

1083
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,040
You're fired!

1084
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,742
But I'm your biggest fan.

1085
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,844
You are a wanna-be.

1086
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:58,815
From now on, I'm gonna
represent myself.

1087
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,485
Now get out of my sight
before I break you in half,

1088
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:04,388
you human...

1089
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,991
Well if that's the
way you want it, fine!

1090
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,560
See you in Hell, Killjoy.

1091
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,272
Clown mode?

1092
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:24,908
I'm a clown?

1093
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:26,810
(beeping)

1094
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,180
(beeping)

1095
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:34,283
Boo-ya.

1096
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:36,420
Hmm...

1097
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:39,856
Ah, the mirror.

1098
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:42,125
We can use it to...

1099
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,226
(gasping)

1100
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:46,062
Damn it.

1101
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:48,598
[Beelzebub] Now that
you're representing yourself,

1102
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,667
what is your next motion?

1103
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,973
I motion...

1104
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:00,444
I think I'm ready
for a verdict.

1105
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,449
I call my first witness.

1106
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:11,220
The mortal. The
one that got away.

1107
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,360
(laughing)

1108
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,462
No way.

1109
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:22,131
I beat you. (Laughing)

1110
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:24,734
I beat you.

1111
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,474
Who are you?

1112
01:13:30,474 --> 01:13:34,043
The devil. Take
your seat please.

1113
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:07,076
Hey, where's the squirt?

1114
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:08,878
I fired him.

1115
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:12,081
Good, he was trouble.

1116
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:14,250
He looked familiar too.

1117
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,553
Like a bad one night stand,

1118
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:19,322
when you turn on the
lights in the morning.

1119
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:23,927
Yeah, yeah, hey Batty?

1120
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,829
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

1121
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,032
When it's your turn
to cross examine,

1122
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,536
you should ask her this...

1123
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:36,673
(whispering)

1124
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,543
(laughing) Yes.

1125
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:42,045
Will you please
account for your ordeal

1126
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:44,080
involving Killjoy in
the night in question.

1127
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:50,186
It all started because I was

1128
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:52,556
house-sitting my
professor's house and...

1129
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:58,828
(suspenseful music)

1130
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:31,861
Killjoy murdered all my friends.

1131
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:36,866
(laughing)

1132
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,938
That seems pretty cut and dry.

1133
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:53,717
Killjoy, your witness.

1134
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,853
Wish me luck.

1135
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,729
(Killjoy laughing)

1136
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:08,031
Hey there. Long time no see.

1137
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:09,799
Fuck you.

1138
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:11,801
Feisty. What's got
your panties in a bunch?

1139
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:14,771
This is what I call
a hostile witness.

1140
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:16,172
Hostile?

1141
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:17,974
You wanna see hostile?

1142
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:21,477
(banging)

1143
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:23,980
Let's get on with it.

1144
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:27,116
(muttering)

1145
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,689
Well that was an
accurate and thorough

1146
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,659
representation of
the night's events.

1147
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:39,328
And granted, you
were victorious.

1148
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:43,967
But, I just have one
question for you.

1149
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:48,672
How did it make you feel?

1150
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:54,744
Feel? How am I supposed
to feel, you son of a bitch?

1151
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:58,748
You stabbed Zilla in the heart.

1152
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:01,851
You smashed my boyfriend's head,

1153
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:03,853
clear off his body
in a bloody mess.

1154
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,690
And you squashed the professor

1155
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:10,159
into a pile of blood and goo.

1156
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:13,697
My best friend was eaten alive.

1157
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:17,801
What kind of filthy,
foul monster,

1158
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:20,236
would ask me how I feel?

1159
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:27,744
I'm stuck in a nut-house
and I can't stop laughing.

1160
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,314
I have no family, no
friends, no future,

1161
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:33,883
all because of your
heartless games.

1162
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,153
I hope you rot.

1163
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:40,957
I hope you burn forever.

1164
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:44,928
(laughing) Man, she sure
ripped you a new asshole.

1165
01:17:44,928 --> 01:17:46,162
Tell me about it.

1166
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,231
I didn't really need
more than two of them.

1167
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:49,733
[Beelzebub] That was well put.

1168
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:51,735
Thoughtless, heartless, cruel,

1169
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:54,270
insensitive, filthy, foul.

1170
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:58,541
You're starting to sound
like a demon again.

1171
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:01,177
But, he's not. He's not evil.

1172
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,311
Hush.

1173
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:04,447
So, I'm good to go?

1174
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:05,982
Stamp me evil?

1175
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:08,017
Not so fast.

1176
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,419
You've absorbed a
lot of human empathy

1177
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,256
in your little quest
to incarnate on earth.

1178
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:16,325
You've got a lot of
mortal souls in you.

1179
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:19,562
But I think you've earned
yourself a fighting chance.

1180
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:21,030
What do you need from me?

1181
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,966
Anything, I'll do
anything, come on.

1182
01:18:22,966 --> 01:18:25,034
Trial by combat.

1183
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,035
(banging)

1184
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,771
Oh, anything but that.

1185
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:28,905
I mean, come on.

1186
01:18:28,905 --> 01:18:31,374
I present to you,
your challenger.

1187
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,342
Next in line for your job.

1188
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:38,447
What?

1189
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,786
Skid Mark? You've
gotta be kidding me.

1190
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,488
Yep, it's me.
Put up your dukes.

1191
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,090
I want your job.

1192
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:49,292
[Killjoy] You gotta be joking.

1193
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,260
(booming)

1194
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:54,563
(laughing)

1195
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,364
(bell dinging)

1196
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:56,632
Fight!

1197
01:18:58,802 --> 01:18:59,969
(screaming)

1198
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:01,704
(groaning)

1199
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,273
I'm gonna kill you.

1200
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:11,881
You are a pathetic
excuse for a demon.

1201
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:13,616
Merely human...

1202
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:15,651
(groaning)

1203
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:20,489
Atomic wedgie!

1204
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,825
(screaming)

1205
01:19:21,825 --> 01:19:22,992
(laughing)

1206
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,660
That's gotta hurt.
That's gotta hurt.

1207
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:31,134
Oh, yeah!

1208
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:33,736
Love you guys.

1209
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:40,709
(laughing) So what's
your second trick, human?

1210
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,912
Oh, it's a good one.

1211
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:45,148
And you've got Batty
to thank for it.

1212
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:50,186
You, it's you!

1213
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,055
What are you talking about?

1214
01:19:52,055 --> 01:19:54,090
He was one of my victims.

1215
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:55,724
I had him at a frat-party.

1216
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:57,894
But I don't remember
what happened.

1217
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:59,762
Oh, you had me alright.

1218
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,165
One bite. That's all it took.

1219
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:03,867
Why didn't you
just finish him off?

1220
01:20:03,867 --> 01:20:05,168
You should've killed him.

1221
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:07,570
I know, I passed out.

1222
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,672
I slipped her a little
something-something.

1223
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:11,540
You roofied me?

1224
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,376
You rapist pig!

1225
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:16,212
Batty, I love you.

1226
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:18,481
When Hell freezes over.

1227
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:23,486
No, when I win, the
deal is your ass is mine.

1228
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,388
Oh, like hell it is.

1229
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:26,923
I'm gonna end you now.

1230
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:28,524
You puny human.

1231
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:31,627
Not quite.
Remember what I said.

1232
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,963
You've got Batty
to thank for this.

1233
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:35,865
For what?

1234
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:38,801
Her love bite.
And my second trick.

1235
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:41,604
(groaning)

1236
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:43,806
(suspenseful music)
(groaning)

1237
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:44,941
Oh...

1238
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:49,478
Oh!

1239
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:52,748
He's infected.

1240
01:20:56,152 --> 01:21:01,157
(growling)

1241
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:07,063
Oh, shit!

1242
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,465
Check me out.

1243
01:21:13,336 --> 01:21:15,371
Not so puny now.

1244
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,573
Hey boss, here!

1245
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:22,011
(laughing)

1246
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:23,279
A bag of tricks.

1247
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:28,952
Yum.

1248
01:21:30,954 --> 01:21:32,989
(laughing)

1249
01:21:39,963 --> 01:21:42,331
[Skid] You're mine, Killjoy.

1250
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:47,070
(laughing) Aww, yeah.

1251
01:21:48,972 --> 01:21:51,474
Go and help him or
we'll all be dust.

1252
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:53,642
(groaning)
(bones cracking)

1253
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,644
[Skid] I'm crushing you.

1254
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:59,048
(groaning)

1255
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:17,566
Die, Killjoy! (Roaring)

1256
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,535
Your ass is mine!

1257
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,238
(grunting)

1258
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:27,410
(groaning)

1259
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,182
[Sandie] Killjoy, here!

1260
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,851
[Squid] What's this?

1261
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:44,327
Ugh, aww man.

1262
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,231
(groaning)

1263
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:13,489
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1264
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,160
I have it! I have the power!

1265
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,795
The malice buffoon is mine!

1266
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:24,800
(groaning)

1267
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:29,105
(laughing)

1268
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,078
(splatting)

1269
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,616
(roaring)
(growling)

1270
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:47,623
Charge!

1271
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:53,829
(screaming)
(roaring)

1272
01:23:55,464 --> 01:24:00,469
(intense music)
(raucous fighting)

1273
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:06,409
(roaring)

1274
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,166
I've had enough.

1275
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:35,171
(intense music)
(raucous fighting)

1276
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:17,980
I've had enough of this.

1277
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:23,319
(electric zapping)

1278
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,925
So you got your
powers back, huh?

1279
01:25:29,925 --> 01:25:31,694
You think that I'd do mine?

1280
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:33,929
Where you going with that key?

1281
01:25:33,929 --> 01:25:35,030
You're not going anywhere.

1282
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:39,802
Ugh, virgin, you disgust me.

1283
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,772
(laughing) I got it!

1284
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:47,710
Oh, come on. Stop wasting
time, you have the key.

1285
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,213
Get in the elevator
and get out of here!

1286
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:51,280
Got it.

1287
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:55,017
Wait, just one second.

1288
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:56,252
[Batty] Oh, no.

1289
01:25:56,252 --> 01:25:57,420
I gotta know.

1290
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,654
Oh, don't give in.

1291
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,289
- Come on!
- Don't do it!

1292
01:26:01,624 --> 01:26:04,660
(gasping)

1293
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,094
Oh!

1294
01:26:11,234 --> 01:26:12,235
Fuck it!

1295
01:26:12,768 --> 01:26:14,370
(alarm blasting)

1296
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,539
(laughing) Why did I do that?
(alarm blasting)

1297
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:18,474
[Speaker] Self destruct
sequence initiated.

1298
01:26:18,474 --> 01:26:21,143
T-minus 60 seconds
to self destruct.

1299
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:23,246
Oh, man! We gotta
get out of here!

1300
01:26:23,246 --> 01:26:28,251
(alarm blasting)

1301
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:30,052
Out of the way, you big jerk.

1302
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:31,654
I got the key, I got the key.

1303
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:33,922
[Speaker] T-minus 50 seconds.

1304
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,591
Come on! Come on!

1305
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:37,393
Come on, get it in the hole!

1306
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:39,328
As usual, you're not helping!

1307
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:40,629
Alright, now shut up!

1308
01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:43,165
I got it, I got it.

1309
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,635
Twist it! Twist it!

1310
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:47,636
Which button?

1311
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:48,904
Terra firma!

1312
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:55,311
(screaming)

1313
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:01,450
[Speaker] T-minus... Oh I
see you're doing quite well.

1314
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,619
At this rate, you will
have no problem escaping.

1315
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:07,623
So I'll just hurry it up a bit.

1316
01:27:07,623 --> 01:27:09,725
T-minus one second.

1317
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,294
Kiss your ass goodbye.

1318
01:27:11,294 --> 01:27:13,929
(booming)

1319
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:17,733
(screaming)

1320
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:19,635
Can't we make this
thing go faster?

1321
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:20,669
I can...

1322
01:27:22,705 --> 01:27:24,006
Turbo!

1323
01:27:24,773 --> 01:27:27,376
(buzzing)

1324
01:27:29,612 --> 01:27:31,614
(screaming)

1325
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:36,619
(intense music)

1326
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:12,621
(police sirens)

1327
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,357
Where are we?

1328
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:16,692
Earth.

1329
01:28:18,761 --> 01:28:22,631
Yeah, we had a good
time, didn't we kid?

1330
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:25,534
(laughing) Oh, no.

1331
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:29,237
It's not so funny
anymore is it?

1332
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,440
Your name is...

1333
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,276
(laughing) Your name is...

1334
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,211
Your name is...

1335
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:40,516
Oh, that name's
gone. Gone forever.

1336
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:43,251
You know, I think I
even forgot it myself.

1337
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:44,920
(laughing)

1338
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,389
Hey, I saved your ass.

1339
01:28:47,022 --> 01:28:48,391
That's true, you did.

1340
01:28:48,391 --> 01:28:50,693
And for that, you get
a 60 second head start.

1341
01:28:51,394 --> 01:28:52,395
What?

1342
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:55,831
(speaking gibberish)

1343
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:56,865
[Sandie] What'd he say?

1344
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:59,602
Run bitch, run!

1345
01:28:59,602 --> 01:29:03,839
(laughing)

1346
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,942
So what do you
want to do now, baby?

1347
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:08,210
The usual.

1348
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:11,980
Murder, mayhem, destruction.

1349
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,417
And a really good martini.

1350
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:16,485
Yeah, sounds good.

1351
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:18,086
How long's it been Punchy?

1352
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,155
(speaking gibberish)

1353
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:23,626
30 seconds. Seems fair enough.

1354
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:25,093
Let's go!

1355
01:29:25,894 --> 01:29:30,098
(laughing)

1356
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,333
(intense music)

1357
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:33,536
I'm mother fucking Killjoy.

1358
01:29:35,237 --> 01:29:38,306
I was born a demon.

1359
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:44,513
I live for the
torment of humans.

1360
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:51,153
Who accuses me? Who accuses me?

1361
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,657
Don't you know who I am?

1362
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:59,495
I'm Killjoy! I'm Killjoy!

1363
01:30:00,463 --> 01:30:02,465
Alright, alright. I
get the point already.

1364
01:30:02,465 --> 01:30:07,470
(intense music)

1365
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:16,078
How long is this
gonna take exactly?

1366
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:20,516
I need an enema. I
need a beer enema.

1367
01:30:20,516 --> 01:30:23,118
I need a beer enema
and a Jello shot.

1368
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,691
That's just great.
Just what I need.

1369
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,730
That was disgusting. (Laughing)

1370
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:39,034
Who accuses me? Who accuses me?

1371
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:41,804
Don't you know who I am?

1372
01:30:45,808 --> 01:30:49,645
Who accuses me? Who accuses me?

1373
01:30:50,846 --> 01:30:54,483
From now on, I'm gonna
represent myself.

1374
01:30:56,051 --> 01:31:01,056
I'm Killjoy! I'm guilty
as hell! (Echoing)
